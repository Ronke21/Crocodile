<text>Reverdy Johnson (May 21, 1796February 10, 1876) was an American politician, statesman, and jurist from Annapolis, Maryland. He gained fame as a defense attorney, defending notables such as Sandford of the Dred Scott case, Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter at his courts-martial, and Mary Surratt, alleged conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. A former Whig, he was a strong supporter of the Union war effort. At first he opposed wartime efforts to abolish slavery until 1864, and in 1865 supported the 13th Amendment banning slavery.

Johnson served as United States Minister to the United Kingdom from 1868 to 1869.

==Early life==

Johnson was born on May 21, 1796, in Annapolis, Maryland. He was the son of a distinguished Maryland lawyer and politician, John Johnson (1770–1824), who served as Attorney General of Maryland from 1806 to 1811 and later Chancellor of Maryland, and Deborah (née Ghieselen) Johnson (1773–1847). His younger brothers were John Johnson Jr. (1798–1856), the last Chancellor of Maryland, and George Johnson (1817–1892).

He graduated from St. John&#x27;s College in 1812 and then studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1815. In August 1814, he served as a Private in Ens. William Brewer’s detachment of the 36th Maryland Militia, fighting at the Battle of Bladensburg.

==Career==
In 1817, Johnson moved to Baltimore, where he became a legal colleague of Luther Martin, William Pinkney and Roger B. Taney, the Attorney General and later Chief Justice of the United States from 1835 until 1864. He was appointed chief commissioner of insolvent debtors of Maryland in 1817. From 1821 until 1825 he served in the Maryland State Senate and then returned to practice law for two decades.

In 1842, while helping North Carolina Congressman Edward Stanly to ready himself for a duel with Virginia Congressman Henry Wise, Johnson fired a pistol at a tree, from which the ball rebounded and hit Johnson&#x27;s left eye, blinding that eye and triggering the gradual onset of a sympathetic deterioration of the other eye that worsened over the rest of his life, eventually leaving him almost completely blind.

===Federal politics===
From 1845 to 1849, Johnson represented Maryland in the United States Senate as a Whig.

From his confirmation by the Senate in March 1849 until July 1850, Johnson was Attorney General of the United States under President Zachary Taylor. He resigned that position soon after Millard Fillmore took office. While U.S. Attorney General, he was allowed to help Virginians Charles W. Russell and Alexander H.H. Stuart defend the Wheeling Suspension Bridge in his private capacity, that bridge also connecting two sections of the National Road as the first bridge crossing a major river west of the Appalachian Mountains. Although the plaintiffs technically won twice based on their argument that the bridge obstructed a navigable river, the bridge was never demolished (only repaired after wind damage) and further bridges were then constructed, including one over the Mississippi River at Rock Island in 1856.(which also led to litigation).

In November 1856, a large crowd, armed with guns and clubs, burned an effigy of Johnson on the railing of the Battle Monument in front of his house to protest a speech he made in New York against President Fillmore.

A conservative Democrat, Johnson supported Stephen A. Douglas in the presidential election of 1860. He represented the slave-owning defendant in the controversial 1857 case &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. However, Johnson was personally opposed to slavery and became a key figure in the effort to keep Maryland from seceding from the Union during the American Civil War.

He served as a Maryland delegate to the Peace Convention of 1861 and from 1861 to 1862 served in the Maryland House of Delegates. During this time he represented Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter at his court-martial, arguing that Porter&#x27;s distinguished record of service ought to put him beyond question. The officers on the court-martial, all handpicked by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, voted to convict Porter of cowardice and disobedience.

After the capture of New Orleans, President Abraham Lincoln commissioned Johnson to revise the decisions of the military commandant, General Benjamin F. Butler, in regard to foreign governments, and reversed all those decisions to the entire satisfaction of the administration. After the war, reflecting the diverse points of view held by his fellow statesmen, Johnson argued for a gentler Reconstruction effort than that advocated by the Radical Republicans.

===Return to the U.S. Senate===
In 1863, he again took a seat in the United States Senate, serving through 1868. &quot;The antislavery amendment caught Johnson&#x27;s eye, however, because it offered an indisputable constitutional solution to the problem of slavery.&quot; In 1864, in a speech on the Senate floor, Johnson &quot;cut loose from all Pro-Slavery associations by a bold declaration of strongest Anti Slavery sentiments,&quot; speaking in favor of the immediate and universal emancipation, and advocated the proposed amendment to the Constitution forever prohibiting slavery in the United States.

In 1865, he defended Mary Surratt before a military tribunal. Surratt was convicted and executed for plotting and aiding Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. In 1866, he was a delegate to the National Union Convention which attempted to build support for President Johnson. Senator Johnson&#x27;s report on the proceedings of the convention was entered into the record of President Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial. In the Senate, he also served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but he voted against passage of the amendment.

In 1866, he addressed the Senate regarding the appointment of provisional governors in the Southern States. In 1867, Johnson voted for the Reconstruction Act of 1867, the only Democrat to vote for a Reconstruction measure in 1866 or 1867.

===Ambassador to the United Kingdom===
On June 12, 1868, he was appointed minister to the United Kingdom, beginning his term on September 14, 1868. While in England, he was criticized for fraternizing with the Lairds, Wharncliffes, Roebucks, and Gregorios, of England, which was considered a blunder in diplomacy.

Soon after his arrival in England negotiated the Johnson-Clarendon Treaty for the settlement of disputes arising out of the Civil War, including the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims. The Senate, however, refused to advise and consent to ratification, and he returned home on the accession of General Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency.

===Later career===
Again resuming his legal practice, he defended Ku Klux Klan members against indictments brought under the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.

Even though out of office, Johnson continued to offer his opinion on public matters. In December 1874, he wrote to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stating that he hoped that after the next Presidential Election, &quot;the General Government will thereafter be brought back into the part of the Constitution, that the limits of its powers will be maintained, that the reserved authority of the States will be recognized, and that the rights of its citizens will be faithfully preserved.&quot; In December 1875, he wrote a letter to the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; discussing the potential impact of England&#x27;s purchase of a controlling interest in the Suez Canal.

In early 1876, Johnson was in Annapolis arguing the case of &quot;Baker v. Frick&quot; in the Court of Appeals and was a guest at the Maryland Governor&#x27;s Mansion. On February 10, during a dinner party at the mansion, he fell near a basement door, possibly after tripping, and was killed instantly after hitting his head on a sharp corner of the mansion&#x27;s granite base course and then again on the cobblestone pavement. He was the last surviving member of Taylor&#x27;s cabinet. Upon Johnson&#x27;s death, the Supreme Court Bar unanimously issued a statement that praised Johnson for his contributions to the Court, and expressed their condolences for his sudden passing.

==Personal life==

On November 16, 1819, Johnson married Mary Mackall Bowie (1801–1873), the sister of Rep. Thomas Fielder Bowie and the daughter of Thomas Contee Bowie (1771–1813) and Mary Mackall (née Bowie) Wootton (1776–1825), who were third cousins. Her mother was the widow of Turnor Wootton (d. 1797), whom she married in 1794 and had one child with, William Turner Wootton, and was the daughter of Maryland Gov. Robert Bowie (1750–1818). Together, Reverdy and Mary had 15 children, of which five daughters and three sons survived, including:

* Mary Johnson (1822–1915), who married Thomas Hollingsworth Morris (1817–1872), the son of John Boucher Morris (1785-1874) 
**Mary Johnson Morris and Thomas Hollingsworth Morris had the daughter Lydia Hollingsworth Morris (1857-1936) who married Hollins McKim (1825-1911). Their daughter Mary Camilla McKim married Huntington Williams MD.

* Edward Contee Johnson (1843–1905), who married Kate Moore (1871–1922)

After his death on February 10, 1876, Johnson was buried at the Greenmount Cemetery in East Baltimore. Johnson had been the last surviving member of the Taylor Cabinet.

==In popular culture==
In the 2011 film &quot;The Conspirator&quot;, Johnson is portrayed by actor Tom Wilkinson.

<text>The Escambray Mountains () are a mountain range in the central region of Cuba, in the provinces of Sancti Spíritus, Cienfuegos and Villa Clara.

==Overview==
The Escambray Mountains are located in the south-central region of the island, extending about from east to west, and from north to south. Their highest peak, Pico San Juan, rises to above sea level. The Escambray range is divided into two sections by the Agabama River. The western part is called the Guamuhaya Mountains, and the eastern part, raising between Trinidad and Sancti Spiritus, is best known as Sierra de Sancti Spíritus. After Pico San Juan, the highest points are Caballete de Casas, Gavilanes, Loma de Banao, Caja de Agua, and Pico Tuerto.

Topes de Collantes is a nature reserve park established in the south-eastern ranges of Escambray Mountains, protecting and showcasing caves, rivers, waterfalls, and canyons. The Valley de los Ingenios is developed at the south-eastern foot of the mountains, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The mountains were the theater of the Escambray Rebellion in 1959–1965. It was also a planned refuge during the Bay of Pigs Invasion; however, it was never used as such.

<text>Baker Street is a street in the Marylebone district of the City of Westminster in London. It is named after builder William Baker, who laid out the street in the 18th century. The area was originally high class residential, but now is mainly occupied by commercial premises.

The street is referenced in multiple popular works. Fictional detective Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street, a fictional address on the north of the street. A 1978 hit song by Gerry Rafferty was titled &quot;Baker Street&quot;.

==Location==
Baker Street is a busy thoroughfare, lying in postcode areas NW1/W1 and forming part of the A41. It used to run south from Regent&#x27;s Park, the junction with Park Road, parallel to Gloucester Place, meeting Marylebone Road, Portman Square and Wigmore Street. In 2019, the until-then one-way street was changed to accommodate lanes running in both directions.

At the junction with Wigmore Street, Baker Street turns into Orchard Street, which ends when it meets with Oxford Street. After Portman Square the road continues as Orchard Street.

The crossroads of Baker Street and Marylebone Road was historically known as &quot;Marylebone Circus&quot;, which is still its unofficial name.

==History==

Baker Street was laid out in the 18th century by the builder William Baker, after whom it is named.

===19th century===
In 1835, the first wax museum of Madame Tussauds was opened on Baker Street. The museum moved, just around the corner, to Marylebone Road in 1884. Also in 1835 the sculptor James Fillans came to live and work from 82 Baker Street.

Thomas Charles Druce ran the Baker Street Bazaar (which would become Druce &amp; Co. furniture manufacturers) until his death in 1864, and was later subject of the Druce Portland Case.

===20th century===
Residents of the prestigious mansion block, Chiltern Court on the Regent&#x27;s Park end of Baker Street include the novelists Arnold Bennett and H. G. Wells who are commemorated with a blue plaque.

In 1940 the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive moved to 64 Baker Street, they were often called the &quot;Baker Street Irregulars&quot; after Sherlock Holmes&#x27; gang of street urchins of the same name.

The Beatles&#x27; Apple Boutique was based at 94 Baker Street from 1967 to 1968.

A significant robbery of a branch of Lloyds Bank took place on Baker Street in 1971.

For many years the head office of Marks &amp; Spencer, formerly the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest retailer, was at &quot;Michael House&quot; (named in parallel with the group&#x27;s &quot;St Michael&quot; brand), 55 Baker Street, until the company relocated to the Paddington Basin in 2004. This was one of the best known corporate buildings in the United Kingdom, and has since been redeveloped as a modern office complex by London &amp; Regional Properties to a design by Make Architects and Expedition Engineering.

A London County Council blue plaque commemorates Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger who lived at 120 Baker Street from 1803 to 1804. British singer Dusty Springfield lived on Baker Street in the 1960s.

===21st century===
In February 2019, Baker Street was converted from a one-way southbound street to a two-way street.

==Buildings==
The Seychelles maintains a Consulate at 111 Baker Street.

==Transport==
The street is served by the London Underground&#x27;s Baker Street station, one of the world&#x27;s oldest and longest surviving underground stations. Next door is Transport for London&#x27;s lost property office.

==In popular culture==
* In fiction, Sherlock Holmes, Basil of Baker Street (&quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;), Sherlock Hound, Danger Mouse, Sexton Blake, Carland Cross and James Black of &quot;Case Closed&quot; have all resided along the road.
* &quot;Baker Street&quot; is a song by Gerry Rafferty, released in 1978. The song was a major worldwide hit, reaching Number 3 in the UK singles chart and Number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Rafferty wrote the song during a time he stayed at the home of friend who lived off Baker Street when in London.
* The song &quot;Some Girls&quot; by the Rolling Stones, from the album of same name released in 1978, includes the lyrics &quot;Give me all your money, give me all your gold / I&#x27;ll buy you a house in Baker Street, and give you half of what I own&quot;.
* &quot;Baker St. Muse&quot; is a song from Jethro Tull&#x27;s album &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, which was released in 1975.
* The 2008 film &quot;The Bank Job&quot; was loosely based on the 1971 Baker Street robbery of Lloyds Bank.

<doc id="645231" wikidata="Q1670087" url="?curid=645231" title="PowerBook G4">
<text>The PowerBook G4 is a series of notebook computers manufactured, marketed, and sold by Apple Computer between 2001 and 2006 as part of its PowerBook line of notebooks. The PowerBook G4 runs on the RISC-based PowerPC G4 processor, designed by the AIM (Apple/IBM/Motorola) development alliance and initially produced by Motorola. It was built later by Freescale, after Motorola spun off its semiconductor business under that name in 2004. The PowerBook G4 has had two different designs: one with a titanium body with a translucent black keyboard and a 15-inch screen; and another in an aluminum body with an aluminum-colored keyboard, in 12-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch sizes.

Between 2001 and 2003, Apple produced the titanium PowerBook G4; between 2003 and 2006, the aluminum models were produced. Both models were hailed for their modern design, long battery life, and processing power. When the aluminum PowerBook G4s were first released in January 2003, 12-inch and 17-inch models were introduced first, while the 15-inch model retained the titanium body until September 2003, when a new aluminum 15-inch PowerBook was released. The aluminum 15-inch model also includes a FireWire 800 port, which had been included with the 17-inch model since its debut nine months earlier.

The PowerBook G4 is the last revision of the PowerBook series, and was succeeded by the Intel-powered MacBook Pro line in the first half of 2006. The last version of macOS that most PowerBook G4 computers can run is Mac OS X Leopard, which was released in 2007. When Apple switched to Intel x86 processors in 2006, some design features of the PowerBook G4&#x27;s form and aluminum chassis were retained for the MacBook Pro.

==Titanium models==

The first PowerBook G4 models were announced at Steve Jobs&#x27; MacWorld Expo keynote on January 9, 2001. The two models featured a PowerPC G4 processor running at either 400 or 500 MHz, housed in a titanium-clad case that was 1 inch (25 mm) deep. This was 0.7 inches (18 mm) shallower than the G4&#x27;s predecessor, the PowerBook G3. The G4 was one of the first laptops to use a screen with a widescreen aspect ratio. It also featured a front-mounted slot-loading optical drive. The notebook was given the unofficial nickname &quot;TiBook&quot;, after the titanium case and the PowerBook brand name; it was sold alongside the cheaper iBook. The 1 GHz version of the titanium G4 is the last, and fastest, PowerBook that can natively run Mac OS 9 (version 9.2.2).

===Industrial design===
The initial design of the PowerBook G4 was developed by Apple hardware designers Jory Bell, Nick Merz, and Danny Delulis. Quanta, an original design manufacturer, also helped in the design. The new machine was a sharp departure from the black plastic, curvilinear PowerBook G3 models that preceded it. The orientation of the Apple logo on the computer&#x27;s lid was switched so that it would &quot;read&quot; correctly to onlookers when the computer was in use. PowerBook G3 and prior models presented it right-side-up from the perspective of the computer&#x27;s owner when the lid was closed. Apple&#x27;s industrial design team, headed by British designer Jonathan Ive, converged around a minimalist aesthetic—the titanium G4&#x27;s design language laid the groundwork for the aluminum PowerBook G4, the MacBook Pro, the Power Mac G5, the flat-screen iMac, the Xserve, and the Mac mini.

=== Reception ===
In a review, &quot;Macworld&quot; Andrew Gore praised the PowerBook&#x27;s weight, wider screen, and Velocity Engine, but criticized the difficulty of replacing the hard drive. In a battery test, he found that Apple&#x27;s stated 5 hours of battery life could only be achieved with the screen dimmed and the processor clocked down to 300 MHz, though he described battery life in normal use, of slightly over three hours, as &quot;very respectable&quot;. &quot;ATPM&quot; Trevor Boehm rated it &quot;excellent&quot;, describing it as pricy but a good desktop replacement, and praising its speed, screen, and ports, though he criticized the trackpad as oversensitive and inconvenient for drag and drop. &quot;PC World&quot; Carla Thornton praised its design, screen and performance, but criticized its graphics, DVD speed, battery life and price.

===Quality issues===
The hinges on the titanium PowerBook display are notorious for breaking under typical use. Usually the hinge (which is shaped like an L) will break just to the left of where it attaches to the lower case on the right hinge, and just to the right on the left hinge (where the right hinge is on the right side of the computer when the optical drive is facing the user). When the 667 MHz and 800 MHz &quot;DVI&quot; PowerBooks were introduced, Apple changed the hinge design slightly to strengthen it. At least one aftermarket manufacturer began producing sturdier replacement hinges to address this problem, though actually performing the repair is difficult as the display bezel is glued together. In addition some discolouration, bubbling or peeling of paint on the outer bezel occurred, notably around the area where the palm would rest while using the trackpad, and around the rear of the hinges where paint on the back of the machine was often worn off. This appeared on early models but not on later titanium PowerBooks.

===Display issues===
The video cable is routed around the left-side hinge. This will cause the cable to weaken under heavy usage. Many owners have reported display problems such as random lines or a jumbled screen, although a few owners have replaced just the video cable to successfully resolve this problem. There is also a backlight cable that might fail; The best option is to replace either or both cables before replacing LCD screen.

===Technical specifications===


==Aluminum models==

In 2003, Apple introduced a new line of PowerBook G4s with 12-, 15-, and 17-inch screens and aluminum cases. The new notebooks not only brought a different design to the PowerBook G4 line but also laid down the foundation for Apple&#x27;s notebook design for the next five years, replaced initially in January 2008 by the MacBook Air and the subsequent MacBook and MacBook Pro redesigns in October. The 15&quot; titanium model was still available until September 16, 2003, when the aluminum model replaced it. Notably, the 12&quot; model brought a welcome return to the Apple subnotebook configuration, conspicuously lacking in their product line since the discontinuation of the PowerBook 2400 in 1998. While the titanium PowerBook G4s were capable of booting into Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X operating systems, the aluminum PowerBook G4s could only boot into Mac OS X. Both series of machines could run Mac OS 9 in Classic mode from within Mac OS X.

===Industrial design===
The aluminum PowerBook G4 was designed by Apple&#x27;s Vice President of Industrial Design, Jonathan Ive, and used a radically different design from the preceding titanium models. The most obvious change was the use of aluminum instead of titanium to manufacture the body. The keyboard, which was originally black, was changed to match the color of the body. Additionally, the aluminum keyboard was backlit on the 17&quot; model and on one of the 15&quot; models. This was the first case of keyboard internal backlighting seen on a notebook computer. The design was considered superior to most other notebooks when it debuted in 2003, and consequently, it made the PowerBook G4 one of the most desirable notebooks on the market. The external design of Apple&#x27;s professional laptops continued to remain similar to the aluminum PowerBook G4 until Apple announced the Unibody Macbook Pro at its special event on October 14, 2008.

=== Reception ===
&quot;CNET&quot; Molly Wood described the 17-inch PowerBook as a &quot;rock star&#x27;s notebook&quot;, praising its design, screen, bundled software suite (which included iLife, QuickBooks, OmniOutliner and OmniGraffle), and backlit keyboard, though she said that the keyboard backlighting required the room to be quite dark, and that there was no option to increase its sensitivity. In benchmarks, she found that the 12-inch, 15-inch and 17-inch models all had about the same &quot;acceptable&quot; battery life, and that the PowerBooks had similar performance to the 17-inch iMac desktop.

===Quality issues===
Some owners have experienced failure of the lower memory slot on some of the 15&quot; models, with the typical repair being the replacement of the logic board. Apple had started a Repair Extension Program concerning the issue, but it has been noted that some models displaying the issue have not been included. This leaves some PowerBook G4 owners with a maximum of only 1 GB of RAM to use instead of a full 2 GB.

Apple previously had a Repair Extension Program to fix the &quot;white spot&quot; issue on its 15&quot; PowerBook displays.

There has also been a rash of reports concerning sudden and pervasive sleeping of 1.5 and 1.67 GHz models known as Narcoleptic Aluminum PowerBook Syndrome. Symptoms include the PowerBook suddenly entering sleep mode, regardless of the battery level or whether the PowerBook is plugged in. One cause is the ambient light sensing, and associated instruction set coding, with possible keyboard backlight and sleep light issues accompanying the so-called &quot;narcolepsy&quot;. Another cause is the trackpad area heat sensor; system logs report &quot;Power Management received emergency overtemp signal. Going to sleep.&quot;.

To correct this, service groups will often replace the logic board or power converter, but the actual fix (depending on the model) for the first cause is to replace or remove the left or right ambient light sensors; and for the second cause, disconnect, remove, or replace the heat sensor, or the entire top case which holds the trackpad heat sensor. Alternatively, there are reports which detail success in removing certain sensor kernel extensions or rebuilding the kernel using the Darwin Open Source project after commenting out the relevant codice_1 call; permanent resolution of the sleep issue in this manner is little documented.

The 1.67 GHz model may suffer from manufacturing or design defects in its display. Initial reports pointed to this only being a problem with type M9689 17&quot; PowerBooks introduced in Q2 2005, but then this problem was also seen in displays replaced by Apple Service Providers in this period (e.g. because of the bright spots issue). The devices were the last 17&quot; models shipped with the matte 1440×900 pixel low-resolution display. After many months of usage, the displays may show permanently shining lines of various colors stretching vertically across the LCD. Often this will start with one-pixel-wide vertical lines being &quot;stuck&quot; in an &quot;always-on&quot; mode. Various sites have been set up documenting this issue.

On May 20, 2005, Apple recalled 12-inch iBook G4, and 12- and 15-inch PowerBook G4 batteries (model number A1061, first 5 characters HQ441 – HQ507 for the iBook, model # A1079, serial # 3X446 – 3X510 for 12&quot; PowerBook, model # A1078, serial # 3X446 – 3X509.) They were recalled due to short-circuiting which caused overheating and explosion. The batteries were made by LG Chemical, in Taiwan and China. Apple has since removed the recall from its website.

=== Technical specifications ===


==Discontinuation==
One major factor that led to the discontinuation of the PowerBook G4 was Apple&#x27;s internal experimentation with the PowerPC G5 for the company&#x27;s next line professional-grade notebooks at that time. However, the G5, which also powered the Power Mac G5 and iMac G5, proved to be too power-hungry and heat-intensive to use in a notebook form factor. Stalled development of the mobile G5 is also said to be another main factor in the Mac&#x27;s transition from PowerPC to Intel processors.

After awaiting a new professional-grade notebook to replace the G4, on January 10, 2006, Apple released the 15&quot; MacBook Pro, its first Intel-based notebook. A 17&quot; version of the MacBook Pro followed on April 24, 2006. The new &quot;MacBook Pro&quot; name was given to the new series of notebooks after Apple changed the portable naming schemes from &quot;Power&quot; for professional products (and &quot;i&quot; for consumer products), in favor of including &quot;Mac&quot; in the title of all computer lines, with the suffix &quot;Pro&quot; denoting a pro product. Finally, on May 16, 2006, the 12&quot; PowerBook G4 and the G4 iBook were discontinued and replaced by the 13.3&quot; MacBook, ending the whole PowerBook line.

However, a replacement for the 12&quot; subnotebook form factor (i.e. the 12&quot; PowerBook G4) was not immediately forthcoming; the MacBook Air, released in 2008, served as an indirect replacement while the 13&quot; MacBook Pro released in 2009 is the direct replacement for the 12&quot; PowerBook G4. Apple returned to the 12&quot; screen size with the MacBook released in 2015.

<text>John Herbert Chapman (August 28, 1921 – September 28, 1979) was a Canadian space researcher. He started his career with his work on radio propagation and the ionosphere.

Chapman grew up in London, Ontario, the son of Lt. Col. Lloyd Chapman and Kathleen Chapman. He received his BSc (Honors) from The University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario in 1948, and later received a Master of Science degree and a Ph.D. in physics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. After his studies at university, Chapman got his first position in the government with the Defence Research Board (DRB). He was then promoted to the position of section leader of the ionospheric propagation unit at the Defense Research Telecommunications Establishment , which is now the Communications Research Centre (CRC) in 1951 at Shirley&#x27;s Bay, a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus. He was also a superintendent.

While at Shirley&#x27;s Bay, Chapman worked on a number of projects. One of the projects he directed was the ground-breaking Canadian satellite called Alouette. The DRTE having no experience developing satellites had to work quite hard to think of and counter all the difficulties they would face in the harsh environment of space. Because of his work on Alouette he was promoted to chairman of a government study group to study the upper atmosphere and space programs in Canada.

While chairman, Chapman compiled his findings into &quot;The Chapman Report&quot; in which he argued that Canada needed to redirect its space program in order to continue its ongoing research more effectively and efficiently. &quot;The Chapman Report&quot; remains an important document in helping the Canadian Space Agency choose what they should work on when it comes to space programs.

Chapman was given awards for his work in aerospace technology. The first was given by the Royal Society of Canada in 1966; he also received an Engineering medal from the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario and the Dillinger Gold Medal from the International Union of Radio Scientists the same year. In 1967 Chapman was awarded The Chree Medal and Prize and the McCurdy award from the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institution.

Chapman was a member of the Royal Society of Canada. He was also part of the National Research Council (NRC) Associate committee on Space Research, a council of the top Canadian space scientists. He also served on the International Union of Radio Science and the American Geophysical Union.

Chapman died in Vancouver, BC in 1979. After his death, the Canadian Space Agency was formed to organize and give Canada its own space agency to create a central place to meet and work on Canadian space projects. With this new organization, Canada has been able to construct and launch new projects into orbit. One of the most important Canadian projects is Canadarm, which has become used frequently on the International Space Station (or ISS for short).

When the headquarters building of the Canadian Space Agency was completed in 1992, it was named the John H. Chapman Space Centre, in his honour.

Asteroid &quot;(14163) JohnChapman&quot; is named after Chapman.

<text>[[United Nations]] [[List of the UN resolutions concerning Israel|Security Council Resolution]] 425, adopted on 19 March 1978, five days after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the context of Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon and the Lebanese Civil War, called on Israel to withdraw immediately its forces from Lebanon and established the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL). It was adopted by 12 votes to none; Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union abstained, and China did not participate. 

==Background==
On 11 March 1978, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operatives, led by Dalal Mugrabi, carried out the Coastal Road massacre within Israel which resulted in the deaths of 37 Israelis, including 13 children, and 76 wounded. In response, Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon from which the PLO operated regularly during the 1970s. Starting on the night of 14–15 March and culminating a few days later, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops occupied the entire southern part of the country except for the city of Tyre and its surrounding area. This operation is known in Israel as Operation Litani, the stated objective of which was to clear out PLO bases in Lebanon south of the Litani River, in order to better secure northern Israel and to support the Christian Lebanese militias in the course of the Lebanese Civil War - most notably the Free Lebanon Army. On 15 March 1978 the Lebanese government submitted a strong protest to the United Nations Security Council against the Israeli invasion, stating that it had no connection with the Palestinian operation. 

On 19 March 1978 the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 425, in which it called upon Israel to cease immediately its military action and withdraw its forces from Lebanese territory. It also established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the objective of which was to bring about and confirm withdrawal of Israeli forces, restore international peace and security, and to help the Lebanese Government restore its effective authority in southern Lebanon.

==The resolution text==
==Implementation==
The first UNIFIL troops arrived in Lebanon on 23 March 1978, just four days after the resolution was passed, and Israel withdrew its forces by June 1978. Israel maintained a presence through its proxy South Lebanon Army.

==Aftermath== 
PLO attacks from south Lebanon continued, and Israel launched a larger-scale invasion in June 1982 in which Israeli and Lebanese Christian forces occupied the Lebanese capital city of Beirut in the 1982 Lebanon War. In the aftermath of the IDF’s retreat south Israel maintained a security zone inside Lebanon. In May 2000, Israel withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon. Before the withdrawal, opposition voices inside Israel pressured the government to withdraw, as they saw no valid reason to stay there and sustain Lebanese attacks.

The UN Secretary-General concluded that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had indeed withdrawn its forces from Lebanon, in accordance with resolution 425 (1978). The border recognized by the UN is known as the &quot;Blue Line&quot;.

Some Lebanese parties (most notably Iranian proxy Hezbollah), however, claim that Israel is still keeping Lebanese land under its occupation, mainly in Shebaa Farms. Israel and the UN concur that Shebaa Farms is part of the Golan (annexed in Israel’s view, occupied in eyes of UN), and therefore it is not included under resolution 425.

Since the adoption of the Resolution and Israel’s withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, there have been a number of cross-border incidents.

As at August 2021, Lebanon had not extended effective control over southern Lebanon, as it had been called upon since 1978, and repeated by UN Resolution 1391 of 2002, [[UN Resolution 1496] of 2003 and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|UN Resolution 1701] after the [[2006 Lebanon War|second Lebanese War]] in 2006. Hezbollah has periodically attacked Israel from Lebanon. Israel has lodged multiple complaints regarding Lebanon&#x27;s failure to take control of southern Lebanon.

<text>The Senate of the Republic of Colombia () is the upper house of the Congress of Colombia, with the lower house being the Chamber of Representatives. The Senate has 108 members elected for concurrent (non-rotating) four-year terms.

==Electoral system==

According to the Colombian Constitution (1991), 100 senators (&quot;senadores&quot;) are elected from a single national constituency, and another two are elected in a special national constituency for Indigenous communities. Following the peace process (2012–2016), the FARC (party: Comunes) gets another five seats and the presidential opposition gets one more, for a total of 108.

Colombian citizens living outside the country are eligible to vote, although, unlike in the lower house, they have no special representatives in the Senate.

For elections to the Senate in the national constituency, political parties or other movements and groups run single lists, with a number of candidates not exceeding the total number of seats to be filled. The current electoral system, adopted in 2003 and modified in 2009 and 2015, requires party lists to pass a 3% threshold in order to obtain representation. For the 2006 and 2010 elections, the threshold was set at 2%, before being raised by the 2009 reform to 3%.

Parties may run a closed list, with the order of candidates pre-determined, or opt for preferential voting (open list), where the position of candidates on the list is reordered based on the individual preference votes of the voters. In senatorial elections, voters choosing a party running a closed list only vote for the party list; voters who choose a party running an open list may indicate their candidate of preference among the names displayed on the ballot, if the voter does not indicate a preference and only votes for the party, the vote is valid for purposes of the threshold but not for reordering the list based on preferential votes.

For the two seats reserved to Indigenous communities, the electoral quota system is used (total votes divided by the total seats), with the threshold in this case being 30% of the electoral quota.

==Eligibility==
To be a senator, a person must be a natural-born Colombian citizen over the age of 30 at the time of the election. Representatives of indigenous communities seeking election as a representative of indigenous communities in the Senate must have held a traditional authority role in their community or have been the leader of an indigenous organization.

There are general rules of ineligibility and incompatibility which apply to both houses of Congress, explained here. In addition, general rules on the replacement and non-replacement of members depending on different circumstances also apply to both houses of Congress.

==Exclusive powers of the Senate==

# Approve or reject the resignations of the President and the Vice President.
# Approve or reject all military promotions conferred by the government on commissioned officers.
# Grant leaves of absence for the President in cases other than sickness, and determine the qualification of the Vice President to serve as President. 
# Allow for the transit of foreign troops through Colombian territory.
# Authorize the Government to declare war on a foreign nation. 
# Elect the Constitutional Court justices. 
# Elect the Attorney General.

===Judicial powers===

The Congress&#x27; judicial powers are divided between the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. The Senate is responsible for taking cognizance of the charges brought by the House of Representatives against the President (or whoever replaces him/her) and members of the &quot;Comisión de Aforados&quot; even if they may have ceased to exercise their functions. The Senate determines the validity of the charges concerning actions or omissions that occurred in the exercise of these duties.

The Senate may assign the preliminary investigation to a group of its members, but the judgement is pronounced in a public session with at least two-thirds of senators in attendance.

In the trials to be conducted before the Senate, the accused is automatically suspended from his/her office once the charges brought have been admitted. If the charge refers to offences committed in the exercise of his/her duties or unworthiness to serve for misconduct, the Senate may only discharge him/her from office and/or temporarily or permanently strip the accused of their political rights. The accused, however, is brought to trial before the Supreme Court of Justice, if the evidence demonstrates the individual to be responsible for an infraction deserving of other penalties. If the charge refers to common crimes, the Senate confines itself to declaring if there are grounds for further measures; in the affirmative, the accused is placed at the disposition of the Supreme Court.

<doc id="645246" wikidata="Q1205349" url="?curid=645246" title="Callback (computer programming)">
<text>In computer programming, a callback is a function that is stored as data (a reference) and designed to be called by another function often &quot;back&quot; to the original abstraction layer.

A function that accepts a callback parameter may be designed to call back before returning to its caller which is known as &quot;synchronous&quot; or &quot;blocking&quot;. The function that accepts a callback may be designed to store the callback so that it can be called back after returning which is known as &quot;asynchronous&quot;, &quot;non-blocking&quot; or &quot;deferred&quot;.

Programming languages support callbacks in different ways such as function pointers, lambda expressions and blocks.

== Analogy ==

To aid understanding the concept, the following is an analogy from real life.

A customer visits a store to place an order. This is like the first call.

The customer gives to a clerk a list of items, a check to cover their cost and delivery instructions. These are the parameters of the first call including the callback which is the delivery instructions. It is understood that the check will be cashed and that the instructions will be followed.

When the staff are able, they deliver the items as instructed which is like calling the callback.

Notably, the delivery need not be made by the clerk who took the order. A callback need not be called by the function that accepted the callback as a parameter. 

Also, the delivery need not be made directly to the customer. A callback need not be to the calling function. In fact, a function would generally not pass itself as a callback.
Some find the use of &quot;back&quot; to be misleading since the call is (generally) not back to the original caller as it is for a telephone call.

== Use ==

A blocking callback runs in the execution context of the function that passes the callback. A deferred callback can run in a different context such as during interrupt or from a thread. As such, a deferred callback can be used for synchronization and delegating work to another thread.

=== Event handling ===

A callback can be used for event handling. Often, consuming code registers a callback for a particular type of event. When that event occurs, the callback is called.

Callbacks are often used to program the graphical user interface (GUI) of a program that runs in a windowing system. The application supplies a reference to a custom callback function for the windowing system to call. The windowing system calls this function to notify the application of events like mouse clicks and key presses.

=== Asynchronous action ===

A callback can be used to implement asynchronous processing. A caller requests an action and provides a callback to be called when the action completes which might be long after the request is made.

=== Polymorphism ===

A callback can be used to implement polymorphism. In the following pseudocode, can take either or .
def write_status(string message):
 write(stdout, message)
def write_error(string message):
 write(stderr, message)
def say_hi(write):
 write(&quot;Hello world&quot;)
== Implementation ==

The callback technology is implemented differently by programming language.

In assembly, C, C++, Pascal, Modula2 and other languages, a callback function is stored internally as a function pointer. Using the same storage allows different languages to directly share callbacks without a design-time or runtime interoperability layer. For example, the Windows API is accessible via multiple languages, compilers and assemblers.

C++ also allows objects to provide an implementation of the function call operation. The Standard Template Library accepts these objects (called &quot;functors&quot;) as parameters.

Many dynamic languages, such as JavaScript, Lua, Python, Perl and PHP, allow a function object to be passed.

CLI languages such as C# and VB.NET provide a type-safe encapsulating function reference known as delegate.

Events and event handlers, as used in .NET languages, provide for callbacks.

Functional languages generally support first-class functions, which can be passed as callbacks to other functions, stored as data or returned from functions.

Many languages, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, C++ (11+), C# and VB.NET (new versions) and most functional languages, support lambda expressions, unnamed functions with inline syntax, that generally acts as callbacks..

In some languages, including Scheme, ML, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, PHP (since 5.3.0), C++ (11+), Java (since 8), and many others, a lambda can be a closure, i.e. can access variables locally defined in the context in which the lambda is defined.

In an object-oriented programming language such as Java versions before function-valued arguments, the behavior of a callback can be achieved by passing an object that implements an interface. The methods of this object are callbacks.

In PL/I and ALGOL 60 a callback procedure may need to be able to access local variables in containing blocks, so it is called through an &quot;entry variable&quot; containing both the entry point and context information. 

==Example code==

=== C ===

Callbacks have a wide variety of uses, for example in error signaling: a Unix program might not want to terminate immediately when it receives SIGTERM, so to make sure that its termination is handled properly, it would register the cleanup function as a callback. Callbacks may also be used to control whether a function acts or not: Xlib allows custom predicates to be specified to determine whether a program wishes to handle an event.

In the following C code, function codice_1 uses parameter codice_2 as a blocking callback. codice_1 is called with codice_4 which acts as a callback function. When run the output is: &quot;Value: 42&quot;.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void print_number(int (*get_number)(void)) {
 int val = get_number();
 printf(&quot;Value: %d\n&quot;, val);

int get_answer_to_most_important_question(void) {
 return 42;

int main(void) {
 print_number(get_answer_to_most_important_question);
 return 0;


=== C++ ===

In C++, functor can be used in addition to function pointer.

=== C# ===

In the following C# code, 
method codice_5 uses parameter codice_6 as a blocking callback. codice_5 is called with codice_8 which acts as a callback function. When run, the following is written to the console: &quot;Callback was: Hello world&quot;.
public class MainClass
 static void Main(string[] args)
 Helper helper = new Helper();
 helper.Method(Log);

 static void Log(string str)
 Console.WriteLine($&quot;Callback was: {str}&quot;);
}

public class Helper
 public void Method(Action&lt;string&gt; callback)
 callback(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
}
=== Kotlin ===

In the following Kotlin code, function codice_9 uses parameter codice_10 as a blocking callback. codice_9 is called with codice_12 which acts as a callback function. Running this will tell the user that the answer to their question is &quot;42&quot;.
fun main() {
 print(&quot;Enter the most important question: &quot;)
 val question = readLine()
 askAndAnswer(question, ::getAnswerToMostImportantQuestion)

fun getAnswerToMostImportantQuestion(): Int {
 return 42

fun askAndAnswer(question: String?, getAnswer: () -&gt; Int) {
 println(&quot;Question: $question&quot;)
 println(&quot;Answer: ${getAnswer()}&quot;)


=== JavaScript ===

In the following JavaScript code, function codice_13 uses parameter codice_14 as a blocking callback. codice_13 is called with codice_16 and then with codice_17 which act as callback functions.
function calculate(a, b, operate) {
 return operate(a, b);
function multiply(a, b) {
 return a * b;
function sum(a, b) {
 return a + b;
// outputs 20
alert(calculate(10, 2, multiply));
// outputs 12
alert(calculate(10, 2, sum));
The collection method of the jQuery library uses the function passed to it as a blocking callback. It calls the callback for each item of the collection. For example:
$(&quot;li&quot;).each(function(index) {
 console.log(index + &quot;: &quot; + $(this).text());


Deferred callbacks are commonly used for handling events from the user, the client and timers. Examples can be found in , Ajax and codice_18.

In addition to using callbacks in JavaScript source code, C functions that take a function are supported via js-ctypes.

=== Red and REBOL ===

The following REBOL/Red code demonstrates callback use.

* As alert requires a string, form produces a string from the result of calculate
* The get-word! values (i.e., :calc-product and :calc-sum) trigger the interpreter to return the code of the function rather than evaluate with the function.
* The datatype! references in a block! [float! integer!] restrict the type of values passed as arguments.
Red [Title: &quot;Callback example&quot;]

calculate: func [
 num1 [number!] 
 num2 [number!] 
 callback-function [function!]
 callback-function num1 num2

calc-product: func [
 num1 [number!] 
 num2 [number!]
 num1 * num2

calc-sum: func [
 num1 [number!] 
 num2 [number!]
 num1 + num2

; alerts 75, the product of 5 and 15
alert form calculate 5 15 :calc-product

; alerts 20, the sum of 5 and 15
alert form calculate 5 15 :calc-sum
=== Rust ===
Rust have the , and traits.
fn call_with_one&lt;F&gt;(func: F) -&gt; usize
 where F: Fn(usize) -&gt; usize {
 func(1)

let double = |x| x * 2;
assert_eq!(call_with_one(double), 2);
===Lua===
A color tweening example using the Roblox engine that takes an optional callback:
wait(1)
local DT = wait()

function tween_color(object, finish_color, fade_time)
 local step_r = finish_color.r - object.BackgroundColor3.r
 local step_g = finish_color.g - object.BackgroundColor3.g
 local step_b = finish_color.b - object.BackgroundColor3.b
 local total_steps = 1/(DT*(1/fade_time))
 local completed;
 coroutine.wrap(function()
 for i = 0, 1, DT*(1 / fade_time) do
 object.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new (
 object.BackgroundColor3.r + (step_r/total_steps),
 object.BackgroundColor3.g + (step_g/total_steps),
 object.BackgroundColor3.b + (step_b/total_steps)
 wait()
 end
 if completed then
 completed()
 end
 end)()
 return {
 done = function(callback)
 completed = callback
 end
end

tween_color(some_object, Color3.new(1, 0, 0), 1).done(function()
 print &quot;Color tweening finished!&quot;
end)
=== Python ===

In the following Python code, function accepts a parameter that is used as a blocking callback. is called with which acts as a callback function.
def square(val):
 return val ** 2
def calculate(operate, val):
 return operate(val)
# outputs: 25
calculate(square, 5)

julia&gt; square(val) = val^2
square (generic function with 1 method)
julia&gt; calculate(operate, val) = operate(val)

<text>Fenvalerate is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide. It is a mixture of four optical isomers which have different insecticidal activities. The 2-S &quot;alpha&quot; (or SS) configuration, known as esfenvalerate, is the most insecticidally active isomer. Fenvalerate consists of about 23% of this isomer.

Fenvalerate is an insecticide of moderate mammalian toxicity. In laboratory animals, central nervous system toxicity is observed following acute or short-term exposure. Fenvalerate has applications against a wide range of pests including some of the more destructive such as the &quot;Helicoverpa assulta&quot;. Residue levels are minimized by low application rates. Fenvalerate is most toxic to bees and fish. It is found in some emulsifiable concentrates, ULV, wettable powders, slow release formulations, insecticidal fogs, and granules. It is most commonly used to control insects in food, feed, and cotton products, and for the control of flies and ticks in barns and stables. Fenvalerate does not affect plants, but is active for an extended period of time. 

Fenvalerate may irritate the skin and eyes on contact, and is also harmful if swallowed.

<text>Frederick Frelinghuysen (April 13, 1753April 13, 1804) was an American lawyer, soldier, and senator from New Jersey. A graduate of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), Frederick went on to become an officer during the American Revolutionary War. In addition, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was a United States Senator from New Jersey from 1793 until 1796, and served as the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 1801.

==Early life==
He was born at the Old Dutch Parsonage near Somerville in the Province of New Jersey to John Frelinghuysen (1727–1754) and Dinah Van Berg (1725–1807) of Amsterdam. His father, John, was the son of the immigrant minister Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen, the progenitor of the Frelinghuysen family in New Jersey.

He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1770, and was the sole instructor at Queen&#x27;s College, New Brunswick (now Rutgers University) from 1771 to 1774. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1774, practicing law in Somerset County, New Jersey.

==Military and political career==
With the coming of the American Revolution, he became a member of the provincial congress of New Jersey from 1775 to 1776. In the War of Independence he served in the New Jersey militia as an artillery captain, seeing action at Trenton and Monmouth. In 1779 he served as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. He served as a clerk to the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County, New Jersey from 1781 to 1789. He also served in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1784 and again from 1800 to 1804.

He was a member of the New Jersey convention that ratified the United States Constitution in 1787. He was a member of the New Jersey Legislative Council (now the New Jersey Senate) representing Somerset County from 1790 to 1792.

President George Washington appointed him as brigadier general in the United States Army for the 1790 campaign against the western Indians. Frelinghuysen was elected to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1793, to November 12, 1796, when he resigned. He was the runner-up in the 1793 New Jersey gubernatorial election, losing to Richard Howell. He was commissioned major general in the New Jersey militia in 1794, during the Whiskey Rebellion.

==Personal life==
He married Gertrude Schenck (1753–1794), the daughter of Helena Magdalena Van Liew and Hendrick (Henry) Joahnnes Schenck. Together, they had five children:

* General John Frelinghuysen (1776–1833)
* Maria Frelinghuysen (1778–1832)
* Theodore Frelinghuysen (1787–1862), a lawyer and New Jersey politician
* Frederick Frelinghuysen (1788–1820)
*Catharine Frelinghuysen (1790-1865)

After his first wife Gertrude&#x27;s death in 1794, Frederick Sr. married Ann Yard (1764–1839).

Frelinghuysen died in Millstone, New Jersey, on April 13, 1804, his 51st birthday, and was buried at the Weston Burying Ground on the border of Manville, New Jersey and Bound Brook, New Jersey. His tombstone reads as follows:
===Descendants===
Among his other descendants are Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (1817–1885), U.S. Senator and Secretary of State; Joseph Sherman Frelinghuysen (1869–1948) US Senator from New Jersey; Peter Frelinghuysen, Jr. (1916–2011) New Jersey Congressman; and Rodney Frelinghuysen (born 1946) New Jersey Congressman.

<text>Seokguram () is a hermitage and part of the Bulguksa temple complex in Gyeongju, South Korea. It and Bulguksa are both on the mountain Tohamsan, although the two are separated by distance of around . The grotto overlooks the East Sea and rests 750 meters above sea level. In 1962, it was designated the 24th National Treasure of South Korea. In 1995, Seokguram was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List together with the Bulguksa Temple. It exemplifies some of the best Buddhist sculptures in the world.

The Seokguram Grotto is said to have been built by Kim Daeseong and originally called Seokbulsa (). Construction began in either 742 or 751, during the cultural peak of the kingdom Unified Silla. The grotto was completed by the Silla court in 774, shortly after Kim&#x27;s death.

The grotto is currently one of the best known cultural destinations in South Korea. A viewing of the sunrise over the sea, which is visible from near the seated Buddha&#x27;s perch, is especially popular.

==Architecture==

The tradition of carving the image of Buddha in stone, holy images, and stupas into cliff walls and natural caves began in India, for the drawing of their own gods into rock to make statues. This practice was transferred to China and then Korea. The geology of the Korean Peninsula, which contains an abundance of hard granite, is not conducive to carving stone images into cliff walls.

The basic layout of the grotto includes an arched entrance which leads into a rectangular antechamber and then a narrow corridor, which is lined with bas-reliefs, and then finally leads into the main rotunda. The centerpiece of the granite sanctuary is a Buddha statue seated in the main chamber. The identity of the Buddha is still debated. The Buddha is seated on a lotus throne with legs crossed. The Buddha is surrounded by fifteen panels of bodhisattvas, arhats and ancient Indian gods in the rotunda and is accompanied by ten statues in niches along the rotunda wall. Forty different figures representing Buddhist principles and teachings are in the grotto. The grotto was built around these statues to protect them from weathering. The ceiling of the Seokguram Grotto is decorated with half moons; the top is decorated with a lotus flower. Silla architects used symmetry and apparently employed the concept of the golden rectangle.

The grotto is shaped by hundreds of different granite stones. No mortar was used in its construction; the structure is held together by stone rivets. The construction of the grotto also utilized natural ventilation. The dome of the rotunda is 6.84 meters to 6.58 meters in diameter.

The Seokguram Grotto is symbolic of a spiritual journey into Nirvana. Pilgrims were to start at Bulguksa or at the foot of Tohamsan, a holy mountain to the Silla.

===Sculpture within the grotto===

The main Buddha of the grotto is a highly regarded piece of Buddhist art. It is 3.5 meters in height and sits on a 1.34-meter tall lotus pedestal. The Buddha is realistic in form and probably represents the Seokgamoni (Shakyamuni) Buddha; the position of the Buddha&#x27;s hands symbolizes enlightenment. The Buddha has an usnisa, a symbol of the wisdom. The drapery on the Buddha, such as the fan-shaped folds at the crossed-legs of the Buddha, exemplifies Korean interpretations of Indian prototypes. Unlike other Buddhas that have a halo attached to the back of the head, the Buddha at Seokguram creates the illusion of a halo by placing a granite roundel carved with lotus petals on the back wall of the rotunda. The pedestal is made of three parts; the top and bottom are carved with lotus petals while the central shaft consists of eight pillars.

Accompanying the main Buddha, in relief, are three bodhisattvas, ten disciples, and two Hindu gods along the wall of the rotunda. Ten statues of bodhisattvas, saints, and the faithful are located in niches above the bas-reliefs. The ten disciples were disciples of Seokgamoni and are lined five on each side of the Avalokitesvara. Their features suggest a Greek influence. The two bodhisattvas are of Manjusri and Samantabhadra. The two Hindu gods are Brahma and Indra.

The Four Heavenly Kings guard the corridor. There are also images of Vajrapanis, which are guardian figures and they are on the walls of the entrance to the corridor, in the antechamber. Eight Guardian Deities adorn the antechamber.

Another notable figure is the Eleven-faced Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. It is on the back wall of the rotunda and stands 2.18 meters in height. This figure is the only one of the bas-reliefs facing forward; the others face the side. The Avalokitesvara wears a crown, is dressed in robes and jewelry and holds a vase containing a lotus blossom.

==Reconstruction==
Because of the long periods of abandonment and numerous renovations, many details are disputed amongst scholars, such as the exact layout of the original grotto, the buildings in Bulguksa or the shape of the watercourse, which no longer exists, in front of the temple.

Repair and improvements were undertaken in 1703 and 1758, during the Joseon period. However, Confucian-oriented rulers suppressed Buddhism, and the remote mountain grotto was seriously damaged by the turn of the 20th century. The Government-General of Chosen conducted restoration works three times, but faced humidity and other problems.

Japan did the first round of repairs from 1913 to 1915. These repairs were conducted without sufficient study of the structure of the grotto. During Japanese cleaning efforts, the structure of the grotto was almost completely dismantled and reassembled. A major mistake committed by the Japanese was their attempt to stabilize the structure by encasement in concrete, which was yet, the most advanced technology at the time. This resulted in humidity buildup and in water leaks, and caused erosion of the sculptures because the grotto could no longer &quot;breathe&quot;. In 1917, drainage pipes were buried above the dome to channel rainwater away from the grotto. However, as leaks continued in spite of the pipes, another round of repairs was conducted from 1920 to 1923. Waterproof asphalt was applied to the surface of the concrete, which only worsened the problem. Moss and mold formed, and in 1927 the now unthinkable method of spraying hot steam was used to clean the sculptures.

After World War II, in the 1960s, President Park Chung Hee ordered a major restoration project. The problem of temperature and humidity control was resolved to an extent by using mechanical systems. The wooden superstructure built over the antechamber remains a subject for debate for many historians who believe Seokguram originally did not have such a structure blocking the view of the sunrise over the ocean, and cutting off the air flow into the grotto.

The interior of the grotto can now only be viewed through a glass wall, installed to protect it from the many tourists it attracts, as well as temperature change.

<text>Garry Moore (born Thomas Garrison Morfit; January 31, 1915 – November 28, 1993) was an American entertainer, comedic personality, game show host, and humorist best known for his work in television. He began a long career with the CBS network starting in radio in 1937. Beginning in 1949 and through the mid-1970s, Moore was a television host on several variety and game shows.

After dropping out of high school, Moore found success first as a radio host and later moved to the medium of television. He hosted several daytime and prime time programs titled &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, and the game shows &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He was instrumental in furthering the career of comedic actress Carol Burnett. He became known early in his career for his bow ties and his crew cut fashion.

After being diagnosed with throat cancer in 1976, Moore retired from the broadcasting industry, making only a few rare television appearances. He spent the last years of his life in Hilton Head, South Carolina and at his summer home in Northeast Harbor in Maine. He died on November 28, 1993, at the age of 78.

==Early life and radio career==
Moore was born on January 31, 1915, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Mason P. Morfit and Mary L. (née Harris) Morfit. He attended The Baltimore City College (an all-boys, selective / specialized &quot;magnet&quot; public high school). Morfit / Moore&#x27;s alma mater was with a notable reputation (still in the 2020s) and the third oldest public secondary school in America, founded 1839). During his City College years he was very active in the extensive theater and drama / comedy / musical program&#x27;s and was often written about in the school&#x27;s publications. But he dropped out of the Class of 1933 before graduation to pursue a career in the relatively new radio medium and writing in the mid-1930s.

Decades later in 1971 he returned to his hometown for a nostalgic tour and reminiscing interviews in the other local daily paper &#x27;The Sun&#x27; for a Sunday magazine photo-spread and the City College student newspaper &#x27;The Collegian&#x27; plus being photoed in front of the landmark hilltop &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; stone cathedral-like structure of Collegiate Gothic architecture with 150-foot tall bells / clock tower, the prominent structure visible around for miles at the center of the B.C.C.&#x27;s large park-like campus on &quot;Collegian Hill&quot; He was elected to the alumni / faculty BCC Hall of Fame and still wore his gift Castle gold ring in his elder years. He attended at the Castle in its early classes, the fourth major structure / site in the school&#x27;s history, only two years after it opened in 1928, one of the most expensive school projects up to that time in America.

Beginning in 1937, Morfit worked for the then decade-old Baltimore radio station WBAL, owned by the Hearst Corporation and affiliated with NBC&#x27;s Red Network, as an announcer, writer and actor/comedian. He moved onto the network within a few years, becoming an announcer on the Red Network&#x27;s Chicago-based program &quot;Club Matinee&quot;. The show&#x27;s host, Ransom Sherman, held a contest to find a more easily pronounceable name for the young Baltimore announcer. &quot;Garry Moore&quot; was the winning entry, which was submitted by a woman from Pittsburgh who received a prize from the show of $100. So &quot;T. Garrison Morfit&quot; went into American broadcasting history forever after as &quot;Garry Moore&quot;.

It was on the &quot;Club Matinee&quot; program where he first met his long-time friend and broadcasting partner Durward Kirby.

Moore headed &quot;Talent, Ltd.&quot;, another variety program on Sunday afternoons in 1941. In the years that followed, Moore became more popular and requested, appearing on numerous network radio shows. Having started out as a local station announcer and then moved up as support for various nation-wide network radio broadcast personalities, one of whom was the famous comedian, singer and actor on film, radio and later TV, (with even a few record albums in elder years), with the distinctive nose, voice and worn face, Jimmy Durante (1893–1980).

For four years during the war-time and post-war era years 1943 to 1947, Durante and Moore started on their joint variety / comedy show &quot;The Durante-Moore Show&quot; with Moore as the &quot;straight man&quot; in the &quot;double / two-sided&quot; comedy act and Durante shelling out the jokes and one-liner jabs. Impressed with his ability to interact with audiences, the competing and older Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) offered him his own show on the new visual medium. Starting in 1949, the one-hour daytime variety show &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; began airing on the expanding CBS Television Network. Moore however briefly returned on-air to radio two decades later as host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; the long-running daily news / features program on NBC Radio News network in 1969.

==Television career==
Between 1947 and 1950, Moore began to make tentative steps into the new medium as a panelist and guest host on quiz and musical shows. On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program, &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, which was a shorter version of his radio show. Until September 1950, it was also simulcast on radio. During 1950 and 1951, he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for &quot;Arthur Godfrey and his Friends&quot;. He appeared as a guest star on other programs including CBS&#x27;s &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;.

During his run as a variety-show host, Moore was tapped to host CBS&#x27; weekly prime-time TV panel show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. It premiered on June 19, 1952. On this show, Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and panelist Bill Cullen, with whom he had a long working relationship. Morgan later stated that Moore had helped him keep his job as a television host.

Moore became known for his involvement in the variety of stunts and demonstrations of the show&#x27;s contestants. The popularity of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; led to a cameo in the 1959 film &quot;It Happened to Jane&quot;. In the film, Doris Day&#x27;s character was a contestant on the show, with Moore and all the panelists playing themselves.

Moore&#x27;s variety program was moved to the daytime slot, where it ran until June 27, 1958. Within three months of the end of the daytime show, Moore and his longtime colleague Durward Kirby moved the revived &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; into prime time as a Tuesday night comedy and variety hour that ran from September 30, 1958, to June 14, 1964. Although the show was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always preferred the daytime housewife audience. He thought it gave lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked.

&quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, as well as a mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, and Dorothy Loudon. The show also introduced the public to comedienne Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, from September 1967 through the spring of 1978.

During preparations for an episode of his variety show, Moore and his writing team knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be a good episode despite staying up late the night before to do rewrites. So, at the start of the show, Moore went out in front of the live audience and flat out told the audience as well as the audience at home that it wasn&#x27;t going to be a good show and recommended to the home viewing audience to tune in to what was airing on the rival networks that night. Every time a joke would bomb with the audience, Moore would turn to the camera and say, &quot;it&#x27;s your fault for still watching this!&quot; The home audience was so fascinated by the frank honesty of Moore that they stuck with the episode, and it was one of the highest-rated episodes of the season.

In 1961, during an episode with French magician Michel de la Vega, Garry Moore was tied up and placed into a trunk. Garry proved to be a very good assistant to the magician and the act went smoothly before the cameras. Audience reaction was so great and immediate that a repeat performance was scheduled. The second presentation brought an even greater flood of mail and telegrams praising the act. By popular demand, Michel was brought back to &quot;l&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; for the third time. In 1962, Moore was hypnotized live in &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret&quot; by Michel de la Vega. The French hypnotizer set Moore&#x27;s body stretched out over 2 chairs. Michel de la Vega then stood on top of Moore&#x27;s body showing how rigid it had become in a matter of minutes. It was the first performance of hypnosis on American television.

On the tenth anniversary broadcast of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, on June 19, 1962, Moore announced that he had recently had an operation on his right hand, and so that was why he was seen shaking hands with his left hand for a few months, protecting his hand from strong handshakes. On an episode of the show that September, guests Viola and Stephen Armstrong appeared with the secret that their son &quot;Neil&quot; had been selected as an astronaut by NASA that day. Speaking with the Armstrongs after the panel guessed their secret, Moore asked them &quot;How would you feel if it turns out, because nobody knows, that your son is the first man to land on the moon?&quot;

&quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; was cancelled in 1964, and in the summer of that year, after having been on radio and television for 27 uninterrupted years, Moore decided to retire, saying he had &quot;said everything [he] ever wanted to say three times already.&quot; He gave up hosting &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; and was replaced by comedian Steve Allen, who would host the show until the end of its run in 1967 (although Moore had ended his retirement before &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; left the air, he never returned to the series as host and Allen helmed a subsequent, one-season syndicated revival in 1972). Moore&#x27;s main activity during his hiatus was a trip around the world with his wife.

After an absence of two years, &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; returned to the CBS prime-time lineup in the fall of 1966. It was canceled mid-season because of low ratings against NBC&#x27;s highly rated western &quot;Bonanza.&quot; The successful &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; replaced &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; in the CBS time slot.

Moore then made sporadic television guest appearances such as cameos on Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In, reunions with Carol Burnett on her program, and serving as a panelist on various game shows, before Mark Goodson asked him to host another series. That show was a revival of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, which had ended its run on CBS in 1968. Moore was asked to host a revival of the series for syndication, which launched in September 1969. When &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; was planned to be revived for syndication, producers Mark Goodson and Bill Todman originally wanted Bud Collyer to host the show once again. But when they called Collyer he declined, citing his poor health.

When Goodson and Todman called Moore about the job, he immediately contacted Collyer, who told Moore, &quot;I am just not up to it.&quot; Moore often took part in the show&#x27;s silly and goofy stunts, as he had done on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, performing magic tricks and cooking. This led to this version of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;&#x27;s being compared to &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. Moore hosted the series from its premiere until the midway point of the 1976–77 season, the revival&#x27;s eighth.

==Recording==
In 1944, Moore recorded six of his radio monologues for Decca, including his classic “Hugh, the Blue Gnu”, his triple-time speed reading of “Little Red Riding Hood”, and a calamity-filled version of “In the Good Old Summertime”. They were released two years later as Decca 444, an album of three 78rpm records titled “Culture Corner”. In 1956, Moore recorded a Columbia LP record album for children. It featured tales by Rudyard Kipling, including &quot;The Elephant&#x27;s Child&quot; and &quot;How the Camel Got His Hump.&quot; Also in 1956, Moore recorded a Columbia LP record album titled &quot;Garry Moore Presents My Kind Of Music,&quot; with contributions by jazz musicians George Barnes, Ernie Caceres, Wild Bill Davison, Randy Hall, Mel Henke, and Sonny Terry. In 1965, he also narrated two children&#x27;s classics for orchestra back-to-back on a single Westminster LP, Saint-Saens&#x27; &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot; and Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;.

==Retirement and death==
Moore became ill in 1976 and was diagnosed with throat cancer. He left &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; shortly before Christmas 1976 to undergo surgery, turning the show over to panelist Bill Cullen. Semiregular panelist Joe Garagiola also acted as the host for several weeks, claiming he was &quot;pinch-hitting&quot; for Moore.

Moore returned in September 1977 to begin &quot;To Tell the Truth&#x27;s&quot; ninth season, to explain his sudden absence and to announce his permanent retirement, explaining that while recovering from his surgery, he believed his throat cancer was a sign that continuing beyond his 42-year career would be &quot;just plain greed&quot;. Moore later explained in another interview that he felt comfortable moving on from the world of entertainment. Joe Garagiola hosted the program for the rest of the season, which proved to be its last. After his showbiz retirement, Moore kept getting various offers for more work that he continued to turn down, including frequent phone calls from the producers of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

Moore retired to Hilton Head, South Carolina, where he spent his time sailing, and also at his summer home in Northeast Harbor, Maine. Moore also became a regular humor columnist for the local newspaper &quot;The Island Packet&quot; with a column titled &quot;Mumble, Mumble&quot;, later releasing a book of his columns under the same name in the early 1980s. He made two rare television appearances during his retirement, in a 1984 special on game-show bloopers, hosted by William Shatner, and in a 1990 television tribute to Carol Burnett on &quot;Sally&quot;.

Moore, a constant smoker, died of emphysema at Hilton Head on November 28, 1993, at the age of 78. He was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in Northeast Harbor, Maine. He was named one of the 15 greatest game-show hosts of all time by &quot;Time&quot;.

<text>Paul Fussell Jr. (22 March 1924 – 23 May 2012) was an American cultural and literary historian, author and university professor. His writings cover a variety of topics, from scholarly works on eighteenth-century English literature to commentary on America&#x27;s class system. Fussell served in the 103rd Infantry Division during World War II and was wounded in fighting in France. Returning to the US, Fussell wrote extensively and held several faculty positions, most prominently at Rutgers University (1955–1983) and at the University of Pennsylvania (1983–1994). He is best known for his writings about World War I and II, which explore what he felt was the gap between the romantic myth and the reality of war; he made a &quot;career out of refusing to disguise it or elevate it&quot;.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Pasadena, California, Fussell was the second of three children. His father, Paul Fussell (1895–1973), son of a widowed schoolteacher, became a corporate lawyer in Los Angeles with the firm of O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers, and served as President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association in 1947. His mother, Wilhma Wilson Sill (1893–1971), was the daughter of a carriage trimmer in Illinois. His brother, Edwin Sill Fussell, was an author, poet, and professor of American Studies at the University of California, San Diego; his sister Florence Fussell Lind lives in Berkeley, California.

His daughter, Rosalind, is an artist-teacher in Arizona and the author of a graphic novel, &quot;Mammoir: A Pictorial Odyssey of the Adventures of a Fourth Grade Teacher with Breast Cancer&quot;. His son, Samuel Wilson Fussell, a writer and hunter in Montana, is the author of &quot;Muscle: Confessions of an Unlikely Bodybuilder&quot;.

Starting in 1941, Fussell attended Pomona College until he enlisted in the United States Army in September 1942 and was commissioned as an officer the next year. He landed in France in fall 1944 as a 20-year-old second lieutenant with the 103rd Infantry Division, was wounded while fighting in Alsace, and was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Following the end of the war in Europe, Fussell returned to the United States where he was assigned to the 45th Infantry Division, which was preparing for the anticipated Allied invasion of Japan. Fussell&#x27;s recollections of hearing the news of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, while waiting stateside to deploy would later form the basis of his essay &quot;Thank God for the Atom Bomb&quot;.

He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1946, returned to Pomona to finish his B.A. degree in 1946–1947, married fellow Pomona graduate Betty Harper in 1949, and completed his MA (1949) and PhD (1952) at Harvard University.

He began his teaching career at Connecticut College (1951–55) before moving to Rutgers University in 1955 and finally the University of Pennsylvania in 1983. He also taught at the University of Heidelberg (1957–58) and King&#x27;s College London (1990–92). As a professor, he travelled widely with his family throughout Europe from the 1950s to &#x27;70s, taking Fulbright and sabbatical years in Germany, England and France.

Betty Fussell has described their marriage and its breakup in 1981 in her memoir, &quot;My Kitchen Wars&quot;. After Fussell moved from his home in Princeton, New Jersey, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he divorced Betty and married Harriette Behringer. He retired from the University of Pennsylvania in 1994 and lived with his wife in Oregon.

==Writing and teaching career==

When he first entered college, Fussell intended a career in journalism. His plans changed when his sergeant was killed beside him in combat, about which he wrote in his memoir &quot;Doing Battle&quot; (1996). In his writings he opposed war, promoting instead a vision of rational enlightenment. He pointed to what he saw as the hypocrisy of governmental speech and the corruption of popular culture.

His published thesis, &quot;Theory of Prosody in Eighteenth-Century England&quot;, was developed into &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form&quot; (1965), a popular textbook for understanding poetry. &quot;Samuel Johnson and The Life of Writing&quot; (1971) offered an analysis of the work of the English lexicographer, Samuel Johnson. &quot;The Anti-Egotist, Kingsley Amis: Man of Letters&quot; was a study of the life and work of friend and colleague, Kingsley Amis.

The award-winning &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (1975) was a cultural and literary analysis of the impact of World War I on the development of modern literature and modern literary conventions. John Keegan said its effect was &quot;revolutionary&quot;, in that it showed how literature could be a vehicle for expressing the experience of large groups. &quot;What Paul did was go to the literary treatments of the war by 20 or 30 participants and turn them into an encapsulation of a collective European experience&quot;. (John Keegan) Joseph Heller called it &quot;the best book I know of about world war one&quot;. However, a number of modern historians have criticised Fussell&#x27;s treatment of the war as deeply flawed with significant factual errors and tendentious conclusions. 

&quot;Abroad: British Literary Travelling Between the Wars&quot; (1980) was a pioneering academic examination of travel literature which examined the travel books of Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Byron.

Fussell stated that he relished the inevitable controversy of &quot;&quot; (1983) and indulged his increasing public status as a loved or hated &quot;curmudgeon&quot; in the rant called &quot;BAD: or, The Dumbing of America&quot; (1991). In between, &quot;Thank God for the Atom Bomb and Other Essays&quot; (1988) confirmed his war against governmental and military doublespeak and prepared the way for &quot;Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War&quot; (1989). The epiphany of his earlier essay, &quot;My War&quot;, found full expression in his memoir &quot;Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic&quot; (1996), &quot;My Adolescent illusions, largely intact to that moment, fell away all at once, and I suddenly knew I was not and never would be in a world that was reasonable or just&quot;. The last book by Fussell published while he was alive, &quot;The Boys&#x27; Crusade: The American Infantry in Northwestern Europe, 1944–45&quot; (2003) was once again concerned with the experience of combat in World War II.

==Awards and honors==
Fussell&#x27;s 1975 literary study &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot; won the National Book Award in category Arts and Letters, the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism, and the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award of Phi Beta Kappa. It was ranked number 75 in the Modern Library&#x27;s Board&#x27;s List of the 100 Best Nonfiction Books of the Twentieth Century.

He was elected in 1977 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

He won the 2005 Hessell-Tiltman Prize for &quot;The Boys&#x27; Crusade&quot;. Fussell was one of several veterans interviewed in the Ken Burns and Lynn Novick documentary &quot;The War&quot; in 2007, and in the 1999 ABC-produced documentary &quot;The Century: America&#x27;s Time&quot;.

==Death==

Fussell died of natural causes on 23 May 2012, at a long-term care facility in Medford, Oregon. He had previously lived in Portland, Oregon, for two years. He was 88.

<text>Ross Winn (August 25, 1871 – August 8, 1912) was an American anarchist writer and publisher from Texas who was mostly active within the Southern United States.

== Biography ==
Ross Winn was born in Denton County, Texas in 1871. Prior to beginning his own publishing efforts, Winn frequently wrote articles for other radical papers. Winn&#x27;s earliest known published writing appears in the January, 1894 issue of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;. He was 23 when he wrote the piece, a plea for cooperation between socialists and anarchists. In a later piece, appearing in &quot;Free Society&quot; in December, 1900, Winn mentions becoming a &quot;young convert&quot; in realizing his own radical political notions twelve years earlier, when he was only 17 years old. It is likely that Winn, like many other anarchists of the time, became politicized by the execution of the Haymarket martyrs. Winn also wrote articles for &quot;Discontent: Mother of Progress&quot; from Home, Washington, &quot;The Firebrand&quot;, a short-lived, but renowned weekly out of Portland, Oregon; &quot;The Rebel&quot;, an anarchist journal published in Boston; and Emma Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Mother Earth&quot;.

Sometime in 1894, Winn began his first paper, known as &quot;Co-operative Commonwealth&quot;. He then edited and published &quot;Coming Era&quot; for a brief time in 1898 and then &quot;Winn&#x27;s Freelance&quot; in 1899. Later in 1899, Winn took over publication of &quot;Free Society&quot; and discontinued &quot;Coming Era&quot; and &quot;Winn&#x27;s Freelance&quot;. In 1902, he announced a new paper called &quot;Winn&#x27;s Firebrand&quot;. It&#x27;s likely he fancied the name of the then-defunct weekly. His vision was for a paper that would appeal to people of all classes. According to Winn, it would be &quot;just the kind of literature for missionary work among the masses&quot;. Winn considered the printed word as the most effective tool for social awakening, and saw the dissemination of anti-authoritarian ideals, especially in the conservative South, as his distinct calling. In 1900, Tennessee became his base of operation: &quot;In establishing the magazine (in Mt. Juliet), as an independent publication, the flag of revolutionary thought is planted on Southern soil, and a residence of a lifetime in this section convinces me that it will be a fruitful field for libertarian ideas, if the right methods are used to present them.&quot; Winn and his future wife Augusta &quot;Gussie&quot; Smith moved into her family home in Mt. Juliet, the Warner Price Mumford Smith House. 

In 1899, Winn married Augusta Smith, and they soon had their first and only child, Ross Winn, Jr. In 1901, Winn met Emma Goldman in Chicago, and found in her a lasting ally. As she wrote in his obituary, Emma &quot;was deeply impressed with his fervor and complete abandonment to the cause, so unlike most American revolutionists, who love their ease and comfort too well to risk them for their ideals.&quot; Winn kept up a correspondence with Goldman throughout his life, as he did with other prominent anarchist writers at the time. Joseph Labadie, a prominent writer and organizer in Michigan, was another friend to Winn, and contributed several pieces to &quot;Winn&#x27;s Firebrand&quot; in its later years.

Sometime in 1909, Ross Winn contracted tuberculosis (then known as &quot;consumption&quot;), but continued his work on &quot;Firebrand&quot; despite his failing health. In 1910, he moved briefly to Texas with his wife, Augusta (known as &quot;Gussie&quot;), in search of work. Unable to find work, and having gotten himself deeper into debt, Winn sold his printing setup and moved back to Mt. Juliet.

In July 1911, Gussie wrote a letter, in secret, to Emma Goldman asking for any possible financial assistance from their allies, knowing that her husband &quot;would rather starve than to beg&quot;. Word was sent out around the country and, all told, some $60 was raised, quite a sum for a small family at that time. Rather than spending the money on himself or his family, however, Winn spent the majority of the money on a new printing setup and began what was to be his last paper, known as &quot;The Advance&quot;. On August 8, 1912, the degenerative infection of tuberculosis finally took Winn&#x27;s life. He was still setting type on the August issue of &quot;The Advance&quot; the day before he died.

<text>Basil Konstantine Poledouris (; August 21, 1945 – November 8, 2006) was an American composer, conductor, and orchestrator of film and television scores, best known for his long-running collaborations with directors John Milius and Paul Verhoeven. Among his works are scores for the films &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), &quot;Iron Eagle&quot; (1986), &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987), &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), &quot;Free Willy&quot; (1993), &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1997) and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1998).

Poledouris won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special for his work on the four-part miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; in 1989, and was a four-time recipient of the BMI Film Music Award.

==Life and career==

Born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Greek immigrant parents from Messenia, he credited two influences with guiding him towards music: the first was composer Miklós Rózsa; the second his own Greek Orthodox heritage. Poledouris was raised in the Church, and he used to sit in services enthralled by the choir&#x27;s sound. At the age of seven, Poledouris began piano lessons, and after graduation from Garden Grove High School, he enrolled at the University of Southern California to study both filmmaking and music. Several short films to which he contributed are still kept in the university&#x27;s archives. At USC, Poledouris met movie directors John Milius and Randal Kleiser, with whom he would later collaborate as a music composer. He appeared as a background extra in several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. In 1985, Poledouris wrote the music for Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;, establishing a durable collaboration.

Poledouris became renowned for his powerfully epic style of orchestral composition and his intricate thematic designs. He scored the soundtrack for &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; (1980; dir: Kleiser); &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982; dir: Milius); &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984); &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984; dir: Milius), &quot;Iron Eagle&quot; (1986); &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987; dir: Verhoeven); &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990); &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot; (1990 Simon Wincer); &quot;Free Willy&quot; (1993) and its first sequel &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot; (1995); &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1997; dir: Verhoeven); and &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; (1999).

Poledouris&#x27; studio, &quot;Blowtorch Flats&quot;, was located in Venice, California, and was a professional mixing facility specializing in film and media production.

Poledouris married his wife Bobbie in 1969; they had two daughters, Zoë and Alexis. His elder daughter, Zoë Poledouris, is an actress and film composer, who occasionally collaborated with her father in composing film soundtracks.

In 1996, Poledouris composed &quot;The Tradition of the Games&quot; for the Atlanta Olympics opening ceremony that accompanied the memorable dance tribute to the athletes and goddesses of victory of the ancient Greek Olympics using silhouette imagery.

Poledouris spent the last four years of his life residing on Vashon Island, in Washington state. He died on November 8, 2006, in Los Angeles, California, aged 61, from lung cancer.

<text>The United Nations World Summit for Children was held in the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on 29–30 September 1990. The summit had the then-largest-ever gathering of heads of state and government to commit to a set of goals to improve the well-being of children worldwide by the year 2000. It was the first time a UN conference had set a broad agenda for a wide range of goals in health, education, nutrition and human rights. 

The main result of the World Summit was the joint signing of a World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and a Plan of Action comprising a detailed set of child-related human development goals for the year 2000. The World Summit set the stage for a decade of high level commitment on issues concerning children around the world and it set the stage for a series of UN conferences throughout the 1990s on population, environment, food, human rights, social development and women&#x27;s rights.

== Origin of project ==
The Summit was proposed in 1989 by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, President Moussa Traoré of Mali, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, and Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden. These six leaders worked together &quot;to bring attention and promote commitment, at the highest political level, to goals and strategies for ensuring the survival, protection and development of children as key elements in the socio-economic development of all countries and human society&quot;. The United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar adopted the project and gave the Summit the support of the UNICEF and other UN organizations. A total 159 governments were invited to the event. In attendance were heads of state from 72 different countries, as well as representatives from 87 other nations. 

The Summit agenda was highly endorsed by three main organizations- the World Health Assembly, Education for All (led by UNESCO) and the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Board. UNICEF was the main contributor. Every year following the Summit, it conducted progress reports on the implementation of Summit goals and released them through its many publications.

The World Summit for Children was held at a moment when the world was just beginning to demonstrate united interest in children&#x27;s survival and development. A year prior the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted. It is a human rights treaty focused directly on the rights of children. The document had entered into force just a couple of weeks before the Summit was held.

== Goals established ==
There were 27 total goals established. The main objective was to improve child health and survival. The goals can be divided into six categories: health, survival, women&#x27;s health, nutrition, education and protection. These goals were put into action from 1990-2000. After the ten-year period, world leaders would meet again to review the progress made during the decade.

=== Health ===
There were nine health goals established. 
# Polio: global eradication by 2000 
# Neonatal tetanus: elimination by 1995 
# Deaths due to diarrhoea: 50 percent reduction 
# Vitamin A deficiency: virtual elimination by the year 2000 
# Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD): virtual elimination
# Elimination of guinea-worm disease (Dracunculiasis) by 2000
# Measles: reduction by 95 percent in measles deaths and 90 percent of measles cases by 1995
# Anemia: reduction of iron deficiency Anemia in women by one-third 
# Routine immunization: maintenance of a high level of immunization coverage

=== Survival ===

# Infant and under-5 mortality (U5MR): reduction by one third in infant mortality and U5MR 
# Household food security: dissemination of knowledge and supporting services to increase food production 
# Acute respiratory infections (Influenza-like illness): reduction of ARI deaths by one third in children under five

=== Women&#x27;s health ===
# Childbirth care: access by all pregnant women to prenatal care
# Breastfeeding: empowerment of all women to breastfeed their children exclusively for four to six months and to continue breastfeeding, with complementary food, well into the second year of life
# Childbirth care: access by all pregnant women to referral facilities for high-risk pregnancies and obstetric emergencies
# Special attention to the health and nutrition of the female child and to pregnant and lactating women
# Maternal mortality: reduction of the rate by half
# Low birth-weight: reduction of the rate of low birth-weight to less than 10 percent
=== Nutrition ===
# Malnutrition: reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition among under-five children by half
# Water: universal access to safe drinking water

=== Education ===
# Family planning: access by all couples to information and services to prevent pregnancies that are too early, too closely spaced, too late, or too numerous 
# Knowledge skills and values required for better living: increased acquisition by individuals and families of knowledge, skills and values for better living
# Universal access to basic education: achievement of primary education by at least 80% of primary school-age children 
# Universal access to education with an emphasis on primary education for girls and literacy training for women
# Early childhood development (ECD): expansion of ECD activities, including appropriate low-cost family and community-based interventions

=== Protection ===
# Improve protection of children in extremely difficult circumstances 
# Growth monitoring: growth promotion and regular growth monitoring among children to be institutionalized in all countries by the end of the 1990s

== Laws established ==
The high point of the Summit was the joint signing of the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children and a Plan of Action on September 30, 1990. The World Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children served as a written commitment to children worldwide. It summarizes the reason for the Summit and the goals established. The Plan of Action is a supplement to the World Declaration. It outlines how goals are to be met.

=== World declaration ===
The World Declaration of the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children is subdivided into five categories: The Challenge, The Opportunity, The Task, The Commitment, and The Next Step. 
* The Challenge: To help countless children around the world who are exposed to dangers that hamper their growth and development. In particular those that are victims of poverty, malnutrition, war, and disease.
* The Opportunity: Declares that the fulfillment of the Summit goals will be an international co-operation, and leaders worldwide must implement the obligations agreed upon to on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed in 1989; it was the first international treaty to guarantee civil and political rights as well as economic, social, and cultural rights. The United States and South Sudan are the only countries who have not ratified the Convention. 
* The Task and The Commitment: Both of these serve to further explain the specific goals of the Summit.
** Improve Children&#x27;s Health
** Improve Prenatal Health
** To strengthen the role and status of women 
** To provide educational opportunities
** To ameliorate the lives of homeless, refugee, disabled, and abused children 
** To protect children from the dangers of war
** To work for a global attack on poverty
* The Next Step: The adoption of The Plan of Action to specify how the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children will be realized.

=== Plan of action ===
The Plan of Action is a framework for more specific national and international undertakings. It addresses every goal individually to ensure the implementation of the Declaration of the World Summit for Children. It also concentrates on the follow-up and monitoring of the progression towards accomplishing each goal. The primary responsibility for the implementation of all goals was given to National Governments. Each country agreed to develop strategies through National Programs of Action to make sure these 27 global goals could become national realities. A total of 155 countries developed National Programs of Action.

== Special session ==
The Special Session on Children was a meeting the UN General Assembly held May 8–10, 2002. It was held to review the progress made for children in the decade since the 1990 World Summit for Children. It also served as a method to renew the commitments made in 1990, and to make a pledge for specific actions for the coming decade. In total about 70 Heads of State and/or Government attended the Session. Children from all around the world where invited to attend. They participated in numerous supporting events. One of the more important events was the Celebration of Leadership for Children held on May 9. The event encompassed a sense of unity and created a festive nature for the Session, but the real reason for the gathering was not forgotten.

The World Summit stands out from any other United Nations gathering because of its soundly set goals and its systematic follow up procedure. The Secretary-General’s report on children, titled &quot;We the Children&quot; uses data taken from 135 countries and is based on reviews conducted at the national level. It was the most comprehensive study of what was happening to the world’s children at that time. &quot;We the Children&quot; is a statistical representation of the minimal progress made in the decade. The report states, “The world has fallen short of achieving most of the goals of the World Summit for Children&quot;. Few of the goals established could be labeled as successes, others showed progress, but the majority were not met.

===Success===
* Polio: global eradication by 2000 
* Neonatal tetanus: elimination by 1995 
* Deaths due to diarrhea: 50 percent reduction
* Vitamin A deficiency: virtual elimination by the year 2000
* Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD): virtual elimination
* Elimination of guinea-worm disease(Dracunculiasis) by 2000

===Some progress===
* Infant and under-5 mortality: reduction by one third in infant mortality and Under-5 mortality
* Measles: reduction by 95 percent in measles deaths and 90 percent of measles cases by 1995 as a major step to global eradication
* Malnutrition: reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition among under-five children by half
* Breastfeeding: empowerment of all women to breastfeed their children exclusively for four to six months and to continue breastfeeding, with complementary food, well into the second year of life
* Low birth-weight: reduction of the rate of low birth-weight to less than 10%
* Family planning: access by all couples to information and services to prevent pregnancies that are too early, too closely spaced, too late or too numerous
* Childbirth care: access by all pregnant women to prenatal care
* Water: universal access to safe drinking water
* Universal access to basic education: achievement of primary education by at least 80% of primary school-age children
* Universal access to education with an emphasis on primary education for girls and literacy training for women
* Early childhood development (ECD): expansion of ECD activities, including appropriate low-cost family and community-based interventions 
* Improve protection of children in extremely difficult circumstances

===No progress===
* Routine immunization: maintenance of a high level of immunization coverage
* Maternal mortality: reduction of the rate by half
* Anemia: reduction of iron deficiency Anemia in women by one-third

===Limited data===
* &quot;There was limited or inconclusive data on the remaining 6 goals&quot;

&quot;We the Children&quot; places the blame to meet goals on financial barriers. Critics note that in many United Nations conferences, goals are ever set but never met, and that commitments on paper are rarely translated into actions. The Canadian Medical Association Journal attributes the lack of progress to the fact that documents emerging from UN conferences are policy documents rather than legal instruments or binding treaties, but it also remarks that the Special Session on Children will set the direction for international policy with respect to children for the next decade.

<text>Spy was a satirical monthly magazine published from 1986 to 1998. Based in New York City, the magazine was founded by Kurt Andersen and E. Graydon Carter, who served as its first editors, and Thomas L. Phillips Jr., its first publisher. &quot;Spy&quot; specialized in irreverent and satirical pieces targeting the American media and entertainment industries and mocking high society.

==Overview==
Some of its features attempted to present the darker side of celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, John F. Kennedy Jr., Steven Seagal, Martha Stewart, and especially the real-estate tycoon Donald Trump and his then-wife Ivana Trump. Pejorative epithets of celebrities, such as &quot;Abe &#x27;I&#x27;m Writing As Bad As I Can&#x27; Rosenthal&quot;, &quot;short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump&quot;, &quot;churlish dwarf billionaire Laurence Tisch&quot;, &quot;antique Republican pen-holder Bob Dole&quot;, &quot;dynastic misstep La Toya Jackson&quot;, &quot;bum-kissing toady Arthur Gelb&quot;, &quot;bosomy dirty-book writer Shirley Lord&quot;, and &quot;former fat girl Dianne Brill&quot; became a &quot;Spy&quot; trademark. In the summer of 1992, the publication ran a story on President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s alleged extramarital affairs. The following year, it ran an article entitled &quot;Clinton&#x27;s First 100 Lies&quot;, detailing what it described as the new president&#x27;s pattern of duplicitous behavior.

In March 1989, &quot;Spy&quot; published &quot;The Pickup Artist&#x27;s Guide to Picking Up Women: A Case-by-Case Look at Movie Director James Toback&#x27;s Street Technique.&quot; It was written by Vincenza Demetz and included accounts from thirteen women—including the author—who accused Toback of sexual misconduct.

Spy was acquired in 1991 by Jean-Christophe Pigozzi and Charles Saatchi. In early 1994, the magazine, which was losing money and couldn&#x27;t find a buyer, was forced to suspend publication. It was saved by Sussex Publishers Inc., the publishers of &quot;Psychology Today&quot; and &quot;Mother Earth News&quot;, resuming publication with the July-August 1994 issue.

The magazine ceased publication in 1998.

==Features==
Introduced in the May 1987 issue, &quot;Private Lives of Public Enemies&quot; (renamed &quot;Private Lives of Public Figures&quot;, then simply &quot;Private Lives&quot; in 1989) presented fictional representations of public personalities in unflattering situations.

&quot;Separated at Birth?&quot;, first presented in a feature article in December 1987, was a regular section which would present juxtaposed photos of two different personalities exhibiting visual similarity, to comical effect. The first of each pair was typically a public figure or celebrity, and the second was usually another such figure, but sometimes (usually in the last set) a more absurd subject such as a fictional character, animal, or inanimate object. &quot;Separated at Birth?&quot; became one of the magazine&#x27;s most popular features and was spun out into a set of paperback books.

==Legacy==
In 1990, NBC aired a TV special &quot;Spy Magazine Presents How to Be Famous&quot; hosted by Jerry Seinfeld and featuring Victoria Jackson and Harry Shearer satirizing American celebrity culture.

In October 2006, Miramax Books published &quot;Spy: The Funny Years&quot; (), a greatest-hits anthology and history of the magazine created and compiled by Carter, Andersen, and one of their original editors, George Kalogerakis.

In January 2015, after the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo, Donald Trump made a series of tweets attacking both &quot;Spy&quot; and &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, calling &quot;Spy&quot; a &quot;rag magazine.&quot;

In October 2016, &quot;Esquire&quot; produced a special online version of &quot;Spy&quot; during the last thirty days of the presidential campaign.

<doc id="645285" wikidata="Q1027184" url="?curid=645285" title="Callback (telecommunications)">
<text>In telecommunications, a callback or call-back occurs when the originator of a call is immediately called back in a second call as a response.

== International calling ==
A callback, in this sense is a method of making low-cost international calls via a third country, usually the United States, where call charges are considerably lower. One variation of this technology was developed by IDT Corporation in 1991. IDT Corp used a hardware solution that was never widely accepted and ultimately failed and was surpassed by a software solution concurrently developed by Jorge Blanco at MCI Telecommunications for The United Nations Development Programme and their staff Wolfgang Scholtes and Kumar Navaratnum.

In order to use a callback service, a subscriber is allocated a unique number in, for example, the US, which must first be dialled in order to trigger a return call. This is known (in the US) as a Direct Inbound Dialing (DID) number, or in the UK as a Direct Dial-In (DDI) number. Where Caller ID is available, it may be possible to use the same DID number for many different subscribers, as the callback system will be able to recognise each subscriber&#x27;s registered number.

On hearing a ringing tone, the subscriber simply hangs up and awaits the callback. On receiving this, usually within a few seconds, the customer picks up the phone and dials the required number. This may mean dialling in the North American format, as most callback services are US-based, and callers are effectively calling from the US. For example, a number in Manhattan would be dialled with the trunk code, area code and subscriber&#x27;s number, as follows:

 1 212 xxx xxxx

A call to London in the UK, would require the international access code and country calling code, as follows:

 011 44 20 xxxx xxxx

In the North American Numbering Plan, 011 is used as the international access code, but in most countries, 00 is used, in line with International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s Recommendation E.164.

The cost of making a telephone call via callback consists of two parts, as the caller is effectively paying for an outbound and inbound call at the same time. For example, if a customer from Spain is calling a phone number in Australia, and it costs 8 cents per minute to phone Spain from the US (the callback, which is an incoming call) and 20 cents per minute to phone Australia from the US (the destination call, which is an outgoing call), then the caller will pay a total of 28 US cents a minute. This may still be less expensive than calling directly from Spain to Australia, which is primarily why callbacks are used.

== Automated applications ==

Callback is often automated through the use of web callback or mobile phone applications by companies such as GlobalTel and Jajah, or on Roaming SIMs.

=== Legal status of callback ===

Many countries have banned callback services, on the grounds that they are not licensed or regulated by their governments, and deprive telephone companies in many developing countries of revenue from international calls. People who provide or use callback services have argued that these telephone companies are often state monopolies that charge unjustifiably high prices for international calls. It may also be the only way of making calls to certain countries from others, for example, Israel from other Middle Eastern countries.

Other countries have sought to use technical means to prevent callback, by blocking the inbound and outbound calls made to and from DID numbers, or by disabling touch tone dialing. However, this is also overcome by the use of speed dial numbers, while others use these services by triggering callback via the Internet or SMS.

The use of callback in most developed countries has declined, owing to the liberalization of telecommunication services, which allow more direct access to low-cost international calls, without the need for a time-consuming process like callback. Also, the advent of Voice over Internet Protocol services has allowed many people to make international calls via their computer connected to the Internet, although sound quality can be poorer on slower dial-up connections than on broadband ones.

International callback has been credited with opening global telecom markets because it enabled competition to start up even if regulatory restrictions existed. It was popularized by a 1994 book, &quot;The International CallBack Book&quot; by Gene Retske.

== Modem security ==

A modem allows one computer (the client) to establish a connection to another (the server) by dialing the server&#x27;s telephone number. This is sometimes viewed as being insecure because there is no authentication of the call originator. One way to increase security is to enforce a modem callback protocol, which usually proceeds as a series of steps:

# The client computer calls the server computer.
# After a greeting the client identifies itself, usually with a user name.
# The server then disconnects the call.
# Based upon the user name and a list of users&#x27; phone numbers, the server will then establish a second call back to the client computer.
# The client computer, expecting this returned call, will then answer and communications between the two computers will proceed normally.

Sometimes callback modem setups can also be used for billback purposes, allowing the originator to avoid lengthy toll charges.

<doc id="645287" wikidata="Q4668476" url="?curid=645287" title="Abortion in New Zealand">
<text>Abortion in New Zealand is available within the framework of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, which entirely eliminated the criminal status of abortion and allows termination on request during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. After 20 weeks abortion is permitted only if a health practitioner deems it &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; and consults at least one other health practitioner. However, the law does not specify what the conditions are which constitute &quot;clinically appropriate&quot;, and there are no criminal penalties. Abortion is illegal only if a person who is not a licensed health practitioner procures or performs it. 

Before 2020, abortion in New Zealand was heavily restricted and criminalised under the Crimes Act 1961, with significant changes occurring in 1977 and 1978 to allow abortions under specific circumstances, although subsequent High Court and Court of Appeal decisions liberalised abortion access within that context, particularly &quot;Wall v Livingston&quot; in 1982. In March 2022, New Zealand implemented explicit &quot;safe access zones&quot; by legislation around abortion clinics and/or hospitals.

==Current legislation==

Abortion in New Zealand is regulated by four laws: the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 (CS&amp;A Act 1977), the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003, and Section 38 of the Care of Children Act 2004. A woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant may seek abortion from a health practitioner. A woman seeking an abortion past 20 weeks must obtain approval from a health practitioner, who decides whether the procedure is &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; and consults with at least one other qualified practitioner. Prior to 24 March 2020, women in New Zealand could only seek an abortion after consulting two health practitioners.

===Abortion Legislation Act 2020===
The Abortion Legislation Act 2020 amends two existing laws: the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 and the Crimes Act 1961. While the Abortion Legislation Act&#x27;s initially introduced safe zones around abortion providers, it was eliminated from the final version of the law.

*Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977: It replaces Sections 10 to 46 of the CS&amp;A Act 1977 with Sections 10–14 and Sections 19–21. The amended bill also abolishes the Abortion Supervisory Committee, the former regulatory body that reported to Parliament, and gives its former responsibilities to the Minister of Health and the Director-General of Health.
**Section 10: A qualified health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant.
**Section 11: After 20 weeks, a health practitioner can only provide abortion services to a woman if it is deemed clinically appropriate and if they consult at least one other qualified practitioner.
**Section 13: A health practitioner must advise a woman of the availability of counselling services if the woman seeks advice on whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy; advises the health practitioner of her intention to terminate the pregnancy; or has terminated pregnancy. 
**Section 14: A health practitioner cannot coerce a woman into seeking counselling as a condition for procuring an abortion.
**Section 19: A health practitioner with a conscientious objection to abortion must inform the patient and provide them with information on accessing alternative abortion providers.
**Section 20: Employer providing certain services must accommodate conscientious objection of applicant or employee unless it would cause unreasonable disruption. Abortion is regulated by the Ministry of Health and the Director-General of Health, which oversee the collection and publication of information relating to abortion services and providers. Section 20F states that the New Zealand Parliament opposes abortion for the sole purpose of sex-selection, but does not prohibit the practice. 
**Section 21: The Governor-General has the authority to direct the Director-General of Health to collection information relating to the regulation of abortion services stated in Section 20.
*Crimes Act 1961: Abortion is eliminated from the Crimes Act. The Abortion Legislation Act replaces Sections 182A to 187A with Section 183, which states that abortion is only an offense if a person who is not a health practitioner procures or performs an abortion on a woman. The woman is not guilty of the offense.

===Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003===
This allows for conscientious objection by medical professionals.

===Care of Children Act 2004===
Section 38 of the Care of Children Act 2004 allows a young woman under the age of 16 to consent to an abortion but that she must still go through the process outlined in the CS&amp;A Act 1977.

==History==
===19th century and early 20th century===
English law, applied in New Zealand in 1840, outlawed abortion. In 1867, the New Zealand Parliament made it an offence to cause a miscarriage. Under the law, abortionists were considered criminals while the woman seeking an abortion was considered an accomplice to the crime. If a woman induced her own abortion, she was considered a criminal under the law. Therapeutic abortions were available under limited circumstances such as when the woman&#x27;s life or mental health was in serious danger. During the late 1930s, this right was extended by a court judgment. However, abortion was still strongly frowned upon by society with many doctors refusing to perform terminations.

In 1936 the First Labour Government of New Zealand set up a committee, led by D.G. McMillan, to inquire about the incidence of septic abortion in New Zealand. The report estimated that at least 13 in every 100 pregnancies ended in criminal abortion, that number having increased over the five years prior. In the same time period, while maternal deaths had dropped, the number of deaths due to septic abortions had increased, accounting for two-fifths of total maternal mortality. Based on evidence heard before the committee, it was found that a major reason for abortions was a change in social outlook, &quot;particularly towards the rearing of large families&quot; and &quot;an attitude of pitying superiority towards the woman with many children.&quot; Other reasons included lack of suitable housing in cities, lack of help for women in performing domestic labour, and the widespread use of ineffective methods of contraception.

In the 1930s, Isabel Annie Aves was tried four times for &quot;unlawfully using an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage&quot; without conviction. In the 1940s, activists such as Alice Bush advocated for access to doctor-provided abortions.

===Changing attitudes, 1960s–1970s ===
Following the Second World War, the Sexual Revolution during the 1960s led a change in societal attitudes towards matters of sex, birth control, and motherhood including abortion. These also gave rise to the emergence of Second-wave feminism and the Women&#x27;s liberation movement during the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1965 and 1970, the number of abortions performed in public hospitals jumped from 70 in 1965 to more than 300 by 1970. Public debate increased following the legalisation of abortion in Britain in 1967, and court decisions in Australia in 1967 and 1970 legalising abortion. The legalisation of abortion in Australia enabled New Zealand women who could afford to travel there to have abortions in Australia.

Growing public awareness and debate about abortion led to the emergence of rival anti-abortion and abortion rights groups. Early anti-abortion groups included the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Children (SPUC) and REPEAL while early abortion rights groups included the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand (ALRANZ) and the more militant Women&#x27;s National Abortion Action Campaign (WONAAC). According to McCulloch, several Socialist Action League members including Kay Goodger were involved in the formation of WONAAC.

During the 1970s, the Catholic Church, conservative Protestant denominations, and the Mormons opposed abortion. By contrast, the Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian denominations took a more liberal stance; which generated controversy among their members. In addition, abortion attracted bipartisan support from some members of the New Zealand Parliament including Labour MPs Mary Batchelor and Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan, and National MPs George Gair and Marilyn Waring.

The first abortion clinic in New Zealand was the Auckland Medical Aid Centre (AMAC), which opened in 1974 and introduced the practice of vacuum aspiration to New Zealand. By the end of its first year, it had provided 2,288 women with abortions. By 1975, this figure had risen to 4,005. AMAC attracted opposition from anti-abortion activists including arson attacks. The New Zealand Police also raided AMAC in 1974, leading to the prosecution and acquittal of one of its doctors, Jim Woolnough.

===Decriminalising abortion, 1977–1978===
In response to AMAC, the New Zealand Parliament passed Labour MP and SPUC member&#x27;s Gerard Wall&#x27;s Hospitals Amendment Act 1975 which limited the provision of abortion services to licensed hospitals. While AMAC was forced to close, it later reopened in 1980 after buying a private hospital. The Hospitals Amendment Act was later invalidated on technical grounds. In response to the closure of AMAC, abortion rights activists established the Sisters Overseas Service (SOS), which helped women travel to Australia for abortion operations in 1978 and 1979. McCulloch estimates that SOS chapters across New Zealand including Auckland and Wellington sent between 4,000 and 4,500 women to Australia for abortion operations during that period. National Party MP Frank Gill later tried to entrench Wall&#x27;s bill through the Health Amendment Bill 1976 but pro-abortion rights National MP George Gair managed to pass an amendment deferring it by twelve months.

In response to growing public debate around abortion, Parliament set up a Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion to consider public policy on these issues. At the Commission&#x27;s recommendations, the Third National Government passed the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 (CS&amp;A Act 1977) on 15 December 1977, which established the legal framework for abortion in New Zealand. Under the CS&amp;A Act, a woman seeking abortion had to see their doctor and the two medical consultants, who would assess the mental and physical grounds for carrying out an abortion. A surgeon would also be needed to perform an abortion. Counselling was also made available to women seeking an abortion. The CS&amp;A Act also established an Abortion Supervisory Committee to regulate the certifying consultants responsible for permitting abortions. The Act also required district health boards to fund abortions. During the late 1970s and 1980s, several public and private abortion clinics were opened in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.

The CS&amp;A Act was criticised by the feminist group Campaign to Oppose Repressive Abortion Laws (CORAL) and WONAAC as being too restrictive and infringing on women&#x27;s reproductive rights. In 1977, the Government also amended the Crimes Act 1961 to allow abortion within the 20 weeks gestation period. After 20 weeks, abortion was permitted on the grounds of saving the mother&#x27;s life and preventing serious permanent injury to her mental and physical health. In 1978, the Government further amended the Crimes Act to permit abortion on the grounds of saving the mother&#x27;s life, mental health, and physical health; foetal abnormality within the 20 weeks gestation period; and incest or sexual intercourse with guardians and family members. In 1986, the Crimes Act was further amended to take into account factors like the extremes of age and sexual violation.

===Post decriminalisation, 1977–1990s===
Following the decriminalisation of abortion, ALRANZ lobbied several hospital boards into establishing more abortion clinics and services. In November 1978, Epsom Day clinic opened in Auckland in November 1978. This was followed by the establishment of Wellington&#x27;s Parkview Clinic in July 1980 and Christchurch&#x27;s Lyndhurst Hospital in January 1986. Together with AMAC, these three clinics have provided the vast majority of abortions in New Zealand. ALRANZ and other abortion rights groups shifted their attention to lobbying for sex education in schools and easing young people&#x27;s access to contraceptives. In response, anti-abortion activists and groups picketed abortion clinics and joined forces with socially-conservative moral groups including Moral Rearmament, Family Rights Association, Society for the Protection of Community Standards (SPCS), and &quot;Family 75&quot; during the late 1970s and 1980s.

SPUC was at the forefront of opposing abortion during the 1980s. In 1980, SPUC secured the removal of two members of the Abortion Supervisory Committee on the grounds that they had been promoting abortion by encouraging hospital boards to establish abortion services. That same year, two SPUC–backed candidates were elected to the Wellington hospital board. In 1981, the president of SPUC&#x27;s Dunedin branch, John O&#x27;Neill sought injunctions on behalf of men who wanted to stop their lovers or partners from having abortions. In three of these cases, the women involved managed to obtain their abortions before the courts could intervene. When a judge imposed an interim injunction against an abortion an hour after it had taken place, WONAAC and Alranz staged a protest outside the Court of Appeal in Wellington to protest the judge&#x27;s action. In 1982, SPUC also unsuccessfully lobbied for all foetuses to be officially registered in the national Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages.

In 1982, a New Plymouth paediatrician Melvyn Wall sought a judicial review of a decision by two certifying consultants to allow an abortion for a fifteen-year-old girl, alleging that they had acted in &quot;bad faith&quot;. Wall&#x27;s motion was dismissed on the grounds that he had no right to mount the challenge and that decisions by certifying consultants were deemed not open to review, and because embryos and fetuses were not statutorily defined within the Contraception Sterilisation and Abortion Act 1977 or any of the Crimes Act 1961 clauses related to abortion. While SPUC&#x27;s President Marilyn Pryor regarded &quot;Wall vs. Livingston&quot; as a major loss for anti-abortion advocates, ALRANZ welcomed the ruling for upholding women&#x27;s access to abortion services. WONAAC also successfully appealed to the Medical Practitioners&#x27; Disciplinary Committee for Wall to be censured on the grounds that he had violated patient confidentiality. Wall was also fined NZ$1,500. While Wall had the censure revoked, the Medical Council found him liable for professional misconduct and added $500 in costs to the original amount.

In 1983, National Member of Parliament Doug Kidd, with the support of SPUC, introduced a private member&#x27;s bill called the Status of the Unborn Child Bill. In response, the feminist National Member of Parliament Marilyn Waring introduced the pro-abortion rights Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Repeal Bill to challenge Kidd&#x27;s bill. Waring also leaked news about Kidd&#x27;s affair with a parliamentary secretary to WONAAC. Ultimately, both Kidd and Waring&#x27;s bills were defeated and no changes were made to existing abortion legislation. While Pryor blamed the Status of the Unborn Child Bill&#x27;s hasty introduction for its defeat, abortion rights journalist Alison McCulloch has attributed the bill&#x27;s defeat to both Waring&#x27;s counter-bill and Kidd&#x27;s affair.

In 1987, O&#x27;Neill of SPUC appeared before the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s Justice and Law Reform Committee and demanded the dismissal of the Abortion Supervisory Committee (including the two SPUC–backed members) on the grounds they had failed to carry out their functions. That same year, Leo Buchanan, the medical superintendent of Masterton hospital refused to apply for a renewal of the hospital&#x27;s license to provide abortion services, citing his conscientious objection to abortion. Buchanan&#x27;s actions effectively ended abortion services in the Wairarapa region. In 1991, O&#x27;Neill challenged the validity of abortion licenses throughout New Zealand, leading to the temporary suspension of abortion operations in Dunedin and Waikato for several days. The Otago Health Board&#x27;s abortion license was suspended on the grounds of a legal technicality connected with the change from the Hospitals Act 1975 to the Area Health Boards Act.

During the late 1980s, WONAAC unsuccessfully lobbied several feminist MPs including Sonja Davies and the Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs Margaret Shields for a more liberal abortion law in the form of a private member&#x27;s bill. However, the Fourth Labour Government thought there was insufficient support for further abortion reform and instead passed the Contraceptive, Sterilisation and Abortion Amendment Act 1990, which eliminated the restriction on who could educate and provide services and supplies. The–then Health Minister and future Prime Minister Helen Clark sponsored the CS&amp;A Amendment Act.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, an anti-abortion group called Operation Rescue New Zealand was active, modeling itself after the American-based Randall Terry&#x27;s Operation Rescue organisation. Operation Rescue used aggressive clinics including picketing abortion clinics, remonstrating with abortion patients, breaking into buildings and operation theatres to disrupt operations, and distributing leaflets attacking abortion practitioners as &quot;baby killers&quot;. Operation Rescue was also criticised for its aggressive tactics by the anti-abortion movement with Women for Live&#x27;s president Anettta Moran rejecting the group&#x27;s willingness to break the law. While SPUC&#x27;s leadership was initially critical of Operation Rescue NZ, the leadership subsequently relented and allowed SPUC members to participate. Operation Rescue NZ had a large Catholic component including priests and clergy. According to McCulloch, an estimated half of Operation Rescue&#x27;s supporters were also SPUC members. Operation Rescue&#x27;s activities also attracted counter-protests from WONAAC and the Wellington-based group Choice.

===Into the 21st century===
====Attempts at abortion law reform, 1999–2001====
In 1999, the Abortion Supervisory Committee&#x27;s annual report criticised MPs for using it as a buffer between them and abortion interest groups, allowing them to abrogate their responsibilities. In response to that report, the newly-formed Fifth Labour Government, which was in coalition with the Alliance party, made attempts to reform New Zealand&#x27;s abortion laws. After several months of preparatory work, the Cabinet agreed to amend the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act 1977 in July 2001 to allow one doctor to approve an abortion. The Cabinet also submitted a Supplementary Order Paper exploring the grounds for abortion, possible decriminalisation, and the abolition of the Abortion Supervisory Committee. However, this plan was scuttled due to growing troubles within the Labour–Alliance coalition government.

====Introducing medical abortions, 2002–2003====
Former ALRANZ president Margaret Sparrow established a non-profit company called Istar to import mifepristone (formerly known as RU 486), a pill used in medical abortions to cause the embryo to dislodge from the uterine wall, and a prostaglandin supplement to expel the remains. In 2002, Istar convinced the Abortion Supervisory Committee to seek a Court ruling on how the CS&amp;A Act 1977 applied to the use of mifepristone. In April 2003, Justice Durie ruled that women seeking medical abortions must take medications in a licensed facility but need not remain there between taking the two sets of tablets, which are taken 48 hours apart. Women also need not stay in the facility until the expulsion of the foetus completes the abortion.

====2004 Parental notification amendment bill====
In 2004, the Fifth Labour Government passed the Care of Children Act 2004 which allows a girl under the age of 16 to seek an abortion through the framework of the CS&amp;A Act 1977. That same year, National Party MP Judith Collins, with the support of anti-abortion lobby group Voice for Life (formerly SPUC), proposed an amendment to that law requiring anyone under 16 years of age to notify their parents before having an abortion. Collins was opposed by ALRANZ, the New Zealand Medical Association and New Zealand College of General Practitioners.

A &quot;NZ Herald&quot; Digipoll showed that 71% of New Zealanders believed parents should be informed about whether or not their child was to have an abortion, with 60% believing this should be legally mandatory. This &quot;parental notification&quot; legislation was heavily defeated, as the New Zealand Medical Association and New Zealand College of General Practitioners objected that the abrogation of medical confidentiality would endanger pregnant incest survivors, and/or those within similar dysfunctional families and abusive parents.

====2008 informed consent amendment bill====
During the 48th New Zealand Parliament, former Kiwi Party list MP Gordon Copeland placed a members bill, the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion (Informed Consent) Amendment Bill, in the ballot. It was based on an Australian Capital Territory &#x27;informed consent&#x27; piece of legislation, since repealed. It was not drawn from the ballot, but in April 2008 Copeland sought to introduce it for consideration by leave, which he did not receive. Copeland has since been voted out of Parliament, as he did not secure a constituency seat at the New Zealand general election held in 2008 and his Kiwi Party polled well under the five percent threshold under the MMP framework in the Electoral Act 1993. Copeland passed away in August 2018 

====Chadwick&#x27;s proposed amendment, 2010====
In July 2010, Labour MP Steve Chadwick proposed an Abortion Reform Bill to take abortion out of the Crimes Act 1961. The anti-abortion organisation Voice for Life opposed the Bill while ALRANZ supported it. Due to fierce opposition from anti-abortion opponents and a lack of sufficient parliamentary support, Chadwick was unable to get the numbers to put her Bill into ballot. Even the progressive Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand declined to issue a public statement supporting Chadwick&#x27;s bill. After Chadwick lost her seat in Parliament in the 2011 general election, she lamented the weakened state of the abortion rights movement in New Zealand and opined that change was only possible if the New Zealand Law Commission produced recommendations that any government would touch upon.

====Challenges to abortion, 2009–2012====
In 2009, the anti-abortion group Right to Life New Zealand launched a court case against the Abortion Supervisory Committee, accusing it of not sufficiently regulating abortion by allowing broad interpretation of the mental health exception. A High Court decision supported some of Right to Life New Zealand&#x27;s points, finding that there was de facto abortion on demand. However, the Abortion Supervisory Committee appealed this to the New Zealand Court of Appeal.

On 1 June 2011 the Court of Appeal overturned the earlier High Court verdict favoring Right to Life, finding that there was no statutory reference to embryos and foetuses within New Zealand law, and therefore no grounds for further attempted interference with existing abortion access procedures. It did not, however, overturn the finding that there was de facto abortion on demand in New Zealand. In March 2012, Right to Life appealed to the New Zealand Supreme Court, which dismissed their appeal by a 3–2 majority in August 2012.

On 7 April 2011, during the term of the 49th New Zealand Parliament, Māori Party co-leader Tariana Turia moved that an anti-abortion Pacific Island doctor, Ate Moala, be appointed to the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The vote was lost 70–30 against, with twenty absences or abstentions. That same year, anti-abortion groups successfully campaigned against an attempt by Family Planning New Zealand to introduce early medical abortions at one of its clinics.

====Renewed abortion reform efforts, 2018====
During the 2010s, a wave of international abortion reform law changes led to a renewed campaign by New Zealand abortion rights advocates to decriminalise abortion. ALRANZ and other abortion rights groups argued that abortion was a health and reproductive rights issue that should be removed from the Crimes Act. In 2018, ALRANZ and a group of women who had had abortions filed a case with the Human Rights Commission challenging the existing abortion legal framework in New Zealand.

In late February 2018, the Minister of Justice Andrew Little sought advice from the New Zealand Law Commission on realigning the country&#x27;s abortion legal framework towards a health approach. The Law Commission also received 3,419 public submissions on abortion law reform between 4 April and 18 May 2018. In late October 2018, the Law Commission proposed three options: having no statutory test to make sure the abortion was appropriate at any point; taking abortion off the Crimes Act but having a statutory test; or only having a test for later-term abortions, after 22 weeks.

====2019–2020 abortion reform legislation====
On 5 August 2019, the Justice Minister Andrew Little announced that the Government would be introducing new legislation giving women access to abortion for the first 20 weeks of pregnancy without having to navigate legal loopholes and removing abortion from the Crimes Act 1961. However Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was not a government bill.

Other changes included allowing women to self-refer to an abortion service, ensuring that health practitioners advise women about counselling services, establishing safe areas around abortion facilities, and ensuring that conscientious objecting doctors inform women about their stance and alternative services. The Government adopted the Law Commission&#x27;s third approach for a test on later-term abortions but reduced the time-frame to 20 weeks. The test for late term abortions is contained in section 11 of the proposed bill. Section 11 states that &quot;a qualified health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is more than 20 weeks pregnant only if the health practitioner reasonably believes that the abortion is appropriate in the circumstances...&quot;

A Down Syndrome-themed anti-abortion group &quot;Saving Downs&quot; and conservative disability acticvists objected to Section 11 on the grounds that would facilitate the termination of babies with disabilities right through to birth. Both ALRANZ and Family Planning welcomed the proposed changes but criticised the 20-week limit. By contrast, conservative lobby group Family First New Zealand criticised the Government&#x27;s abortion law reform as &quot;radical... and anti-human rights&quot;.

Labour and its coalition partner New Zealand First engaged in several months of negotiations discussing the legislation. The Minister for Children and New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin reportedly played an important part in these negotiations. Despite initially ruling out a referendum, NZ First leader Winston Peters subsequently demanded a binding referendum on abortion reform. In response, Opposition National MP Amy Adams criticised NZ First&#x27;s U-turn, saying that the matter should be decided by Parliament. Former National Party leader Simon Bridges indicated that he would support a Select Committee examining the bill. Voting for the new legislation was done through a conscience vote. Justice Minister Little ruled out NZ First&#x27;s calls for holding a referendum on abortion reform.Former National Party leader Bridges voted against abortion reform but allowed National MPs to exercise a conscience vote.

On 8 August, the Abortion Legislation Bill passed its first reading by 94–23 votes and was referred to select committee stage. By October 2019, the Abortion Legislation Committee had received 25,000 submissions from various legal and medical experts, religious groups, national organisations and ordinary people sharing personal experiences. Due to the large volume of submissions, the Committee only heard 150 oral submissions out of the 2,890 who had opted to speak.

In mid-February 2020, the Abortion Legislation Committee recommended safeguards to address sex selection, late-term abortions, eliminating some barriers for women seeking abortions, and requiring a health professional approving abortion after 20 weeks to consult with another health professional including nurses and medical practitioners. In addition, conservative Catholic National MP Agnes Loheni published a minority report criticising the bill for what she regarded as a lack of safeguards on foetal abnormalities and late-term abortions. ACT New Zealand leader David Seymour supported the Select Committee&#x27;s recommendations but argued that safe zones infringed on freedom of expression.

While the New Zealand Medical Association welcomed these changes, Catholic bishops said that the legislation lacked safeguards for fetuses with disabilities. 
On 3 March 2020, the Bill passed its second reading by a narrower margin of 81–39 votes and was referred to a committee of the whole house. On 10 March, a Committee of the Whole House considered and rejected several anti-abortion amendments that included reducing penalties for safe zones, eliminating statutory tests for abortion up to birth, preventing gender-selective abortions, and requiring medical intervention of unintended live births. However, the committee passed two amendments including one by Labour MP Ruth Dyson dealing with conscientious objection and one by ACT Party MP David Seymour eliminating safe zones around abortion clinics.

On 18 March, the Abortion Legislation Bill passed its third and final reading by a margin of 68 to 51. The bill&#x27;s passage preceded a debate that same day where parliamentarians voted by 100–19 votes against holding a public referendum on abortion.

====Safe access zone legislation====
On 10 March 2021, a private members bill, the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion (Safe Areas) Amendment Bill was introduced into the New Zealand Parliament. Its purpose was creation if safe areas around abortion facilities, on a case-by-case basis, &quot;to protect the safety and well-being, and respect the privacy and dignity, of women accessing abortion facilities and practitioners providing and assisting with abortion services&quot;. It passed its first parliamentary reading (100–15), and two more parliamentary readings, as well as transit through a parliamentary select committee that assessed submissions for and against its passage. 

On 16 March 2022, the Safe Areas Amendment Act passed into law by a margin of 108 to 12 votes. It received royal assent on 18 March. The Bill created safe spaces of no more than 150 metres around abortion providers. It also banned obstruction, filming in an intimidating manner, dissuading or protesting against those trying to access abortion services in those zones.

==Public opinion and activism==
In March 2019, 69.9% of respondents to a poll by &quot;Newshub&quot; supported the decriminalisation of abortion.

===Abortion rights groups and supporters===

The main abortion rights lobby group is Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand (ALRANZ), which favours the complete decriminalisation of abortion in New Zealand. During the 1990s and early 2000s, ALRANZ experienced a steep decline in membership, with ALRANZ&#x27;s Christchurch and Hawke&#x27;s Bay branches shutting down in 1996 and 2004. By 2011, ALRANZ&#x27;s membership had dwindled to around 235 members. Contemporary abortion rights activism focused on defending the status quo from anti-abortionists and lobbying for the legalisation of Mifepristone for use in medical abortions, until decriminalisation finally occurred in 2019. Historical abortion rights lobby groups have included the more radical Women&#x27;s National Abortion Action Campaign (WONAAC), the Auckland Anti-Hospitals Amendment Bill Committee, the May Abortion Action Committee, and the National Organisation for Women (NOW).

Some professional bodies have also taken a pro-choice position. New Zealand Family Planning (formerly the Family Planning Association) supports abortion laws that respect women&#x27;s autonomy and human rights. The New Zealand Medical Association supports abortion reform including the removal of abortion from the Crimes Act 1961.

The New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists (NZARH) long advocated the removal of abortion from the Crimes Act 1961, viewing it as a matter of reproductive rights. Amnesty International New Zealand also supported abortion law reform including the removal of abortion from the Crimes Act.

===Anti-abortion groups and supporters===

The first major anti-abortion group in New Zealand was the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC), which was led by Marilyn Pryor. SPUC drew support from the Catholic Church in New Zealand, conservative evangelical Protestant churches and social conservative politicians from the two major parties, Labour and National. By 1975, SPUC had 28 branches and 40,000 members. Policy differences between the national leadership and the Christchurch branch led by Ken Orr led to SPUC&#x27;s splintering in 2000. The Christchurch branch renamed itself Right to Life New Zealand in September 2000 while the national organisation rebranded itself as Voice for Life in 2004.

Other anti-abortion groups include Family Life International, Family First New Zealand, the youth-based organisation ProLife NZ, Focus on the Family New Zealand. Some of these anti-abortion groups had international connections from which they derived tactics, strategy, rhetoric and messaging and also took an interest in other issues including euthanasia and in vitro fertilisation. These anti-abortion groups were often well-funded. According to McCulloch, Right to Life had an annual income of NZ$25,000 to NZ$35,000 a year during the mid-to-late 2000s; spending NZ$80,000 on its legal challenge against the Abortion Supervisory Committee by May 2009. Some former anti-abortion groups also included Operation Rescue New Zealand, Women for Life, and the Kiwi Party, now all defunct. In 2013, McCulloch has estimated that the anti-abortion movement in New Zealand had tens of thousands of members.

Anti-abortion activism have included picketing abortion clinics and hospitals, targeting doctors and members of the Abortion Supervisory Committee, public booths, newspaper advertisements, distributing informational material, lobbying politicians, letters to the editor, and protests. Operation Rescue NZ drew controversy for its aggressive methods which included invading abortion clinics and operating theatres and sending death threats to abortion practitioners. Anti-abortion groups have also pursued a &quot;Stop Family Planning&quot; campaign reminiscent of similar efforts in the United States against Planned Parenthood. In 2009, former Prolife New Zealand leader Andy Moore created a spoof website using the domain name &quot;alranz.org.nz&quot; which attacked Alranz. After &quot;alranz.org.nz&quot; was shut down by a successful complaint, Moore created a wiki called &quot;AbortionWiki&quot; which targeted ALRANZ and other abortion rights supporters.

In addition, violent militant elements of the anti-abortion movement have also perpetrated arson attacks and bomb threats against abortion clinics. The Auckland Medical Aid Centre experienced several arson attacks in 1976 and 1989. Lyndhurst clinic in Christchurch experienced arson attacks in May 1985 and October 1989. In 1999 Graeme White was jailed for tunneling into Lyndhurst clinic in a failed attempt to blow it up. Epsom Day clinic experienced an arson attack in 1985, a firebombing in April 1987, and a bomb threat in October 1989. These violent attacks on clinics were disavowed by anti-abortion leaders including Marilyn Pryor and Auckland SPUC president John Carroll.

===Religious denominations and organisations===
====Christian====
The Catholic Church in New Zealand has remained an opponent of abortion, teaching that life begins at conception. The Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand has expressed concerns that the Abortion Legislation Act 2020 does not protect foetuses and could lead to sex and disability-selective abortions.

The New Zealand Christian Network takes the view that abortion should be &quot;safe, legal and rare&quot; and opposed Abortion Legislation Bill on the grounds that it does not protect unborn foetuses and would facilitate elective abortion care. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) opposes elective abortions for personal and social convenience but permits abortion in cases of rape, incest, protecting the life and health of the mother, and fetal deformities. The LDS Church has not taken a stand on legislative proposals and public demonstrations regarding abortion.

Over the last fifty years, according to the New Zealand Census, New Zealand society has substantially secularised. In 2018, the New Zealand Census noted that Christian religious observance occupied less than half of New Zealand&#x27;s citizenship. Of those, Catholicism and conservative evangelical Protestantism provided even smaller segments.

==Political parties&#x27; positions==
===ACT Party===
The libertarian ACT Party views abortion as a personal right for women. In 2019 the party supported reforming New Zealand&#x27;s abortion laws.

===Green Party===
The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand supports decriminalising abortion, regarding it as a matter of female autonomy.
All Green MPs voted in support of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020

===Labour Party===
During New Zealand general election, 2017, the Labour Party&#x27;s leader Jacinda Ardern said a Labour government would decriminalise abortion. Minister of Justice Andrew Little has also supported abortion reform, arguing that a woman should have the right to decide unless the pregnancy is more than 22 weeks.

Labour Party MPs voted 37 to 9 strongly in favour of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020.

===National Party===
In a conscience vote, National Party MPs voted 35 to 19 against the Abortion Legislation Act 2020.

===NZ First===
NZ First voted 7 to 2 against the Abortion Legislation Act 2020.

===New Conservative Party===
The New Conservative Party, which has never been represented in the New Zealand Parliament, strongly opposed abortion and advocated for parental notification for adolescent abortions.

Since 1978, the Abortion Supervisory Committee (ASC) has collected statistics on the numbers of terminations performed each year, and for what reason, under the terms of the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977. In 1983, Statistics New Zealand agreed to process abortion statistics on behalf of the ASC and subsequently took over responsibility for releasing abortion-related statistics in 1998. Since abortion was illegal until 1977, there are no exact figures on abortions prior to the 1970s. Megan Cook estimates that 10,000 abortions took place each year during the 1930s, based on statistics relating to the number of women admitted to hospital during that period for septic abortions.

===Historical figures===
During the 1970s and 1980s, the abortion rate per woman rose from 0.02 in 1971 to 0.30 by 1986. The number of unmarried women seeking abortions, including those in de facto relationships, also increased. During that period, women aged 24 and younger were more likely to seek abortions than older women. While European New Zealanders were more likely to have an abortion at a younger age to end an unwanted pregnancy, Māori and Pasifika New Zealanders were more likely to use abortion due to lack of access to contraception.

According to figures released by Statistics New Zealand, the number of abortions rose from 8.5 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years in 1980 to 14 per 1,000 women in 1990. By 2000, this figure had risen to 18.7 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years but has since declined to 13.5 per 1,000 women as of 2018.

As the annual statistics for the Abortion Supervisory Committee have repeatedly said, mental health grounds are the predominant grounds for most certified abortions in New Zealand. The high numbers of abortions in New Zealand for mental health grounds have led anti-abortionists to express concerns that the mental health exception is being used to allow abortion on demand. By contrast, ALRANZ says that successive abortion-related case law has preserved the status quo of partial decriminalisation and liberal terms of abortion access for most New Zealand women who need an abortion.

===2018 abortion statistics===
According to Statistics New Zealand, 13,282 induced abortions had been performed in New Zealand in 2018. There were 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years in 2018, down from 13.7 per 1,000 women in 2017. Split amongst ethnicity in 2018, the highest rates were among European women (7,567), followed by Māori (2,979), Asian women (2,789), and Pacific women (1,354), and MELAA (or Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African) (215).

In 2017, New Zealand&#x27;s abortion rate of 13.7 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years was similar to the United States (13.5), South Australia (13.2 in 2016). This is below England and Wales (17.0), France (17.2), and Sweden (19.8) but higher than Germany (7.1), Finland (9.6), Scotland (12.1), and Norway (12.5).

<doc id="645289" wikidata="Q335680" url="?curid=645289" title="Jimmy Fallon">
<text>James Thomas Fallon (born September 19, 1974) is an American comedian, television host, actor, singer, writer, and producer. Best known for his work in television, Fallon&#x27;s breakthrough came during his tenure as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1998 to 2004. He was the host of the late-night talk show &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; from 2009 to 2014 and became the anchor of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; following his departure from &quot;Late Night&quot;.

Fallon grew up with a love of comedy and music, moving to Los Angeles when he turned 21 to pursue stand-up comedy. He joined &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a cast member in 1998, fulfilling a lifelong dream. During his six years on &quot;SNL&quot;, Fallon co-hosted the program&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment. He left the show in 2004 to star in films such as &quot;Taxi&quot; (2004) and &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (2005).

Following his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on NBC in 2009, where he became known for his emphasis on music and video games. He moved from that show to become the sixth permanent host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 2014. In addition to his television work, he has released two comedy albums and seven books, mainly aimed at children.
==Early life==
James Thomas Fallon was born in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of New York City&#x27;s Brooklyn borough on September 19, 1974, the son of Gloria (née Feeley) and James W. Fallon. His paternal grandmother was a German immigrant from Osterholz-Scharmbeck, while his matrilineal great-grandfather was a Norwegian immigrant from Fredrikstad. One set of his great-great-grandparents were an Irish couple from County Galway, with this great-great-grandmother herself being born to an Irish couple in France.

Fallon&#x27;s father spent his adolescence singing in street-corner doo-wop groups then served in the Vietnam War. Shortly after his son&#x27;s birth, he started working as a machine repairman for IBM in Kingston, New York. In preparation, the family moved nearby to Saugerties, New York. Fallon has described his childhood as idyllic, while his parents have been described as overprotective. He and his older sister, Gloria, were unable to leave their home and had to ride their bicycles in the backyard. Fallon attended the Roman Catholic school St. Mary of the Snow. He considered becoming a priest, inspired by his experiences as an altar boy, but became more interested in comedy instead. He spent many nights listening to the radio program &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot;, which exposed him to both comedy and music; he often recorded it on a reel-to-reel recorder.

As a teenager, Fallon developed an obsession with the late-night comedy program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He watched it religiously, although he was only allowed to see &quot;the clean parts&quot; that his parents taped for him. He and Gloria would re-enact sketches such as &quot;The Festrunk Brothers&quot; with friends. In his teens, he impressed his parents with impersonations, including of actor James Cagney and comedian Dana Carvey. He was musically inclined and started playing guitar at age 13, going on to perform comedy and music in contests and shows. By his junior high years, he was labeled a class clown but was also described as &quot;nice and well-mannered&quot;.

At Saugerties High School, Fallon was a performer in most stage productions and was twice a class social director. He won a young comedian&#x27;s contest with an impression of Pee-wee Herman. He graduated in 1992 and then attended The College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York, where he was a computer science major before switching to communications in his senior year. He was an average student who would perform stand-up comedy on weekends. He would often board buses from his aunt&#x27;s house in Fort Hamilton to perform sets at Carolines on Broadway in Times Square. He did not graduate, leaving college a semester early to pursue a comedy career.

Fourteen years later, in May 2009, Fallon returned to receive a Bachelor of Arts in communications, awarded by Saint Rose officials who granted him experiential learning credits for his television work. He joined his classmates at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center to collect his degree, where along with his BA, he was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.

==Career==
===Comedy beginnings===
Fallon dropped out of the College of Saint Rose in 1995 to move to Los Angeles and pursue comedy full-time. He secured a manager and got bookings by the age of 21. He often did stand-up at the Improv, earning $7.50 per set, and he joined classes with the Groundlings, an improv comedy troupe. He appeared in the feature film &quot;The Scheme&quot; (originally entitled &quot;The Entrepreneurs&quot;). His one line in the 1997 film &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; was cut, but he can still be seen in the background. In 1998, Fallon appeared briefly on the show &quot;Spin City&quot; in the second season as a man selling photographs.

He remained fixated on joining &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. After two years of working with the Groundlings, he auditioned for the program in 1997 but was unsuccessful. When he was cast in a pilot presentation for The WB, Fallon made sure to include a clause in his contract specifying that if he were to join &quot;SNL&quot; he would be released from his contract. His manager sent videotapes to Marci Klein and Ayala Cohen, producers for &quot;SNL&quot;.

Fallon landed his second audition at the age of 23. At the &quot;notoriously difficult audition,&quot; he was told by several people that creator Lorne Michaels almost never laughed during auditions. He feared being outshined by the comic before him, who came armed with an arsenal of props. Despite this, Fallon went onstage and did well, performing a &quot;celebrity walk-a-thon&quot; with impressions of Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Bill Cosby, and Adam Sandler, an &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus who had recently left the show. Michaels and others laughed.

Head writer Tina Fey, who was in the room, later said, &quot;He&#x27;s one of two people I&#x27;ve ever seen who was completely ready to be on the show. Kristen Wiig is the other one... And Jimmy was ready—like, if there had been a show to do that night.&quot; He rushed through his original characters in order to arrive at his musical impressions, which he felt were stronger. Three weeks passed, and despite his feeling that he had not gotten the position, he was asked to meet with Michaels at the Paramount lot in Los Angeles. Michaels informed him that they wanted him for the show, and Fallon characterized the moment as being in &quot;slow motion&quot;, remarking to Michaels before he left, &quot;I&#x27;m going to make you proud.&quot;

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; years===
====Early seasons (1998–2000)====

Fallon debuted on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a featured player at the beginning of the show&#x27;s twenty-fourth season in September 1998. He became a star by his fourth episode, when he performed Halloween-themed versions of songs by popular artists, as well as his Sandler impression. Fallon became a celebrity, considered charming by his largely female fan-base, receiving numerous letters from fans, and becoming the subject of numerous fan-sites. He became the program&#x27;s most featured mimic, doing popular impressions of Robert De Niro, Jerry Seinfeld, and Howard Stern. He also starred as many original characters, including Nick Burns, an IT support nerd, Pat &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan, one of the Boston Teens with Rachel Dratch, and in Jarret&#x27;s Room, a fictional webcast hosted by stoner college students Jarret (Fallon) and Gobi (Horatio Sanz). He was promoted to repertory player in his second season.

In his off-time, Fallon released a book comprising e-mail exchanges with his sister Gloria, titled &quot;I Hate This Place: A Pessimist&#x27;s Guide to Life&quot; (1999), and played a minor role in the film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000). During their time at &quot;SNL&quot;, Fallon and Horatio Sanz often drank together. Sanz has described himself and Fallon as &quot;super-functioning alcoholics&quot;, and said, &quot;They say that kind of goes hand-in-hand with &quot;SNL&quot;, some kind of substance-abuse issues, because it&#x27;s so stressful you easily find yourself blowing off steam a lot.&quot; On one occasion, they spent a Friday night watching The Strokes perform a midnight show, staying up drinking until the early morning, despite having to do &quot;SNL&quot; that night. &quot;We actually took what we thought being on &quot;SNL&quot; was, what people think is awesome about it, and we made it happen,&quot; said Sanz, who said that he and Fallon got in more than a few bar fights.

====Later years (2001–2004)====
Fallon initially planned to spend three years at &quot;SNL&quot;, like John Belushi, but he was persuaded to stay on for three more when given the reins to &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. His co-hosting of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; with writer Tina Fey further increased his profile. During this tenure, he formed a close relationship with Michaels, whom he&#x27;d consult on dating, career advice, and more. Fallon called a December 2001 sketch, in which he imitates Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in a mirror opposite Jagger, his favorite thing he had done up to that point.

In his later years on &quot;SNL&quot;, Fallon co-starred in a skit, &quot;&quot;The Barry Gibb Talk Show&quot;,&quot; in which he and musician Justin Timberlake portrayed Bee Gees brothers Barry and Robin Gibb. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Timberlake.

Fallon became known for his tendency to break character in sketches, an attribute he, as well as Michaels, disliked. It began in the famous &quot;More Cowbell&quot; sketch, when Will Ferrell wore a tighter shirt than expected, causing Fallon to crack up. After this, other cast members would try to get Fallon to break. Some cast members believed he was attempting to steal the moment, to make the sketch about himself. The joke became near-constant during Fallon&#x27;s final year on the show. During this time, Fallon parlayed his &quot;SNL&quot; success into co-hosting the 2001 MTV Movie Awards and 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, and recording his debut comedy album, &quot;The Bathroom Wall&quot; (2002), which was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. He also modeled for Calvin Klein. Fallon was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People in 2002, an honor Fallon found embarrassing.

Fallon appeared in blackface in a 2000 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, impersonating Chris Rock. After the sketch resurfaced online 20 years later, Fallon issued a tweet apologizing for an &quot;unquestionably offensive decision&quot;.

===Film career (2004–2008)===

Fallon began to pursue a film career in 2004. He had spurned most major roles due to lack of time and disinterest in the dozens of scripts he read. He signed on for his first lead role in &quot;Taxi&quot;, a remake of a French film, after co-star Queen Latifah became attached to the project. He was also attracted to the film&#x27;s action comedy tone, seeing comparisons with &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Eddie Murphy&#x27;s first big film, &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (1982).

In the fall of 2003, he split his time between shooting the film in Los Angeles and returning to New York City for &quot;SNL&quot;. With his contract ending, his sixth season at &quot;SNL&quot; was his last; Fallon signed off at the conclusion of the show&#x27;s twenty-ninth season in May 2004.

With big expectations from the studio, &quot;Taxi&quot; premiered in the fall of 2004. A flop with critics and audiences, it was Fallon&#x27;s first failure. 20th Century Fox had already signed him for his second major role, starring opposite Drew Barrymore in the 2005 romantic comedy &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; fared little better than &quot;Taxi&quot;, receiving mild reviews and tepid box office returns. He met his wife, producer Nancy Juvonen, during production of the film, and the two wed in December 2007.

Fallon began receiving fewer film offers. He had entered what he has called a &quot;lost period&quot;, drinking more alcohol and beset by confusion over his next career moves. Fallon moved back east to New York, spending &quot;a couple of years aimlessly knocking around.&quot; He wrote a screenplay during this time &quot;about a guy in a goth band who has to pretend to be a country-music star.&quot;

Before leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, Michaels had told Fallon that he would be a good fit to take over NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; franchise when then-host Conan O&#x27;Brien left for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Michaels urged NBC to give Fallon a holding deal in February 2007 so that he could not be lured elsewhere.

To prepare for the role of a late-night host, Fallon toured college campuses and comedy clubs for eight months, where he tested out a new 50-minute routine. He also began watching the comedy of Chevy Chase, Dick Cavett, and Johnny Carson, as well as &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. In May 2008, Fallon was announced as the successor to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot;.

Fallon was considered an odd choice for the job, both by executives at NBC (who &quot;hated&quot; the idea and predicted it to be a failure) and among the general public. This was alluded to in an early promo for the series: &quot;You loved him on &quot;SNL&quot;! You hated him in the movies! Now you&#x27;re ambivalent.&quot;

===Back to television and &quot;Late Night&quot; (2009–2013)===

&quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; premiered in March 2009 to mixed reviews. Producer Michael Shoemaker felt that the show&#x27;s style solidified when it used Susan Boyle as a joke. While other late-night programs had centered on her appearance, Fallon&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; debuted a sketch in which Boyle&#x27;s emotional performances could &quot;salve any affliction.&quot; It was this style of humor, that Adam Sternbergh of &quot;New York&quot; dubbed &quot;the comedy of unabashed celebration,&quot; that led to the program&#x27;s success.

Fallon proved himself different from other late-night hosts, with more of a reliance on music, dancing, impersonations, and games. Between his own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his house band, hip-hop collective The Roots, Fallon&#x27;s incarnation of &quot;Late Night&quot; &quot;evolved into the most deeply musical of TV&#x27;s musical-comedy variety programs,&quot; with sketches in which he parodies Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen going viral online.

Fallon&#x27;s show found its footing in 2010, during &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; debacle. The program embraced social media and the Internet, and online interaction and its presence on the show became crucial to its success. In 2010, the show scored its first viral clip: Fallon and Timberlake performing a &quot;History of Rap.&quot;

Fallon also hosted the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2010. In 2012, Fallon released his second comedy album, &quot;Blow Your Pants Off&quot;, which compiles many of his musical performances on &quot;Late Night&quot;. The album won a Grammy in 2013 for Best Comedy Album. Discussions for Fallon to take over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; began in early 2013.

, Fallon was earning a salary of $11 million a year for his work on &quot;Late Night&quot;.

===&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (2014–present)===

On April 3, 2013, following a period of speculation, NBC announced that Fallon would succeed Jay Leno, following the 2014 Winter Olympics, to become the sixth permanent host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Fallon and Leno sang a parody of the song &quot;Tonight&quot; about &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; together. Fallon&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; debut on February 17, 2014, on NBC&#x27;s network engaged 11.3 million viewers.

Fallon&#x27;s third book, &quot;Your Baby&#x27;s First Word Will Be Dada&quot;, a children&#x27;s book, was released in June 2015.

On September 15, 2016, Fallon hosted Donald Trump on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during the United States presidential election. Following the appearance, Fallon was criticized by some media critics and viewers on social media for the uncontroversial questions he asked of Trump. David Sims, writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, called the interview an &quot;embarrassment&quot;. In response to the criticism, Fallon said to TMZ: &quot;Have you seen my show? I&#x27;m never too hard on anyone. We&#x27;ll have Hillary [Clinton] on tomorrow, and we&#x27;ll do something fun with her too.&quot; Fallon apologized in March 2017 for the interview, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it to humanize him. I almost did it to minimize him. I didn&#x27;t think that would be a compliment ... After this happened, I was devastated. I didn&#x27;t mean anything by it. I was just trying to have fun.&quot; He again apologized for the interview in June 2018 on a podcast with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, saying that he &quot;made a mistake&quot; and added &quot;I did not do it to &#x27;normalize&#x27; him or to say I believe in his political beliefs or any of that stuff.&quot;
In 2020, Fallon and pacifier company WubbaNub created limited-edition pacifiers based on the penguin and cow characters from his children&#x27;s books.

In January 2022, Fallon was criticized for discussing NFTs (and promoting one of his own) on his show during an interview with Paris Hilton, which may have breached conflict-of-interest policies set by NBCUniversal&#x27;s parent company Comcast; his own NFT was deduced to have most likely been purchased in November 2021 for about $216,000, and his promotion of it on the show could have boosted its asking price. NBC responded to the criticism by stating that it did not believe Fallon had broken its conflict-of-interest rules.

On November 16, 2022, a Twitter hoax spread with the hashtag &quot;#RIPJimmyFallon&quot;, which started trending nationwide. Fallon asked Twitter owner Elon Musk for help, who joked &quot;Say something that only the real Jimmy would say...&quot; On his show the following day, Fallon made fun of the rumors in a skit described by &quot;Vulture&quot; as &quot;tent revival-esque.&quot;

On August 30, 2023, Fallon began hosting the comedy podcast &quot;Strike Force Five&quot; with Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, and John Oliver to support their staff members out of work due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.

In September 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published an article about Fallon and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; workplace culture titled &quot;Chaos, Comedy, and &#x27;Crying Rooms&#x27;: Inside Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s &#x27;Tonight Show&#x27;&quot;, based on interviews with 16 former and then-active employees. It alleged that Fallon mistreated his staff, acted erratically, was prone to outbursts, and contributed to a toxic workplace culture. According to former employees, Fallon&#x27;s behavior on a given day seemed to be related to whether he was allegedly hungover from the previous night. The abuse led to many employees referring to the special guests&#x27; dressing rooms as the &quot;crying rooms&quot; because that is where the employees would go to let out their emotions. NBC released a statement, defending the program, but they did not address the allegations against Fallon. The day of the article&#x27;s publication, he apologized to his staff on a Zoom call, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s embarrassing and I feel so bad. Sorry if I embarrassed you and your family and friends.&quot;

==Influences==
Fallon told David Steinberg on the Showtime series &quot;Inside Comedy&quot; that as a child he and his sister would imitate Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s &quot;Wild and Crazy Guys&quot; routines from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and that he listened to comedy records, learning to imitate Rodney Dangerfield from them. In 2009 he spoke on the influence of Monty Python when he appeared in the television documentary, &quot;Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)&quot;.

==Personal life==
Fallon married film producer Nancy Juvonen on December 22, 2007. They initially met on the set of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but they did not become friends until later on the set of &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. Fallon proposed in August 2007 with a bespoke engagement ring on the dock of Juvonen&#x27;s family home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. They were married four months later. Their daughters were born via surrogate in 2013 and 2014. They own a house in Sagaponack, New York, and previously lived in Gramercy Park, Manhattan, they also have a female English cream Golden Retriever named Gary Frick that has appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

On November 4, 2017, Fallon&#x27;s mother Gloria died from undisclosed causes at the age of 68 at NYU Langone Medical Center. Scheduled tapings of the following week&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; episodes were canceled. One week later, Fallon paid tribute to his mother following that night&#x27;s monologue, becoming emotional and calling her &quot;the best audience&quot;.

Fallon was raised Roman Catholic. In a 2011 interview with NPR, he expressed his fondness for the Latin Mass, but he stated he was no longer a regular churchgoer.

===Health problems===
On June 26, 2015, Fallon suffered a ring avulsion injury when he tripped over a rug in his home and tried to break his fall by holding onto a countertop, causing his finger to nearly get torn off by his wedding ring. He was taken to the emergency room and then sent to a surgeon who performed microsurgery on his finger. He spent 10 days in the ICU before going home. He discussed this on the July 13 episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and thanked the doctors and nurses who helped him. A month later, he was still expecting to spend another eight weeks without any feeling in his finger. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in September 2015, he explained that his finger still had limited mobility and that another surgery would be required. He reiterated this point at the 67th Emmy Awards on September 20, 2015, when he appeared in public without his finger bandaged for the first time since the accident.

On January 4, 2022, Fallon announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 over the holiday season. He thanked medical professionals and credited the COVID-19 vaccine with making him &quot;lucky enough to only have mild symptoms&quot;.

<text>Donald Sinclair Davis (August 4, 1942 – June 29, 2008) was an American character actor best known for playing General George Hammond in the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (1997–2007), and earlier for playing Major Garland Briggs on the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991), Captain William Scully in The X-Files. In animation, he was also known as Wild Bill in the 2003 direct-to-video animated movie &quot;G.I. Joe: Spy Troops&quot; and its 2004 sequel, &quot;G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom&quot;. He was also a theater professor, painter, and United States Army captain.

==Early life and education==
Davis was born and raised in Aurora, Missouri. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in theater and art from Southwest Missouri State College. He said that &quot;during the Vietnam era&quot; he &quot;was with the 7th Infantry in Korea&quot; and at another point was &quot;a personnel and administration officer; I ran records branches.&quot; He was a captain at Fort Leonard Wood by the time he left the U.S. Army, &quot;and worked with General Officers, so I&#x27;ve been able to use that in Hammond and other characters.&quot;

In 1970 he received a master&#x27;s degree in theatre from the Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU); his thesis was &quot;Design and Construction of Stage Settings for Black Comedy and The Two Executioners&quot;. He taught for several years before returning to SIUC to complete a Ph.D. degree in theatre; his dissertation was &quot;The Evolution of Scenography in the Western Theater&quot;.

He began working in the film industry in the 1980s, while teaching at the University of British Columbia. In 1987, he stopped teaching in order to pursue acting full-time.

==Career==
Davis stated that he landed the role of the eloquently spoken Major Briggs when &quot;I was living in Vancouver and doing local work. But because of my accent in the &#x27;80s I couldn&#x27;t play a Canadian in commercials. So someone suggested that I get an agent in Seattle. I did and was able to get commercial work and acting jobs there. I had a good resume. So when they were casting the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; pilot my agent sent me out to the audition. I met series creator David Lynch and didn&#x27;t actually read for him—we just visited. ... David liked me and started writing for me. He liked the chemistry I had with other players. I did three days on the pilot and then went on to the series. That was the luckiest break I could have had. There are at least a dozen people from that show who are lifelong friends because of that show. It was a life-changing experience.&quot;

In the TV show &quot;MacGyver&quot;, Davis was the stunt/photography double for Dana Elcar. He was often mistaken for Elcar, and vice versa. Davis did appear in two episodes of &quot;MacGyver&quot;, as a different character each time. His first appearance was as a cement truck driver in the episode &quot;Blow Out&quot;, and his second appearance was as the poacher Wyatt Porter in &quot;The Endangered&quot;. He also played Dana Scully&#x27;s father in the series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Canadian audiences may also be familiar with Davis thanks to his appearance in one of the famous &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot;, in which he played an arrogant American gold prospector who pulls a gun on Mountie Sam Steele. He also played the role of the Racine Belles&#x27; manager in the movie &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. He also had a guest-starring role in the pilot episode of the comedy-drama television series &quot;Psych&quot;, playing the character of Mr. McCallum.

He was a member of the main cast of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; during the first seven seasons of that television series, portraying General Hammond, commander of Stargate Command (SGC). He appeared in a recurring role during Seasons 8 to 10, cutting back his commitment due to health problems. He also played the character in one episode of the &quot;Stargate&quot; spin-off series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Davis died of a heart attack on June 29, 2008, at the age of 65. He had been suffering from heart disease and diabetes. At the time of his death, Davis was living in Gibsons, British Columbia, Canada. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. 

The writers of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; paid him homage by mentioning the death of his character George Hammond and naming a spaceship after him in the final episode of the show airing January 9, 2009. He was again honored in October 2009, with the appearance of the spaceship &quot;Hammond&quot; in the pilot episode of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. Coincidentally, in episode 16 of season 4 of &quot;SG-1&quot;, &quot;2010&quot; (an episode set in the future which originally aired in January 2001), it is stated that General Hammond had died of a heart attack prior to the episode&#x27;s events. His character on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, William Scully, had also died of a heart attack fourteen years earlier.

Davis did not live to see the release of one of his final performances, &quot;&quot;, released on July 29, 2008, one month after his death.

==Personal life==
Davis married Ruby Fleming in 2003, by which time he had a son, Matt Davis, from a previous marriage.

Davis was also a visual artist, spending most of his free time painting or carving. He grew up painting, sculpting, and drawing, and continued to pursue these crafts his entire life, supplementing his income with design commissions and art sales. On the DVD commentary track for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; season 6 episode 17 (&quot;Disclosure&quot;), Davis said that he once had a job carving wooden cigar store Indians that were sold at Silver Dollar City.

<text>George Harold Sisler (March 24, 1893 – March 26, 1973), nicknamed &quot;Gorgeous George&quot;, was an American professional baseball first baseman and player-manager. From 1915 through 1930, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators, and Boston Braves. He managed the Browns from 1924 through 1926.

Sisler played college baseball for the University of Michigan and was signed by the St. Louis Browns in 1915. He won the American League (AL) batting title in 1920 and 1922. In 1920, he batted .407 and recorded 257 hits, the record until Ichiro Suzuki had 262 in 2004. Sisler won the AL Most Valuable Player Award in 1922, finishing with a batting average of .420, the third-highest batting average by AL or NL players after 1900. An attack of sinusitis caused vision troubles that jeopardized Sisler&#x27;s career, but he returned to playing in 1924, remaining in the major leagues through the 1930 season. After Sisler retired as a player, he worked as a major league scout and aide.

A two-time batting champion and career .340 hitter, Sisler led the league in hits twice, triples twice, and stolen bases four times. He collected 200 or more hits six times in his career and had a batting average of over .300 a total of 13 times throughout his career. In 1939, Sisler was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
George Harold Sisler was born on March 24, 1893, in the unincorporated hamlet of Manchester (now part of the city of New Franklin, a suburb of Akron), Ohio. His parents, Cassius Clay and Mary (née Whipple) Sisler, had been married after meeting at Hiram College, which they both graduated from. Both worked as schoolteachers at one point, though by the time George was born, Cassius was supervising a nearby coal mine. Manchester did not have a high school; thus, when George turned 14, he moved to Akron to live with his older brother Efbert so that he could attend school there. Sisler played baseball, basketball, and football in high school, but baseball was his main focus. Because of his good looks, the local newspapers began referring to him as &quot;Gorgeous George&quot;. During George&#x27;s senior year, Efbert died of tuberculosis, but George was able to move in with a local family and finish school.

==College career==

In 1910, Sisler signed a professional contract with the Akron Champs of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, but he never played in the league or earned any money. Instead, he followed his parents&#x27; wishes and attended the University of Michigan, where he majored in mechanical engineering and played college baseball. Freshmen were not allowed to play on Michigan&#x27;s varsity teams, so Sisler pitched for an intra-campus team representing the school&#x27;s engineering students in 1912, striking out 20 batters in seven innings during one game. After the season, he pitched for an industrial team in Akron. Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was impressed when he observed Sisler in a game. He purchased Sisler&#x27;s contract and tried to force the player to join his ballclub in 1912. Refusing to report, Sisler was placed on the Pirates&#x27; suspended list, which threatened his professional eligibility.

Recognizing he was in trouble, Sisler consulted Branch Rickey, Michigan&#x27;s baseball coach. A former lawyer, Rickey determined that the contract should not bind Sisler, since the ballplayer signed it as a minor without the consent of his parents. Rickey and Detroit Judge George P. Codd contacted the National Commission, baseball&#x27;s governing body, asking for the contract to be declared illegal. The Commission failed to come to a decision in 1912 because one of its members, August Herrmann, thought Sisler should give the Pirates the first right to sign him, while Codd wanted the contract declared completely void. After Sisler&#x27;s junior year, with the time when he would play professional ball nearing, Codd pressed Herrmann for a decision, threatening to sue for triple damages. Herrmann obtained a legal opinion that agreed with Sisler&#x27;s position, and the Commission finally ruled the contract void in 1914.

Meanwhile, Sisler joined Michigan&#x27;s varsity team as a sophomore in 1913. He excelled on the mound for the Wolverines until a sore arm limited him late in the season. Offensively, he led the team with a .445 batting average, playing the outfield on days he was not pitching so his bat could remain in the lineup. &quot;Sporting Life&quot; proclaimed him &quot;the greatest college pitcher&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; named him an All-American for the first of three consecutive years.

Over the summer of 1913, Sisler consulted Youngstown physician John D. &quot;Bonesetter&quot; Reese about his sore arm. The Wolverines were now coached by Carl Lundgren, hired as Rickey&#x27;s successor after the former coach took a job with the St. Louis Browns. Sisler was feeling back in form by the time the season started, and his teammates voted him captain of the Wolverines. He helped the Wolverines hold opponents scoreless for 44 straight innings, personally striking out 10 batters in a row before reinjuring his arm in a game against Syracuse. At the end of the season, he had two hits, three runs scored, and two stolen bases in the first of two victories over the Penn Quakers that gave the Wolverines the 1914 college baseball national championship.

Sisler did not remain the captain in 1915, as Edmon McQueen was selected this time. Coach Lundgren planned to use him less as a pitcher early on in hopes that his arm would not be sore by the end of the year. The plan worked. Though pitching statistics for the year were not kept, Sisler had one game where he limited the Cornell Big Red to one hit, and in another game he struck out 14 Notre Dame players. He recorded five stolen bases in his final game for Michigan, even stealing home once during the game. Sisler batted .451 and committed no errors. He graduated in the summer of 1915 with his degree in mechanical engineering.

==Professional career==
===St. Louis Browns===
====Early years (1915–1919)====

Both Pittsburgh and the Browns were interested in signing Sisler to play professional baseball for them following his graduation. The Pirates offered $700 a month with a $1,000 bonus, but the Browns offered a $5,000 bonus with a $200-per-month salary. Sisler chose St. Louis because he was comfortable playing for Rickey, now the Browns&#x27; manager.

On June 28, 1915, Sisler made his major league debut, entering as a pitcher in relief against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched three scoreless innings and struck out two batters, while at the plate he collected his first major league hit, which came against Jim Scott. Five days later, he pitched a complete game victory in his first major league start, in which he struck out nine batters but also walked nine.

Rickey, however, thought Sisler was too good at baseball to confine himself to pitching every few days. First baseman John Leary was struggling at the position, and Rickey decided to try Sisler there. Initially, the stress of learning a new position sent Sisler into a batting slump, but after Rickey let him pitch another game, his confidence began to grow. Sisler still pitched and played the outfield as well in 1915; on August 29, he defeated Walter Johnson in a complete game, 2–1 victory. Offensively, he batted .285 with three home runs, while as a pitcher, he had a 4–4 record and what biographer Rick Huhn termed a &quot;very respectable&quot; 2.83 earned run average (ERA).

In 1916, Sisler became the Browns&#x27; full-time first baseman, playing the position for 141 of the team&#x27;s 158 games. His .305 batting average led the team, as did his hits (177) and slugging percentage (.400). Though Sisler&#x27;s 24 errors that year led American League (AL) first basemen, Huhn wrote that he demonstrated &quot;significant improvement and frequent brilliance&quot; at the position. He made only three appearances on the mound that year, but in his most notable, on September 17, he threw a shutout, defeating Johnson and the Senators 1–0.

On August 11, 1917, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, Sisler recorded three hits in four at bats. The performance began a 26-game hitting streak, during which Sisler batted .422. For the season, he led the team in most offensive categories, and his .353 batting average was second in the AL, behind Ty Cobb&#x27;s .383.

Following the American entry into World War I, the draft was enacted in the 1917–18 offseason. Browns Urban Shocker and Ken Williams were both drafted during the 1918 season, but Sisler&#x27;s Class 4 status kept him playing baseball for the whole year. Due to the war, the season ended on September 1, making it a month shorter than usual. Playing 114 games, Sisler led the AL with 45 stolen bases and placed third in the AL with a .341 batting average. A government-issued &quot;work or fight&quot; order required baseball players to assume essential wartime employment or become more eligible for the draft after the season. Sisler enlisted in the army, joining several major league players as a second lieutenant in a Chemical Warfare Service unit commanded by Rickey. Undergoing training at Camp Humphreys in Virginia, Sisler was preparing to go overseas until the war ended that November, relieving him from his military obligation.

Returning to the Browns in 1919, Sisler struggled offensively at the beginning of the year, batting .207 through May 11. His hitting improved thereafter, and Sisler led the AL in batting average and stolen bases by mid-August, while the Browns, at 47–40, were still in the race for the AL pennant. On August 22, the normally quiet-natured Sisler nearly exchanged blows with Carl Mays. Thinking that the Yankee pitcher was throwing at him and suspecting Mays of using an illegal substance, Sisler convinced umpire George Moriarty to search Mays, which Moriarty took 10 minutes to do. Nothing was found, and Mays and Sisler yelled at each other, squaring off to fight before Moriarty stepped between them and separated them. The Browns struggled late in the season, finishing fifth in the AL with a 62–72–1 record, but Sisler finished the year leading the team in all offensive categories except games played. His .352 average ranked third in the AL, and his 10 home runs were topped in the league only by Babe Ruth&#x27;s 29. Defensively, he had a .991 fielding percentage and led AL first basemen with 120 assists.

====.400 hitter and MVP (1920–1922)====

In 1920, baseballs began to be manufactured with a tighter-wound yarn, and a greater emphasis was placed on keeping the balls clean, which made them easier for the hitters to spot. These changes ushered in the live-ball era, in which many batters began to hit more home runs. Not possessing the arm strength of sluggers like Ruth, Sisler did not try for as many home runs, but his numbers rose in other offensive categories.

That season, Sisler played every inning of each game. He collected an MLB-record 257 hits, batting .407 and ending the season with averages of .442 in August and .448 in September. The total broke Cobb&#x27;s 1911 record of 247 hits in a single season. After tying the old record on September 27, Sisler set the new one on a day that was coincidentally dedicated to him, in which he was presented with a $1,000 check, a $1,500 silver service, and flowers before the game at Sportsman&#x27;s Park. His record lasted until 2004, when Ichiro Suzuki had 262 hits. Sisler also finished second in the AL in eight offensive categories, including home runs (19, behind Ruth&#x27;s 54), RBI (122, tied with teammate Baby Doll Jacobson behind Ruth&#x27;s 135), and stolen bases (42, behind Sam Rice&#x27;s 63). Despite finishing second to Ruth in home runs, Sisler did not attempt them as often, as he was able to maintain a higher batting average by merely focusing on making contact with the ball.

The Browns fired manager Jimmy Burke over the 1920–21 offseason, offering the position to Sisler. He declined, fearing that the added responsibilities would interfere with his hitting. Sisler received the only suspension of his career on July 24. After umpire George Hildebrand ruled him out in a close play at first base to end the fourth inning, Sisler shoved the umpire. Told by Hildebrand not to take his position in the fifth inning, Sisler then punched the umpire. Though the suspension was listed as indefinite, rainouts helped Sisler miss only three games before getting reinstated. Against the Detroit Tigers from August 13 through 15, Sisler recorded 10 straight hits, one short of Tris Speaker&#x27;s 1920 record for most consecutive hits. Though not quite as successful offensively in 1921 as he had been the year before, Sisler led the AL with 18 triples (tied with Howie Shanks and teammate Jack Tobin) and 35 stolen bases, also finishing fourth in the league with a .371 batting average. Defensively, he had a .993 fielding percentage over 138 games.

Sisler battled Cobb for the batting title in 1922. Cobb moved into the lead in late July, but Sisler tied him on August 7, at which point both players were batting .409. The Browns were in a tight pennant race with the New York Yankees, whom they trailed by games as late as September 10. Against the Tigers on September 11, Sisler fell on his arm while stretching to his right to catch a wide throw from Wally Gerber. He suffered a strained deltoid muscle. Newspapers suggested that he would miss the remainder of the season, but Sisler underwent electric treatments and returned five days later for a series against the Yankees. At the time, he had a 39-game hitting streak going, one shy of Cobb&#x27;s 1911 AL record and five shy of Willie Keeler&#x27;s 1897 MLB record. He had hits in his first two games returning from the injury before going hitless on September 18. Sisler&#x27;s 41 game hitting streak remained an AL record until Joe DiMaggio set the MLB record with his 56-game hitting streak in 1941.

Sisler later recounted the struggles of rushing his return. &quot;The arm was so badly crippled that I had to lift my gloved hand with my left hand in order to catch balls at first base. At bat, I was swinging with one hand.&quot; He batted .316 after returning from the injury. He had three hits, two runs scored, and two stolen bases on September 24 in a 7–4 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics. The Browns remained in the race until September 30, the second-to-last day of the season, when a Yankee win over the Red Sox clinched the pennant for New York. Sisler&#x27;s .420 batting average remains the third-highest of American and National League (NL) players in the 20th century, surpassed only by Nap Lajoie&#x27;s .426 in 1901 and Rogers Hornsby&#x27;s .424 in 1924. Sisler also led the AL in hits (246), runs (134), stolen bases (51), and triples (18). He was chosen as the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in the first year that an official league award was given. In 2011, Kostya Kennedy of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote that many baseball historians consider Sisler&#x27;s season among the best individual all-around single-season performances in baseball history. Jim Barrero of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asserted in 2000 that Sisler&#x27;s 257-hits record was largely overshadowed by Ruth&#x27;s 54 home runs that same year. &quot;Of course, Ruth&#x27;s obliteration of the home run record drew all the attention from fans and newspapermen, while Sisler&#x27;s mark was pushed to the side and perhaps left unappreciated during what was a golden age of pure hitters&quot;, Barrero wrote.

====Vision troubles (1923)====
A severe attack of sinusitis caused Sisler double vision in 1923. He had surgery to treat the condition on April 13, and received treatment from an eye specialist afterwards. By May, it was clear that the vision trouble was long-term, jeopardizing Sisler&#x27;s chances of ever playing again. As a result, the Browns acquired Dutch Schliebner to play first base for them that season. Sisler began attending games again in April, regularly sitting in the upper deck at Sportsman&#x27;s Park. During the year, he and many of his Browns teammates signed a petition to AL president Ban Johnson seeking to get Dave Danforth reinstated, after Johnson suspended Danforth 10 games for allegedly tampering with baseballs. Manager Lee Fohl refused to sign it and was fired days later. Sisler&#x27;s eye treatments concluded by the end of the year, and the Browns hoped he would be able to play again in 1924. Sisler ensured he would remain with them by accepting the managerial position after the 1923 season, his worries about its effect on his hitting now counterbalanced by the uncertainty surrounding his playing career. Most people were in favor of the move, and sportswriter Joe Vila wrote, &quot;Sisler, in the opinion of the sharps, is a born leader.&quot;

====Player-manager (1924–1926)====
Returning to play with the Browns at the beginning of 1924 spring training, Sisler batted .324 in the exhibition contests and was St. Louis&#x27;s starting first baseman on Opening Day. Sisler later recalled, &quot;I planned to get back in uniform for 1924. I just had to meet a ball with a good swing again, and then run. The doctors all said I&#x27;d never play again, but when you&#x27;re fighting for something that actually keeps you alive – well, the human will is all you need.&quot; Observers noticed that he had to squint to see the ball, and Sisler said in an interview that he was now more concerned with making contact with the ball, instead of hitting it between fielders. He batted .305 in 1924, nearly 100 points below his combined batting average for 1920–22. He also led AL first basemen with 23 errors. Though not as good as he had been before the vision trouble, Sisler had &quot;proven he could still play the game&quot; according to Huhn.
As the ballclub&#x27;s manager, Sisler asked his players for advice. &quot;He&#x27;s one of the fellows, but he&#x27;s the leader&quot;, said Ken Williams. He did not have a set bedtime or wake-up time for the ballclub, unlike several other MLB managers. Despite his &quot;player&#x27;s manager&quot; reputation, Sisler would still discipline his squad when necessary, as he proved in May when he fined Shocker for skipping and showing up late to several Browns games with no explanation. After a fifth-place finish in the eight-team AL in 1923, the Browns posted an identical 74–78 record in 1924, this time good for fourth in the league.

Sisler started the 1925 season by setting an MLB record with hits in his first 34 games of the year. Later in the season, he would have a 22-game hitting streak. Ruth said on May 10 that the Browns player was &quot;staging the greatest come-back ever known to baseball ... the league ought to strike a medal for iron nerve and give it to George. He has whipped the worst odds any ball player ever played against.&quot; Sisler had his fourth and final 100-RBI season, with 105 runs driven in, and he batted .345. Though these statistics were more impressive than ones that many Hall of Fame hitters would approach in their careers, Sisler later said, &quot;Oh, I know I hit .345 and got 228 hits [really 224] in 1925 but that never gave me much satisfaction. That isn&#x27;t what I call real good hitting.&quot; With a record under .500 on July 30, the Browns were never in close contention for the AL pennant, but they finished the year with an 82–71 record, good for third place in the league.

In 1926, the injury-plagued Browns lost their first five games along with 16 out of 19 in a May road trip. There were reports as early as May that Sisler&#x27;s managerial job was in jeopardy, and on June 1, St. Louis sportswriter J. Roy Stockton blamed the team&#x27;s struggles on Sisler&#x27;s easygoing attitude, saying that the Browns &quot;have taken advantage of his kindness&quot;. With the team struggling, Sisler saw his RBI production diminish. He struggled in August, batting .038 in his first seven games and going hitless in 17 consecutive at bats during that time. In 150 games, he had seven home runs and 71 RBIs. His .290 batting average was his lowest since he batted .285 as a rookie in 1915. The Browns struggled to a 62–92 seventh-place finish in 1926, and their .403 winning percentage was the franchise&#x27;s lowest since its 1916 season. Sisler was relieved of his managerial duties after the season, though he was retained as the Browns&#x27; first baseman.

====Last season with Browns (1927)====
Sisler batted .400 early in the 1927 season. On May 3, he had three hits and stole home in a 13–3 victory over the Cleveland Indians. In August, St. Louis sportswriter John E. Wray wrote that &quot;were it not for the surprising flash of Lou Gehrig, Sisler [batting .340] would have the first base championship of the American League wrapped up and tucked away.&quot; Defensively, he led AL first basemen in errors once again, with 24. However, he batted .327 with 201 hits, five home runs, and 97 RBIs, leading the AL in stolen bases for a fourth time with 27.

The Browns endured another losing season in 1927, and as early as July 26, owner Phil Ball announced that with the team losing money, it would be trading many of its star players. On December 14, Sisler was traded to the Senators for cash, reported as $15,000 in Washington and $25,000 in St. Louis.

===Washington Senators===
Washington&#x27;s first base job was not automatically Sisler&#x27;s, as the Senators also had Joe Judge, a popular player who had hit over .300 the previous year. Though he outhit Judge .363 to .205 in spring training, Sisler&#x27;s mobility was diminished, and Judge won the starting job. He made only two starts through Washington&#x27;s first 28 games before starting seven games in a row at first base or in left field from May 19 through 25, though this was to get other teams interested in acquiring him. On May 27, the Senators sold his contract to the Boston Braves for $7,500. In 20 games, Sisler had batted .245 with a mere two RBI and no stolen bases.

===Boston Braves===
Hornsby, who had starred for the NL&#x27;s Cardinals in Sportsman&#x27;s Park for many years, now managed the Braves, and after spearheading the Sisler acquisition, he installed the veteran as Boston&#x27;s everyday first baseman. Receiving a standing ovation from the Boston fans in his first game at Braves Field on May 29, he showed enough speed for an infield hit. Two days later, he hit a home run that bounced through the window of a bus passing the ballpark. Returning to Sportsman&#x27;s Park for a series against the Cardinals in July, he was honored with a flower basket, a silver tea service, and a letter from St. Louis mayor Victor J. Miller in a pregame presentation on July 7. In 118 games for Boston, Sisler had four home runs and 68 RBIs, also posting a .988 fielding percentage at first base. His .340 batting average put him percentage points ahead of Babe Herman for fourth in the NL.

After batting .222 through May 5, 1929, in one of his slowest-ever starts to a season, Sisler batted .400 in May. He had three-hit games against Pittsburgh and Chicago in August. Playing all 154 games, he batted .326, topping 200 hits (with 205) for the sixth time in his career and leading the Braves in nine offensive categories.

For the second time in three years, Sisler found his first base job threatened, as the Braves were interested in giving the position to Johnny Neun, a speedy player eight years younger than Sisler. The veteran did not start any of Boston&#x27;s first 19 games, but after the Braves suffered a seven-game losing streak, Sisler resumed his role as the everyday first baseman on May 11. He batted over .300 for the Braves but lost the role to Neun in September, partly because of a leg injury. On September 22, he played his last game for the Braves, going hitless in a pinch hit appearance during a 6–2 loss to the Cubs. In 116 games, he had a .309 batting average, 133 hits, three home runs, and 67 RBIs. However, he stole only seven bases, a sign that his speed was no longer the advantage it once had been. On December 13, the Braves released him.

===Minor leagues===
Unsigned by any MLB team in 1931, Sisler joined the minor league Rochester Red Wings of the International League. In the second game of a September 10 doubleheader, Sisler hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, clinching the International League pennant for Rochester. In 159 games, he batted .303 and struck out just 17 times out of 613 at bats.

In 1932, Sisler joined the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League as their player-manager. The team moved to Tyler, Texas, after a May 4 fire destroyed their ballpark. In 78 games, Sisler batted .287, going 38 consecutive games without striking out at one point. The team, however, struggled. After failing to catch an easy pop fly in midseason, Sisler resigned as manager and retired as an active player.

==Career statistics==
Sisler accumulated a .340 lifetime batting average over his 16 years in the major leagues and stole 375 bases during his career. He had 200 or more hits in six seasons. He hit over .300 thirteen times, including two seasons in which he hit over .400; 1926 was his only full season in which his average was less than .300. He stole over 25 bases in every year from 1916 through 1922, peaking with 51 the last year and leading the AL three times, plus a fourth in 1927. Sisler recorded 1 six-hit game, 4 five-hit games, and 60 four-hit games in his 15-year MLB career. He also had a 41-game hitting streak in 1922 and a 34-game hitting streak in 1925. The Browns moved to Baltimore in 1954 and became the Orioles; Sisler holds the franchise career records with 145 career triples and 351 stolen bases. He holds the franchise single season records for batting average (.420, 1922), on-base percentage (.467, 1922), hits (257, 1920), on-base plus slugging (1.082, 1920), and total bases (399, 1920). He also posted a career pitching record of 5–6 with a 2.35 earned run average in 24 career appearances.

==Managerial record==
==Legacy==

Sisler became one of the first entrants elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. Though voting had first been held in 1936, Sisler was part of the first group inducted when the Hall of Fame opened in June 1939. &quot;I think it&#x27;s the greatest honor the game can offer a retired player and it&#x27;s a satisfaction to know that your career is still remembered, years after you have hung up your glove&quot;, he said.

In his prime, Sisler would always try to control where his hits ended up. He batted flat-footed, using a stance that would enable him to hit either to left or to right field. Among baseball&#x27;s fastest runners, he stole 30 or more bases six times in his career, leading his league in stolen bases in four seasons. Though not a power hitter like Ruth, Sisler possessed a high batting average. He finished his career with a .340 mark, and he was the only AL player besides Cobb to twice hit over .400. In the peak of his career, his fielding earned him comparisons with Hal Chase, a former star blacklisted from baseball because of his gambling habits but considered one of baseball&#x27;s best fielders. Though he led his league in errors multiple times after his vision troubles, he was an excellent fielder before the ailment, and Lamberty refers to him as &quot;[a]rguably the first great first baseman of the twentieth century&quot;. A successful pitcher in college, he was seldom used in this position during his playing days (24 games with 12 starts), but he did post a 2.35 career ERA in 111 innings pitched and twice defeated Hall of Fame Senators pitcher Walter Johnson in complete game outings. Rickey said that Sisler &quot;was the smartest hitter who ever lived. He was a professional with the bat in his hands. He never stopped thinking ... In the field, he was the acme of grace and fluency.&quot;

During his career, Sisler drew comparisons to the leading players of his day, such as Cobb, Ruth, and Tris Speaker. According to Bill Lamberty of the Society for American Baseball Research, a contemporary writer claimed that Sisler possessed &quot;dazzling ability of the Cobbesque type. He is just as fast, showy, and sensational, very nearly if not quite as good as a natural hitter, as fast in speed of foot, an even better fielder, and gifted with a versatility Cobb himself might envy.&quot; Wray compared Sisler with Ruth before the two met for a series in 1920. &quot;Ruth stands out before the world as the more striking figure because of the spectacular nature of his blows [home runs]&quot;, Wray wrote, but he concluded that &quot;the cumulative effect of his [Sisler&#x27;s] efforts would probably surpass those of his rival.&quot; Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson wrote in 1922 that Sisler was &quot;every bit as valuable as Ruth, some people think more valuable&quot;, noticing also that Sisler was much humbler than his New York counterpart. Two years before, writer Floyd Bell had also described Sisler as &quot;modest, almost to a point of bashfulness, as far from egotism as a blushing debutante ... Shift the conversation to Sisler himself and he becomes a clam.&quot;

In 1999 editors at &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked Sisler 33rd on their list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. Outside of St. Louis&#x27; Busch Stadium, there is a statue of Sisler. He is also honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. While in St. Louis for the 2009 All-Star game, Ichiro Suzuki, who had broken Sisler&#x27;s hit record, visited the former Browns&#x27; grave site. Tarpon Springs, Florida honored George by naming the former spring training home of the St. Louis Browns &quot;Sisler Field&quot;. The playing surface is still in use by various local teams.

==Later life==
In 1933, Sisler partnered with Charles Nelson to open the Sisler-Nelson Sporting Goods Company in St. Louis. That same year, they formed the American Softball Association, building several softball fields with lights for night games around St. Louis to help stimulate interest in the game and the business. He also joined Hornsby for three winters as an instructor at the Ray Doan Baseball School in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1936 and 1937, Sisler served as a color commentator for Browns and Cardinals home games broadcast on KWK. Replacing Honus Wagner in 1938 as the commissioner of the National Baseball Congress, Sisler held the role for many years. He sold his interest in the sporting goods store in 1940 at a profit.

Sisler returned to working with MLB teams in December 1942, when Rickey, now the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, hired Sisler as a special assignment scout for the team. He would attend spring training with the parent club, then scout players at the high school, college, and semi-pro levels, mostly in Missouri and neighboring states, though he would sometimes be sent elsewhere to evaluate a particular player. Sisler was part of a scouting corps that Rickey assigned to evaluate black players, though the scouts thought they were looking for players to fill an all-black baseball team separate from MLB. After seeing the Kansas City Monarchs play in 1945, Sisler thought Jackie Robinson had the potential to be a star second baseman, though he was concerned about whether Robinson had enough arm strength to play shortstop. Rickey signed Robinson on October 23, and the ballplayer broke the MLB color barrier two years later on his way to a Hall of Fame career. In 1947, Sisler was reassigned to Brooklyn, where his duties expanded to evaluating Dodger prospects, meeting with the manager and coaches prior to and following each game, and watching games to help Dodger catchers learn what opposing hitters were likely to do. In 1949, Robinson spent hours working with Sisler in spring training, hoping to improve his performance at the plate. &quot;Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second, [and] how to shift my feet and hit to right. I&#x27;ll never stop being grateful to him,&quot; Robinson recalled. Sisler and Rickey worked with future Hall of Famer Duke Snider to teach the young Dodgers hitter to accurately judge the strike zone. Other hitters Sisler instructed and helped improve included Carl Furillo and Gil Hodges. In 1951, he signed future star pitcher Johnny Podres for the Dodgers.

After the Dodgers were edged out by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1950 NL pennant race, Rickey was dismissed by the team. Taking a job as the Pirates&#x27; general manager, he hired Sisler as his Scouting Supervisor, responsible for evaluating prospects within 100 miles of Pittsburgh. He held the position until 1955, when new GM Joe L. Brown relieved him from the role but retained him as a scout. Following the regular season, Sisler and other coaches would tutor top prospects at a post-season minor-league school. Acting on a tip from Clyde Sukeforth, Sisler journeyed to Montreal to see Roberto Clemente play, recommending that Rickey sign the future Hall of Famer. As he had in Brooklyn, Sisler helped his team&#x27;s players with their hitting. &quot;He ... told me I was taking my eye off the ball. He moved me back in the box so I could watch the ball better. He told me to hit the ball where it was pitched. Warned me not to pull it,&quot; recalled Frank Thomas, who would play for 16 seasons and hit 286 career home runs. &quot;Sisler teaches us to be ready for the fast ball and adjust our swing for the curve. If you&#x27;re looking for a curve and get a fast ball, you never hit it. But you can cut down on the speed of your swing to hit the curve,&quot; said 1960 NL MVP Dick Groat. In 1961, Sisler had Clemente switch to a heavier bat. Clemente won the league batting title that season.

Sisler&#x27;s duties with the Pirates changed again in 1963, when the ballclub assigned him to be a scout for the St. Louis area responsible for evaluating NL players. Sisler also instructed players in spring training and coached a fall instructional league team in Chandler, Arizona. Willie Stargell was one of the Chandler team&#x27;s alumni.

After spending eight days at St. Louis&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Sisler died in Richmond Heights, Missouri, on March 26, 1973, of kidney failure exacerbated by heart trouble. His death came two days after his 80th birthday. His funeral occurred in St. Louis a few days later, and his cremated remains were laid to rest at the Des Peres Presbyterian Church Cemetery.

==Personal life==
In 1913, Sisler met his future wife, Kathleen Charlotte Holznagle. Both were involved in Greek life at the University of Michigan. They were married on October 21, 1916. Sisler did not consume alcohol or tobacco, and he refrained from swearing. In the first years of his career, he attended a Presbyterian church. As he battled eye trouble in 1923, Browns part-owner Walter Fritsch suggested he &quot;look into&quot; Christian Science. Soon a strong believer in its power, Sisler had spiritual adviser Dr. John Randall Dunn accompany him to Browns spring training in 1924, when he made his comeback. Sisler discussed hitting in a 1934 pamphlet entitled &quot;The Knack of Batting&quot; and in a 1954 book entitled &quot;Sisler on Baseball: A Manual for Players and Coaches&quot;. Sportscaster Red Barber said in 1969 that the book was &quot;still the definitive book on hitting&quot;.

Sisler&#x27;s sons Dick and Dave were also major league players in the 1950s. George was a Dodgers scout in 1950 when Dick hit a game-winning home run against Brooklyn to clinch the pennant for the Phillies and eliminate the second-place Dodgers. Asked after the pennant-winning game how he felt when his son hit the home run, George replied, &quot;I felt awful and terrific at the same time.&quot; Another son, George Jr., served as a minor league executive and as the president of the International League. The Sislers had one other child, daughter Frances.

<text>A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus.
A host on a bus network is called a &quot;station&quot;. In a bus network, every station will receive all network traffic, and the traffic generated by each station has equal transmission priority. A bus network forms a single network segment and collision domain. In order for nodes to share the bus, they use a medium access control technology such as carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) or a bus master.

<text>The USS &quot;Astoria&quot; (SP-2005/AK-8) was a steel-hulled, coal-burning steam cargo ship of the United States Navy.

==Service history==
===In commercial service, 1902–1917===
The ship was constructed in 1902 by J. Blumer &amp; Co., Sunderland, England, as SS &quot;Burbo Bank&quot; for the Fenwick Shipping Co., Ltd., was acquired by Leonhardt &amp; Blumberg of Hamburg, Germany shortly before the beginning of World War I, and was renamed SS &quot;Frieda Leonhardt&quot;. After the outbreak of hostilities, she took refuge in Jacksonville, Florida, and remained there until the United States entered the war against Germany in the spring of 1917.

===Seized by the United States, 1917===
She was then seized by United States Customs officials and was turned over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB). Transferred to the Navy by an executive order dated 22 May 1917, the freighter was moved to Charleston, South Carolina, to be prepared in the navy yard there for naval service. Renamed &quot;Astoria&quot; (SP-2005), she completed conversion late in 1917 and was commissioned on 15 November 1917.

===US Navy service, 1917–1921===
Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, &quot;Astoria&quot; departed Charleston on 23 November for a voyage to Gulfport, Mississippi, and back; reentered Charleston on 19 December; and remained until the last day of the year when she got underway for Hampton Roads, Virginia. The ship loaded a cargo of Army supplies, put to sea on 26 January 1918, and reached the French coast early in February. On 15 February – while anchored in port at Brest, France – &quot;Astoria&quot; was rammed by the French ship SS &quot;La Drome&quot; and suffered damage which required several weeks of repairs before she could resume action.

On 10 May, the ship was assigned duty as a coal carrier for the Army. In that capacity, she shuttled between Cardiff, Wales, and the French ports of Brest, Saint-Nazaire, and La Pallice for the remainder of the war and into 1919. After a stop at Queenstown, Ireland, between 2 and 22 February, she got underway for the United States and operated along the east coast until April 1919 when she began one more round-trip voyage to France. Upon her return, she resumed cargo-carrying operations out of Norfolk and continued that role through the end of 1919. She stood out of Norfolk, on 5 January 1920, and steamed through the Panama Canal to the west coast. During her ten months of operations with the Pacific Fleet, she was classified AK-8 on 17 July 1920. On 11 November, the ship headed back toward the east coast.

===Decommissioning, sale, and later career===
&quot;Astoria&quot; was decommissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 20 April 1921; and she was sold on 20 December 1921 to Mr. Richard T. Green of Chelsea, Massachusetts. Thereafter, the ship remained active in merchant service – under the names &quot;Astoria&quot; and, later, &quot;Hartwelson&quot; – for more than two decades. As &quot;Astoria&quot;, she ran aground in Grays Harbor, Washington, on 2 May 1927 and was abandoned by her crew, but she later was refloated, repaired, and returned to service. On 5 May 1943, as &quot;Hartwelson&quot;, she ran aground on Bantam Rock, Sheepscot Bar, Maine, and foundered.

<text>(November 13, 1924 – November 13, 1994) was a Japanese biologist best known for introducing the neutral theory of molecular evolution in 1968. He became one of the most influential theoretical population geneticists. He is remembered in genetics for his innovative use of diffusion equations to calculate the probability of fixation of beneficial, deleterious, or neutral alleles. Combining theoretical population genetics with molecular evolution data, he also developed the neutral theory of molecular evolution in which genetic drift is the main force changing allele frequencies. James F. Crow, himself a renowned population geneticist, considered Kimura to be one of the two greatest evolutionary geneticists, along with Gustave Malécot, after the great trio of the modern synthesis, Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright.

Kimura was born on November 13, 1924, in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture. From an early age he was very interested in botany, though he also excelled at mathematics (teaching himself geometry and other maths during a lengthy convalescence due to food poisoning). After entering a selective high school in Nagoya, Kimura focused on plant morphology and cytology; he worked in the laboratory of M. Kumazawa studying the chromosome structure of lilies. With Kumazawa, he also discovered how to connect his interests in botany and mathematics: biometry

Due to World War II, Kimura left high school early to enter Kyoto Imperial University in 1944. On the advice of the prominent geneticist Hitoshi Kihara, Kimura entered the botany program rather than cytology because the former, in the Faculty of Science rather than Agriculture, allowed him to avoid military duty. He joined Kihara&#x27;s laboratory after the war, where he studied the introduction of foreign chromosomes into plants and learned the foundations of population genetics.

In 1949, Kimura joined the National Institute of Genetics in Mishima, Shizuoka. In 1953 he published his first population genetics paper (which would eventually be very influential), describing a &quot;stepping stone&quot; model for population structure that could treat more complex patterns of migration than Sewall Wright&#x27;s earlier &quot;island model&quot;. After meeting visiting American geneticist Duncan McDonald (part of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission), Kimura arranged to enter graduate school at Iowa State College in the summer 1953 to study with J. L. Lush.

Kimura soon found Iowa State College too restricting; he moved to the University of Wisconsin to work on stochastic models with James F. Crow and to join a strong intellectual community of like-minded geneticists, including Newton Morton and most significantly, Sewall Wright. Near the end of his graduate study, Kimura gave a paper at the 1955 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium; though few were able to understand it (both because of mathematical complexity and Kimura&#x27;s English pronunciation) it received strong praise from Wright and later J.B.S. Haldane.

His accomplishments at Wisconsin included a general model for genetic drift, which could accommodate multiple alleles, selection, migration, and mutations, as well as some work based on R.A. Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection. He also built on the work of Wright with the Fokker–Planck equation by introducing the Kolmogorov backward equation to population genetics, allowing the calculation of the probability of an allele to become fixed in a population. He received his PhD in 1956, before returning to Japan (where he would remain for the rest of his life, at the National Institute of Genetics).

Kimura worked on a wide spectrum of theoretical population genetics problems, many of them in collaboration with Takeo Maruyama. He introduced the &quot;infinite alleles&quot;, &quot;infinite sites&quot;, and &quot;stepwise&quot; models of mutation, all of which would be used widely as the field of molecular evolution grew alongside the number of available peptide and genetic sequences. The stepwise mutation model is a &quot;ladder model&quot; that can be applied to electrophoresis studies where homologous proteins differ by whole units of charge. An early statement of his approach was published in 1960, in his &quot;An Introduction to Population Genetics&quot;. He also contributed an important review article on the ongoing controversy over genetic load in 1961.

1968 marked a turning point in Kimura&#x27;s career. In that year he introduced the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the idea that, at the molecular level, the large majority of genetic change is neutral with respect to natural selection—making genetic drift a primary factor in evolution. The field of molecular biology was expanding rapidly, and there was growing tension between advocates of the expanding reductionist field and scientists in organismal biology, the traditional domain of evolution. The neutral theory was immediately controversial, receiving support from many molecular biologists and attracting opposition from many evolutionary biologists.

Kimura spent the rest of his life developing and defending the neutral theory. As James Crow put it, &quot;much of Kimura&#x27;s early work turned out to be pre-adapted for use in the quantitative study of neutral evolution&quot;. As new experimental techniques and genetic knowledge became available, Kimura expanded the scope of the neutral theory and created mathematical methods for testing it against the available evidence. Kimura produced a monograph on the neutral theory in 1983, &quot;The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution&quot;, and also worked to promote the theory through popular writings such as &quot;My Views on Evolution&quot;, a book that became a best-seller in Japan.
Though difficult to test against alternative selection-centered hypotheses, the neutral theory has become part of modern approaches to molecular evolution.

In 1992, Kimura received the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society, and the following year he was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.

Kimura suffered from progressive weakening caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis later in life. In an accidental fall at his home in Shizuoka, Japan, Kimura struck his head and died on November 13, 1994, of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was married to Hiroko Kimura. They had one child, a son, Akio, and a granddaughter, Hanako.

<doc id="645335" wikidata="Q6510183" url="?curid=645335" title="Diffusion equation">
<text>The diffusion equation is a parabolic partial differential equation. In physics, it describes the macroscopic behavior of many micro-particles in Brownian motion, resulting from the random movements and collisions of the particles (see Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion). In mathematics, it is related to Markov processes, such as random walks, and applied in many other fields, such as materials science, information theory, and biophysics. The diffusion equation is a special case of the convection–diffusion equation when bulk velocity is zero. It is equivalent to the heat equation under some circumstances.

== Statement ==

The equation is usually written as:
where is the density of the diffusing material at location and time and is the collective diffusion coefficient for density at location ; and represents the vector differential operator del. If the diffusion coefficient depends on the density then the equation is nonlinear, otherwise it is linear.

The equation above applies when the diffusion coefficient is isotropic; in the case of anisotropic diffusion, is a symmetric positive definite matrix, and the equation is written (for three dimensional diffusion) as:
The diffusion equation has numerous analytic solutions. 

If is constant, then the equation reduces to the following linear differential equation:
: formula_1
which is identical to the heat equation.

== Historical origin ==

The particle diffusion equation was originally derived by Adolf Fick in 1855.

== Derivation ==

The diffusion equation can be trivially derived from the continuity equation, which states that a change in density in any part of the system is due to inflow and outflow of material into and out of that part of the system. Effectively, no material is created or destroyed:
formula_2
where j is the flux of the diffusing material. The diffusion equation can be obtained easily from this when combined with the phenomenological Fick&#x27;s first law, which states that the flux of the diffusing material in any part of the system is proportional to the local density gradient:
formula_3

If drift must be taken into account, the Fokker–Planck equation provides an appropriate generalization.

== Discretization ==
The diffusion equation is continuous in both space and time. One may discretize space, time, or both space and time, which arise in application. Discretizing time alone just corresponds to taking time slices of the continuous system, and no new phenomena arise.
In discretizing space alone, the Green&#x27;s function becomes the discrete Gaussian kernel, rather than the continuous Gaussian kernel. In discretizing both time and space, one obtains the random walk.

== Discretization in image processing ==
The product rule is used to rewrite the anisotropic tensor diffusion equation, in standard discretization schemes, because direct discretization of the diffusion equation with only first order spatial central differences leads to checkerboard artifacts. The rewritten diffusion equation used in image filtering:
formula_4
where &quot;tr&quot; denotes the trace of the 2nd rank tensor, and superscript &quot;T&quot; denotes transpose, in which in image filtering &quot;D&quot;(&quot;ϕ&quot;, r) are symmetric matrices constructed from the eigenvectors of the image structure tensors. The spatial derivatives can then be approximated by two first order and a second order central finite differences. The resulting diffusion algorithm can be written as an image convolution with a varying kernel (stencil) of size 3 × 3 in 2D and 3 × 3 × 3 in 3D.

<text>Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town is a sequence of stories by Stephen Leacock, first published in 1912. It is generally considered to be one of the most enduring classics of Canadian humorous literature. The fictional setting for these stories is Mariposa, a small town on the shore of Lake Wissanotti. Although drawn from his experiences in Orillia, Ontario, Leacock notes: &quot;Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty of them. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels.&quot;

This work has remained popular for its universal appeal. Many of the characters, though modelled on townspeople of Orillia, are small town archetypes. Their shortcomings and weaknesses are presented in a humorous but affectionate way. Often, the narrator exaggerates the importance of the events in Mariposa compared to the rest of the world. For example, when there is a country-wide election, &quot;the town of Mariposa, was, of course, the storm centre and focus point of the whole turmoil.&quot;

The story of the steamboat &quot;Mariposa Belle&quot; sinking in Lake Wissanotti is one of the best-loved in the set. The apparent magnitude of this accident is lessened somewhat when it is revealed that the depth of the water is less than six feet. Men from the town come to the rescue in an un-seaworthy lifeboat which sinks beneath them just as they are pulled onto the steamer, and the narrator earnestly remarks that this was &quot;one of the smartest pieces of rescue work ever seen on the lake.&quot; It is widely believed that the &quot;Mariposa Belle&quot; disaster is inspired by the &quot;Enterprise&quot; disaster on July 31, 1903, in which she suffered a mechanical failure and sank at its wharf in Barrie, Canada.

==Selected list of characters==

The following characters are interwoven through the set of twelve stories of &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot;:
*Josh Smith, proprietor of Smith&#x27;s Hotel, one of the leading citizens of the town.
*Jefferson Thorpe, owner of the barber shop, who engages in mining speculations.
*Golgotha Gingham, the undertaker, to whom people are less interesting when still alive.
*Dean Rupert Drone, reverend of the &quot;Church of England Church&quot;, who has to deal with the debt from building a new church.
*Peter Pupkin, a bank teller who loves the Judge&#x27;s daughter.
*Zena Pepperleigh, Judge Pepperleigh&#x27;s daughter. She likes to read romantic stories.
*Dr. Gallagher, collector of Indian relics and student of Canadian history.
*Mr Hussell, journalist for the &quot;Mariposa Newspacket&quot;.
*Christie Johnson, captain of the &quot;Mariposa Belle&quot;.
*Henry Mullins, manager of the Mariposa Exchange Bank.
*Narrator, an unreliable narrator, whose descriptions of the town are biased or absurd.

Many characters are based on real-life people from Orillia, Ontario. Their names were only thinly-veiled in the original sketches that appeared as a serial in the &quot;Montreal Star&quot;. Out of an abundance of caution, Leacock changed many characters&#x27; names before the sketches were published together in book form.

==Publication==
The stories in the book were initially published as a sequence of short literary pieces serialized in the &quot;Montreal Daily Star&quot; from February 17 to June 22, 1912. Leacock reworked the series – by the means of additions, combinations, and divisions (but no deletions) – and assembled it as the book&#x27;s manuscript. The book was first published on August 9, 1912. Leacock corrected proof pages of the first edition of &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot; while in Paris.

In 1923, George Locke commented in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; that library students had chosen the book as one of a dozen &quot;[...] books of prose fiction would best represent the works of Canadian authors to readers who wish to know something of Canadian life&quot;. 

The book was used in tourist promotions for Orillia as proof of its civic pride for decades following publication.

==Television adaptations==
===1952 TV series===
In 1952, the book was adapted into a television series, &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot;, by CBC Television, the network&#x27;s first foray into Canadian-produced drama. The cast of the series included John Drainie as the Narrator, Paul Kligman as John Smith, Timothy Findley as Peter Pupkin, Eric House as Dean Drone, Peg Dixon as Liliane Drone and Robert Christie as Golgotha Gingham.

===2012 TV movie===
A second television adaptation premiered on CBC in 2012, and stars Gordon Pinsent and Jill Hennessy. This made-for-TV movie features two stories from the book, &quot;The Marine Excursions of the Knights of Pythias&quot; and &quot;The Hostelry of Mr. Smith&quot;, and was created to coincide with the book&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The stories are a mix of fact and fiction; drawing on details of Leacock&#x27;s own life and that of his literary creation.

==Learning resources==
At least two learning resources on &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot; have been created for teachers. In 1960, McClelland and Stewart created an educational edition for teachers, with an introduction and questions by D. H. Carr. In 2017, the Public Legal Education Association of Saskatchewan created a comprehensive learning guide for the book alongside an abridged newsletter that reconsiders the book.

<doc id="645344" wikidata="Q7749685" url="?curid=645344" title="The Major Transitions in Evolution">
<text>The Major Transitions in Evolution is a book written by John Maynard Smith and Eörs Szathmáry (Oxford University Press, 1995).

Maynard Smith and Szathmary authored a review article in &quot;Nature&quot;.

Maynard Smith and Szathmáry identified several properties common to the transitions:
# Smaller entities have often come about together to form larger entities, e.g. chromosomes, eukaryotes, sex multicellular colonies.
# Smaller entities often become differentiated as part of a larger entity, e.g. DNA-protein, organelles, anisogamy, tissues, castes
# The smaller entities are often unable to replicate in the absence of the larger entity, e.g. DNA, chromosomes, organelles, tissues, castes.
# The smaller entities can sometimes disrupt the development of the larger entity, e.g. meiotic drive (selfish non-Mendelian genes), parthenogenesis, cancers, coup d’états.
# New ways of transmitting information have arisen, e.g. DNA-protein, cell heredity, epigenesis, universal grammar.

As stated by the authors, this book was aimed at professional biologists and assumes considerable prior knowledge. They have also published a summary of their arguments in &quot;Nature&quot; as well as a presentation of their ideas for a general readership under the title &quot;The Origins of Life — From the Birth of Life to the Origins of Language&quot;. Two decades later, Eörs Szathmáry published an &quot;update&quot; of his thesis in the original book, and this update involved demoting &quot;sex&quot; from a major transition as well as promoting new transitions, such as the origins of plastids, to the list. The major transitions generally involve the formation of new levels of units of selection, consisting of ensembles of pre-existing entities. Therefore, the evolution of the major transitions can also be seen as the framework for studying the evolution of the levels of complexity in biology.

Their work has generated substantial interest and further research into major transitions, including a devoted issue of papers to the subject in 2016 in the journal &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&quot;. Additional suggestions to the transitions concept include the inclusion of viruses as playing a role as major catalysts for evolutionary transitions in two ways. One, parasite-host arms race often leads to the formation of complex structures and levels of complexity to combat the threat of viruses. Two, gene transfer from viruses and virus-like elements may contribute important genes for the emergence of higher levels of organization. Others have noted that the concept of transitions in macroevolutionary history focuses on increases in the levels of complexity, whereas macroevolutionary events can also proceed through simplifications which undo these hierarchical increases in complexity (e.g. multicellular organisms losing adherence genes and so transitioning into unicellular organisms, or the animal and plant lineages with degenerated organelles such as mitosomes). Furthermore, simplifications can also enable other macroevolutionary complexifications (e.g. the bacterial endosymbiont that simplified into the integrated mitochondrial organelle). Thus, incorporating simplification dynamics will help further elucidate the emergence of life&#x27;s lineages.

<doc id="645347" wikidata="Q1571756" url="?curid=645347" title="Chamber of Representatives of Colombia">
<text>The Chamber of Representatives (Spanish: &quot;Cámara de Representantes&quot;) is the lower house of the Congress of Colombia. It has 172 members elected to four-year terms.

==Electoral system==
According to the Colombian Constitution, the Chamber of Representatives, currently composed of 166 representatives serving four-year terms, is elected in territorial constituencies, special constituencies and an international constituency.

The departments (and the capital district of Bogotá D.C.) each form territorial electoral constituencies (&quot;circunscripciones territoriales&quot;). Each constituency has at least two members, and one more for every 365,000 inhabitants or fraction greater than 182,500 over and above the initial 365,000. For the legislative term 2014-2018, 161 of the Chamber&#x27;s 166 members were elected in territorial constituencies.

There are also three special constituencies, electing the remaining five members: one for Indigenous communities currently with one representative, one for Afro-Colombian communities (&quot;negritudes&quot;) currently with two representatives and one for Colombian citizens resident abroad currently with one representative. As a result of the 2015 constitutional reform, the number of seats allocated to Colombian citizens resident abroad was reduced to one, from 2018 onward, as an additional special seat will be created for the territorial constituency of Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina to represent the archipelago&#x27;s Raizal community.

Since 2014, the assignment of additional seats is based on the corresponding proportional increase of the national population in accordance with census results. If as a result of the above a territorial constituency should lose one or more seats, it keeps the number of seats to which it was entitled to on July 20, 2002.

For elections to the Chamber, political parties or other movements and groups run single lists, with a number of candidates not exceeding the total number of seats to be filled, although in constituencies with only two seats, party lists may include a third name. The current threshold for parties to win seats in a territorial constituency is 50% of the electoral quotient (total votes divided by total seats) in constituencies returning more than two members, and 30% of the electoral quotient in constituencies returning two members. Seats are then distributed using the distributing number, or &quot;cifra repartidora&quot;. This number is obtained by successively dividing the number of votes received by each list by one, two, three and so forth, and placing the results in descending order until the total number of results equal to the number of seats to be filled. The lowest resulting number is called the distributing number (&quot;cifra repartidora&quot;). Each list shall obtain the number of seats that corresponds to the number of times the distributing number is contained in the total number of its votes.

Parties may run a closed list, with the order of candidates pre-determined, or opt for preferential voting (open list), where the position of candidates on the list is reordered based on the individual preference votes of the voters. In congressional elections, voters choosing a party running a closed list only vote for the party list; voters who choose a party running an open list may indicate their candidate of preference among the names displayed on the ballot, if the voter does not indicate a preference and only votes for the party, the vote is valid for purposes of the threshold but not for reordering the list based on preferential votes.

===Current seat distribution===
, the number of seats is still based on the 1985 census.
==Eligibility==
To be a representative, a person must be a Colombian citizen (by birth or naturalization) over the age of 25 at the time of the election.

There are general rules of ineligibility and incompatibility which apply to both houses of Congress, explained here. In addition, general rules on the replacement and non-replacement of members depending on different circumstances also apply to both houses of Congress.

==Exclusive powers of the House==
# Elect the Ombudsman.
# Examine and finalize the general budgetary and treasury account presented to it by the Comptroller General.
# Bring charges to the Senate, at the request of the investigation and accusation commission, for the impeachment of the President (or whoever replaces them) and members of the &quot;Comisión de Aforados&quot;.
# Take cognizance of complaints and grievances presented by the Attorney General or by individuals against the aforementioned officials and, if valid, to bring charges on that basis before the Senate.
# Request the aid of other authorities to pursue the investigations.

===Judicial powers===
Until the 2015 constitutional reform, the investigation and accusation commission (Comisión de Investigación y Acusación) of the House of Representatives was recommending to the plenary the indictment of the President, Constitutional Court justices, Supreme Court justices, Superior Council of the Judiciary members, Council of State justices and the Attorney General. These senior officials of the State were said to benefit from a &quot;constitutional fuero&quot;, first enshrined in the 1886 Constitution and kept by the 1991 Constitution, although cabinet ministers lost their special constitutional protection in 1992.

The House&#x27;s accusation commission had been very criticized over the years, said to grant immunity to any senior official accused of corruption or wrongdoing. Between 1886 and 2014, only one of Colombia&#x27;s 40 presidents, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, was charged and sentenced by Congress in 1959 (after the end of his term), and that ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court seven years later. Between 1992 and 2014, the accusations commission received a total of 3,496 complaints, of which 56% were closed and 44% still pending. No case resulted in impeachment, and in fact only one case ever made its way to the floor of the House, that of President Ernesto Samper for the Proceso 8000.

===Comisión de Aforados===
The government&#x27;s constitutional reform in 2015 stripped the accusations commission of most of its power and restricted the existing &quot;fuero constitucional&quot; to the President. In its stead, the 2015 reform created the &quot;Comisión de Aforados&quot;, which will investigate and indict the aforementioned judges and Attorney General, even if they may have ceased to exercise their functions. The commission will be made up of five members elected by a joint session of Congress for individual eight-year terms, from lists sent by the Council of Judicial Government and elaborated through a public competition. The eligibility, ineligibility and incompatibility rules for the commission will be the same as for members of the Supreme Court of Justice.

In the case of investigations for unworthiness to serve for misconduct, the new commission shall present its charges, when necessary, to the House of Representatives, which will only be able to suspend or remove the accused from office. The House decision can be appealed to the Senate, which holds the final word. In such cases, the commission will have 60 days to present an accusation and 30 days to decide. In the case of investigations for other crimes, the commission shall present charges to the Supreme Court of Justice for further prosecution.

The new commission will be formed after a transitional period of one year, during which the accusations commission retains its original responsibilities.

==Elections==
The most recent parliamentary election in Colombia took place on 13 March 2022. For elections before that, see the below table:

<text>Argonauta argo, also known as the greater argonaut, is a species of pelagic octopus belonging to the genus &quot;Argonauta&quot;. The Chinese name for this species translates as &quot;white sea-horse&#x27;s nest&quot;.

&quot;A. argo&quot; was the first argonaut species to be described and is consequently the type species of the genus. The type specimen of &quot;A. argo&quot; was collected in the Mediterranean Sea and is deposited at the Linnean Society of London.

==Description==
&quot;A. argo&quot; is the largest species in the genus and also produces the largest eggcase. Live animals have a characteristic blue sheen on the first arm pair and around the eyes. The eggcase is characterised by two rows of small, sharp tubercles running along a narrow keel, smooth ribs across the walls of the shell, and a thickening along the shell aperture, which forms distinct protrusions or &#x27;horns&#x27; on either side. &quot;Argonauta cygnus&quot; was described based on a shell which lacked these protrusions, although it is now considered a junior synonym of &quot;A. argo&quot;. The greatest recorded size of an &quot;A. argo&quot; eggcase is 300 mm.

A damaged beak of a female &quot;A. argo&quot; (ML = 40.0 mm; caught at ), measuring 4.3 mm in hood length and 7.8 mm in crest length, is mentioned in &quot;A Handbook for the Identification of Cephalopod Beaks&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;A. argo&quot; is cosmopolitan, occurring in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. A dwarf form exists in the Mediterranean Sea, which was described as &quot;Argonauta argo mediterranea&quot; , although this taxon is now regarded as invalid.

==Biology==
The female of the species, like all argonauts, creates a paper-thin eggcase that coils around the octopus much like the way a nautilus lives in its shell, hence the name paper nautilus.

&quot;A. argo&quot; is thought to feed primarily on pelagic molluscs. The species is preyed on by numerous predators. It has been reported in the stomach contents of &quot;Alepisaurus ferox&quot; from the south-western Pacific.
Males of this species reach sexual maturity at a mantle length (ML) of 8 mm. Females mature at about double the size of &quot;Argonauta bottgeri&quot; and &quot;Argonauta hians&quot;. They begin to secrete an eggcase at 6.5–7.0 mm ML. Eggs are usually laid when females reach 14–15 mm ML, although the size at which this takes place differs across the animal&#x27;s range. A small &quot;A. argo&quot; residing in an 88 mm long eggcase was estimated to be carrying 48,800 embryos. Females grow to 100 mm ML, while males do not exceed 20 mm ML.

In the open ocean, &quot;A. argo&quot; has been observed attached to jellyfish. This behaviour has been known for a long time, although little was understood about the relationship prior to the work of Heeger &quot;et al.&quot; in 1992. In &quot;Predation on jellyfish by the cephalopod &quot;Argonauta argo&quot;&quot;, Heeger &quot;et al.&quot; describe their observations of a female &quot;A. argo&quot; found atop a host jellyfish. The argonaut was seen holding on to the aboral (exumbrellar) surface of the jellyfish using its lateral and ventral arms. The authors found that about half of the animal&#x27;s aboral surface was damaged and large pieces of mesoglea were missing, presumably removed by the argonaut. Additionally, two holes, apparently bite marks, were found in the center of this area with channels leading from these holes into the gastral cavity of the jellyfish. The argonaut presumably used these channels to suck food particles from the gastral cavity. Heeger &quot;et al.&quot; suggested that &quot;the association provided shelter or camouflage for the argonaut&quot;.

Observations of captive &quot;A. argo&quot; females suggest that the expanded webs of the dorsal arms may aid the animal in feeding. Mark Norman mentions, &quot;when food was touched against the spread webs, an arm shot out of the shell in a sweeping action, grabbing the prey&quot;. Argonauts are not thought to actively hunt, but employ this method to catch animals that bump into them in the open ocean.

&quot;A. argo&quot; is occasionally involved in mass strandings along the South African and southern Australian coastlines. The strandings are seasonal and generally occur between April and August, towards the end of the animals&#x27; spawning season.

==Culture==
In Japanese, this species is called &quot;Aoi-gai&quot; (kanji: 葵貝, Katakana: アオイガイ), which means &quot;Shell of Aoi&quot; (not &quot;Malva&quot; but &quot;Asarum caulescens&quot;). Japanese have compared two eggcases of argonauts lapped each other to a leaf of &quot;Asarum caulescens&quot;. Another name is &quot;Kaidako&quot; (kanji: 貝蛸 or 貝鮹, Katakana: カイダコ), which means &quot;Shell Octopus&quot;.

<doc id="645356" wikidata="Q588672" url="?curid=645356" title="Hammadid dynasty">
<text>The Hammadid dynasty (), also known as the Hammadid Emirate or the Kingdom of Bejaia, was a medieval Islamic kingdom in the central Maghreb, encompassing what is now Algeria. It was established at the beginning of the 11th century when Hammad ibn Buluggin declared himself emir, thus splitting the Zirid domains into two separate dynasties. Under the reign of Emir Al Nasir, the emirate briefly became the most important state in the Maghreb, and reached its greatest territorial extent, stretching from Tlemcen in the west to Tunis in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the desert oasis of Ouargla and Oued Righ in the south. While they briefly controlled the principality of Fez in the west and cities like Sfax, Kairouan, Laribus, and Tripoli to the east.

At first, Hammad built a fortified city that would serve as the capital for his newly declared kingdom. Later, upon the arrival of the Arabic Banu Hilal tribes, the capital would be replaced by another city, newly built by Emir Al Nasir ibn Alnas, called &quot;Al-Nāsiriyyah&quot; (from ) and later renamed to Bejaia; it was the official capital of the Emirate by 1090 during the rule of Al-Mansur. Both cities grew to become among the largest and most prosperous centers of the Maghreb, with Bejaia housing more than 100,000 inhabitants. The Hammadids subsequently clashed with the Almoravids in the west and their cousins the Zirids in the east. The latter weakened with the rise of the prominent Normans in Sicily, who also confronted the Hammadids for the domination of Ifriqiya (now Tunisia). However, the Hammadids faced another challenge on their western borders with the growing force of the Almohad Caliphate, and their emirate was finally annexed by the Almohads in 1152 after a brief clash with them.

==History==
=== Establishment ===

In 987 and 989, al-Mansur ibn Buluggin, the emir of the Berber Zirid dynasty, appointed his uncle Hammad ibn Buluggin as governor of Ashir and western Zirid lands. Hammad subsequently defended the territory against Zenata incursions and was granted additional lands by al-Mansur&#x27;s successor Badis ibn Mansur. In 1007 and 1008, forces under Hammad left Ashir and built a new citadel-capital, Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad (also called &quot;Al Qal&#x27;a of Beni Hammad&quot;), in M&#x27;Sila Province in the Hodna Mountains; a thriving city sprang up around the fortress.

In 1014, Hammad declared his independence from Zirid suzerainty and switched his spiritual allegiance from the Shi&#x27;a Fatimid caliphs to the Sunni Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad. The Zirids failed to quash the rebellion and recognized Hammadid legitimacy in 1017, in a peace with al-Mu&#x27;izz that was sealed by Hammad&#x27;s son and successor Qaid ibn Hammad (). The peace was further sealed by marriage, with al-Mu&#x27;izz&#x27;s sister marrying one of Hammad&#x27;s sons. According to historian Hady Roger Idris, it appears that the Hammadids agreed to recognize Fatimid suzerainty again at this time, but at some later point in his reign, perhaps around the same time as the Zirids did in the 1040s, Qa&#x27;id ibn Hammad repudiated Fatimid suzerainty again.

In 1039, Qaid ibn Hammad was attacked by Hammama, the ruler of Fes, but Hammama soon returned to Fez, requested peace, and declared his submission to the Hammadids.

Al-Mu&#x27;izz subsequently also broke with the Fatimids and changed his allegiance to the Abbasids. The Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir, sent Bedouin Arab allies, the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, into a mass migration and invasion of the lands in what is now Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria, culminating in al-Mu&#x27;izz&#x27;s defeat in 1053 and the subsequent reduction of the Zirids to a small, insignificant territory based in Mahdia. Amidst the chaos, the Hammadids reverted their allegiance to the Fatimids and managed to negotiate an alliance with the Bedouin tribes.

Although the Hammadids and Zirids entered into an agreement in 1077 in which Zirid ruler Tamim&#x27;s daughter married into the Hammadids, this did not end the rivalry between the dynasties. A common pattern was for Hammadids and Zirids to support &quot;rival coalitions of Arab tribes to fight their proxy wars.&quot; The Hammidid–Zirid rivalry also influenced the choice of which caliph to recognize; historian Amar S. Baadj writes, &quot;It would appear that the principle which the Hammadids followed in the course of their relations with Baghdad and Cairo was that of opposing the Zirids. Whenever the Zirids recognized one of two rival caliphs, the Hammadids would declare their submission to the other.&quot;

=== Apogee ===
Buluggin ibn Muhammad (r. 1055–1062), a subsequent Hammadid ruler, invaded northern Morocco in 1062 and briefly took Fez for a few months, but was then assassinated by his paternal cousin An-Nasir ibn Alnas, who succeeded him as emir. The Hammadid dynasty peaked during al-Nasir&#x27;s reign. Under his reign the Hammadids established their control across large parts of the Maghreb. Al-Nasir captured Constantine and Algiers, then established Hammadid influence far to the east in Sfax, where the local ruler acknowledged Hammadid suzerainty, as well as in Susa and Tripoli. At the request of local &quot;shaykh&quot;s, he was also able to install a loyal governor in Tunis until 1067. Between 1067 and 1072 he built Béjaïa, developing it from a small fishing village into a large, fortified town and port. The Hammadids also expanded south deep into the Sahara, with Ouargla forming the southernmost city of their territory. They briefly extended their authority further to the Oued Mya.

In the 11th century, the Hammadids came under increasing pressure from the Banu Hilal, who had settled in the Plains of Constantine and increasingly threatened Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad. While initially allied to the Bedouins, the Hammadids later became their puppets, allocating half of their harvest yields to them and buying off tribesmen in order to secure the safety of trade routes. Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad was eventually eclipsed by Béjaïa. In 1090, with the Banu Hilal menace rising, the Hammadids moved their capital to Béjaïa, yielding their southern territories to the Hilalians. The Hammadids maintained control of a small but prosperous coastal territory between Ténès and El Kala. E.J. Brill&#x27;s &quot;First Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; (1927) states that the Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad &quot;was not completely abandoned by al-Mansur and he even embellished it with a number of palaces. The Hammadid kingdom had therefore at this point two capitals joined by a royal road.&quot; Renamed al-Nasiriya to honor the emir, Béjaïa developed into a sophisticated trading city; under al-Nasir and his son and successor al-Mansur ibn Nasir, large gardens, palaces, a Great Mosque, and other landmarks were constructed in the town.

An-Nasir corresponded with Pope Gregory VII and expanded commercial opportunities for Italian traders in Béjaïa. The city then flourished as a trading port and a prominent intellectual centre where even Abu Madyan and the Andalusian Shaykh Abu Ali Hassan bin Ali Muhammad taught. Leonardo Fibonacci had also studied in Béjaïa; his father was appointed as collector of customs in Béjaïa and brought Leonardo with him. In Béjaïa Fibonacci was introduced to the Arabic numerical system and computational method; he later introduced this numerical system to Europe. He was also introduced to a book of algebra written by al-Khwarizmi.

=== Decline ===
In 1103–1104 the Hammadids defeated the Almoravids and took control of Tlemcen. During the reign of al-Mansur&#x27;s son Abd al-Aziz ibn Mansur (r. 1105–1121), Béjaïa had about 100,000 people, and the Hammadids consolidated their power in the city. The dynasty suffered a decline after this point; efforts to develop more sea power in the Mediterranean were foiled by the Normans, who by the 12th century had conquered Sicily and had also occupied a number of settlements on the coast of Tunisia and Algeria. However, Abd al-Aziz did expel the Hilalians from Hodna and capture Jerba.

The last dynastic emir was Yahya ibn Abd al-Aziz (r. 1121–1152). Yahya repulsed Bedouin incursions and subdued uprisings by Berber clans, but during his reign the Genoese also raided Béjaïa (1136), and the Kingdom of Sicily occupied the settlement of Djidjelli and destroyed a pleasure palace that had been built there. Tunis, whose Khurasanid rulers had previously vacillated between recognizing Zirid and Hammadid authority, was annexed in 1128 and controlled by Hammadid governors until 1148.

Yahya tried to establish good relations with the Fatimids in the early 1140s, but ultimately he recognized the Abbasids instead and minted coins in al-Muqtafi&#x27;s name. In 1144 and 1145, he dispatched Hammadid forces to join the Almoravids in fighting, unsuccessfully, the Berber Almohads led by Abd al-Mu&#x27;min.

In 1145, Abd al-Mu&#x27;min conquered Tlemcen and Oran. In 1151, he marched against the Hammadids. The Almohads took Algiers in 1152 and captured Béjaïa later the same year, crushing Hammadid forces at the gates of the city. This marked a major military triumph for Abd al-Mu&#x27;min. Yahya fled to Constantine, but surrendered several months later. He died in comfortable exile in Salé, Morocco, in 1163. Abd al-Mu&#x27;min enslaved the women and children of Hammadid loyalists who had fought against him, but did not sack Béjaïa because the city had surrendered.

Some 30 years after the collapse of the Hammadids, the dynasty had a brief revival in 1184, when &#x27;Ali ibn Ghaniya—a member of the Banu Ghaniya branch of the Almoravid dynasty, which had established a kingdom in the Balearic Islands—seized control of Béjaïa, recruited a mixed force of &quot;dispossessed Hammadids, Sanhaja Berbers, and Hilalian tribes&quot; opposed to Almohad rule, and quickly captured Algiers, Miliana, Ashir, and al Qal&#x27;a, with the goal of establishing a new Almoravid polity in the Maghreb. Less than a year later, the Almohad had recaptured all the towns. The Banu Ghaniya did retain, through the end of the Almohad period, some influence in Tripolitania, southern Tunisia, and the Algerian plains, where Hammadid loyalists numbered among their allies.

== Territories ==

The Hammadid domain stretched across the entirety of the Central Maghreb, comprising the northern expanse of what is now Algeria. At its establishment during Hammad&#x27;s reign, a pact was forged with his cousin Badis, stipulating that Hammad would retain authority over a substantial swath of the Central Maghreb (Algeria). This encompassed pivotal cities such as M&#x27;sila, Achir, and Tahert, alongside the territories of Tobna and Zab, as well as any lands annexed through his conquests. The kingdom&#x27;s territories quickly expanded. Following Hammad&#x27;s death, his son Sultan El Qaid ascended to power, and in 1038, a war erupted against the ruler of Fes. The latter swiftly backtracked and declared submission to the Hammadids. Under the reign of Sultan Buluggin ibn Muhammad campaigns were conducted in the west to subdue the Zenata tribes. He defeated the Zenata and entered Tlemcen in 1058.
At the same time, the governor of Biskra revolted against the Hammadids, but the rebellion was swiftly suppressed, and he was replaced. In 1062, Bologhine learned that the Almoravids had seized control of the Maghreb Al Aqsa (Morocco) and launched a campaign into Morocco, pushing back the Almoravids into the desert. He was assassinated by his successor on his return journey near Tessala.

Under the reign of Al Nacer (1062–1089) the kingdom experienced the peak of its territorial expansion. The influence of the Hammadids extended into Ifriqiya (Tunisia), as the governors of Sfax and Tunis, to whom governance was entrusted to the Banu Khurasan, submitted to Al Nacer. The people of Castilia (Tozeur) were notably brought under Hammadid rule. Shortly after the submission of these cities, Sultan Al Nacer conquered the city of Laribus, near Kef, in 1066 before entering Qayrawan, although the latter quickly emancipated itself from Hammadid influence. The cities of Sousse and Tripoli also submitted to Al Nacer. He also conducted a southern expedition, during which he expelled the Ibadi from Sedrata and ended a revolt in Ouargla by replacing its governor. His successor Al Mansur later fought the Almoravids in the west, who continued to raid Hammadid territories. He gathered over 20,000 fighters and marched on Tlemcen, which, after a victorious battle against the armies of Ibn Tachufin, led to an agreement where the boundary between the two kingdoms was set at Tlemcen. In the eastern part of the kingdom, a rebellion broke out but was swiftly quelled by Al Mansour, who managed to recapture Bone from the rebels. Few territorial changes occurred after the death of Sultan Al Mansour, notable among them being the capture of the island of Djerba by the Hammadid fleet under the reign of Abd Al Aziz, as well as the reintegration of the Banu Khurasan of Tunis into the Hammadid kingdom. During the rule of the final monarch, Yahya, in the eastern regions, according to the author of &quot;Sahib Al Majam&quot; (from ), the lands of the Hammadid Sultan Yahya extended to the plains of Sig near Oran, marking the boundary between the Hammadids and the Almoravids.
== Administration ==

The governmental structure represented an Islamic absolute monarchy, where the head of state held the title of Emir or Sultan and the governance of the emirate was exclusively within the Hammadid dynasty. They did recognize the spiritual authority of the Fatimid Caliphate at first until the arrival of the Banu Hilal tribes, and then the Abbasid Caliphate at different times. The &quot;Qada&quot; (from ) or Jurisdiction was separated from the administration and derived its rulings and legislative texts from the Maliki school of thought, which was prevalent among the people of the Maghreb and Al-Andalus. Arabic was the official language in the jurisdiction. Each city had a judge appointed by the Hammadid Emirs who was responsible for the affairs of Muslims, including complaints and other matters.

Initially, the Hammadid emirs personally oversaw the administration of the emirate, later delegating this responsibility to viziers based in the capital, mostly not from the Hammadid dynasty. They were given various tasks that included suppressing rebellions such as the Biskra rebellion during Bouloughin&#x27;s reign and handling diplomatic correspondence with other kingdoms, particularly during Emir El Nacer&#x27;s time. They were also tasked with managing both internal and external affairs. The &quot;Banu Hamdoune&quot; (from ) family wielded significant influence in the kingdom since Emir Badis&#x27; reign. Among them, &quot;Mimoun ibn Hamdoune&quot; served as vizier during the tenure of the last Hammadid Emir Yahya, whose authority grew as the Emir focused on hunting and entertainment. The Hammadid central administration included the &quot;Diwan al-Insha&quot; (from ), headed by a secretary, whose importance lies in drafting treaties and agreements. Next to the &quot;Diwan al-Insha&quot;, the Hammadids had the &quot;Diwan al-Bareed&quot; (from ), as the emir needed to correspond with other sultans, kings, and caliphs. The communication system was advanced during the era of the emirate, and mountain fire signals were built, as reflective mirrors were installed in lighthouses to reflect lights visible from a long distance. Thus, the nearby centers received their signals, and all centers transmitted them accordingly. They could have also used carrier pigeons like the Zirids.

Regarding the administration of the kingdom&#x27;s territories, most Umal (from &quot;Umal&quot;) (governors) were from the royal family, with their number fluctuating depending on the Sultan. Each city had its governor appointed by the Hammadid Sultan. Cities like Algiers, Bône, Constantine, Hamza, Achir, and Jijel each had an assigned governor. At its peak under the reign of Al Nacer, the Sultan appointed his brother &quot;Kbab&quot;, installed in Miliana, to govern the western territories. He also tasked the Banu Wemanou, a Zenata tribe located near Relizane, with overseeing the western territories of the kingdom. His second brother &quot;Ruman&quot; was assigned the governorship of Hamza (Bouira). The city of Constantine was given to his third brother &quot;Balbar&quot;, and N&#x27;Gaous to his fourth brother &quot;Khazar&quot;. He also entrusted his son &quot;Ibn el Alaa&quot; with the governance of Algiers and Mers el Dejaj while his other son &quot;Yusuf&quot; with that of Achir. Alongside these provinces, there were regions within the kingdom whose governance was assigned to other emirs, such as the region of Tozeur, which was given by Al Nacer to &quot;Yusuf ibn Makhluf&quot;. During this period, Tunis was under the governance of the Banu Khurasan, and Biskra under the Banu Ruman and later the Banu Sindi, both subject to Sultan Al Nacer. The city of Sfax was assigned to Hammu Ibn Malil. Al Nacer also had a governor in Ouargla whose name is not known.

==Art and architecture==
=== Architecture ===

Qal&#x27;at Beni Hammad, the dynasty&#x27;s capital, was described by Al-Bakri in the 11th century as a large and powerful military stronghold and a centre of commerce that attracted caravans from all over the Maghreb, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and the Hejaz. 14th-century Arab historian and philosopher Ibn Khaldun noted that the abundance of travellers was due to the wealth of resources offered to those interested in sciences, commerce and arts. The Qal&#x27;at attracted poets, sages and theologians. It was filled with various richly decorated palaces, caravanserai, gardens and what remained the largest mosque built in North Africa until the twentieth century. The art and architecture of the Hammadids influenced that of the Arabs, Almohads, Almoravids and Normans.

Hammadid emirs constructed five palaces, most of which are now destroyed. The keep of the Palace of the Fanal (&quot;Qasr al-Manar&quot;), however, survives to this day. A minaret, in height, is the only remaining part of the ruined Great Mosque; the structure bears some resemblance to Seville&#x27;s Giralda. The Hammadid mosque is said to have been the largest mosque constructed in North Africa prior to the twentieth century; it has the typical Maghreb-style square minaret. Architecture in Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad featured adornments of &quot;porcelain mosaics of many-colored faience, sculpted panels and plaster, enameled terra-cotta stalactites; building and pottery ornamentation consisted of geometric designs and stylized floral motifs.&quot;

Ibn Hamdis wrote two different poems describing one of the Hammadid palaces which he described as having interior courts of marble that looked as if they had been carpeted with crystal, and he observed that the grounds looked as if they were strewn with fine pearls. His description mentions that the palace had a pool that was bordered by marble lions with water streaming from their mouths; these lions were likely similar to those of the Alhambra.

In the Qal&#x27;at Beni Hammad fragments of stucco were discovered from the Qasr al-Salam and the Qasr al-Manar which may be the oldest fragments of &quot;muqarnas&quot; in the Western Islamic world, dating back to the 11th or 12th century. According to Lucien Golvin the fragments of the muqarnas semi-dome at the Qasr al-Salam are the oldest documented remains of a true &quot;muqarnas&quot; vault in the Islamic world. However, other scholars of Islamic architecture have questioned or rejected the dating of these fragments or their identification as true &quot;muqarnas&quot;.

Furthermore, the Qal&#x27;at buildings are considered to be documented antecedents and precursors to certain developments in Western Islamic art in the 12th century. Plaster capitals that were found at the Qal&#x27;at were composed of smooth leaves recurved in their upper part, considered to be an antecedent to the common Almoravid and Almohad forms which are seen in the Great Mosque of Tlemcen or in Tinmel. The framework of a marble basin and a grey marble fragment document the use of multifoil arches with spiral-form impost decoration. The use of this motif at the Qal&#x27;at subsequently spread during the times of the Almoravids and became universal in Almohad buildings. The square rooms surrounded by rampant barrel vaults in the Qasr al-Manar have been compared to the Almohad minarets and the Torre Pisana in Palermo which it predates. The Hammadid palaces are also noted to contain the first or one of the first documented use of shadirwan.

=== Art ===
The excavations in the Qal&#x27;at Beni Hammad also discovered the first reference corpus of Islamic ceramics. The production of ceramics in Al-Andalus during the taifa and Almoravid periods reflect a strong and direct Hammadid influence. The technique of luster-painting on pottery was passed from al Qal-at to Béjaïa to Malaga, and black painted and incised earthenware objects as well as bronze sculptures from the Zirids most likely influenced similar objects in Andalusia. Ceramic architectural decorations had never played such a large role in the Islamic world until the Hammadids, and from there it subsequently spread to Al-Andalus and Morocco where it became a hallmark for the architecture of these countries, and it also spread throughout Europe.

Luster-painted and glazed ceramic decoration in a wide variety of shapes and forms were a feature in the Islamic architecture of Hammadid-era Béjaïa. Al-Nasir reputedly negotiated with Pope Gregory VII for the services of Italian masons and other skilled craftsmen for the construction of Béjaïa. Although Béjaïa is mostly in ruins, a large sea gate reportedly survives. The Bab al-Bahr (gate of the sea) was built during an-Nasirs reign, along with five other gates, to protect the town. It is now a ruin consisted of a pointed arch constructed with solid bricks. The Bab al-Bunud was also built in Béjaïa during an-Nasirs reign with hexagonal towers and two ogival-arch gates.

In Béjaïa drawings of a facade of two palaces with ground plans by one of the Hammadids have been preserved and provide an insight into palatial architecture of the time period of the Hammadids. The first palace consisted of a huge domed hall flanked by smaller domed towers and chambers. The second palace, called al-Kukab, as said to have been where the Bordj Moussa is today. al-Kukab consisted of a large centred hall with a gabled roof flanked by side aisles and two small towers.

The Great Mosque of Constantine was originally constructed by the Hammadids in the 12th century and was built on the ruins of a Roman temple.

<text>The republics are one type of federal subject of the Russian Federation.
21republics are internationally recognized as part of Russia; another is under its de facto control. The original republics were created as nation states for ethnic minorities. The indigenous ethnicity that gives its name to the republic is called the &quot;titular nationality&quot;. However, due to centuries of Russian migration, a titular nationality may not be a majority of its republic&#x27;s population. By 2017, the autonomous status of all republics was formally abolished, making the republics politically equivalent to the other federal subjects of Russia.

Formed in the early 20th century by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks after the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, republics were intended to be nominally independent regions of Soviet Russia with the right to self-determination. Lenin&#x27;s conciliatory stance towards Russia&#x27;s minorities made them allies in the Russian Civil War and with the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922 the regions became autonomous republics, albeit subordinate to a union republic. While officially autonomous, the autonomies of these administrative units varied throughout the history of the Soviet Union but largely remained under the control of the central government. The 1980s saw an increase in the demand of autonomy as the Soviet Union began large scale reforms of its centralized system. In 1990, most of the autonomous republics declared their sovereignty. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and Russia became independent. The current republics were established with the signing of the Federation Treaty in 1992, which gave them substantial rights and autonomy.

Russia is an asymmetrical federation in that republics have their own constitutions, official languages, and national anthems, but other subjects do not. The republics also originally had more powers devolved to them, though actual power varied between republics, depending largely upon their economic importance. Through the signing of bilateral treaties with the federal government, republics gained extensive authority over their economies, internal policies, and even foreign relations in the 1990s. However, after the turn of the century, Vladimir Putin&#x27;s centralization reforms steadily eradicated the autonomy of the republics with the exception of Chechnya. The bilateral agreements were abolished and in practice all power now rests with the federal government. Since the termination of the final bilateral treaty in 2017, some commentators consider Russia to no longer be a federation.

In 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine, incorporating the territory as the Republic of Crimea. However, it remains internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia declared the annexation of four partially-occupied Ukrainian provinces (&quot;oblasts&quot;), including the territory that had been under the control of the break-away Donetsk and Luhansk republics since 2014, and claimed the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces as Russian republics. These also remain internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.

==History==
The republics were established in early Soviet Russia after the collapse of the Russian Empire. On 15 November 1917, Vladimir Lenin issued the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia, giving Russia&#x27;s minorities the right to self-determination. This declaration, however, was never truly meant to grant minorities the right to independence and was only used to garner support among minority groups for the fledgling Soviet state in the ensuing Russian Civil War. Attempts to create independent states using Lenin&#x27;s declaration were suppressed throughout the civil war by the Bolsheviks. When the Soviet Union was formally created on 30 December 1922, the minorities of the country were relegated to Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSR), which had less power than the union republics and were subordinate to them. In the aftermath of the civil war the Bolsheviks began a process of delimitation in order to draw the borders of the country. Through Joseph Stalin&#x27;s theory on nationality, borders were drawn to create national homelands for various recognized ethnic groups. Early republics like the Kazakh ASSR and the Turkestan ASSR in Central Asia were dissolved and split up to create new union republics. With delimitation came the policy of indigenization which encouraged the de-Russification of the country and promotion of minority languages and culture. This policy also affected ethnic Russians and was particularly enforced in ASSRs where indigenous people were already a minority in their own homeland, like the Buryat ASSR. Language and culture flourished and ultimately institutionalized ethnicity in the state apparatus of the country. Despite this, the Bolsheviks worked to isolate the country&#x27;s new republics by surrounding them within Russian territory for fear of them seeking independence. In 1925 the Bashkir ASSR lost its border with the future Kazakh SSR with the creation of the so-called &quot;Orenburg corridor&quot;, thereby enclaving the entire Volga region. The Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast lost access to the Barents Sea and became an enclave on 15 July 1929 prior to being upgraded to the Komi ASSR in 1936.
By the 1930s, the mood shifted as the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin stopped enforcing indigenization and began purging non-Russians from government and intelligentsia. Thus, a period of Russification set in. Russian became mandatory in all areas of non-Russian ethnicity and the Cyrillic script became compulsory for all languages of the Soviet Union. The constitution stated that the ASSRs had power to enforce their own policies within their territory, but in practice the ASSRs and their titular nationalities were some of the most affected by Stalin&#x27;s purges and were strictly controlled by Moscow. From 1937, the &quot;bourgeois nationalists&quot; became the &quot;enemy of the Russian people&quot; and indigenization was abolished. On 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, forcing it in to the Second World War, and advanced deep in to Russian territory. In response, Stalin abolished the Volga German ASSR on 7 September 1941 and exiled the Volga Germans to Central Asia and Siberia. When the Soviets gained the upper hand and began recapturing territory in 1943, many minorities of the country began to be seen as German collaborators by Stalin and were accused of treason, particularly in southern Russia. Between 1943 and 1945, ethnic Balkars, Chechens, Crimean Tatars, Ingush, 
and Kalmyks were deported &quot;en masse&quot; from the region to remote parts of the country. Immediately after the deportations the Soviet government passed decrees that liquidated the Kalmyk ASSR on 27 December 1943, the Crimean ASSR on 23 February 1944, the Checheno-Ingush ASSR on 7 March 1944, and renamed the Kabardino-Balkar ASSR the Kabardian ASSR on 8 April 1944. After Stalin&#x27;s death on 5 March 1953, the new government of Nikita Khrushchev sought to undo his controversial legacy. During his Secret speech on 25 February 1956 Khrushchev rehabilitated Russia&#x27;s minorities. The Kabardino-Balkar ASSR and the Checheno-Ingush ASSR were restored on 9 January 1957 while the Kalmyk ASSR was restored on 29 July 1958. The government, however, refused to restore the Volga German ASSR and the Crimean ASSR, the latter of which was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR on 19 February 1954.

The autonomies of the ASSRs varied greatly throughout the history of the Soviet Union but Russification would nevertheless continue unabated and internal Russian migration to the ASSRs would result in various indigenous people becoming minorities in their own republics. At the same time, the number of ASSRs grew; the Karelian ASSR was formed on 6 July 1956 after being a union republic from 1940 while the partially recognized state of Tuva was annexed by the Soviets on 11 October 1944 and became the Tuvan ASSR on 10 October 1961. By the 1980s General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s introduction of &quot;glasnost&quot; began a period of revitalization of minority culture in the ASSRs. From 1989, Gorbachev&#x27;s Soviet Union and the Russian SFSR, led by Boris Yeltsin, were locked in a power struggle. Yeltsin sought support from the ASSRs by promising more devolved powers and to build a federation &quot;from the ground up&quot;. On 12 June 1990, the Russian SFSR issued a Declaration of State Sovereignty, proclaiming Russia a sovereign state whose laws take priority over Soviet ones. The following month Yeltsin told the ASSRs to &quot;take as much sovereignty as you can swallow&quot; during a speech in Kazan, Tatar ASSR.
These events prompted the ASSRs to assert themselves against a now weakened Soviet Union. Throughout 1990 and 1991, most of the ASSRs followed Russia&#x27;s lead and issued &quot;declarations of sovereignty&quot;, elevating their statuses to that of union republics within a federal Russia. The Dagestan ASSR and Mordovian ASSR were the only republics that did not proclaim sovereignty.

In the final year of the Soviet Union, negotiations were underway for a new treaty to restructure the country in to a loose confederation. Gorbachev invited the ASSRs to be participants in the drafting of the treaty, thereby recognizing them as equal to the union republics. However, a coup attempt in August 1991 derailed the negotiations and the union republics began to declare their independence throughout the year. The Soviet Union collapsed on 26 December 1991 and the position of the ASSRs became uncertain. By law, the ASSRs did not have the right to secede from the Soviet Union like the union republics did but the question of independence from Russia nevertheless became a topic of discussion in some of the ASSRs. The declarations of sovereignty adopted by the ASSRs were divided on the topic of secession. Some advocated the integrity of the Russian Federation, others were muted on the subject, while others like the Komi ASSR, Mari ASSR, and Tuvan ASSR reserved the right to self-determination. Yeltsin was an avid supporter of national sovereignty and recognized the independence of the union republics in what was called a &quot;parade of sovereignties&quot;. In regards to the ASSRs, however, Yeltsin did not support secession and tried to prevent them from declaring independence. The Checheno-Ingush ASSR, led by Dzhokhar Dudayev, unilaterally declared independence on 1 November 1991 and Yeltsin would attempt to retake it on 11 December 1994, beginning the First Chechen War. When the Tatar ASSR held a referendum on whether to declare independence on 21 March 1992, he had the ballot declared illegal by the Constitutional Court.
On 31 March 1992, every subject of Russia except the Tatar ASSR and the &quot;de facto&quot; state of Chechnya signed the Treaty of Federation with the government of Russia, solidifying its federal structure and Boris Yeltsin became the country&#x27;s first president. The ASSRs were dissolved and became the modern day republics. The number of republics increased dramatically as the autonomous oblasts of Adygea, Gorno-Altai, Khakassia, and Karachay-Cherkessia were elevated to full republics, while the Ingush portion of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR refused to be part of the breakaway state and rejoined Russia as the Republic of Ingushetia on 4 June 1992. The Republic of Tatarstan demanded its own agreement to preserve its autonomy within the Russian Federation and on 15 February 1994, Moscow and Kazan signed a power-sharing deal, in which the latter was granted a high degree of autonomy. 45 other regions, including the other republics, would go on to sign autonomy agreements with the federal center. By the mid 1990s, the overly complex structure of the various bilateral agreements between regional governments and Moscow sparked a call for reform. The constitution of Russia was the supreme law of the country, but in practice, the power-sharing agreements superseded it while the poor oversight of regional affairs left the republics to be governed by authoritarian leaders who ruled for personal benefit. Meanwhile, the war in Chechnya entered a stalemate as Russian forces were unable to wrest control of the republic despite capturing the capital Grozny on 8 February 1995 and killing Dudayev months later in an airstrike. Faced with a demoralized army and universal public opposition to the war, Yeltsin was forced to sign the Khasavyurt Accord with Chechnya on 30 August 1996 and eventually withdrew troops. A year later Chechnya and Russia signed the Moscow Peace Treaty, ending Russia&#x27;s attempts to retake the republic. As the decade drew to a close, the fallout from the failed Chechen war and the subsequent financial crisis in 1998 resulted in Yeltsin resigning on 31 December 1999. 
Yeltsin declared Vladimir Putin as interim president and his successor. Despite preserving the republic&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; independence following the war, Chechnya&#x27;s new president Aslan Maskhadov proved incapable of fixing the republic&#x27;s devastated economy and maintaining order as the territory became increasingly lawless and a breeding ground for Islamic fundamentalism. Using this lawlessness extremists invaded neighboring Dagestan and bombed various apartment blocks in Russia, resulted in Putin sending troops into Chechnya again on 1 October 1999. Chechen resistance quickly fell apart in the face of a federal blitzkrieg and indiscriminate bombing campaign as troops captured Grozny on 6 February 2000 and pushed rebels in to the mountains. Moscow imposed direct rule on Chechnya on 9 June 2000 and the territory was officially reintegrated in to the Russian Federation as the Chechen Republic on 24 March 2003.

Putin would participate in the 26 March 2000 election on the promise of completely restructuring the federal system and restoring the authority of the central government. The power-sharing agreements began to gradually expire or be terminated and after 2003 only Tatarstan and Bashkortostan continued to negotiate on their treaties&#x27; extensions. Bashkortostan&#x27;s power-sharing treaty expired on 7 July 2005, leaving Tatarstan as the sole republic to maintain its autonomy, which was renewed on 11 July 2007. After an attack by Chechen separatists at a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, Putin abolished direct elections for governors and assumed the power to personally appoint and dismiss them. Throughout the decade, influential regional leaders like Mintimer Shaimiev of Tatarstan and Murtaza Rakhimov of Bashkortostan, who were adamant on extending their bilateral agreements with Moscow, were dismissed, removing the last vestiges of regional autonomy from the 1990s. On 24 July 2017, Tatarstan&#x27;s power-sharing agreement with Moscow expired, making it the last republic to lose its special status. After the agreement&#x27;s termination, some commentators expressed the view that Russia ceased to be a federation. In 2022, Russia&#x27;s ethnic republics suffered heavy losses in the invasion of Ukraine.

==Constitutional status==

Republics differ from other federal subjects in that they have the right to establish their own official language, have their own constitution, and have a national anthem. Other federal subjects, such as krais and oblasts, are not explicitly given this right. During Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s presidency, the republics were the first subjects to be granted extensive power from the federal government, and were often given preferential treatment over other subjects, which has led to Russia being characterized as an &quot;asymmetrical federation&quot;. The Treaty of Federation signed on 31 March 1992 stipulated that the republics were &quot;sovereign states&quot; that had expanded rights over natural resources, external trade, and internal budgets. The signing of bilateral treaties with the republics would grant them additional powers, however, the amount of autonomy given differed by republic and was mainly based on their economic wealth rather than ethnic composition. Sakha, for example, was granted more control over its resources, being able to keep most of its revenue and sell and receive its profits independently due to its vast diamond deposits. North Ossetia on the other hand, a poorer republic, was mainly granted more control over defense and internal security due to its location in the restive North Caucasus. Tatarstan and Bashkortostan had the authority to establish their own foreign relations and conduct agreements with foreign governments. This has led to criticism from oblasts and krais. After the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the current constitution was adopted but the republics were no longer classified as &quot;sovereign states&quot; and all subjects of the federation were declared equal, though maintaining the validity of the bilateral agreements.

In theory, the constitution of Russia was the ultimate authority over the republics, but the power-sharing treaties held greater weight in practice. Republics often created their own laws which contradicted the constitution. Yeltsin, however, made little effort to rein in renegade laws, preferring to turn a blind eye to violations in exchange for political loyalty. Vladimir Putin&#x27;s election on 26 March 2000 began a period of extensive reforms to centralize authority with the federal government and bring all laws in line with the constitution. His first act as president was the creation of federal districts on 18 May 2000, which were tasked with exerting federal control over the country&#x27;s subjects. Putin later established the so-called &quot;Kozak Commission&quot; in June 2001 to examine the division of powers between the government and regions. The Commission&#x27;s recommendations focused mainly on minimizing the basis of regional autonomy and transferring lucrative powers meant for the republics to the federal government. Centralization of power would continue as the republics gradually lost more and more autonomy to the federal government, leading the European Parliament to conclude that Russia functions as a unitary state despite officially being a federation. On 29 December 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev signed a law banning the leaders of the republics from holding the title of &#x27;president&#x27;. Tatarstan, however, resisted attempts to abolish its presidential post and remained the only republic to maintain the title. Putin subsequently signed a law forcing Tatarstan to abolish its title by June 2022. On 19 June 2018, a bill was passed that elevated the status of the Russian language at the expense of other official languages in the republics. The bill authorized the abolition of mandatory minority language classes in schools and for voluntary teaching to be reduced to two hours a week.
Chechnya is the sole exception to Putin&#x27;s centralization efforts. With the republic&#x27;s reentry into Russia after the Second Chechen War, Chechnya was given broad autonomy in exchange for remaining within the country. At the end of the war, Putin bought the loyalty of local elites and granted Chechnya the right to manage its own affairs in dealing with separatists and governing itself outside of Russian control in a process called &quot;Chechenization&quot;. With the appointment of Ramzan Kadyrov by Putin to lead the republic in 2007, the independence of Chechnya has grown significantly. The Russian government gives Chechnya generous subsidies in exchange for loyalty and maintaining security in the region. Observers have noted Putin&#x27;s reluctance or inability to exert control over Kadyrov&#x27;s rule for fear it could trigger another conflict. Chechnya under Kadyrov operates outside of Russian law, has its own independent security force, and conducts its own &quot;de facto&quot; foreign policy. This has led to Chechnya being characterized as a &quot;state within a state&quot;.

There are secessionist movements in most republics, but these are generally not very strong. The constitution makes no mention on whether a republic can legally secede from the Russian Federation. However, the Constitutional Court of Russia ruled after the unilateral secession of Chechnya in 1991 that the republics do not have the right to secede and are inalienable parts of the country. Despite this, some republican constitutions in the 1990s had articles giving them the right to become independent. This included Tuva, whose constitution had an article explicitly giving it the right to secede. However, following Putin&#x27;s centralization reforms in the early 2000s, these articles were subsequently dropped. The Kabardino-Balkar Republic, for example, adopted a new constitution in 2001 which prevents the republic from existing independently of the Russian Federation. After Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, the State Duma adopted a law making it illegal to advocate for the secession of any region on 5 July 2014.

==Status of southeast Ukraine==
On 18 March 2014, Russia annexed the Autonomous Republic of Crimea of Ukraine after a referendum. The peninsula subsequently became the Republic of Crimea, the 22nd republic of Russia. However, Ukraine and most of the international community do not recognize Crimea&#x27;s annexation and the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 declared the referendum to be invalid.

On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and conquered large swaths of southern and eastern Ukraine. As early as March leaders in both the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic expressed their wish to join Russia, originally once Russia captured all their claimed territory. However, after sudden Ukrainian gains in the east in September 2022, the republics organised a series of referendums on joining Russia, in which an overwhelming majority reportedly supported annexation. On 30 September 2022, Putin formally announced the annexation of the two republics and also of two Ukrainian oblasts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The referendums were condemned internationally – the European Union and G7 rejected them as illegal while the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the annexations as a violation of the UN Charter.

==Proposed republics==
=== Entities in Russia ===
In response to the apparent federal inequality, in which the republics were given special privileges during the early years of Yeltsin&#x27;s tenure at the expense of other subjects, Eduard Rossel, then governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast and advocate of equal rights for all subjects, attempted to transform his oblast into the Ural Republic on 1 July 1993 in order to receive the same benefits. Initially supportive, Yeltsin later dissolved the republic and fired Rossel on 9 November 1993. The only other attempt to formally create a republic occurred in Vologda Oblast when authorities declared their wish to create a &quot;Vologda Republic&quot; on 14 May 1993. This declaration, however, was ignored by Moscow and eventually faded from public consciousness. Other attempts to unilaterally create a republic never materialized. These included a &quot;Pomor Republic&quot; in Arkhangelsk Oblast, a &quot;Southern Urals Republic&quot; in Chelyabinsk Oblast, a &quot;Chukotka Republic&quot; in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, a &quot;Yenisei Republic&quot; in Irkutsk Oblast, a &quot;Leningrad Republic&quot; in Leningrad Oblast, a &quot;Nenets Republic&quot; in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, a &quot;Siberian Republic&quot; in Novosibirsk Oblast, a &quot;Primorsky Republic&quot; in Primorsky Krai, a &quot;Neva Republic&quot; in the city of Saint Petersburg, and a republic consisting of eleven regions in western Russia centered around Oryol Oblast.

Other attempts to create republics came in the form of splitting up already existing territories. After the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse, a proposal was put forth to split the Karachay-Cherkess Republic into multiple smaller republics. The idea was rejected by referendum on 28 March 1992. A similar proposal occurred in the Republic of Mordovia to divide it to separate Erzyan and Mokshan homelands. The proposal was rejected in 1995.

===Entities outside Russia===
====Abkhazia====
After the brief 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Russia secured the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of Abkhazia from Georgia and promptly recognized it. Georgian officials have expressed worry that Russia will seek to absorb the region. On 25 November 2014, Abkhazia signed a treaty integrating its economy and military with Russia, which Georgia described as a step to &quot;toward &quot;de facto&quot; annexation&quot;. However, the proposal to join Russia has little to no support among Abkhazia&#x27;s political elite or the general public, with many of the former expressing their view that Abkhazia is different situationally from nearby South Ossetia. Despite this, Abkhazia relies entirely on Russia for financial support and much of its state structure is highly integrated with Russia; it uses the Russian ruble, its foreign policy is coordinated with Russia, and a majority of its citizens have Russian passports. On 12 November 2020, Abkhazia and Russia signed a new integration agreement expanding on their previous one from 2014, which Georgia condemned as another step toward annexation. The new agreement envisioned further harmonization of Abkhazia with Russian law and was criticized within the region for risking the loss of Abkhazia&#x27;s sovereignty, which the government denied.

====South Ossetia====

After the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse South Ossetia sought to break away from Georgia and become independent. On 19 January 1992 a referendum was held. Ostensibly, 99.9% of voters approved independence, but the results were not recognized internationally. A second question asking for unification with Russia also ostensibly passed at about 99.9%. Similar to Abkhazia, South Ossetia had its independence secured and recognized by Russia in 2008. However, unlike Abkhazia, officials in both Russia and South Ossetia have repeatedly expressed their wish to see South Ossetia join Russia. An opinion poll conducted in 2010 showed that over 80% of people supported integration with Russia. On 18 March 2015 South Ossetia signed a treaty integrating the region&#x27;s economy and military with Russia, identical to the one signed by Abkhazia. The treaty was condemned by Georgia as an &quot;actual annexation&quot; of the region. Later that year South Ossetian president Leonid Tibilov said he was preparing a referendum to join Russia. However, such a referendum never took place due to Russia&#x27;s refusal to endorse the proposal. Instead a referendum was held on 9 April 2017 to change South Ossetia&#x27;s official name to &quot;Republic of South Ossetia–The State of Alania&quot; to mirror its northern counterpart North Ossetia, officially the &quot;Republic of North Ossetia–Alania&quot;, implying future unification.

On 30 March 2022 the government of South Ossetia announced it would revive attempts to hold a referendum on joining Russia. Officials expressed hope of finishing the legal process to hold the referendum by April 10, however, it is unknown whether Russia will again reject the proposal or not. On 13 May 2022 outgoing president Anatoly Bibilov signed a decree authorizing a referendum on annexation by July 17. However, Alan Gagloyev, who defeated Bibilov in an election, expressed skepticism, saying that while he does not oppose the referendum, he believes there should first be a &quot;signal&quot; from Russia. Gagloyev promptly scrapped the referendum pending talks with Russia on integration.

====Transnistria====
Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova, had long sought to rejoin Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. After proclaiming independence and fighting a war against Moldova with the help of Russia in 1992, the region has remained under Russian occupation. Transnistria made multiple appeals to integrate with Russia, which the latter has consistently ignored. In a 2006 referendum an overwhelming majority of people voted in favor of its accession to Russia, though these results could not be independently confirmed. After Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Transnistria appealed to Russia to join it. There is still some hope inside Transnistria for Russia to annex the region. Despite ignoring Transnistria&#x27;s appeals for accession, the region enjoys Russian support and is highly dependent on it. Over 200,000 Transnistrian citizens own a Russian passport and many prefer to leave the region and work in Russia. Russia provides gas at bargain prices, pays the pensions of its residents, and allocates funds to build infrastructure. A Russian military garrison operates in Transnistria ostensibly as a peacekeeping force. Moldova for its part rejects any attempt by Transnistria to secede and join Russia and insists on the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the region. With Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 a Russian general said they planned to create a land bridge connecting to Transnistria. The region has also suffered significant trade losses due to the invasion of Ukraine and has become more reliant on trade with the European Union.

<text>Xu Xiake (, January 5, 1587 – March 8, 1641), born Xu Hongzu (), courtesy name Zhenzhi (), was a Chinese explorer, geographer, and travel writer of the Ming dynasty, known best for his famous geographical treatise, and noted for his bravery and humility. He traveled throughout China for more than 30 years, documenting his travels extensively. The records of his travels were compiled posthumously in &quot;The Travel Diaries of Xu Xiake&quot;, and his work translated by Ding Wenjiang. Xu&#x27;s writing falls under the old Chinese literary category of &#x27;travel record literature&#x27; (&#x27;youji wenxue&#x27;“遊記文學”), which used narrative and prose styles of writing to portray one&#x27;s travel experiences.

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy barracks ship &quot;Xu Xiake&quot; was named after him.

== Life ==

With ancestors from Jiangxi province, Xu Xiake was born in what is today Jiangyin (in Jiangsu province) as Xu Hongzu (), as the second son of Xu Yu&#x27;an (徐豫庵, 1545–1594) and Wang Ruren (王孺人, 1545–1625). It was often said his mother encouraged him to travel and this shaped Xu&#x27;s predilections. His sobriquet is Zhenzhi (). &quot;Xiake&quot; was an alternate sobriquet () given to him by his friend Chen Jiru (陳繼儒, 1558–1639) and it means &quot;one who is in the sunset clouds&quot;. His other friend, Huang Daozhou (黃道周, 1585–1646), also gave Xu an alternate sobriquet: &quot;Xiayi&quot; (), meaning &quot;untrammelled in the sunset clouds.&quot;

On his journeys throughout China, he travelled with a servant called Gu Xing (). He faced many hardships along the way, as he was often dependent on the patronage of local scholars who would help him after he had been robbed of all his belongings. Local Buddhist abbots of the various places he visited often would pay him money as well, for the small service of recording the history of their local monastery. From the snowy passes of Sichuan, to the subtropical jungles of Guangxi and Yunnan, to the mountains of Tibet, Xu Xiake wrote of all his experiences and provided enormous amounts of written detail from his observations.

==Travel records==

The written work of Xu Xiake&#x27;s travel records and diaries contained some 404,000 Chinese characters, an enormous work for a single author of his time. Xu traveled throughout the provinces of Ming China, often on foot, to write his enormous geographical and topographical treatise, documenting various details of his travels, such as the locations of small gorges, or mineral beds such as mica schists. Xu&#x27;s work was quite systematic, providing accurate details of measurement, and his work, later translated into modern Chinese by Ding Wenjiang, reads more like the accounts of a 20th-century field surveyor than an early 17th-century scholar. In Guizhou, he made the discovery of the true source of the West River. He also discovered the Mekong and Salween rivers were, in fact, separate drainages with completely separate watersheds. Xu made the important realization that the Jinsha river network and not the Min or Yalong formed the true headwaters of the Yangtze River, correcting a mistake in Chinese geography as old as the &quot;Tribute of Yu&quot; compiled by Confucius in the Classic of History.

<text>The living creatures, living beings, or chayyoth () are a class of heavenly beings in Jewish mythology. They are described in the prophet Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of the heavenly chariot in the first and tenth chapters of the Book of Ezekiel. References to the sacred creatures recur in texts of Second Temple Judaism, in rabbinical &quot;merkabah&quot; (&quot;chariot&quot;) literature, in the Book of Revelation in the Christian New Testament, and in the Zohar.

According to Jewish and Christian traditions, there are four living creatures, although their description varies by source. The symbolic depiction of the four living creatures in religious art, especially Christian art, is called a tetramorph.

==Ezekiel&#x27;s four living creatures==
Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of the four living creatures in Ezekiel 1 are identified as cherubim in Ezekiel 10, who are God&#x27;s throne bearers. Cherubim as minor guardian deities of temple or palace thresholds are known throughout the Ancient East. Each of Ezekiel&#x27;s cherubim have four faces, that of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. However, the fact that they manifest in human form sets them apart from the griffin-like cherubs and lamassu of Babylonia and Assyria. Concerning their ability to move, Ezekiel&#x27;s cherubim do not need to turn, since they face all compass points simultaneously. This description of movement differs from that of the seraphim in Isaiah&#x27;s vision () who have an extra set of wings, giving them the ability to fly.

==Revelation&#x27;s four living beings==
In the New Testament book of , four living beings (Greek: ζῷον, &quot;zōion&quot;) are seen in John&#x27;s vision. These appear as a lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle, much as in Ezekiel but in a different order. They have six wings, whereas Ezekiel&#x27;s four living creatures are described as having four. In verse 6, they are said to have &quot;eyes all over, front and back&quot;, suggesting that they are alert and knowledgeable, that nothing escapes their notice. The description parallels &quot;the wheels&quot; that are beside the living creatures in Ezekiel 1:18; 10:12, which are said to be &quot;full of eyes all around&quot;. The Hebrew word for &quot;wheel&quot; (ôpannîm) was also used in later Jewish literature to indicate a member of the angelic orders (1 Enoch 71:7; 3 Enoch 1:8; 7:1; 25:5–6, etc.). 

Comparing the living creatures in Ezekiel with Revelation&#x27;s is a prominent apocalyptic study in Western Christianity. An example is the 18th century works of Jonathan Edwards&#x27; recorded interpretation of 1722/23. The four living creatures that John of Patmos sees in the Book of Revelation, is the author&#x27;s reworking of the living creatures in the visions of Ezekiel () and Isaiah ().

William D. Mounce noted a belief that the living creatures may have been associated with the four principal (or fixed) signs of the zodiac (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius), but other scholars have doubted this interpretation.

In a critical analysis of John&#x27;s vision, April De Conick&#x27;s 2006 essay outlines that the &quot;hayyot&quot; in Ezekiel are perhaps not original with the author of Revelation. De Conick suggests that John may have drawn from other merkabah-related texts and by subtly working with images already known to his audience, he reshaped them for his own purposes. With John blending and transforming the images of his sources, it has given way to different interpretations.

==Religious views== 

In Judaism, the living beings are considered angels of fire, who hold up the throne of God. According to the Zohar, they hold up the firmament itself. They are ranked first in Maimonides&#x27; Jewish angelic hierarchy. They have also been correlated with four archangels: &quot;Michael is the &#x27;lion-headed&#x27;, Raphael the &quot;human-headed&quot;, Uriel the &quot;bull-headed&quot;, and Gabriel the &quot;eagle-headed&quot;.

In Christianity, the four living creatures are Cherubim. A prominent early interpretation, variously modified by different interpreters, has been to equate the four creatures with the Four Evangelists. Throughout church history, the most common interpretation (first laid out by Victorinus), but not the original or the only, is that the lion represents Mark, the calf Luke, the man Matthew, and the eagle John. Irenaeus was the first to make the association with the evangelists, but the interpretation laid out by Victorinus and adopted by Jerome, Gregory the Great, and the Book of Kells became dominant. Its influence has been on art and sculpture and is still prevalent in Catholicism and Anglicanism. A view held by many modern commentators is that the four living creatures of Revelation are agents of God and heavenly representatives of the created order, who call every living thing to worship the Creator.

A traditional view is that the four faces (Revelation 4:6-8) refer to the many aspects (or attributes) of Jesus Christ as depicted in the four Gospels.

The Man

The man represents Jesus as the Son of Man, symbolizing His humanity, vulnerability, and compassion. This face is often associated with Jesus’ role as the Son of Man, who came to seek and save the lost. The man is also a symbol of wisdom, understanding, and empathy.

The Ox

The ox represents Jesus as the Obedient Servant, symbolizing His humility, submission, and willingness to serve. This face is often associated with Jesus’ role as the Servant of the Lord, who came to serve and give His life as a ransom for many. The ox is also a symbol of strength, endurance, and sacrifice.

The Lion

The lion represents Jesus as the Lion of Judah, symbolizing His power, strength, and royalty. This face is often associated with Jesus’ role as the Messiah, the King of Kings, and the one who will judge the world. The lion is also a symbol of courage, bravery, and protection.

The Eagle

The eagle represents Jesus as the Son of God, symbolizing His divinity, majesty, and power. This face is often associated with Jesus’ role as the Son of God, who came to reveal the Father’s love and glory. The eagle is also a symbol of freedom, strength, and vision.

These four faces of Jesus are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary, reflecting the multifaceted nature of Jesus’ character and ministry. Each face represents a different aspect of His personality, role, and mission, and together they form a complete picture of who Jesus is and what He has done for us.

Another view found in a popular Greek Orthodox Catechism, is that the living creatures represent four covenants given to mankind. The lion represents the Noahic covenant in the sign of the rainbow, the ox represents the Abrahamic covenant of circumcision, the man represents Moses giving the law, and the eagle represents the new covenant Gospel of Christ.

== Secular views ==
It has been proposed that the phenomena described in Ezekiel were halos caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere, such as sun dogs.

<doc id="645381" wikidata="Q1573644" url="?curid=645381" title="Merkabah mysticism">
<text>Merkabah () or Merkavah mysticism (lit. Chariot mysticism) is a school of early Jewish mysticism, c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE, centered on visions such as those found in Ezekiel 1 or in the hekhalot literature (&quot;palaces&quot; literature), concerning stories of ascents to the heavenly palaces and the Throne of God.

The main corpus of the Merkabah literature was composed in the period 200–700 CE, although later references to the Chariot tradition can also be found in the literature of the Ashkenazi Hasidim in the Middle Ages. A major text in this tradition is the &quot;Maaseh Merkabah&quot; ().

==Etymology==
The noun &quot;merkavah&quot; &quot;thing to ride in, cart&quot; is derived from the consonantal root &quot;&quot; with the general meaning &quot;to ride&quot;. The word &quot;chariot&quot; is found 44 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible—most of them referring to normal chariots on earth, and although the concept of the Merkabah is associated with Ezekiel&#x27;s vision (1:4–26), the word is not explicitly written in Ezekiel 1.

However, when left untranslated, in English the Hebrew term &quot;merkavah&quot; relates to the throne-chariot of God in prophetic visions. It is most closely associated with the vision in Ezekiel 1 of the four-wheeled vehicle driven by four &quot;hayyot&quot; &quot;living creatures&quot;, each of which has four wings and the four faces of a man, lion, ox, and eagle (or vulture).

==Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of the chariot==

According to the verses in Ezekiel and its attendant commentaries, his vision consists of a chariot made of many heavenly beings driven by the &quot;Likeness of a Man&quot;. The base structure of the chariot is composed of four beings. These beings are called the &quot;living creatures&quot; ( &quot;hayyot&quot; or &quot;khayyot&quot;). The bodies of the creatures are &quot;like that of a human being&quot;, but each of them has four faces, corresponding to the four directions the chariot can go (East, South, North and West). The faces are that of a man, a lion, an ox (later changed to a cherub in Ezekiel ) and an eagle. Since there are four angels and each has four faces, there are a total of sixteen faces. Each of the &quot;hayyot&quot; angels also has four wings. Two of these wings spread across the length of the chariot and connect with the wings of the angel on the other side. This creates a sort of &#x27;box&#x27; of wings that forms the perimeter of the chariot. With the remaining two wings, each angel covers its own body. Below, but not attached to, the feet of the &quot;hayyot&quot; angels are other angels that are shaped like wheels. These wheel angels, which are described as &quot;a wheel inside of a wheel&quot;, are called &quot;ophanim&quot; אופנים (lit. wheels, cycles or ways). These wheels are not directly under the chariot but are nearby and along its perimeter. The angel with the face of the man is always on the east side and looks up at the &quot;Likeness of a Man&quot; that drives the chariot. The &quot;Likeness of a Man&quot; sits on a throne made of &quot;sapphire&quot;.

The Bible later makes mention of a third type of angel found in the merkabah called &quot;seraphim&quot; (lit. &quot;burning&quot;) angels. These angels appear like flashes of fire continuously ascending and descending. These &quot;seraphim&quot; angels power the movement of the chariot. In the hierarchy of these angels, &quot;hayyoth&quot; are the highest, that is, closest to God, followed by the &quot;ophanim&quot;, which are followed by the &quot;seraphim&quot;. The chariot is in a constant state of motion, and the energy behind this movement runs according to this hierarchy. The movement of the &quot;ophanim&quot; is controlled by the &quot;Living creatures&quot;, or &quot;Hayyot&quot;, while the movement of the &quot;hayyot&quot; is controlled by the &quot;seraphim&quot;. The movement of all the angels of the chariot is controlled by the &quot;Likeness of a Man&quot; on the Throne.

==Early Jewish merkabah mysticism==

Mark Verman has distinguished four periods in early Jewish mysticism, developing from Isaiah&#x27;s and Ezekiel&#x27;s visions of the Throne/Chariot, to later extant merkabah mysticism texts:
# 800–500 BCE, mystical elements in Prophetic Judaism such as Ezekiel&#x27;s chariot
# Beginning c. 530s BCE, especially 300–100 BCE, Apocalyptic literature mysticism
# Beginning c. 100 BCE, especially 1–130s CE, early Rabbinic merkabah mysticism referred to briefly in exoteric Rabbinic literature such as the &quot;Pardes&quot; ascent; also related to early Christian mysticism
# c. 1–200 CE, continuing till c. 1000 CE, merkabah mystical ascent accounts in the esoteric merkabah-Hekhalot literature

===Rabbinic commentary===
The earliest Rabbinic Merkabah commentaries were exegetical expositions of the prophetic visions of God in the heavens and the divine retinue of angels, hosts, and heavenly creatures surrounding God. The earliest evidence suggests that Merkabah homiletics did not give rise to ascent experiences—as one rabbinic sage states: &quot;Many have expounded upon the merkabah without ever seeing it.&quot;

One mention of the Merkabah in the Talmud notes the importance of the passage: &quot;A great issue—the account of the Merkavah; a small issue—the discussions of Abaye and Rava [famous Talmudic sages].&quot; The sages Yohanan ben Zakkai (d. c. 80 CE) and Rabbi Akiva (d. 135) were deeply involved in merkabah exegesis. Rabbi Akiva and his contemporary Ishmael ben Elisha are often the protagonists of later Merkabah ascent literature.

===Prohibition against study===

The Talmudic interdictions concerning merkabah speculation are numerous and widely held. Discussions concerning the merkabah were limited to only the most worthy sages, and admonitory legends are preserved about the dangers of overzealous speculation concerning the merkabah.

For example, the secret doctrines might not be discussed in public: &quot;Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.&quot; It must be studied only by exemplary scholars: &quot;&quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Bereshit&quot; must not be explained before two, nor &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Merkabah&quot; before one, unless he be wise and understands it by himself.&quot; Further commentary notes that the chapter-headings of &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Merkabah&quot; may be taught, as was done by Rabbi Ḥiyya. According to &quot;Yer. Hagigah&quot; ii. 1, the teacher read the headings of the chapters, after which, subject to the approval of the teacher, the pupil read to the end of the chapter, although Rabbi Zera said that even the chapter-headings might be communicated only to a person who was head of a school and was cautious in temperament.

According to Rabbi Ammi, the secret doctrine might be entrusted only to one who possessed the five qualities enumerated in (being experienced in any of five different professions requiring good judgement), and a certain age is, of course, necessary. When R. Johanan wished to initiate R. Eliezer in the &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Merkabah&quot;, the latter answered, &quot;I am not yet old enough.&quot; A boy who recognized the meaning of () was consumed by fire (&quot;Hagigah&quot; 13b), and the perils connected with the unauthorized discussion of these subjects are often described (&quot;Hagigah&quot; ii. 1; &quot;Shab.&quot; 80b).

===Jewish development===

Beyond the rabbinic community, Jewish apocalyptists also engaged in visionary exegeses concerning the divine realm and the divine creatures which are remarkably similar to the rabbinic material. A small number of texts unearthed at Qumran indicate that the Dead Sea community also engaged in merkabah exegesis. Recently uncovered Jewish mystical texts also evidence a deep affinity with the rabbinic merkabah homilies.

The merkabah homilies eventually consisted of detailed descriptions of multiple layered heavens (usually Seven Heavens), often guarded over by angels, and encircled by flames and lightning. The highest heaven contains seven palaces (&quot;hekhalot&quot;), and in the innermost palace resides a supreme divine image (God&#x27;s Glory or an angelic image) seated on a throne, surrounded by awesome hosts who sing God&#x27;s praise.

When these images were combined with an actual mystical experiential motif of individual ascent (paradoxically called &quot;descent&quot; in most texts, &quot;Yordei Merkabah&quot;, &quot;descenders of the chariot&quot;, perhaps describing inward contemplation) and union is not precisely known. By inference, contemporary historians of Jewish mysticism usually date this development to the third century CE. 

===&quot;Maaseh Merkabah&quot;===

&quot;Maaseh Merkabah&quot; (&quot;Work of the Chariot&quot;) is the modern name given to a &quot;Hekhalot&quot; text, discovered by scholar Gershom Scholem. &quot;Maaseh Merkabah&quot; dates from late Hellenistic period, after the end of the Second Temple period following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when the physical cult ceased to function. The idea of making a journey to the heavenly &quot;hekhal&quot; seems to be a kind of spiritualization of the pilgrimages to the earthly &quot;hekhal&quot; that were now no longer possible. It is a form of pre-Kabbalah Jewish mysticism that teaches both of the possibility of making a sublime journey to God and of the ability of man to draw down divine powers to earth; it seems to have been an esoteric movement that grew out of the priestly mysticism already evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls and some apocalyptic writings (see the studies by Rachel Elior).

Several movements in Jewish mysticism and, later, students of the Kabbalah have focused on these passages from Ezekiel, seeking underlying meaning and the secrets of Creation in what they argued was the metaphoric language of the verses.

Due to the concern of some Torah scholars that misunderstanding these passages as literal descriptions of God&#x27;s image might lead to blasphemy or idolatry, there was great opposition to studying this topic without the proper initiation. Jewish biblical commentaries emphasize that the imagery of the merkabah is not meant to be taken literally; rather the chariot and its accompanying angels are analogies for the various ways that God reveals himself in this world. Hasidic philosophy and kabbalah discuss at length what each aspect of this vision represents in this world, and how the vision does not imply that God is made up of these forms.

Jews customarily read the Biblical passages concerning the merkabah in the synagogue every year on the holiday of Shavuot, and the merkabah is also referenced in several places in traditional Jewish liturgy.

===Hekhalot literature===

The main interests of Hekhalot literature are accounts of divine visions, mystical ascents into heaven and observance of the divine council, and the summoning and control of great angels, usually for the purpose of gaining insight into Torah. The &quot;locus classicus&quot; for these practices is the biblical accounts of the Chariot vision of Ezekiel and the Temple vision of Isaiah (Chap. ). It is from these, and from the many extra-canonical apocalyptic writings of heavenly visitations, that hekhalot literature emerges. Still, it is distinctive from both Qumran literature and apocalyptic writings for several reasons, chief among them being that hekhalot literature is not at all interested in eschatology, largely ignores the unique status of the priesthood, has little interest in fallen angels or demonology, and it &quot;democratizes&quot; the possibility of divine ascent.

In their visions, these mystics would enter into the celestial realms and journey through the seven stages of mystical ascent: the Seven Heavens and seven throne rooms. Such a journey is fraught with great danger, and the adept must not only have made elaborate purification preparation, but must also know the proper incantations, seals and angelic names needed to get past the fierce angelic guards, as well as know how to navigate the various forces at work inside and outside the palaces.

This heavenly ascent is accomplished by the recital of hymns, as well as the theurgic use of secret names of God which abound in the Hekhalot literature. The &quot;Hekalot Zutarti&quot; in particular is concerned with the secret names of God and their powers:

At times, heavenly interlocutors will reveal divine secrets. In some texts, the mystic&#x27;s interest extends to the heavenly music and liturgy, usually connected with the angelic adorations mentioned in Isaiah 6:3. The mantra-like repetitive nature of the liturgies recorded in many of these compositions seems meant to encourage further ascent. The ultimate goal of the ascent varies from text to text. In some cases, it seems to be a visionary glimpse of God, to &quot;Behold the King in His Beauty&quot;. Others hint at &quot;enthronement&quot;, that the adept be accepted among the angelic retinue of God and be given an honored seat. One text actually envisions the successful pilgrim getting to sit in God&#x27;s &quot;lap&quot;. Scholars such as Peter Schaefer and Elliot Wolfson see an erotic theology implied in this kind of image, though it must be said sexual motifs, while present in highly attenuated forms, are few and far between if one surveys the full scope of the literature.

Literary works related to the Hekhalot tradition that have survived in whole or in part include &quot;Hekhalot Rabbati&quot; (or &quot;Pirkei Hekhalot&quot;), &quot;Hekhalot Zutarti&quot;, 3 Enoch (also known as &quot;Hebrew Enoch&quot;), and &quot;Maaseh Merkabah&quot;. In addition there are many smaller and fragmentary manuscripts that seem to belong to this genre, but their exact relationship to &quot;Maaseh Merkabah&quot; mysticism and to each other is often not clear (Dennis, 2007, 199–120).

===Key texts===
The ascent texts are extant in four principal works, all redacted well after the third but certainly before the ninth century CE. They are:

# &quot;Hekhalot Zutartey&quot; (&quot;The Lesser Palaces&quot;), which details an ascent of Rabbi Akiva;
# &quot;Hekhalot Rabbati&quot; (&quot;The Greater Palaces&quot;), which details an ascent of Rabbi Ishmael;
# &quot;Maaseh Merkabah&quot; (&quot;Work of the Chariot&quot;), a collection of hymns recited by the &quot;descenders&quot; and heard during their ascent;
# &quot;Sepher Hekhalot&quot; (&quot;Book of Palaces&quot;, also known as &quot;3 Enoch&quot;), which recounts an ascent and divine transformation of the biblical figure Enoch into the archangel Metatron, as related by Rabbi Ishmael.

A fifth work provides a detailed description of the Creator as seen by the &quot;descenders&quot; at the climax of their ascent. This work, preserved in various forms, is called &quot;Shi&#x27;ur Qomah&quot; (&quot;Measurement of the Body&quot;), and is rooted in a mystical exegesis of the Song of Songs, a book reputedly venerated by Rabbi Akiva. The literal message of the work was repulsive to those who maintained God&#x27;s incorporeality; Maimonides (d. 1204) wrote that the book should be erased and all mention of its existence deleted.

While throughout the era of merkabah mysticism the problem of creation was not of paramount importance, the treatise &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; (&quot;Book of Formation&quot;) represents an attempted cosmogony from within a merkabah milieu. This text was probably composed during the seventh century, and evidence suggests Neoplatonic, Pythagoric, and Stoic influences. It features a linguistic theory of creation in which God creates the universe by combining the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, along with emanations represented by the ten numerals, or &quot;sefirot&quot;.

Certain key concepts found in the Sefer Yetzirah, such as the &quot;6 directions&quot;, are mentioned in the Talmud, and also the title of the book is referenced: yet scholars do not conclude that the versions of the Sefer Yetzirah that have been handed down today are identical to the book which the Talmud references.

===Hekhalot literature and &quot;Four Entered &quot;Pardes&quot;&quot;===
Moshe Idel, Gershom Scholem, Joseph Dan, and others have raised the natural question concerning the relationship between the &quot;chambers&quot; portion of the Hekhalot literature and the Babylonian Talmud&#x27;s treatment of &quot;The Work of the Chariot&quot; in the presentation and analysis of such in the Gemara to tractate &quot;Hagigah&quot; of the Mishna. This portion of the Babylonian Talmud, which includes the famous &quot;four entered &quot;pardes&quot;&quot; material, runs from 12b-iv (wherein the Gemara&#x27;s treatment of the &quot;Work of Creation&quot; flows into and becomes its treatment of &quot;The Work of the Chariot&quot;) to and into 16a-i. (All references are to the ArtScroll pagination.)

By making use of the Rabbinically paradigmatic figures of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael in their writings, the generators of the Hekhalot literature, quite arguably, seem to be attempting to show some sort of connection between their writings and the Chariot/Throne study and practice of the Rabbinic Movement in the decades immediately following upon the destruction of the Temple. However, in both the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud the major players in this Chariot/Throne endeavor are, clearly, Rabbi Akiva and Elisha ben Abuyah who is referred to as &quot;Akher&quot;. Neither Talmud presents Rabbi Ishmael as a player in merkabah study and practice.

In the long study on these matters contained in &quot;The Written&#x27; as the Vocation of Conceiving Jewishly&quot;&quot; (McGinley, J W; 2006) the hypothesis is offered and defended that &quot;Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha&quot; (more often, simply &quot;Rabbi Ishmael&quot;) is in fact a Rabbinically sanctioned cognomen for Elisha ben Abuyah who apostatized from the Rabbinic Movement. The argument is that through this indirection Rabbinic officialdom was able to integrate into the Gemaric give and take of argumentation and analysis the huge body of halakhic and hermeneutical teachings of this great Torah scholar without, however, honoring his equally significant apostasy. To be sure, in the accounting of this figure&#x27;s mystical study and practice the pejorative (in context) &quot;Akher&quot; is used instead of &quot;Rabbi Ishmael&quot;. This is because Elisha ben Abuyah&#x27;s teachings under the heading of &quot;The Work of the Chariot&quot; came to be considered heretical in contrast to his halakhic and hermeneutical teachings which were generally admired—and whose weighty influence, in any case, could not be ignored. All of this indicates that the generators of the Hekhalot literature were indeed savvy in choosing &quot;Rabbi Ishmael&quot; as paradigmatic in their own writings as a means of relating their own endeavors to the mystical study and practices of the &quot;tannaim&quot; in the early decades following upon the destruction of the Temple.

Both Akiva and the &quot;Ishmaelic Akher&quot; traded upon the &quot;two-thrones&quot;/&quot;two-powers&quot;-in-Heaven motif in their respective merkabah-oriented undertakings. Akiva&#x27;s version is memorialized in the Babylonian Gemara to tractate &quot;Hagigah&quot; at 14a-ii wherein Akiva puts forth the pairing of God and &quot;David&quot; in a messianic version of that mystical motif. Immediately after this Akivian &quot;solution&quot; to the puzzle of thrones referred to in Song of Songs and the two thrones spoken of in Daniel, Chapter , the text presents Akiva as being pressured—and then acquiescing to—a domesticated version of this twoness theme for the single Jewish God which would be acceptable to Rabbinic officialdom. The text offers Justice [&quot;din&quot;] and Charity (&quot;ts&#x27;daqqa&quot;) as the &quot;middot&quot; of God which are enthroned in Heaven. (Again, 14a-ii) Akher&#x27;s non-Messianic and Metatron-oriented version of this &quot;two-thrones&quot;/&quot;two-powers&quot;-in-Heaven motif is discussed at length in the entry &quot;Paradigmatia&quot; of the above-mentioned study. The generic point in all of this is that by the time of the final editing of the Mishna this whole motif (along with other dimensions of merkabah-oriented study and practice) came to be severely discouraged by Rabbinic officialdom. Those who still pursued these kinds of things were marginalized by the Rabbinic Movement over the next several centuries becoming, in effect, a separate grouping responsible for the Hekhalot literature.

In the &quot;four-entered-&quot;pardes&quot;&quot; section of this portion of the Babylonian Gemara on tractate &quot;Hagigah&quot;, it is the figure of Akiva who seems to be lionized. For of the four he is the only one presented who ascended and descended &quot;whole&quot;. The other three were broken, one way or another: Ben Azzai dies soon after; Ben Zoma is presented as going insane; and worst of all, &quot;Akher&quot; apostatizes. This putative lionization of Rabbi Akiva occurs at 15b-vi-16a-i of our Gemara section.

==The merkabah in later Jewish interpretations==

===Maimonides&#x27; explanation===
Maimonides&#x27; philosophical 12th-century work &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; is in part intended as an explanation of the passages &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Bereshit&quot; and &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Merkabah&quot;. In the third volume, Maimonides commences the exposition of the mystical passage of the mystic doctrines found in the merkabah passages, while justifying this &quot;crossing of the line&quot; from hints to direct instruction. Maimonides explains basic mystical concepts via the Biblical terms referring to Spheres, elements and Intelligences. In these chapters, however, there is still very little in terms of direct explanation.

===The Four Worlds of Kabbalah===

Kabbalah relates the Merkabah vision of Ezekiel and the Throne vision of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1–8) describing the &quot;seraph&quot; angels, to its comprehensive Four Worlds. The highest World, &quot;Atziluth&quot; (&quot;Emanation&quot;—Divine wisdom), is the realm of absolute Divine manifestation without self-awareness, metaphorically described in the vision as the likeness of a Man on the throne. The throne of sapphire is an etymological root in Kabbalah for the &quot;Sephirot&quot; divine powers. The second World, &quot;Beriah&quot; (&quot;Creation&quot;—Divine understanding), is the first independent root creation, the realm of the Throne, denoting God descending into Creation, as a king limits his true greatness and revealed posture when seated. The World of &quot;Beriah&quot; is the realm of the higher angels, the &quot;Seraphim&quot; (&quot;burning&quot; in ascent and descent as their understanding of God motivates self-annihilation). The third World, &quot;Yetzirah&quot; (&quot;Formation&quot;—Divine emotions), is the realm of archetypal existence, the abode of the main &quot;Hayyot&quot; angels (&quot;alive&quot; with divine emotion). They are described with faces of a lion, ox and eagle, as their emotional nature is instinctive like animals, and they are the archetypal origins of creatures in this World. The lowest World, &quot;Assiah&quot; (&quot;Action&quot;—Divine rulership), is the realm guided by the lower channels of the &quot;Ophanim&quot; (humble &quot;ways&quot; in realised creation).

The Rabbinic Talmud compares Ezekiel and Isaiah&#x27;s visions of God&#x27;s Chariot-Throne, noticing that Ezekiel gives a lengthy account of details, while Isaiah is very brief. It gives an exoteric explanation for this; Isaiah prophesied in the era of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, Ezekiel&#x27;s vision took place in the exile of Babylonian captivity. Rava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God, this is not because he had seen more than Isaiah, but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar. Ezekiel, like all prophets except Moses, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.

The Kabbalistic account explains this difference in terms of the Four Worlds. All prophecy emanates from the divine &quot;chokmah&quot; (wisdom) realm of &quot;Atziluth&quot;. However, in order to be perceived it descends to be enclothed in vessels of lower Worlds. Isaiah&#x27;s prophecy saw the merkabah in the World of &quot;Beriah&quot; divine understanding, restraining his explanation by realising the inadequacy of description. Ezekiel saw the merkabah in the lower World of &quot;Yetzirah&quot; divine emotions, causing him to describe the vision in rapturous detail.

The two visions also form the &quot;Kedushah&quot; Jewish daily liturgy:


According to the Kabbalistic explanation, the &quot;Seraphim&quot; (&quot;burning&quot; angels) in &quot;Beriah&quot; (divine understanding) realise their distance from the absolute divinity of &quot;Atziluth&quot;. Their call, &quot;Holy&quot;, repeated three times, means removed or separated. This causes their &quot;burning up&quot; continual self-nullification, ascending to God and returning to their place. Their understanding realises instead that God&#x27;s true purpose (glory) for creation is with lowly man. The lower &quot;Hayyot&quot; (&quot;living&quot; angels) in &quot;Yetzirah&quot; (divine emotions) say, &quot;Blessed [etymologically in Kabbalah &quot;drawing down&quot; blessing] be the glory ... from His [distant-unknown to them] place&quot; of &quot;Atziluth&quot;. Though lower than the &quot;Seraphim&quot;, their emotional self-awareness has a superior advantage of powerful desire. This causes them to be able to draw down divine vitality from a higher source, the supreme realm of &quot;Atziluth&quot;, to lower creation and man. In Ezekiel&#x27;s vision, the &quot;Hayyot&quot; have a central role in the merkabah&#x27;s channeling of the divine flow in creation.

===Hasidic explanation===
Hasidic thought explains Kabbalah in terms of human psychology. Through this, the merkabah is a multi-layered analogy that offers insight into the nature of man, the ecosystem, the world, and teaches self-refinement.

The four &quot;Hayyot&quot; angels represent the basic archetypes that God used to create the current nature of the world. &quot;Ophanim&quot;, which means &quot;ways&quot;, are the ways these archetypes combine to create actual entities that exist in the world. For instance, in the basic elements of the world, the lion represents fire, the ox/earth, the man/water, and the eagle/air. However, in practice, everything in the world is some combination of all four, and the particular combination of each element that exist in each thing are its particular &quot;Ophanim&quot; or ways. 

The &#x27;man on the throne&#x27; in the vision of Ezekiel descriptively represents God, who is controlling everything that goes on in the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The &#x27;man on the throne&#x27;, however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.

This very lesson carries over to explain how the four basic groups of animals and the four basic archetypal philosophies and personalities reveal a higher, Godly source when one is able to read between the lines and see how these opposing forces can and do interact in harmony. A person should strive to be like a Merkaba, that is to say, he should realize all the different qualities, talents and inclinations he has (his angels). They may seem to contradict, but when one directs his life to a higher goal such as doing God&#x27;s will he (the man on the chair driving the chariot) will see how they all can work together and even complement each other. Ultimately, we should strive to realize how all of the forces in the world, though they may seem to conflict, can unite when one knows how to use them all to fulfill a higher purpose; namely to serve God.

==Christianity==
According to Timo Eskola, early Christian theology and discourse was influenced by the Jewish merkabah tradition. Similarly, Alan Segal and Daniel Boyarin regard Paul the Apostle&#x27;s accounts of his conversion experience and his ascent to the heavens (2 Corinthians 12:2–4) as the earliest first person accounts we have of a merkabah mystic in Jewish or Christian literature. Timothy Churchill has argued that Paul&#x27;s Damascus road encounter (e.g., Acts 9:1–9) does not fit the pattern of merkabah, but this experience is not described in Paul&#x27;s letters, and Acts does not claim to be a first-person account.

In Christianity, the man, lion, ox, and eagle are used as symbols for the four evangelists (or gospel-writers), and appear frequently in church decorations. These Creatures are called Zoë (or the Tetramorph), and surround the throne of God in Heaven, along with twenty-four elders and seven spirits of God (according to Revelation 4:1–11).

Warnings against children or &quot;excitable persons&quot; reading the Ezekiel story exist in some translations.

<text>Cyrille Adoula (13 September 1921 – 24 May 1978) was a Congolese trade unionist and politician. He was the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)), from 2 August 1961 until 30 June 1964.

== Early life and education ==
Cyrille Adoula was born to middle-class Bangala parents on 13 September 1921 in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo. He attended a Catholic primary school in his youth and received secondary education at St. Joseph&#x27;s Institute, graduating after five years of studies in 1941. That year he began working as a clerk for various commercial firms. He did this until 1952 when he accepted a senior position at the Belgian Congo Central Bank, becoming the first African to hold a significant post there. In 1948 he became a member of the Conseil pour le Travail et la Prevoyance Sociale Indigene.
==Career==
In 1954, Adoula joined the Belgian Socialist Party and subsequently became the representative for Action Socialiste in Léopoldville. He also enrolled in the Fédération Générale du Travail de Belgique. Once he became one of the top Congolese delegates in the association he resigned from his bank post and devoted his time to politics. In 1957 he attended the International Labour Conference in Geneva as an adviser to the Belgian delegation. At a Fédération Générale conference in 1959 he successfully lobbied for the Congolese branch of the association to become independent, subsequently becoming secretary-general of the new federation&#x27;s western chapter. In this capacity he traveled to West Germany and Israel to meet with other trade unionists and became a deputy committee member of the International Congress of Federated Trade Unions. He also cultivated a relationship with AFL–CIO unionist Irving Brown.

=== Entry into national politics, 1958-1960 ===
In October 1958 a group of Léopoldville &quot;évolués&quot; including Adoula, Patrice Lumumba, Gaston Diomi Ndongala and Joseph Iléo established the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). Diverse in membership, the party sought to peacefully achieve Congolese independence, promote the political education of the populace, and eliminate regionalism. Adoula became party vice president. While Lumumba became increasingly strident and nationalistic, Adoula remained relatively moderate. In 1959, he and Albert Kalonji made an unsuccessful attempt to oust Lumumba from the party and formed their own faction, MNC-Kalonji.

With the independence of the Republic of the Congo in the summer of 1960, Adoula became a senator in Parliament, representing the city of Coquilhatville. Though elected by the Équateur provincial assembly with the support of Parti de l&#x27;Unité Nationale, he identified himself as an independent. He requested that his membership of the International Congress of Federated Trade Unions be suspended so that he could devote his time to his new position. Nevertheless he remained well connected with trade unions and labour organisations. In the Senate&#x27;s first session on 17 June 1960, Adoula proposed a resolution which was unanimously adopted, calling for representatives of the Union of South Africa to be barred from attending the Congo&#x27;s independence celebrations due to the country&#x27;s Apartheid policy. Patrice Lumumba became Prime Minister and offered Adoula a ministerial position in his government but the latter refused to accept it. Adoula expressed his dissatisfaction with the ultimate composition of the government and told Lumumba that he had erred in choosing to be Prime Minister of a cabinet, which faced heavy criticism from different circles.

The Congo fell into disorder shortly after independence, as the army&#x27;s mutiny and the secession of the Katanga Province under Moïse Tshombe created the Congo Crisis. Adoula increasingly distanced himself from Lumumba, but continuously lobbied that the United Nations Operation in the Congo use force to put down the rebellion in the proclaimed State of Katanga. President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba in September 1960 and appointed Iléo to be his replacement, though Parliament refused to confirm him. Adoula briefly served as Iléo&#x27;s minister of interior. Lumumba was definitively removed from power and eventually killed in a coup by Colonel Joseph Mobutu, who forced a new government upon Kasa-Vubu. Adoula began attracting interest from the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a liberal, anti-communist alternative to Lumumba.

=== As prime minister, 1961-1964 ===

In early 1961, the United States began to push for an Adoula-led government. United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk directed CIA agents to ensure that Adoula would become the next Congolese prime minister. The CIA acted in concert with other Western intelligence agencies in bribing Congolese parliamentarians to support Adoula. On 1 August Adoula was appointed &quot;formateur&quot; of a new government by Kasa-Vubu. The following day he presented his government to Parliament with himself as Prime Minister. Like Lumumba had before him, Adoula also gave himself responsibility over the national defence portfolio. The government was delivered a vote of confidence in the Chamber, 121 votes to none with one abstention, and the Senate voiced its support via acclamation.

Adoula managed to balance his cabinet with many former Lumumba supporters. Antoine Gizenga became deputy prime minister. Still, as his tenure progressed, Adoula faced a growing amount of opposition from the nationalist elements of MNC-Lumumba and Gizenga&#x27;s faction of the Parti Solidaire Africain. He also never garnered much popular support across the country. As 1961 drew to a close, several Lumumba sympathisers withdrew from Adoula&#x27;s government and Gizenga retired to Stanleyville. Gizenga&#x27;s persisting counter-government in the east represented the first major challenge to Adoula&#x27;s authority. In January 1962, Adoula was able to successfully arrest Gizenga. He subsequently removed the remaining Lumumba supporters from his government, thereby excluding the largest political force in the country from power.

During his inaugural address following his investiture, Adoula had declared that his government would &quot;take adequate measures permitting each region to administer itself according to its own profound aspirations&quot;. Legislative efforts to achieve the goal immediately began, but faced strong opposition from the Lumumbist bloc, which felt that the Katanga problem should be resolved before any discussion concerning the division of the provinces.

==== Foreign policy ====
On the international level, Adoula pursued a policy of neutrality. On 4 September 1961 he attended the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade that resulted in the foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement. Following the end of the Katangese secession, he in earnest attempted to develop the Congo&#x27;s foreign relations, particularly with other African states in a Pan-African image. As part of this, he supported decolonisation in southern Africa. 

Adoula denounced Portuguese rule in neighboring Angola, which won him favour from the Afro-Asian bloc of non-aligned states. He actively supported the Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola (FNLA) resistance group throughout his tenure and allowed it to maintain a base in the Congo near the southern border. This was in part attributed to his longstanding personal friendship with FNLA President Holden Roberto; the two had previously been teammates for the Congolese football side Daring Club Motema Pembe. Adoula also had an interest in winning the support of Angolan refugees in Léopoldville, which grew in number after 1961. Furthermore, he hoped to undermine the Portuguese colonial authorities, which were rumored to be supporting Tshombe&#x27;s efforts in mid-1963 to dislodge his administration. In November of that year his government forced one of the FNLA&#x27;s chief rivals, the Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola, to close its Léopoldville offices and drove its leadership out of the city.

Under Adoula, the Congo joined the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East and Central Africa. He agreed to supply funds to various liberation movements in southern Africa and arranged for an office building dubbed the &quot;House of African Nationalists&quot; to be opened in Léopoldville for their use. Despite this, the funds never proved forthcoming and the liberation movements struggled with logistics and organisation.

==== Attempted post-secession reconciliation and communist rebellion ====
Following the defeat of Katanga, Adoula organised a new &quot;Government of Reconciliation&quot; in April 1963.

From Gizenga&#x27;s arrest in early 1962 until Parliament&#x27;s adjournment in September 1963, most of the dissent Adoula faced from the left came in the form of obstructionist activities in the legislative process. In October the radical Comité National de Libération (CNL) formed in Brazzaville with the goal of overthrowing Adoula&#x27;s government. By December a CNL-instigated revolt had emerged in Kwilu Province. The larger Simba rebellion of 1964 saw much of the eastern Congo overrun by leftist guerrilla forces. During the run-up to new elections in the summer, three new political coalitions in the country emerged. One of these was the Rassemblement des démocrates congolaise (RADECO), which consisted of 50 small organisations led by Jacques Massa. Centrist in ideology, it failed to amass much popular support. Adoula was elected as its president on 14 June. Still unable to contain the leftist insurrections, Adoula was forced by Kasa-Vubu to resign. He then voluntarily left the country.

== Later life, 1965-1978 ==

In a New Year&#x27;s message at the beginning of 1965, Prime Minister Moise Tshombe, Adoula&#x27;s replacement, rejected conciliation with the rebels and called for their total defeat. Adoula dissented and put forth his own &quot;African Plan&quot; for the Congo in the weekly &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot;. He insisted that any long term solution for peace and stability required input from rebel leaders, emphasizing that since their defeat would require the use of European mercenaries, acting to suppress them would only increase the Congo&#x27;s reliance on external forces. He also accused Tshombe of antagonizing opposition and called for the creation of a transitional government to oversee a settlement without him. Tshombe responded by blaming the conflict on Adoula, accusing him of weakening the central government and Balkanising the country by dividing the six original provinces into 22 new ones.

In November 1965, Adoula returned to the Congo after Mobutu had seized power. He was accommodating of Mobutu&#x27;s new regime and served as the Congolese Ambassador to the United States and Ambassador to Belgium. In 1969 he became Foreign Minister. He fell ill in May 1970. Mobutu took charge of the portfolio and Adoula retired from politics. 

== Personal life, beliefs and death==

In 1978 Adoula suffered a heart attack and went to Lausanne, Switzerland for treatment. He succumbed to an illness and died there on 24 May 1978.

Adoula was an anti-clerical and a socialist. He was well known publicly for his belief in socialism, but it was non-Marxist in nature; he was an anti-communist. In December 1957 he explained his beliefs to &quot;Présence Africaine&quot;:

&quot;Being a Socialist, I am for the transformation of the present society into one benefiting the entire collectivity. And for this, I conceive the collectivization of the means of production and the lower echelon workers of the latter. In order to attain this goal, I only see one means: the struggle of the classes, the permanent class struggle until this result is obtained.&quot;
Adoula&#x27;s son, Doudou (1965–2024), became known as an atalaku in Zaïko Langa Langa, one of the leading bands in Africa. Over his 35-year tenure, he became a key figure in the ensemble.

== Legacy ==
In most written histories Adoula is portrayed as a weak, ineffective prime minister and a lackey of the United States government.

<text>Napoléon Lajoie (; September 5, 1874 – February 7, 1959), also known as Larry Lajoie, was an American professional baseball second baseman who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Nicknamed &quot;the Frenchman&quot;, he represented both Philadelphia franchises and the Cleveland Naps, the latter of which he became the namesake of, and from 1905 through 1909, the player-manager.

Lajoie was signed to the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League (NL) in 1896. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, the upstart American League (AL) was looking to rival the supremacy of the NL and in 1901, Lajoie and dozens of former National League players joined the American League. National League clubs contested the legality of contracts signed by players who jumped to the other league, but eventually Lajoie was allowed to play for Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics. During the season, Lajoie set the all-time American League single-season mark for the highest batting average (.426). One year later, Lajoie went to the Cleveland Bronchos, where he would play until the 1915 season, when he returned to play for Mack and the Athletics. While with Cleveland, Lajoie&#x27;s popularity led to locals electing to change the club&#x27;s team name from Bronchos to Napoleons (&quot;Naps&quot; for short), which remained until after Lajoie departed Cleveland and the name was changed to Indians (the team&#x27;s name until 2021).

Lajoie led the AL in batting average five times in his career and four times recorded the highest number of hits. During several of those years with the Naps, he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other, most notably in 1910, when the league&#x27;s batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson. Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits. He led the NL or AL in putouts five times in his career and in assists three times. He has been called &quot;the best second baseman in the history of baseball&quot; and &quot;the most outstanding player to wear a Cleveland uniform.&quot; Cy Young said, &quot;Lajoie was one of the most rugged players I ever faced. He&#x27;d take your leg off with a line drive, turn the third baseman around like a swinging door and powder the hand of the left fielder.&quot; In 1937, Lajoie was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Lajoie was born on September 5, 1874, in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, to Jean Baptiste and Celina Guertin Lajoie. Jean Lajoie was French-Canadian and had immigrated to the United States. Upon arrival to the U.S., he first settled in Rutland, Vermont, but then moved to Woonsocket, where Nap, the youngest of eight surviving children, was born. Throughout his childhood Lajoie received little formal education.

Jean, who worked as a teamster and laborer, died not long into Lajoie&#x27;s childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team, under the alias &quot;Sandy&quot; because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called &quot;Slugging Cabby.&quot; &quot;When I told my father I had decided to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined to give it a try at least one season,&quot; Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname &quot;Larry&quot; from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.

When word of Lajoie&#x27;s baseball ability spread, he began to play for other semi-professional teams at $2 to $5 per game ($ to $ in current dollar terms). He also worked as a teamster. He left Woonsocket and his $7.50 per week ($ in current dollar terms) working as a taxi driver and joined the Class B New England League&#x27;s Fall River Indians in 1896. Lajoie played as a center fielder, first baseman and catcher, earning $25 weekly ($ in current dollar terms). He recorded 163 hits in 80 games and led the team in batting average, doubles, triples, home runs and hits. Lajoie was &quot;widely regarded as an outstanding prospect,&quot; and Indians owner Charlie Marston rejected an offer from the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lajoie in exchange for $500 ($ in current dollar terms). He was also scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Beaneaters.

==Major league career==

===Philadelphia Phillies===
The Philadelphia Phillies of the MLB&#x27;s National League (NL) purchased Lajoie and teammate Phil Geier from Fall River for $1,500 ($ in current dollar terms) on August 9. Phillies&#x27; manager Billy Nash originally went to Fall River intending to sign Geier only but obtained Lajoie when the team agreed to include him in their asking price. Author David Jordan wrote:

A legend later grew up that Geier was the main target of Nash&#x27;s pursuit and that Marston &quot;threw in&quot; Lajoie in order to get the Phillies to pay the $1,500 asking price. This is hardly likely. While Geier was considered a good prospect, Lajoie was banging the ball at a .429 clip in his first professional season, was a fine fielder, and had already been sought by several big league clubs. Nap Lajoie clearly represented a financial asset to Marston, who did not give him away. The price the Phillies paid was a substantial sum for two minor leaguers in 1896.

Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie made his major league debut. He played first base and recorded a single. Ed Delahanty was being considered to play the first base position after Dan Brouthers retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, &quot;Look, sonny, you tell the boss you&#x27;re a first baseman and you and me are gonna get along.&quot; Lajoie became the team&#x27;s first baseman, and by the end of the season he and Delahanty were roommates. Later in 1898, new manager George Stallings moved Lajoie to second base, commenting, &quot;[Lajoie would] have made good no matter where I positioned him.&quot;

Lajoie hit .363 and led the NL in slugging percentage in 1897 and doubles and RBIs in 1898. He had a .378 batting average in 1899, though he played only 77 games due to an injury. In 1900, he missed five weeks due to a broken thumb suffered in a fistfight with teammate Elmer Flick.

In April 1900, Brooklyn manager Ned Hanlon made a public offer of $10,000 to purchase Lajoie from the Phillies which would be rebuffed by the Phillies owners.

John Rogers, described as a &quot;penny-pinching&quot; majority owner of the Phillies, assured Lajoie that he would make the same salary as Delahanty. However, Lajoie discovered that while he was earning $2,600 ($ in current dollar terms), Delahanty earned $3,000 ($ in current dollar terms) (contracts for NL players were not allowed to surpass $2,400). Rogers increased Lajoie&#x27;s pay by $200 but the damage had already been done. &quot;Because I felt I had been cheated, I was determined to listen to any reasonable American League offer,&quot; Lajoie said.

===Philadelphia Athletics===
In 1901, the newly created American League had attracted several of the top players in the competing National League to join its ranks. Rogers declined Lajoie&#x27;s request for an increase in salary, and as a result Lajoie jumped to the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics, owned by former Phillies&#x27; part-owner Benjamin Shibe and managed by Connie Mack. Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of Mack. &quot;Hough offered me $24,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for four years. You can bet I signed in a hurry,&quot; Lajoie said. Lajoie was considered &quot;the first superstar&quot; to join the newly formed AL. He was also the first player whose yearly salary was $4,000 ($ in current dollar terms). &quot;The Phillies opened their season and drew 6,000 fans. A week later, when we opened, there were 16,000 in the stands. The American League was here to stay,&quot; Lajoie later said. Lajoie&#x27;s batting average that year was .426 (due to a transcription error that was not discovered until 1954, which inaccurately gave his hit total as 220 instead of 229, it was originally recorded at .405, later changed to .422, before finally being revised again to .426). The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with having the AL&#x27;s all-time mark. That same year in a game against the Chicago White Sox&#x27;s Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer after Abner Dalrymple in 1881 to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 11–7 game. For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average (.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics&#x27; record. Mack said of Lajoie, &quot;He plays so naturally and so easily it looks like lack of effort.&quot; Author Robert Kelly writes:

The batting average of Lajoie still stands as an AL record. To some degree, however, it is tainted. The 1901 season was the first for the AL and the level of competition was presumably evolving. Such questions, however, in no way cast doubt on the extraordinary batting ability of the second baseman.&quot;

In April 1902, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overruled an earlier decision by the Court of Common Pleas and upheld the reserve clause in contracts between players and NL clubs. President of the Chicago National League Club Jim Hart said the state Supreme Court&#x27;s decision had dealt &quot;a fatal blow to the rival league&quot; and NL clubs &quot;have won a great victory.&quot; The Phillies&#x27; Rogers obtained an injunction barring Lajoie from playing baseball for any team other than his team. However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction was enforceable only in the state of Pennsylvania. The courts ruled that the reserve clause was not valid for players who signed with an AL team. Mack responded by trading Lajoie and Bill Bernhard to the then-moribund Cleveland Bronchos, whose owner, Charles Somers, had provided considerable financial assistance to the A&#x27;s in the early years. Lajoie was also pursued by Charles Comiskey, owner of the Chicago White Sox.

===Cleveland Bronchos/Naps===

Lajoie, nicknamed &quot;The Frenchman&quot; and considered baseball&#x27;s most famous player at the time, arrived in Cleveland on June 4; his play was immediately met with approval from fans. The Bronchos drew 10,000 fans to League Park in Lajoie&#x27;s first game. The Bronchos&#x27; record at the time Lajoie and fellow Athletics teammate, Bill Bernhard, joined was 11–24 and improved to 12–24 after the team&#x27;s inaugural game with their new players, a 4–3 win over the Boston Americans. The team went on to finish 69–67, fifth in the AL, for the franchise&#x27;s first winning record since the AL began as a league. After his first season with the Bronchos, Lajoie&#x27;s .378 average led all AL players. New York Giants manager, John McGraw, was rumored to want to sign Lajoie, but Lajoie said &quot;... I intend to stick to Cleveland.&quot;

For the remainder of 1902 and most of 1903, Lajoie and Elmer Flick traveled separately from the rest of the team, needing to avoid entering Pennsylvania so as to avoid a subpoena (the only team they could legally play with inside state limits was the Phillies). When the Naps (the team was temporarily named the Naps after Nap Lajoie) went to play in Philadelphia, Lajoie and Bernhard would go to nearby Atlantic City to help pass the time. The issue was finally resolved when the leagues made peace through the National Agreement in September 1903 (which also brought the formation of the World Series). To begin the 1903 season, the club changed its name from the Bronchos to the Naps in honor of Lajoie after a readers&#x27; poll result was released by the &quot;Cleveland Press&quot;. (The team was officially the Blues in their inaugural AL season but changed to the Bronchos for the 1902 season.) The Bronchos finished the season 77–63 and Lajoie finished his first full season with the club again the AL&#x27;s batting champion with a .344 average. He also led the league in slugging percentage (.518), finished second in doubles (41), third in RBIs (93) and tied for fifth in home runs (7). In the off-season he contracted pleurisy.

During the 1904 season, Lajoie received a suspension after he spat tobacco juice in an umpire&#x27;s eye. He later informally replaced Bill Armour as the team&#x27;s manager (Armour submitted his resignation on September 9 but as team captain, Lajoie had already been acting as the Naps&#x27; field manager). After the season had concluded, Lajoie was officially named manager. He still managed to lead the majors with a .376 batting average as he recorded his second consecutive league batting title. He also led the majors in hits (208), doubles (49), RBIs (102) and slugging percentage (.546). Lajoie forbade his players from card playing and gambling during the regular season. As a manager, Lajoie was also described as &quot;much too lenient with his players.&quot;

Lajoie contracted sepsis from an untreated spike injury after a game in July 1905. Dye from Lajoie&#x27;s stockings entered his bloodstream and led to blood poisoning. (A rule was put into place requiring white socks to be worn underneath a player&#x27;s colored socks.) The injury worsened and Lajoie eventually came to games in a wheelchair, and doctors considered amputation. The injury and illness kept Lajoie out until August 28, when he returned as the team&#x27;s first baseman. Near the end of the season he sustained an injury to his ankle from a foul tip during an at bat, and did not play for the remainder of the season but continued to manage from the bench. He finished the season having only appeared in 65 games (a career-low, other than his rookie season when he was not called up until well after the season had begun). The Naps finished with a 76–78 record in a season in which they had been 52–29, and held a three-game lead in the American League on July 24 Baseball historian Bill James wrote of Lajoie&#x27;s higher-than-normal career putout total and importance to Cleveland:

Nap Lajoie was not only the team&#x27;s superstar, after 1905 he was also the manager. He was more than that—hell, the team was actually called the &quot;Naps&quot; in his honor, as if Lajoie &quot;was&quot; the team. If Lajoie was in the habit of covering second base every play, the shortstop certainly wasn&#x27;t going to tell him not to.
Lajoie led the majors in 1906 in hits (214) and doubles (48) and the Naps finished third in the AL again with a winning record, 89–64. Lajoie finished second in the AL to George Stone in batting average, slugging and on-base percentage. In 1906 he married Myrtle Smith and the couple moved to a small farm outside Cleveland.

In June of the 1907 season, Lajoie&#x27;s .296 average, &quot;an average even now that scores of players would be glad to accept,&quot; put him at risk for hitting below .300 for the first time in his career. He also missed 15 games due to a recurrence of sepsis. Lajoie and Naps first baseman George Stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and Stovall broke a chair over Lajoie&#x27;s head. &quot;George didn&#x27;t mean anything by it,&quot; Lajoie said, and the two maintained a working relationship. He finished the season with an average of .301. Naps owner Charles Somers received a trade offer from the Detroit Tigers for Flick and the Tigers&#x27; Ty Cobb. Tigers manager Hughie Jennings called Somers and told him he was offering the trade because Cobb was not getting along with several teammates. Somers decided to retain Flick, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll keep Flick. Maybe he isn&#x27;t as good a batter as Cobb, but he&#x27;s much nicer to have on the team.&quot; The Naps finished the regular season in second place to the Tigers with a 90–64 record, a half-game behind the Tigers (who finished 90–63 and were not forced to make-up a rained out game in accordance with league rules). Lajoie was partly blamed for the Naps&#x27; second-place finish. Author Fred McMane described an instance during the season between Naps catcher Nig Clarke and Lajoie.

Clarke ... was newly married and asked Lajoie for a day off so that he could go home. Lajoie refused. Clarke sulked and walked over to warm up pitcher Addie Joss. On the first pitch, he stuck out a finger and the ball broke it cleanly. With blood streaming from his hand, Clarke waved it defiantly in front of Lajoie. &quot;Now can I go home?&quot; asked Clarke. He was out five weeks, and Cleveland lost the pennant to Detroit by half a game.

Lajoie finished the season tied for third-most in hits (168) while Cobb&#x27;s batting average, slugging and on-base percentages, and hit total led the American League. Baseball historians have suggested the managerial duties Lajoie took on affected his offensive numbers.

Lajoie&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the Naps&#x27; play worsened. &quot;You can&#x27;t win in the major leagues unless you have players who know the game. We don&#x27;t have time to teach and train youngsters up here. Our job is to win pennants, not run schools,&quot; he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote &quot;Lajoie, in spite of his marvelous fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager.&quot; Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon &quot;Jim&quot; McGuire to manager. The team finished 71–82 while Lajoie&#x27;s .324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 71–81 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a .384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie&#x27;s 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club&#x27;s manager and the Naps finished 80–73. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team&#x27;s fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 75–78. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a .368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit .335 on the year, the last time he would hit over .300 in his career.

Only two other major league players had attained 3,000 career hits until Lajoie hit a double on September 27, 1914, and so joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner in the 3,000 hit club. Lajoie recorded the hit off Yankees pitcher Marty McHale in a 5–3 Naps win. His .258 batting average for the season, however, was the lowest since he had joined the majors in 1896. The Naps finished in last place in the American League standings with a 51–102 record, their worst record since joining the league and the franchise&#x27;s lowest winning percentage (.333). Lajoie requested that Somers trade him and the club obliged, selling Lajoie to the Athletics for the waiver price and in so doing, Lajoie returned to Philadelphia.

===Philadelphia Athletics (second stint)===
The following season, 1915, Lajoie returned to the Athletics when Mack signed him to a contract. In his first season back with the Athletics, he finished with a .280 batting average but the team ended the season in last place with a 43–109 record. The 1916 season would be Lajoie&#x27;s last in the majors. In his final major league game, he hit a triple to help Athletics pitcher Joe Bush win his no-hitter. Lajoie, aged 41 years, played in 113 games and finished with a .246 average. Philadelphia&#x27;s season record was worse than the previous season&#x27;s franchise-low record, and the team finished in last place again with a 36–117 record. The Athletics&#x27; winning percentage (.235) is the franchise&#x27;s worst winning percentage (through the 2021 season); moreover, it is the lowest of any major league team in the modern (post-1900) era.

===Minor leagues and retirement===
In 1917, Lajoie joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League as manager. At the age of 42, Lajoie won the league&#x27;s batting title with batting average of .380. He appeared in 151 of 156 games and, for the first time in his career, played on a team that won a pennant. He later was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers for $3,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in March 1918 but the contract was annulled by the Commissioner&#x27;s office and made a free agent to which Lajoie was &quot;well pleased&quot;. Later that same year he joined the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association as player-manager. He helped lead the team to a third-place finish but the season was impacted due to the U.S.&#x27;s involvement in World War I. Lajoie made his services available to the draft board but they rejected his offer. On December 27, 1918, Lajoie announced his retirement from baseball.

Several years after his retirement, a story in &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; talked of Lajoie&#x27;s ability to &quot;outguess any pitcher.&quot; Lajoie faced pitcher Red Donahue, who avoided pitching fastballs to Lajoie after seeing him go 4-for-4 against a fellow pitcher. Donahue instead made pitches on the outside corner, to which Lajoie reached over &quot;and hit them with ease.&quot; Donahue then aimed a pitch at Lajoie&#x27;s head and he proceeded to hit a home run. &quot;That&#x27;s the kind I eat&quot;, he said.

==Managerial record==
==Rivalry with Ty Cobb==
For the first part of the 20th century, Lajoie&#x27;s and Ty Cobb&#x27;s statistics rivaled each other like few other players in the American League. In 1908, Honus Wagner and Lajoie recorded their 2,000th career hits. Baseball historian David Anderson wrote:

Nap Lajoie reached the milestone later in the summer with even less hoopla, in an age when individual records received little attention from the press and were generally scorned by many players. Players overly worried about their individual stats were often unpopular with teammates. The modesty of Wagner and Lajoie over their achievements contrasted sharply with Cobb&#x27;s ambition and overriding interest in his individual numbers.
The Lajoie-Cobb rivalry reached a peak in 1910, when Hugh Chalmers of the Chalmers Auto Company (a direct predecessor to modern-day Chrysler) promised a Chalmers 30 Roadster to the season&#x27;s batting champion. The public became fascinated with the daily statistics of Lajoie and Cobb in what became known as the Chalmers Race. Sports bettors, who by this time followed the sport attentively, also followed the daily reports with interest. Cobb took the final two games, a doubleheader, off against the Chicago White Sox, confident that his average was safe and would allow him to win the AL batting title—unless Lajoie had a near-perfect final day. Going into the final game of the season, Cobb&#x27;s average led Lajoie&#x27;s, .383 to .376.

Lajoie and the Naps faced a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns in Sportsman&#x27;s Park, Cleveland&#x27;s final two games of the season. After a sun-hindered fly ball went for a stand-up triple and another batted ball landed for a cleanly hit single, Lajoie had five subsequent hits – bunt singles dropped in front of rookie third baseman Red Corriden (whose normal position was shortstop), who was playing closer to shallow left field on orders, it has been suggested, of manager Jack O&#x27;Connor. In his final at bat of the second game, Lajoie reached base on another bunt but the throw to first by Corriden was off target and the play was scored an error and thus, Lajoie did not record an official at-bat, nor a hit. He finished the doubleheader 8-for-8 and his batting average increased to .384, .001 greater than Cobb&#x27;s mark. Although the AL office had not officially announced the results, Lajoie began to receive congratulations from fans and players, including eight of Cobb&#x27;s Detroit Tigers teammates. Most players in the league preferred Lajoie&#x27;s personality to that of Cobb&#x27;s. Coach Harry Howell is reported to have said to the game&#x27;s official scorer, E. V. Parish, &quot;to do well by Lajoie.&quot; Howell was reported to have offered a bribe to Parish, which as described in Al Stump&#x27;s biography of Cobb, was a $40 ($ in current dollar terms) suit. Parish refused the offer and the resulting uproar ended in O&#x27;Connor and Howell being banned from the major leagues by AL President Ban Johnson.

Johnson had the matter investigated, and after having Cobb&#x27;s September 24 doubleheader statistics re-checked, discovered only the first game of Cobb&#x27;s statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb&#x27;s suggested actual batting average at .385, again ahead of Lajoie&#x27;s. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie&#x27;s sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb&#x27;s batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie&#x27;s 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Lajoie initially refused the car, but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, &quot;I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely.&quot; Lajoie said, &quot;I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success.&quot;

&quot;The Sporting News&quot; published an article written by Paul MacFarlane in its April 18, 1981, issue where historian Pete Palmer had discovered that while Cobb&#x27;s September 24 doubleheader was not correctly tabulated (perhaps purposely) according to the correct date, the second game&#x27;s statistics were in fact included in the next day&#x27;s ledger, thus incorrectly recording a second 2-for-3 performance from Cobb which meant Lajoie&#x27;s average was greater. Author James Vail wrote in 2001:

To date, it seems that no one knows for certain who won that 1910 batting title. &quot;Total Baseball&quot;, which is now the official major-league record, lists both men at .384 in its seasonal section, but its player register has Lajoie at the same number and Cobb at .383—so even the various editors of that source do not, or cannot, agree.

Jon Wertheim wrote in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; 100 years after the event,

The statistics for the Detroit players had been crossed out and nullified. Every Detroit player, that is, except one: Ty Cobb. It takes something less than a detective to arrive at the conclusion that at some point Johnson (or someone in the league office, anyway) realized the error and decided to conceal it.

==Legacy==

Lajoie ended his career with a lifetime .338 batting average. His career total of 3,252 hits was the second-most in MLB history at the time of his retirement, behind only Honus Wagner&#x27;s total (3,420). Lajoie&#x27;s 2,522 hits in the American League was that league&#x27;s record until Cobb surpassed his mark. He was among the second group of players elected to the Hall of Fame in 1937 and was later inducted on June 12, 1939, when the Hall opened that same year. Lajoie obtained the greatest number of votes as he led induction mates Tris Speaker (165 votes) and Cy Young (153) with 168 votes (83.6 percent of ballots) from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. Lajoie led all second basemen in the NL in putouts (1898) and the AL four times in his career (1901, 1903, 1906, and 1908). From 1906–1908 he led the AL in assists (amongst second basemen). He also led the league in double plays six times in his career. Baseball historian William McNeil rates Lajoie as the game&#x27;s greatest second baseman, when combining both offensive and defensive impact. Bill James argues, &quot;In the last 20 years several statistical analysts ... have credited Lajoie with immense defensive value ... this analysis is incorrect. He was a competent fielder, even a good fielder. He was &quot;not&quot; a defensive superstar.&quot;

During spring training before the 1928 season, Lajoie commented on the 1927 New York Yankees. &quot;Of course, you could see a lot of loafing going on but if that club is the greatest of all times, you just know that we had a lot of clubs in my time who were world champions and didn&#x27;t know it.&quot; He died in Daytona Beach, Florida on February 7, 1959, at the age of 84 from complications associated with pneumonia. He had fallen in the autumn of 1958 and fractured his arm. His wife had died earlier in 1951. In 1999, he ranked number 29 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the &quot;100 Greatest Baseball Players&quot;, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Lajoie was included in the checklist for the 1933 baseball card set produced by the Goudey Gum Company. However, the card (#106 in the set) became infamous for being impossible to find copies of. While the company eventually sent copies of the card to those collectors who wrote in to complain, it was revealed years later that the uncut sheets of the set did not include the card, and the alleged 1933 Lajoie card was printed with the 1934 set. Today, the card is among the highest value from the set.

Lajoie is mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

In Ring Lardner&#x27;s 1911 baseball song, &quot;Gee, It&#x27;s a Wonderful Game&quot;, a stanza refers to Lajoie:

Who lost out in the battle of old Waterloo?/
I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t know/
They say &#x27;twas Na-po-le-on/
Maybe it&#x27;s true/
Maybe so, I don&#x27;t know/
The pink sheets don&#x27;t print Mr. Bonaparte&#x27;s face/
No stories about him today/
&#x27;Cause he never could hold down
that old second base/
Like his name sake/
Big Nap Lay&#x27;-ooh-way

Lajoie&#x27;s likeness made a brief cameo appearance in the 1992 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; as one of the would-be ringers for Mr. Burns&#x27; company softball team. Mr. Burns had planned to have Lajoie play second base, until his assistant Smithers points out that all of the players Mr. Burns had selected had long since retired and died.

==Footnotes==
 Major League Baseball has not revised Cobb&#x27;s batting average, which would then designate Lajoie as the 1910 batting champion. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; wrote of statistical evidence showing Cobb&#x27;s 1910 season statistics had been tampered with and he was given two extra base hits but MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn declined to announce Lajoie the winner. Both the Society for American Baseball Research and Baseball-Reference.com list Lajoie as having the higher batting average and thus, the batting champion.

<doc id="645393" wikidata="Q1175376" url="?curid=645393" title="David M. Cote">
<text>David M. Cote (born July 19, 1952) is an American businessman. Cote previously worked for General Electric and TRW Inc. before he was appointed chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Honeywell in 2002, following their acquisition by AlliedSignal. Cote also sat on the JP Morgan Chase risk committee during the period in which the firm lost $6 billion trading credit derivatives. Cote stepped down as CEO at Honeywell at the end of March 2017 and was succeeded by Darius Adamczyk. Cote is currently the executive chairman of Vertiv.

== Early life ==
Cote was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, and graduated from Pembroke Academy in Pembroke, New Hampshire, in 1970. The following year, Cote enrolled at the University of New Hampshire, and while attending UNH full-time, he worked an hourly job on the night shift at a nearby GE jet engine plant. In 1976, he graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration.

== Career ==

===General Electric===
Cote joined General Electric full-time in November 1976, and worked there for more than twenty years. He transitioned from his hourly production work at the General Electric aircraft-engine plant in New Hampshire to a full-time auditing job at another GE plant in Massachusetts. In 1985, his handling of an interaction with CEO Jack Welch became the catalyst for Cote&#x27;s advancement at GE. Welch promoted Cote three levels of management. Over his career there, he held positions in manufacturing, finance, marketing, strategic planning and general management, before becoming CEO of GE Appliances in 1996.

===TRW===
In November 1999, Cote joined TRW as president and COO where he introduced the Six Sigma management system to reduce defects in manufacturing. In February 2001, Cote was appointed CEO, and later chairman of the board. Cote led the creation of the TRW subsidiary Velocium, which manufactured ultra-high-speed semiconductors.

In February 2002, Cote announced he would be leaving TRW. Reportedly, the news surprised employees and some executives, who learned of Cote&#x27;s departure hours before the announcement.

===Honeywell===
Honeywell selected Cote as successor to Lawrence Bossidy, following the AlliedSignal acquisition of Honeywell and European Union&#x27;s rejection of Honeywell&#x27;s merger with General Electric. Cote was elected CEO, president, and a member of the board of directors on February 19, 2002. He was elected chairman of the board on July 1, 2002.

The year Cote took office, Honeywell lost $220 million. Cote instituted conservative accounting to streamline costs. In an effort to reduce the unpredictability of asbestos-plus-environmental expenses, Honeywell established a trust for claims and reclaim soil at chemical plants. As a result, that expense is consistently $150 million a year, after-tax. Honeywell saw improved quality in design, increased production, and lower production costs after it implemented a new productivity management system. During the 2008-2009 recession, the company instituted furloughs to reduce overall operating costs rather than lay off workers. While CEO of Honeywell International in 2015, Cote earned a total compensation of US$25,053,000 which included a base salary of $1,890,000, an annual bonus of $5,700,000, and $10,338,000 in stock options. During his tenure at Honeywell, the company&#x27;s donations via its political action committee rose from $200,000 in 2002 to $8 million in 2014. 

Cote stepped down as CEO at Honeywell at the end of March 2017 and was succeeded by Darius Adamczyk. Cote continued as executive chairman through April 2018.

===Vertiv===
Since February 7, 2020, Cote has been the executive chairman of Vertiv.

==Appointments==
===Banking===
Cote was a member of the board of directors at JPMorgan Chase and an advisor to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). In 2012, Cote came under criticism as one of the three members of JP Morgan Chase&#x27;s risk committee, after CEO Jamie Dimon said on May 10, 2012, that the firm&#x27;s chief investment office suffered a $2 billion loss trading credit derivatives. Commentators identified a lack of relevant expertise among the members of the committee, identifying Cote and a museum official who also served, in particular for their lack of banking experience.

In February 2014 it was announced that Cote would fill a vacancy on the board of the New York Federal Reserve. Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, raised doubts about the suitability of Cote&#x27;s appointment, noting the &quot;systematic breakdown of compliance and risk control&quot; during the period when Cote was on the board of JPMorgan Chase, whilst also noting that some, but not all, of the problems there pre-dated Cote&#x27;s appointment. The election papers did not mention Cote&#x27;s role at JPMorgan Chase in his candidate C.V. Cote stepped down from the board of New York Federal Reserve in March 2018.

===Government===

In 2010, President Obama named Cote as one of the chief executives he most admired. In 2009, Cote was invited to the White House to meet the President for a briefing on the US economic recovery plan and in November 2009, he was one of 12 businesspeople asked by the White House to host the US-India CEO Forum, which Cote and Ratan Tata co-chaired. In February 2010, Cote was selected by President Obama to be on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, more commonly known as the Simpson Bowles Commission.

===Other===
Cote was a member of the executive committee of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012.

==Attitude to deficit reduction==
Cote is a co-founder of Fix the Debt, a group of executives and former legislators who campaign for deficit reduction and tax reform. In a 2013 interview with the &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot;, Cote identified the problem of debt reduction in the United States as being the fact that &quot;Washington is ruled by fear of voters ... and the three &#x27;h&#x27;s&#x27; prevail—hysteria, histrionics and hyperbole&quot;. He also framed the options for deficit reduction in terms of either increases in taxes or a reduction in social security benefits, saying, &quot;If you have people saying, &#x27;Don&#x27;t raise my taxes, but don&#x27;t cut my benefits,&#x27; it makes it really difficult to get anything done.&quot;

In 2013, during negotiations over the Federal deficit during which some Republicans threatened a default, one lobbyist was quoted as identifying &quot;the rise of an ideological wing [within the Republican Party] that is now willing to stand up to business interests&quot;. Cote was quoted as saying &quot;It&#x27;s clearly this faction within the Republican Party that&#x27;s causing the issue right now&quot; which was interpreted by OpenSecrets.org as an implied threat that if the dissident Republicans did not co-operate, contributions from Honeywell&#x27;s Political Action Committee could be cut. In 2012, Honeywell&#x27;s PAC and employees made political donations of about $5.3 million to candidates and committees.

In March 2014, Cote presented his views on deficit reduction and American competitiveness to the House Committee on Financial Services of the United States House of Representatives.

<doc id="645396" wikidata="Q1179217" url="?curid=645396" title="Morgan horse">
<text>The Morgan horse is one of the earliest horse breeds developed in the United States. Tracing back to the foundation sire Figure, later named Justin Morgan after his best-known owner, Morgans served many roles in 19th-century American history, being used as coach horses and for harness racing, as general riding animals, and as cavalry horses during the American Civil War on both sides of the conflict. Morgans have influenced other major American breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, Tennessee Walking Horse and the Standardbred. During the 19th and 20th centuries, they were exported to other countries, including England, where a Morgan stallion influenced the breeding of the Hackney horse. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm near Middlebury, Vermont for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed; the farm was later transferred to the University of Vermont. The first breed registry was established in 1909, and since then many organizations in the US, Europe and Oceania have developed. There were estimated to be over 175,000 Morgan horses worldwide in 2005.

The Morgan is a compact, refined breed, generally bay, black or chestnut in color, although they come in many colors, including several variations of pinto. Used in both English and Western disciplines, the breed is known for its versatility. The Morgan is the state animal of Vermont and the state horse of Massachusetts and the state mammal of Rhode Island. Popular children&#x27;s authors, including Marguerite Henry and Ellen Feld, have portrayed the breed in their books; Henry&#x27;s &quot;Justin Morgan Had a Horse&quot; was later made into a Disney movie.

==Breed characteristics==

There is officially one breed standard for the Morgan type, regardless of the discipline or bloodline of the individual horse. Compact and refined in build, the Morgan has strong legs, an expressive head with a straight or slightly convex profile and broad forehead; large, prominent eyes; well-defined withers, laid back shoulders, and an upright, well arched neck. The back is short, and hindquarters are strongly muscled, with a long and well-muscled croup. The tail is attached high and carried gracefully and straight. Morgans appear to be a strong powerful horse, and the breed is well known as an easy keeper. The breed standard for height ranges from , with some individuals over and under.

Gaits, particularly the trot are &quot;animated, elastic, square, and collected,&quot; with the front and rear legs balanced. A few Morgans are gaited, meaning they can perform an intermediate speed gait other than the trot such as the rack, fox trot, or pace. The United States Equestrian Federation states, &quot;a Morgan is distinctive for its stamina and vigor, personality and eagerness and strong natural way of moving.&quot; The breed has a reputation for intelligence, courage and a good disposition. Registered Morgans come in a variety of colors although they are most commonly bay, black, and chestnut. Less common colors include gray, roan, dun, silver dapple, and cream dilutions such as palomino, buckskin, cremello and perlino. In addition, three pinto color patterns are also recognized: sabino, frame overo, and splashed white. The tobiano pattern has not been noted in Morgans.

One genetic disease has been identified within the Morgan breed. This is Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy, an autosomal dominant muscle disease found mainly in stock horse and draft horse breeds caused by a missense mutation in the GYS1 gene. Morgans are one of over a dozen breeds found to have the allele for the condition, though its prevalence in Morgans appears to be quite low compared to stock and draft breeds. In one study, less than one percent of randomly tested Morgans carried the allele for this condition, one of the lowest percentages amongst breeds in that study.

Two coat color genes found in Morgans have also been linked to genetic disorders. One is the genetic ocular syndrome multiple congenital ocular anomalies (MCOA), originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). MCOA is characterized by the abnormal development of some ocular tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form; the disease is non-progressive. Genetic studies have shown that it is closely tied to the silver dapple gene. A small number of Morgans carry the silver dapple allele, which causes cysts but no apparent vision problems if heterozygous, but when homozygous can cause vision problems. There is also the possibility of lethal white syndrome, a fatal disease seen in foals who are homozygous for the frame overo gene. At present, there is one mare line in the Morgan breed that has produced healthy heterozygous frame overo individuals. The American Morgan Horse Association advocates genetic testing to identify carriers of these genetics, and advises owners to avoid breeding horses that are heterozygous for frame overo to each other.

==Breed history==
===Justin Morgan===

All Morgans trace back to a single foundation sire, a stallion named Figure, who was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts in 1789. In 1792, he was given to a man named Justin Morgan as a debt payment. The horse later came to be identified by the name of this particular owner, and &quot;the Justin Morgan horse&quot; evolved into the name of the breed. Figure is thought to have stood about , and to have weighed about . He was known for his , passing on his distinctive looks, conformation, temperament, and athleticism. His exact pedigree is unknown, although extensive efforts have been made to discover his parentage. One historian notes that the writings on the possibility of his sire being a Thoroughbred named Beautiful Bay would &quot;fill 41 detective novels and a membership application for the Liars&#x27; Club.&quot; In 1821, Figure was kicked by another horse and later died of his injuries. He was buried in Tunbridge, Vermont.

Although Figure was used extensively as a breeding stallion, records are known to exist for only six of his sons, three of whom became notable as foundation bloodstock for the Morgan breed. Woodbury, a chestnut, stood high and stood for many years at stud in New England. Bulrush, a dark bay the same size as Figure, was known for his endurance and speed in harness. Best known was Sherman, another chestnut stallion, slightly shorter than Figure, who in turn was the sire and grandsire of Black Hawk and Ethan Allen. Black Hawk, born in 1833, went on to become a foundation stallion for the Standardbred, American Saddlebred and Tennessee Walking Horse breeds, and was known for his unbeaten harness racing record. Ethan Allen, sired by Black Hawk in 1849, is another important sire in the history of the Morgan breed, and was known for his speed in trotting races.

===Breed development===

In the 19th century, Morgans were recognized for their utilitarian capabilities. They were used extensively for harness racing, as well as for pulling coaches, due to the breed&#x27;s speed and endurance in harness. They were also used as stock horses and for general riding, as well as light driving work. Miners in the California Gold Rush (1848–1855) used the breed, as did the Army during and after the American Civil War for both riding and harness horses.

The Morgan trotting stallion Shepherd F. Knapp was exported to England in the 1860s, where his trotting ability influenced the breeding of Hackney horses. During this period, numerous Morgan mares may have been brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced the development of the American Quarter Horse breed. The Morgan horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas. 

Daniel Chipman Linsley, a native of Middlebury, Vermont, compiled a book of Morgan breeding stallions, published in 1857. Colonel Joseph Battell, also a Middlebury, Vermont native, published the first volume of the Morgan Horse Register in 1894, marking the beginning of a formal breed registry. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce horses that were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, and capable of performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from the USDA to the Vermont Agricultural College (now the University of Vermont).

===Military use===
Morgans were used as cavalry mounts by both sides in the American Civil War. Horses with Morgan roots included Sheridan&#x27;s Winchester, also known as Rienzi, (a descendant of Black Hawk). Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Little Sorrel&quot; has alternately been described as a Morgan or an American Saddlebred, a breed heavily influenced by the Morgan. While Morgan enthusiasts have stated that the horse Comanche, the only survivor of the Custer regiment after the Battle of the Little Big Horn, was either a Morgan or a Mustang/Morgan mix, records of the U.S. Army and other early sources do not support this. Most accounts state that Comanche was either of &quot;Mustang lineage&quot; or a mix of &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Spanish&quot; blood. The University of Kansas Natural History Museum, which has the stuffed body of Comanche on display, makes no statement as to his breed. All sources agree that Comanche originated in the Oklahoma or Texas area, making his Mustang background more likely.
===Families===
There are four main bloodlines groups within the Morgan breed today, known as the Brunk, Government, Lippitt, and Western Working &quot;families.&quot; There are also smaller subfamilies. The Brunk Family, particularly noted for soundness and athleticism, traces to the Illinois breeding program of Joseph Brunk. The Lippitt Family or &quot;Lippitts&quot; trace to the breeding program of Robert Lippitt Knight, grandson of industrialist Robert Knight and maternal great-great grandson of Revolutionary War officer Christopher Lippitt, founder of the Lippitt Mill. Robert Lippitt Knight focused on preservation breeding of horses descended from Ethan Allen II and this line is considered the &quot;purest&quot; of the four lines, with the most lines tracing back to Figure and no outcrosses to other breeds in the 20th or 21st centuries. The Government Family is the largest, tracing to Morgans bred by the US Morgan Horse Farm between 1905 and 1951. The foundation sire of this line was General Gates. When USDA involvement ended, the University of Vermont purchased not only the farm, but much of its breeding stock and carries on the program today. The Working Western Family, abbreviated 2WF, have no common breeder or ancestor, but the horses are bred to be stock horses and work cattle, some descended from Government farm stallions shipped west.
==Organizations==

In 1909, the Morgan Horse Club was founded, later changing its name to the American Morgan Horse Association. During the 1930s and 1940s, there was controversy within the registry membership as to whether the stud book should be open or closed; this mirrored similar controversies in other US breed registries. The result of these discussions was that the stud book was declared closed to outside blood as of January 1, 1948. In 1985, the US and Canadian registries signed a reciprocity agreement regarding the registration of horses, and a similar agreement was made between the US and Great Britain registries in 1990. As of 2012, approximately 179,000 horses had been registered over the life of the association, with over 3,000 new foals registered annually. It is estimated that between 175,000 and 180,000 Morgans exist worldwide, and although they are most popular in the United States, there are populations in Great Britain, Sweden and other countries.

The American Morgan Horse Association (AMHA) is the largest association for the breed. In addition to the AMHA, since 1996, there has also been a National Morgan Pony Registry, which specializes in horses under . There are several other organizations that focus on specific bloodlines within the Morgan breed. These include the Rainbow Morgan Horse Association, begun in 1990, which works with the AMHA to develop and promote unusually-colored Morgans, such as those with the silver dapple and cream genes. The Foundation Morgan Horse Association registers those horses bred to resemble the stockier type seen in the late 1800s and early 1900s, before crossbreeding with the American Saddlebred became common. Two other membership based organizations, both devoted to preserving the old-time Vermont or &quot;Lippitt&quot; strain of Morgans, also exist. The first, the Lippitt Club, was started in 1973, and the second, the Lippitt Morgan Breeders Association, was founded in 1995. The Lippitt Morgan Horse Registry, Inc., was formed in 2011. It registers and maintains a dna data base with pedigrees of Lippitt Morgans. There are also associations for Morgans in several countries besides the US, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Sweden, Austria and Germany. In Middlebury, Vermont there is a museum dedicated to the history of the breed.

==Uses==

The Morgan breed is known for its versatility, and is used for a number of English and Western events. They have been successfully shown in many disciplines, including dressage, show jumping, Western pleasure, cutting and endurance riding. They are also used as stock horses and for pleasure riding and driving. They are frequently seen in driving competitions, including combined driving and carriage driving. Morgans were the first American breed to compete in the World Pairs Driving competition, representing the US. They can be seen as mounts for 4-H and Pony Club participants and therapeutic riding programs, due to their gentle disposition and steady movement.

There are Morgan-only shows held throughout the US, as well as an &quot;open competition&quot; program run by the AMHA that gives points based on competition success at all-breed shows. The first annual Grand National and World Championship Morgan Horse Show was held in 1973 in Detroit, Michigan and in 1975 moved to its current home in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Over 1,000 horses compete in the show each year. In 1961, the Morgan horse was named the official state animal of Vermont, and in 1970, the official state horse of Massachusetts.

===In literature and film===

The children&#x27;s book, &quot;Justin Morgan Had a Horse&quot; by Marguerite Henry, published in 1945, was a fictional account of Figure and Justin Morgan. It was a Newbery Honor Book in 1946. A movie based on the book was made by Walt Disney Studios in 1972. Both the book and the movie have been criticized for containing a number of historical inaccuracies and for creating or perpetuating some myths about both Justin Morgan and Figure. One equine historian stated, &quot;these should be looked upon not as true happenings but as entertainment vehicles.&quot;

Ellen Feld, a children&#x27;s author, is also known for her &quot;Morgan Horse&quot; series. &quot;Blackjack: Dreaming of a Morgan Horse,&quot; won a Children&#x27;s Choice Award in 2005, following the 2004 award for its sequel, &quot;Frosty: The Adventures of a Morgan Horse.&quot; These awards were given by the International Reading Association and the Children’s Book Council.

A Morgan horse is the subject of the poem, &quot;The Runaway&quot; by Robert Frost. In the poem, the speaker observes &quot;A little Morgan&quot; colt who has been left out in a mountain pasture during winter and seems to be afraid of the falling snow.

<text>Rockland Community College (RCC) is a public community college in Rockland County, New York. It is part of the State University of New York. The college, established in 1959, became the 18th community college to join the SUNY system. The college offers 51 programs and offers associate degrees and certificates. Additionally, students can earn other degrees, including Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts in the arts and sciences, Doctoral Program in Executive Leadership (EdD), technology, and health professions while attending classes at Rockland through articulation programs with four-year schools. The current enrollment is 6,859 students.

The main campus is in Suffern, New York, but classes are also offered at an extension sites in Haverstraw, Nyack and Orangeburg. The Spring Valley satellite campus, sold for $4.2 million, has been discontinued. It was located in the historic North Main Street School. Instructions were discontinued at the Haverstraw Extension Center in 2020.

The college has more than 525 full and part-time faculty members, including several Fulbright Scholars, SUNY Chancellor&#x27;s Award winners, and published authors and artists. The faculty-student ratio is 22:1. Rockland has the third highest transfer rate in the SUNY system and has a Continuing Education programs which served about 3,500 each year.

==History==
An institution called Rockland College, chartered by the state Board of Regents in 1878, existed for sixteen years in Nyack, New York.

Rockland Junior College, supported by federal funds disbursed through New York State, and sponsored by Nyack High School was established in 1932 as one of several depression-era two-year schools. New York University and Syracuse University accepted two years of credit from the college. Rockland Junior College shut down in 1935.

Rockland Community College came eighteen years and later was organized to be an affordable, two-year college in location convenient for county residents; it was planned that it would raise taxes by only $4 a year. At the time, Rockland County, the state&#x27;s smallest in geographic area outside of New York City, was growing exponentially in population and in demand for a skilled, educated work force. Between 1956 and 1970, Rockland&#x27;s population was one of the fastest growing in the state, expected to double from 107,000 to 215,000 and the number of high school graduates was projected to rise from 700 to 2,463.

<doc id="645403" wikidata="Q7938230" url="?curid=645403" title="Vladimir (Waiting for Godot)">
<text>Vladimir (affectionately known as Didi; a small boy calls him Mr. Albert) is one of the two main characters from Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.

== Personality ==
The &quot;optimist&quot; (and, as Beckett put it, &quot;the major character&quot;) of &quot;Godot&quot;, he represents the intellectual side of the two main characters (in contrast to his companion Estragon&#x27;s earthy simplicity). One explanation of this intellectualism is that he was once a philosopher. This would explain his constant references and his attempts to engage Estragon in philosophical and religious debate.

Vladimir is deeply concerned with appearances and goes to great lengths to make sure Estragon behaves so that his own dignity is preserved. He is something of a pack rat: he carries all the food the tramps have (though he never eats himself), and has other (to quote the play) &quot;miscellaneous&quot; junk in various pockets. Another important prop is his bowler hat. He claims that it &quot;hurts&quot; him, and is eventually driven to appropriate Lucky&#x27;s. After long periods of thought (or whenever he is bored) he fiddles with it and plays with the brim. This hat focus (in terms of being head centred) may be interpreted as being representative of his higher status (see Estragon&#x27;s boots) and his intellectual nature: because of this, he is usually taller than Estragon, but this is a convention of the theatre and is not written in the play.

Despite this sometimes peevish and obsessive nature, Vladimir would seem to have a carnal side. He suffers from a venereal disease that causes him pain in his genitals and a need to urinate when he laughs. This might indicate a sexual past: he refers to a woman he knew who &quot;had the clap&quot;...although it is unclear whether this is the cause of his current condition or not.

Vladimir has the only social conscience in the play (compare Estragon&#x27;s misanthropic view of humanity: &quot;People are bloody ignorant apes!&quot;), and it seems that he cares a great deal for the plight of his fellow man: he expresses outrage at Pozzo&#x27;s treatment of his slave, Lucky, and acts as something of a parental figure to the sometimes childish Estragon. This is not to say Vladimir does not suffer from his own emotional tics. He hates dreams, as they represent a cruel false hope, and he is unable to cope with Estragon&#x27;s logic, the simplicity of which throws him off. He also does not suffer fools well: Pozzo&#x27;s decadence and Estragon&#x27;s crudeness give him much cause for indignation.

== The passage of time ==
Unlike all the other characters, Vladimir has a sense of the passage of time (only he says he remembers the events of Act I, although it is possible Lucky might recall them: see Lucky and Vladimir). However, he considers his memory &quot;unreliable&quot; because it can never be corroborated, due to Estragon&#x27;s memory issues. At the end of the play, it is he who realizes the futile cycle that all of them have fallen into (see second quote). However, he rejects this realization when he finds that it is almost unbearable to live with (&quot;I can&#x27;t go on!&quot;), and forces himself to dismiss it (&quot;What have I said?&quot;). He resolves to go on waiting for Godot.

== Appearance ==
Information about his appearance is decidedly scant: he walks in &quot;short stiff strides, legs wide apart,&quot; and is heavier than Estragon (which gives little information since there is no description of Estragon&#x27;s weight to use as a reference). It tends to be the convention in most productions, however, that he is tall and lanky, while Estragon is short and squat. He has been portrayed by many notable actors, including Burgess Meredith (with Zero Mostel as Estragon) and - in one rather notorious version of the play - Steve Martin (with Robin Williams as Estragon), Patrick Stewart opposite Ian McKellen, and Alex Winter (opposite Keanu Reeves).

=== Relatives ===
In Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Godot&quot; pastiche, &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, the character Guildenstern closely resembles Vladimir.

== Quotations ==
&quot;Hand in hand from the top of the Eiffel Tower, among the first. We were respectable in those days. Now it&#x27;s too late. They wouldn&#x27;t even let us up.&quot;
&quot;Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, or think I do, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon my friend, at this place, until the fall of night, I waited for Godot? That Pozzo passed, with his carrier, and that he spoke to us? Probably. But in all that what truth will there be? (&quot;Estragon, having struggled with his boots in vain, is dozing off again. Vladimir looks at him.&quot;) He&#x27;ll know nothing. He&#x27;ll tell me about the blows he received and I&#x27;ll give him a carrot.&quot;
&quot;Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say? It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come—&quot;
&quot;We wait. We are bored. No, don&#x27;t protest, we are bored to death, there&#x27;s no denying it. Good. A diversion comes along and what do we do? We let it go to waste. Come, let&#x27;s get to work! In an instant all will vanish and we&#x27;ll be alone once more, in the midst of nothingness!&quot;

<text>Allan MacInnis (born July 11, 1963) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played 23 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames (1981–1994) and St. Louis Blues (1994–2004). A first round selection of the Flames in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, he went on to become a 12-time All-Star. He was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the most valuable player of the playoffs in 1989 after leading the Flames to the Stanley Cup championship. He was voted the winner of the James Norris Memorial Trophy in 1999 as the top defenceman in the league while a member of the Blues. In 2017, MacInnis was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

MacInnis was most famous for having the hardest shot in the league. He tied Bobby Orr&#x27;s Ontario Hockey League (OHL) record for goals by a defenceman, and won two OHL championships and a Memorial Cup with the Kitchener Rangers as a junior. He famously split goaltender Mike Liut&#x27;s mask with a shot, and became only the fourth defenceman in NHL history to score 100 points in a season. Internationally, he was an all-star on defence as Canada won the 1991 Canada Cup and twice participated in the Winter Olympics. He was a member of the 2002 team that won Canada&#x27;s first gold medal in 50 years.

An eye injury suffered early in the 2003–04 NHL season forced MacInnis into retirement. He finished his career third all-time among defencemen in goals, assists and points and was named to seven postseason all-star teams. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007, and his jersey number 2 was retired by the Blues and is honoured by the Flames. MacInnis remains a member of the Blues organization, currently serving as the team&#x27;s senior advisor to the general manager. When the Blues won the Stanley Cup in 2019, he got his name engraved on the Stanley Cup for a second time.

==Early life==
MacInnis was born in Inverness, Nova Scotia, and grew up in nearby Port Hood, a fishing village on Cape Breton Island. He is the seventh of eight children born to Alex and Anna Mae MacInnis, and one of six brothers. His father worked as a coal miner and later as the assistant manager of the arena in Port Hood when the mine closed while his mother was a school teacher. The brothers all played hockey in Port Hawkesbury during the winter. MacInnis often assisted his father&#x27;s work at the arena, collecting pucks that he used to shoot repeatedly against a sheet of plywood set against the family barn during the summer. It was through this practice, which occasionally left him with blistered fingers, that he developed his powerful slapshot.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
MacInnis left home in 1979 to join the Regina Pat Blues of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). He appeared in 59 games, scoring 20 goals and 48 points with the Pat Blues, and appeared in two Western Hockey League (WHL) games with the Regina Pats. He then moved to Ontario and joined the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Following a season in which he scored 39 points in 47 games and winning the League Championship with Kitchener in the 1980–81 OHL season, MacInnis was rated as the second best defensive prospect at the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected by the Calgary Flames in the first round, 15th overall. The Flames invited him to their training camp, although they did not expect him to play for them immediately, and he was returned to junior.

Most of his season was spent with Kitchener where MacInnis was named to the OHL first All-Star team after scoring 75 points for the Rangers. The team won its second consecutive OHL title, and captured the 1982 Memorial Cup. He played a third season in Kitchener in 1982–83, and was again named a first-team All-Star after an 84-point season. Additionally, MacInnis was voted the winner of the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the OHL&#x27;s top defenceman. He tied Bobby Orr&#x27;s OHL record for goals by a defenceman in one season with 38 (subsequently broken by Bryan Fogarty&#x27;s 47 in 1988–89), and holds the Canadian Hockey League record of five goals in one game by a defenceman.

===Calgary Flames===

MacInnis made his NHL debut with the Flames on December 30, 1981, against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in two games that season, and an additional fourteen in 1982–83 in seasons spent primarily with Kitchener at the junior level. He scored his first NHL point against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 23, 1982. MacInnis began the 1983–84 season with the Colorado Flames of the Central Hockey League, scoring 19 points in 19 games before joining Calgary full-time. With the Flames, he scored 11 goals and 34 assists in 51 games and appeared in his first 11 postseason games during the 1984 Stanley Cup playoffs.

A point-per-game pace in 1984–85 (66 points in 67 games) earned MacInnis his first All-Star Game appearance, playing in front of his hometown fans at the 1985 game in Calgary. He was voted a second-team All-Star for the 1986–87 NHL season, and started his first All-Star Game in 1988. He was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman in the league in three consecutive seasons, 1989, 1990 and 1991, but failed to win the award each time.

Led by MacInnis&#x27; 31 points, the Flames won the first Stanley Cup championship in their history in 1989. He had four goals and five assists in six games in the final series against the Montreal Canadiens en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs. MacInnis became the first defenceman to lead the league in postseason scoring, and he finished with a 17-game scoring streak, the longest by a defenceman in NHL history.

MacInnis finished second amongst NHL defencemen in scoring in 1989–90 with 90 points and was named a First Team All-Star for the first time. He improved to a career high 103 points the following year, becoming the first Flames&#x27; defenceman and only the fourth in NHL history to record a 100-point season. He scored his 563rd career point in a January 8, 1991, game against Toronto, to surpass Kent Nilsson as the franchise&#x27;s all-time scoring leader. MacInnis missed three months of the 1992–93 season when he suffered a dislocated hip during a game on November 11, 1992, against the Hartford Whalers. While chasing a puck at high speed, he lost control and crashed into the end boards after Hartford rookie Patrick Poulin shoved MacInnis with his stick. Three weeks after his return to action, on February 23, 1993, MacInnis set a Flames franchise record when he appeared in his 706th career game.

Following five consecutive seasons where the Flames failed to advance past the first round of the playoffs, both MacInnis and the team were looking for a change in the summer of 1994. Though the Flames made an offer of C$2.5 million per season for MacInnis, he instead signed an offer sheet with the St. Louis Blues for US$3.5 million a season for four years, making him the fourth highest-paid player in the NHL. As MacInnis was a restricted free agent, the Blues sent defenceman Phil Housley and two second round draft picks to the Flames in compensation while also receiving a fourth round selection back.

MacInnis said his decision to leave Calgary was not easy to make given his family was from the city. He claimed money was not the only reason he signed with the Blues, stating that he wanted a new challenge. He left Calgary after 11 full NHL seasons as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in scoring with 822 points, and led in assists (603), games played (803), playoff assists (77) and playoff points (103). He appeared in six All-Star Games with Calgary and was named a league all-star five times: twice on the first team and three times on the second. The team honoured MacInnis as the first player inducted into their &quot;Forever a Flame&quot; program in 2012. His jersey number 2 was raised to the Saddledome rafters on February 27, 2012, but was not formally retired.

===St. Louis Blues===
Pneumonia and a late-season shoulder injury limited MacInnis to 28 points in 32 games in 1994–95, a season itself reduced to 48 games by a labour dispute. While he returned to play in the postseason, MacInnis required off-season surgery to repair the damage to his shoulder. He returned to health in 1995–96, appearing in all 82 games for the Blues. Early in his third season with the Blues, MacInnis played his 1,000th game in an October 23, 1997, match-up against the Vancouver Canucks. However he again suffered a separation of his surgically repaired shoulder in December 1997, an injury that forced him out of the Blues line-up for three weeks.

MacInnis scored a goal and an assist in a 5–3 loss to the Detroit Red Wings on April 7, 1998, to become just the sixth defenceman in NHL history to score 1,000 points. After coming close several times, MacInnis finally won the Norris Trophy as the league&#x27;s top defenceman in 1998–99. Early in the 2000–01 season, MacInnis recorded four assists in a 5–2 victory over the Florida Panthers to set a Blues franchise record for scoring by a defenceman. He reached the mark with his 300th point, scored in his 424th game with the organization.

When Chris Pronger broke his arm early in the 2002–03 NHL season, MacInnis was named interim captain for the remainder of the season. He completed the season as the league&#x27;s leader in scoring amongst defencemen with 68 points. Pronger insisted that MacInnis remain captain permanently when he returned for the 2003–04 season. MacInnis played only three games that season as vision problems he suffered during an October 2003 game against the Nashville Predators were diagnosed as being the result of a detached retina in one eye – the same eye in which he suffered a serious injury after being struck by a high stick in 2001. He missed the remainder of the season as a result, and after the 2004–05 NHL season was cancelled due to a labour dispute, MacInnis felt that he could not return to the game at a high enough level to compete.

MacInnis announced his retirement as a player on September 9, 2005, but remained with the Blues organization as part of its marketing and hockey operations departments. Ending his career with 1,274 points, MacInnis ranked third all-time in goals, assists and points amongst defencemen, and played in six additional All-Star Games as a member of the Blues. The team retired his jersey number 2 on April 9, 2006, and honoured him with a bronze statue out front of the Scottrade Center in 2009. MacInnis was inducted to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007. He was the first player from Nova Scotia so honoured, and was also inducted into the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame and the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame.

===International===
MacInnis was a member of the Canadian national team on four occasions. He first represented Canada at the 1990 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships where he scored one goal and four points. One year later, he played in his only Canada Cup tournament. He scored two goals and four assists and was named a tournament all-star as Canada won the title over the United States. He suffered a separated shoulder shortly before the 1998 Winter Olympics, and while it was feared he would be unavailable for the tournament as a result, recovered in time to be cleared to play. MacInnis scored two goals during the tournament, but Canada finished in fourth place after losing the bronze medal match to Finland following a semi-final loss to the Czech Republic. MacInnis also participated in the 2002 Winter Olympics. Though he scored no points in the tournament, Canada defeated the United States to win the nation&#x27;s first gold medal in hockey in 50 years.

==Playing style==

MacInnis was best known for the power and accuracy of his slapshot. The Flames selected him in the 1981 Draft on the strength of his shot alone; his skating ability was so poor when he arrived for his first training camp in Calgary he earned the nickname &quot;Chopper&quot;. While some reporters expected he would be a bust as a result, MacInnis said the patience the Flames showed him in his early days as a professional allowed him to develop into a more complete defenceman.

The power of his shot grew into legend on January 17, 1984, in a game against St. Louis. In his first full season with the Flames, MacInnis took a slapshot from just outside the Blues&#x27; defensive zone that struck goaltender Mike Liut on the mask. The shot split Liut&#x27;s helmet while the puck fell into the net for a goal. The power of his shot, and the fear it inspired in his opposition, led to MacInnis&#x27; success as an offensive-defenceman, especially as a threat on the power play. MacInnis resisted the transition to carbon-fiber sticks in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The new stick technology offering better flexing characteristics and increased shot speed, but MacInnis preferred the feel of traditional wooden sticks. He continued to win &quot;Hardest Shot&quot; events at All-Star Game skills competitions despite competing with the technologically inferior wooden sticks. He won the event a total of seven times between 1991 and 2003. He occasionally topped , including his win in the 2000 All-Star Game.

Used primarily as a power play specialist in his first years as a professional, MacInnis worked at improving his overall game such that he was named a Norris Trophy finalist three consecutive seasons between 1989 and 1991, and was the runner-up to Ray Bourque in 1991. He finally won the Norris Trophy as the league&#x27;s top defenceman in 1999 with the Blues. Former teammate Doug Gilmour praised MacInnis&#x27; passing ability. MacInnis&#x27;s play developed to the point where he was as valued for his defensive ability on the penalty kill as he was his offence on the power play.

==Off the ice==
MacInnis married his wife Jackie shortly after winning the Stanley Cup in 1989, and the couple have four children, Carson, Ryan, Lauren and Riley. MacInnis settled in St. Louis following his retirement, and in 2006 was named the Blues&#x27; Vice-President of Hockey Operations. He coaches his children&#x27;s minor hockey teams, and in 2008–09 coached the St. Louis Junior AAA Blues to a 73–3–2 record and the championship title at the 50th Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament. His son Ryan was a member of the Kitchener Rangers, and was drafted by the Arizona Coyotes in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. His daughter Lauren has committed to play ice hockey at Northeastern University.

Though his career took him away from Nova Scotia, MacInnis remains involved with his hometown. In 2001, he committed C$100,000 towards a major renovation of the Port Hood Arena. The arena was renamed the Al MacInnis Sports Centre in his honour, and he hosts an annual golf tournament to help raise funds for the arena commission. On the day he was inducted into the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame, he donated $100,000 to the Inverness County Memorial Hospital in the memory of his parents.

In 2018, he finished third to hockey superstar Sidney Crosby and curler Colleen Jones in a listing of the greatest 15 athletes in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history.

<text>Richard Marvin Hansen (born August 26, 1957) is a Canadian track and field athlete (Paralympic Games and Olympic Games), activist, and philanthropist for people with disabilities. When Rick was 15, he was riding in the back of a pickup truck after a fishing trip with his friend, when the driver lost control and the vehicle rolled over. Hansen was trapped on the inside of the roll and thrown to the ground, along with the equipment from the truck. As a result of the crash, Hansen broke his back, sustained a spinal cord injury and became paralyzed from the waist down.

Hansen is most famous for his Man In Motion World Tour, in which he circled the globe in a wheelchair to demonstrate the potential of people with disabilities if barriers were removed and to raise money to support the removal of additional barriers in the future for people with disabilities in the future. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. He was one of the final torchbearers in the 1988 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Olympics. He was profiled and spoke during the 2010 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony. &quot;CTV News Special: Rick Hansen: Unbreakable 50 Years Later&quot;  aired on Dec 2, 2023 featuring interviews with Hansen and Sandie Rinaldo, along with exclusive footage of Hansen returning to the site of the accident in Williams Lake for the first time. The event marked 50 years since he sustained his spinal cord injury.

==Early life==
Born in Port Alberni, British Columbia in 1957, Rick Hansen grew up in Williams Lake, British Columbia. He had an active childhood, where he played volleyball, baseball, softball, and basketball. He often spent time outdoors with his father and grandfather who took him fishing.

On June 27, 1973, Rick and a friend were coming back from a fishing trip and riding in the back of a pickup truck when the driver lost control of the vehicle and rolled. The impact threw Rick and his friend from the vehicle, resulting in breaking his back a spinal injury that left Rick paralyzed from the waist down.

He worked on rehabilitation, completed high school, and in 1976 he enrolled at the University of British Columbia, and became the first student with a physical disability to graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physical education in 1986 from the university. Hansen won national championships on wheelchair volleyball and wheelchair basketball teams. In 1977, Hansen recruited Terry Fox to join the Vancouver Cable Cars to play on their wheelchair basketball team. The two became good friends.

Hansen went on to become a world class champion wheelchair marathoner and Paralympic athlete. He competed in wheelchair racing, winning a total of six medals; three gold, two silver, and one bronze. Hansen won 19 international wheelchair marathons, including three world championships. He also coached high school basketball and volleyball. Rick had a very close relationship with his family, especially with his brother, father and grandfather, with whom he enjoyed frequent fishing trips.

==Man in Motion World Tour==

In 1980, fellow British Columbian and Canadian athlete Terry Fox, who had lost a leg to bone cancer, undertook the Marathon of Hope, intending to run across Canada from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island to raise awareness for cancer research. He made it from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to Thunder Bay, Ontario before a cancer recurrence forced him to stop, about halfway through his journey. Inspired by the way Canadians decided to reframe disability by Terry&#x27;s demonstration of ability,  Hansen decided he also wanted to make a difference by applying his athletic talent on his Man In Motion World Tour to demonstrate the potential of people with disabilities if barriers were removed and to inspire a more accessible world.
He embarked on his Man In Motion World Tour on March 21, 1985, from Oakridge Mall in Vancouver. Although public attention was low at the beginning of the Tour, he soon attracted international media attention as he progressed on a 26-month trek, logging 40,075 km through 34 countries on four continents (North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia) before crossing Canada. One of the highlights of the Tour was wheeling up the Great Wall of China. His highest summit was in the Swiss Alps at 5,577 ft (1700 metres). Each wheeling day, he averaged 12 to 14 hours of wheeling and 85 km a day. He returned to Vancouver&#x27;s BC Place Stadium to cheering crowds of  fifty thousand well-wishers on May 22, 1987. Hansen and his team raised $26 million for the removal of barriers for people with disabilities. The Tour also helped to change the way people with disabilities are perceived.

On May 22, 2017, Rick Hansen donated one of his well-used gloves from the Tour to the Canadian Museum of History. The glove is on display in the Museum&#x27;s signature exhibition, the Canadian History Hall, alongside an image from Hansen&#x27;s Man In Motion World Tour visit to the Great Wall of China in April 1986.

On May 17, 2020, the Canadian Museum of History announced the acquisition of the Rick Hansen Man In Motion World Tour Collection. Spanning Hansen&#x27;s early athletic career and life on Tour, the collection includes 1,700 artifacts and thousands of behind-the-scenes videos, photographs and documents. The collection was donated by Rick Hansen. The Rick Hansen Gallery located in the BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum features a small selection of memorabilia from Hansen&#x27;s Tour including one of his wheelchairs, competitive wheelchair marathon medals and video footage.

The song &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; was inspired by Rick Hansen&#x27;s Man In Motion World Tour, and written by Canadian record producer and composer David Foster and British musician John Parr, and performed by Parr for the soundtrack of the film &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. It reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States in September 1985.

==Post-tour career==
Hansen is the founder of the Rick Hansen Foundation, which has generated more than $394 million to heighten awareness, change attitudes and advance the quality of life for people with disabilities.

===Rick Hansen Foundation===
The Rick Hansen Foundation was established in 1988, as a legacy to Rick Hansen&#x27;s Man In Motion World Tour to continue raising funds and awareness to create a world without barriers for people with disabilities. For over 35 years, the Foundation has been actively improving the lives of people with disabilities, changing perceptions and breaking down barriers. The vision of the organization is to create an inclusive world where people with disabilities are living to their full potential. Through programs, collaboration and leadership, the Foundation continues to remove both physical and attitudinal barriers, and improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, which include the cure and care of people living with spinal cord injuries (SCI).

The Foundation operates two major programs. The Rick Hansen Foundation School Program educates and empowers youth from Kindergarten to Grade 12 to become accessibility and inclusion champions. The Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification (RHFAC) program provides a range of accessibility training courses, and rates and certifies sites on their level of meaningful accessibility for people of varying abilities.  

Every year, starting on the last Sunday in May, Canadians celebrate National AccessAbility Week (NAAW).  Founded as “National Access Awareness Week&quot; in 1988, and inspired by Hansen&#x27;s Man In Motion World Tour, this week is an opportunity to celebrate Canadians with disabilities and raise awareness of the critical need for accessibility and inclusion in communities and workplaces. During 2011 and 2012, the Foundation was also part of a cross-Canada tour called the Rick Hansen 25th Anniversary Relay that followed the same route as Hansen&#x27;s original Man In Motion Tour, roughly 25 years after it began.

=== Spinal cord injury research ===
Hansen was noted as &quot;the driving force&quot; in the development of the 48 million dollars raised for the International Collaboration of Repair Discoveries (ICORD), an interdisciplinary research centre focused on spinal cord injury. ICORD also maintains the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry, allowing doctors and experts across the country to share vital information on what works and what doesn&#x27;t for specific kinds of spinal cord injuries.

ICORD is located inside the Blusson Spinal Cord Centre, which is also home to the Brenda and David McLean Integrated Spine Clinic, which provides one-stop outpatient care for people with spinal cord injuries or diseases of the spine, as well as the Praxis Spinal Cord Institute (formerly the Rick Hansen Institute).

The building integrates both SCI research with care.

=== Other initiatives ===
Hansen is a supporter of the conservation of Fraser River White sturgeon and Pacific Salmon.  He has served as chair for the Founding Chair of both Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society (FRSCS) and the Pacific Salmon Endowment Fund Society, helping to restore and protect sturgeon and salmon populations in British Columbia. Hansen contributed to the Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society with the money earned from the book &quot;Tale of the Great White Fish&quot;. He continues to support the FRSCS and the Pacific Salmon Foundation.

<text>Cayuga Community College, formerly Cayuga County Community College, is a public community college in Cayuga County, New York, United States. It is part of the SUNY system and began in 1953 as Auburn Community College. Its main campus is in Auburn, New York. The college also serves Oswego County with its branch campus in Fulton.

The college offers associate degrees and now hosts the University Center, which offers B.A. and B.S. degrees from a number of colleges, on the grounds of CCC. There are 3,775 full-time and part-time students. Degree programs include liberal arts for transfer preparation, computer science, criminal justice, broadcasting, art, nursing, geographic information systems, and education.

==History==
The State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees approved the establishment of its first community college on April 9, 1953. Classes began the following year in September at Auburn Community College in the former James Street Elementary School with sixty-nine students. In 1977, Cayuga County assumed sponsorship for the college and it changed its name to Cayuga County Community College. Albert T. Skinner, dean from 1953 to 1955 and president from 1955 until 1978 was instrumental in starting and developing the school from its humble beginnings to the campus where it is now located. Four of its buildings were added during his tenure.

Six year after opening, the college moved to its current location to accommodate rising enrollment. The original classroom building remains the main building on campus with other buildings added at later dates: the library (1964), the technology building (1970), the bookstore (1971), Spartan Hall (1980), and the nature center (1983). Later expansions included the opening of the Fulton Campus in 1994. In 2003, the college also opened the Regional Economic Center which housed classrooms for Cayuga students, the offices of several agencies providing employment services to area residents, the new home of the college&#x27;s NASA-sponsored Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technology, and the college’s Business and Industry Center, a workforce training complex.

Daniel Paul Larson joined Cayuga as its seventh president in 2007. Six years into his term, in 2013, the college experienced public turmoil when three of the four unions at the college voted no confidence in his leadership. In October of that year, he tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the board effective November 4. Shortly thereafter, the college also declared financial exigency.

Gregory T. DeCinque joined Cayuga Community College as Interim President in December 2013. Brian M. Durant succeeded him in August 2015.

==Campus==

===Auburn===

Cayuga Community College is in the Cayuga-Oswego County region. Cayuga consists of a main campus in Auburn, and a second in Fulton. The Auburn Campus has a main structure that consists of 5 main sections referred to as &quot;buildings&quot;. Those sections of the campus when facing the campus are from right to left: Spartan Hall, the Main Building, the Regional Economic Center, the Library Building, and the Tech Building.

Cayuga Community College degree programs include health sciences such as Occupational Therapy Assistant programs, media production, art, accounting, education, criminal justice, geographic information systems, and liberal arts.

===Fulton===
Located in Fulton New York in Oswego county, Cayuga opened an extension site in the city of Fulton in January 1994. The &quot;campus&quot; briefly consisted of two rented classrooms in the basement of the Fulton Education Center, until later in the year when classes and offices moved into the former Holy Family School building on West Third Street.

In the summer of 2001 the facility on Route 3 opened as Cayuga&#x27;s Fulton Extension Center. It was expanded in 2004 with additional classroom and office space to meet a dramatic rise in enrollment. In 2006, New York State granted the facility branch campus status, and the &quot;Fulton campus&quot; designation became official.

On July 20, 2011 it was reported in the Syracuse Post Standard that Architectural plans are moving forward for a new Fulton campus. The college’s Board of Trustees looked over floor plans of the new Fulton campus to be built in the River Glen shopping center. Architect Karin Kilgore-Green said of space in the former P&amp;C store in Fulton will be converted. A second floor with of space will be built over P&amp;C site. The college bought the former P&amp;C Foods building at River Glen Plaza for $950,000 and also is paying $495,000 for of adjoining land. College officials said the purchases were made because CCC needed more space and wanted to own its site.

The current facility on Route 481 opened in the summer of 2012 as Cayuga&#x27;s Fulton campus. At the heart of the campus is the Learning Commons, housing an open computing lab with dozens of computer workstations, a Center for Academic Success, and the Disabilities Services offices. Also located within the Learning Commons is the library, providing continually expanding collections of print and nonprint resources for Fulton faculty and staff, instruction service, laptop computers, online access to all electronic resources, and daily delivery of items from the Auburn collections.

The Fulton campus also features 21 general classrooms, distance-learning and video conferencing facilities, five dedicated computer labs, two rooms that could be computer and classrooms, two art rooms, two science labs for biology and chemistry, two conference rooms with the capability for distance learning, library, health suite, offices and student support area with financial aid, bursar and admissions. The Fulton campus also houses business and industry training facilities, a full-service bookstore, and a student lounge.

==Governance==
The college is governed by a ten-member Board of Trustees. The Governor appoints four trustees for seven-year terms, five are appointed by the Cayuga County Legislature for seven-year terms, and a student trustee is elected annually and serves for one year. Dr. Gregory T. DeCinque became Cayuga&#x27;s interim president in 2013.

==Publications==
The &quot;Cayuga Collegian&quot; is the school&#x27;s official student newspaper. It was first published on October 31, 1953 at Auburn Community College as the &quot;Auburn Collegian.&quot; The name was changed to the &quot;Cayuga Collegian&quot; when Cayuga County began to sponsor the college, which was then renamed Cayuga County Community College in 1975.

The creative writing and art clubs publish the creative arts journal &quot;Listen&quot;. The Auburn/Cayuga Community College Alumni Association publishes the ACC/CCC alumni newsletter every semester.

<doc id="645446" wikidata="Q7782377" url="?curid=645446" title="Theoreticism">
<text>In philosophy and particularly political philosophy, theoreticism is the preference for theory over practice (or, more broadly, abstract knowledge over concrete action), or a philosophical position which would lead to such a preference.

The term is often used pejoratively. In Marxist philosophy, for instance, theoreticism is often identified as a political error, valorizing the efforts of academic Marxism over those of revolutionary struggle. Louis Althusser, for instance, criticized his own early work for theoreticism. In phenomenology, theoreticism would be something closer to the over-valuing of knowledge at the cost of losing a proper appreciation of experience. Martin Heidegger claimed this trend was begun by Plato, and that it continued in an &quot;intensification and hardening of &#x27;theoreticism&#x27;, the drive toward technical and objectifying modes of knowledge and, with it, the oblivion of any more primordial or more reverential kind of existence.&quot;

<doc id="645447" wikidata="Q634145" url="?curid=645447" title="Archigram">
<text>Archigram was an avant-garde British architectural group whose unbuilt projects and media-savvy provocations &quot;spawned the most influential architectural movement of the 1960&#x27;s,&quot; according to Princeton Architectural Press study &quot;Archigram&quot; (1999). Neofuturistic, anti-heroic, and pro-consumerist, the group drew inspiration from technology in order to create a new reality that was expressed through hypothetical projects, i.e., its buildings were never built, although the group did produce what the architectural historian Charles Jencks called &quot;a series of monumental objects (one hesitates in calling them buildings since most of them moved, grew, flew, walked, burrowed or just sank under the water.&quot; The works of Archigram had a neofuturistic slant, influenced by Antonio Sant&#x27;Elia&#x27;s works. Buckminster Fuller and Yona Friedman were also important sources of inspiration.

&quot;Their attitude was closely tied to the technocratic ideology of the American designer Buckminster Fuller,&quot; Kenneth Frampton confirms, in &quot;Modern Architecture: A Critical History&quot;, &quot;and to that of his British apologists John McHale and Reyner Banham. ... Archigram&#x27;s subsequent commitment to a &#x27;high-tech,&#x27; lightweight, infrastructural approach (the kind of indeterminacy implicit in the work of Fuller and even more evident in Yona Friedman&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Architecture mobile&quot; of 1958) brought them, rather paradoxically, to indulge in ironic forms of science fiction, rather than to project solutions that were either truly indeterminate or capable of being realized and appropriated by society.&quot;

==History==

===Origins: 1960-61===

Based at the Architectural Association in London, the main members of the group were Peter Cook, Warren Chalk, Ron Herron, Dennis Crompton, Michael Webb and David Greene. Archigram formed in late in the year 1960, shortly before the first issue of their magazine of the same name, which appeared in 1961. Designer Theo Crosby was the &quot;hidden hand&quot; behind the group. He gave them coverage in &quot;Architectural Design&quot; magazine (where he was an editor from 1953 to 1962), brought them to the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, where, in 1963, they mounted an exhibition called &quot;Living City&quot;, and in 1964 brought them into the Taylor Woodrow Design Group, which he headed, to take on experimental projects. The pamphlet &quot;Archigram I&quot; was printed in 1961 to proclaim their ideas. The group experimented with modular technology, mobility through the environment, space capsules, and consumer-culture imagery. Their projects offered a seductive vision of a glamorous, high-tech future. Social and environmental issues were, however, left largely unaddressed.

The group tapped into the zeitgeist captured by Richard Hamilton in his &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; exhibition in 1956 at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, by Pop Art, by the turned-on, tuned-in psychedelic counterculture, and by the gnomic pronouncements of the media theorist Marshall McLuhan. Then, too, some of its guiding principles were premonitory of what the politically radical French avant-garde would later call Situationism. In the Living City exhibition, Archigram &quot;collected images from any part of the city—the accepted Pop iconography of spaceman, superman, robotman, and woman—but presented them in a way and with a message that was new to architecture,&quot; Jencks writes, in &quot;Modern Movements in Architecture&quot;.

The city was seen not as architecture (hardware), but as people and their &quot;situations&quot; (software). It was these infinitely variable and fleeting situations which gave the real life to the city: in this sense &quot;the home, the whole city, and the frozen pea pack are all the same.&quot; Not only are they all expendable, but they are all products which interact with man in the same level, &quot;the situation&quot;.
Archigram agitated to prevent modernism from becoming a sterile orthodoxy, rendered safe by its adherents. Contrary to Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s notion of &quot;ephemeralization,&quot; which assumes more must be done with less and less (because material resources are finite), Archigram presumes a future of inexhaustible resources.

===Mid-&#x27;60s===

According to Jencks, Archigram&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary inventiveness&quot; and delirious, Pop sci-fi imagery attracted international media attention throughout 1963–65. The group designed cities &quot;that looked like computers and molehills, that crawled on the shoots of a telescope like Eduardo Paolozzi&#x27;s Bug-Eyed Monsters, that bobbed under the sea like so many skewered balloons, that sprouted—swock!—out of the sea like a Tom Wolfian, hydraulic umbrella, that zoomed down from the clouds flashing &#x27;Destroy-Man! Kill-All-Humans,&#x27; a space-comic-robot-zaap, that clicked into place along pneumatic tubes, a plug-in plastic layer cake, that gurgled and spluttered over the old city like creeping, cancerous, testubular, friendly Daleks.&quot;

&quot;The strength of Archigram&#x27;s appeal,&quot; wrote the architecture critic and historian Reyner Banham, &quot;stems from many things, including youthful enthusiasm in a field (city planning) which is increasingly the preserve of middle-aged caution. But chiefly it offers an image-starved world a new vision of the city of the future, a city of components on racks, components in stacks, components plugged into networks and grids, a city of components being swung into place by cranes.&quot;

===Late &#x27;60s===

By 1967, in works like &quot;Control and Choice Living&quot; (1967), the group had turned its attention to the question of exploiting, in architecture and urban planning, those &quot;systems, organizations, and techniques that permit the emancipation and general good life of the individual&quot; within &quot;a high-density location,&quot; writes Jencks. &quot;The solution was a minimal set of fixed elements which increased in flexibility from the permanent pylons to the completely flexible &#x27;air-habs.&#x27; The latter invention was a combination un-house and blow-up satellite (that is, an air-inflatable satellite)&quot; of seemingly infinite possibility. The inhabitant &quot;could dial out a room or if this were not desired drive the electric car into it and sprout out a room within a room. In effect, the services robot is now decentralized to include every part of the house.&quot;

===1970&#x27;s===

By the early 1970s, the group had changed its strategy. In 1973, wrote Theo Crosby, its members had &quot;found their original impulses towards megastructures blunted by the changing intellectual climate in England, where the brash dreams of modern architects are received with ever-increasing horror. They are now more concerned with the infiltration of technology into the environment at a much less obvious level.&quot;

The group was supported by mainstream architects, such as David Rock of BDP. Rock later nominated Archigram for the RIBA Royal Gold Medal, which they received in 2002.

==Projects==
===Plug-in City, Peter Cook, 1966===

Plug-in City is a mega-structure with no buildings, just a massive framework into which dwellings in the form of cells or standardised components could be slotted. The machine had taken over and people were the raw material being processed, the difference being that people are meant to enjoy the experience.

===The Walking City, Ron Herron, 1964===

The Walking City is constituted by intelligent buildings or robots in the form of giant, self-contained living pods designed to roam freely. The form derived from a combination of insect and machine and was a literal interpretation of Le Corbusier&#x27;s aphorism that a house was a &quot;machine for living in.&quot; The pods were intended to be independent yet parasitic, since they could &quot;plug into&quot; way stations to exchange occupants or replenish resources. The imagined context for these ambulatory, high-tech structures was a post-apocalyptic future in which the urban landscape lay in ruins, devastated by a man-made catastrophe.

Archigram was interested &quot;in the Armageddon overtones of survival technology,&quot; Frampton claims. &quot;For all their surface irony, [Herron&#x27;s &quot;Walking Cities&quot;] were clearly projected as stalking across a ruined world in the aftermath of a nuclear war. ... [T]hey suggest some sort of nightmarish salvation, rescuing both men and artifacts after a cataclysmic disaster.&quot;

===Instant City, Peter Cook, 1968-70===

Instant City is a mobile technological event that drifts into underdeveloped, drab towns via air (balloons) with provisional structures (performance spaces) in tow. The effect is a deliberate overstimulation to produce mass culture, with an embrace of advertising aesthetics. The whole endeavor is intended to eventually move on, leaving behind advanced technology hook-ups.

===Other projects===

Tuned City, in which Archigram&#x27;s infrastructural and spatial additions attach themselves to an existing town at a percentage that leaves evidence of the previous development, rather than subsuming the whole.

The French fashion line Sixpack France dedicated their Summer Spring 2009 Collection to this movement.

== Influence and legacy ==

The group&#x27;s paper architecture (i.e., visionary architecture) served as a source of inspiration for early works by Norman Foster, Gianfranco Franchini, and Future Systems and, most memorably, the Pompidou centre (commissioned 1971, opened 1977) by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, an arresting example of High tech, a.k.a. structural expressionism. &quot;The building is obviously a realization of the technological and infrastructural rhetoric of Archigram,&quot; writes Frampton, &quot;and while the full consequences of this approach are becoming evident through everyday use, it is apparent that certain paradoxical achievements may be claimed on its behalf.&quot;

In the first place, it is an outstanding popular success—as much for its sensational nature as anything else. In the second, it is a brilliant &quot;tour de force&quot; in advanced technique, looking for all the world like an oil refinery whose technology it attempts to emulate.

Frampton concedes, however, that the Pompidou seems &quot;to have come into being with the minimum regard for the specificity of its brief—for the art and library holdings it was destined to house. It represents the design approach of indeterminacy and optimum flexibility taken to extremes.&quot;

In Jencks&#x27;s estimation, &quot;the great contribution of the British avant-garde&quot;—of which Archigram is perhaps the most exuberantly iconoclastic exponent, in architecture—&quot;has been to open up and develop new attitudes towards living in an advanced industrial civilization where only stereotyped rejection had existed before, to dramatizing consumer choice and communicating the pleasure inherent in manipulating sophisticated technology. If these strategies will not solve the deeper social and political urban problems, at least they open up new alternative routes for thinking about consumer society and urbanism.&quot;

There were detractors. &quot;By 1972, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown could no longer take Archigram seriously,&quot; writes Simon Sadler, in &quot;Archigram: Architecture without Architecture&quot;. He quotes their landmark critique of postmodern architecture, &quot;Learning from Las Vegas&quot;, published that year: “Archigram’s structural visions are Jules Verne versions of the Industrial Revolution with an appliqué of Pop-aerospace terminology.”

And defenders: &quot;Three years later,&quot; writes Sadler, the architecture critic Martin Pawley argued that Archigram &quot;stood for &#x27;an existential technology for individuals that the world will, in time, come to regard with the same awe as is presently accorded to the prescience of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, or the Marquis de Sade. Futile to complain (as many do),‘But they never build anything.’ Verne never built the Nautilus, Wells could hardly drive a car, and the Marquis de Sade?”

In 2019, the M+ museum in Hong Kong acquired Archigram&#x27;s entire archive, despite purported attempts to block the sale to an overseas buyer.

<doc id="645449" wikidata="Q5039350" url="?curid=645449" title="Caribbean Basin Trade and Partnership Act">
<text>The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) is a law adopted by the U.S. Government in October 2000 to delineate enhanced trade preferences and eligibility requirements for the 24 beneficiary countries of the Caribbean Basin region.

On October 2, President Clinton signed the Proclamation implementing the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA – Title II of the Trade and Development Act of 2000). The Presidential Proclamation declares the 24 current beneficiary countries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to be &quot;Beneficiary Countries&quot; for purposes of the enhanced trade preferences made available under the CBTPA. In addition, the Proclamation modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to reflect the new trade preferences. It also delegates to the Office of the United States Trade Representative the authority to publish (through a Federal Register notice) additional determinations regarding the compliance of CBTPA Beneficiary Countries with customs-related procedures established in the CBTPA.

==Summary of Enhanced CBTPA Preferences==

The CBTPA significantly expands preferential treatment for apparel made in the Caribbean Basin region. Duty- and quota-free treatment is provided for apparel made in the CBI from U.S. fabrics formed from U.S. yarns. Duty/quota-free treatment is also available for certain knit apparel made in CBTPA beneficiary countries from fabrics formed in the Caribbean Basin region, provided that U.S. yarns are used in forming the fabric. This &quot;regional fabric&quot; benefit for knit apparel is subject to an overall yearly limit, with a separate limit provided for T-shirts.

New duty/quota free treatment will also be available for apparel made in the CBI from fabrics determined to be in &quot;short supply&quot; in the United States, and for designated &quot;hand-loomed, handmade, or folklore&quot; articles.

In addition to these apparel preferences, the CBTPA provides NAFTA-equivalent tariff treatment for certain items previously excluded from duty-free treatment under the CBI program (e.g., footwear, canned tuna, petroleum products, watches and watch parts).

==Beneficiary Country Designation==

The CBTPA authorized the President to designate individual countries as being &quot;Beneficiary Countries&quot; in order to receive the enhanced trade benefits available under the Act. The twenty-four current beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) were potentially eligible to be declared CBTPA Beneficiary Countries. These countries are: Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and British Virgin Islands. Through the Proclamation issued today, President Clinton designated all 24 countries as CBTPA Beneficiary Countries.

==Eligibility Review Factors==

In considering the eligibility of these countries for CBTPA Beneficiary Country status, the CBTPA required the President to take into account the existing eligibility criteria of the CBERA, as well as several new criteria elaborated in the CBTPA. These new criteria include:

# Whether the beneficiary country has demonstrated a commitment to undertake its obligations under the WTO on or ahead of schedule and participate in negotiations toward the completion of the FTAA or another free trade agreement.
# The extent to which the country provides protection of intellectual property rights consistent with or greater than the protection afforded under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.
# The extent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker&#x27;s rights, including:
## the right of association;
## the right to organize and bargain collectively;
## a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor;
## a minimum age for the employment of children; and
## acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health;
# Whether the country has implemented its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.
# The extent to which the country has met U.S. counter-narcotics certification criteria under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.
# The extent to which the country has taken steps to become a party to and implements the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption.
# The extent to which the country applied transparent, nondiscriminatory and competitive procedures in government procurement, and contribute to efforts in international for to develop an implement rules on transparency in government procurement.

==Customs-Related Eligibility Determination==

In addition to Presidential eligibility designations based on the criteria described above, the CBTPA requires an additional determination that countries have implemented or are making substantial progress towards implementing certain customs procedures based on those contained in the NAFTA. Today&#x27;s Proclamation delegates authority for these additional determinations to USTR. USTR will publish initial determinations on this eligibility criteria in coming days, through a notice in the Federal Register.

==Eligibility Review Process==

The USTR-chaired Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) conducted a review of countries&#x27; eligibility for CBTPA preferences, taking into account the criteria established in the Act. This review relied upon information provided by U.S. Embassies, keyed to the various eligibility criteria, as well as on information from other reliable sources, such as the International Labour Organization. In addition, the TPSC took into account public comments regarding the eligibility review, solicited through a Federal Register notice published June 19, 2000. The TPSC received 206 comments in response to this notice.

Through a series of meetings, the TPSC identified a number of concerns regarding certain countries&#x27; performance with respect to the eligibility criteria established in the CBTPA. For each of these areas of concern, the TPSC further identified specific policy objectives to be pursued with the relevant governments, with the general aim of soliciting assurances that these concerns would be addressed. For those countries for which concerns and objectives had been identified, U.S. Embassy officials in the Caribbean Basin region and other U.S. government officials conducted intensive advocacy with local government officials. TPSC recommendations to the President regarding the designation of CBTPA Beneficiary Countries were based on the results
of these efforts.

The eligibility review process involved direct, issue-specific advocacy with a majority of the countries that were potentially eligible for CBTPA benefits. Objectives with respect to intellectual property protection, worker rights, implementation of WTO agreements, and commitments to abide by international anti-corruption guidelines were pursued with a range of countries. The review concluded that CBI countries satisfied the CBTPA criteria regarding commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor; however, several countries were urged to expand upon their current efforts to combat all forms of child labor.

==Guatemala: Additional Review of Worker Rights Issues==

The review of Guatemala&#x27;s eligibility for the enhanced CBI preferences involved extensive consideration of the worker rights situation in that country. The United States raised specific concerns with respect to anti-union violence, including a 1999 incident in which armed vigilantes threatened and kidnapped leaders of a banana workers&#x27; union who were protesting the illegal dismissal of 900 workers. Guatemala was asked to facilitate negotiations to reemploy the 900 fired workers and to commit to speedy and effective implementation of labor code requirements with respect to this case. Guatemala&#x27;s government was also asked to work with the country&#x27;s legislature to pass proposed revisions to the labor code, and to provide a commitment, over the longer-term, to continual improvements in law enforcement and judicial administration related to the protection of worker rights.

In their responses to U.S. concerns, Guatemala&#x27;s vice president, Minister of Labor, and other officials have demonstrated considerable good faith in seeking to improve the worker rights situation in their country. The United States welcomes the Ministry of Labor&#x27;s efforts to date to facilitate a resolution to the situation arising from the 1999 incident involving banana workers. There is evidence of progress in prosecuting those responsible for violence against workers in that case. We also welcome efforts by the government to suspend operating licenses of companies which have violated labor code provisions. In addition, the Guatemalan executive branch has presented legislation to bring the country&#x27;s labor laws into conformity with ILO recommendations.

It is on the basis of these actions and assurances that Guatemala has been designated at this time as a CBTPA Beneficiary Country.

Despite certain forthcoming actions and statements by Guatemalan officials, the United States remains deeply concerned that the overall worker rights environment in Guatemala represents a threat to those seeking to advance basic, internationally recognized rights for workers. Instances of anti-union violence, including occasional murders, persist. The widespread impunity for those who provoke and carry out such violence is a particularly severe concern.

Consequently, Guatemala&#x27;s CBTPA beneficiary status will be reviewed in April 2001, with a focus on further improvements in the area of worker rights. This review will include the following objectives: a) an assessment that the Guatemalan executive branch is taking all actions within its authority to ensure the physical safety and human and civil rights of union leaders and the effective criminal prosecution of persons charged with provoking anti-union violence, including killings of union leaders; b) assurances that the Government of Guatemala is taking all steps within its power to provide for the re-employment of the 900 fired banana workers and settlement of related labor law violations; c) further progress towards enacting the new Labor Code; and d) further improvements in labor law enforcement and judicial administration related to the protection of labor rights.

As a further sign of the seriousness with which the United States views these issues, Ambassador Barshefsky is initiating immediately a review of Guatemala&#x27;s eligibility as a beneficiary country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This unprecedented self-initiated review will also be concluded in April 2001, and will focus on the government&#x27;s response to anti-union violence and other aspects of internationally recognized worker rights.

==Worker Rights Monitoring in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua==

Worker rights issues were also pursued in the context of the CBTPA eligibility review of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. With respect to El Salvador, the United States raised concerns regarding the effect of certain privatization programs in restricting union activity, as well as excessive legal formalities applied to the establishment of trade unions. In Honduras, the United States focused on the government&#x27;s efforts to revise the Honduran labor code to reflect
recommendations made by the International Labour Organization. In Nicaragua, the U.S. expressed particular concern with respect to anti-union activity at two apparel factories in the Las Mercedes Free Trade Zone, and successfully sought the government&#x27;s assurances that workers at those factories would be informed of their rights under Nicaragua&#x27;s Labor Code.

In each of these cases, the governments in question provided responses which were helpful in addressing U.S. concerns. Nonetheless, the Administration believes that worker rights practices in these countries should be subject to ongoing monitoring. This monitoring will focus on follow-through to the commitments made by these governments in the context of the CBTPA eligibility review. In addition, the United States will request bilateral consultations with each of the three governments to discuss worker rights concerns by June 30, 2001.

<text>In a representative democracy, a paper candidate (also known as a no-hope candidate) is a candidate who stands for a political party in an electoral division where the party in question enjoys only low levels of support. Although the candidate has little chance of winning, a major party will normally make an effort to ensure it has its name on the ballot paper in every constituency. In two-party systems, a paper candidate may also be known as token opposition. In Dutch-speaking countries, the last candidate on a party list is called a &quot;lijstduwer&quot; and is usually a well-known non-politician such as an artist, celebrity or sports person, chosen to attract more votes for the party.

A dummy candidate is similar to a paper candidate in that both types do not expect to win their race; however, they differ in that a dummy candidate typically has an ulterior motive for being in the race, such as to dishonestly divert votes away from more legitimate candidates or to take advantage of benefits afforded to political candidates. Another related concept is the stalking horse candidate, a junior or little-known politician who challenges an incumbent to test the support for a more serious challenge from someone else.

== United States ==

Paper candidates may be local party members, or members from neighbouring areas or from central office depending on the laws of the jurisdiction; most U.S. states, for example, require all candidates for state and local office to reside in the district they intend on representing for a certain length of time. The main purpose of fielding paper candidates is to maintain or improve the profile of a political party and, in two-party systems, to provide at least nominal opposition to a seemingly unassailable incumbent. Another potential use for paper candidacy is to allow a candidate who wants off the ballot of another race to do so by running for something else, a race they cannot possibly win (such as Rick Lazio, who lost a Republican primary for New York Governor in 2010 but still had a third-party ballot line; in order to disqualify himself from the gubernatorial election Lazio was nominated for a judicial seat in the Bronx that was so heavily Democratic that he could not have possibly won if he wanted to, and he did not). The paper candidates themselves typically do little or no campaigning and neither incur nor claim any expenses.

There are circumstances where a paper candidate can win an election, often when the opposing candidate is unexpectedly embroiled in scandal; for example, then-27-year-old American Chris Smith, who ran as a token opponent to New Jersey congressman Frank Thompson in 1978 and 1980, won the latter contest after Thompson was embroiled in the Abscam scandal. Another example is Michael Patrick Flanagan, a little-known Republican attorney who defeated longtime Democratic incumbent Dan Rostenkowski, the onetime powerful Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, in a heavily Democratic Chicago-based district after Rostenkowski was indicted on charges of mail fraud. The victory occurred in 1994 as part of a national Republican wave.

In jurisdictions with strict campaign finance and spending laws governing elections, it is often a legal necessity to run the maximum number candidates permitted (or close thereto) in order to spend the maximum amount of money otherwise permitted by law. In such cases, parties will run paper candidates, but will usually endeavour to use the extra spending allowance afforded (at least to the extent that it may be permitted in the jurisdiction) to campaign in districts where they have a realistic chance of winning.

In Puerto Rico, every party has to run candidates thus paper candidates can occur when parties form alliances.

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, major parties often find it difficult to field a full list of candidates for all council seats up for election, especially in the case of councils with &quot;all-up&quot; elections. Parties find it desirable to persuade people to stand as paper candidates so that:

* Supporters have an opportunity to vote for the party
* The total vote obtained across the council and the nation is maximised
* All seats are contested so there is no risk that candidates from other parties can be declared elected unopposed

In Britain, being nominated as a local election candidate simply involves signing some forms, with no deposit required. A paper candidate will often do no campaigning at all and so be able to submit a zero return of election expenses, simplifying the paperwork for the election agent. Paper candidates are commonly fielded in different locations by all the major parties in both local and national elections.

Some paper candidates stand in order to help their party but do not wish to be elected to the post in question. In fact, some paper candidates only agree to stand after receiving assurances that there is no &quot;risk&quot; of them getting elected. Following the Scottish National Party&#x27;s landslide in Scotland in the 2015 general election, when they went from 6 to 56 seats (out of 59 Scottish seats), it was reported that some candidates were so surprised at winning they considered resigning immediately after the election. In the 2019 general election, some Conservative candidates were selected just weeks prior to the election and won seats in the Labour &quot;red wall&quot; in northern England and Wales, which were previously considered unwinnable by the party. After joining Reform UK in 2024, James McMurdock won South Basildon and East Thurrock in that year&#x27;s general election after the party—without enough people to run for available seats—asked him to serve as a paper candidate.

In Belfast North at the 2017 election, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) were criticised for standing Martin McAuley as a &quot;paper candidate&quot; — a deliberately weak candidate, a 26-year-old with little experience, on the assumption that nationalist and Catholic voters would instead vote for Sinn Féin, instead of the unionist candidate Nigel Dodds (DUP). McAuley rejected the label of &quot;paper candidate&quot; Dodds narrowly won the election. In 2019, the SDLP did not field a candidate in Belfast North and Sinn Féin won the seat. The SDLP were also accused of standing a &quot;paper candidate,&quot; Mary Garrity, in Fermanagh and South Tyrone in 2017, in order to help Sinn Féin win the seat from the UUP.

==Ireland==

In Ireland, the single transferable vote system is used, so paper candidates are less common and more seats are up for grabs. However, there have been cases of unexpected surges for certain parties (such as Labour in 1992 and Sinn Féin in 2020) that led to many paper candidates being unexpectedly elected. This was epitomised in 1992 with Moosajee Bhamjee, Ireland&#x27;s first Indian and first Muslim TD, who only stood in Clare because no one else in the local Labour party wanted to. In 2020, many inexperienced Sinn Féin candidates won, such as Claire Kerrane (Roscommon–Galway) and Violet-Anne Wynne (Clare), both of whom had never held an elected office before and were the first Sinn Féin TDs in those counties since the 1920s. On the other hand, the success of the Social Democrats in the 2020 election was attributed to their lack of paper candidates: they fielded candidates in just 20 out of 39 constituencies and won 6 TDs.

== Canada ==

In Canada, paper candidates may exist at both the federal and provincial / territorial levels, while the term does not apply in municipal elections as official parties do not exist at the city council level. As in Great Britain, they most commonly exist to allow the main political parties to field candidates in as many constituencies as possible. From 2004 to 2011, parties at the federal level had a financial incentive to draw as many votes as possible due to a per-vote subsidy, paid to all parties with at least 2% of the total popular vote regardless of the number of seats actually won. This payment, enacted under a Liberal government, was fully eliminated in 2015 under a Conservative government.

Nevertheless, even without per-vote subsidies, parties have other strong incentives to maximize their overall popular vote. In particular, even though winning the popular vote in itself conveys no special rights or privileges in the Canadian electoral system, there have been multiple instances (especially at the provincial level) where a party that has won the popular vote but &quot;not&quot; a plurality of seats has attempted to claim a mandate to govern, often using its popular vote victory to justify such claims. Political parties therefore have an incentive to ensure at all costs that the entire electorate can at least vote for them.

Paper candidates are sometimes used if the party is not seriously contesting the election but must run candidates so it can either get registered or stay registered for some other purpose. In such cases, paper candidates will usually run in districts where ideologically like-minded parties are seen to have little chance of winning to minimize the risk of any nominal support they might receive proving to be the decisive margin in a close local election under Canada&#x27;s first-past-the-post electoral system.

An example of this scenario in action was found in Saskatchewan, where the Progressive Conservative Party withdrew from public presence in the late 1990s but continued to run at least ten candidates, all in urban ridings where the then-governing Saskatchewan New Democratic Party was dominant at the time, in the province&#x27;s general elections until the relevant law was amended so as to keep its registration with Elections Saskatchewan, largely to avoid losing control of what at the time was believed to be a substantial amount of money. (Most of the PCs&#x27; former politicians and grassroots members formed or joined the Saskatchewan Party.) The Progressive Conservative Party has since attempted to &quot;revive&quot; itself and no longer considers its nominees to be paper candidates. However, they have only achieved modest levels of support with candidates affiliated with the national Conservative Party typically running under the banner of the Progressive Conservative Party in provincial elections.

In neighbouring Alberta, the United Conservative Party formed from a &quot;merger&quot; of the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. However, as Albertan electoral law did not permit the parties to merge officially, both parties continue to exist on paper under the UCP leadership team. Albertan electoral law only requires a party to nominate one candidate to maintain its registration, so in the 2019 provincial election, each party ran one candidate in Edmonton-Strathcona, the riding represented by the incumbent New Democratic premier, Rachel Notley, which is widely seen to be the NDP&#x27;s safest seat. The PC candidate polled enough votes to finish in fourth place, ahead of candidates for parties running &quot;serious&quot; campaigns such as the Alberta Liberal Party.

Paper candidates in Quebec (&quot;poteau&quot; in Canadian French, suggesting that the candidate will only be seen on utility poles), particularly of the name-on-ballot variety, can sometimes provide unwanted attention for the candidate&#x27;s party, particularly if they become viable prospects for elections. For example, in the 2011 federal election, a sudden increase in opinion-poll support, particularly in Quebec, for the New Democratic Party, which historically had a minimal presence in that province, led to greater scrutiny of some of that party&#x27;s lower-profile Quebec candidates. One such candidate, Ruth Ellen Brosseau, was working as a bartender hundreds of kilometres away from the riding of Berthier—Maskinongé where she was on the ballot. She won even though she had never been in her riding, claimed no expenses for her campaign, and spoke its dominant language (Canadian French) poorly. However, Brosseau successfully shook off the label by the time of the 2015 election, having become recognized as a hard-working MP who had built a significant base of popularity in her district. She was narrowly defeated in the 2019 and 2021 elections.

The federal Progressive Conservative Party also had several paper candidates who won election in the party&#x27;s historic landslide victory in the 1984 election, such as Thomas Suluk in Nunatsiaq.

An extreme version of a paper candidate is a &quot;Name on Ballot&quot;, often referred to by the acronym &quot;NoB&quot;. Many NoBs (Names on Ballot) will only place campaign signs, and some do not even campaign at all. In most cases, the only requirement is that the candidate show up at the returning officer&#x27;s headquarters for a few moments to take an oath and pay the required nomination deposit. In a more extreme example, in Alberta, candidates do not need to show up to talk to a returning officer, as long as someone on behalf of the party drops off the required paperwork and funds. Many smaller parties, such as the Prince Edward Island New Democrats, will field most of their candidates in any given election as NoBs. The term is often worn as a badge of pride in one&#x27;s loyalty to the party. PEI New Democrat, Dr. Bob Perry, who has been a NoB many times in the past, often calls himself &quot;Dr. NoB&quot; at election time.
