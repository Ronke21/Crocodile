<text>The Toyota MR2 is a line of two-seater, mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive sports cars, manufactured in Japan and marketed globally by Toyota from 1984 until 2007 over three generations: W10 (1984–1989), W20 (1989–1999) and W30 (1999–2007). It is Japan&#x27;s first rear mid-engined production car.

Conceived as a small, economical and sporty car, the MR2 uses simple but effective design elements, including a straight-four engine, transversely mounted in front of the rear axle, four-wheel disc brakes, and fully independent coilover suspension – MacPherson strut fronts and Chapman strut rears.

The name MR2 stands for either &quot;mid-ship run-about 2-seater&quot; or &quot;mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive, 2-seater&quot;. In French-speaking markets, the vehicle was renamed Toyota MR because the abbreviation &quot;MR2&quot; sounds like the profanity &quot;merde&quot; when spoken in French.

==Origins==
The MR2 derived from a 1976 Toyota design project with the goal of a car which would be enjoyable to drive, yet still provide good fuel economy – not necessarily a sports car. Design work began in 1979 when Akio Yoshida from Toyota&#x27;s testing department started to evaluate alternatives for engine placement and drive method, finalizing a mid-transverse engine placement. Toyota called the 1981 prototype SA-X.

From its original design, the car evolved into a sports car, and further prototypes were tested both in Japan and in the US. Significant testing was performed on race circuits including Willow Springs, where former Formula One driver Dan Gurney tested the car.

All three generations were in compliance with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement. The MR2 appeared around the same time as the Honda CR-X and the Nissan EXA from Japan, the Pontiac Fiero and Ford EXP from North America, and about a decade after the VW Scirocco and Fiat X1/9 from Europe made their debut.

Toyota debuted its SV-3 concept car in October 1983 at the Tokyo Motor Show, gathering press and audience publicity. The car was scheduled for a Japanese launch in the second quarter of 1984 under the name MR2.

== First generation (W10; 1984–1989)==


Toyota introduced the first-generation MR2 in 1984, designating it the model code &quot;W10&quot;. When fitted with the 1.5-liter &quot;3A&quot; engine, it was known as the &quot;AW10&quot;. Likewise, the 1.6-liter &quot;4A&quot; version is identified by the &quot;AW11&quot; code.

In Japan, the MR2 was marketed exclusively via Toyota&#x27;s &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; and &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot;, both rebranded in 1998 as &quot;Netz Toyota Store&quot;. At its introduction in 1984, the MR2 won the Car of the Year Japan.

As Toyota engineered the MR2 to accommodate a 2-liter engine, its primary features included its light body (as low as in Japan and in the US), strong handling, and low-power small-displacement engine. The car is often referred to as the AW11, referring to the chassis code of the most common 1.6-liter, A-engined versions.

The MR2&#x27;s suspension and handling were designed by Toyota with the help of Lotus engineer Roger Becker. Toyota&#x27;s cooperation with Lotus during the prototype phase can be seen in the AW11, and it owes much to Lotus&#x27;s sports cars of the 1960s and 1970s. Toyota&#x27;s active suspension technology, called TEMS, was not installed. With five structural bulkheads, the MR2 was quite heavy for a two-seater of its size.

Toyota employed the naturally aspirated 4A-GE straight-four engine, a DOHC four-valve-per-cylinder motor, borrowed from the E80 series Corolla. This engine was also equipped with Denso electronic port fuel injection and T-VIS variable intake geometry, giving the engine a maximum power output of in the US, in the UK, in Europe (with or without catalytic converter), in Australia and in Japan. Japanese models were later detuned to . A five-speed manual transmission was standard, with a four-speed automatic available as an option.

Road tests delivered 0– times in the mid- to high-8 second range and  times in the mid- to high-16 second range, significantly faster than the four-cylinder Pontiac Fiero or Fiat X1/9. In the home market, the AW10 base model was offered, which used the more economical &quot;3A-U&quot; engine rated at .

In 1986 (1988 for the US market), Toyota introduced a supercharged engine for the MR2. Based on the same block and head, the 4A-GZE was equipped with a small Roots-type supercharger and a Denso intercooler. T-VIS was eliminated and the compression ratio was lowered to 8:1. It produced at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm and accelerated the car from 0 to in 6.5 to 7.0 seconds. The supercharger was belt-driven but actuated by an electromagnetic clutch, so that it would not be driven except when needed, increasing fuel economy. Curb weight increased to as much as for supercharged models, due to the weight of the supercharger equipment and a new, stronger transmission. A fuel selector switch was also added in some markets, to allow the car to run on regular unleaded fuel if required. In addition to the new engine, the MR2 SC was also equipped with stiffer springs, and received special &quot;tear-drop&quot; aluminum wheels. The engine cover had two raised vents (only one of which was functional) that visually distinguished it from the naturally aspirated models. It was also labeled &quot;SUPER CHARGER&quot; on the rear trunk and body mouldings behind both doors. This model was never offered outside of the Japanese and North American markets, although some cars were privately imported to other countries.

===Yearly changes===


MK1a and MK1b are unofficial designations, but are frequently used by owners and vendors to distinguish between early production vehicles and later face-lifted models. While there are considerable differences detailed below, the most notable being that rear suspension components are not interchangeable between the MK1a and MK1b cars.

;MK1a – June 1984 (MY 1985)
Original introduction

;June 1985 (MY 1986)

*Japanese model changes:
**Supercharged model introduced, offered with four-speed A/T or five-speed M/T
**T-bar roof option available
*Color-keyed front lip and bumpers, side stripes, mudflaps, side skirts option now available
*Mudflap removed for models equipped with &quot;Aerodynamic Spoiler Package&quot; as the side skirts are full-length along the side
*Rear sunshade with TOYOTA logo above rear window added
*Third brake light added
*Leather interior option now available
*Bigger 212 mm flywheel and clutch for naturally aspirated models
*Rear anti-roll bar discontinued on North American models

;MK1b Facelift – August 1986 (MY 1987)

*Powertrain changes:
**Naturally aspirated &quot;4A-GE&quot; now upgraded with a &quot;7-rib&quot; structural design as well as larger connecting rods. North American 4A-GE is also now rated at .
**Intake camshaft valve cover now has the &quot;16 Valve&quot; portion in red instead of blue (this is not to be confused with the smallport third generation 4A-GE where the intake camshaft cover lettering has the entire &quot;Twin Cam 16 Valve&quot; in red)
**EGR port repositioned on exhaust manifold to prevent cracking
**Revised manual transmission internals.
**Air filter rerouted to the trunk and continues around the trunk towards the air vent on the opposite side of the engine bay.
*Chassis changes:
**Slight unibody changes
**Radiator tilted back at an angle to force air down towards the bottom of the car
**Revised rear suspension
**Larger front and rear brake rotors
**New tail lights (UK models retained old tail light design with different integrated reflector)
**New front lip and front bumper
**Radio antenna moved to rear right quarter panel for t-top/sunroof models
**T-bar roof available in North America and Europe
*Interior changes:
**LHD models now have parking brake on the right side
**New center console, center armrest
**Glovebox lock
**Double-din radio, rear speakers added to the upper C pillar
**Door panels, three-spoke steering wheel, gauge cluster markings
**Seat changed to single-color velour and perforations added for leather seats

;1987 (MY 1988)
*Supercharged model available in North America
*Color-coded side mirrors and new engine lid for supercharged models
*Full-length side skirts now standard on all models
*Heater water pipes changed from zinc-plated steel to brass

;1988 (MY 1989)
*T-bar glass panels changed from smoked (clear) to mirrored (opaque)
*Color-code door handle and side mirrors for all models
*Incandescent third brake lamp replaced by LED strip integrated into the rear spoiler
*More aerodynamic wing mirrors introduced, with optional power retract mechanism
*North American supercharged models equipped with rear anti-roll bar

The changes in MY 1986 and MY 1987 occurred in parts. Instead of a drastic change in MY 1987 models for the above MK1b upgrades, some MK1a parts continued on in early MY 1987 cars while some MK1b parts came on MY 1986 cars as options. An example is that some MY 1987 cars still retained the old &quot;flat&quot; front bumper despite having MK1b upgrades everywhere else on the car. Some early MY 1987 7-rib engines came with the earlier blue top valve cover. This was also noticed in the rear sway bar removal for the MY 1986. Some MY 1986 cars have a rear sway bar, while the mounting tabs on the strut housing were either there for both sides, only one side, or none at all depending on when Toyota ran out of the older rear struts with mounting tabs as production used up parts.

===Reception===
American car magazines &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; both chose the MR2 on their &quot;ten best&quot; car lists. The Australian &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine chose the 1988 MR2 as its favourite sports car. The MR2 was &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Import Car of the Year for 1985. The MR2 was also on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1986 and 1987. In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; ranked the MR2 number eight on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s.

In 1988 and 1989 Toyota produced two final production runs of fully optioned &quot;Super Edition&quot; MR2s, based upon the supercharged Japanese market model, and only sold in Japan. The 1988 &#x27;Super Edition&#x27; was a run of 300 units, had white/gold two-tone paint, bronze glass, unique half-leather and half-cloth seats, along with a MOMO-commissioned steering wheel and gear knob. The 1989 model, a run of 270 units, featured a special Midnight Blue paint, the MOMO-commissioned steering wheel and gear knob, Recaro &quot;Milano&quot; seats with matching door panels. The 1989 model also benefited from some of the last G-Limited model options, such as the LED rear spoiler brake light and more aerodynamic wing mirrors. Both &quot;Super Edition&quot; models had unique decals on the rear visor and side stripes.

=== Motorsport (W10)===
==== Toyota 222D rally car ====
While Toyota&#x27;s front-engine, rear-drive Celica rally cars proved dominant in the African Group B rallies of the 1980s, they were at a disadvantage on the twistier European stages. Thus, Toyota Team Europe started a rally project in 1985, codenamed &quot;222D&quot; based on the MR2, for competition in Group S and potentially Group B. Though somewhat similar on the outside, it is clear that the prototype had very little in common with the production car although the two appear to share the same factory AW11 floor pan. Little else is known about the project as it never competed. With Group B cancelled in 1986, the proposed Group S regulations suffered the same fate, and the remaining prototypes were reduced to museum pieces and private collections. Supposedly eleven prototypes were made, of which eight were destroyed during testing, leaving only three known examples: Two in black, one stored at Toyota Gazoo&#x27;s facility in Cologne and one sold to a private collector in 2017, one in white, with a 50mm lengthened wheelbase and a more production styled body located in Tokyo.

Although the 222D was still a prototype, it made it very far into development before Group B was canceled. Of the rumored eleven built, eight were destroyed in testing, indicating Toyota was considering bringing the 222D to competition. However, the short wheelbase proved to be a challenge during testing, as the 222D also suffered from enormous turbo lag (as did most of the competitive Group B cars), but paired with the extremely short wheel base made driving at speed almost impossible.Toyota Team Europe owner Ove Anderson describes: &quot;you never knew what it was going to do. With such a short wheelbase and such power in such a light car it could swap ends at any time, and without any warning&quot;.

During a surprise appearance at the 2006 Goodwood Festival of Speed, Toyota drove and displayed a black 222D. The race-ready car weighed around and its transverse-mounted, four-cylinder, turbocharged engine (what appears to be a 503E race engine, though other prototypes may have used the 4T-GTE) was reported to produce as much as .
== Second generation (W20; 1989–1999)==

The MR2 went through a redesign in 1989 (though North America did not receive them until early 1990 as 1991 models). The new car was larger, weighed more than its predecessor due to having a more luxurious and spacious cabin, larger engine sizes, sturdier transaxle, and a more durable suspension setup. The overall design of the automobile received more rounded, streamlined styling, with some calling the MR2 SW20 a &quot;baby Ferrari&quot; or &quot;poor man&#x27;s Ferrari&quot; due to design cues similar to the Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS or Ferrari 348.

Like the AW11 before it, Toyota spent countless hours fine-tuning the handling capabilities of the SW20, seeking advice from professional race car drivers, including Dan Gurney of Formula One, NASCAR, and Le Mans fame.

When the AW11 was still in production and before the SW20 was officially shown to the public, several rumors were spreading stating that Toyota was building yet another mid-engine sports car, one that would have a 3.0-liter V6 engine that could directly compete with the 348, though this specific rumor was later shot down under the pretense that such a car would belong under the Lexus branding.

*Japanese market trim levels:
#G with an NA 2.0L 3S-GE engine producing ; with an A/T standard and an optional M/T. The G was the base model of the SW20 line-up. Standard features included: manual steering, manual climate control but no air conditioning, electric mirror adjustment but manual folding, and fabric door/seat trim. The rear spoiler was optional.
#G-Limited with the NA 2.0L 3S-GE engine; an A/T was standard or an M/T was optional. The G-Limited was the higher-specification naturally aspirated SW20. Additional standard features: electric folding mirrors, power steering, steering fog lamps, and rear spoiler.
#GT-S with a turbocharged 2.0L 3S-GTE engine producing ; an M/T was the only choice. The GT-S had the same standard features as the G-Limited.
#GT with the turbocharged 2.0L 3S-GTE engine and manual transmission. The GT was considered as the luxury specification in the SW20 line-up and had alcantera/leather door and seat trim in addition to G-Limited standard features. All Japanese market cars came equipped with electronic climate control featuring 2 stage air conditioning.

*European market trim levels:
#Coupe with the NA 2.0L 3S-FE engine producing (not available with T-bar roof). This model had no rear spoiler or front fog lights
#GT-i Coupe with the NA 2.0L 3S-GE engine producing .
#GT-i T-Bar with the NA 2.0L 3S-GE engine. Options included as standard were full leather seats/door cards and the premium 8 speaker audio system.
:There were no turbo models officially offered to the European market; however, many Japanese models were sold via the grey market.

*US market trim levels:
#MR2 with a NA 2.2L 5S-FE engine producing and offered with a four-speed A/T or five-speed M/T.
#MR2 Turbo with a turbocharged 2.0L 3S-GTE engine producing at 6,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm of torque, offered only with a 5-speed M/T (offered solely with the T-bar roof after early 1993).

Differences between the normally aspirated and turbocharged models include the &quot;Turbo&quot; emblem (US) on the rear trunk, &#x27;TWIN CAM 16 TURBO&#x27; decal above the side intake (Japanese market), a fiberglass engine lid with raised vents, fog lights, and an added interior center storage compartment located between the two seats. All SW20 MR2s came with a staggered wheel setup, with wider wheels and tires in the rear than in the front.

Mechanical differences on the Turbo models include:
*3S-GTE engine with associated air-to-air intercooler and different exhaust configuration;
*Stronger and heavier E153 gearbox with different ratios and stronger axles;
*Larger fuel pump and radiator.
*Models with 3S-GE and 3S-GTE engines had twin-piston front brake calipers. Models with the 5S-FE engine had only single-piston calipers.

The US market MR2 Turbo model was able to accelerate from in 6.1 seconds and finish the 1/4 mile in 14.7 seconds.

The Revision 1 Turbo SW20 can pull 0.89g at the skidpad, with later revisions averaging 0.90g – 0.94.

Revision 2 cars were fitted with Yokohama A022s; coincidentally, the Honda NSX also uses a special variant of the A022.

A Japanese market Rev 3 GT-S Turbo was able to run the 1/4 mile in 13.1 seconds, beating out more expensive and higher powered automobiles such as the Honda NSX, Toyota Supra RZ, and even the Ferrari 348 TB.

Best Motoring, a popular Japanese automobile TV show, featured an episode that had them battle a factory stock Rev 5 GT-S Turbo versus other Japanese market contemporaries on the Tsukuba Circuit, with the MR2 winning the circuit race. In the rankings of personal bests, a Rev 2 GT-S was able to clock 1:08.00 at Tsukuba Circuit.


===Revisions and model year changes===
The second-generation MR2 underwent a variety of changes during its 10 years of production, grouped in four different periods:

;1989 (Revision 1)
Introduction of the new generation.

*Japan receives the new BEAMS 3S-GE rated at 

Changes to the suspension geometry, tire sizes and power steering in January 1992 (MY 1993) were made in response to journalist reports that the MR2 was prone to &quot;snap-oversteer&quot;. As a counterpoint to the snap-oversteer phenomenon of the MR2, other journalists point out that most mid-engine and rear-engine sports and super cars exhibit similar behaviour, and that a change to the driver&#x27;s response to oversteer is really the solution. In any car, braking shifts the weight forward, and acceleration to the rear. When drivers enter a corner with too much speed, and lift the throttle mid-corner, the weight transfers forward causing the rear tires to lose traction (called lift-off oversteer), which can result in a spin. When improper steering inputs were made attempting to correct this non-power-on oversteer, the rear of the MR2 would swing one way, then wildly (and quickly) the other—thus the term &quot;snap&quot; oversteer. Toyota elected to change the MR2 suspension and tires to reduce the likelihood that this would occur, though many drivers would lament the change and claim that it &quot;neutered&quot; the sharp edge the MR2 was known for. Toyota claimed that the changes were made &quot;for drivers whose reflexes were not those of Formula One drivers&quot;.

===Special variants===

====TRD2000GT====
In 1998, Toyota Racing Development offered an official kit body conversion and tuning program for MR2 owners to transform their existing SW20 MR2 into a wide-body TRD2000GT replica car. This was to pay homage to the TRD2000GT wins in the GT-C Japanese racing series, since the TRD2000GT racing series cars were based on the SW20 floor pan. The TRD2000GT body kit widened the MR2 by a total of . Prior to MR2s being fitted with the TRD2000GT body kit, TRD had its customers select which additional engine, suspension, wheel, and interior upgrades they wanted. For this reason, no two TRD2000GT MR2s are alike. It is rumored that at least one was built to produce up to whereas some others had few modifications to their engines.

In order to ensure exclusivity, a high price tag was charged and total of just 35 factory car conversions were completed by Toyota Technocraft Ltd. Each official Technocraft-converted car was made using lightweight fiberglass components (front fenders, trunk lid extension, rear quarter panels, gas door, front and rear bumpers, 3-piece wing) and re-classified as completely new cars (with their own specially numbered TRD VIN plate riveted to the body to indicate their authenticity and rarity).

The Toyota Technocraft Ltd. TRD2000GT had a wider front and rear track (due to the addition of wider wheels and tires). Virtually every car converted also had other TRD parts fitted too, including extensive changes to both the suspension and engine. Most cars left the factory making more power due to TRD bolt-ons, some cars even left the factory boasting up to and less than 1100 kg (2425 lb) for a very impressive power-to-weight ratio. While TRD Japan only offered a small number of kits with all body parts required for third-party conversion, Toyota Technocraft Ltd. offered complete car conversions.

Apart from the cars listed on the TRD2000GT register it is unknown how many original Toyota Technocraft Ltd. cars still exist today, but it is rumored that approximately 10 conversion kits were imported from TRD Japan into the US for conversions. In many respects, the extended body can be compared to that of a Porsche 911 Slantnose modification. The car&#x27;s width is extended and body dimensions dramatically changing the car&#x27;s overall visuals. Very little is known about these cars outside Japan.

====TOM&#x27;S T020====


Apart from Toyota Racing Development, TOM&#x27;S also released official body kits and a variety of tuning parts for the MR2. The &quot;T020&quot; as it was called, was powered by a naturally aspirated 2.2L stroked 3S-GE that produced at 6,800 rpm, this was due to more aggressive &quot;F3&quot; cams, a stroker kit, better intake flow with the aid of the &quot;TOM&#x27;S Hyper Induction Carbon&quot; intake kit, and an upgraded exhaust system labeled the &quot;TOM&#x27;S Barrel&quot;, a lightened flywheel was also equipped to help the engine rev easier. The T020 also featured a more race-oriented suspension/chassis set up via camber kits, upgraded tie-rods, strut bars, roll center adjusters, stiffer springs, race shock absorbers, and sports brake pads. These modifications lowered the vehicle&#x27;s center of gravity for increased agility and stability while cornering, and combined with the engine modifications enabling the T020 to accelerate from in 4.9 seconds, in turn further made the SW20 chassis a much more capable track machine. A sportier look was given to the vehicle as well through engine scoops, side skirts, a Ferrari 348-esque rear light grille, forged wheels, revised bumper designs, and a larger rear spoiler.

Though undeniably still an MR2, the T020 was in all essence a more refined automobile, as is the nature of any TOM&#x27;S outfitted vehicle. Whilst the T020 was a normally aspirated vehicle, TOM&#x27;S also produced equipment for turbocharged models — e.g. wastegates, boost controllers, air filters, a 3S-GTE version of their &quot;TOM&#x27;S Barrel&quot; exhaust system, and &quot;T.E.C. II&quot; Engine Control Units. Despite the fact that these products are no longer purchasable brand new, some of these modification parts may still be procured as second-hand items, and are highly sought after by the MR2 community. TOM&#x27;S still keeps a T020 part list on their website, and there are still T020 part catalogues in circulation between enthusiasts to this day, albeit second-hand.

====SW20 Spider====
Between 1996 and 1999, Toyota TechnoCraft (TTC) produced 88 or 91 SW20 MR2 Spider convertible conversions. These cars featured a retractable cloth softtop roof and exclusive wingless trunk and engine lids. Most Spiders had automatic transmissions, naturally aspirated engines, and Lucerne Silver paint with blue side mouldings and black and blue accented cloth seats. The Toyota name and logo were not applied to these cars due to concerns about roof leaks.

=== Aftermarket ===
During its production, the SW20 enjoyed a myriad of tuning parts from Japanese tuners such as HKS, Blitz, Phoenix Power, etc. While some companies only offered aesthetic modifications for the SW20, others such as Phoenix Power offered modifications such as a tuned ECU, longblock modifications, and a trunk-mounted intercooler combined with a T04R Turbocharger. The Phoenix Power MR2 also featured a large rear wing reminiscent of the 911 (993) GT2 for increased downforce at high speeds, and a reworked suspension set up with Öhlins equipment. Japanese tuner Border Racing, made available several parts as well, consisting mostly of parts that improved the car&#x27;s suspension geometry, namely roll-center adapters, extended tie rods, etc., though they have also produced intercooler kits for the car and several interior pieces. AP Racing at a time also produced a brake kit as well for the MR2, but this has been discontinued. Performance parts manufacturer JUN offered engine upgrades for the MR2&#x27;s 3S-GTE engine which came in the form of stroker kits, which were co-developed with Cosworth, and also offered lightened flywheels, cam gears, and camshafts.

The 2GR-FE V6, used in various Toyota and Lexus models, is a popular engine swap candidate for the MR2, especially the SW20 generation.

=== Reception ===
The SW20 garnered generally favorable reviews during its production life, with various sources complimenting the styling, power, and responsive handling. Car and Driver noted the revised SW20&#x27;s braking capabilities to be superb, stating that 70 mph to standstill could be done in 157 feet, rivaling that of the Honda NSX. Former Top Gear host and racing driver Tiff Needell commends the SW20&#x27;s handling having said that it &quot;encourages you to drive with enthusiasm&quot; in a review back in 1990. He does note however, that the sudden transition from understeer to oversteer may be startling for some people.

The car is infamously known for its &quot;snap-oversteer&quot; phenomenon. This notoriety comes from numerous instances where individuals crash their SW20s either on or off the race track due to inexperience with a mid-ship platform, as MR layouts handle very differently in comparison to the more common FF or even FR layouts. Even in its revised state from January 1992, the SW20 still has a large enough following to be labeled as a very challenging car to push to its limits, with some labeling it as &quot;the most dangerous car that you can buy&quot;. Such a label may be true as MR2s are relatively cheaper than most automobiles with an MR platform (Honda NSX, Ferrari F355, Lotus Elise) and that it is readily available to most people.

=== Motorsport (W20)===
Early in the 1990s, the SW20 enjoyed considerable success throughout the world. Several teams fielded the MR2 in the Swiss Touring Car Championship, as well as in the South-East Asian Supercar Championship, with much success. The chassis was also used for a time during the mid 90s in the Fuji Freshman Series in Japan in which the SW20 succeeded the earlier AE86 chassis. , both the SW20 and ZZW30 chassis are used in 750 Motor Club&#x27;s MR2 Championship in the UK which started in the early 2000s.

==== SARD MC8-R ====
SARD (Sigma Advanced Research Development) built a heavily modified and lengthened version of the SW20 for GT racing called the SARD MC8-R. It used a heavily modified MR2 frontal chassis with a custom rear chassis made to fit a twin-turbo version of the 4.0-liter 1UZ-FE V8 producing . This is the first car which only used the frontal chassis of a production car and was effectively a purpose-built semi-sports-prototype that successfully got GT1 homologation. The overall construction method of this car (a heavily modified production car frontal chassis with race-built rear chassis combined into a style of semi-prototype) inspired Porsche to make 911 GT1 homologation specials which dominates the GT1, and foreshadowed the cancellation of GT1.

==== Japanese Grand Touring Championship (now Super GT) ====
With JGTC being the highest form of sports car racing in Japan, many manufacturers and private teams alike spent countless hours of research and development into perfecting their respective chassis. Toyota would enter their premier production cars, namely the Celica, MR2, and Supra. Unlike the experimental MC8-R, the MR2 JGTC shared more qualities chassis wise to the road-going production car, though it had a lower ride height than the standard SW20s, was wider, featured advanced aerodynamics and Brembo racing brakes. While it kept the MacPherson suspension setup from the road car, these components too were heavily modified (strut towers were more inward). The standard E153 5-speed transmission was swapped out for a race sequential transmission, which was mated to a race-spec version of the 3S-GTE engine. With the car&#x27;s interior gutted, the intercooler was placed in the forward section of the vehicle with pipes travelling to and fro inside the cabin, as opposed to in the engine bay as a &quot;side-mount&quot; in production MR2s. Having won back to back in the years 1998 to 1999 against arguably more sophisticated race cars such as the BMW M3, Porsche 911, Ferrari F355, Toyota has proven that the SW20 chassis was competitive enough for top level sports car racing.

1998
*Team Taisan Jr. with Tsuchiya campaigned a MR2 #25 powered by the factory 3S-GTE powerplant in the 1998 JGTC season. Keiichi Suzuki and Shingo Tachi drove an amazing five GT300 victories out of six races (as the Fuji Speedway race was cancelled due to inclement weather and several accidents), winning the teams&#x27; and drivers&#x27; championship for GT300 accumulating a total of 106 points. Their #25 MR2 also participated and won the &quot;All-Star race&quot; at the end of the year.

1999
*For following year, Team Taisan Jr. moved to a Porsche chassis in GT300, while MOMOCORSE A&#x27;PEX Racing Team with Tsuchiya campaigned a crimson MR2 and won both teams&#x27; and drivers&#x27; championships. Morio Nitta and Shinichi Takagi drove to one victory, two 2nd places, and one third place to secure the teams&#x27; championship, with Nitta winning the drivers&#x27; championship by just one point over the Nismo Silvia that was driven by Takeshi Tsuchiya and Yuji Ide. Momocorse Racing would move to the MR-S chassis for the 2000 season, marking the end of the SW20&#x27;s participation in JGTC.

==== Land speed record ====
In 1992, Dennis Aase, a member of Toyota&#x27;s American factory team, became the first driver to achieve over in the cars class as he took his SW20 to a average. The car posted on the two opposing runs required for the record.

The car, which previously saw action at the Firestone Firehawk Endurance Championship by P. J. Jones, ran with a boost of with changes to the intake and exhaust systems and the cam timing, output a maximum of . The car ran with its stock body apart minus wing mirrors and wiper blades. His attempt at improving his record the following year was thwarted by poor weather.

, the G/BGT record (Class G, Blown Grand Touring Sports or 2 Liter production turbo-charged GT) still stands.

== Third generation (W30; 1999–2007)==


The third-generation MR2 was marketed as the Toyota MR-S in Japan, Toyota MR2 Spyder in the US and Australia, and the Toyota MR2 Roadster in Europe, except for France and Belgium, where it was marketed as the Toyota MR Roadster.

Also known as the Midship Runabout-Sports, the newest MR2 took a different approach than its predecessor, most obviously becoming a convertible and receiving the &#x27;Spyder&#x27; marketing nomenclature.


The first prototype of MR-S appeared in 1997 at the Tokyo Motor Show. The MR2 Spyder chief engineer Harunori Shiratori said, &quot;First, we wanted true driver enjoyment, blending good movement, low inertia, and lightweight. Then, a long wheelbase to achieve high stability and fresh new styling; a mid-engine design to create excellent handling and steering without the weight of the engine upfront; a body structure as simple as possible to allow for easy customizing, and low cost to the consumer.&quot;

The only engine available for the ZZW30 was the all-aluminum alloy 1ZZ-FE, a straight-four engine. Like its predecessors, it used DOHC and 4 valves per cylinder. The intake camshaft timing was adjustable via the VVT-i system, which was introduced earlier on the 1998 MR2 in some markets. Unlike its predecessors, however, the engine was placed onto the car the other way round, with the exhaust manifold towards the rear of the car instead of towards the front. The maximum power of at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm was quite a drop from the previous generation, but thanks to the lightness of the car it could still move quite quickly, accelerating from 0 to in 6.8 to 8.7 seconds depending on the transmission option, the SMT being unable to launch and shift as quickly as the conventional manual transmission. Curb weight is for manual transmission models.

In addition to the 5-speed manual transmission, a 6-speed manual and 5-speed SMT were made available starting in 2002. A form of automated manual transmission, the SMT has no conventional H-pattern shift lever nor clutch pedal. The driver shifts gears by tapping the shift lever forward or backward or by pressing steering-wheel-mounted buttons. Clutch engagement is automated, and the system modulates the throttle on downshifts, matching engine speed to transmission speed seamlessly. The system prioritizes clutch life over shift speed, hence shifts and launches are slower and gentler than those a human driver can perform using a conventional manual transmission, hindering rapid acceleration somewhat. Unlike similar systems offered in contemporary sports cars, the SMT lacks a fully automated mode emulating an automatic transmission. The SMT automatically shifts to second (in the 6-speed) and then first gear when stopping (5-speed only shifts automatically down to 1st). The SMT was a standard feature in the Australian market; however, air conditioning was optional. Torsen LSD was also standard on Australian delivered cars. After 2003, a 6-speed SMT was an option. Cruise control was never offered with the manual transmission but was standard for SMT-equipped cars (cruise control was not standard in Australia). In top gear at the SMT spins at 2,780 rpm rather than 3,000 rpm for the 5-speed manual at the same speed – making it slightly quieter and giving better economy, even with the extra weight. In Australia, SMT-equipped cars had the same 4.3 short-ratio final-drive as the manual versions in other markets. The drawback to the SMT is slower acceleration (due to delayed gear changes) and very few technicians actually understand the more complex system, making repairs costly.

The MR2 Spyder featured a heated glass rear window. A hardtop was also available from Toyota in Japan and Europe. Cargo volume was extremely limited, with only of usable space under the front trunk and an additional in an area behind the seats.

===Yearly changes===
;October 1999 (MY 2000)
The MR-S was introduced in October 1999 to the Japanese market in three trim levels: the &quot;B&quot;, the &quot;Standard&quot;, and the &quot;S&quot;. The &quot;S&quot; trim level included power windows, locks, mirrors, AM/FM/CD radio, cloth seats, tilt steering wheel, and alloy wheels.

In March 2000, the car was introduced into the United States and Europe as a &quot;monospec&quot; level, which included the same features as Japan&#x27;s &quot;S&quot; trim level. In October 2000 the car was introduced in Australia as a 5-speed SMT only.

;2001 (MY 2002)
*5-speed SMT introduced in the US.

;2002 (MY 2003)
*New paint colors
*New front and rear fascias, standard fog lights, power antennae, and color-matched side air intakes
*16-inch rear wheels with larger tires
*New seats, slight changes to the gauge cluster and interior
*SMT now has six forward gears and faster shifting
*New springs, dampers, and a new underbody brace

;2003 (MY 2004)

*Torsen (helical) limited-slip differential available as an option (C65-01B transmission)
*Strengthened unibody for crash intrusion protection (resulting in greater curb weight)
*Ride height increased approximately 1 inch in all markets

;2004 (MY 2005)
*6-disc in-dash CD player standard
*Last year of sales in North America

;2006 (MY 2007)
*Last year of sales
*Special &quot;V-Edition&quot; and &quot;TF300&quot; editions sold only in the United Kingdom.
*Some of Final Edition have Burgundy soft top.

===Performance and handling===
The feedback for the new model was somewhat mixed. Some liked its new design concept, while fans of the SW20 would&#x27;ve liked it to continue along the path of the previous model. All agreed, however, that the ZZW30 had nearly perfect handling. The ZZW30 is considered to be the best-handling MR2 in both overall limit and controllability. For example, Tiff Needell, a very experienced race driver and the former host of the BBC television series Top Gear, praised the handling of the ZZW30. As some complained of the relative lack of power, many owners have opted to switch out the 1ZZ-FE engine in exchange for the 2ZZ-GE.

===Productions numbers===
These are the MR2 Spyder production numbers (of North American sales figures only).
* 2000: 7,233
* 2001: 6,750
* 2002: 5,109 
* 2003: 3,249
* 2004: 2,800
* 2005: 780
* Total: 27,941

===The end of the Spyder===
In July 2004, Toyota announced that sales of the MR2 (as well as the Celica) would be discontinued in the US at the end of the 2005 model year because of lower sales numbers. The ZZW30 sold 7,233 units in its debut year, falling to just 901 for the 2005 model, for a total of 27,941 through its six years of production in the US. The 2005 model year was the last year of the MR2 in the US. While the MR2 Spyder was not sold after 2005 in the US, it still was offered in Japan, Mexico, and Europe until production of the car ceased permanently in July 2007.

===Special variants===

====VM180 Zagato====

The &quot;Toyota VM180 Zagato&quot; was designed by Zagato, based on the MR-S, and built at Toyota Modelista International for sale in Japan only through the Toyota Vista dealer network. It was first shown on 10 January 2001 in Tokyo and then at the February 2001 Geneva Motor Show. The body panels are attached to the original MR-S chassis, as can be seen by the recess around the door handles. The stock engine was tuned to produce .

====V-Edition====
As a farewell to the MR2, Toyota produced 1000 limited-production &quot;V-Edition&quot; cars for Japan and the UK. They are distinguished by different color wheels, titanium interior accents, minor body changes, a helical limited-slip differential, and different steering wheel trim.

==== TF300 ====
Also for the model year 2007, the United Kingdom received 300 models in a special numbered &quot;TF300&quot; series. A special turbocharged variant called the TTE Turbo (TTE standing for Toyota Team Europe) was available as a dealer-installed package. This package was also available for fitting to customer MR2s.

=== Motorsport (W30)===
==== Super GT ====
Between 2000 and 2008, several teams campaigned the MR-S in Super GT (known as JGTC prior to the 2004 season).

*In 2002, Morio Nitta and Shinichi Takagi shared the GT300 drivers&#x27; championship in the ARTA MR-S.
*Team Reckless&#x27;s MR-S won both the drivers&#x27; and teams&#x27; championships in 2005, driven by Kota Sasaki and Tetsuya Yamano.
*For 2007, Kazuya Oshima and Hiroaki Ishiura shared the drivers&#x27; championship in the Toy Story APR MR-S, with wins at Okayama and Sepang, but lost the teams&#x27; championship by six points to the Mooncraft Shiden prototype racer of team Privée Kenzo Asset Shiden.

== The future ==
On March 8, 2017, automotive website and magazine &quot;Evo&quot; revealed that Toyota has expressed a desire for a performance range of cars whose core has been referred to as &quot;the Three Brothers&quot; by Tetsuya Tada, chief of Toyota Gazoo Racing. This includes a lightweight mid-engined sports car, rumored to be a spiritual, if not direct, successor to the MR2.

<text>The Book of the Duchess, also known as The Deth of Blaunche, is the earliest of Chaucer&#x27;s major poems, preceded only by his short poem, &quot;An ABC&quot;, and possibly by his translation of &quot;The Romaunt of the Rose&quot;. Based on the themes and title of the poem, most sources put the date of composition after 12 September 1368 (when Blanche of Lancaster died) and before 1372, with many recent studies privileging a date as early as the end of 1368.

Overwhelming (if disputed) evidence suggests that Chaucer wrote the poem to commemorate the death of Blanche of Lancaster, wife of John of Gaunt. The evidence includes handwritten notes from Elizabethan antiquary John Stow indicating that the poem was written at John of Gaunt&#x27;s request. There are repeated instances of the word &quot;White&quot;, which is almost certainly a play on &quot;Blanche&quot;. In addition, at the end of the poem there are references to a &quot;long castel&quot;, suggesting the house of Lancaster (line 1,318) and a &quot;ryche hil&quot; as John of Gaunt was earl of Richmond (mond=hill) (line 1,319) and the narrator swears by St. John, which is the name of John of Gaunt&#x27;s saint.

==Plot summary==
At the beginning of the poem, the sleepless poet, who has suffered from an unexplained sickness for eight years (line 37), lies in his bed, reading a book. A collection of old stories, the book tells the story of Ceyx and Alcyone. The story tells of how Ceyx lost his life at sea, and how Alcyone, his wife, mourned his absence. Unsure of his fate, she prays to the goddess Juno to send her a dream vision. Juno sends a messenger to Morpheus to bring the body of Ceyx with a message to Alcyone.

The messenger finds Morpheus and relays Juno&#x27;s orders. Morpheus finds the drowned Ceyx and bears him to Alcyone three hours before dawn. The deceased Ceyx instructs Alcyone to bury him and to cease her sorrow, and when Alcyone opens her eyes Ceyx has gone.

The poet stops relaying the story of Ceyx and Alcyone and reflects that he wished that he had a god such as Juno or Morpheus so that he could sleep like Alcyone. He then describes the lavish bed he would gift to Morpheus should the god discover his location. Lost in the book and his thoughts, the poet suddenly falls asleep with the book in his hands. He states that his dream is so full of wonder that no man may interpret it correctly. He begins to relay his dream.

The poet dreams that he wakes in a chamber with windows of stained glass depictions of the tale of Troy and walls painted with the story of &quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot;. He hears a hunt, leaves the chamber, and inquires who is hunting. The hunt is revealed to be that of Octavian. The dogs are released and the hunt begins, leaving behind the poet and a small dog that the poet follows into the forest. The poet stumbles upon a clearing and finds a knight dressed in black composing a song for the death of his lady. The poet asks the knight the nature of his grief. The knight replies that he had played a game of chess with Fortuna, and lost his queen and was checkmated. The poet takes the message literally and begs the black knight not to become upset over a game of chess.

The knight begins the story of his life, reporting that for his entire life he had served Love, but that he had waited to set his heart on a woman for many years until he met one lady who surpassed all others. The knight speaks of her surpassing beauty and temperament and reveals that her name was &quot;good, fair White&quot;. The poet, still not understanding the metaphorical chess game, asks the black knight to finish the story and explain what was lost. The knight tells the story of his fumbling declaration of love and the long time it took for the love to be reciprocated and that they were in perfect harmony for many years. Still the narrator does not understand, and asks the whereabouts of White. The knight finally blurts out that White is dead. The poet realises what has occurred as the hunt ends and the poet awakes with his book still in hand. He reflects on the dream and decides that his dream is so wonderful that it should be set into rhyme.

<text>Ilya Yefimovich Repin ( – 29 September 1930) was a Russian painter who was born in what is now Ukraine. He became one of the most renowned artists in Russia in the 19th century. His major works include &quot;Barge Haulers on the Volga&quot; (1873), &quot;Religious Procession in Kursk Province&quot; (1880–1883), &quot;Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan&quot; (1885); and &quot;Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks&quot; (1880–1891). He is also known for the revealing portraits he made of the leading Russian literary and artistic figures of his time, including Mikhail Glinka, Modest Mussorgsky, Pavel Tretyakov, and especially Leo Tolstoy, with whom he had a long friendship.

Repin was born in Chuguev, in Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire. His father had served in an Uhlan Regiment in the Russian army, and then sold horses. Repin began painting icons at age sixteen. He failed at his first effort to enter the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg, but went to the city anyway in 1863, audited courses, and won his first prizes in 1869 and 1871. In 1872, after a tour along the Volga River, he presented his drawings at the Academy of Art in St. Petersburg. The Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich awarded him a commission for a large scale painting, &quot;The Barge Haulers of the Volga&quot;, which launched his career. He spent two years in Paris and Normandy, seeing the first Impressionist expositions and learning the techniques of painting in the open air.

He suffered one setback in 1885 when his history portrait of Ivan the Terrible killing his own son in a rage caused a scandal, resulting in the painting being removed from exhibition. But this was followed by a series of major successes and new commissions. In 1898, with his second wife, he purchased a country house, The Penates, in Kuokkala, Finland (now Repino, Saint Petersburg), close to St. Petersburg, where they entertained Russian society.

In 1905, following the repression of street demonstrations by the Imperial government, he quit his teaching position at the Academy of Fine Arts. He welcomed the February Revolution in 1917, but was appalled by the violence and terror unleashed by the Bolsheviks following the October Revolution. In 1917, Russia lost control over the Grand Duchy of Finland, leading to the full independence of Finland. Following this event, Ilya Repin was unable to travel to St. Petersburg (renamed Leningrad), even for an exhibition of his own works in 1925. Repin died on 29 September 1930, at the age of 86, and was buried at the Penates. His home is now a museum and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Biography==
===Early life and work===

Repin was born on 24 July 1844 in the town of Chuguev, in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire, in the heart of the historical region of Sloboda Ukraine. His father, Yefim Vasilyevich Repin (1804—1894) served in an Uhlan Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. He fought in the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) and the Hungarian campaign (1849). When his father retired from the army, after twenty-seven years of service, he became an itinerant merchant selling horses.

Repin&#x27;s mother, Tatiana Stepanovna Repina (née Bocharova) (1811—1880), was also the daughter of a soldier. She had family ties to noblemen and officers; the Repins had six children and were moderately well-off. In 1855, at the age of eleven, he was enrolled at the local school where his mother taught. He showed a talent for drawing and painting, and when he was thirteen, his father enrolled him in the workshop of Ivan Bunakov, an icon painter. He restored old icons and painted portraits of local notables. At the age of sixteen, his skill was recognized, and he became a member of an artel, or cooperative of artists, the Society for the Encouragement of Artists, which traveled around Voronezh province to paint icons and wall paintings.

Repin had much higher ambitions. In October 1863 he competed for admission to the Imperial Academy of Arts in the capital, Saint Petersburg. He failed in his first attempt, but persevered, rented a small room in the city, and took courses in academic drawing. In January 1864 he succeeded and was allowed, without fee, to attend classes.

At the academy he met the painter Ivan Kramskoi, who became his professor and mentor. When Kramskoi founded the first independent union of Russian artists, Repin became a member. In 1869 he was awarded a gold medal second-class for his painting &quot;Job and His Brothers&quot;. He met the influential critic Vladimir Stasov and painted a portrait of Vera Shevtsova, his own future wife.

=== First success ===

In 1870, with two other artists, Repin traveled to the Volga River to sketch landscapes and studies of barge haulers (The Repin House in Tolyatti and the Repin Museum on the Volga commemorate this visit). When he returned to Saint Petersburg, the quality of his Volga boatmen drawings won him a commission from Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich for a large scale painting on the subject. The painting, &quot;Barge Haulers on the Volga&quot; was completed in 1873. The following year he was awarded a gold medal first-class for his painting &quot;The Resurrection of the Daughter of Jairus&quot;

In May 1872 he married Vera Alexeievna Shevtsova. (1855-1917). She joined him on his travels, including a trip to Samara, where their first child, Vera, was born. They had three other children; Nadia, Yuri, and Tatyana. The marriage was difficult, as Repin had numerous affairs, while Vera cared for the children. They were married for fifteen years.

In an 1872 letter to Stasov, Repin wrote: &quot;Now it is the peasant who is the judge and so it is necessary to represent his interests. (That is just the thing for me, since I am myself, as you know, a peasant, the son of a retired soldier who served twenty-seven hard years in Nicholas I&#x27;s army.)&quot; In 1873 Repin traveled to Italy and France with his family. His second daughter, Nadezhda, was born in 1874.

=== Paris and Normandy ===

Repin&#x27;s painting &quot;Barge Haulers of the Volga&quot;, shown at the Vienna International Exposition, brought him his first International attention. It also earned him a grant from the Academy of Fine Arts which allowed him to make an extended tour of several months to Austria, then Italy, and finally in 1873, to Paris. He rented an apartment in Montmartre at 13 rue Veron, and a small attic studio under a mansard roof at number 31 on the same street.

He remained in Paris for two years. He described his subjects as &quot;the principal types of Parisians, in the most typical settings.&quot; He painted the street markets and boulevards of Paris, and especially the varied faces and costumes of the Parisians of every class. His major Russian work created in Paris was &quot;Sadko&quot; (1876), a mystical allegory of an undersea kingdom, which included elements of Art Nouveau. He gave the young heroine a Russian face, surrounded by a strange and exotic setting. He wrote to his friend the civic Stasov: &quot;This idea describes my present situation, and perhaps, the situation of all of our Russian art&quot;. In 1876, His Sadko painting won him a place in the Russian Academy of Fine Arts.

He was in Paris in April 1874, when the First Impressionist Exhibition was held. In 1875, he wrote to Stasov about &quot;The liberty of the &quot;impressionalists&quot;, Manet, Monet et the others, and their infantile truthfulness.&quot; In 1876 He painted a portrait of his wife Vera in the exact style of Berthe Morisot&#x27;s portrait by Édouard Manet. as a tribute to Manet and Morisot. Though he admired some impressionist techniques, especially their depictions of light and color, he felt their work lacked moral or social purpose, key factors in his own art.

Following the ideas of the Impressionists, he spent two months at Veules-les-Roses in Normandy, painting landscapes in the open air. In 1874–1876 he contributed to the Salon in Paris. In 1876 he wrote to the secretary of the Russian academy of arts: &quot;You told me not to become &quot;Francified.&quot; What are you saying? I dream only of returning to Russia and working seriously. But Paris was of great utility to me, it can&#x27;t be denied.&quot;

=== Moscow and &quot;The Wanderers&quot; (1876–1885) ===

Repin returned to Russia in 1876. His son Yury was born the following year. He moved to Moscow that year, and produced a wide variety of works including portraits of the painters Arkhip Kuindzhi and Ivan Shishkin. He became involved with the &quot;Wanderers&quot;, an artistic movement founded in St. Petersburg in 1863. The style of the Wanderers was resolutely realistic, patriotic, and politically engaged, determined to break with classical models and to create a specifically Russian art. It involved not only painters, but sculptors, writers and composers.

Repin created a series of major historical works, including the Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate (1883), which was presented at the 12th annual exposition of the Wanderers. It was notable both for its extraordinary crowd of realistic figures, including surly policemen, weary monks, children and beggars, each expressing a vivid personality. He also experimented with outdoor sunlight effects, apparently influenced by the impressionists and his outdoor studies in France. His next major work of this period was Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan. This painting, depicting the tsar, his face full of horror, just after he has killed his son with his sceptre in a demented rage. It caused a scandal. Some critics saw it as a veiled criticism of Tsar Alexander III, who had brutally suppressed the opposition after a failed assassination attempt. It was also attacked by the more aesthetic faction of the Wanderers, who considered it overly sensationalist. It was vandalised twice and was finally, at the tsar&#x27;s request, removed from view. The tsar reconsidered his decision, and the painting was finally put back on view.

The portrait of the Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna is one of his most tragic historical works. It depicts The daughter of Tsar Alexis who became regent of Russia after the death of her father, but then was deposed from power in 1689 and locked away in a convent by her half-brother, Peter the Great. The painting captures her fury as she realises her future life.

&quot;They Did Not Expect Him&quot;. (1884-1888),(Tretyakov Gallery) is a notable and subtle historical work of the period, depicting a young man, a former &quot;narodniki&quot; or revolutionary, emaciated and frail from prison and exile, returning unexpectedly to his family. The story is told by the different expressions on the faces of his family and small details, such as the portraits of Tsar Alexander III and of favourite Russian poets on the wall.

=== Repin and Tolstoy ===

In 1880 Lev Tolstoy came to Repin&#x27;s small studio on Bolshoi Trubny street in Moscow to introduce himself. This developed into a friendship between the 36-year-old painter and the 52-year-old writer that lasted thirty years until Tolstoy&#x27;s death in 1910. Repin regularly visited Tolstoy at his Moscow residence, and his country estate at Yasnaya Polyana. He painted a series of portraits of Tolstoy in peasant dress, working and reading under a tree at Yasnaya Polyana. Tolstoy wrote of an 1887 visit by Repin: &quot;Repin came to see me and painted a fine portrait. I appreciate him more and more; he is lively person, approaching the light to which all of us aspire, including us poor sinners.&quot; His last trip to see Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana was in 1907, when Tolstoy was 79. Despite his age, Tolstoy went horseback riding with Repin, ploughed fields, cleared paths of brush and hiked through the countryside for nine hours, all the while discussing philosophy and morals. Repin&#x27;s portraits of Tolstoy in country dress were widely exhibited, and helped build Tolstoy&#x27;s legendary image.

=== Repin and Russian composers ===

In addition to his portraits of Tolstoy and Russian writers, Repin painted portraits of the major Russian composers of his time, His images, like his paintings of Tolstoy and other writers, became an integral part of the image of these composers. His portrait of Modest Moussorgsky was particularly famous. The composer suffered from alcoholism and depression. Repin painted him in four sittings, beginning four days before his death. When Moussorgsky died, Repin used the proceeds of the sale of the painting to erect a monument to the composer.

His portrait of Mikhail Glinka, composer of the opera &quot;Ruslan and Ludmilla&quot; (1887) was an unusual work for Repin. it was painted after Glinka&#x27;s death; Repin never met him, and based on drawings and recollections of others. Other composers painted by Repin included Alexander Glazunov who had just completed Borodin&#x27;s opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, and Anton Rubinstein the founder of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory of Music.

His third daughter, Tatyana, was born in 1880. He frequented the art circle of Savva Mamontov, which gathered at Abramtsevo, his estate near Moscow. Here Repin met many of the leading painters of the day, including Vasily Polenov, Valentin Serov, and Mikhail Vrubel. In 1882 he and Vera divorced; they maintained a friendly relationship afterwards.

Repin&#x27;s contemporaries often commented on his special ability of capturing peasant life in his works. In an 1876 letter to Stasov, Kramskoi wrote: &quot;Repin is capable of depicting the Russian peasant exactly as he is. I know many artists who have painted peasants, some of them very well, but none of them ever came close to what Repin does.&quot; Leo Tolstoy later stated that Repin &quot;depicts the life of the people much better than any other Russian artist.&quot; He was praised for his ability to reproduce human life with powerful and vivid force.

=== &quot;Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks&quot;===

In 1883 he traveled around Western Europe with Vladimir Stasov. Repin&#x27;s painting &quot;Religious Procession in Kursk Province&quot; was shown at the eleventh Itinerants&#x27; Society Exhibition. In that year he painted &quot;The wall of Pere Lachaise Cemetery commemorating the Paris Commune&quot;. In 1886, he traveled to the Crimea with Arkhip Kuinji, and produced drawings and sketches on Biblical subjects.

In 1887 he visited Austria, Italy, and Germany, and retired from the board of the Wanderers, painted two portraits of Leo Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana and painted &quot;Alexander Pushkin on the Shore of the Black Sea&quot; (in collaboration with Ivan Aivazovsky). In 1888 he traveled to Southern Russia and the Caucasus, where he did sketches and studies of descendants of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.

Many of Repin&#x27;s finest portraits were produced in the 1880s. Through the presentation of real faces, these portraits express the rich, tragical, and hopeful spirit of the period. His portraits of Aleksey Pisemsky (1880), Modest Mussorgsky (1881), and others created throughout the decade have become familiar to whole generations of Russians. Each is completely lifelike, conveying the transient, changeable nature of the sitter&#x27;s state of mind. They give an intense embodiment of both the physical and spiritual life of the people who sat for him.

In 1887 he was separated from his wife Vera. He visited Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana, and painted his portrait, and then took a long trip along the Volga and the Don, to the Cossack regions. This trip gave him material for his most famous historical work, &quot;Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks&quot;. The painting depicts an apocryphal event in 1678, when a group of cossacks supposedly amused themselves by drafting a highly insulting letter to the Turkish sultan, addressing him as &quot;The Grand Imbecile&quot;. Repin worked on this painting periodically between 1880 and 1891, creating an extraordinary ensemble of expressive faces. Most of the models were faculty members from the Academy of Arts, and had a variety of nationalities, including Russians, Ukrainians, a Cossack student, Greeks, and Poles. The cossack in a blue hat in the center is Mikhail Dragomirov, a General in the Russian army. The Cossack with a yellow hat, at the top right and almost hidden by Taras Bulba, is Fyodor Stravinsky, an opera singer with the Mariinsky Theatre, of Polish descent, and the father of the composer Igor Stravinsky. The finished work was so popular that he painted a second version.
In 1890 he was given a government commission to work on the creation of a new statute for the Academy of Arts. In 1891 he resigned from the Wanderers in protest against a new statute that restricted the rights of young artists. An exhibition of works by Repin and Shishkin was held in the Academy of Arts, including &quot;Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks&quot;. In 1892 he held a one-man exhibition at the History Museum in Moscow. In 1893 he visited academic art schools in Warsaw, Kraków, Munich, Vienna, and Paris to observe and study teaching methods. He spent the winter in Italy and published his essays &quot;Letters on Art&quot;.

In 1894 he began teaching a class at the Higher Art School attached to the Academy of Arts, a position he held, off and on, until 1907. In 1895 he painted portraits of Emperor Nicholas II, and Princess Maria Tenisheva. In 1896 he attended the All-Russian Exhibition in Nizhni Novgorod. His paintings were exhibited in Saint Petersburg, at the Exhibition of Works of Creative Art. His paintings from this year included &quot;The Duel&quot; and &quot;Don Juan and Dona Anna&quot;. In 1897 he rejoined the Wanderers, and was appointed rector of the Higher Artistic School for a year. In 1898 he traveled to the Holy Land, and painted the icon &quot;Carrying the Cross&quot; for the Russian Orthodox Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Jerusalem. After returning to Russia, he attended Pavel Tretyakov&#x27;s funeral. In 1899 he joined the editorial board of the magazine &quot;World of Art&quot;, but soon quit.

=== Move to Finland (1890) ===
In 1890 Repin met Natalia Nordman (1863-1914), who became his common-law wife. She was the daughter of an admiral, a writer and feminist, an activist for the improvement of working conditions. She advocated a simple life close to nature. In 1899 he acquired land near a village of Kuokkala, about forty kilometres north of St. Petersburg, and they built a country house, called the Penates, which became his home for the next thirty years. It was located in the Grand Duchy of Finland, then part of the Russian Empire, about an hour by train from St. Petersburg. At first he used it only as a summer house, but after he resigned from the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts in 1907, it became his full-time home and studio. 
It was a rather eccentric estate, including a studio covered with a pyramidal lantern roof, a landscape garden with a &quot;Pushkin alley&quot; of trees, a multicoloured music kiosk in the Egyptian style, and a telescope overlooking the Gulf of Finland. He hosted vegetarian breakfasts for his guests (a practice he adapted from Tolstoy), and very elaborate receptions on Wednesdays. His Wednesday guests included the opera singer Chaliapin, the writer Maxim Gorky, the composer Alexander Glazunov the writer Aleksandr Kuprin; artists Vasily Polenov, Isaak Brodsky and Nicolai Fechin as well as poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, philosopher Vasily Rozanov and scientist Vladimir Bekhterev.
In 1900 he took Nordman to the World Exhibition in Paris, where he served as a painting judge. They visited Munich, the Tyrol, and Prague, His painting &quot;Get Thee Behind Me, Satan!&quot; was shown at the 29th Exhibition of the Wanderers. In 1901 he received from the Tsar one of his largest commissions, portraits of all sixty members of State Council. He proceeded with the help of photographs and the aid of two of his students. One of the subjects was Alexander Kerensky, the Russian president before the Bolshevik seizure of power. In addition to his government commissions, he found time for a light work on an entirely different theme; a painting in 1902–1903 called &quot;What Freedom!&quot; depicting two students dancing in the waves at the beach after completing their examinations.

=== Revolution and disillusion (1900–1905) ===

The repression of popular demonstrations in front of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg in 1905 disillusioned Repin. He called 1905 &quot;the year of disaster and shame&quot;. He resigned from his teaching post at the Academy of Fine Arts, and concentrated on painting. The movements toward democracy in the early 20th century inspired Repin, he joined the Constitutional Democratic Party, was offered the rank of Councillor of State, and was invited to take a seat in the Duma, the national assembly. He made a colourful painting of the celebration of the new Russian Constitution of 1905. Later, he painted the portrait of the newly-elected Russian President, Alexander Kerensky.

Repin concentrated on writing his memoirs, which he finished in 1915. He visited St. Peterburg to see expositions, including a 1909 show of works by the modernist Kandinsky. Repin was not impressed; he described it as &quot;the swamps of artistic corruption&quot;.

In 1900 he took his common-law wife Natalia Nordman to the World Exhibition in Paris, where he served as a painting judge. He visited Munich, the Tyrol, and Prague, and painted &quot;Natalia Nordman in a Tyrolese Hat&quot; and &quot;In the Sunlight: Portrait of Nadezhda Repina&quot;. In 1901 he was awarded the Legion of Honor. His painting &quot;Get Thee Behind Me, Satan!&quot; was shown at the 29th Itinerants&#x27; Society Exhibition. In 1902–1903 his works included the paintings &quot;Ceremonial Meeting of the State Council&quot; and &quot;What a Freedom!&quot;, over forty portrait studies, and portraits of Sergei Witte and Vyacheslav von Plehve. 

In 1904 he gave a speech at a memorial gathering for the artist Vasily Vereshchagin. He painted a portrait of the writer Leonid Andreyev and his work &quot;The Death of the Cossack Squadron Commander Zinovyev&quot;. He made sketches depicting government troops opening fire on a peaceful demonstration on 9 December 1905. During 1905 Repin participated in many protests
against bloodshed and Tsarist repressions, and tried to convey his impressions of these emotionally and politically charged events in his paintings.

He also did sketches for portraits of Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Stasov and two portraits of Natalia Nordman. In 1907 he resigned from the Academy of Arts, visited Chuguyev and the Crimea, and wrote reminiscences of Vladimir Stasov. In 1908 he publicly denounced capital punishment in Russia. He illustrated Leonid Andreyev&#x27;s story &quot;The Seven Who Were Hanged&quot;, and his painting &quot;The Cossacks from the Black Sea Coast&quot; was exhibited at the Itinerants&#x27; Society Exhibition. In 1909 he painted &quot;Gogol Burning the Manuscript of the Second Part of Dead Souls&quot;, and in 1910, portraits of Pyotr Stolypin, and the children&#x27;s writer and poet Korney Chukovsky.

=== War, the Bolshevik Revolution and later years (1917–1930) ===

The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 brought a series of setbacks and tragedies to Repin. His wife became ill with tuberculosis, and departed for treatment in Locarno, Switzerland. She refused assistance from her family and died in Switzerland in 1914. Then, following the October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Finland, including the Penates, declared its independence from Russia. The border was closed, and Repin refused to return to Russia. He turned to Finland for new clients, painting a large group portrait of notable Finnish leaders and artists, including the architect Eliel Saarinen, the composer Jean Sibelius, and the future Finnish President Carl Gustav Mannerheim. Repin included the back of his own head in the painting.

In 1916, Repin worked on his book of reminiscences, &quot;Far and Near&quot;, with the assistance of Korney Chukovsky. He welcomed the early phases of the Russian Revolution, namely the February Revolution of February 1917. However, he was hostile to the Bolsheviks and was appalled by their rise to power in the October Revolution and the violence and terror they unleashed thereafter. In 1919. he donated his collection of works by Russian artists and his own works to the Finnish National Gallery in Helsinki, and in 1920 honorary celebrations of Repin were held by artistic circles in Finland. In 1921–1922 he painted &quot;The Ascent of Elijah the Prophet&quot; and &quot;Christ and Mary Magdalene (The Morning of the Resurrection)&quot;.

Repin was so hostile to the new Soviet regime, that he even lashed out at their spelling &quot;reform&quot;. Specifically, he objected to writing his last name &quot;Рѣпинъ&quot; (&quot;Riepin&quot;) under the new rules, which made it &quot;Репин&quot;, as the elimination of ѣ led many people to incorrectly spell his name as &quot;Ryopin&quot;.

After end of the war in 1918, Repin could travel again. In 1923, Repin held a one-man exhibition in Prague. Celebrations were given in 1924 in Kuokkala to mark Repin&#x27;s 80th birthday, and an exhibition of his works was held in Moscow. In 1925, a jubilee exhibition of his works was held in the Russian Museum in Leningrad (renamed St Petersburg-Petrograd). The rising Soviet dictator, Joseph Stalin, sent a delegation of Soviet artists, including a former student of Repin, Isaak Brodsky, to persuade Repin to return to St. Petersburg, and to give up his residence in Finland. But Repin did not want to be under the thumb of Stalin, and refused, though he donated three sketches devoted to the Revolution of 1905 and the portrait of Alexander Kerensky to the Museum of the Revolution of 1905. In 1928–29, still in Finland, he continued working on the painting &quot;The Hopak Dance&quot; (&quot;The Zaporozhye Cossacks Dancing&quot;), begun in 1926, which was his final work. It portrays Repin&#x27;s admiration of Ukraine and its culture. Repin painted it with oil on linoleum, because he could not get a canvas large enough.

Repin died in 1930, and was buried at the Penates. After the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939, the territory of Kuokkala was annexed by the USSR. In 1948, despite Repin&#x27;s hostility towards Bolshevism, it was renamed Repino in his honor. The Penates became a museum in 1940, and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Portraits ==

Repin particularly excelled at portrait painting. He produced more than three hundred portraits in his career. He painted most of the notable political figures, writers and composers of his time. One exception was Dostoevsky, whose mysticism Repin did not appreciate at all. He preceded each portrait with six or seven sketches. He had to persuade a reluctant Tolstoy to be portrayed working in a field with bare feet, as he usually did.

Repin persistently searched for new techniques and content to give his work more fullness and depth. Repin had a set of favorite subjects, and a limited circle of people whose portraits he painted. But he had a deep sense of purpose in his aesthetics, and had the great artistic gift to sense the spirit of the age and its reflection in the lives and characters of individuals. Repin&#x27;s search for truth and for an ideal led him in various directions artistically, influenced by hidden aspects of social and spiritual experiences as well as national culture. Like most Russian realists of his times, Repin often based his works on dramatic conflicts, drawn from contemporary life or history. He also used mythological images with a strong sense of purpose; some of his religious paintings are among his greatest.

== Drawings and sketches ==
With some of his paintings, Repin made one hundred or more preliminary sketches. He began his works with sketches in pencil or charcoal, using lines and cross-hatching. Often he would rub the drawing with his finger or an eraser to get the precise shading that he desired. He sometimes used drawings or paintings of his children to experiment with different points of view. For his large paintings, he made very detailed studies, experimenting with the composition and judging the overall impression.

== Genre painting ==

No Russian painter of the 19th or 20th century was more skilled at genre painting, portraying scenes of daily life in a sympathetic and perceptive way, giving each character a distinct purpose and personality. His works ranged from domestic scenes to small dramas, such as policemen arresting a young militant for distributing revolutionary tracts.

==Repin and Ukraine ==

In the 1870s to 1880s he visited Chuguyev and gathered materials for his future works. There, he painted his &quot;Archdeacon&quot;.

Paintings of Repin inspired by Ukrainian culture include:

The Repin Museum in his birthplace of Chuhuiv presents objects and works from his early life in Ukraine.

* &quot;Man with a bad eye&quot; (1876)
* &quot;Ukrainian girl by the fence&quot; (1876)
* &quot;Mohnachi village near Chuguyev&quot; (1877)
* &quot;Portret of M. Murashko&quot; (1877)
* &quot;Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks&quot; (1880–1891, two versions: St. Petersburg, and Kharkiv)
* &quot;Vechornytsi&quot; (1881)
* &quot;Ukrainian village woman&quot; (1886)
* &quot;Taras Shevchenko&#x27;s portrait&quot; (1888)
* &quot;Haydamaka&quot; (1902)
* &quot;Cossacks on the Black Sea&quot; (1908)
* &quot;Prometheus&quot; (1910, after T. Shevchenko&#x27;s poem)
* &quot;Hopak&quot; (1930)

Repin was a member of the committee, set up to create a monument to painter-poet Taras Shevchenko whom he called an &quot;apostle of freedom&quot;. He illustrated novels such as &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; and &quot;Sorochinsky Fair&quot; by Nikolai Gogol (1872–82) and &quot;Zaporissya in the remains of ancient legends and people&quot; by Dmytro Yavornytsky (1887), and drew numerous sketches of architecture as well as different popular aspects of Ukrainian culture. Repin&#x27;s sphere of knowledge included a number of prominent thinkers of the time, including Marko Kropyvnytskyi, Mykola Murashko, and Dmytro Yavornytsky.

Repin helped the committee of the Visual Arts Union in Mykolaiv. He was also an honorary member of Literature and Art Union, as well as Union of the Antiquities and Art in Kiev. He supported numerous painters, Murashko&#x27;s art schools in Kiev, M. Rajevska-Ivanova in Kharkiv, and the Art school in Odessa.

In one of his last letters he wrote: &quot;kind, dear compatriots [...] I ask you to believe in the sense of my devotion and endless regret that I can&#x27;t move to live in a sweet, joyful Ukraine [...] Loving you from the childhood, Ilya Repin&quot;. The painter was buried by the &quot;Chuguyev&#x27;s hill&quot;, a place at the end of his property in Penates.

==Style and technique ==

Repin persistently searched for new techniques and content to give his work more fullness and depth. Repin had a set of favorite subjects, and a limited circle of people whose portraits he painted. But he had a deep sense of purpose in his aesthetics, and had the great artistic gift to sense the spirit of the age and its reflection in the lives and characters of individuals. Repin&#x27;s search for truth and for an ideal led him in various directions artistically, influenced by hidden aspects of social and spiritual experiences as well as national culture. Like most Russian realists of his times, Repin often based his works on dramatic conflicts, drawn from contemporary life or history. He also used mythological images with a strong sense of purpose; some of his religious paintings are among his greatest.

His method was the reverse of the general approach of impressionism. He produced works slowly and carefully. They were the result of close and detailed study. He was never satisfied with his works, and often painted multiple versions, years apart. He also changed and adjusted his methods constantly in order to obtain more effective arrangement, grouping and coloristic power. Repin&#x27;s style of portraiture was unique, but owed something to the influence of Édouard Manet and Diego Velázquez.

==Legacy==
Repin was the first Russian artist to achieve European fame using specifically Russian themes. His 1873 painting &quot;Barge Haulers on the Volga&quot;, radically different from previous Russian paintings, made him the leader of a new movement of critical realism in Russian art. He chose nature and character over academic formalism. The triumph of this work was widespread, and it was praised by contemporaries like Vladimir Stasov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The paintings show his feeling of personal responsibility for the hard life of the common people and the destiny of Russia.

On 5 August 2009, Google celebrated Ilya Repin&#x27;s Birthday with a doodle.

In a 2017 VTsIOM poll, Repin ranked third as the most favorite artist of Russians, with 16% of respondents naming him as their favorite, behind Ivan Aivazovsky (27%) and Ivan Shishkin (26%).

Smith’s spacewalk time places him in 14th on the all-time American and World spacewalk duration lists.

==Education==
Attended Bret Harte Middle School in San Jose, California and graduated from Leland High School, San Jose, California, in 1977; received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1981; a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1982; and a master’s degree in business administration in 1987. All three degrees are from Stanford University.

==Awards and honors==
NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, NASA Space Flight Medal, NASA Exceptional Service Medal, IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, IBM Outstanding Community Service Award. Seven-time high school and collegiate All-American in swimming and water polo. Two-time National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Champion at Stanford in water polo. Captain of the 1980 NCAA Championship team. Former Board Member of Special Olympics Texas.

==Career with IBM==
Steve Smith worked for IBM in the Large Scale Integration (semiconductor) Technology Group in San Jose as a technical group lead from 1982 until 1985. Following a leave to pursue graduate studies, Smith returned to IBM’s Hardware and Systems Management Group as a product manager until 1989.

== Volunteerism ==
Smith is a member of the National Advisory Board for the Positive Coaching Alliance, a nonprofit which provides training workshops to coaches, parents, and sports administrators of schools and youth sports organizations. He did a 1-on-1 interview with them called &quot;Astronaut Steve Smith: How Youth Sports Took Him To The Outer Limits&quot;.

From 2000-2003 Smith was the director of Special Olympics Texas. This followed Smith winning the 1998 Outstanding Service from a Community Leader Award.

==NASA career==
Smith joined NASA in 1989 as a payload officer responsible for preflight payload integration and real-time flight controller support for Mission Control in the Mission Operations Directorate. After being selected to be an astronaut candidate in 1992, Smith went through a year of astronaut candidate training, and in September 1993, he became the first member of the 1992 astronaut class to receive a flight assignment.

He served as the Astronaut Office representative for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, the solid rocket boosters, the external tank, and shuttle safety. Smith was also assigned to duties at the Kennedy Space Center for a year and a half as a member of the astronaut support team. The team was responsible for space shuttle prelaunch vehicle checkout, crew ingress and strap-in prior to launch, and crew egress post landing. After STS-103, he served as the Deputy Chief Astronaut for a year. Smith completed an assignment serving as the NASA Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) Launch Package Manager for the ISS Program, and currently serves as the NASA International Space Station Program Liaison to the European Space Agency.

Steve Smith is a veteran of four space flights covering 16 million miles and seven spacewalks totaling 49 hours and 25 minutes. Smith’s spacewalk time places him in the top five on the all-time American and World spacewalk duration lists.

===STS-68===
Smith served as a mission specialist aboard the mission STS-68 in September 1994. Smith’s responsibilities were split between shuttle systems and Space Radar Lab 2 (SRL-2, the flight’s primary payload). Smith was one of two crewmen trained to perform a spacewalk had one been required. &quot;Endeavour&quot; circled the Earth 183 times and traveled 4.7 million miles during the 11-day flight.

===STS-82===
Smith performed three spacewalks as a member of the February 1997 mission, STS-82, which serviced the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The crew completed five spacewalks in order to improve the scientific capability of the telescope and to replace degraded equipment. The flight orbited the Earth 150 times covering 4.1 million miles during the 10-day flight.

===STS-103===

Smith returned to the Hubble Space Telescope and performed two spacewalks as the payload commander for the &quot;Discovery&quot; mission, STS-103 in December 1999. The crew performed three spacewalks to return Hubble to science operations with several upgraded subsystems. STS-103 orbited the Earth 120 times covering 3.2 million miles in just under 8 days.

===STS-110===
As the lead spacewalker of the April 2002 STS-110 crew which installed the S0 Truss Truss on the International Space Station, Smith performed two of the flight’s four spacewalks. The crew spent a week in joint operations with the station’s Expedition 4 crew. The STS-110 mission covered 4.5 million miles during 171 orbits in just under 11 days.

===Subsequent NASA roles===
Smith served as the NASA International Space Station (ISS) Program Liaison to the European Space Agency until mid-2015, after which he
went to serve as the Associate Director for ISS, Science Directorate, at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.

== Post-NASA career ==
Since retiring from NASA, Smith is a Keynote Speaker, giving talks for companies like IBM and LinkedIn. His speech topics include &quot;Lessons from Space to Enhance Your Life and Work&quot;, &quot;Leadership at 17500 Miles Per Hour&quot;, and &quot;An Astronaut&#x27;s Journey: Dreams, Resilience, and Earth&#x27;s Beauty.&quot;

Smith has also joined several boards, including that of The Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation and the Blue Sky Network.

<text>Tilman Riemenschneider ( 1460 – 7 July 1531) was a German woodcarver and sculptor active in Würzburg from 1483. He was one of the most prolific and versatile sculptors of the transition period between the Late Gothic, to which he essentially belonged, and Northern Renaissance art, a master in limewood and stone. He was also a local politician in the council of Würzburg.

Most of his subjects are religious, including several very large and spectacular carved wood altarpieces, as well as tombs in stone, and statues. He was largely forgotten soon after his death, but rediscoved by art historians in the 19th century. 

==Biography==

Tilman Riemenschneider was born around the year 1460 at Heiligenstadt im Eichsfeld in present-day Thuringia.

When Riemenschneider was about five years old, his father was involved in a violent political conflict, the , so the family had to leave Heiligenstadt and all their possessions. They resettled in Osterode, where his father became Master of the Mint (a good position at that time) and where Riemenschneider spent his childhood years.

Riemenschneider likely came to Würzburg for the first time at the age of 18 in 1478/79. His uncle served as notary and financial advisor to the bishop there, but he did not stay for long. Around 1473, Riemenschneider learned the trade of sculpting and woodcarving, likely in Swabia or the Upper Rhine — possibly in Strasbourg and/or Ulm. At that time, the statutes of the guild required that an apprentice travel to many different workshops to gain experience. Very little is known about this period of his life, but he likely came in contact with the work of Martin Schongauer, whose copper engravings served him later as examples.

In 1483, he settled in Würzburg. On 7 December 1483, he joined the Saint Luke&#x27;s Guild of painters, sculptors, and glass workers as a painter&#x27;s assistant. On 28 February 1485, he married Anna Schmidt (born Uchenhofer), a widow of a master goldsmith with three sons. This marriage not only brought him property, but it also meant that he could end his apprenticeship and become a master craftsman.

Also in 1485, Riemenschneider became a citizen of Würzburg, which made it possible to attain the status of master craftsman, and opened a workshop in Franziskanergasse, in the home of his wife.

His earliest confirmed work is the gravestone of Eberhard von Grumbach in the parish church (&#x27;) at Rimpar. This may be the type of work he started out with before obtaining large church commissions. He then received numerous orders from the town councils of Würzburg and neighboring towns. The earliest large work attributed to him is the &quot;Franziskusaltar&quot; in the church of St James (&#x27;) in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, which is described in the church guide book as &quot;about 1490&quot;, but its style compared to other works of that date is rather primitive, suggesting it may be an earlier work, sometimes dated from 1485. In 1490, the town council of Münnerstadt ordered an retable for the altar of &quot;St Mary Magdalene&quot;, the parish church, which included a carving of Mary Magdalene with six angels. It was set up in 1492. In 1491, the town council of Würzburg ordered two life-sized stone figures of &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; for the south portal of the council&#x27;s church, the &quot;Marienkapelle&quot; (erected in 1493).

In 1494, Riemenschneider&#x27;s first wife died, leaving him with three stepsons and a daughter. In keeping with the times and his status, he remarried Anna Rappolt in 1497. They had two daughters and three sons, all of whom seem to have inherited their father&#x27;s artistic talent. In 1495, he created a statue of &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; for the parrish church of St Bernard, Würzburg).

More high-profile work followed: In 1496 Riemenschneider received the commission by Prince-Bishop at Würzburg Cathedral Lorenz von Bibra to carve the epitaph for his predecessor Rudolf von Scherenberg. It was erected in 1499, the same year he got the commission for the Imperial tomb of Henry II and his wife Cunigunde of Luxembourg at Bamberg Cathedral (delivered 1513).

By 1500, he had developed an outstanding reputation as an artist and had become a wealthy Würzburg citizen. Not only did he own a number of houses, but he also was a landowner with his own vineyards. His flourishing workshop is estimated to have provided work for as many as 40 employees. Between 1501 and 1517 he had twelve apprentices registered, more than any other in Würzburg, and in 1508 he stated three stone sculptors would work for him. For that timespan alone at least a dozen retables are known to have been made by Riemenschneider&#x27;s workshop. 

In November 1504, Riemenschneider became a member of the sub-council (&quot;&quot;) of the town of Würzburg, an office he held until 1525. This office not only brought him social status, but it also helped him obtain many large and profitable commissions.

In 1508, Riemenschneider married Margaretha Wurzbach. From 1509 until 1522 he was a member of the &quot;Oberrat&quot; four times. He married again, in 1520, a woman of whom only the first name, Margarethe, is known. In 1520/1, Riemenschneider was one of two mayors of Würzburg.

His increasing engagement in local politics at a time of heavy order volume meant that his employees and apprentices took a more prominent role in the creation of the workshop&#x27;s output. Art historians have been able to identify specific figures as the work of individual workers.

During the German Peasants&#x27; War, Riemenschneider was one of the town council members who refused to obey an order by Konrad von Thüngen, the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg to fight the revolting peasants. On 4 June 1525, the peasant&#x27;s army was destroyed, with 8,000 killed, just outside Würzburg by the troops of Georg, Steward of Waldburg-Zeil, and the bishop. After the town surrendered, the full town council, including Riemenschneider, was incarcerated and tortured in Marienberg Fortress. The claim that both of his hands were broken during the torture, which ended his artistic career, is today considered to be a legend without base in fact. It probably only originated in the 19th century after his &quot;rediscovery&quot;. Together with the rest of the council, Tilman was set free after two months, with loss of most of his property. The only order he is known to have received after this was work in 1527 for a Benedictine nunnery at Kitzingen. Until his death on 7 July 1531 at Würzburg, he led a retired life with his fourth wife. His son Jörg from his second marriage continued the workshop after his death.

Due to his loss of status, Riemenschneider was soon forgotten as an artist, other than for the two epitaphs of Bishops Rudolf von Scherenberg and Lorenz von Bibra side by side in Würzburg Cathedral. Only when his gravestone was discovered in 1822 between Würzburg Cathedral and Neumünster was his outstanding position in Gothic sculpture recognized by a wider audience. Unlike Albrecht Dürer or Veit Stoss, Riemenschneider acquired true fame only posthumously.
== Art ==
The sculptures and woodcarvings of Tilman Riemenschneider are in the late Gothic style. Notably the tomb for Lorenz von Bibra (see below) is considered as one of the pieces marking the transition from Gothic to Renaissance art. Riemenschneider&#x27;s early success as a sculptor was due to the plasticity of his works, with great care being taken of modeling the folds of garments. This way of sculpting the clothing as well as the typical oval faces and almond-shaped eyes were modelled on art from the Upper Rhine region of the 1470s, implying that Riemenschneider may have learned his trade either there or at Ulm. Other traits of his style derive from his presumed apprenticeship in Thuringia, where he grew up. It is assumed he learned stone and alabaster carving first and only later turned to wood carving. Some wooden figures, though unmistakably his own work, show some signs of less-than-perfect choice of wood or handling.

His work is equally characterized by the expressiveness of the figurines&#x27; faces (often shown with an inward look, as in the presumed self-portrait). The emphasis on expression of inner emotions sets Riemenschneider&#x27;s work apart from that of his immediate predecessors, although his later work show mannerist characteristics, simplified forms with less volume that were easier to dublicate, and may be also a sign of restraint due to the upcoming iconoclasm.

Riemenschneider is seen today as one of the first sculptors of the 15th century who did not have all his figures painted. Prior to the 1490s, almost every sculpture had been polychromed and gilded, usually by a painter (so-called &quot;&quot;), which hightend the liveliness of the figures and attracted more admiration than the sculptural work itself. Curiously, Riemenschneider didn&#x27;t employ any painters like other sculptor&#x27;s workshops. Instead he worked regularly with painters who had their own business, like Jakob Mülholzer (cooperation verifiable from 1490/91–1514/15) und Martin Schwarz (lived c. 1460–1511). The reasons for shifting to a new type of art, where the wood remained visible, are still debated by art historians.

Souren Melikian places Riemenschneider&#x27;s best work, such as the &quot;Virgin listening to the Annunciation&quot;, in the same league as the oil paintings of Albrecht Dürer.Ref? Art historian Kenneth Clark views the Riemenschneider figures as showing the serious personal piety in Germany in the late fifteenth century and as harbingers of the coming Reformation.Ref? Among his successors and/or pupils –beside his sons– were and Philipp Koch.

==In literature==
The character Goldmund in the 1930 book &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot; by Hermann Hesse serves as an apprentice with a master sculptor who is socially prominent in the town where he worked and whose character appears to be loosely based on that of Riemenschneider. He serves both as an artistic inspiration for Goldmund and as a foil for the less restrained temperament of Goldmund. Hesse describes Riemenschneider&#x27;s statue of Mary with child which resides in the Pfarrkirche St Burkard in Würzburg as: &quot;Dreamily she gazes out from her glass case, far away from our world... in her gracefulness and distinction she is refined to a degree of perfection far above that of mankind today.&quot;

The plot of Elizabeth Peters&#x27;s first Vicky Bliss mystery novel, &quot;Borrower of the Night&quot; (1973) centers around the search for a missing Riemenschneider sculpture. Most of the action takes place in Rothenburg ob der Tauber.

<text>The Gerousia (γερουσία) was the council of elders in ancient Sparta. Sometimes called Spartan senate in the literature, it was made up of the two Spartan kings, plus 28 men over the age of sixty, known as gerontes. The Gerousia was a prestigious body, holding extensive judicial and legislative powers, which shaped Sparta&#x27;s policies. 

Ancient Greeks considered that the Gerousia was created by the mythical Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus in his Great Rhetra, the constitution of Sparta. 

The gerontes were elected through peculiar shouting elections, which were open to manipulation, especially from the kings. 

== Membership ==

The &quot;Gerousia&quot; consisted of thirty members in total. Twenty-eight elected members (called gerontes) and the two kings, who were members by right, entering the chamber upon their accession. Unlike the kings, the 28 gerontes had to be at least 60 years old—the age when Spartan citizens were no longer required to serve in the army. Membership of the Gerousia was for life, which made the gerontes&#x27; position very prestigious within Spartan society.

The electoral procedure is known thanks to Plutarch, who wrote in the 2nd century AD, but whose source was a lost study on the Spartan constitution by Aristotle. There were no ballots: the gerontes were elected by shouting. The candidates passed one by one before the Spartan citizens, who therefore shouted according to their preference. The loudness of the shouts was assessed by a jury confined into a windowless building, who then declared winner the candidate with the loudest shouts. Aristotle considered this system &quot;childish&quot;, probably because influential people (such as the kings) could easily manipulate the elections.

The gerontes were likely drawn from a limited aristocracy composed of only a few families, sometimes called the &quot;kaloi kagatoi&quot;. Modern scholars have debated since the 19th century on whether these families had a legal privilege on Gerousia membership, or just a &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly. Of the latter opinion, G. E. M. de Ste. Croix compared the situation in Sparta with that of Roman Republic, where a few &quot;gentes&quot; monopolised senior magistracies, notably thanks to their patronage network—a practice likely prevalent in Spartan politics.

As the kings were by right members of the Gerousia, they usually entered the chamber well before the age of sixty and served much longer terms than the ordinary gerontes, which they could use to build their influence there. Several shrewd kings, such as Cleomenes I or Agesilaus II, developed over the years such a network of supporters among the gerontes that they &quot;de facto&quot; controlled the Gerousia, therefore Sparta&#x27;s external and internal policies. This patronage of the gerontes by a king is illustrated by the story reported by Plutarch of Agesilaus II offering an ox and cloak to every new member of the Gerousia.

Paul Cartledge notes that when a king was absent, his nearest relative could cast a vote for him in the Gerousia, which means that at least two gerontes besides the kings were of royal stock (one for each dynasty) and further shows the influence that the kings had on the electoral procedure, as they could engineer the elections of their relatives.

The Gerousia was probably reformed by the king Cleomenes III (r.235–222), who made the gerontes elected annually. No longer elected for life, the source of the gerontes&#x27; prestige was removed and the Gerousia became a more pliable chamber as a result.

== Functions ==

=== Supreme court ===
The Gerousia served as the court in charge of capital cases. A king could even be prosecuted before a special court of 34 members, made of the Gerousia and the five ephors (the defendant king could not sit in the Gerousia during the trial). A famous case was the trial of king Pausanias in 403; accused of betrayal for having restored democracy in Athens, he was nonetheless acquitted by a 19-15 decision, in which the other king Agis II had cast his vote against him. Thanks to this judicial power, the gerontes were able to significantly influence foreign policy, although they had no constitutional power in that field, because the fear of prosecution before the Gerousia compelled Spartan officials to follow the gerontes&#x27; opinion. For example, in 371 the king Cleombrotus was advised by his friends to energetically wage war against Thebes to avoid a later trial.

=== &quot;Probouleusis&quot; ===
The Gerousia debated motions which were to be put before the citizen assembly, with the power to prevent any motion from being passed on. The Great Rhetra suggests that it had the power to overturn decisions made by the Spartan assembly.

== Legacy ==
The name Gerousia continued to be known in Laconia in the Deep or Mesa Mani known as the &quot;Gerontikoi&quot; until recent times.

In the Parliament of modern Greece, the name of the upper house was Gerousia between 1844–1864 and 1927–1935.

<doc id="658579" wikidata="Q423174" url="?curid=658579" title="Anthraquinone">
<text>Anthraquinone, also called anthracenedione or dioxoanthracene, is an aromatic organic compound with formula . Several isomers exist but these terms usually refer to 9,10-anthraquinone (IUPAC: 9,10-dioxoanthracene) wherein the keto groups are located on the central ring. It is used as a digester additive to wood pulp for papermaking. Many anthraquinone derivatives are generated by organisms or synthesised industrially for use as dyes, pharmaceuticals, and catalysts. Anthraquinone is a yellow, highly crystalline solid, poorly soluble in water but soluble in hot organic solvents. It is almost completely insoluble in ethanol near room temperature but 2.25 g will dissolve in 100 g of boiling ethanol. It is found in nature as the rare mineral hoelite.

==Synthesis==
There are several current industrial methods to produce 9,10-anthraquinone:
# The oxidation of anthracene. Chromium(VI) is the typical oxidant. 
# The Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzene and phthalic anhydride in presence of AlCl3. o-Benzoylbenzoic acid is an intermediate. This reaction is useful for producing substituted anthraquinones.
# The Diels-Alder reaction of naphthoquinone and butadiene followed by oxidative dehydrogenation.
# The acid-catalyzed dimerization of styrene to give a 1,3-diphenylbutene, which then can be transformed to the anthraquinone. This process was pioneered by BASF.

It also arises via the Rickert–Alder reaction, a retro-Diels–Alder reaction.

==Reactions==
Hydrogenation gives dihydroanthraquinone (anthrahydroquinone). Reduction with copper gives anthrone. Sulfonation with sulfuric acid gives anthroquinone-1-sulfonic acid, which reacts with sodium chlorate to give 1-chloroanthaquinone.

==Applications==
===Digester additive in papermaking===
9,10-Anthraquinone is used as a digester additive in production of paper pulp by alkaline processes, like the kraft, the alkaline sulfite or the Soda-AQ processes. The anthraquinone is a redox catalyst. The reaction mechanism may involve single electron transfer (SET). The anthraquinone oxidizes the reducing end of polysaccharides in the pulp, i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose, and thereby protecting it from alkaline degradation (peeling). The anthraquinone is reduced to 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene which then can react with lignin. The lignin is degraded and becomes more watersoluble and thereby more easy to wash away from the pulp, while the anthraquinone is regenerated. This process gives an increase in yield of pulp, typically 1–3% and a reduction in kappa number.

=== Hydrogen Peroxide Production ===
2-Alkyl-9,10-Anthroquinones are used as a catalyst in the Anthraquinone Process for the production of hydrogen peroxide. This process is the dominant industrial method of hydrogen peroxide production.

===Niche uses===
9,10-anthraquinone is used as a bird repellant on seeds, and as a gas generator in satellite balloons. It has also been mixed with lanolin and used as a wool spray to protect sheep flocks against kea attacks in New Zealand.

==Other isomers==
Several other isomers of anthraquinone exist, including the 1,2-, 1,4-, and 2,6-anthraquinones. They are of minor importance compared to 9,10-anthraquinone.

==Safety==
Anthraquinone has no recorded , probably because it is so insoluble in water.

In terms of metabolism of substituted anthraquinones, the enzyme encoded by the gene UGT1A8 has glucuronidase activity with many substrates including anthraquinones.

<doc id="658590" wikidata="Q838" url="?curid=658590" title="Andrei Rublev">
<text>Andrei Rublev (, ; – ) was a Russian artist considered to be one of the greatest medieval Russian painters of Orthodox Christian icons and frescoes. He is revered as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, and his feast day is 29 January.

==Early life==
Little information survives about his life; even where he was born is unknown. He probably lived in the Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra, near Moscow, under Nikon of Radonezh, who became hegumen after the death of Sergius of Radonezh in 1392. The first mention of Rublev is in 1405, when he decorated icons and frescos for the Cathedral of the Annunciation of the Moscow Kremlin, in company with Theophanes the Greek and Prokhor of Gorodets. His name was the last of the list of masters, as the junior both by rank and by age. Theophanes was an important Byzantine master, who moved to Russia and is considered to have trained Rublev.

==Career==
Chronicles tell us that together with Daniel Chorny he painted the Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir in 1408 as well as the Trinity Cathedral in the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius between 1425 and 1427. After Daniel&#x27;s death, Andrei came to Moscow&#x27;s Andronikov Monastery where he painted his last work, the frescoes of the Saviour Cathedral. He is also believed to have painted at least one of the miniatures in the Khitrovo Gospels.

The only work authenticated as entirely his is the icon of the Trinity (c. 1410), removed in 2023 from the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow to the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. It is based on an earlier icon known as the &quot;Hospitality of Abraham&quot; (illustrating ). Rublev removed the figures of Abraham and Sarah from the scene, and through a subtle use of composition and symbolism changed the subject to focus on the Mystery of the Trinity.

In Rublev&#x27;s art two traditions are combined: the highest asceticism and the classic harmony of Byzantine mannerism. The characters of his paintings are always peaceful and calm. After some time his art came to be perceived as the ideal of Eastern Church painting and of Orthodox iconography.

==Death and legacy==
Rublev died at Andronikov Monastery between 1427 and 1430. Rublev&#x27;s work influenced many artists including Dionisy. The Stoglavi Sobor (1551) promulgated Rublev&#x27;s icon style as a model for church painting. Since 1959, the Andrei Rublev Museum at the Andronikov Monastery has displayed his and related art.

The Russian Orthodox Church canonized Rublev as a saint in 1988, celebrating his feast day on 29 January and/or on 4 July.

In 1966, Andrei Tarkovsky made a film &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot;, loosely based on the artist&#x27;s life. This became the first (and perhaps only) film produced in the Soviet era to treat the artist as a world-historic figure and Christianity as an axiom of Russia&#x27;s historical identity, during a turbulent period in the history of Russia.

Historian Serge Aleksandrovich Zenkovsky wrote that the names of Andrei Rublev, Epiphanius the Wise, Sergius of Radonezh and Stephen of Perm &quot;signify the Russian spiritual and cultural revival of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;The wonderful icons and frescoes of Andrey Rublev offered a harmonious and colorful expression of the spirit of complete serenity and humility. For the Russian people these icons became the finest achievement of religious art and the highest expression of Russian spirituality&quot;.

== Veneration ==

<text>In computing, codice_1 (for clear screen) is a command used by the command-line interpreters codice_2 and codice_3 on DOS, Digital Research FlexOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows and ReactOS operating systems to clear the screen or console window of commands and any output generated by them. It does not clear the user&#x27;s history of commands, however.
The command is also available in the DEC RT-11 operating system, in the open-source MS-DOS emulator DOSBox and in the EFI shell. In other environments, such as Linux and Unix, the same functionality is provided by the codice_4 command.

==History==
The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 (1983) and later. While the ultimate origins of using the three-character string codice_1 as the command to clear the screen likely predate Microsoft&#x27;s use, this command was present before its MS-DOS usage, in the embedded ROM BASIC dialects Microsoft wrote for early 8-bit microcomputers (such as TRS-80 Color BASIC), where it served the same purpose. The MS-DOS dialects of BASIC written by Microsoft, BASICA and GW-BASIC, also have the codice_1 command as a BASIC keyword - as do various non-Microsoft implementations of BASIC such as Sinclair BASIC (1980), or BBC BASIC found on the BBC Micro computers (1981). The codice_1 command is also present in BASIC versions for Microsoft Windows, however this generally clears text printed on the form, rather than the whole window or controls on the form.

The command codice_1 has appeared as a clear screen command in many other BASIC dialects and command line interpreters, because of its familiarity through being included in MS-DOS.

The Software Link&#x27;s PC-MOS includes an implementation of codice_1. Like the rest of the operating system, it is licensed under the GPL v3.

DR DOS also includes an implementation of the command.

<doc id="658597" wikidata="Q312954" url="?curid=658597" title="Rudaki">
<text>Rudaki (also spelled Rodaki; ; – 940/41) was a poet, singer, and musician who is regarded as the first major poet to write in New Persian. A court poet under the Samanids, he reportedly composed more than 180,000 verses, yet only a small portion of his work has survived, most notably parts of his versification of the &quot;Kalila wa-Dimna&quot;, a collection of Indian fables.

Born in the village of Banoj (located in the present-day Rudak area), the most important part of Rudaki&#x27;s career was spent at the court of the Samanids. While biographical information connects him to the Samanid &quot;amir&quot; (ruler) Nasr II (), he may have already joined the court under the latter&#x27;s predecessor, Ahmad Samani ().

Rudaki&#x27;s success was largely due to the support of his primary patron, the vizier Abu&#x27;l-Fadl al-Bal&#x27;ami (died 940), who played an important role in the blooming of New Persian literature in the 10th-century. Following the downfall of Bal&#x27;ami in 937, Rudaki&#x27;s career deteriorated, eventually being dismissed from the court. He thereafter lived his last years in poverty, dying blind and alone in his hometown.

In Iran, Rudaki is acknowledged as the &quot;founder of New Persian poetry&quot; and in Tajikistan as the &quot;father of Tajik literature&quot;.

== Name ==
His full name was Abu Abd Allah Ja&#x27;far ibn Muhammad ibn Hakim ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Adam al-Rudhaki al-Sha&#x27;ir al-Samarqandi (). The proper transliteration of his name is , while is an arabicised form. Other transliterations include &quot;Rudagi&quot;, &quot;Rawdhagi&quot; and &quot;Rudhagi&quot;.

== Background ==
Little information is available about Rudaki&#x27;s life, much which has been reconstructed from his poems. He lived during the era of the Samanid Empire (819–999), under which New Persian literature began to develop and flourish. Of Persian stock, Rudaki was born in , in the village of Banoj (Panjrud), located in the Rudak area between Samarqand and Bukhara. Rudaki&#x27;s blindness is implied by the writings of early poets such as Daqiqi (died 977), Ferdowsi (died 1020/25), Abu Zura&#x27;ah al-Mu&#x27;ammari () and Nasir Khusraw (died after 1070). The historian Awfi (died 1242), even says that Rudaki was born blind, but this has been questioned by some modern scholars, due to the expressive picture of nature given by Rudaki in his writings.

Besides being a poet, Rudaki was also a singer and musician. Since the era of Sasanian Iran (224–651), poems were commonly carried out as songs used in music. Under the Sasanians, the official, religious and literary language was Middle Persian. Following the Muslim conquest of Iran, the language entered a new phase, known as New Persian. However, it is not descended from the literary form of Middle Persian (known as &quot;pārsīk&quot;, commonly called Pahlavi), which was spoken by the people of Fars and used in Zoroastrian religious writings. Instead, it is descended from the dialect spoken by the court of the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon and the northeastern Iranian region of Khurasan. During this period, New Persian was known as &quot;darī&quot; or &quot;parsī-i darī&quot;.

== Career ==

By the age of eight, Rudaki had reportedly memorized the Qur&#x27;an and was skilled in poetry. He was instructed on how to play the chang by a prominent musician named Abu&#x27;l-Abak Bakhtiar. In his early years, Rudaki became a popular figure due to his fine voice, skill with poetry and playing the chang. Surviving biographical information connects Rudaki with the Samanid &quot;amir&quot; (ruler) Nasr II () or with his vizier Abu&#x27;l-Fadl al-Bal&#x27;ami (died 940). However, according to literary scholar Sassan Tabatabai, Rudaki had apparently already joined the Samanid court under Nasr II&#x27;s father and predecessor Ahmad Samani (). Tabatabai states that this is proven in a poem by Rudaki, where he tries to comfort Ahmad Samani after the death of his father Ismail Samani in 907.

Rudaki&#x27;s career at the Samanid court is regarded as the most important part of his life. The role of a court poet was more than just entertaining others, and was an essential aspect of the Persian court. According to the first Sasanian king Ardashir I (), a poet was &quot;part of government and the means of strengthening rulership.&quot; Besides applauding the suzerain and his domain, a poet was also expected to give advice and moral guidance, which meant that Rudaki was most likely experienced in that field as well. Rudaki&#x27;s success was largely due to the support of his primary patron, Bal&#x27;ami. The latter played an important role in the blooming of Persian literature in the 10th century. Bal&#x27;ami regarded Rudaki as the best amongst Persian and Arab poets.

Rudaki was a close friend to his student Shahid Balkhi, a leading poet and scholar of the Samanid realm. Following Shahid Balkhi&#x27;s death in 936, Rudaki wrote an elegy for him. Rudaki&#x27;s career started to decline following the downfall of Bal&#x27;ami in 937. He soon fell out of favour with the &quot;amir&quot; and was dismissed from the court. Rudaki thereafter lived his last years in poverty, dying blind and alone in his hometown in 940 or 941.

The French Iranologist Gilbert Lazard considered Rudaki&#x27;s first successor to have been Abu-Shakur Balkhi, who composed many &quot;mathnavis&quot;, notably the &quot;Afarin-nama&quot;.

== Works ==

According to Asadi Tusi, the &quot;divan&quot; (collection of short poems) of Rudaki consisted of more than 180,000 verses, but most of it has been lost. What little remains of Rudaki&#x27;s writings, mostly single verses, can be found in Persian dictionaries, particularly the &quot;Lughat-i Furs&quot; of Asadi Tusi. A few complete poems have also survived, most notably a &quot;qasida&quot; (eulogy or ode) consisting of almost 100 verses quoted in the anonymous &quot;Tarikh-i Sistan&quot;. The &quot;qasida&quot; was dedicated to Abu Ja&#x27;far Ahmad ibn Muhammad, who ruled the region of Sistan as a Samanid governor from 923 to 963. In it, Rudaki calls Abu Ja&#x27;far an aristocrat of Sasanian ancestry and &quot;pride of Iran&quot;, thus indicating a sense of continuity in Iranian identity from the Sasanian to the Samanid period. For this poem, Abu Ja&#x27;far rewarded Rudaki with 10,000 dinars.

Rudaki&#x27;s best known work is his versification of the &quot;Kalila wa-Dimna&quot;, a collection of Indian fables. Nasr II had ordered Bal&#x27;ami to translate the book from Arabic to Persian, and then appointed &quot;interpreters&quot; to read it out loud, so that Rudaki, who was blind, could versify it. Only a few of the verses made by Rudaki have survived. Some of them have been identified in the &quot;Lughat-i Furs&quot;. Rudaki&#x27;s surviving poetry is generally easy for literate native Persian readers to understand despite variations in terminology, word forms, and phrase and sentence patterns.

Although Rudaki displayed pro-Isma&#x27;ili sympathies in his writings, his poetry is fully secular in nature. Islam was firmly established by the 10th century; however, Persians still remembered their deep-rooted Zoroastrian history. Rudaki was more prone to evoke ancient Iranian and Zoroastrian notions instead of Muslim ones. Some of Rudaki&#x27;s poems were written in the pre-Islamic &quot;andarz&quot; style, i.e., ethical teachings, friendly criticism and advice for correct behavior in both private and public. An example of Rudaki&#x27;s Zoroastrian roots can be seen in an excerpt where he is talking about his patron:

== Legacy and assessment ==
Rudaki is considered to have been the first major poet to write in New Persian. Although he was predated by other poets who wrote in New Persian, such as Abu Hafs Sughdi (died 902), most of their work has not survived. In Iran, Rudaki is acknowledged as the &quot;founder of New Persian poetry&quot; and in Tajikistan as the &quot;father of Tajik literature&quot;, both claims which according to the Iranologist Richard Foltz are not contradictory. Rudaki&#x27;s life is depicted in the 1957 film of &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Fate&quot;, written by Satim Ulugzade (died 1997). The following year, the latter wrote a play focused on Rudaki, entitled &quot;Rudaki&quot;, which was the first Tajik biographical drama.

The 1100th anniversary of Rudaki&#x27;s birth was commemorated by Iran and the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in 1958, who together held a conference which was joined by several eminent Iranian and Tajik academics. It was during this period that Rudaki&#x27;s burial place in Panjrud was discovered. The Soviet archaeologist and anthropologist Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov (died 1970) dug out and analyzed Rudaki&#x27;s remains, which he used to recreate the latter&#x27;s face on a sculpture. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Rudaki started to become a stronger representation of Tajik identity and also reinforced their ties to the rest of the Persian-speaking world.

According to Nile Green, Rudaki &quot;heralded a new era for Persian letters.&quot; The Iranologist Francois de Blois states that Rudaki &quot;was the most celebrated Persian poet prior to Ferdowsi.&quot; Following his death, Rudaki continued to remain a highly popular figure for around two centuries, until the Mongol period, where he became unpopular amongst the highly skilled poets of that time. However, he had not been forgotten, as demonstrated by the attribution of his name to the Pseudo-&quot;Diwan-i Rudaki&quot;, called &quot;one of the notorious literary frauds&quot; by de Blois. Scholars such as Hasan ibn Luft Allah al-Razi in the 17th century and Reza-Qoli Khan Hedayat in the 19th century easily recognized that the Pseudo-&quot;Diwan-i Rudaki&quot; was mostly composed of poems by Qatran Tabrizi (died after 1088), while the rest were already-known poems of Rudaki that had been mentioned in &quot;tadhkiras&quot; (biographical dictionaries).

During the 19th century, Rudaki experienced a resurgence in popularity along with other ancient Khurasani poets.

<doc id="658601" wikidata="Q240242" url="?curid=658601" title="DOSKEY">
<text>DOSKEY is a command for DOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows, and ReactOS that adds command history, macro functionality, and improved editing features to the command-line interpreters codice_1 and codice_2.

==History==
The command was included as a terminate-and-stay-resident program with MS-DOS and PC DOS versions 5 and later, then Windows 9x, and finally Windows 2000 and later.

In early 1989, functionality similar to codice_3 was introduced with DR-DOS 3.40 with its codice_4 CONFIG.SYS directive. This enabled a user-configurable console input history buffer and recall as well as pattern search functionality on the console driver level, that is, fully integrated into the operating system and transparent to running applications. In the summer of 1991, codice_3 was introduced in MS-DOS/PC DOS 5.0 in order to provide some of the same functionality. codice_3 also added a macro expansion facility, though special support was required before applications such as command line processors could take advantage of it. Starting with Novell DOS 7 in 1993, the macro capabilities were provided by an external codice_3 command as well. In order to also emulate the codice_3 history buffer functionality under DR-DOS, the DR-DOS codice_3 worked as a front end to the resident history buffer functionality, which remained part of the kernel.

codice_3 has also been included in IBM OS/2 Version 2.0.

In current Windows NT-based operating systems, the codice_3 functionality is built into CMD.EXE, although the codice_3 command is still used to change its operation.

The codice_3 command is not available in FreeDOS, which has such features built into the command interpreter.

==Usage==
===Command switches===
DOSKEY allows the use of several command switches:

codice_14
:Installs a new copy of DOSKEY.

;&quot;[size]&quot;
:Sets size of command history buffer to &quot;size&quot;.
:Displays all DOSKEY macros.
::Displays all DOSKEY macros for all executables which have DOSKEY macros.
:;&quot;[executable name]&quot;
::Displays all DOSKEY macros for the given executable.
:Displays all commands stored in memory.
:Specifies that new text typed is inserted in old text.
:Specifies that new text overwrites old text.

;exename
:Specifies the executable.

;filename
:Specifies a file of macros to install.
:(undocumented - since MS-DOS 7)
:(undocumented - since MS-DOS 7)
:(undocumented - since MS-DOS 7)
:(undocumented - since MS-DOS 7)
:(undocumented - since MS-DOS 7)

;&quot;[macroname]&quot;
:Specifies a name for a macro created.

;&quot;[text]&quot;
:Specifies commands to record.

===Keyboard shortcuts===
During a DOSKEY session, the following keyboard shortcuts can be used:

; and 
:Recall commands
:Clears command line
:Clears command line from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
:Clears command line from the cursor to the end of the line.
:Displays command history
:Clears command history
:Searches command history
:Selects a command by number
:Clears macro definitions

===Command macros===
DOSKEY implements support for command macros, a simple text-substitution facility which is used somewhat like command line aliases in other environments.
:Command separator. Allows multiple commands in a macro.
:Batch parameters. Equivalent to - in batch programs.
:Symbol replaced by everything following the macro name on command line.

==Alternatives==
The absence of a command history in codice_15 was a serious inconvenience ever since the earliest versions of MS-DOS. Numerous third-party programs have been written to address the issue; many were available long before Microsoft supplied DOSKEY. Some of them, including JP Software&#x27;s 4DOS and NDOS, also provide additional editing capabilities lacking in DOSKEY, such as filename completion. Some of the better-known DOSKEY alternatives are Jack Gersbach&#x27;s codice_16, Chris Dunford&#x27;s codice_17, Sverre Huseby&#x27;s codice_18, Ashok Nadkarni&#x27;s codice_19, Steven Calwas&#x27;s codice_20, Eric Tauck&#x27;s codice_21, and enhanced DOSKEY written by Paul Houle.

Paul Houle&#x27;s Enhanced DOSKEY is designed to be an enhanced drop-in replacement for the DOSKEY.COM that ships with MS-DOS and Windows 9x/Windows Me. It also has a smaller disk and memory-resident footprint. The primary added feature is command and file &quot;auto-completion&quot; via the Tab key. Version 2.5, released in 2014, also adds full support for long filenames (LFN).

<text>Doug Frost (born 11 November 1943 in Orange, New South Wales) is an Australian swimming coach, best known as the coach of Ian Thorpe. He has been made an &quot;Honor of Life Member&quot; of the Australian Swim Coaches Association and of the Padstow Swim Club, New South Wales.

Frost was a coach on the Australian national teams for the 1995, 1997 and 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships; the 1998 World Aquatics Championships and the 1998 Commonwealth Games teams and the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games team. He has been a director at the Australian Swim Coaches Association since 1989 and at the Doug Frost Swim School since 1978. After Thorpe changed coaches, Frost left the Padstow club to start afresh in Southport, Queensland. In May 2005, he was appointed the head coach of the swimming program at the Australian Institute of Sport.

In 2009 Frost was appointed head of the British Swimming ITC in Stirling, Scotland. In early 2011 he was released from the role due to continued difficult relations with several of his swimmers.

<text>The Canadian Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (CASCAR) was an auto racing sanctioning body for amateur and professional stock car racing in Canada. The company was founded in 1981 and was headquartered in Delaware, Ontario. In 2006, NASCAR purchased CASCAR and created the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series.

==History==

Established in 1981 by President Anthony Novotny, CASCAR boasted the highest level of stock car racing in Canada and sanctioned Canada&#x27;s only national stock car racing series, the CASCAR Super Series. The sanctioning body also oversaw divisions such as the Hobby Stock and CASCAR West Super Series, the latter of which replaced the Hobby Stock division and ran combination races alongside the national Super Series.

On November 16, 2004, CASCAR announced it had entered a multi-year operational and marketing agreement with NASCAR, after NASCAR had formed NASCAR Canada earlier in the year. This also opened the way for NASCAR&#x27;s purchase of CASCAR. On September 12, 2006, NASCAR completed its purchase of CASCAR and announced the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series, a series of 10–12 races from May–October 2007. On December 7, 2015, it was announced that Pinty&#x27;s Delicious Foods Inc. was the new sponsor of the series after Canadian Tire announced on February 17, 2015 that they were not renewing their sponsorship after the 2015 season.

==Automobiles==
Unlike NASCAR, which mandates the use of steel-bodied shells, CASCAR-approved cars consisted of fiberglass bodyshells covering custom-made tube-frame racing chassis.

However, as in NASCAR, CASCAR cars&#x27; engines were normally aspirated, pushrod V8 units producing approximately .

==Race courses==
CASCAR events were held on short track ovals, permanent road courses, temporary road courses and street courses.

<doc id="658606" wikidata="Q1338895" url="?curid=658606" title="Jay C. Buckey">
<text>Jay Clark Buckey, Jr. (born June 6, 1956, in New York City) is an American physician and astronaut who flew aboard one Space Shuttle mission (STS-90) as a Payload Specialist. Buckey briefly ran for the Democratic nomination to challenge New Hampshire Senator John E. Sununu, a first term Republican, when he was up for re-election in 2008. Buckey withdrew from the race when former Governor Jeanne Shaheen entered the race.

==Education==
Buckey holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University (1977) and an M.D. from Cornell in 1981, interning at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and completing his residence at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Currently, Buckey is a Professor of Medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine. He was also a flight surgeon with the U.S. Air Force Reserve for 8 years.

==Spaceflight experience==
In 1998 he was a Payload Specialist aboard NASA Space Shuttle flight STS-90 as part of the Neurolab mission from April 17 to May 3, 1998. Aboard the Neurolab Mission, Buckey was the Payload Specialist for the experiment &quot;Cardiovascular Adaptation to Zero-Gravity&quot; and assisted with other Spacelab Life Sciences experiments. During the 16-day Spacelab flight, the seven person crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times, covered 6.3 million miles, and logged him over 381 hours in space.

==Politics==
==Research==

In 2018, Buckey was part of research using virtual reality, at the Australian Antarctic Division&#x27;s Mawson Station, wherein the expeditioners used VR headsets to view Australian beach scenes, European nature scenes, and North American nature scenes of forests and urban environments, which were different from the isolation of the whiteness and silence of Antarctica. The research will inform psychological techniques to support long duration spaceflight such as for astronauts going to Mars.

<doc id="658607" wikidata="Q5292654" url="?curid=658607" title="Don Gambril">
<text>Donald Lee Gambril (born January 2, 1934) is an American former Hall of Fame swimming coach who is best known for coaching the University of Alabama from 1973 to 1990. His Alabama teams had top ten NCAA finishes eleven times, 3 Southeastern Conference titles, and were the runner-up at the NCAA Championship in 1977. Earlier, his Long Beach State teams had top ten NCAA finishes four times from 1968-71. He had the rare distinction of serving as a U.S. Olympic coach in five Olympics from 1968 to 1984.

==Education and early swimming==
Gambril was born on January 2, 1934, in Altamont, Kansas, and after moving to El Sereno, California, attended El Sereno&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson High School where he was on the swim team and played football, starting as a Center by his Senior year. He grew up shortly after the depression with a family of limited means where he learned the importance of a work ethic and the necessity of thrift. 

Gambril attended and swam for East Los Angeles Jr. College, from 1951-52, before transferring to Occidental College where he continued to swim for a year. At East Los Angeles, he specialized in distance swimming, making the Junior College All-American team in the 1500-meter event. After marrying his wife Teddy on March 14, 1953, he went to work full time and then enlisted in the Navy reserves before graduating college. Returning to complete his studies at California State, Los Angeles, he also played center and linebacker on their Football team for a year. 

===U.S. Naval service===
From around 1956-57, he served in the Navy and swam for the All-Navy &quot;B&quot; team, competing occasionally in intercollegiate swimming competition and water polo. He swam on the winning 800 free relay at the All-Navy championships. While serving on the U.S. Navy Destroyer &quot;USS Cunningham&quot;, he was able to attend though not compete in the swimming portion of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. He believed he obtained the best conditioning of his life training with the U.S. Navy Swim Team, and was deeply affected by the opportunity to view Olympic swimming competition. Gambril briefly coached J.V. Football at El Monte High School and worked as a lifeguard at the end of 1957 upon his return from Naval service. 

===Completing college===
Returning to college studies around 1957 after his service in the Navy, he completed his BA and Master&#x27;s degree while attending California State at Los Angeles around 1960. The school was about 12 miles West of Rosemead High School where Gambril was coaching.

==Early coaching positions==
=== Rosemead High and Swim Club ===
In 1958, after his Navy service, Don had his first position as a fulltime teacher, instructing Social Studies at California&#x27;s Rosemead High School, where he also coached J.V. Football. In the same year, he started Rosemead Swim Club, which he would coach in the evening after school hours, and where he would attract exceptional swimming talent. Still pursuing his teaching credentials, he received a provisional teaching certificate to take the opening. In the Spring of 1958, he also took over coaching the Rosemead High School&#x27;s swim team, a role that would soon direct his career focus. He would eventually lead the team to five league championships. He remained as coach and teacher at Rosemead through around 1963. Top women swimmers coached by Gambril at Rosemead by 1961 included Jeanne Hallock Craig, Sharon Stouder, and Pam Crotwell. 

=== Arcadia High School ===
In September 1963, Don took over the swim coach position as well as coaching Football and teaching P.E. and History at Arcadia High School, a more affluent school with a more competitive sports program and student athletes who could train full time without having to work after school. Gambril had success at Arcadia, with a few of his athletes becoming California Interscholastic Federation titlists. Gambril was gaining visibility in the Southern California swimming community as well as in neighboring states.

==Coaching California colleges and clubs, 1965-71==
===Pasadena City College===
In 1965, Pasadena City College looked to Gambril to take over their Head Coaching position. Gambril was interested in a chance to coach a college team, but worked hard to find a suitable replacement at Arcadia, eventually settling on Ray Peterson, who would do an exceptional job, and coach at Arcadia for thirty years. Gambril became known as a coach who would work hard to find outstanding coaches to replace him when he made a move. In his first full year at Pasadena City College, the team won the league championship in 1966, and won it again in 1967. Future UCLA coach Ron Ballatore would be mentored as an Assistant Coach under Gambril for one year at Pasadena City College around 1966.

===City of Commerce===

Around the same time, as his service at Pasadena City College, Gambril had an opportunity to coach a Club team that had demonstrated great achievement, as their Women&#x27;s team had attended National tournaments, and Olympic trials. He took over the City of Commerce Swimming Club team around 1965, which was composed of many Rosemead Swim Club members. Gambril had previously founded the Rosemead Club in 1958. Commerce Swimming Club was located in the small town of City of Commerce, just outside Los Angeles, and though the town was small, it was prosperous and had a beautiful new swimming facility completed in 1963. The team included 1964 Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Sharon Stouder in butterfly, who swam for Don for over five years, and 1964 world record holder Patty Caretto in distance freestyle. Other female Olympians he coached at City of Commerce included 1964 Olympic breast stroker Sandy Nitta, and 1964 Olympian Jeanne Hallock Craig. Looking back on their experience, the women at City of Commerce believed Gambril was a brilliant marketer who convinced them they could be the best in the world, and remembered him as a &quot;tough but tender-hearted leader.&quot; Gambril stayed with both teams through 1967.

===Long Beach State===
Gambril was head coach at Long Beach State from 1967 to 1971, where he mentored Assistant Coach Skip Kenney, who would become a highly accomplished coach for Stanford University. After a losing season before Gambril began coaching, Long Beach State&#x27;s dual meet record during Gambril&#x27;s tenure was a remarkable 48-3. 
The team would have more than one world record holder, including John Sylvio Fiolo, who had set the world record for the breast stroke in February 1968 before coming to swim with Don at Long Beach State. 1972 Olympian Silver medalist Hans Fassnacht, from Germany, would set the world record for the 400-meter free in 1968 under Don&#x27;s guidance at Long Beach. Fassnacht would set the world record for the 200 meter butterfly in 1970 with a time of 2:03.3, bettering Mark Spitz&#x27;s standing record by .6 seconds. Another Long Beach State swimmer, Gunnar Larsson, a 1972 two-time Olympic gold medalist , would break the record for the 400-meter free in September 1970 at the European Championship in Barcelona, improving on his own 1968 Mexico City Olympic time. With such outstanding swim talent, Long Beach State became so widely known that 1972 seven-time gold medalist Mark Spitz met Gambril and gave a verbal commitment to swim for the team around 1968 in his Senior year in High School, before deciding to swim for Indiana University.Under Gambril&#x27;s guidance, Long Beach State College had four NCAA Division I top ten finishes with a seventh place in 1968, a seventh place in 1969, a fifth place in 1970, and another fifth place in 1971. Hall of Fame Coach Dick Jochums, who would coach University of Arizona, coached Long Beach State after Gambril went to Harvard in 1971.

===Phillips 66 Long Beach===
During the same period he was coaching at Long Beach State, Gambril started and coached the Phillips 66 Club team in Long Beach, training them at Belmont Plaza Swimming Pool. Phillips 66 won three National men&#x27;s club championships in &#x27;68, &#x27;69, and &#x27;70. A few of Phillips 66 original members had come from Long Beach State College. 

==Harvard University==
Following Long Beach State, Gambril began a two-year stint from 1971 to 1973 as head coach at prestigious Harvard University, where Skip Kenney followed him to again serve as Assistant Coach. Harvard won the Ivy League Title during Gambril&#x27;s tenure and beat Yale for the first time in years.

== Olympic and International coaching ==
He was the 1984 U.S. Olympic Coach and Assistant U.S. Olympic Coach in 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1980. While in the Navy, Gambril was a spectator for the swimming competition at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In 1991, he coached the American National 1991 World Championship team.

Gambril coached many well-known Olympic swimmers, including Mark Spitz, Sharon Stouder, and Gunnar Larsson (Sweden), Matt Biondi, Nancy Hogshead, Jonty Skinner (South Africa), Hans Fassnacht (Germany) and Mary T. Meagher. He coached 1964 Canadian Olympian Barbara Hounsell, who swam for a period with the Whittier Swim Association in the Los Angeles area and 1972 Olympic 100-meter Bronze medalist Robin Backhaus.

==University of Alabama coach==
In 1973, Gambril became head coach at the University of Alabama, where he coached the men&#x27;s team for 17 years and the women&#x27;s team for 11 years, retiring from coaching in 1990. He had an overall record with Alabama of 237 wins and 32 losses. After his start in 1973, in his fourth year, he took the 1977 Alabama Swim team to the NCAA finals, finishing second. During his tenure, he also coached future Hall of Fame swimmer and Alabama Swim team three-time MVP Jonty Skinner (1975-1977), who would break the 100-meter freestyle world record in 1976 three weeks after the summer Olympics. Skinner was unable to attend the 1976 Montreal Olympics as South Africa, his native country, was banned from attending due to apartheid.

During Gambril&#x27;s seven-teen year tenure at Alabama, the swim team had 11 top ten NCAA finishes, five times the number required to be made a member of the American Swim Coaches Hall of Fame. 

In 1981, Gambril had a heart attack, and underwent quintuple bypass surgery to save his life. He changed his diet, lost weight, and made a thorough recovery, continuing to coach Alabama swimming for another nine years.

After serving seventeen years as Swim Coach at Alabama through 1990, Gambril served six years, through around 1997, as the Associate Athletic Director at Alabama where he helped to manage sports programs with the exclusion of football, men&#x27;s basketball, and gymnastics for women. In his last coaching position he coached the U.S. Swim team at the World Championships in Perth, Australia.

== Honors ==
He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame and received the USA Swimming Award in 1983. Gambril was Scholastic Coach of the Year in 1985, and was made SEC Coach of the Year four times. In 1998, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, and in 1987, was inducted into his alma mater California State University&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1996, Gambril was one of the first nominees inducted into the Occidental Aquatics Hall of Fame.

== Swimming community service ==
Gambril served on the United States Olympic Committee, and the AAU Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Swim Committees. He has served on the United States Swimming Board of Directors, and the Rule Committee for the NCAA. He also served on the board of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. 

===Coaches mentored by Gambril===
With a long history of coaching many championship teams, Gambril excelled in mentoring his assistant coaches, and worked with a number of future coaches who would make great contributions to swimming. Besides mentoring Stanford coach Skip Kenney, who worked under him at Long Beach, Harvard and Phillips 66 as mentioned earlier, he mentored coaches Dick Jochums of Arizona who coached under him for eight years at Phillips 66, and Burt Kanner, a sixteen-year San Marino High School swim Coach who assisted him at Los Angeles Swim Club in 1966-67. Princeton coach C. Rob Orr swam for Gambril at Phillips 66 for eight years, Coach Dennis Pursley of the Cincinnati Pepsi-Marlins and Lakewood Swim Clubs swam and coached with Gambril at the University of Alabama, and Pepsi-Marlins and Santa Clara Swim Club coach Jay Fitzgerald was an Alabama assistant coach under Gambril. San Jose swim club coach and 100-meter record holder Jonty Skinner swam for Gambril at Alabama, and Irvine Aquatics and Saddleback College Coach Flip Darr assisted Gambril at Phillips 66. Darr coached accomplished Olympic Gold Medalist Shirley Babashoff, among others.

In his retirement, Gambril made the short move from Tuscaloosa to Northport, Alabama. As of 2020, he continued to try to exercise with light strength training and walking.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class PH is the union of all complexity classes in the polynomial hierarchy:

:formula_1

PH was first defined by Larry Stockmeyer. It is a special case of hierarchy of bounded alternating Turing machine. It is contained in P#P = PPP and PSPACE.

PH has a simple logical characterization: it is the set of languages expressible by second-order logic.

==Relationship to other classes==

PH contains almost all well-known complexity classes inside PSPACE; in particular, it contains P, NP, and co-NP. It even contains probabilistic classes such as BPP (this is the Sipser–Lautemann theorem) and RP. However, there is some evidence that BQP, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer, is not contained in PH.

P = NP if and only if P = PH. This may simplify a potential proof of P ≠ NP, since it is only necessary to separate P from the more general class PH.

PH is a subset of P#P = PPP by Toda&#x27;s theorem; the class of problems that are decidable by a polynomial time Turing machine with access to a #P or equivalently PP oracle), and also in PSPACE.

<text>Richard Walter Quick (January 31, 1943 – June 10, 2009) was a Hall of Fame head coach for the women&#x27;s swim teams at the University of Texas from 1982 through 1988 and at Stanford University, from 1988 through 2005. In an unprecedented achievement, Quick&#x27;s Women&#x27;s teams at Texas and Stanford won a combined 12 NCAA National championships, with his Men and Women&#x27;s team at Auburn winning his final championship in 2009. His teams won a combined 22 Conference championships. He was a coach for the United States Olympic swimming team for six Olympics—1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004.

== Early swimming ==
Quick was born on January 31, 1943 to Walter and Barbara Quick in Akron, Ohio. He started swimming in Austin, Texas around the age of eight, primarily under Bill Crenshaw at the Austin Aquatics Club. When the family moved to Wichita, Kansas, he began more serious competition at the Wichita Swim Club and Wichita East High School under Robert Timmons. Timmons would later become known as the legendary track coach at Kansas University who coached Olympian Jim Ryun, though his High School swimming teams won seven state titles.

When Quick&#x27;s father Walter, a tire company official was transferred to Dallas, Richard became a top swimmer at Highland Park High School in University Park, Texas. While at Highland Park, Quick had improved on national age group records in the 200-yard Individual Medley, and 100-yard butterfly, and led in High School finals in the 200 IM, 100-yard fly, 400 freestyle, 200 freestyle, 100 back, and 100 breastroke. In college, Quick was recruited for a scholarship and swam for nearby Southern Methodist University where he made All-Southwest Conference and swam under SMU Hall of Fame Coach Red Barr while majoring in Physical Education. Quick was an SMU Team Captain in his Senior Year, and a 400-IM medley winner in a Southwestern Conference Championship, and swam at SMU with his brother Dave, a freestyle sprinting specialist. Richard was an All-American swimmer at SMU in 1965 and 1966.

==Coaching==
In one of his earliest coaching assignments immediately after college graduation, Quick coached Spring Branch Memorial High School in Houston, Texas, beginning in 1965, where he led the team to six state championships by 1971.

After Assistant coaching at SMU from 1971 through 1975, and coaching the Women&#x27;s team from 1976 through 1977 in its initial year, he had a brief head coaching position with Iowa State from 1977 through 1978, then coached both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s team at Auburn from 1978-1982. He served as head women&#x27;s swimming coach at the University of Texas from 1982 through 1988, where he excelled, leading his teams to five consecutive NCAA titles from 1984 through 1988.

===Stanford women===
While coaching the Stanford women from 1988-2005, Quick won an exceptional seven non-consecutive NCAA titles in 1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998. He developed 35 NCAA champions, winning five CSCAA Coach of the Year honors and three Pac-10 Coach of the Year awards.

At the 2000 Sydney Olympics he led the women&#x27;s team to sixteen medals. His most successful swimmer was Stanford competitor Jenny Thompson, who won ten Olympic Golds. Other notable Olympians coached by Quick include Auburn swimmer Ambrose &quot;Rowdy&quot; Gaines, Texas swimmers Tiffany Cohen, and Jill Sterkel and Stanford swimmers Summer Sanders, Misty Hyman, Lea Loveless, Catherine Fox, and Lisa Jacob. He also helped train Dara Torres and Steve Lundquist for Olympic competition. Jill Sterkel would later coach the University of Texas Women&#x27;s Team from 1993 through 2006. His Olympic athletes brought home an impressive total of 59 Olympic medals.

===Auburn===
During his initial stint at Auburn from 1978-1982, Quick led the Auburn University Tigers Mens and Women&#x27;s team to four national top ten finishes. On March 8, 2007, Auburn University announced that Quick would return to the Tigers to take over as head coach for the swimming and diving teams after David Marsh left. Quick was Marsh&#x27;s coach when he was a backstroker for Auburn. In March 2007 Marsh won his 12th NCAA National title, tying his former coach and mentor for the most (Division I) titles won by an NCAA Coach. Quick broke the tie the following year, winning a 13th title while coaching at Auburn.

===Honors===
Quick is a member of SMU&#x27;s Distinguished Alumni. In 2000 he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. He was a three time American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCAA) Coach of the Year and a five time NCAA Coach of the Year.

Quick initially retired to Austin in 2005, but in 2007 came out of retirement to coach Auburn. In December 2008 Quick was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. He died on the evening of June 10, 2009 in Austin, Texas. His 2008–09 Auburn team won the NCAA National title in March, 2009.

<text> is a short Eucharistic chant that has been set to music by many composers. It dates to the 13th century, first recorded in a central Italian Franciscan manuscript (Chicago, Newberry Library, 24). A Reichenau manuscript of the 14th century attributes it to Pope Innocent (variously identified as Innocent III, Innocent IV, Innocent V, or Innocent VI)

During the Middle Ages, it was sung at the elevation of the Eucharist during the consecration at Mass. It was also used frequently during Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.

The prayer is a meditation on Jesus&#x27;s Real Presence in the Blessed Sacrament, and ties it to the redemptive meaning of suffering in the life of all believers.

==Text==
&lt;poem lang=&quot;la&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-left:1em;&quot;&gt;Latin
Ave verum corpus, natum
de Maria Virgine,
vere passum, immolatum
in cruce pro homine
cuius latus perforatum
fluxit aqua et sanguine:
esto nobis prægustatum
in mortis examine.

O Iesu dulcis, O Iesu ,
O Iesu, fili Mariae.
Miserere mei. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left:1em;&quot;&gt; 
Hail, true Body, born
of the Virgin Mary,
truly suffered, sacrificed
on the cross for mankind,
from whose pierced side
flowed water and blood:
Be for us a foretaste [of the Heavenly banquet]
in the trial of death!

O sweet Jesus, O holy Jesus,
O Jesus, son of Mary,
have mercy on me. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;
==Musical settings==
Musical settings include Mozart&#x27;s motet &quot;Ave verum corpus&quot; (K. 618), as well as settings by William Byrd and Sir Edward Elgar. Not all composers set the whole text. For example, Mozart&#x27;s setting finishes with &quot;in mortis examine&quot;, Elgar&#x27;s with &quot;fili Mariae&quot;. Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed three versions: H.233, H.266, H.329. 

There is a version by Franz Liszt [Searle 44]. There are also versions by Camille Saint-Saëns, Orlande de Lassus, Imant Raminsh, Alexandre Guilmant, William Mathias, Colin Mawby, Malcolm Archer and Jack Gibbons. Liszt also composed a fantasy on Mozart&#x27;s work, preceded by a version of Allegri&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Miserere&quot;, under the title &quot; [Searle 461 – two versions]. Versions of this fantasy for orchestra [Searle 360] and piano four-hands [Searle 633] follow closely the second version for piano. 

There is also a version for organ [Searle 658] with the title &quot;. The chant is included Poulenc&#x27;s opera &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;. The composer wrote a different &quot;Ave verum corpus&quot; in 1952. 

Mozart&#x27;s version, with instruments only, was adapted by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as one of the sections of his &quot;Mozartiana&quot;, a tribute to Mozart. Colin Mawby has done a setting in the 20th century; from the 21st century, there are settings by the Swedish composer Fredrik Sixten and the English composer Philip Stopford.

<text>Frederick Wilford &quot;Rick&quot; Sturckow (born August 11, 1961) is an engineer, retired United States Marine Corps officer, former NASA astronaut, and commercial spacecraft pilot. Sturckow is a veteran of four Space Shuttle missions. He flew as a pilot on STS-88 and STS-105 and as a commander on STS-117 and STS-128. All four missions docked with the International Space Station, making Sturckow one of three American astronauts to visit the station four times. Sturckow later was assigned to the Johnson Space Center as a CAPCOM. He left NASA in 2013 to become a pilot for Virgin Galactic.

==Personal==
Sturckow was born La Mesa, California, but considers Lakeside, California, to be his hometown. He is married to the former Michele A. Street of Great Mills, Maryland. He enjoys flying and physical training. His father, Karl H. Sturckow, resides in Whittier, California, and his mother, Janette R. Sturckow, resides in La Mesa. He was a member of the Marine Corps Association (MCA) and a former member of Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP).

Sturckow has the nickname &quot;CJ&quot;, which stands for &quot;Caustic Junior&quot;. It was given to him when he was a young Marine, because he resembled a squadron commander who was appropriately called &quot;Caustic&quot;.

==Education==
Sturckow graduated from Grossmont High School, La Mesa, California, in 1978. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from California Polytechnic State University in 1984, and a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Florida Institute of Technology in 2000.

==Awards and honors==
Defense Superior Service Medal, Single Mission Air Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot;, Strike/Flight Air Medals (4), Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, NASA Space Flight Medals (4).

==Military career==
Sturckow was commissioned into the U.S. Marine Corps in December 1984. An honor graduate of The Basic School, he earned his aviator wings in April 1987. Following initial F/A-18 training at VFA-125, he reported to VMFA-333, MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina. While assigned to VMFA-333 he made an overseas deployment to Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines and was then selected to attend the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) in March 1990. In August 1990, he deployed to Sheik Isa Air Base, Bahrain for a period of eight months. Sturckow flew a total of forty-one combat missions during Operation Desert Storm. In January 1992 he attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California. In 1993 he reported to the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, for duty as the F/A-18 E/F Project Pilot. Sturckow also flew a wide variety of projects and classified programs as an F/A-18 test pilot.

Sturckow retired from the Marine Corps as a colonel, in September, 2009, after 25 years of active duty service. He has logged over 6,500 flight hours in more than 60 different aircraft.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in December 1994, Sturckow reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. He completed a year of training and evaluation and was assigned to work technical issues for the Vehicle Systems and Operations Branch of the Astronaut Office. He served as pilot on STS-88 in 1998 (the first International Space Station assembly mission), and on STS-105 in 2001. Sturckow was the commander of the STS-117 mission in 2007, and of the STS-128 mission launched on August 28, 2009. Sturckow was also the launch CAPCOM for STS-130 in February 2010, and for STS-131 in April 2010. On January 13, 2011, NASA named Sturckow as the backup commander for STS-134. The appointment allowed the commander, Mark Kelly (who subsequently flew the mission), to continue to support his wife, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, while she recovered from an attempted assassination.

Sturckow left NASA in March 2013. During his 18-year tenure, he served in multiple technical and leadership roles supporting Johnson Space Center&#x27;s Astronaut Office including chief of the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) Branch and chief of the International Space Station Branch.

==Post-NASA career==
On May 8, 2013, Virgin Galactic announced they had hired Sturckow for flight testing of the SpaceShipTwo spacecraft and the White Knight Two aircraft, as the company prepares for subsequent commercial operations. On December 13, 2018, he reached outer space with the VSS &quot;Unity&quot; according to America&#x27;s definition of the space border.

<text>William Sweetenham AM (born 23 March 1950) is an elite swimming coach. He has coached swimming teams of Australia, Britain, Hong Kong and the Argentina national swimming team. During his career, Sweetenham was Head National Team Coach at five Olympic Games, coached 27 medallists at the Olympic Games and World Championships, and nine world record holders.

==Career==

===Australia===

Sweetenham began his coaching career in his hometown of Mount Isa. He then replaced Laurie Lawrence at the Carina Swimming Club in Brisbane, Queensland. While at the club he coached three of the greatest distance swimmers – Stephen Holland, Tracey Wickham and Michelle Ford. Sweetenham then became the first Queensland Director of Coaching.

In 1980, Sweetenham was appointed inaugural Women&#x27;s Head Swimming Coach at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). From late 1985 to 1991, he was Head Coach. During his time at the AIS, Sweetenham was involved in coaching Olympic and Commonwealth Games medallists Michelle Pearson, Karen Phillips, Suzanne Landells, Georgina Parkes and Rob Woodhouse. In 1983, while at the AIS, he suffered serious leg injuries as a result of a car accident in West Germany. From 1995 to 2001, he was the National Youth Coach for Swimming Australia and during this period the programme produced a number of future Australian national team members including Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett. He managed the Australian swim team for four Olympic Games and five Commonwealth Games.

===Hong Kong===
In 1991, he was Head Swimming Coach at the Hong Kong Sports Institute and Hong Kong&#x27;s Head Olympic Swim Coach. He returned to Australia in 1995 to become Swimming Australia&#x27;s National Youth Coach.

===Great Britain National Performance Director===

Sweetenham&#x27;s tenure with Great Britain was marked by medal success at World Championship level, Olympic disappointment, and recurring controversy on his man-management methods. He was the National Performance Director for British Swimming from November 2000 to September 2007. Prior to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, Sweetenham&#x27;s tenure as Director marked considerable progress in British swimming. Britain won as many medals at the 2001, 2003 and 2005 Swimming World Championships as it had at all previous World Championships back to 1973.

On 3 September 2007, British Swimming announced that Bill Sweetenham had stood down as NPD citing personal reasons. Sweetenham had previously indicated that he would not renew his contract, which was due for renewal following the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

=== Argentina ===
The Argentina Federation of Water Sports reported in 2013 about the arrival of Bill Sweetenham, for beginning work in conjunction with the national team and in order to improve the areas of training, technical training bodies, and sports organizations in the coming years. This initiative was supported by the ENARD and Sports Secretary&#x27;s Office, will have to Sweetenham until day 28 in Argentina.

==Publishing==
Sweetenham has been a prolific contributor to swimming coaching. In 1998, he produced a nine-volume video collection titled &quot;Swimming in the 21st Century&quot; which covered all the swimming strokes. In 2003, with John Atkinson he wrote &quot;Championship Swim Training&quot;.

Dezhurov was awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation medal and the Pilot/Cosmonaut title by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation. He has been also awarded three Air Force medals during his career.

==Cosmonaut career==

In 1987, he was assigned to the Cosmonaut Training Center. From December 1987 to June 1989, he underwent a course of general space training. Since September 1989, he has continued training as a member of a group of test cosmonauts. Since 1991, he has been a correspondence student at the Yuri A. Gagarin Air Force Academy.

=== Mir EO-18 ===
In March 1994, Dezhurov began flight training as commander of the prime crew of the Mir-18 mission. The crew was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 14, 1995, aboard the Soyuz TM-21 spacecraft. Following a two-day solo flight, the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the Mir on March 16. Dezhurov served as the Mir E-18 commander. There were several technical problems during this mission. The crew also performed life science experiments. Following a 115-day flight, the mission concluded with landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on July 7, 1995.

=== Expedition 3 ===

Dezhurov lived and worked aboard the International Space Station where he served as a member of the Expedition 3 crew. carrying Dezhurov and six other crewmembers on STS-105 mission blasted off to space from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August 10, 2001. The shuttle docked with the ISS on 12 August at 18:41 UTC. Dezhurov spent approximately 4 months aboard the station as a flight engineer. During the long-duration mission the Expedition 3 crew enjoyed a unique view of the 2001 Leonid meteor storm. At the end of the stay Expedition 3 crewmembers, Dezhurov, NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson and cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin returned to Earth on board Space Shuttle . &quot;Endeavour&quot; STS-108 mission delivered the Expedition 4 crew to the ISS and landed at KSC on December 17, 2001.

===Spacewalks ===
During his cosmonaut career, Dezhurov has performed nine spacewalks. During Mir EO-18 long-duration mission Dezhurov together with cosmonaut Gennady Strekalov conducted five spacewalks. As of June 2010, his nine spacewalks totalling 37 hours and 2 minutes has placed him in the 25th position in the list of astronauts who have the most extra-vehicular activity (EVA) time.

On 12 May 1995, Dezhurov conducted his first career spacewalk. The spacewalk started 04:20:44 UTC and ended at 10:35:16 UTC. He and Strekalov prepared for the arrival of the Spektr module and prepared to move Kristall&#x27;s solar panel. They also practiced work at the Kristall module. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 14 minutes.

Dezhurov performed his second career spacewalk on May 17. They moved the solar array to the Kvant-1 module. The spacewalk lasted six hours and 52 minutes.

On May 22, Dezhurov and Strekalov installed the solar array on Kvant-1 and stowed Kristall&#x27;s another solar array. The excursion out of the Mir Space Station marked Dezhurov&#x27;s third career spacewalk. The spacewalk started at 00:10:20 UTC and was completed at 05:25:11 UTC. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 14 minutes.

On 28 May and June 1, 1995, Dezhurov and Strekolov conducted two spacewalks to prepare Mir to move Kristall and Spektr modules. Dezhurov&#x27;s fourth and fifth career spacewalks lasted 21 and 23 minutes respectively.

Dezhurov conducted another four spacewalks during the Expedition 3 mission to the ISS. On October 8, 2001, Dezhurov and Tyurin ventured outside the ISS to mark the 100th spacewalk to be carried out by Russian cosmonauts. The main objective of the spacewalk was to outfit the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment and make connections between that newly arrived compartment and the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. The spacewalkers installed a cable that allows space walk radio communications between the two station sections. They also installed handrails on the new compartment and an exterior ladder that will be used to help spacewalkers leave &quot;Pirs&quot;″ hatch. Dezhurov and Tyurin also installed a Strela cargo crane onto the station. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 58 minutes ending at 19:21 UTC.

On October 15, 2001, Dezhurov performed his seventh career spacewalk. The two spacewalkers returned to space outside the ISS from the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock. Dezhurov and Tyurin installed Russian commercial experiments on the exterior of &quot;Pirs&quot;. Among the experiments is a set of investigations of how various materials react to the space environment over a long time. Called MPAC-SEEDS, the investigation is housed in three briefcase-sized containers. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 52 minutes.

On November 12, 2001, Dezhurov conducted his eighth career spacewalk. Dezhurov and NASA astronaut Culbertson connected cables on the exterior of the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment for the Kurs automated docking system. They completed checks of the Strela cargo crane, using one space walker at the end of the crane&#x27;s boom to simulate a cargo. They also inspected and photographed a small panel of one solar array on the Zvezda Service Module that has one portion of a panel not fully unfolded. The spacewalk was conducted in Russian Orlan spacesuits. It lasted 5 hours and 4 minutes. 
On December 3, 2001, Dezhurov conducted his ninth career spacewalk. Dressed in Orlan spacesuits, Tyurin and Dezhurov floated out of the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock at 13:20 UTC. Dezhurov and Tyurin used a cutting tool to remove an errant rubber seal that had prevented a Progress resupply ship from firmly docking with the ISS. The two spacewalkers also took pictures of the debris, which was a rubberized seal from the previous cargo ship, and of the docking interface. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 46 minutes.

<doc id="658646" wikidata="Q23047" url="?curid=658646" title="Cahors">
<text>Cahors (; ) is a commune in the western part of Southern France. It is the smallest prefecture among the 13 departments that constitute the Occitanie Region. The capital and main city of the Lot department and the historical center of the Quercy, Cahors is home to 20,141 &quot;cadurciennes&quot; and &quot;cadurciens&quot; (2021).

Nestled in a meander of the Lot and surrounded by steep arid limestone hills, this historic city is home to a great monumental diversity, mainly inherited from Roman times and the Middle Ages; the city&#x27;s monuments include a historic city centre, Saint-Étienne cathedral, Roman walls and the famous Valentré bridge (a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the pilgrimage path to Santiago de Compostela). Famed for its wine and gastronomy (truffles and foie gras), this southern French city holds the label of the French Towns of Art and History. The Cadurcian economy is reliant on tertiary services and makes Cahors the Lot&#x27;s economic centre.

==History==

Cahors has had a rich history since Celtic times. The original name of the town was Divona or &quot;Divona Cadurcorum&quot;, &quot;Divona of the Cadurci,&quot; Divona was a fountain, now called &quot;la fontaine des Chartreux&quot;, worshiped by the Cadurci, a Celtic people of Gaul before the Roman conquest in the 50s BC. The Cadurci were among the last Celtic tribes to resist the Roman invasion. &quot;Cahors&quot; derives from &quot;Cadurcorum&quot;. However, romanization was rapid and profound: Cahors became a large Roman city, with many monuments whose remnants can be seen today. It has declined economically since the Middle Ages, and lost its university in the 18th century. Today it is a popular tourist centre with people coming to enjoy its medieval quarter and the 14th-century fortified Valentré bridge. It is the seat of the Diocese of Cahors.

It was also notorious at that time for the financiers widely known as Cahorsins, Christians who charged interest on their loans. The church in these times said that using money as an end in itself (usury) was a sin. Because of this Cahors became synonymous with this sin, and was mentioned in Dante&#x27;s Inferno (XI.50) alongside Sodom as wicked.

Pope John XXII, born Jacques Duèze or d&#x27;Euse, was born in Cahors in 1244, the son of a shoemaker.

In the 2007 Tour de France, Cahors was the start of stage 18. Cahors also in the 2022 Tour de France was the finish of stage 19.

The legend associated with this bridge is one of the most fully realized of all Devil&#x27;s Bridge legends, with a carefully developed plot, complex characters, and a surprising dénouement. When the bridge was restored in 1879, the architect Paul Gout made reference to this by placing a small sculpture of the devil at the summit of one of the towers.

<text>Barry Brookes Longyear (born May 12, 1942) is an American author who resides in New Sharon, Maine.

==Career==
Born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Longyear is known best for the Hugo- and Nebula Award–winning novella &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; (1979, &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;), which was subsequently made into an identically titled movie (1985) and a novelization in collaboration with David Gerrold. The story is of an encounter between a human and an alien soldier, whose races are at war. They are marooned together in space and have to come to overcome their mutual distrust in order to cooperate and survive. A greatly expanded version of the original novella as well as two novels completing the trilogy, &quot;The Tomorrow Testament&quot; and &quot;The Last Enemy&quot;, are gathered with additional materials into &quot;The Enemy Papers&quot;.

The novella helped Longyear to win the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1980. He was the only writer to win the Hugo, Nebula, and Campbell awards during the same year until this was matched by Rebecca Roanhorse in 2018.

He also wrote the series Circus World and Infinity Hold, several stand-alone novels, numerous short stories, and two books for the &quot;Alien Nation&quot; novelization series. His trilogy &quot;Infinity Hold&quot;, &quot;Kill All the Lawyers&quot;, and &quot;Keep the Law&quot;, was released during 2002 in a single paperback volume titled &quot;Infinity Hold 3&quot; by the Author&#x27;s Guild in a Backinprint.com edition. His recent Jaggers &amp; Shad mystery stories, featuring two detectives in the Artificial Beings Crimes Division (Devon Office), are set mostly in Exeter and the surrounding Devon countryside and villages. The first of the tales, &quot;The Good Kill&quot; won the &quot;Analog&quot; AnLab award for Best Novella in 2006 and &quot;Murder in Parliament Street&quot; won the same award for 2007. &quot;The Hook&quot; won the 2021 Prometheus Award.

The series Circus World chronicles the adventures of a space-going circus troupe whose spaceship crashes, marooning them on a deserted planet without contact with the outside world.

The series Infinity Hold concerns a society developing from a group of violent convicts dumped on a new planet without police or government.

&quot;Saint Mary Blue&quot; is a novel about the course of treatment of a man who has substance abuse and mental health problems, while resident in a treatment facility.

&quot;The God Box&quot; is a stand-alone fantasy novel with a protagonist who finds himself the keeper of a small wooden box that provides cryptic guidance from the gods. He must stay ahead of a deadly manhunt and play his role in an ancient prophecy. The box, if asked, takes what he does not need, and gives him what he does need—but what he needs and what he thinks he needs are usually very different. This lends itself to humorous and unexpected situations.

Longyear has also written a mystery series, &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Son&quot; trilogy (2011) and &quot;Rope Paper Scissors&quot; (2013), all featuring Joe Torio.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the polynomial hierarchy (sometimes called the polynomial-time hierarchy) is a hierarchy of complexity classes that generalize the classes [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and [[co-NP]]. Each class in the hierarchy is contained within [[PSPACE]]. The hierarchy can be defined using oracle machines or alternating Turing machines. It is a resource-bounded counterpart to the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy from mathematical logic. The union of the classes in the hierarchy is denoted [[PH (complexity)|PH]].

Classes within the hierarchy have complete problems (with respect to polynomial-time reductions) that ask if quantified Boolean formulae hold, for formulae with restrictions on the quantifier order. It is known that equality between classes on the same level or consecutive levels in the hierarchy would imply a &quot;collapse&quot; of the hierarchy to that level.

==Definitions==
There are multiple equivalent definitions of the classes of the polynomial hierarchy.

===Oracle definition===
For the oracle definition of the polynomial hierarchy, define

:formula_1

where P is the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time. Then for i ≥ 0 define

:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4

where formula_5 is the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a Turing machine augmented by an oracle for some complete problem in class A; the classes formula_6 and formula_7 are defined analogously. For example, formula_8, and formula_9 is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine with an oracle for some NP-complete problem.

===Quantified Boolean formulae definition ===
For the existential/universal definition of the polynomial hierarchy, let be a language (i.e. a decision problem, a subset of {0,1}*), let be a polynomial, and define

: formula_10

where formula_11 is some standard encoding of the pair of binary strings &quot;x&quot; and &quot;w&quot; as a single binary string. The language &quot;L&quot; represents a set of ordered pairs of strings, where the first string &quot;x&quot; is a member of formula_12, and the second string &quot;w&quot; is a &quot;short&quot; (formula_13) witness testifying that &quot;x&quot; is a member of formula_12. In other words, formula_15 if and only if there exists a short witness &quot;w&quot; such that formula_16. Similarly, define

: formula_17
Note that De Morgan&#x27;s laws hold: formula_18 and formula_19, where &quot;L&quot;c is the complement of &quot;L&quot;.

Let be a class of languages. Extend these operators to work on whole classes of languages by the definition

:formula_20
:formula_21

Again, De Morgan&#x27;s laws hold: formula_22 and formula_23, where formula_24.

The classes NP and co-NP can be defined as formula_25, and formula_26, where P is the class of all feasibly (polynomial-time) decidable languages. The polynomial hierarchy can be defined recursively as

:formula_27
:formula_28
:formula_29

Note that formula_30, and formula_31.

This definition reflects the close connection between the polynomial hierarchy and the arithmetical hierarchy, where R and RE play roles analogous to P and NP, respectively. The analytic hierarchy is also defined in a similar way to give a hierarchy of subsets of the real numbers.

===Alternating Turing machines definition===
An alternating Turing machine is a non-deterministic Turing machine with non-final states partitioned into existential and universal states. It is eventually accepting from its current configuration if: it is in an existential state and can transition into some eventually accepting configuration; or, it is in a universal state and every transition is into some eventually accepting configuration; or, it is in an accepting state.

We define formula_32 to be the class of languages accepted by an alternating Turing machine in polynomial time such that the initial state is an existential state and every path the machine can take swaps at most &quot;k&quot; – 1 times between existential and universal states. We define formula_33 similarly, except that the initial state is a universal state.

If we omit the requirement of at most &quot;k&quot; – 1 swaps between the existential and universal states, so that we only require that our alternating Turing machine runs in polynomial time, then we have the definition of the class AP, which is equal to PSPACE.

==Relations between classes in the polynomial hierarchy==

The union of all classes in the polynomial hierarchy is the complexity class PH.

The definitions imply the relations:

:formula_34
:formula_35
:formula_36

Unlike the arithmetic and analytic hierarchies, whose inclusions are known to be proper, it is an open question whether any of these inclusions are proper, though it is widely believed that they all are. If any formula_37, or if any formula_38, then the hierarchy &quot;collapses to level k&quot;: for all formula_39, formula_40. In particular, we have the following implications involving unsolved problems:

* P = NP if and only if P = PH.
* If NP = co-NP then NP = PH. (co-NP is formula_41.)
The case in which NP = PH is also termed as a &quot;collapse&quot; of the PH to &quot;the second level&quot;. The case P = NP corresponds to a collapse of PH to P.

The question of collapse to the first level is generally thought to be extremely difficult. Most researchers do not believe in a collapse, even to the second level.

== Relationships to other classes ==

The polynomial hierarchy is an analogue (at much lower complexity) of the exponential hierarchy and arithmetical hierarchy.

It is known that PH is contained within PSPACE, but it is not known whether the two classes are equal. One useful reformulation of this problem is that PH = PSPACE if and only if second-order logic over finite structures gains no additional power from the addition of a transitive closure operator over relations of relations (i.e., over the second-order variables).

If the polynomial hierarchy has any complete problems, then it has only finitely many distinct levels. Since there are PSPACE-complete problems, we know that if PSPACE = PH, then the polynomial hierarchy must collapse, since a PSPACE-complete problem would be a formula_42-complete problem for some &quot;k&quot;.

Each class in the polynomial hierarchy contains formula_43-complete problems (problems complete under polynomial-time many-one reductions). Furthermore, each class in the polynomial hierarchy is &quot;closed under formula_43-reductions&quot;: meaning that for a class in the hierarchy and a language formula_45, if formula_46, then formula_47 as well. These two facts together imply that if formula_48 is a complete problem for formula_49, then formula_50, and formula_51. For instance, formula_52. In other words, if a language is defined based on some oracle in , then we can assume that it is defined based on a complete problem for . Complete problems therefore act as &quot;representatives&quot; of the class for which they are complete.

The Sipser–Lautemann theorem states that the class BPP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.

Kannan&#x27;s theorem states that for any &quot;k&quot;, formula_53 is not contained in SIZE(nk).

Toda&#x27;s theorem states that the polynomial hierarchy is contained in P#P.

<text>Helmuts Balderis-Sildedzis (born 31 July 1952) is a former Soviet and Latvian professional ice hockey player. He played on the right wing and participated at the 1980 Winter Olympics, where the Soviet team unexpectedly lost to the United States. He played part of a single season in the National Hockey League after being drafted in 1989 by the Minnesota North Stars, becoming the oldest player to be drafted by an NHL team at the age of 36. In 1998, he was inducted into International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==

Balderis played in the Soviet Hockey League for Dinamo Riga (1969–1977, 1980–1985) and CSKA Moscow (1977–80), having been transferred to the latter as a precondition for being accepted in the Soviet national team. He was the leading scorer in the 1977 and 1984 seasons, winning the Player of the Year award in 1977. He was the best player of the Latvian SSR in the 1970s and 1980s and the most prolific scorer from the republic, tallying 333 goals in Soviet league play.

Balderis played for the Soviet national team at multiple tournaments, winning the silver medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics and gold medals at the World Championships in 1978, 1979 and 1983. Overall, Balderis played in five World Championships (1976–1979, 1983), 1976 Canada Cup and 1980 Winter Olympics. He was named Best Forward in the 1977 World Championships. Balderis was not selected for the USSR&#x27;s 1984 Olympic team and played in only one major international tournament after he left CSKA Moscow to go back to play for Dinamo Riga in 1980.

In 1985, Balderis retired and became a coach in Japan. He returned in 1989, when Soviet players were allowed to play in the NHL. Balderis was drafted by the Minnesota North Stars, playing 26 games and scoring 3 goals with 6 assists. He became the oldest player drafted by an NHL team (36) and the oldest player to score his first goal (37). He retired again after one season in Minnesota, but came out of retirement for the second time when Latvia regained its independence. Balderis played several games for the newly recreated Latvian national team (in 1992), serving as its captain and scoring 2 goals. He later coached the team and served as its general manager. As of 2017, he serves as a board member of the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation.

<doc id="658665" wikidata="Q2941458" url="?curid=658665" title="List of Saturday Night Live cast members">
<text>, the late-night live variety series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) has featured 167 cast members. The ensemble was originally referred to as the Not Ready for Prime Time Players.

==List==

As of 2024, 167 comedians have served as cast members on the show. Sid Caesar is the only person to be named an honorary cast member. Caesar was presented with a plaque during the goodnights of his hosting stint in 1983.

===Table===
===Timeline===
Lighter colors denote &quot;featured players&quot; versus repertory cast members.


==Tenures==

===Longest tenures===
The following comedians have served as cast members on the show for more than 9 seasons:

===Shortest tenures===
Two people have been publicly announced as having been hired to the cast, but never performed as cast members:

*Catherine O&#x27;Hara, hired in 1981, quit before appearing on air. She has subsequently hosted the show twice.
*Shane Gillis was announced as a cast member in 2019, but the offer was withdrawn due to controversies surrounding past use of racial stereotypes. Gillis went on to host episode 12 of season 49. Eight months after Gillis hosted the show, executive producer Lorne Michaels revealed that the decision to fire Gillis was not his, and it was forced on him by NBC executives.

One person was credited as a cast member but did not actually appear on the show as such.
*Emily Prager was hired as part of Ebersol&#x27;s temporary season six cast following the termination of Jean Doumanian. She was credited for one episode even though she did not appear on the show, as her skit was cut after dress rehearsal. She was not chosen for season seven of the show. Prager had worked as a writer on the show, and also made several appearances in skits prior to being officially named as a member of the cast.

The following cast members spent less than a full 20-episode season on the show.

==President of the United States impressionists==

Darrell Hammond had the longest tenure portraying a U.S. president, portraying Bill Clinton from 1995 to 2001 and George W. Bush during 2003. He, Joe Piscopo, Phil Hartman, and James Austin Johnson are the only cast members to have portrayed two sitting presidents. Jason Sudeikis portrayed two sitting presidents, but the portrayal of the second president was performed as a host, rather than a cast member. Dana Carvey also portrayed two sitting presidents, with the portrayal of the second president performed as a recurring guest.

George H. W. Bush grew fond of Dana Carvey&#x27;s impersonation of him. Carvey was invited to headline a White House Christmas party in 1992, during the lame duck period after Bush had lost the election. Two years later, on October 22, 1994, when Carvey hosted the show for the first time, Bush appeared in pre-recorded videos, in both the cold open and the opening monologue, critiquing Carvey&#x27;s impersonation of him.

Presidents are not usually portrayed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after they leave office. Exceptions are limited to the portrayal of former president Richard Nixon who left office prior to the launch of the show in 1975, Bill Clinton who appeared in sketches related to the presidential campaigns of his wife, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump who continued to be politically active after leaving office. Dan Aykroyd portrayed Nixon from 1975 to 1979, and Darrell Hammond portrayed Nixon on episode 12 of season 34. James Austin Johnson portrayed Trump during the period between Trump&#x27;s two presidencies (seasons 47–50).

===Impersonation of Donald Trump===

Donald Trump, having been a public figure before being president, was portrayed by several cast members over the years. He was portrayed by Phil Hartman (1988–1990), Darrell Hammond (1999–2011, 2015–2016), Jason Sudeikis (2012) and Taran Killam (2015). Alec Baldwin started impersonating Trump as a guest during the 42nd season of &quot;SNL&quot; in late 2016, when Trump was the Republican nominee during the 2016 United States presidential elections. Baldwin continued with the guest impersonations of Trump after the elections when Trump was president-elect, as well as after Trump was sworn in as president. Baldwin continued to impersonate Trump throughout Trump&#x27;s first presidency.

Alec Baldwin&#x27;s impersonation of Donald Trump earned him an Emmy award in 2017, in spite of his public declaration that he &quot;loathes the role.&quot; At the end of Season 44, Baldwin publicly announced that he will cease impersonating Trump, but changed his mind prior to the beginning of Season 45 after &quot;SNL&quot; executive producer Lorne Michaels convinced him to continue with the impersonation. Following the 2020 presidential elections in which Trump lost re-election, Baldwin tweeted &quot;I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever been this overjoyed to lose a job before!&quot; As of 2025, Baldwin&#x27;s recurring guest appearances during Trump&#x27;s presidency makes Trump the only sitting U.S. president in the show&#x27;s history who was not portrayed by a member of the show&#x27;s principal cast. Although since Trump has been re-elected, he will likely be played by cast member James Austin Johnson (who played the role several times prior to Trump&#x27;s re-election); still making Baldwin the only non-cast member to portray a sitting president throughout at least one term.

Trump has criticized Baldwin&#x27;s portrayal on multiple occasions. In response, Baldwin taunted Trump with statements such as &quot;release your tax returns and I&#x27;ll stop.&quot; In June 2021, after Trump had left office, it was reported that while Trump was in office he had inquired if the Federal Communications Commission or the United States Justice Department could force &quot;SNL&quot; to stop portraying him. Trump denied that he has ever made such an inquiry, but claimed that his portrayal by &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;should be considered an illegal campaign contribution from the Democrat Party.&quot; He also criticized Baldwin&#x27;s portrayal of him, but praised Darrell Hammond&#x27;s portrayal of him.

==Returning to host==
Over three dozen former &quot;SNL&quot; cast members have returned to host the show. The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. Chase is also the first former cast member to reach the Five-Timers Club, and is the most frequent-former cast member to host (he is also one of few hosts banned from hosting, having last hosted in 1997). Chase returned as a guest at the 50th Anniversary Special.

In addition to Chase, other former cast members that are in the Five-Timers Club are Bill Murray, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, and Kristen Wiig. Fey has hosted six times, which makes her the most frequent former female cast member to host the show. Martin Short is the most recent member of the Five-Timers Club, having hosted the show most recently on December 21, 2024, during the show&#x27;s 50th season.

The show&#x27;s 22nd season is notable, as seven of the 20 hosts were former cast members. They included Dana Carvey, Robert Downey Jr., Phil Hartman, Chris Rock, Martin Short, Chase and Mike Myers.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus was the first former female cast member to come back to host the show; hosting it near the end of its 31st season in May 2006.

While the majority of cast members who also hosted the show were first cast members and then hosted after leaving the show, there have been two cast members who have hosted the show prior to joining the cast: Billy Crystal (he hosted the show twice during the ninth season prior to joining the cast in the tenth season) and Michael McKean (he hosted the show in the tenth season and joined the cast in the nineteenth season). McKean is also the only eventual cast member who first appeared as a musical guest (with Spinal Tap, May 1984).

Eddie Murphy is the only cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member. He also holds the distinction of having the longest gap between successive hosting of the show, with his second and third hostings of the show having been 35 years and 6 days apart.

Adam Sandler and Dan Aykroyd tie the record of the longest gap between leaving the show as a cast member and returning as a host. Both hosted the show for the first time nine days shy of 24 years from their last appearance as cast members. However, both made appearances on the show during the gap. On the flip side, Bill Murray holds the record for having the shortest gap between leaving the show and returning to host at 287 days after leaving the cast.

==The &quot;&quot;SNL&quot; Curse&quot;==
Although &quot;SNL&quot; is best known as the launchpad for many successful careers, eight former cast members have died before the age of 60. This has given rise to a superstition known as the &quot;&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Curse&quot;.

<text>Shemp Howard (born Samuel Horwitz; March 11, 1895 – November 22, 1955) was an American comedian and actor. He is best known as the third Stooge in The Three Stooges, a role he played when the act began in the early 1920s (1923–1932), while it was still associated with Ted Healy and known as &quot;Ted Healy and his Stooges&quot;; and again from 1946 until his death in 1955. During the fourteen years between his times with the Stooges, he had a successful solo career as a film comedian, including a series of shorts by himself and with partners. He reluctantly returned to the Stooges as a favor to his brother Moe and friend Larry Fine to replace his brother Curly as the third Stooge after Curly&#x27;s illness.

==Early life==
Howard was born Samuel Horwitz on March 11, 1895 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York. He was the third of five Horwitz brothers born to Lithuanian Jewish parents Solomon Gorwitz (1872–1943) and Jennie Gorwitz (1870–1939). His parents, who were second cousins, were from Kaunas and spoke the Litvak dialect of Yiddish. They married in 1888 and two years later immigrated to New York City. They initially lived with Jennie&#x27;s brother Julius in Manhattan before eventually moving to Brooklyn, where they started their family. He had two older brothers, Isadore &quot;Irving&quot; (1891–1939) and Benjamin Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; (1893–1976). His two younger brothers were Moses &quot;Moe&quot; (1897–1975) and Jerome &quot;Curly&quot; (1903–1952).

Howard, who was named Samuel after his mother&#x27;s grandfather, Shmuel, was known as Sam. However, his mother&#x27;s thick accent left her unable to articulate the name Sam. Instead she pronounced it as &quot;Shem&quot; and then &quot;Shemp&quot;, the latter of which stuck as his nickname.

==Career==
===Show business===
Shemp&#x27;s brother Moe Howard started in show business as a youngster, on stage and in films. Moe and Shemp eventually tried their hands as minstrel-show-style &quot;blackface&quot; comedians with an act they called &quot;Howard and HowardA Study in Black&quot;. At the same time, they worked for a rival vaudeville circuit, without makeup.

By 1922, Moe had teamed up with his boyhood friend Ted Healy in a &quot;roughhouse&quot; act. One day Moe spotted his brother Shemp in the audience and yelled at him from the stage. Quick-witted Shemp yelled right back, and walked up onto the stage. From then on he was part of the act, usually known as &quot;Ted Healy and His Stooges&quot;. The Howard brothers were the original Stooges; Larry Fine joined them in 1928. On stage, Healy sang and told jokes while his three noisy stooges got in his way, and Healy retaliated with physical and verbal abuse. Shemp played a bumbling fireman in the Stooges&#x27; first film, &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot; (1930), the only film where he played one of Healy&#x27;s gang.

After a disagreement with Healy in August 1930, Moe, Larry and Shemp left to launch their own act, &quot;Howard, Fine &amp; Howard&quot;, and joined the RKO vaudeville circuit. They premiered at Los Angeles&#x27;s Paramount Theatre on August 28, 1930. In 1931, they added &quot;Three Lost Soles&quot; to the act&#x27;s name and took on Jack Walsh as their straight man. Moe, Larry and Shemp continued until July 1932, when Ted Healy approached them to team up again for the Shuberts&#x27; Broadway revue &quot;Passing Show of 1932&quot;, and they accepted the offer. In spite of their past differences, Moe knew an association with the nationally known Healy would provide opportunities the three comics were not getting on their own.

On August 16, 1932, in a contract dispute, Healy walked out of the Shuberts&#x27; revue during rehearsals. Three days later, tired of what he considered Healy&#x27;s domineering handling of the Stooges&#x27; career, Shemp left Healy&#x27;s act to remain with &quot;Passing Show&quot;, which closed in September during roadshow performances and after pan reviews in Detroit and Cincinnati. Shemp regrouped to form his own act and played on the road for a few months. He landed at Brooklyn&#x27;s Vitaphone Studios for movie appearance opportunities in May 1933. When he split from Healy, Shemp was immediately replaced by his and Moe&#x27;s younger brother Jerry Howard, known as Curly.

===Solo years===
After leaving the Three Stooges, Shemp Howard, like many New York City-based performers, found work at Vitaphone. Originally playing bit roles in their six two-reel Roscoe Arbuckle comedies made from 1932 to 1933, showing off his comical appearance, he was given speaking roles and supporting parts almost immediately. He was featured with studio comics Jack Haley, Ben Blue and Gus Shy; then co-starred with Harry Gribbon, Daphne Pollard, and Johnnie Berkes, and finally starred in his own two-reel comedies. The independently produced &quot;Convention Girl&quot; (1935) featured Shemp in a very rare straight role as a blackmailer and would-be murderer.

Shemp preferred to improvise dialogue and jokes, which became his trademark. In late 1935, Vitaphone was licensed to produce two-reel short comedies based on the &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; comic strip. Shemp was cast as Knobby Walsh, and although only a supporting character, he became the comic focus of the series, with Johnnie Berkes and Lee Weber as his foils. He co-starred in the first seven shorts, released in 1936–1937. Nine of them were produced, the last two done after Shemp&#x27;s departure from Vitaphone.

Howard unsuccessfully attempted to lead his own group of &quot;stooges&quot; in the Van Beuren musical comedy short &quot;The Knife of the Party&quot;. In 1937, he followed his brothers&#x27; lead, moved to the West Coast, and landed supporting actor roles at several studios, mainly Columbia Pictures and Universal. He worked exclusively at Universal from August 1940 to August 1943, performing with such comics as W. C. Fields, and with comedy duos Abbott and Costello and Olsen and Johnson. He lent comic relief to Charlie Chan and The Thin Man murder mysteries. He appeared in several Universal B-musicals of the early 1940s, including &quot;Private Buckaroo&quot; (1942), &quot;Strictly in the Groove&quot; (1942), &quot;How&#x27;s About It?&quot; (1943), &quot;Moonlight and Cactus&quot; (1944) and &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot; (1941); in the latter of which he was paired with Lon Chaney Jr. as a faux Abbott and Costello. Most of these projects took advantage of his improvisational skills. When Broadway comedian Frank Fay walked out on a series of feature films teaming him with Billy Gilbert, Gilbert called on his closest friend, Shemp Howard, to replace him in three B-comedy features for Monogram Pictures, filmed in 1944–45. He also played a few serious parts, such as his supporting role in &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; (1942), starring Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne.

===The Three Stooges: 1946–1955===


From 1938 to 1940 and again from 1944 to 1946, Howard appeared in Columbia&#x27;s two-reel comedies, co-starring with Columbia regulars Andy Clyde, The Glove Slingers, El Brendel, and Tom Kennedy. He was given his own starring series in 1944. He was working for Columbia in this capacity when his brother Curly was felled by a debilitating stroke on May 6, 1946. Curly had already suffered a series of strokes prior to the filming of &quot;If a Body Meets a Body&quot; (1945), and in January 1945 Shemp filled in for Curly at a week-long appearance at the St. Charles Theatre in New Orleans.

Shemp agreed to fill in for Curly in Columbia&#x27;s popular Stooge shorts, knowing that if he refused, Moe and Larry would be out of work. He intended to stay only until Curly recovered, which never happened as Curly&#x27;s health continued to worsen. Curly died on January 18, 1952, at the age of 48. Shemp agreed to remain with the group permanently.

Shemp&#x27;s role as the third Stooge was much different from Curly&#x27;s. His characterization was more relaxed as opposed to Curly&#x27;s energetic persona. Unlike Curly, who had many distinct mannerisms, Shemp&#x27;s most notable characteristic as a Stooge was a high-pitched &quot;bee-bee-bee-bee-bee-bee!&quot; sound, a sort of soft screech done by inhaling. It was a multipurpose effect: he emitted this sound when scared, sleeping (done as a form of snoring), overtly happy, or dazed. It became his trademark sound as the &quot;nyuk nyuk&quot; sound had become Curly&#x27;s. Because of his established solo career, he was also given opportunities in the films to do some of his own comic routines.

During this period, The Three Stooges ventured into live television appearances, beginning on Tuesday, October 19, 1948, with Milton Berle on his Texaco Star Theatre program.

Shemp appeared with Moe and Larry in 77 short subjects, four of which were produced posthumously using stock footage. The trio also made the feature film &quot;Gold Raiders&quot; (1951). Shemp suffered a mild stroke in November 1952, but recovered within weeks. The medical episode had no noticeable effect on his remaining films with the Stooges, many of which were remakes of earlier films that also used recycled footage to reduce costs.

==Personal life==
In September 1925, Shemp married Gertrude Frank (1905–1982). They had one child, Morton (1927–1972).

Shemp had several phobias, including of airplanes, automobiles, dogs, and water. According to Moe&#x27;s autobiography, Shemp was involved in a driving accident as a teenager and never obtained a driver&#x27;s license.

==Death==
On November 22, 1955, Shemp went out with associates Al Winston and Bobby Silverman to a boxing match, one of Shemp&#x27;s favorite pastimes, at the Hollywood Legion Stadium. While returning home in a taxi that evening, Shemp died of a massive heart attack, at the age of 60.

Moe&#x27;s autobiography gives a death date of November 23, 1955, which became the date cited by other accounts. Much of that book was finished posthumously by his daughter and son-in-law, and some details were confused. The Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s death certificate states that Shemp Howard died on Tuesday, November 22, 1955, at 11:35 [PM] PST. Howard&#x27;s obituary appeared in the November 23 afternoon editions of Los Angeles newspapers, citing the death on the night of November 22.

Shemp Howard is interred in a crypt in the Indoor Mausoleum at the Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles. His younger brother Curly is also interred there, in an outdoor tomb in the Western Jewish Institute section, as well as his parents Solomon and Jennie Horwitz and older brother Benjamin &quot;Jack&quot;.

==Tributes==
The Three Stooges earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street on August 30, 1983.

==The &quot;Fake Shemps&quot;==

Columbia had promised exhibitors eight Three Stooges comedies for 1956, but only four were completed at the time of Shemp Howard&#x27;s death. To fulfill the contract, producer Jules White manufactured four more shorts &quot;with Shemp&quot; by combining old footage of Howard with new connecting scenes played by a body double (longtime Stooge supporting actor Joe Palma) who is seen mostly from the back. He came to be known by Stooge fans as the &quot;Fake Shemp&quot;, a term which director Sam Raimi later coined in reference to any body double replacing an actor.

These new releases of 1956 are all based on Stooge comedies of 1949. &quot;Rumpus in the Harem&quot; borrows from &quot;Malice in the Palace&quot;; &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; from &quot;Fuelin&#x27; Around&quot;; &quot;Commotion on the Ocean&quot; from &quot;Dunked in the Deep&quot;. The best-received and most technically accomplished of the four is &quot;Scheming Schemers&quot; (1956), combining new footage with recycled clips from &quot;three&quot; old Stooge shorts: &quot;A Plumbing We Will Go&quot; (1940), &quot;Half-Wits Holiday&quot; (1947) and &quot;Vagabond Loafers&quot; (1949).

==Continued popularity==
When it was time to renew the Stooges&#x27;s contract, Columbia hired comedian Joe Besser to replace Shemp. Columbia discontinued filming new Stooge shorts in December 1957 but continued to release them through June 1959. The Stooge shorts were still in demand for kiddie-matinée shows, and their TV revivals boosted the team&#x27;s popularity to an all-time high. Columbia kept the theatrical series going by reissuing Shemp&#x27;s Stooge shorts until 1968.

In the television biopic &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; (2000), Shemp Howard was portrayed by John Kassir.

<doc id="658686" wikidata="Q2497260" url="?curid=658686" title="Sinistral and dextral">
<text>Sinistral and dextral, in some scientific fields, are the two types of chirality (&quot;handedness&quot;) or relative direction. The terms are derived from the Latin words for &quot;left&quot; (&quot;sinister&quot;) and &quot;right&quot; (&quot;dexter&quot;). Other disciplines use different terms (such as dextro- and laevo-rotary in chemistry, or clockwise and anticlockwise in physics) or simply use left and right (as in anatomy).

Relative direction and chirality are distinct concepts. Relative direction is from the point of view of the observer; a completely symmetric object has a left side and a right side, from the observer&#x27;s point of view, if the top and bottom and direction of observation are defined. Chirality, however, is observer-independent: no matter how one looks at a right-hand screw thread, it remains different from a left-hand screw thread. Therefore, a symmetric object has sinistral and dextral directions arbitrarily defined by the position of the observer, while an asymmetric object that shows chirality may have sinistral and dextral directions defined by characteristics of the object, regardless of the position of the observer.

==Biology==
===Gastropods===
Because the coiled shells of gastropods are asymmetric, they possess a quality called chirality–the &quot;handedness&quot; of an asymmetric structure.

Over 90% of gastropod species have shells in which the direction of the coil is dextral (right-handed). A small minority of species and genera have shells in which the coils are almost always sinistral (left-handed). Very few species show an even mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals (for example, &quot;Amphidromus perversus&quot;).

===Flatfish===
The most obvious characteristic of flatfish, other than their flatness, is their asymmetric morphology: both eyes are on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetric than other families.
==Geology==


In geology, the terms sinistral and dextral refer to the horizontal component of the movement of blocks on either side of a fault or the sense of movement within a shear zone. These are terms of relative direction, as the movement of the blocks is described relative to each other when viewed from above. Movement is sinistral (left-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the left, or if straddling the fault the left side moves toward the observer. Movement is dextral (right-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the right, or if straddling the fault the right side moves toward the observer.

<doc id="658700" wikidata="Q410246" url="?curid=658700" title="Lactoferrin">
<text>Lactoferrin (LF), also known as lactotransferrin (LTF), is a multifunctional protein of the transferrin family. Lactoferrin is a globular glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 80 kDa that is widely represented in various secretory fluids, such as milk, saliva, tears, and nasal secretions. Lactoferrin is also present in secondary granules of PMNs and is secreted by some acinar cells. Lactoferrin can be purified from milk or produced recombinantly. Human colostrum (&quot;first milk&quot;) has the highest concentration, followed by human milk, then cow milk (150 mg/L).

Lactoferrin is one of the components of the immune system of the body; it has antimicrobial activity (bacteriocide, fungicide) and is part of the innate defense, mainly at mucoses. It is constantly produced and released into saliva, tears, as well as seminal and vaginal fluid. Lactoferrin provides antibacterial activity to human infants. Lactoferrin interacts with DNA and RNA, polysaccharides and heparin, and shows some of its biological functions in complexes with these ligands. 

Lactoferrin supplements reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections, based on a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. As with any supplements sold online, quality may be an issue because nutritional supplement production quality controls are not subject to the same strict regulatory process as medicines.

==History==
Occurrence of iron-containing red protein in bovine milk was reported as early as in 1939; however, the protein could not be properly characterized because it could not be extracted with sufficient purity. Its first detailed studies were reported around 1960. They documented the molecular weight, isoelectric point, optical absorption spectra and presence of two iron atoms per protein molecule. The protein was extracted from milk, contained iron and was structurally and chemically similar to serum transferrin. Therefore, it was named lactoferrin in 1961, though the name lactotransferrin was used in some earlier publications, and later studies demonstrated that the protein is not restricted to milk. The antibacterial action of lactoferrin was also documented in 1961, and was associated with its ability to bind iron.

==Structure==

===Genes of lactoferrin===
At least 60 gene sequences of lactoferrin have been characterized in 11 species of mammals. In most species, stop codon is TAA, and TGA in &quot;Mus musculus&quot;. Deletions, insertions and mutations of stop codons affect the coding part and its length varies between 2,055 and 2,190 nucleotide pairs. Gene polymorphism between species is much more diverse than the intraspecific polymorphism of lactoferrin. There are differences in amino acid sequences: 8 in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, 6 in &quot;Mus musculus&quot;, 6 in &quot;Capra hircus&quot;, 10 in &quot;Bos taurus&quot; and 20 in &quot;Sus scrofa&quot;. This variation may indicate functional differences between different types of lactoferrin.

In humans, lactoferrin gene &quot;LTF&quot; is located on the third chromosome in the locus 3q21-q23. In oxen, the coding sequence consists of 17 exons and has a length of about 34,500 nucleotide pairs. Exons of the lactoferrin gene in oxen have a similar size to the exons of other genes of the transferrin family, whereas the sizes of introns differ within the family. Similarity in the size of exons and their distribution in the domains of the protein molecule indicates that the evolutionary development of lactoferrin gene occurred by duplication. Study of polymorphism of genes that encode lactoferrin helps selecting livestock breeds that are resistant to mastitis.

===Molecular structure===
Lactoferrin is one of the transferrin proteins that transfer iron to the cells and control the level of free iron in the blood and external secretions. It is present in the milk of humans and other mammals, in the blood plasma and neutrophils and is one of the major proteins of virtually all exocrine secretions of mammals, such as saliva, bile, tears and pancreas. Concentration of lactoferrin in the milk varies from 7 g/L in the colostrum to 1 g/L in mature milk.

X-ray diffraction reveals that lactoferrin is based on one polypeptide chain that contains about 700 amino acids and forms two homologous globular domains named N-and C-lobes. N-lobe corresponds to amino acid residues 1-333 and C-lobe to 345-692, and the ends of those domains are connected by a short α-helix. Each lobe consists of two subdomains, N1, N2 and C1, C2, and contains one iron binding site and one glycosylation site. The degree of glycosylation of the protein may be different and therefore the molecular weight of lactoferrin varies between 76 and 80 kDa. The stability of lactoferrin has been associated with the high glycosylation degree.

Lactoferrin belongs to the basic proteins, its isoelectric point is 8.7. It exists in two forms: iron-rich hololactoferrin and iron-free apolactoferrin. Their tertiary structures are different; apolactoferrin is characterized by &quot;open&quot; conformation of the N-lobe and the &quot;closed&quot; conformation of the C-lobe, and both lobes are closed in the hololactoferrin.

Each lactoferrin molecule can reversibly bind two ions of iron, zinc, copper or other metals. The binding sites are localized in each of the two protein globules. There, each ion is bonded with six ligands: four from the polypeptide chain (two tyrosine residues, one histidine residue and one aspartic acid residue) and two from carbonate or bicarbonate ions.

Lactoferrin forms a reddish complex with iron; its affinity for iron is 300 times higher than that of transferrin. The affinity increases in weakly acidic medium. This facilitates the transfer of iron from transferrin to lactoferrin during inflammations, when the pH of tissues decreases due to accumulation of lactic and other acids. The saturated iron concentration in lactoferrin in human milk is estimated as 10 to 30% (100% corresponds to all lactoferrin molecules containing 2 iron atoms). It is demonstrated that lactoferrin is involved not only in the transport of iron, zinc and copper, but also in the regulation of their intake. Presence of loose ions of zinc and copper does not affect the iron binding ability of lactoferrin, and might even increase it.

===Polymeric forms===
Both in blood plasma and in secretory fluids lactoferrin can exist in different polymeric forms ranging from monomers to tetramers. Lactoferrin tends to polymerize both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;, especially at high concentrations. Several authors found that the dominant form of lactoferrin in physiological conditions is a tetramer, with the monomer:tetramer ratio of 1:4 at the protein concentrations of 10−5 M.

It is suggested that the oligomer state of lactoferrin is determined by its concentration and that polymerization of lactoferrin is strongly affected by the presence of Ca2+ ions. In particular, monomers were dominant at concentrations below 10−10−10−11 M in the presence of Ca2+, but they converted into tetramers at lactoferrin concentrations above 10−9−10−10 M. Titer of lactoferrin in the blood corresponds to this particular &quot;transition concentration&quot; and thus lactoferrin in the blood should be presented both as a monomer and tetramer. Many functional properties of lactoferrin depend on its oligomeric state. In particular, monomeric, but not tetrameric lactoferrin can strongly bind to DNA.

== Function ==
Lactoferrin belongs to the innate immune system. Apart from its main biological function, namely binding and transport of iron ions, lactoferrin also has antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, catalytic, anti-cancer, and anti-allergic functions and properties.

===Enzymatic activity of lactoferrin===
Lactoferrin hydrolyzes RNA and exhibits the properties of pyrimidine-specific secretory ribonucleases . In particular, by destroying the RNA genome, milk RNase inhibits reverse transcription of retroviruses that cause breast cancer in mice. Parsi women in West India have the milk RNase level markedly lower than in other groups, and their breast cancer rate is three times higher than average. Thus, ribonucleases of milk, and lactoferrin in particular, might play an important role in pathogenesis.

===Lactoferrin receptor===
The lactoferrin receptor plays an important role in the internalization of lactoferrin; it also facilitates absorption of iron ions by lactoferrin. It was shown that gene expression increases with age in the duodenum and decreases in the jejunum.
The moonlighting glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been demonstrated to function as a receptor for lactoferrin.

===Bone activity===
Ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin has been used to examine how lactoferrin affects bone. Lactoferrin has shown to have positive effects on bone turnover. It has aided in decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone formation. This was indicated by a decrease in the levels of two bone resorption markers (deoxypyridinoline and N-telopeptide) and an increase in the levels two bone formation markers (osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase). It has reduced osteoclast formation, which signifies a decrease in pro-inflammatory responses and an increase in anti-inflammatory responses which indicates a reduction in bone resorption as well.

===Interaction with nucleic acids===
One of the important properties of lactoferrin is its ability to bind with nucleic acids. The fraction of protein extracted from milk, contains 3.3% RNA,
but, the protein preferably binds to double-stranded DNA rather than single-stranded DNA. The ability of lactoferrin to bind DNA is used for its isolation and purification using affinity chromatography with columns containing immobilized DNA-containing sorbents, such as agarose with the immobilized single-stranded DNA.

==Clinical significance==
===Antibacterial activity===
Lactoferrin&#x27;s primary role is to sequester free iron, and in doing so remove essential substrate required for bacterial growth. Antibacterial action of lactoferrin is also explained by the presence of specific receptors on the cell surface of microorganisms. Lactoferrin binds to lipopolysaccharide of bacterial walls, and the oxidized iron part of the lactoferrin oxidizes bacteria via formation of peroxides. This affects the membrane permeability and results in the cell breakdown (lysis).

Although lactoferrin also has other antibacterial mechanisms not related to iron, such as stimulation of phagocytosis, the interaction with the outer bacterial membrane described above is the most dominant and most studied. Lactoferrin not only disrupts the membrane, but even penetrates into the cell. Its binding to the bacteria wall is associated with the specific peptide lactoferricin, which is located at the N-lobe of lactoferrin and is produced by &quot;in vitro&quot; cleavage of lactoferrin with another protein, trypsin. A mechanism of the antimicrobial action of lactoferrin has been reported as lactoferrin targets H+-ATPase and interferes with proton translocation in the cell membrane, resulting in a lethal effect &quot;in vitro&quot;.

Lactoferrin prevents the attachment of &quot;H. pylori&quot; in the stomach, which in turn, aids in reducing digestive system disorders. Bovine lactoferrin has more activity against &quot;H. pylori&quot; than human lactoferrin.

===Antiviral activity===
Lactoferrin in sufficient strength acts on a wide range of human and animal viruses based on DNA and RNA genomes, including the herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, HIV, hepatitis C virus, hantaviruses, rotaviruses, poliovirus type 1, human respiratory syncytial virus, murine leukemia viruses and Mayaro virus. Activity against COVID-19 has been speculated but not proven.

The most studied mechanism of antiviral activity of lactoferrin is its diversion of virus particles from the target cells. Many viruses tend to bind to the lipoproteins of the cell membranes and then penetrate into the cell. Lactoferrin binds to the same lipoproteins thereby repelling the virus particles. Iron-free apolactoferrin is more efficient in this function than hololactoferrin; and lactoferricin, which is responsible for antimicrobial properties of lactoferrin, shows almost no antiviral activity.

Beside interacting with the cell membrane, lactoferrin also directly binds to viral particles, such as the hepatitis viruses. This mechanism is also confirmed by the antiviral activity of lactoferrin against rotaviruses, which act on different cell types.

Lactoferrin also suppresses virus replication after the virus penetrated into the cell. Such an indirect antiviral effect is achieved by affecting natural killer cells, granulocytes and macrophages – cells, which play a crucial role in the early stages of viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

===Antifungal activity===
Lactoferrin and lactoferricin inhibit &quot;in vitro&quot; growth of &quot;Trichophyton mentagrophytes&quot;, which are responsible for several skin diseases such as ringworm. Lactoferrin also acts against the &quot;Candida albicans&quot; – a diploid fungus (a form of yeast) that causes opportunistic oral and genital infections in humans. Fluconazole has long been used against &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, which resulted in emergence of strains resistant to this drug. However, a combination of lactoferrin with fluconazole can act against fluconazole-resistant strains of &quot;Candida albicans&quot; as well as other types of Candida: &quot;C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis&quot; and &quot;C. tropicalis&quot;. Antifungal activity is observed for sequential incubation of &quot;Candida&quot; with lactoferrin and then with fluconazole, but not vice versa. The antifungal activity of lactoferricin exceeds that of lactoferrin. In particular, synthetic peptide 1–11 lactoferricin shows much greater activity against &quot;Candida albicans&quot; than native lactoferricin.

Administration of lactoferrin through drinking water to mice with weakened immune systems and symptoms of aphthous ulcer reduced the number of &quot;Candida albicans&quot; strains in the mouth and the size of the damaged areas in the tongue. Oral administration of lactoferrin to animals also reduced the number of pathogenic organisms in the tissues close to the gastrointestinal tract. &quot;Candida albicans&quot; could also be completely eradicated with a mixture containing lactoferrin, lysozyme and itraconazole in HIV-positive patients who were resistant to other antifungal drugs. Such antifungal action when other drugs deem inefficient is characteristic of lactoferrin and is especially valuable for HIV-infected patients. Contrary to the antiviral and antibacterial actions of lactoferrin, very little is known about the mechanism of its antifungal action. Lactoferrin seems to bind the plasma membrane of &quot;C. albicans&quot; inducing an apoptotic-like process.

===Anticarcinogenic activity===
The anticancer activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) has been demonstrated in experimental lung, bladder, tongue, colon, and liver carcinogeneses on rats, possibly by suppression of phase I enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Also, in another experiment done on hamsters, bovine lactoferrin decreased the incidence of oral cancer by 50%. Currently, bLF is used as an ingredient in yogurt, chewing gums, infant formulas, and cosmetics.

===Cystic fibrosis===
The human lung and saliva contain a wide range of antimicrobial compound including lactoperoxidase system, producing hypothiocyanite and lactoferrin, with hypothiocyanite missing in cystic fibrosis patients. Lactoferrin, a component of innate immunity, prevents bacterial biofilm development. The loss of microbicidal activity and increased formation of biofilm due to decreased lactoferrin activity is observed in patients with cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis, antibiotic susceptibility may be modified by lactoferrin. These findings demonstrate the important role of lactoferrin in human host defense and especially in lung. Lactoferrin with hypothiocyanite has been granted orphan drug status by the EMEA and the FDA.

===Necrotizing enterocolitis===
Low quality evidence suggests that oral lactoferrin supplementation with or without the addition of a probiotic may decrease late onset of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (stage II or III) in preterm infants with no adverse effects.

===In diagnosis===
Lactoferrin levels in tear fluid have been shown to decrease in dry eye diseases such as Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. A rapid, portable test utilizing microfluidic technology has been developed to enable measurement of lactoferrin levels in human tear fluid at the point-of-care with the aim of improving diagnosis of Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome and other forms of dry eye disease.

==Technology==

===Extraction===
Bovine lactoferrin can be isolated from raw milk, colostrum, or whey using methods such as salt extraction, chromatography, and membrane filtration. Lactoferrin from a variety of species, including humans, can also be produced using transgenic organisms as a recombinant protein.

===Nanotechnology===
Lactotransferrin has been used in the synthesis of fluorescent gold quantum clusters, which has potential applications in nanotechnology.

== Name ==

The name Sayat-Nova has been given several interpretations. One version reads the name as &quot;Lord of Song&quot; (from Arabic &quot;sayyid&quot; and Persian &quot;nava&quot;) or &quot;King of Songs&quot;. Others read the name as grandson (Persian &quot;neve&quot;) of Sayad or hunter (&quot;sayyad&quot;) of song. Charles Dowsett considers all these derivations to be unlikely and proposes the reading New Time (from Arabic &quot;sa&#x27;at&quot; and Russian &quot;nova&quot;) instead.

== Biography ==

Sayat-Nova&#x27;s mother, Sara, was born in Tiflis, and his father, Karapet, either in Aleppo or Adana. He was born in Tiflis. Sayat-Nova was skilled in writing poetry, singing, and playing the kamancheh, Chonguri, Tambur. He lost his position at the royal court when he fell in love with the king&#x27;s sister Ana; he spent the rest of his life as an itinerant bard.

In 1759 he was ordained as a priest in the Armenian Apostolic Church. His wife, Marmar, died in 1768, leaving behind four children. He served in locations including Tiflis and Haghpat Monastery. In 1795 he was killed in Haghpat Monastery by the invading army of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, the Shah of Iran. Agha Mohammad Khan demanded that Sayat Nova convert from Christianity to Islam, which he refused to do, and declaring his religion is undeniably Armenian Christian. Hence he was promptly executed by beheading. He is buried at the Armenian Cathedral of Saint George in Tbilisi.

== Legacy ==

In Armenia, Sayat-Nova is considered a great poet who made a considerable contribution to the Armenian poetry and music of his century. Although he lived his entire life in a deeply religious society, his works are mostly secular and full of romantic expressionism.

About 220 songs have been attributed to Sayat-Nova, although he may have written thousands more. Sayat-Nova also wrote some poems moving between all three.

== In popular culture ==

*The 1969 Armenian film &quot;Sayat Nova&quot; directed by Sergei Parajanov follows the poet&#x27;s path from his childhood wool-dyeing days to his role as a courtier and finally his life as a monk. It was released in the United States under the title &quot;The Color of Pomegranates&quot;. It is not a biography of Sayat Nova, but a series of tableaux vivants of Armenian costume, embroidery and religious rituals depicting scenes and verses from the poet&#x27;s life.

<text>Disinvestment refers to the use of a concerted economic boycott to pressure a government, industry, or company towards a change in policy, or in the case of governments, even regime change. The term was first used in the 1980s, most commonly in the United States, to refer to the use of a concerted economic boycott designed to pressure the government of South Africa into abolishing its apartheid regime. The term has also been applied to actions targeting Iran, Sudan, Northern Ireland, Myanmar, Israel, China and Russia.

==Examples==

===Industries===
* Global Climate Coalition – Ford, General Motors, Texaco, Southern Company, Exxon, and other corporate members of the Global Climate Coalition – an industry group opposing the Kyoto Protocol – were the target of a national disinvestment campaign run by Ozone Action in 2000. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, when Ford Motor Company left the coalition, it was &quot;the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming&quot;. After that, between December, 1999 and early March, 2000, the GCC was deserted by Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, the Southern Company and General Motors. The organization closed in 2002, or in their own words, &#x27;deactivated&#x27;. People associated with the campaign were John Passacantando, who served as the executive director of Ozone Action, and Phil Radford, the then field director of the organization. Both men later served as the executive director of Greenpeace 
* Tobacco industry
* Arms trade
* Fossil fuels industry 

===Environment===

There is a movement to disinvest from coal, oil and gas companies. It is a social movement which urges everyone from individual investors to large endowed institutions to remove their investments (to divest) from publicly listed oil, gas and coal companies, with the intention of combating climate change by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, and holding the oil, gas and coal companies responsible for their role in climate change.

Founder of the movement Bill McKibben, a researcher and academic from University of Victoria, and creator of the webpage 350.org stated: “If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from the wreckage. We believe […] organizations that serve the public good should divest from fossil fuels”

===Companies===
*Talisman Energy - because of its status as the main Western oil company in Sudan in the early 2000s.

===Nations===

====Iran====

Eighteen American states have passed laws requiring the divestment of state pension funds from firms doing business with Iran.

====South Africa====

The most frequently-encountered method of &quot;dis-investing&quot; was to persuade state, county and municipal governments to sell their stock in companies which had a presence in South Africa, such shares having been previously placed in the portfolio of the state&#x27;s, county&#x27;s or city&#x27;s pension fund. Several states and localities did pass legislation ordering the sale of such securities, most notably the city of San Francisco. An array of celebrities, including singer Paul Simon, actively supported the cause.

Many conservatives opposed the disinvestment campaign, accusing its advocates of hypocrisy for not also proposing that the same sanctions be leveled on either the Soviet Union or the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Ronald Reagan, who was the President of the United States during the time the disinvestment movement was at its peak, also opposed it, instead favoring a policy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; with the Pretoria regime. Some offered as an alternative to disinvestment the so-called &quot;Sullivan Principles&quot;, named after Reverend Leon Sullivan, an African-American clergyman who served on the Board of Directors of General Motors. These principles called for corporations doing business in South Africa to adhere to strict standards of non-discrimination in hiring and promotions, so as to set a positive example.

====Northern Ireland====

There was also a less well-publicized movement to apply the strategy of disinvestment to Northern Ireland, as some prominent Irish-American politicians sought to have state and local governments sell their stock in companies doing business in that part of the United Kingdom. This movement featured its own counterpart to the Sullivan Principles; known as the &quot;MacBride Principles&quot; (named for Nobel Peace Prize winner Seán MacBride), which called for American and other foreign companies to take the initiative in nondiscrimination against Roman Catholics by adopting policies resembling affirmative action. The effort to disinvest in Northern Ireland met with little success, but the United States Congress did pass (and then-President Bill Clinton signed) a law requiring American companies with interests there to implement most of the MacBride Principles in 1998.

====Cuba====
Though in place long before the term &quot;disinvestment&quot; was coined, the United States embargo against Cuba meets many of the criteria for designation as such — and a provision more closely paralleling the disinvestment strategy aimed at South Africa was added in 1996, when the United States Congress passed the Helms-Burton Act, which penalized owners of foreign businesses which invested in former American firms that had been nationalized by Fidel Castro&#x27;s government after the Cuban revolution of 1959. The passage of this law was widely seen as a reprisal for an incident in which Cuban military aircraft shot down two private planes flown by Cuban exiles living in Florida, who were searching for Cubans attempting to escape to Miami.

====Sudan====
During the late 1990s and early 2000s several Christian groups in North America campaigned for disinvestment from Sudan because of the Muslim-dominated government&#x27;s long conflict with the breakaway, mostly Christian region of Southern Sudan. One particular target of this campaign was the Canadian oil company, Talisman Energy which eventually left the country, and was supplanted by Chinese investors.

There is currently a growing movement to divest from those that do business with the Sudanese government responsible for genocide in Darfur. Prompted by the State of Illinois – the first government in the US to divest – scores of public and private-sector entities are now following suit. In New York City, Councilman Eric Gioia introduced a resolution to divest City pension funds from companies doing business with Sudan.

The divestment of assets implicated in funding the government of Sudan, in acknowledgment of acts of terrorism and genocide perpetrated in the Darfur conflict. In the United States, this divestment has taken place at the state level (including Illinois, which led the way, followed by New Jersey, Oregon, and Maine). It has also taken place at many North American university endowments, including Cornell University, Harvard University, Case Western Reserve University, Queen&#x27;s University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Amherst College, Yale University, Brown University, the University of California, the University of Pennsylvania, Brandeis University, the University of Colorado, American University, University of Delaware, Emory University, and the University of Vermont.

The Sudan Divestment Task Force has organized a nationwide group which advocates a targeted divestment policy, to minimize any negative effects on Sudanese civilians while still placing financial pressure on the government. The so-called &#x27;targeted divestment approach&#x27; generally permits investment in Sudan, and is thus radically different from the comprehensive divestment that ended apartheid in South Africa.
Under this approach, sponsored by State Senator Jacqueline Collins, public pensions are prohibited from investing in any corporation or private equity firm that conducts business in Sudan, unless authorized to do so by the U.S. Government.

====Israel====
====Russia====

Several companies, such as oil giants BP and Shell, have disinvested from Russia following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. TikTok, also as a result of the invasion, also no longer allows new posts to be published in Russian territory, and YouTube does not allow Russian-backed channels to be monetised on the platform.

====China====

In January 2020, students at University of California, Los Angeles passed a resolution calling for divestment from China. In August 2020, Under Secretary of State Keith Krach called upon university administrators in the United States to divest their endowments from companies in China. In the letter, Krach cited an open letter released nationally in May 2020 by College Democrats and College Republicans that was written by the student-organized Athenai Institute, and numerous other organizations and individuals which called for the disclosure of all ties &quot;between centers of higher learning and all Chinese state agencies and proxies&quot;.

In October 2021, students at The Catholic University of America unanimously passed a resolution, with the Athenai Institute calling upon their university administration to divest its endowment from companies complicit in the genocide of Uyghurs conducted by the Chinese government. This resulted in Catholic University committing to audit and divest its endowment, becoming the first university in the world to do so. According to Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, this action marked the beginning of the &quot;Uyghur Genocide University Divestment Movement&quot;. Following this, the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility at Yale University committed to examine potential investments in Chinese companies tied to human rights abuses. In January 2022, students at Georgetown University circulated an open letter calling for divestment from China. The letter was supported by a coalition of Georgetown&#x27;s College Democrats, College Republicans, Muslim Student Association, Hong Kong Student Association, as well as individuals. Following this, the Georgetown University Student Association introduced and unanimously passed a resolution calling upon the university to divest its endowment. Similar action was taken by a coalition of students at the George Washington University in February 2022.

====Others====
Myanmar (formerly Burma) has also been the target of disinvestment campaigns (most notably the Massachusetts Burma Law initiated by the state of Massachusetts). Divestment campaigns have also been directed against Saudi Arabia due to allegations of &quot;gender apartheid&quot;. The University of California, Riverside&#x27;s Hillel chapter has a Saudi Divestment petition circulating as of 2007.

In 2007, several major international and Canadian oil companies threatened to withdraw investment from the province of Alberta because of a proposed increase in royalty rates.

==Criticism==
Some hold that disinvestment campaigns are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how stock markets work. John Silber, former president of Boston University, observed that while boycotting a company&#x27;s products would actually affect their business, &quot;once a stock issue has been made, the corporation doesn&#x27;t care whether you sell it, burn it, or anything else, because they&#x27;ve already got all the money they&#x27;re ever going to get from that stock. So they don&#x27;t care.&quot;

Regarding the more specific case of South Africa, John Silber recalled:

...when the students were protesting the South African situation, I met with them, and they said BU must disinvest in General Motors and IBM. And I said, &quot;Why should we do that? Is it immoral to own that stock?&quot; Absolutely immoral to own it. And I said, &quot;So then, we&#x27;re supposed to sell it to somebody? We can&#x27;t disinvest unless we sell it to somebody. And if we burn the stock, that just helps General Motors, because it reduces the amount of stock outstanding, so that can&#x27;t be right. If we sell it to somebody, we have just gotten rid of our guilt in order to impose guilt on somebody else.&quot;

One criticism of disinvestment focuses on the belief that institutional selling of a certain stock lowers its market value. Therefore, the company&#x27;s net worth becomes devalued and the owners of the company may lose substantial paper assets. In addition, institutional disinvestment may encourage other investors to sell their stocks for fear of lower prices, which in turn lowers prices even further. Finally, lower stock prices limits a corporation&#x27;s ability to sell a portion of their stocks in order to raise funds to expand the business.

This assumption about the intent behind many disinvestment movements is often incorrect. Disinvestment executions are often forms of denouncement and delegitimization of an industry, such as in the fossil-fuel disinvestment movement. Negative public perception can lead to reform and changes in policy, both privately for the company and in the public sphere.

<doc id="658713" wikidata="Q7647937" url="?curid=658713" title="Sue Hawk">
<text>Susan Hawk (born August 17, 1961) is a truck driver best known for participating in &quot;&quot; (2000) and &quot;&quot; (2004).

==Early life==
Hawk was a truck driver previously residing in Palmyra, Wisconsin, when she first competed on &quot;&quot;. Before then, she owned and managed a hunting and fishing camp in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. She previously was a horse trainer and a bartender-waitress.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;Borneo&quot;===

In &quot;&quot;, Hawk was part of the alliance of the remaining Tagi tribe, which voted out every remaining member of the opposing Pagong tribe after the two tribes merged into one. As four players remained in &quot;Borneo&quot;, she, Richard Hatch, and Rudy Boesch plotted to vote Kelly Wiglesworth out, but the idea was abandoned when Wiglesworth won an Individual Immunity challenge called &quot;Fallen Comrades&quot;, a trivia quiz mini-game about eliminated contestants. At a Tribal Council in the season finale, Hawk and Hatch received two votes each. In a tiebreaker, Hawk and Hatch were disallowed to vote. Boesch and Wiglesworth voted Hawk out, making her overall the thirteenth player voted off and then the sixth jury member of the final Tribal Council, placing fourth. During the final Council, Sue called Richard a &quot;snake&quot; and Kelly a &quot;rat&quot; in her famous speech. Hawk further said that, in Mother Nature, snake would eat a rat. She, as a jury member, further declared to the jury her vote for eventual winner Richard over runner-up Wiglesworth.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===

Hawk re-competed in &quot;&quot; (2004) as part of the Chapera tribe. She was involved in an incident with another former &quot;Borneo&quot; player Richard Hatch, who reappeared in the same season as part of the Mogo Mogo tribe. Hawk later claimed that, during one of tribal immunity challenges, which was a balance beam mini-game, Hatch&#x27;s genitals touched her as he passed her by on the course. The following day, after Hatch was voted out, Hawk resigned from the game voluntarily as she was too upset to continue. Hawk and Hatch discussed the incident in the February 27, 2004, episode of &quot;The Early Show&quot;, the following day after the &quot;Survivor&quot; episode aired the incident.

==Other appearances==
After &quot;Borneo&quot;, Hawk appeared as a guest co-host of &quot;Live with Regis&quot; in September 2000. She also appeared on the fourth episode (2000) of a short-lived American sitcom &quot;DAG&quot;, portraying her first guest-starring role who resembled Hawk on &quot;Survivor&quot; herself especially via dialogue, said its co-creator and executive producer Jack Burditt. A year later, Hawk competed in USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Cannonball Run 2001&quot; teaming with fellow &quot;Survivor&quot; alumnus Jeff Varner (who had placed sixth in then-recently aired in Australia) and Kaya Wittenburg (who had recently appeared in the first season of the similarly-themed reality series &quot;Temptation Island&quot;). The trio, called &quot;The Castaways&quot; placed fourth out of six teams. She also appeared on the fourth season premiere of &quot;Son of the Beach&quot; alongside &quot;Borneo&quot; winner Richard Hatch. Hawk competed in the July 15, 2002, episode (all-reality edition) of a game show &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. She won the &quot;top dog&quot; title and the $25,000 prize against the &quot;dog pound&quot; team.

After &quot;All-Stars&quot;, Hawk also competed alongside other &quot;Survivor&quot; players who were divided into male and female teams in &quot;Family Feud&quot;, aired on the week of February 14, 2005. She also competed in &quot;Battle of the Network Reality Stars&quot; (2005) as part of the &quot;green&quot; team, which lost to the &quot;light blue&quot; team in one challenge and then was eliminated.

==Personal life==
Hawk&#x27;s house and barn are located in Clever, Missouri, as of May 2007. She has been married to her husband since the mid- or late-1980s.

<text>Scopas (; born in Paros, fl. 4th century BCE) was an ancient Greek sculptor and architect, most famous for his statue of Meleager, the copper statue of Aphrodite, and the head of goddess Hygieia, daughter of Asclepius.

==Early life and family==
Scopas was born on the island of Paros. His father was the sculptor Aristander of Paros. Skopas left Paros at an early age and travelled throughout the Hellenic world.

==Career ==
Scopas worked with Praxiteles, and he sculpted parts of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, especially the reliefs. He led the building of the new temple of Athena Alea at Tegea. Similar to Lysippus, Scopas is artistically a successor of the Classical Greek sculptor Polykleitos. The faces of the heads are almost in quadrat. The deeply sunken eyes and a slightly opened mouth are recognizable characteristics in the figures of Scopas.

Works by Scopas are preserved in the British Museum (reliefs) in London; fragments from the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens; the celebrated Ludovisi Ares in the Palazzo Altemps, Rome; a statue of Pothos restored as Apollo Citharoedus in the Capitoline Museum, Rome; and his statue of Meleager, unmentioned in ancient literature but surviving in numerous replicas, perhaps best represented by a torso in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Pothos==

&quot;Pothos&quot;, or &quot;Desire&quot;, was a celebrated and much imitated statue by Scopas. Roman copies featured the human figure with a variety of props, such as musical instruments and fabrics as depicted here, in an example that was in the collection of Cardinal Alessandro Albani.

<text>Sega Rally Championship is a 1995 racing game developed and published by Sega. Originally released for arcades using the Sega Model 2 board, ports were published for the Sega Saturn in 1995 and Microsoft Windows in 1997. The &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; simulates driving on different surfaces, with different friction properties, with the car&#x27;s handling changing accordingly. As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre. It was also an early rally racing game and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual competitive multiplayer.

The music for the arcade game was composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, while the Saturn version&#x27;s soundtrack consisted of a combination of newly composed music by Naofumi Hataya and arrangements of the arcade originals arranged and produced by Takayuki Hijikata, previously released on the album &quot;Sega Rally Championship Ignition&quot;. The game spawned the &quot;Sega Rally&quot; series, in addition to inspiring &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; (1998) and &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage&quot; (2002).

==Gameplay==
The player can enter a &quot;World Championship&quot; mode consisting of three stages: desert (which resembles African savanna), forest (which is based on Yosemite National Park) and mountain (which is in Corsica), where their finishing position at the end of one course is carried through to the starting position of the next course. In this mode, it is impossible to reach first-place position by the end of the first track; thus, the player must try to overtake as many opponent cars as possible on each track (while staying within the time limit), and gain the lead over several tracks. If, at the end of the third stage, the player is in first place, they will advance to the extra fourth stage called &quot;Lakeside&quot; (on the Saturn version, this course may then be played in time attack and split-screen multiplayer modes).

Three cars are featured in the game; Didier Auriol&#x27;s third generation Toyota Celica GT-Four and Juha Kankkunen&#x27;s Lancia Delta HF Integrale which are both available from the start, and Sandro Munari&#x27;s Lancia Stratos HF which is unlocked by finishing Lakeside in first place in the Saturn version of the game, or by using an easter egg in the arcade version. Players are given the option to drive each car in either manual or automatic transmission.

The game supports up to four players using cabinets linked together.

==Development==

&quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; was directed by Kenji Sasaki, a former Namco employee known for his work on &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;. Seeking to develop a racing game that was distinct from the popular arcade titles &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; and &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, Sasaki chose the rally racing subgenre, which he felt was &quot;taboo&quot; in the Japanese gaming community: &quot;We were after something in vogue in terms of motorsport racing and as we were keen on great engine sounds, cool cars and great sensations—the obvious choice was rally&quot;. While the game featured only three cars—the Toyota Celica GT-Four, Lancia Delta Group A, and a hidden Lancia Stratos—it was distinguished by its &quot;stylized handling&quot; and some tuning options. Asked why the developers chose to use the Celica and Delta, team manager Hiroto Kikuchi answered: &quot;We felt that in the rally, we had to use real rally cars and the chosen vehicles were well known and looked good&quot;. Senior programmer Riyuchi Hattori added: &quot;Originally there was talk of using another car from Toyota, but we couldn&#x27;t find a good one. For example, the Supra would have been just the same as the Celica and not much fun to use in the game, so we ended up with just the one. We also took note of the consumers&#x27; opinions, which confirmed that if another car was to be added it should be the Stratos&quot;. According to game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi, they had no experience in driving those cars, but after repeated requests Toyota and Fiat provided feedback for game testing. Fiat also made a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement with the developers allowing the use of official logos and such in &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;; there was no formal sponsorship deal for the game. Mizuguchi&#x27;s car was used to produce the in-game sound of the Lancia Delta&#x27;s engine. While developing the game&#x27;s visual style, the development team spent three weeks driving from the West Coast of the United States to Mexico, taking photographs for use in texture mapping. At one point, Sasaki became deeply worried about &quot;Rally&quot;&#x27;s prospects for success, and even began to question why driving cars was considered &quot;fun&quot;: &quot;I drove up into the mountains with my own car. It was such an enjoyable and exhilarating experience ... This was how the third mountain track in the game was conceived&quot;.

The Sega Saturn version of the game had to be almost completely remade, only referencing the graphics of the arcade version, which required detailed planning. Mizguchi recounted: &quot;Our designers went back to the arcade version and worked out the locations, drew pictures and captured the atmosphere and the feeling of distance. Then there was about two weeks discussion on their work. During this time they worked on the car settings and we had Mr. Yoshio Fujimoto, winner in the Toyota Castrol car to advise it. Then Mr. Nakamura, Mr. Hattori, and Mr. Fujimoto went to the Asian Pacific Indonesian Rally for three days and studied the cars&quot;. Aside from Mizuguchi producing both projects, the Saturn development team was completely different from the original arcade team. Unlike other well-received arcade conversions for the Saturn such as &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; and &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; was developed without using the Sega Graphics Library operating system, as it had not yet been completed when work on the game began. For similar reasons, a split screen was used for multiplayer mode instead of the Saturn link cable; the developers also felt it was important that multiplayer be available to all owners of the Saturn game, not only those who had also purchased a link cable. Finally, the arcade version of &quot;Rally&quot; was designed to be controlled with a steering wheel, and the developers struggled to simulate its drifting techniques using the Saturn&#x27;s controller. The game also supports the Saturn Steering Wheel, though it lacks the haptic feedback of the arcade version&#x27;s steering wheel.

The Sega Saturn version was rushed to the North American market in order to take advantage of the Christmas shopping season. By the time of its release in Japan and Europe, the development team had completed several additional graphical improvements, bug fixes, and front-end options. A version was also released for the Netlink that allowed online play.

==Release==
In Japan, the Sega Saturn version of the game shared the full title of its arcade counterpart, &quot;Sega Rally Championship 1995&quot;, because it was released on December 29, 1995; the year was dropped from the title of the North American and European SegaSaturn version. The European release was scheduled for December 1995, in time for the crucial Christmas shopping season, but it did not appear until the end of the following January.

==Reception and legacy==
===Arcade===
Upon release, the game sold 12,000 arcade units. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their April 1, 1995 issue as being the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the month. It went on to be the second highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1995 in Japan. In the United States, it was one of the top six best-selling arcade games of 1995, receiving the Platinum Award from the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA).

The arcade game was met with positive reviews from critics. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game, stating that &quot;Rally&#x27;s downside is the car&#x27;s indestructibility: no matter how much you slam into either opponents or banks, your racer [...] receives not a scratch, nor can you flip or leave the road [...] And some might say the control is a fault, too; our response? Keep practicing, buddy&quot;.

===Home conversions===
The Sega Saturn version would go on to sell 1.2 million copies. In Japan, &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; topped the charts on release, coming in number 1 during Week 52 in 1995. It was a major system-seller for the system in the United Kingdom, becoming the fastest selling CD game at the time.

The Saturn version was met with almost universally positive reviews. &quot;Next Generation&quot; praised the Saturn version&#x27;s &quot;down-and-dirty feel&quot;, &quot;truly phenomenal high-speed visuals&quot;, and &quot;quick, responsive control&quot;. The magazine cited the game&#x27;s physics and handling as &quot;nothing short of remarkable&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Reiner and Andy gave &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; scores of 8/10 and 8.5/10, making note of technical improvements over the Saturn version of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, which Andy nonetheless felt was the better game. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Paul was more effusive, rating the Saturn port 9.25/10 for its &quot;far better racing feel&quot; and superior graphics to &quot;Daytona&quot;. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; praised the difficulty of unlocking the secret course and secret car, and remarking that &quot;whilst there&#x27;s enough drag, slide action and difficulty wrestling with the controls to convince you the programmers know what it&#x27;s like to drive a rally car, there&#x27;s never so much realism that you&#x27;d have to know how to drive one yourself to play the game&quot;. Later, &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; would rank the game as the second best game on the platform, saying &quot;two years on its release and Sega Rally is still the best racer on a console bar none&quot;.

Both of the sports reviewers for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Saturn version an 8.5 out of 10, saying it &quot;has all of the action and adventure of its arcade cousin. If you were disappointed with &quot;Daytona&quot;, you won&#x27;t be with Sega Rally&quot;. Bruised Lee of &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the additional features of the Saturn version and technical improvements over &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, but criticized that the sounds, while identical to the arcade version, are unexciting compared to other racing games. He said that the power-slide technique can be initially frustrating but once mastered is &quot;effective and fun&quot;. &quot;Maximum&quot; decreed the conversion to be &quot;every bit as good as anyone could have ever hoped&quot;, stating that aside from the frame rate being reduced to 30 frames per second, it is essentially identical to the arcade version. They also complimented the inclusion of a two-player mode, numerous options, and secret modes.

The Windows version was less well received. Critics generally commented that the fun gameplay is still wholly intact, but that the conversion lacks many features standard to PC racing games and suffers from mediocre frame rates except when playing in low-resolution mode, in which case it instead suffers from having lower detail and more pixelation than the Saturn version. Mark Clarkson of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; found the biggest problem was that, being a port of an arcade game, it lacks the longevity expected of a PC game, though he judged it to be fun while it lasted. &quot;Next Generation&quot; concluded that those looking specifically to play &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; on PC would find the version sufficient, but that there were better PC racers available. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Stephen Poole opined that the content of the game was &quot;just not enough&quot;.

===Accolades===
In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed it as number 57 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, citing the &quot;heavier&quot;, more realistic feel of the car when compared to other racing games, and the generally realistic controls. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the game number 1 on their &quot;The GamesMaster Saturn Top 10&quot;. In the same issue, they also rated the game 24th in its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Sega Rally&quot; as number 19 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;one of the best Model 2 games, &quot;Sega Rally&quot; is some of the best fun you can have in a car without having to pretend that you&#x27;ve run out of gas&quot;. &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; was named the best racing game of all time by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine, which ranked it at the top of its &quot;Top 25 Racing Games Ever&quot; list. In &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2009&quot; the Saturn version of the game made it to 44th position in the list of the Top 50 Console Games, due to its &quot;distinct handling style and superb track design&quot;. IGN staff writer Levi Buchanan ranked &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; 6th in his list of the top 10 Sega Saturn games, saying: &quot;Yes, the Dreamcast version is much better and the current-gen sequel... is stunning, but this Saturn arcade port was one of the top reasons to stick by SEGA as it flailed through the 32-bit days&quot;. Some publications and fan-voted lists have considered it to be one of the best games of all time, including &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996, or &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in 1997, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; in 2000, &quot;Edge&quot; in 2007, and NowGamer in 2010. In 2024, The Guardian would rank &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; as the 3rd best Sega arcade game.

===Impact===
The game spawned the &quot;Sega Rally&quot; series, and later followed spiritually by &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage&quot; from the same company, based on the &quot;Initial D&quot; comics and featuring base models of certain rally cars.

In 2010, Codemasters cited &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; as a strong influence on their first &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; game (1998). According to Guy Wilday, producer of the first four &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; games, the &quot;basic premise for the game was based around&quot; &quot;Sega Rally&quot;″s car handling which &quot;remains excellent to this day and it’s still an arcade machine I enjoy playing&quot;.

<text>Le Molay-Littry () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==History==
On 23 January 1969 Le Molay merged with the old commune of Littry to form &quot;Le Molay-Littry&quot;.

Le Molay-Littry has good travel links with neighbouring towns such as Isigny, Bayeux, Saint-Lô, and Balleroy, which served it well in the early 17th century. At that time, the town was a local source of coal which made the town a wealthy one. The town still has a mining museum which is open to the public.

==Chateau du Molay==
The Chateau du Molay was built on the northwest side of town about two and a half centuries ago in 45 acres of wooded grounds.

In 1758, a young Jacques-Jean le Coulteux du Molay (1740–1823), and his wife Geneviéve –Sophie le Coulteux de la Noraye (painted below in 1788); built the chateau, his first large residence, in the heart of Normandy&#x27;s woodland countryside, close to Rouen, his birthplace. Jacques-Jean was a wealthy and well known banker, who had one son (Jacques Félix Le Coulteux du Molay was born Paris 29 June 1779 and died in Dijon 1 April 1812) with Genevieve before their divorce. During their time together they also bought the famous Malmaison near Paris – some of those styles are reflected in the chateau you now stand. Jacques-Jean later married Alexandrine Sophie Pauline Le Couteulx; the couple had three children.

===19th century===
In 1833, Edouard, Count of Chabrol – Crousol, transformed and extended the chateau; giving it the architectural style it has today. The Count of Chabrol – Crousol was a member of the House of Peers, during the reign of Napoleon III. An art collector and avid book – lover, he was the grandfather of the French composer Vincent d&#x27;Indy who died in 1931. Edouard was the prefect of the Seine region of Paris and inaugurated the Palais Brongniart which was built by order of Napoleon Bonaparte to offer a permanent home to the Paris stock exchange in 1826.

At the end of the 19th century, the chateau became the property of the Viellard family.

===World War II===
There followed a sumptuous period of 50 years up to the dark hours of 1940 when the chateau was commandeered by the German Army.

The Balleroy and Molay-Littry area was one of the places where the Germans were setting up V-weapon installations, which though never used, is a fascinating and scary story. The chateau is one of the places were the weapons were planned to be launched from. The devastating V2 weapon was the first ever ballistic missile. It was estimated that by the later stages of the war some 100 rockets per day could have launched. The area and the V-weapons project were under the control of Generalleutnant (General) Dietrich Kraiss and his 352nd Static Infantry Division.

Kraiss was a commander of the 90th Infantry Regiment (from September 1939 to March 1941), 168th Infantry Division (from July 1941 to March 1943) and 355th Infantry Division until May 1943. In November 1943 he took command of the 352nd Infantry Division which was in 1944, with six other divisions, located in Normandy in front of the Allied invasion. His 352nd Infantry Division had 7,400 soldiers and kept defensive positions around St. Lô. He was eventually killed in the fighting of Omaha Beach when one of their own mortars hit him blowing him to pieces. Dietrich Kraiss was born on 16 November 1889 in Stuttgart and died on 2 August 1944 – he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves for his services.

===Tournières===
Tournières is a little village not far from Molay-Littry where U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower established his first HQ in France code-named Shellburst. The success of the landings on 5 June 1944 led the Red Cross, and later the Maquis, to establish themselves here temporarily. Many important meetings took place at Shellburst. 

After the liberation of the area by Allied Forces in early June, engineers of the Ninth Air Force IX Engineering Command began construction of a combat Advanced Landing Ground outside of the town. Declared operational on 25 June, the airfield was designated as &quot;A-9&quot;, it was used by photo-reconnaissance units and various repair and support units until October when it was closed.

===Surrounding area===
A boarding school for girls from Saint–Lo, then a summer camp for Citroen both benefited from its peaceful grounds until 1978. At that time, the chateau was completely renovated and transformed into a three star hotel.
In February 1993, the Chateau du Molay was purchased by Travelbound, an English education travel company owned by specialist travel group Travelopia.

<text>Half Man Half Biscuit are an English rock band, formed in 1984 in Birkenhead, Merseyside. Known for their satirical, sardonic, and sometimes surreal songs, the band comprises lead singer and guitarist Nigel Blackwell, bassist and singer Neil Crossley, drummer Carl Henry, and guitarist Karl Benson.

The band parodies popular genres, while their lyrics allude to UK popular culture and geography. Within a long career, their best-known songs include &quot;The Trumpton Riots&quot; (1986) and &quot;For What Is Chatteris&quot; (2005).

== History ==
Half Man Half Biscuit were formed by two friends from Birkenhead, Neil Crossley and singer, guitarist and songwriter Nigel Blackwell who was (in his own words) at the time &quot;still robbing cars and playing football like normal people do&quot;. In 1979, Blackwell was editing a football fanzine (&quot;Left For Wakeley Gage&quot;); he met Crossley when he went to see the latter&#x27;s band play. In 1984, when Half Man Half Biscuit were formed, Crossley moved to bass and the two were joined by Nigel&#x27;s brother Simon Blackwell (lead guitar) and his friend Paul Wright (drums), both previously with a group called Attempted Moustache, presumably named after the album by Loudon Wainwright III. The quartet started to rehearse in the Liverpool-based Vulcan Studios, where they soon turned a five-piece, with David Lloyd now on keyboards.

Their debut album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Back in the DHSS&quot;, topped the UK Indie Chart and reached number 60 in the UK Albums Chart. Its title was a play on The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; and also a reference to the DHSS, the government department that dealt with the unemployed, Nigel Blackwell having been on unemployment benefits since 1979. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Trumpton Riots&quot;, topped the UK Indies Singles Chart in 1986, and they went on to perform at Glastonbury Festival. The second single, &quot;Dickie Davies Eyes&quot;, also topped the indie chart. In late 1986, the band split up, giving as a reason &quot;musical similarities&quot;. The album &quot;Back Again in the DHSS&quot;, containing previously issued, unreleased and live tracks, followed.

The band reformed in 1990, with a performance at the Reading Festival following, and a new single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Not&quot;, issued before the year was out, followed in 1991 by a collaboration with Margi Clarke on a version of Edith Piaf&#x27;s &quot;No Regrets&quot;. Half Man Half Biscuit were championed by DJ John Peel, for whom they recorded twelve sessions, and it was on his programme in 1990 that the band announced their return. The third album was &quot;McIntyre, Treadmore and Davitt&quot;, released in October 1991. By the time &quot;This Leaden Pall&quot; was released in 1993, Wright and Lloyd had left the band, with Carl Alty joining on drums. Simon Blackwell left the following year, with Ian S. Jackson joining. Jackson (who later joined Rooney) and Alty (who joined Joyrider) departed in 1996, to be replaced by Ken Hancock (guitar) and Carl Henry (drums).
In April 2010, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Joy Division Oven Gloves&quot; from their 2005 album &quot;Achtung Bono&quot; was the subject of a Facebook campaign to get it to No. 6 on the chart for 12 April 2010, in response to the rumoured closure of the indie-supporting radio station BBC 6 Music. The song reached No. 56 on 11 April 2010: this was their first UK Singles Chart appearance. It also reached No. 3 in the Official Independent Singles chart the same week, and was No. 1 in the HMV UK Digital Downloads Top 40 Tracks on 16 April, knocking Ultravox&#x27;s song &quot;Vienna&quot; off the top spot – itself part of a separate Facebook campaign the previous week.

== Reception ==
Andy Kershaw described Half Man Half Biscuit as &quot;One of England&#x27;s most amazing bands&quot; and &quot;the most authentic British folk band since The Clash&quot;. James Dodd on &quot;Bido Lito!&quot; praised (as many others did) Blackwell&#x27;s &quot;uncanny way of chronicling two of his greatest passions in life: television and small-town England&quot;. Eliza Carthy praised the band for their &quot;pathos disguised with wit and sarcasm&quot;, describing Blackwell as a &quot;genius&quot;. Journalist Ben Myers has described Blackwell&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;the antithesis of most rock songs, and iconoclastic in their total avoidance of cliche&quot;.

Geoff Davies of Probe Plus recalled that after hearing a test pressing of &quot;Back in the D.H.S.S&quot;, John Peel said &quot;Geoff, what&#x27;s this, I&#x27;ve just played the first side of this, what is it, tell me, it&#x27;s just fantastic and all&quot;. Other famous Peel quotes about the band include &quot;I&#x27;ve said it before, a national treasure, there&#x27;s no question about it. When I die, I want them to be buried with me.&quot; (14 August 1996) and &quot;In a decently ordered society, members of Half Man Half Biscuit would be routinely carried shoulder high through the streets of every city they visited&quot; (10 July 1997).

According to music writer Paul Du Noyer: &quot;The genius of Half Man Half Biscuit is that they took just enough of Scouse culture to give themselves an edge, but kept their distance too. From their Wirral bastion they issue occasional dispatches of wry hilarity and downbeat, satirical bite. The songs of their leader, Nigel Blackwell, suggest a very real world of people too educated to be on the dole but too luckless or lazy to be anywhere else. They take a witty revenge on the drivel of popular culture, without denying their fascination with it. They seem flintily incorruptible, and scan the London music media with a mocking eye for cant.&quot; English writer Julie Burchill praised their &quot;supremely clever and funny lyrics&quot;, and described the band as &quot;punk with a sense of humour and a sense of perspective&quot;.

References to Half Man Half Biscuit can be found on episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;Brookside&quot;, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, Men Behaving Badly and &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, as well as an episode of &quot;Football Focus&quot; and the BBC serial &quot;Elidor&quot;. The cricket commentator David &#x27;Bumble&#x27; Lloyd often makes reference to songs and lyrics in commentaries, often completely lost on other commentators working with him.

<doc id="658749" wikidata="Q4476379" url="?curid=658749" title="Mobility management">
<text>Mobility management is one of the major functions of a GSM or
a UMTS network that allows mobile phones to work. The aim of mobility management is to track where the subscribers are, allowing calls, SMS and other mobile phone services to be delivered to them.

==Location update procedure==
A GSM or UMTS network, like all cellular networks, is basically a radio network of individual cells, known as base stations. Each base station covers a small geographical area which is part of a uniquely identified location area. By integrating the coverage of each of these base stations, a cellular network provides a radio coverage over a much wider area. For GSM, a base station is called a base transceiver station (BTS), and for UMTS it is called a Node B. A group of base stations is named a location area, or a routing area.

The location update procedure allows a mobile device to inform the cellular network whenever it moves from one location area to the next. Mobiles are responsible for detecting location area codes (LAC). When a mobile finds that the location area code is different from its last update, it performs another update by sending to the network, a location update request, together with its previous location, and its Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI).

The mobile also stores the current LAC in the SIM card, concatenating it to a list of recently used LACs. This is done to avoid unnecessary IMSI attachment procedures in case the mobile has been forced to switch off (by removing the battery, for example) without having a chance to notify the network with an IMSI detach and then switched on right after it has been turned off. Considering the fact that the mobile is still associated with the Mobile Switching Center/Visitor Location Register (MSC/VLR) of the current location area, there is no need for any kind of IMSI attachment procedures to be done.

There are several reasons why a mobile may provide updated location information to the network. Whenever a mobile is switched on or off, the network may require it to perform an IMSI attach or IMSI detach location update procedure. Also, each mobile is required to regularly report its location at a set time interval using a &quot;periodic location update&quot; procedure. Whenever a mobile moves from one location area to the next while not on a call, a &quot;random location&quot; update is required. This is also required of a stationary mobile that reselects coverage from a cell in a different location area, because of signal fade. Thus, a subscriber has reliable access to the network and may be reached with a call, while enjoying the freedom of mobility within the whole coverage area.

When a subscriber is paged in an attempt to deliver a call or SMS and the subscriber does not reply to that page then the subscriber is marked as absent in both the MSC/VLR and the Home Location Register (HLR) (Mobile not reachable flag MNRF is set). The next time the mobile performs a location update, the HLR is updated and the mobile not reachable flag is cleared.

==TMSI==
The Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) is the identity that is most commonly sent between the mobile and the network. Depending on the necessary precision, a TMSI may be set by a VLR, SGSN, or MME. In the least-precise case, TMSI is randomly assigned by the VLR to every mobile in the area, the moment it is switched on, in order to support identity confidentiality. The number is local to a location area, and so it has to be updated each time the mobile moves to a new geographical area.

The VLR, SGSN, and MME must be capable of correlating an allocated TMSI with the IMSI of the MS to which it is allocated. An MS may be allocated three TMSIs; one for services provided through the MSC (the TMSI), one for services provided through the SGSN (the packet-TMSI or P-TMSI), and one for the services provided the MME (the MME-TMSI or M-TMSI; a part of the GUTI).

The network can also change the TMSI of the mobile at any time. And it normally does so, in order to avoid the subscriber from being identified, and tracked by eavesdroppers on the radio interface. This makes it difficult to trace which mobile is which, except briefly, when the mobile is just switched on, or when the data in the mobile becomes invalid for one reason or another. At that point, the global &quot;international mobile subscriber identity&quot; (IMSI) must be sent to the network. The IMSI is sent as rarely as possible, to avoid it being identified and tracked.

A key use of the TMSI is in paging a mobile. &quot;Paging&quot; is the one-to-one communication between the mobile and the base station. The most important use of broadcast information is to set up channels for &quot;paging&quot;. Every cellular system has a broadcast mechanism to distribute such information to a plurality of mobiles.

Size of TMSI is 4 octet with full hex digits but can&#x27;t be all &quot;FF&quot; because the SIM uses 4 octets with all bits equal to 1 to indicate that no valid TMSI is available.

==Roaming==
Roaming is one of the fundamental mobility management procedures of all cellular networks. Roaming is defined as the ability for a cellular customer to automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data, or access other services, including home data services, when travelling outside the geographical coverage area of the home network, by means of using a visited network. This can be done by using a communication terminal or else just by using the subscriber identity in the visited network. Roaming is technically supported by a mobility management, authentication, authorization and billing procedures.

==Types of area==
===Location area===
A &quot;location area&quot; is a set of base stations that are grouped together to optimize signaling. Typically, tens or even hundreds of base stations share a single Base Station Controller (BSC) in GSM, or a Radio Network Controller (RNC) in UMTS. The BSC / RNC is the intelligence behind the base stations; it handles allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from the mobile phones, and controls handovers between base stations.

Each location area has an assigned unique identifier, made up of numbers, called a &quot;location area code&quot; (LAC). The LAC is broadcast by each base station at regular intervals. Within a location area, each base station is assigned a distinct &quot;cell identifier&quot; (CI) number, see also Cell Global Identity.

If the location areas are large and moderately populated, there will likely be a high number of mobiles operating simultaneously, resulting in very high paging traffic. This is due to the fact that every paging request has to be broadcast to every base station in the location area. Ultimately, this wastes bandwidth and power on mobile devices by requiring them to listen for broadcast messages too often. Similarly if on the other hand, there are too many small location areas, the mobile device must contact the network very often for changes of location, which will also drain the device’s battery. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between the size of the location area and the number of mobile device users in the location area.

===Routing area===
The routing area is the packet-switched domain equivalent of the location area. A &quot;routing area&quot; is normally a subdivision of a &quot;location area&quot;. Routing areas are used by mobiles which are GPRS-attached. GPRS is optimized for &quot;bursty&quot; data communication services, such as wireless internet/intranet, and multimedia services. It is also known as GSM-IP (&quot;Internet Protocol&quot;) because it will connect users directly to Internet Service Providers

The bursty nature of packet traffic means that more paging messages are expected per mobile, and so it is worth knowing the location of the mobile more accurately than it would be with traditional circuit-switched traffic. A change from routing area to routing area (called a &quot;Routing Area Update&quot;) is done in an almost identical way to a change from location area to location area. The main differences are that the &quot;Serving GPRS Support Node&quot; (SGSN) is the element involved.

===Tracking area===
The tracking area is the LTE counterpart of the location area and routing area. A tracking area is a set of cells. Tracking areas can be grouped into lists of tracking areas (TA lists), which can be configured on the User Equipment (UE). Tracking area updates are performed periodically or when the UE moves to a tracking area that is not included in its TA list.

Operators can allocate different TA lists to different UEs. This can avoid signaling peaks in some conditions: for instance, the UEs of passengers of a train may not perform tracking area updates simultaneously.

On the network side, the involved element is the Mobility Management Entity (MME). MME configures TA lists using NAS messages like Attach Accept, TAU Accept or GUTI Reallocation Command.

<doc id="658766" wikidata="Q55095" url="?curid=658766" title="La Condamine">
<text>La Condamine (; ) is the central ward and a quartier in the Principality of Monaco. The quartier&#x27;s landmarks include Port Hercules, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium, and the Princess Antoinette Park. Its farmers&#x27; market, at &quot;Place d&#x27;Armes,&quot; has been held since 1880.

== Toponymy ==
Its current name comes from the vulgar Latin &quot;*condominium&quot; that designated in the Middle Ages a land, near the castle, reserved for the feudal lord and exempt from taxes, or sometimes a land subject to two lords at the same time.

==History==

The Monegasque constitution of 1911 created three communes: La Condamine was then one of the three communes of the Principality. It is there that Fernand Forest died in 1914. A single commune was re-established in 1918.

===Legends===
Saint Devote was martyred in Corsica in the 3rd century. According to tradition, the boat that was to carry her body to the African land was caught in a storm; a dove then guided her to the European shore and landed in Monaco. In the Middle Ages, the relics of the saint were stolen and taken away by boat. When the criminals were caught, their boat was burned. This is the origin of the ceremony which is celebrated on January 26 each year and during which a boat is burnt on the square in front of the votive church. The next day an imposing procession takes place.

==Geography==
The district occupies a small valley which was crossed by the railway viaduct (today the railway passes through a tunnel) which has become a road linking the district and Monte Carlo.

==Overview==
&quot;Condamine&quot; dates from the Middle Ages, and means cultivable land. It is the second oldest area of Monaco, after Monaco-Ville. Its location between Monaco-Ville and Monte Carlo provides residents and visitors easy access to both: in the early 20th century travel writers recommended its hotels as &quot;much cheaper than those at Monte Carlo&quot; while also as close to the &quot;old city&quot; (Monaco-Ville) as a tourist could stay, because Monaco-Ville has no hotels. The late 19th century official princely archivist Gustave Saige described it as the culmination of the &quot;small semicircular&quot; Port Hercule, &quot;inclined amphitheatrically towards it.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Allen&quot; (DD-66) was a destroyer of the United States Navy launched in 1916. She was the second Navy ship named for Lieutenant William Henry Allen (1784–1813), a naval officer during the War of 1812. She was the longest-serving destroyer on the Naval Vessel Register when she was sold in 1946 and was one of the few US Navy ships completed during World War I to serve in World War II.

==Construction and design==
The construction of six destroyers of the for the US Navy was authorized in June 1914, with a contract being signed with Bath Iron Works for the construction of USS &quot;Allen&quot; on 30 January 1915. &quot;Allen&quot; was laid down by Bath Iron Works at their Bath Maine shipyard and was launched on 5 December 1916, sponsored by Miss Dorothea Dix Allen and Miss Harriet Allen Butler, and commissioned on 24 January 1917, Lieutenant Commander Samuel W. Bryant in command. Final delivery from Bath Iron Works was recorded as 22 October 1917, per the official records of the Bath Iron Works Company. (record Number 68). Construction cost was $816,185.43 for hull and machinery.

&quot;Allen&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was standard and full load. Four Normand three-drum water tube boilers supplied saturated steam at to two sets of Parsons steam turbines rated at . A geared cruising turbine was fitted which could drive the port propeller shaft. Design speed was , with a speed of reached during sea trials.

The ship was armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) 50-calibre guns, with two 1-pounder (37 mm) pom-pom autocannon providing anti-aircraft protection. Four treble mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. Crew was 136 officers and other ranks during wartime and 103 during peacetime.

By 1930, &quot;Allen&quot;″s pom-poms had been replaced by a single 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun. &quot;Allen&quot; was rearmed during World War II for escort operations, with two triple torpedo-tube mounts being removed to accommodate depth charge projectors and six Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.

==Service history==

===World War I===

In the five months after commissioning, &quot;Allen&quot; conducted patrol and escort duty along the eastern seaboard of the US and in the West Indies, continuing these duties following the United States entering World War I on the side of the Allies on 6 April. On the night of 30 April/1 May 1917, &quot;Allen&quot; was escorting the battleship when she collided with the destroyer , damaging both ships. On 14 June, the destroyer put to sea from New York in the escort of one of the first convoys to take American troops to Europe. After seeing the convoy safely across the Atlantic, &quot;Allen&quot; joined other American destroyers at Queenstown, Ireland, and began duty patrolling against U-boats and escorting convoys on the last leg of their voyage to Europe under the command of Commander Henry D. Cooke. Cooke was later awarded with the Navy Cross for his leadership of USS &quot;Allen&quot;.

That duty included escort missions into both French and British ports. During her service at Queenstown, she reported engagements with German submarines on 10 separate occasions, but postwar checks of German records failed to substantiate even the most plausible of the supposed encounters.

On 14 July 1917, &quot;Allen&quot; was escorting the merchant ships SS &quot;Rhesus&quot; and SS &quot;Idomeneus&quot; when &quot;Rhesus&quot; was missed by a torpedo, possibly from the German submarine or . One of the last duties the destroyer performed in European waters came in December 1918 when she helped to escort , with President Woodrow Wilson embarked, into Brest, France, on the 13th. Following that mission, the destroyer returned to Queenstown, whence she departed on the day after Christmas, bound for home. &quot;Allen&quot; pulled into New York on 7 January 1919.

===Inter-War Period===
After voyage repairs, the destroyer resumed duty along the East Coast and in the West Indies with the United States Atlantic Fleet. That duty continued until 22 June 1922, at which time she was placed out of commission, in reserve. She was placed back in commission three years later, on 23 June 1925. &quot;Allen&quot; spent almost three years as a training platform for naval reservists at Washington, D.C. In March 1928, the destroyer returned to the Reserve Fleet and was berthed at Philadelphia. There, she remained for more than 12 years. On 23 August 1940, &quot;Allen&quot; was recommissioned at Philadelphia.

===World War II===
Following a brief period of service on the United States East Coast, &quot;Allen&quot; was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet as a unit of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 80. By the time &quot;Allen&quot; returned to commission, the Pacific Fleet had been moved from its base on the United States West Coast to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii as a gesture to &quot;restrain&quot; the Japanese. Therefore, &quot;Allen&quot; moved to the Hawaiian base, whence she operated until the beginning of hostilities between the United States and Japan.

On the morning of 7 December 1941, &quot;Allen&quot; was moored in East Loch to the northeast of Ford Island and just southeast of the hospital ship . During the Japanese attack on the harbor that morning, it was claimed that &quot;Allen&quot; assisted in downing three enemy planes.

Following the attack, &quot;Allen&quot; began duty escorting ships between islands of the Hawaiian chain and patrolling the area for enemy ships, primarily submarines. A primary training function of &quot;Allen&quot; during this period was to work up new submarine crews in penetrating ASW defensive positions, with &quot;Allen&quot; acting as the defender. This task is recorded in several histories of US submarine operations in the Pacific as their first actual action against a ship. On 4 June 1942, &quot;Allen&quot; was given orders to escort the submarine to Midway Island. Upon arriving &quot;Allen&quot; was put into a defensive role, and provided anti-air defense and screens for other ships and aided in the defense of Midway Island itself. Although &quot;Allen&quot; did not have a major impact in the Battle of Midway &quot;Allen&quot; survived the encounter and returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 June. &quot;Allen&quot; also made periodic round-trip voyages to the United States West Coast. Such duty remained her occupation throughout World War II.

In September 1945, &quot;Allen&quot; steamed from Hawaii to Philadelphia, where she was placed out of commission on 15 October 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 November 1945, and she was sold to the Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland, on 26 September 1946 for scrapping. Being in service prior to the US entry into World War I, and serving through World War II, &quot;Allen&quot; was the longest-serving destroyer on the Naval Register when she was sold.

<doc id="658771" wikidata="Q2457525" url="?curid=658771" title="Unplugged (The Corrs album)">
<text>The Corrs Unplugged is the third album (and the first visual recording) by Irish band The Corrs, filmed and released in the fall of 1999. The album is part of the iconic &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; series, which features musicians performing in a more acoustic, “stripped-down” concert setting. Initially, the album was released internationally, albeit not in the United States until a year later, after the band had experienced further success with their single “Breathless” and their fourth album &quot;In Blue&quot;, with both releases earning them their highest chart positions to-date in the US.

The “MTV Unplugged” session was recorded with a small, invitation-only audience, and features the Irish Film Orchestra accompanying the band on most of their songs. The album was recorded live on at Ardmore Studios, Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland, and was released on CD, MiniDisc, DVD, VCD and VHS. The compact-disc version features the songs in a somewhat different order to that in which they were actually performed, and the Fleetwood Mac cover “Dreams” was strangely omitted from the CD (but featured as a bonus track on some releases). The DVD and VHS retains the original song order, and is mostly unedited, while the CD edits out almost all of the talking and introductions between songs.

In addition to The Corrs’ familiar songs, plus two Irish tunes from their debut album (“Toss the Feathers”, “Lough Erin Shore”), the “Unplugged” album features several new songs. The band performed a heartfelt version of the R.E.M. song “Everybody Hurts”, as well as debuting two unreleased compositions: the songs “Radio” and “At Your Side”, with lyrics by Sharon Corr, would eventually go on to be re-recorded and featured on their album &quot;In Blue&quot;, the following year. The Jimi Hendrix song “Little Wing” features a stellar steel guitar solo by the band’s longtime guitarist, Anto Drennan. The Irish peace-themed duet &quot;No Frontiers&quot; was sung by Sharon and Caroline—who typically play violin and drums, respectively—during their Talk on Corners World Tour European leg in 1998 and 99, and subsequently included on “Unplugged”. The song was originally recorded by Mary Black on her album of the same name (written by Jimmy MacCarthy). The band also performed a rendition of “Old Town” by Phil Lynott.

<text>Monaco City ( ; ) is the southcentral ward in the Principality of Monaco. Located on a headland that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, it is nicknamed The Rock (; ). The name &quot;Monaco City&quot; is misleading: it is not itself a city, but a historical and statistical district. It holds most of the country&#x27;s political and judicial institutions: the Prince&#x27;s Palace, the town hall, the government, the National Council (parliament of Monaco), the Municipal Council, the courts and a prison (hanging on The Rock).

==Geography==
Monaco City is one of the four traditional quarters () of Monaco; the others are La Condamine, Monte Carlo, and Fontvieille. It is located at and has an estimated population of 975. It has 19.64 hectares of surface and is located between the districts of Fontvieille and La Condamine.

==History==
Monaco Ville was originally called in Greek Monoikos, after the temple of &quot;Hercules Monoikos&quot;, located in a Phocaean colony of the 6th century BCE. During its history, Monoikos changed hands numerous times. It became &quot;Monaco&quot; in the Middle Ages. Some of the city walls and original structures still remain.

It was here that the Phocaeans of Massalia (now Marseille) founded the colony of Monoïkos in the 6th century BC. Monoikos was associated with Hercules, who was worshipped as Hercules Monoecus. According to the works of Hercules, but also according to Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo, the Greeks and the Ligurians reported that Hercules had passed through the region.

On 10 June 1215, a detachment of Ghibellines led by Fulco del Cassello began the construction of a fortress on the rock of Monaco in order to make it a strategic military position and a means of controlling the area.

They also established dwellings at the base of the Rock to support the garrisons. To attract the inhabitants of Genoa and the surrounding towns, they offered land and exempted newcomers from taxes.

On January 8, 1297, François Grimaldi, descendant of Otto Canella, consul of Genoa in 1133, took over the fortress. Although he had a small army, he disguised himself as a Franciscan friar to enter, before opening the gates to his soldiers. This episode gave rise to his nickname, Malizia (&quot;malice&quot;). This is why today the arms of Monaco bear two Franciscans armed with a sword.

==Landmarks==
Despite being located in the middle of the City of Monaco, the world&#x27;s most densely populated urban center, Monaco City remains a medieval village at heart, made up almost entirely of quiet pedestrian streets and marked by virtual silence after sundown. Though innumerable people visit Monaco City and the palace square, only local vehicles are allowed up to the Rock, and gasoline-powered motorcycles are prohibited after 10 p.m.

*Prince&#x27;s Palace of Monaco. The colorful changing of the guard occurs every day outside the &quot;Palais&quot; at 11:55 a.m.
*Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate (), a Romanesque-Byzantine Catholic church that contains the remains of many members of Monaco&#x27;s ruling family.
*The Oceanographic Museum, established by Albert I, Prince of Monaco in 1910.
*Chapel of Mercy, built in 1639, one of the oldest buildings in the principality. It is famous for being the starting point of a torchlit religious procession by local residents that takes place on the eve of Good Friday each year.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-11 (NATO reporting name: Fishpot-C) is an interceptor aircraft used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

==Design and development==
The Su-11 was an upgraded version of the Sukhoi Su-9 (&#x27;Fishpot&#x27;) interceptor, which had been developed in parallel with the OKB&#x27;s swept wing Su-7 fighter bomber. Recognizing the Su-9&#x27;s fundamental limitations, Sukhoi began work on the Su-11, which first flew in 1961 as the T-47 prototype.

The Su-11 shared the Su-9&#x27;s delta wing, swept tailplanes and cigar-shaped fuselage, as well as the circular nose intake, but had a longer nose to accommodate the more powerful &#x27;Oryol&#x27; (&quot;Eagle&quot;; NATO reporting name &#x27;Skip Spin&#x27;) radar set. A more powerful Lyulka AL-7F-1 turbojet was installed, providing 9.8 kN (2,210 lbf) more afterburning thrust for improved climb rate and high-altitude performance (and to compensate for increased weight). The Su-11 can be distinguished from the Su-9 by the external fuel pipes atop the fuselage, aft of the cockpit.

The Su-9&#x27;s beam-riding K-5 missiles were replaced by a pair of R-98 (AA-3 &#x27;Anab&#x27;) weapons, usually one R-98MR semi-active radar homing and one R-98MT infrared guided. Like many interceptors of the period, it had no cannon.

Production of the definitive Su-11-8M began in 1962, ended in 1965, after about 108 aircraft had been delivered, although it is believed that at least some Su-9s were upgraded to Su-11 form.

A conversion trainer version, the Su-11U &#x27;Maiden,&#x27; was also developed; Similar to the Su-9U, it had full armament and radar systems for training purposes, but the second seat reduced its already marginal fuel capacity and was not intended for combat use.

==Operational history==
Development problems and accidents delayed squadron introduction with the Soviet Air Force (VVS)/ Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) until 1964 and only small number of aircraft were delivered.

Even with the superior radar, the Su-11 remained heavily dependent on ground control interception (GCI) to vector its pilot onto targets. It had no capability against low-flying aircraft either, and Sukhoi OKB considered the Su-11 to be a misfire, much inferior to the far more formidable Su-15 (&#x27;Flagon&#x27;). Nevertheless, a few examples remained operational until the early 1980s. The last Su-11s left front-line service around 1983.

<doc id="658780" wikidata="Q210991" url="?curid=658780" title="Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)">
<text>The Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1785. The first performance took place at the Mehlgrube Casino in Vienna on 11 February 1785, with the composer as the soloist.

==Background==
A few days after the first performance, the composer&#x27;s father, Leopold, visiting in Vienna, wrote to his daughter Nannerl about her brother&#x27;s recent success: &quot;[I heard] an excellent new piano concerto by Wolfgang, on which the copyist was still at work when we got here, and your brother didn&#x27;t even have time to play through the rondo because he had to oversee the copying operation.&quot;

The concerto is written in the key of D minor. Other works by the composer in that key include the Fantasia K. 397 for piano, the Requiem, a Kyrie, a mass, the aria &quot;Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen&quot; from the opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and parts of the opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. It is the first of two Mozart piano concertos written in a minor key (No. 24 in C minor being the other).

The young Ludwig van Beethoven admired this concerto and kept it in his repertoire. Composers who wrote cadenzas for it include Beethoven (WoO 58), Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart, Charles-Valentin Alkan, Johannes Brahms (WoO 14), Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Ferruccio Busoni, and Clara Schumann. However, Beethoven&#x27;s cadenza remained the most commonly performed.

One of Mozart&#x27;s favorite pianos that he played while he was living in Vienna had a pedal-board that was operated with the feet, like that of an organ. This piano that Mozart owned is on display at Mozart House in Salzburg, but currently it has no pedal-board. The fact that Mozart had a piano with a pedal-board is reported in a letter written by his father, Leopold, who visited his son while he lived in Vienna. Among Mozart&#x27;s piano works, none are explicitly written with a part for a pedal-board. However, according to Leopold&#x27;s report, at the first performance of Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor (K. 466), Mozart, who was the soloist and conductor, used his own piano, equipped with a pedal-board. Presumably the pedal-board was used to reinforce the left-hand part, or add lower notes than the standard keyboard could play. Because Mozart was also an expert on the organ, operating a pedal-board with his feet was no harder than using only his hands.

== Movements ==
The concerto is scored for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.

As is typical with concertos, it is in three movements:

=== I. Allegro ===

The first movement starts off the concerto in the tonic key of D minor with the strings restlessly but quietly building up to a full &quot;forte&quot;. Music critic Michael Steinberg calls this opening as &quot;all atmosphere and gesture–no theme&quot;. It is then followed by the second theme, played by the woodwinds before being overtaken by the tutti orchestra.

The solo piano then introduces a new theme, whose construction is described by Robert Levin as &quot;a masterful balance of expressive and narrative detail&quot;. A slightly brighter mood exists in the second theme of F major (the relative major), but it never becomes jubilant. The timpani further heighten the tension in the coda before the cadenza starts. The movement ends on a quiet note.

=== II. Romance Adagio ===
The Romanze second movement, in B major, is a five-part rondo (ABACA) with a coda. The trumpets and timpani are not used in this movement. The beginning features a solo piano playing the flamboyant and charming main B major melody without accompaniment. This lyrical, passionate, tender and romantic melody paints a picture of peace and a sense of harmony between the piano and the orchestra and has also inspired its title &#x27;Romanze&#x27;.

Halfway through, the piece moves on to the second episode (part C), where instead of the beautiful melody, a storm sets in. The new stormy material is a turbulent, agitated and ominous theme, in the relative key of G minor, which greatly contrasts with the peaceful mood at the starting of the movement. Though the storm section begins abruptly and without transition, after a transition back to the tonic key of B major we are greeted once again with the previously heard melody, which returns as the movement is nearing its end. The movement ends with an ascending arpeggio that is light and delicate, gradually becoming a faint whisper.

=== III. Rondo, Allegro assai ===
The final movement, a rondo, begins with the solo piano rippling upward in the home key before the full orchestra replies with a furious section. (This piano &quot;rippling&quot; is known as the Mannheim Rocket and is a string of eighth notes (D–F–A–D–F) followed by a quarter note (A)). A second melody is touched upon by the piano, where the mood is still dark but strangely restless. A contrasting cheerful melody in F major is ushered in not long after, introduced by the orchestra before the solo piano rounds off the lively theme. A series of sharp piano chords snaps the bright melody, and then begin passages in D minor for solo piano again, afterwards taken up by full orchestra. Several modulations of the second theme (in A minor and G minor) follow. Thereafter follows the same format as above, with a momentary pause for introducing the customary cadenza.

After the cadenza, the mood clears considerably and the piece is now fully sunny in character, as we are now in the parallel key of D major, and the bright happy melody is taken up, this time by the oboes and then winds. The solo piano repeats the theme before a full orchestral passage develops the passage, thereby ending the concerto.

The first movement was played in the ballet scene in Series 1 Episode 8 of the television series &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;. It is a theme in American composer James Hewitt’s Medley Overture in D minor-major.

The 1984 feature film &quot;Amadeus&quot; makes use of the first movement when Mozart is stumbling home after an evening with Emanuel Schikaneder during a night of composing the score of his opera &quot;The Magic Flute.&quot; The second movement (minus the more tumultuous C part of the rondo) plays in the final scene and during the end credits.

<text>Robert Knight Morgan (July 31, 1918 – May 15, 2004) was a colonel and a Command Pilot in the United States Air Force from Asheville, North Carolina. During World War II, while a captain in the United States Army Air Forces, Morgan was a bomber pilot with the 8th Air Force in the European theater and the aircraft commander of the famous B-17 Flying Fortress, &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;, flying 25 missions. After completing his European tour, Morgan flew another 26 combat missions in the B-29 Superfortress against Japan in the Pacific Theater.

==Biography==
Morgan graduated from Christ School, an all-boys preparatory school in Arden, North Carolina, in 1936. He attended the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania and entered the Army Air Corps in 1940. He earned his pilot wings and was commissioned a second lieutenant on December 12, 1941, then after advanced training at Walla Walla Army Air Base, Washington, was assigned to the 324th Bomb Squadron, 91st Bomb Group (RAF Bassingbourn approximately 3 mi (5 km) north of Royston), as a B-17 Flying Fortress pilot. Morgan went overseas as part of the original group of combat crews and flew 25 combat missions over Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, between November 7, 1942, and May 17, 1943.

===&quot;Memphis Belle&quot;===
The &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; was the second heavy bomber in the Eighth Air Force to complete 25 combat missions in the European Theatre; and was the first to return to the United States as part of a publicity campaign to sell war bonds. In those missions, all of which were daylight raids, the &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; flew 148 hours, dropped more than 60 tons of bombs and had every major part of the plane replaced at least once. Morgan and his crew were the subjects of a 1944 film documentary, &quot;Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress&quot;.

===Career===
Promoted to major, Morgan did a second combat tour commanding the 869th Bomb Squadron, 497th Bomb Group of the Twentieth Air Force in the Pacific Theater where he flew the B-29 Superfortress &quot;Dauntless Dotty&quot; from Isley Field, Saipan. The aircraft was nicknamed after his third wife, Dorothy Johnson Morgan. On November 24, 1944, he was pilot of the lead plane during the first mission of the XXI Bomber Command to bomb Japan. This mission was commanded by Brigadier General Emmett O&#x27;Donnell Jr.

Leaving active duty after World War II, he continued to fly in the Air Force Reserve, achieving command pilot status. Among his military awards were the Distinguished Flying Cross with two oak leaf clusters and the Air Medal with 10 oak leaf clusters. He retired from the Air Force Reserve with the rank of colonel in 1965. In the later 1960s, Morgan operated a car dealership in Martinsville, Virginia called Morgan Volkswagen. He later returned to his hometown of Asheville to retire.

In 2001 Morgan published his autobiography, &quot;The Man Who Flew the Memphis Belle: Memoir of a WWII Bomber Pilot&quot;, co-written with Ron Powers .

==Death==
Morgan was hospitalized April 22, 2004, with a fractured vertebra in his neck after falling outside the Asheville Regional Airport while returning home from what would be his last airshow appearance at the Sun &#x27;n&#x27; Fun airshow at Lakeland Linder International Airport in Lakeland, Florida. He died at Mission Hospital on May 15, 2004, from complications due to his injuries, including pneumonia. Morgan was buried at the Western Carolina Veterans Cemetery in Swannanoa, North Carolina.

<text>John MacEnery (27 November 1796 – 18 February 1841) was a Roman Catholic priest from Limerick, Ireland and early archaeologist who came to Devon as Chaplain to the Cary family at Torre Abbey in 1822. In 1825, 1826 and 1829, he investigated the prehistoric remains at Kent&#x27;s Cavern in Devon, having been shown the cave by Thomas Northmore.

MacEnery concluded that the palaeolithic flint tools he found in the same contexts as the bones of extinct prehistoric mammals meant that early humans and the creatures such as mammoths co-existed.

His contemporaries had great difficulty reconciling his findings to their pre-Darwinian view of the earth&#x27;s history. 20th century commentators suggest it was the influence of the theologian William Buckland who persuaded MacEnery to doubt the evidence he saw before him, which led to MacEnery never publishing his work. However, Edward Vivian stated that it was simply the expense which caused him to abandon publication. MacEnery left Torquay and his cave research in 1830 and it was left to Vivian, whose heavily edited version of his work was published in 1859, and then later to William Pengelly who publicised and explored the original manuscript of his findings in 1869, many years after MacEnery&#x27;s death at age 43.

John MacEnery studied for the priesthood in St Munchin&#x27;s College, the Limerick Diocesan College then in Palmerstown County Limerick, where he was ordained in 1819.

MacEnery retired early due to ill health following an accident and lived for a time in Rome and Paris before returning to Torre Abbey in 1838. He died on 18 February 1841, and is buried in Torre Churchyard, Torquay.

<doc id="658799" wikidata="Q1281252" url="?curid=658799" title="Tawaraya Sōtatsu">
<text>was a Japanese furniture designer and painter of the Rinpa school.

Sōtatsu is best known for his decorations of calligraphic works by his partner Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu (1558–1637), and his spectacular and highly influential &quot;byōbu&quot; folding screens, such as National Treasures &quot;Wind God and Thunder God&quot; and his painting of the &quot;Sekiya&quot; and &quot;Miotsukushi&quot; chapters from The Tale of Genji. He also popularized a technique called &quot;tarashikomi&quot;, in which a second layer of paint is applied before the first layer is dry.

He is also credited with co-founding the Rinpa school of Japanese painting, together with Kōetsu. &quot;Rinpa&quot; was not strictly a school, but a group of artist directly influenced by Sōtatsu and Kōetsu. Some of the most notable Rinpa artists are Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716), Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743) and Sakai Hōitsu (1761–1828). While not particularly known at the time he lived and painted, he is now the second-most recognized Japanese painter in terms of number of inclusions in the National Treasures of Japan list.

== Biography ==
The exact date of Sōtatsu&#x27;s birth, probably around 1570, remains unknown, and so does the place of his birth. The painter Tani Bunchō (1763–1841) stated that Sōtatsu was originally from Noto and that he studied under Sumiyoshi Jokei in Kyoto. His family name may have been Nonomura.

In 1602 he was hired by the Taira family to repair the 12th-century sutra scrolls &quot;Heike nōkyō&quot; at the Itsukushima shrine on Miyajima. This is the earliest paintings attributed to Sōtatsu, but it already features the characteristics of his later work. It is suspected that Kōetsu might have also worked in the repair of the scroll.

The first confirmed collaboration with Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu (1558–1637) is in the &quot;Sagabon&quot; (Saga Books), an ambitious project started around 1606 by Suminokura Soan (1571–1632) to publish elaborate editions of classical Japanese book and Noh librettos. Sōtatsu created the designs for the covers and paper of many of the books, while Kōetsu was the calligrapher of some of the texts. The name &quot;Sagabon&quot; comes from the suburb of Kyoto where the book were produced.

Sōtatsu married a cousin of Koetsu. He also opened a shop in Kyoto, named Tawaraya, where he sold a variety of decorated objects, including fans, lantern paper, screens, dolls and patterns for kimono, and also took commissions for decorating interiors. The shop soon gained recognition for its artistic excellence.

The collaboration between Sōtatsu and Kōetsu came to an end around 1620, perhaps because he was moving away from the profession of decorator and designer, and started focusing more on his career as a painter.

He decorated the doors and screens of the Yōgen-in temple during the reconstruction ordered by Tokugawa Hidetada&#x27;s wife in 1621, and in 1630 he was given the title of &quot;hokkyō&quot; (&quot;Bridge of the Dharma&quot;), the third highest rank awarded to Buddhist artists.

The circumstances of Sōtatsu&#x27;s death are not known, but he probably died around 1640. The most successful among his direct students were Tawaraya Sōsetsu and Kitawaga Sōsetsu.

== Works ==
&quot;Waves at Matsushima&quot;, painted in the 1620s, is considered by some to be Sōtatsu&#x27;s masterwork.

 is a handscroll decorated by Sōtatsu using silver and gold pigment, with calligraphy by Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu. It contains some of the finest calligraphy by Kōetsu and one of the best examples of Sōtatsu&#x27;s decorative skills. The work was most likely produced between 1602 and 1620, the period during which Sōtatsu and Kōetsu are generally considered to have worked together.

The text of the scroll is a compilation of waka poems from the poets known collectively as &quot;Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry&quot; (&quot;Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry&quot;), including one poem from each one of the 36 members of the group. The visual motif is that of cranes, which stand or fly in flocks across the entire length of the scroll. The skill of Sōtatsu&#x27;s design and its &quot;cutting-edge originality&quot; have been highly praised.

The scroll measures 34.1 cm x 1356 cm and belongs to the Kyoto National Museum. It is an Important Cultural Property.

Poem Scroll with Deer is another collaboration with Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu. Silver and gold deer frolic alongside poems from the anthology Shin Kokinshu (新古今集). It was split into fragments after World War II. The largest contiguous section, accounting for more than one-third of the complete work, is currently at the Seattle Art Museum.

 is a pair of two-folded screens made using ink and color on gold-foiled paper. It depicts Raijin, the god of lightning, thunder and storms in the Shinto religion and in Japanese mythology, and Fūjin, the god of wind. The screens have no inscription or seal, but its attribution to Tawaraya Sotatsu is not questioned.

It is a particularly prominent work in the Rinpa school because two other of its major figures, Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716) and Sakai Hōitsu (1761–1828), replicated the painting in homage (see Kōrin&#x27;s version). All three versions of the work were displayed together for the first time in seventy-five years in 2015, at the Kyoto National Museum exhibition &quot;Rinpa: The Aesthetics of the Capital&quot;.

Each screen measures 169.8 cm × 154.5 cm (66.9 in × 60.8 in). They belong to the Zen Buddhist temple Kennin-ji in Kyoto, but they are exhibited occasionally in the Kyoto National Museum. They are a National Treasure of Japan.

Dragons and Clouds is a work in the Freer Gallery of Art, also known as the National Museum of Asian Art, in Washington, D.C. and was not discussed by Japanese art historians until 1971, when Yumane Yuzo placed this painting in the context of artworks in Japan, such as the &quot;Waves and Dragon&quot; screen in the Honpou-ji Temple in Kyoto. Details about the ownership of this painting prior to its purchase by Charles Lang Freer in 1905 from the art dealer Bunshichi Kobayashi are unknown, but it&#x27;s now considered one of the finest example&#x27;s of Sotatsu&#x27;s use of the tarashikomi wet-on-wet technique, in which ink is artfully pooled to create features such as the clouds.

At the time Sotatsu created this screen, monochrome ink paintings of dragons were often based on 15th-century work by monk-painters such as Sesshu and Sesson, and also the earlier, Chinese painters Chen Rong (famed for his dragon paintings) and Muqi. By the 17th-century, dragons had emerged as a popular motif on large format works such as folding screens and sliding door panels. Sotatsu&#x27;s &quot;Dragon and Clouds&quot; is a six-panel screen, is dated to early 1600s although its place in the chronology of his work is disputed, and has dimensions of 171.5x 374.3 cm (top), 171.5 x 374.6 cm (bottom). The ascending, larger dragon on one side soars towards the heavens in spring, whereas the side&#x27;s dragon descends into the abyss in fall.

<text>Malice Green (April 29, 1957 – November 5, 1992) was an American resident of Detroit, Michigan who died after being assaulted by Detroit police officers Walter Budzyn and Larry Nevers on November 5, 1992. The official cause of death was ruled to be due to blunt force trauma to his head.

Budzyn and Nevers were patrolling in Detroit in plain clothes in an unmarked vehicle. Green had pulled up to a house known for drug activity. Budzyn asked Green for his driver&#x27;s license, and Green then walked around to the passenger side of the car and sat in the passenger seat with his legs out of the doorway. Green looked through the glove compartment and grabbed something from the car&#x27;s floor. Budzyn asked Green to let go of the object. Green allegedly failed to relinquish a vial of crack cocaine. After refusing to let go, Nevers struck Green in the head with his flashlight approximately 7 to 14 times during the struggle, which, according to the official autopsy, resulted in his death. After the struggle, Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment of the head injuries sustained in the struggle and died.

The seven officers present at the scene were suspended soon after Green&#x27;s death, and the city of Detroit paid a civil settlement to Green&#x27;s family. Budzyn and Nevers were convicted of second-degree murder in 1993, while charges against another officer were dropped and a fourth was found not guilty. However, both convictions were overturned. Following retrials, Budzyn was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 1998 and Nevers was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2000.

==Initial reaction==
The incident occurred only months after the Los Angeles riots of 1992, which protested the acquittal of police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney King (Green was also a Black man). Unlike in Los Angeles, Detroit Police Department&#x27;s Chief Stanley Knox suspended the seven officers present at the scene of the crime within 24 hours of Malice Green&#x27;s death. Charges for four of the officers soon followed.

In December 1992, the city of Detroit paid a civil agreement of $5.25 million to Malice Green&#x27;s family.

Sergeant Freddie Douglas, the only Black officer on the scene of Green&#x27;s death, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to intervene. Officer Robert Lessnau was charged with assault. Officers Larry Nevers and Walter Budzyn, partners, were charged with 2nd degree murder for Green&#x27;s death. Known by many in the neighborhood as Starsky and Hutch, they were both highly decorated, with a documented history of excessive force complaints. Larry Nevers was a former member of the Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets (STRESS) unit in Detroit, which was disbanded in 1974 after 20 Black men were shot by its police over a 3-year period. He was months away from retirement at the time of Green&#x27;s death.

Prior to jury selection, Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young stated that Green was &quot;literally murdered by police&quot; on national television.

==Legal proceeding==

===Charges===
Officers Nevers, Budzyn, Robert Lessnau, and Freddie Douglas were charged in the death. Ultimately, charges against Douglas were dropped, and Lessnau was acquitted of assault. 

===Coroner&#x27;s reports===
The report was done by Dr. Kahlil Jiraki, the most junior coroner in the department. It was alleged by the defense that his report was rushed due to workload and his impending vacation. 

The autopsy showed cuts to the scalp, as well as subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain contusions. However, there were no skull fractures, no other bone fractures. Green&#x27;s heart was enlarged and the arteries hardened. Toxicology results ultimately showed that Green had a cocaine level of 0.50 micrograms.

Jiraki concluded that the death was caused by blunt force trauma, which caused swelling of the brain. Jiraki testified in Budzyn and Nevers&#x27; trial that the damage was done by &quot;fourteen blunt force trauma blows to the head.&quot; He stated that his boss, Dr. Bader Cassin, agreed that Green&#x27;s drug consumption was as &quot;insignificant as the color of his eyes&quot; in relation to the cause of death.

Under cross-examination, Jiraki testified that there was no swelling noted in the report, nor any fractures to the skull. In the trial of Sgt. Douglas, Jiraki reduced the number of blows to seven (which fit with Nevers&#x27; testimony). At Nevers&#x27; second trial, Cassin testified that he examined the body the day after Jiraki made his examination (this second exam was never disclosed to the defense prior to, or during, the first trial) and that drugs played a major part in Green&#x27;s death.

After the second trial, Jiraki sued the coroner&#x27;s office, claiming he had been pressured by his superiors to change his findings to state that cocaine contributed to Green&#x27;s death (which he refused to do) which would have supported the police officer&#x27;s defense. He was awarded $2.5 million. The coroner&#x27;s officer later alleged during the civil trial that Jiraki was fired for supposed mental instability and absenteeism.

Jiraki&#x27;s testimony was supported by the prosecution&#x27;s medical expert, Dr. Michael Baden. After the trial, Baden allegedly told a pathologists&#x27; conference that he came to his conclusion based on information surrounding the circumstances of Green&#x27;s death and the facts in the exam.

Budzyn and Nevers&#x27; defense presented three experts, one of whom stipulated that they identified eleven blunt-force injuries to Green&#x27;s head. However, they testified that Green&#x27;s head injuries were entirely &quot;superficial&quot; and &quot;could not have caused his death.&quot; They noted that Green had no fractures, no significant bleeding or bruising of the brain, and no swelling of the brain. It was their opinion that Green died as a result of cocaine and alcohol abuse, combined with his physical struggle with police as he resisted arrest, and the minor head injuries. They stated that these things, in combination, caused a surge of adrenaline which overloaded the electrical circuits in Green&#x27;s brain resulting in brain seizure, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest and death.

===Trial===
Wayne County then-Assistant Prosecutors Kym Worthy and Douglas Baker tried the case against Budzyn and Nevers. Judge George Crockett III, in Detroit Recorder&#x27;s Court, presided. The officers were tried together in Detroit after being denied a change of venue. Budzyn and Nevers were allowed separate juries. Both juries were composed of a majority of black citizens (two whites on Nevers&#x27; jury, one on Budzyn&#x27;s), and both juries reached unanimous verdicts.

The testimony of the responding emergency medical technicians (EMTs) was very damaging to Budzyn and Nevers&#x27; case. All of them testified that Green was covered with blood and was hanging from the driver&#x27;s side door when they arrived. The EMTs further said that Nevers struck Green in the head with his heavy police flashlight repeatedly, even though Green was not offering any significant resistance. Two of them stated that Nevers told Green to open his hands and hold still, and that, when he did not, Nevers hit him with the flashlight. They described Green as &quot;dazed&quot; and &quot;stuporous&quot; during the incident, saying that Green was uttering only a few words like &quot;wait&quot; while Nevers was striking him. Lee Hardy, one of the responding EMTs, testified during the separate assault trial for Robert Lessnau that he witnessed the former officer kicking Green in the head while he lay prone on the street.

During the trial, movies were provided for the jurors&#x27; entertainment while they were sequestered, including the film &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. The film depicts scenes of police brutality being perpetrated by white police officers, including the recent beating of Rodney King. It also contains a voiceover that claims white police officers are the direct descendants of the Ku Klux Klan. Both juries were shown the film on at least two occasions during the trial.

===Verdict===
On August 23, 1993, the jury found Budzyn and Nevers guilty of second degree murder. Two months later, Nevers was sentenced to serve 12 to 25 years in prison and Budzyn was sentenced to serve 8 to 18 years in prison.

===Appeals===
On July 31, 1997, the Michigan Supreme Court granted a new trial for Budzyn, mostly on the grounds of showing the movie &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (the movie&#x27;s opening scenes show video of the Rodney King incident) to sequestered jury members while they waited to begin deliberating. It was learned that a political appointee of Mayor Young had made it onto the jury, and she was instrumental in showing the movie to jury members. Budzyn was immediately released from prison. He was retried, and on March 19, 1998, he was again found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. In January 1999, the Michigan Court of Appeals instated a four-year prison sentence. He had already served the minimum under the first conviction, and was released.

Nevers&#x27; 1997 appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court was denied. However, Nevers was successful on his appeal to a federal court, with United States District Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff overturning the verdict and ordering his release on December 30, 1997. Zatkoff cited the showing of &quot;Malcolm X&quot; and its footage of the Rodney King beating video as creating a &quot;harmful effect&quot; on their verdict decision and thus counted as justification for not only overturning his conviction, but also granting him a writ of habeas corpus. 

In 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed Zatkoff&#x27;s decision, with the United Supreme Court afterwards denying the prosecution&#x27;s bid for a writ of certiorari. The appeals court argued that at least one juror in the case was influenced by the perception that a not guilty verdict would lead to riots, threatening the jury&#x27;s impartiality. Nevers was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in May 2000 and sentenced to 7–15 years in prison. In March 2003, this conviction was overturned by the Michigan Court of Appeals, but, in September 2003, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed and upheld the conviction. On May 13, 2005, Nevers lost a bid to appeal the conviction in federal court. During this process, Nevers was treated for lung cancer and was released in 2001 to serve the rest of his sentence at home.

==Aftermath==
In 2007, Larry Nevers wrote a self-published book titled &quot;Good Cops, Bad Verdict.&quot; He died in February 2013.

== Popular culture ==
* Outsider musician Wesley Willis&#x27; song &quot;Larry Nevers/Walter Budzyn&quot; is about the trial and aftermath of the beating.
* Insane Clown Posse referred to Nevers as someone who is going to receive retribution for his crimes in their song &quot;Wagon Wagon&quot; from &quot;Ringmaster&quot;
* Underground Resistance dedicated their release &quot;Message To The Majors&quot; to Malice Green.
* Although not written about the death of Green, Pearl Jam included a picture of Green in the booklet for their 1993 album, &quot;Vs&quot;, beside lyrics to the song &quot;W.M.A.&quot; which alludes to racial profiling among US police.
* The single &quot;Fight Music&quot; by Detroit-based rap group D12 references the death of Green.
* Detroit rapper Bruiser Wolf references Green in a guest verse on the song &quot;Y.B.P. (ft. Bruiser Wolf)&quot; from Detroit-born rapper Danny Brown&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;Quaranta&quot;. In his verse, Wolf raps: &quot;Police violence, that&#x27;s how Malice Green died.&quot;

<doc id="658808" wikidata="Q7881229" url="?curid=658808" title="Material conditional">
<text>The material conditional (also known as material implication) is an operation commonly used in logic. When the conditional symbol formula_1 is interpreted as material implication, a formula formula_2 is true unless formula_3 is true and formula_4 is false. Material implication can also be characterized inferentially by &quot;modus ponens&quot;, &quot;modus tollens&quot;, conditional proof, and classical &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;.

Material implication is used in all the basic systems of classical logic as well as some nonclassical logics. It is assumed as a model of correct conditional reasoning within mathematics and serves as the basis for commands in many programming languages. However, many logics replace material implication with other operators such as the strict conditional and the variably strict conditional. Due to the paradoxes of material implication and related problems, material implication is not generally considered a viable analysis of conditional sentences in natural language.

== Notation ==
In logic and related fields, the material conditional is customarily notated with an infix operator formula_5. The material conditional is also notated using the infixes formula_6 and formula_7. In the prefixed Polish notation, conditionals are notated as formula_8. In a conditional formula formula_9, the subformula formula_10 is referred to as the &quot;antecedent&quot; and formula_11 is termed the &quot;consequent&quot; of the conditional. Conditional statements may be nested such that the antecedent or the consequent may themselves be conditional statements, as in the formula formula_12.

=== History ===
In &quot;Arithmetices Principia: Nova Methodo Exposita&quot; (1889), Peano expressed the proposition &quot;If formula_13, then formula_14&quot; as formula_13 Ɔ formula_14 with the symbol Ɔ, which is the opposite of C. He also expressed the proposition formula_17 as formula_13 Ɔ formula_14. Hilbert expressed the proposition &quot;If &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot; as formula_20 in 1918. Russell followed Peano in his &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1910–1913), in which he expressed the proposition &quot;If &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot; as formula_17. Following Russell, Gentzen expressed the proposition &quot;If &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot; as formula_17. Heyting expressed the proposition &quot;If &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot; as formula_17 at first but later came to express it as formula_20 with a right-pointing arrow. Bourbaki expressed the proposition &quot;If &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;&quot; as formula_25 in 1954.

==Definitions==

===Semantics===
From a classical semantic perspective, material implication is the binary truth functional operator which returns &quot;true&quot; unless its first argument is true and its second argument is false. This semantics can be shown graphically in a truth table such as the one below. One can also consider the equivalence formula_26.

===Truth table===
The truth table of formula_27:

The logical cases where the antecedent is false and is true, are called &quot;vacuous truths&quot;.
Examples are ...
* ... with false: &quot;If Marie Curie is a sister of Galileo Galilei, then Galileo Galilei is a brother of Marie Curie&quot;,
* ... with true: &quot;If Marie Curie is a sister of Galileo Galilei, then Marie Curie has a sibling.&quot;.

===Deductive definition===
Material implication can also be characterized deductively in terms of the following rules of inference.

* &quot;Modus ponens&quot;
* Conditional proof
* Classical contraposition
* Classical &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;

Unlike the semantic definition, this approach to logical connectives permits the examination of structurally identical propositional forms in various logical systems, where somewhat different properties may be demonstrated. For example, in intuitionistic logic, which rejects proofs by contraposition as valid rules of inference, formula_28 is not a propositional theorem, but the material conditional is used to define negation.

==Formal properties==

When disjunction, conjunction and negation are classical, material implication validates the following equivalences:
* Contraposition: formula_29
* Import-export: formula_30
* Negated conditionals: formula_31
* Or-and-if: formula_32
* Commutativity of antecedents: formula_33
* Left distributivity: formula_34

Similarly, on classical interpretations of the other connectives, material implication validates the following entailments:
* Antecedent strengthening: formula_35
* Vacuous conditional: formula_36 
* Transitivity: formula_37
* Simplification of disjunctive antecedents: formula_38

Tautologies involving material implication include:
* Reflexivity: formula_39
* Totality: formula_40
* Conditional excluded middle: formula_41

== Discrepancies with natural language ==

Material implication does not closely match the usage of conditional sentences in natural language. For example, even though material conditionals with false antecedents are vacuously true, the natural language statement &quot;If 8 is odd, then 3 is prime&quot; is typically judged false. Similarly, any material conditional with a true consequent is itself true, but speakers typically reject sentences such as &quot;If I have a penny in my pocket, then Paris is in France&quot;. These classic problems have been called the paradoxes of material implication. In addition to the paradoxes, a variety of other arguments have been given against a material implication analysis. For instance, counterfactual conditionals would all be vacuously true on such an account, when in fact some are false.

In the mid-20th century, a number of researchers including H. P. Grice and Frank Jackson proposed that pragmatic principles could explain the discrepancies between natural language conditionals and the material conditional. On their accounts, conditionals denote material implication but end up conveying additional information when they interact with conversational norms such as Grice&#x27;s maxims. Recent work in formal semantics and philosophy of language has generally eschewed material implication as an analysis for natural-language conditionals. In particular, such work has often rejected the assumption that natural-language conditionals are truth functional in the sense that the truth value of &quot;If &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;Q&quot;&quot; is determined solely by the truth values of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. Thus semantic analyses of conditionals typically propose alternative interpretations built on foundations such as modal logic, relevance logic, probability theory, and causal models.

Similar discrepancies have been observed by psychologists studying conditional reasoning, for instance, by the notorious Wason selection task study, where less than 10% of participants reasoned according to the material conditional. Some researchers have interpreted this result as a failure of the participants to conform to normative laws of reasoning, while others interpret the participants as reasoning normatively according to nonclassical laws.

<text>Earl de Grey, of Wrest in the County of Bedford, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The title was created on 25 October 1816 (as Countess de Grey) for Amabell Hume-Campbell, Dowager Lady Polwarth and &quot;suo jure&quot; 5th Baroness Lucas, with remainder to the heirs male of her body, and in default of such issue to her sister Mary Jemima Robinson, Dowager Baroness Grantham, and the heirs male of her body. She was the elder daughter and co-heir of Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, and Jemima Campbell, 2nd Marchioness Grey (see Marquess Grey), eldest daughter of John Campbell, 3rd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland, and Lady Amabel Grey, eldest daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent (see Duke of Kent).

The marquessate of Grey had become extinct on her mother&#x27;s death in 1797, and when the Grey title was revived in favour of her daughter, the style &quot;de Grey&quot; was used to distinguish it from the earldom of Grey, which had been created in 1806; the Grey family was extremely distantly related to the Earls Grey. The Countess de Grey was the widow of Alexander Hume-Campbell, Lord Polwarth, eldest son of Hugh Hume, 3rd Earl of Marchmont.

The Countess de Grey was childless, and she was succeeded in the barony of Lucas according to the normal descent of that title and in the earldom of de Grey according to the special remainder by her nephew, Thomas Robinson, 3rd Baron Grantham, who assumed the surname of de Grey on succeeding to the title. Lord de Grey was the eldest son of Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, and the aforementioned Mary Jemima Robinson, Dowager Baroness Grantham (died 1830), sister of the Countess de Grey (see Marquess of Ripon for earlier history of the Robinson family).

He died in 1859 and was succeeded in the barony of Lucas (which could be passed on through female lines) by his eldest daughter Lady Anne (see Baron Lucas for further history of this title) and in the earldom of de Grey (which could only be passed on through male lines) by his nephew, George Robinson, 2nd Earl of Ripon, only son of F. J. Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon, the former prime minister better known as Lord Goderich. On succeeding to the earldom of de Grey, Lord Ripon styled himself &quot;Earl de Grey and Ripon&quot;. In 1871, he was created Marquess of Ripon, whereafter Earl de Grey became the courtesy title used by the heir apparent to the marquessate. Ripon was succeeded by his son and only surviving child, Frederick Robinson, 2nd Marquess of Ripon. The second Marquess was childless, and on his death in 1923, the marquessate and earldom of de Grey and all other titles became extinct.

<text>Marquess Grey is a title that was created in the Peerage of Great Britain on 19 May 1740 for Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, with remainder to the male issue of his body and in default thereof to his granddaughter, the Honourable Jemima Campbell, and the heirs male of her body. The Duke of Kent died only two weeks after the creation of the marquessate, at which point the dukedom and most of its subsidiary titles became extinct (see Duke of Kent).

He was succeeded in the barony of Lucas (which could be passed on through female lines) and in the marquessate of Grey according to the special remainder by his granddaughter Jemima, who became the second Marchioness Grey. She was the daughter of John Campbell, Lord Glenorchy, later 3rd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland, and Lady Amabel Grey (died 1726), eldest daughter of the Duke of Kent. On 22 May 1740, three days after the marquessate was created, she married the Honourable Philip Yorke, later 2nd Earl of Hardwicke. They had two daughters, Lady Amabel Yorke and Lady Mary Yorke.

Lady Grey died in January 1797, aged 73. As she had no sons, the marquessate died with her. However, she was succeeded in the barony of Lucas by her elder daughter, Lady Amabel, who in 1816 was created Countess de Grey in her own right (see Earl de Grey for further history of this title).

<doc id="658825" wikidata="Q384023" url="?curid=658825" title="Cinderella (band)">
<text>Cinderella was an American rock band formed in the suburbs of Philadelphia in 1983. The band emerged in the mid-1980s with a series of multi-platinum studio albums and hit singles whose music videos received heavy MTV rotation and popularity. Cinderella initially had a glam metal sound throughout the late 1980s before shifting into a more blues rock-based sound during the early to mid 1990s.

By the mid-1990s, the band&#x27;s fame declined precipitously due to personal setbacks, breakups, and changes in the American music industry. After a brief hiatus, Cinderella reunited in 1996 and continued to perform live, but never released any studio material after their 1994 album &quot;Still Climbing&quot;. The band has sold 15 million records worldwide, according to band member Tom Keifer&#x27;s official website. After participating in the 2014 Monsters of Rock Cruise, Cinderella again became inactive. In November 2017, Keifer stated that the band has no plans to reform in the future.

==History==
===Early days (1983–1985)===
Cinderella was formed in 1983 in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb, by singer-songwriter, keyboardist, and guitarist Tom Keifer and bassist Eric Brittingham. The initial lineup also included guitarist Michael Schermick and drummer Tony Destra.

In 1985, Shermick and Destra left to form Britny Fox, another Philadelphia-based glam metal band. Cinderella practiced in the attic of the American Legion building in Wayne, Pennsylvania. In a 2014 interview, Tom Keifer stated that Kiss bass guitarist Gene Simmons first took interest in the band and tried to get them a deal with PolyGram, but they were not interested. Jon Bon Jovi saw them perform at the Empire Rock Club in Philadelphia and talked to his A&amp;R man, Derek Shulman about seeing the group. Shulman was not convinced at first either, and wanted to sign the band to a six-month development deal. After extensive negotiations, he finally signed the band. In 1985, with a recording contract with Mercury/Polygram Records in the works, guitarist Jeff LaBar and drummer Jim Drnec joined the band.

===&quot;Night Songs&quot; and &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; (1986–1989)===
During the recording of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Night Songs&quot;, studio session drummer Jody Cortez and lead guitarist/songwriter Barry Benedetta were brought in to help with the recording. After the recording was completed, Drnec was replaced by Gloucester City, New Jersey, drummer Albie &quot;Al&quot; Barker, who just missed making the album&#x27;s cover and the band&#x27;s album lineup. Fred Coury joined the band and was in all MTV music videos and played in the upcoming tours. &quot;Night Songs&quot; was released on August 2, 1986, and eventually achieved triple platinum status, selling 50,000 copies per week at one point. The heavy metal album reached No. 3 on the Billboard charts in February 1987. By the end of 1987, the band released a video compilation called &quot;Night Songs&quot; to accompany the album, featuring the promotional videos from the album plus three live songs recorded on their 1986 tour.

Cinderella&#x27;s first tour was in 1986 with glam metal rockers Poison, opening for Japanese heavy metal band Loudness. Further tours into 1987 were spent playing to large arena audiences: five months opening for former Van Halen lead singer David Lee Roth, and seven months with Bon Jovi, taking the opening slot for their Slippery When Wet Tour. Later that year, the band went overseas, appearing in Japan, Scandinavia, and at the Monsters of Rock festivals in United Kingdom and Germany.

Cinderella&#x27;s second album, &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot;, was released in 1988. The new album signified a shift towards a blues rock sound, though it could still be described as glam metal. A 254-show tour to support the album lasted over 14 months, and in August 1989, the band performed at the Moscow Music Peace Festival alongside other metal acts, such as Ozzy Osbourne, the Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and Skid Row. The tour&#x27;s stage show included Tom Keifer being lowered to the stage while playing a white piano during their radio hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Know What You Got (Till It&#x27;s Gone)&quot;. On April 17, 1990, the band released a video compilation called &quot;Tales from the Gypsy Road&quot; featuring four promo videos from &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; plus two live medleys, the second of which contained a cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s famous &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;.

===&quot;Heartbreak Station&quot;, &quot;Still Climbing&quot; and hiatus (1990–1995)===
Cinderella&#x27;s third album, &quot;Heartbreak Station&quot;, was released in 1990. It featured more songs influenced by Keifer&#x27;s love of the blues. Following the accompanying tour, Fred Coury left the band and joined former Ratt vocalist Stephen Pearcy in the band Arcade. The song &quot;Hot and Bothered&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; and its subsequent soundtrack.

In 1991, Keifer lost his voice due to a paresis of his vocal cords. He underwent several surgeries to repair a vocal cyst and hemorrhage. This added to delays in the recording of the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Still Climbing&quot;. It was finally released in 1994 with Kenny Aronoff on drums, but the album quickly disappeared from the charts. Mercury Records consequently dropped the band which went on hiatus in 1995.

===Reunion (1996–2009)===

Cinderella resumed activity in 1996, and a year later, Mercury Records released a greatest hits compilation titled &quot;Once Upon A...&quot; and a video compilation containing all the bands promo videos from the first three albums. The group toured the United States in 1998, with one concert stop captured on the live album &quot;Live at the Key Club&quot;, which was released in 1999 through Cleopatra Records.

Around 1999, the band was signed by John Kalodner to Sony Records. However, the band was dropped by the label before a new album could be released, plunging the band into three years of litigation. Cinderella toured again in 2000 and 2002.

Cinderella headlined the VH1 Classic Rock Never Stops Tour in the summer of 2005. Also in 2005, Cinderella toured with FireHouse, RATT, and Quiet Riot. Mercury Records released the compilation &quot;Rocked, Wired &amp; Bluesed: The Greatest Hits&quot; on CD and DVD.

In 2006, Cinderella toured with Poison. Both bands celebrated the 20th anniversary of their debut albums, &quot;Night Songs&quot; and &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot;. Cinderella planned to tour in 2008 with Warrant, Lynch Mob, and Lynam, but on June 13 that year, Tim Heyne, the band&#x27;s manager, said in a press release: &quot;It is with unbelievably deep regret that I must announce that Cinderella&#x27;s Tom Keifer&#x27;s left vocal cord has hemorrhaged, thereby making it impossible for him to sing in the immediate future.&quot; LaBar was interviewed by &quot;Ultimate-Guitar&quot; and stated that Cinderella would love to make a new record but there were obstacles holding the group back. They still were not signed to a record label after Sony dropped the band in 2000. LaBar also stated that he is busy with his new band, Freakshow, which features Frankie Banali of Quiet Riot, and Eric is busy with Naked Beggars. A message posted to the Cinderella message board in spring 2009 stated that Keifer&#x27;s voice had returned to normal. Promoters from the 2009 Rock Gone Wild Festival confirmed that the band was scheduled to perform, but the festival was canceled.

===More touring and final performances (2010–2014)===

Cinderella confirmed on their message board that they would be touring in 2010 with two warm-up dates already confirmed. It was announced on February 22 that Cinderella would be a part of Rocklahoma 2010 in Pryor Oklahoma and Sweden Rock Festival 2010.

On February 26, 2010, it was announced that Cinderella would be the headliner of the MSC Poesia sailing from Fort Lauderdale on November 11, 2010. In July 2010, Cinderella took the stage to open for Bret Michaels, during the &quot;Common Ground Music Festival&quot; in Lansing, Michigan, with an original lineup of stars including Tom Keifer, Eric Brittingham, Jeff LaBar and Fred Coury. They would follow that with 14 dates in the US supporting Scorpions on their &quot;Get Your Sting and Blackout&quot; farewell tour.

Cinderella played at the Download festival in the United Kingdom in June 2010, the Rock Jam near Grand Junction, Colorado, Friday, August 27, and also the Oregon State Fair on September 4, 2010. In November 2010, Cinderella joined a variety of other hard rock acts on the cruise entitled &quot;ShipRocked&quot;.

In 2011, Cinderella undertook a 25th anniversary world tour. 20 shows were confirmed from April through July. During the tour, they headlined the first edition of the &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; Festival in Germany.

In the summer 2012, Cinderella performed a headlining tour throughout the United States with opening act Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach.

In March 2013, Cinderella was scheduled to play the 2013 Monsters of Rock Cruise along with bands such as Tesla, Kix, Queensrÿche, and others, but had to cancel due to Tom Keifer being ill. In 2014, the band played their final performances on the 2014 Monsters of Rock cruise.

===Aftermath and LaBar&#x27;s death (2017–2021)===
In November 2017, Keifer stated that Cinderella had no plans to reunite, explaining that &quot;issues between the band members are beyond repair.&quot;

On July 14, 2021, it was announced that Jeff LaBar had died at the age of 58. The next day, former long-term touring keyboardist Gary Corbett also died.

<text>Westley Allan Dodd (July 3, 1961 – January 5, 1993) was an American convicted serial killer and sex offender who sexually assaulted and murdered three young boys in Vancouver, Washington, in 1989. He was arrested later that year after a failed attempt to abduct a six-year-old boy at a movie theatre in Camas Washington.

Dodd wrote detailed accounts of his murders in a diary that was found by police. After pleading guilty to charges of murder, he received the death penalty. After refusing an automatic appeal, he was executed by hanging on January 5, 1993, the first legal hanging in the United States since 1965.

== Early life ==
Westley Allan Dodd was born in Toppenish, Washington, on July 3, 1961, the oldest of three children to James and Carol Dodd. Dodd claimed he was never abused or neglected as a child, though he did state that the words &quot;I love you&quot; were never said to him as he grew up and that he could not remember saying them in return. Dodd&#x27;s younger brother Gregory was arrested in 2016 for the attempted sexual abuse of a 13-year-old girl.

&quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reported that Dodd described in a diary written during his imprisonment that his father had been emotionally and physically abusive, that he was often neglected in favor of his younger siblings and that he witnessed violent fights between his parents. At school, Dodd was not welcomed into any social groups, leaving him with no friends. By the age of 9 he had discovered that he was sexually attracted to other boys. On July 3, 1976—Dodd&#x27;s fifteenth birthday—his father attempted suicide following an argument with his wife. Dodd graduated from Richland High School in 1979.

== Criminal history ==
===Sex offenses===
At the age of 13, Dodd began exposing himself to children in his neighborhood. His father eventually told an Oregon newspaper that he was aware of this behavior but largely ignored it, since he felt his son was otherwise a &quot;well-behaved child who never had problems with drugs, drinking or smoking.&quot; By the time he entered high school, Dodd had progressed to child molestation, beginning with his younger cousins and then with neighborhood children he offered to babysit, as well as the children of a woman his father was dating. At the age of 15, Dodd was arrested for indecent exposure, but police released him with a recommendation for juvenile counseling.

In August 1981, at the age of 20, Dodd tried to abduct two girls, who reported him to the police. No action was taken. The following month, Dodd enlisted in the United States Navy and was assigned to the submarine base in Bangor, Washington, where he began abusing children who lived on the base. In one of these incidents, Dodd offered a group of boys $50 to accompany him to a motel room for a game of strip poker. Upon his arrest, Dodd confessed to police that he planned to molest the boys. He was released with no charges filed. Dodd was arrested again shortly afterwards for exposing himself to a boy and was dishonorably discharged from the Navy. He spent nineteen days in jail and underwent court-ordered counselling. In May 1984, he was arrested for molesting a 10-year-old boy but received only a suspended sentence.

Dodd planned his entire life around easy access to &quot;targets&quot;, as he referred to children. He moved into an apartment block that housed families with children, and worked at fast food restaurants, as a charity truck driver and other such jobs. Dodd repeatedly molested the pre-school-aged children of a neighbor, but the woman declined to press charges, fearing the experience would be too traumatic for her children.

In 1987, Dodd tried to lure a young boy into a vacant building, but the boy refused to go with him and instead told police. Prosecutors were aware of Dodd&#x27;s history of sexual offenses and recommended five years in prison. However, once again, Dodd received minimal punishment because he had not actually touched the boy nor exposed himself. Instead, he was placed on probation and ordered to seek psychiatric treatment. After finishing probation, Dodd stopped going to treatment and moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he was hired as a shipping clerk.

In the early autumn of 1989, Dodd decided that David Douglas Park in Vancouver, a large, heavily wooded park with several secluded trails, would be an ideal place to find potential victims. He was arrested several times over the next few years for child molestation, each time serving short jail sentences and being given court-mandated therapy. All Dodd&#x27;s victims (around fifty in all) were below the age of 12, some of them aged as young as 2, and most were boys.

Dodd&#x27;s sexual fantasies became increasingly violent as his behavior escalated; he would later say, &quot;The more I thought about it, the more exciting the idea of murder sounded. I planned many ways to kill a boy.&quot; A psychiatrist who evaluated Dodd following one of his convictions said that he fit the legal criteria for a &quot;sexual psychopath.&quot;

===Murders===
On September 4, 1989, Dodd went to David Douglas Park with a fish fillet knife and shoelaces, seeking out young boys to kill. He lured two brothers, 11- and 10-year-old Cole and William Neer, to a secluded area, where he forced them to undress, tied them to a tree and performed sex acts on both. When he was done, Dodd stabbed the boys repeatedly with the knife and fled the scene. The boys were soon discovered in the park. Cole was found dead at the scene, while William died en route to a nearby hospital. Afterward, Dodd started a scrapbook with newspaper clippings about the murders. 

On October 29, Dodd drove to Portland, Oregon, where he encountered 4-year-old Lee Iseli and his 9-year-old brother Justin at a local park. The younger boy was playing alone on a slide, and Dodd succeeded in convincing the boy to come with him. Justin had gone home, so Dodd told Lee that he would drive him back to his house. He managed to take Lee to his apartment in Vancouver apparently unnoticed, and there he ordered the boy to undress. Dodd then tied Lee to his bed and molested him, taking photographs of the abuse. Dodd kept Lee overnight while he continued to abuse him, all the while jotting down every detail in his diary. The next morning, Dodd strangled Lee to death with a rope and hung his body in the closet, photographing it as a macabre &quot;trophy&quot;.

Dodd would later confess to police that he had originally planned not to kill the boy, but eventually decided that it was necessary to eliminate him based on his possible testimony. He stuffed Lee&#x27;s nude body in trash bags, which he threw in some bushes near Vancouver Lake. He also burned Lee&#x27;s clothing in a trash barrel except for the boy&#x27;s underwear, which he kept as a souvenir of the crime. One day later, Lee&#x27;s body was discovered, sparking a manhunt for the killer. Dodd kept a low profile and mostly stayed in his apartment, writing down future plans for child abductions and constructing a homemade torture rack for his next victim.

==Arrest==
On November 13, 1989, Dodd drove to Camas, Washington, around east of Vancouver, where he attempted to abduct 6-year-old James Kirk II from the restroom of the New Liberty Theatre. Kirk began fighting and crying as Dodd attempted to leave the theatre through the lobby, carrying the boy in his arms. Theatre employees became suspicious and followed Dodd out to the street. Due to their pursuit, Dodd released Kirk, got into his car and drove away.

Kirk&#x27;s mother&#x27;s boyfriend, William &quot;Ray&quot; Graves, came to the theatre lobby and was told that the boy had nearly been abducted. Graves went outside the theatre in the direction where Dodd was last seen. Dodd&#x27;s car had broken down a short distance away and he was attempting to start the motor. In order not to raise Dodd&#x27;s suspicion and to stall for time, Graves pretended to be a passerby and offered to help him. He then put Dodd into a headlock and returned him to the theatre, where employees called the police.

The Camas police contacted the Portland police task force investigating the Iseli murder. Dodd was taken to Camas police station, where Portland detectives C.W. Jensen and Dave Trimble interviewed him. He was then taken to the Clark County jail in Vancouver, where Jensen and Trimble continued their interrogation over the course of three days. Eventually, Dodd confessed to all three murders. Jensen and Trimble then served a search warrant at Dodd&#x27;s residence in Vancouver.

During the search of Dodd&#x27;s residence, police discovered the homemade torture rack along with newspaper clippings about his crimes, a briefcase containing Iseli&#x27;s underwear, a photo album containing pictures of Iseli and assorted photographs of children in newspaper and store catalogue underwear advertisements. They also discovered Dodd&#x27;s diary, in which he wrote in detail about the murders. Dodd was charged with aggravated first-degree murder in the deaths of the Neer brothers and Iseli, plus attempted kidnapping of another child. He initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, but later changed his plea to guilty.

==Trial==
During his trial in Clark County Superior Court, the prosecution read excerpts of Dodd&#x27;s diary and displayed photographs of Iseli in captivity. The defense did not call any witnesses or present any evidence, suggesting only that Dodd was legally insane. The jury found Dodd guilty; prosecutors requested the death penalty and the jury agreed. Dodd would claim that speaking in his own defense was pointless and, ultimately, &quot;the system had failed repeatedly&quot;. Washington State law gave Dodd the choice of execution by lethal injection or by hanging; Dodd stated that he wished to die by hanging because that was how he had killed Iseli, his last victim.

In 1990, Dodd was sentenced to death for the murder of the Neer brothers, as well as for the separate rape and murder of Lee Iseli.

==Execution==
Less than four years elapsed between the murders and Dodd&#x27;s execution. He refused to appeal his case or the capital sentence, insisting that he could not control his urges and would kill again. He stated in one court brief: &quot;I must be executed before I have an opportunity to escape or kill someone else. If I do escape, I promise you I will kill and rape again, and I will enjoy every minute of it.&quot; He also said in some interviews that death would give him relief from guilt over the murders. During his trial, Dodd wrote a pamphlet on how parents could protect children from child molesters such as himself.

Dodd&#x27;s execution by hanging was the first in the United States since George York and James Latham were hanged by Kansas in 1965. The execution was witnessed by twelve members of local and regional media, prison officials and family members of the three victims. Dodd ordered broiled salmon and fried potatoes for his last meal. His last words, spoken from the second floor of the indoor gallows, were recorded by the media witnesses as:
Dodd was executed at 12:05 a.m. on January 5, 1993, at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. He was pronounced dead by the prison doctor and his body was transported to Seattle for autopsy. King County Medical Examiner Donald Reay found that Dodd had died quickly, within two to three minutes, though not from a broken neck, which is rarely the usual cause of death from hanging. Reay stated that Dodd&#x27;s death had likely not been very painful. Dodd was cremated following the autopsy, and his ashes turned over to his family.

=== Execution controversy ===
Dodd&#x27;s execution came with some controversy over his choice of execution method. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit saying that execution by hanging was a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The lawsuit made it all the way to the Washington Supreme Court, but was unsuccessful in blocking Dodd&#x27;s execution, largely because Dodd himself chose hanging.

On the day of the execution, many people gathered outside the prison, either supporting or protesting the execution. There was much media attention; some television news reports featured stories on the history of hanging, showing such things as the loud sound that the trap door can make, along with the silence that follows it; the type of rope that was going to be used; and how to properly prepare the rope for optimum effect.

==In popular culture==
Dodd&#x27;s profile was featured along with another convicted sexual predator imprisoned in Washington in the 1992 &quot;Frontline&quot; episode &quot;Monsters Among Us&quot;.

Dodd&#x27;s crimes are included in the Investigation Discovery series &quot;Real Detective&quot;. In the episode titled &quot;Malice&quot;, detective C. W. Jensen describes his involvement in bringing Dodd to justice and the effect it had on him personally.

In 2006 Discovery Channel television show &quot;Most Evil&quot; analyzed his life and crimes. He was ranked at level 22, the highest point of the scale.

Dodd was the basis for an unseen character, a child killer named &quot;Wayne Dobbs&quot;, in the 2002 film &quot;Insomnia&quot;, starring Al Pacino. He was fictionalized as a man who murdered a young boy in a way similar to Dodd&#x27;s murder of Lee Iseli.

Several books have been written about the case, including: &quot;When the Monster Comes Out of the Closet&quot; by Lori Steinhorst, who communicated with Dodd in writing and by phone almost daily for 18 months prior to his execution; &quot;Driven to Kill&quot; by true crime author Gary C. King; and Dr. Ron Turco&#x27;s book about his experience during the initial investigation to assist in developing a profile of the killer.

<text>Form-versus-content humour is a type of humour in an incongruity between a statement&#x27;s content and the way it is communicated makes it humorous. It is one of the basic techniques of tragicomic humour. Form-versus-content humour can be delivered, for example, by presenting a message in a form that inherently defeats the ostensible purpose of the message, or in a form that is fundamentally incapable of carrying the important part of the message. The &quot;Jargon File&quot; gives an example of this type of humor: a red index card with GREEN written on it.

<text>Ein Herz und eine Seele (literally &quot;One Heart and One Soul&quot; i.e. &quot;hand in glove&quot;) is a German television sitcom based on the British sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; by Johnny Speight. The show premiered on 15 January 1973 and lasted for 25 episodes (22 original stories and 3 remakes), airing its last on 22 November 1976, the last four episodes featuring a revamped cast. &quot;Ein Herz und eine Seele&quot; was written by Wolfgang Menge.

The show was extremely successful during its initial run and it still proves very popular in reruns, in which only the colour episodes are traditionally aired. Two episodes in particular, &quot;Sylvesterpunsch&quot; (about the family&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party) and &quot;Rosenmontagszug&quot; (set during the winter carnival season) have gained such popularity that they are now shown traditionally on German TV on New Year&#x27;s Eve and &quot;Rosenmontag&quot;, respectively.

==Storyline==
The show reflects the life of a petty bourgeois family in West German Wattenscheid, characterised by the social climate of the Willy Brandt era and its political upheavals initiated by the German student movement of 1968. &quot;Ein Herz und eine Seele&quot; makes intensive use of references to German politics and social issues of the early and mid-1970s, when Germany was still divided, not just between East and West, but also (in the case of West Germany) between liberals and conservatives. To feature these tensions in a TV series broke new ground at that time.

The undisputed star is &quot;Ekel&quot; (&quot;creep&quot;) Alfred Tetzlaff (Heinz Schubert), commercial clerk, a born Sudeten German, &quot;Bild&quot; reader and reactionary patriarch, who is constantly arguing with his wife Else, his daughter Rita, and his son-in-law Michael. He is a declared foe of the SPD government ruining the country only to sell it to the Mongols, of foreigners, &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot;, Jews and the women&#x27;s movement. During his term of service in the Wehrmacht he had spent time in Paris, which finds expression in his (dubious) language skills. Alfred&#x27;s appearance, small in physique (Schubert was ) with a moustache and side-parted hair, along with his passionate politicking with a high-pitched voice and frequent hand movements, make his character somewhat of a parody of Adolf Hitler—a portrayal that was (and is) limited by West German law. Raised in Berlin he is a dedicated fan of Hertha BSC, which makes life somewhat hard in the Ruhr area.

Alfred is married (afflicted) with Else, a housewife from Elmshorn, whose fatuity constantly drives him mad. She ceaselessly speaks up, confusing Pompidou with Pompadour and Kiesinger with Kissinger, honestly astonished that the Germans had elected a Jewish chancellor. (In this sense, although the German Else was named after the British version of the character, the quiet but sometimes snarky Else Garnett, the character more closely resembled Edith Bunker from the American version of the show, &quot;All in the Family&quot;.) Ironically, Alfred&#x27;s use of &quot;dusselige Kuh&quot;, literally &quot;silly cow&quot;, as a nickname for Else was not allowed in the BBC original: the British character Alf Garnett had to refer to his wife as a &quot;silly moo&quot;.

The young couple, Rita and her husband Michael, cannot afford an apartment and live in Rita&#x27;s child&#x27;s room. Michael is a supporter of Chancellor Willy Brandt and moreover was raised in East Germany, which arouses Alfred&#x27;s suspicion of him being a Komsomol, a Bolshevik hyena and an anarchist. Michael&#x27;s parents still live in East Germany; as retirees they are allowed to visit their son and his new family in the episode &quot;Besuch aus der Ostzone&quot; (&quot;Visit from the Eastern Zone&quot;), an episode which exists both in black-and-white and colour and is usually aired on German Unity Day.

==Broadcast==
The show was originally broadcast in black and white and shown on the regional channel of the North Rhine-Westphalia area, WDR. It moved to West Germany&#x27;s first channel, ARD, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1973 with the above-mentioned episode and from that date was produced in colour. Three of the colour ARD episodes are actually remakes or reprises of black-and-white episodes that had previously aired on WDR. Episodes were regularly recorded live-to-tape the day of broadcast, which allowed the show to handle events with an immediacy rare for sitcoms of the era.

For the second series, Elisabeth Wiedemann, popular in her role as Else Tetzlaff, was replaced by Helga Feddersen and Michael, formerly played by Diether Krebs, was portrayed by Klaus Dahlen. Whereas the original actors portrayed stereotypical but believable characters, Feddersen and Dahlen turned their roles into purely comedic characters, introducing slapstick. Only four episodes were produced of Season 2, with the final episode, &quot;Closing Words,&quot; serving as the series finale.

Despite its polarization and abusive language, the series was initially very popular with up to 15.7 million viewers. It declined in the ratings due to the cast changes in the second series. In 2002, a survey showed the program was Germany&#x27;s most popular sitcom of all time.

In 2004 the complete series was released to DVD and was a best seller.

<text>Mines Paris – PSL, officially École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris (; until May 2022 Mines ParisTech), and also known as École des mines de Paris, ENSMP, Mines de Paris, les Mines, or Paris School of Mines, is a French grande école and a constituent college of PSL Research University. It was originally established in 1783 by King Louis XVI.

Mines Paris is distinguished for the outstanding performance of its research centers and the quality of its international partnerships with other prestigious universities in the world, which include Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (Harvard SEAS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, University of Hong Kong, National University of Singapore (NUS), Novosibirsk State University, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and Tokyo Tech.

Mines Paris also publishes a world university ranking based on the number of alumni holding the post of CEO in one of the 500 largest companies in the world: the &quot;Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities.&quot; The school is a member of the ParisTech (Paris Institute of Technology) alliance.

==History==

A school of mining had been proposed by Henri Bertin in 1765 but it was the chemist Balthazar-Georges Sage who, though not a chemist of repute, was a royalist who was able to influence Jacques Necker (1732–1804) of the value of mineralogy in training students in mining. This was achieved through the use of his own large collections of minerals, and a chair in mineralogy was established on July 11, 1778. The school of mines was begun at the mint, the Hôtel de la Monnaie, Paris. The school was officially opened by decree of the French King&#x27;s Counsel on March 19, 1783.

The school disappeared at the beginning of the French Revolution but was re-established by decree of the Committee of Public Safety in 1794, the 13th Messidor Year II. It moved to Savoie, after a decree of the consuls the 23rd Pluviôse Year X (1802).

After the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, the school moved to the &quot;Hôtel de Vendôme&quot; (in the 6th arrondissement in Paris&#x27; Jardin du Luxembourg). From the 1960s onwards, it created research laboratories in Fontainebleau, Évry, and Sophia Antipolis (Nice).

==Education==
&quot;École des mines de Paris&quot; is a member of the &quot;Groupe des écoles des mines&quot; (GEM), a group of 8 Institut Mines-Telecom (IMT) engineering schools that are &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

The initial aim of the École des mines de Paris, namely to train high-level mining engineers, evolved with time to adapt to the technological and structural transformations undergone by society. Mines Paris - PSL has now become one of the most prestigious French engineering schools with a broad variety of subjects. Its students are trained to have management positions, work in research and development departments, or as operations officers, etc. They receive a well-rounded education in a variety of subjects, ranging from the most technical (Mathematics, Physics) to economics, social sciences or even art in order to be able to tackle the managing or engineering-related issues they are to face. Exchange programs are possible during the third semester with prestigious universities around the world, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (Caltech), University of Hong Kong, National University of Singapore (NUS), Tokyo Tech, Seoul National University...

Although the IMT engineering schools are more expensive than public universities in France, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Many of the top ranked schools in Europe are members of the &quot;(CGE)&quot;, as are the IMT engineering schools. Degrees from the IMT are accredited by the and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) ().

Mines Paris - PSL provides different educational paths:

*The &quot;Ingénieurs civils&quot; degree (Master of Science and Executive Engineering), ranked among the best French grandes écoles engineering degrees, similar to that offered at , École des Ponts ParisTech and CentraleSupélec.
*The Corps of Mines, one of the greatest technical corps of the French state. It is a third cycle degree, lasting for three years, consisting in two long-term internships both in public and private economical institutions and courses in economics and public institutions. The admission to the Corps des Mines is highly selective as only the top students from , École normale supérieure, Mines ParisTech and Telecom Paris may apply.
*&quot;Mastère Spécialisé&quot; degree, (post-graduate specialization degree) post-graduate programs accredited by the , in the fields of Energy, Environment, Transport and Logistics, Informatics, Safety and management in industry and Materials engineering.
*Doctoral (19 schools) and Master (9 programs) studies in various fields.

For students having studied in the Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles (a two-year highly selective undergraduate program in Mathematics, Physics and Engineering, among others), admission to Civil Engineer of Mines is decided through a nationwide competitive examination. Every year, ten applications are also accepted from students around the world according to their academic achievements.

Admission to the Corps of Mines is possible for French students at the end of the studies in École polytechnique, École normale supérieure, École des télécommunications de Paris and École des mines de Paris (these two later, after a specific examination), or from the other great technical corps of the French state. Admission in third year is also open to one Ph.D graduate.

<text>William Pengelly, FRS FGS (12 January 1812 – 16 March 1894) was a British geologist and amateur archaeologist who was one of the first to contribute proof that the Biblical chronology of the earth calculated by Archbishop James Ussher was incorrect.

==Biography==
Born at East Looe in Cornwall, the son of a sea captain, he left school at the age of 12 to join his father&#x27;s crew. Returning to Looe while still in his teens, he spent his time reading widely and learning mathematics. In about 1836 he moved to Torquay and opened a day school teaching according to the fashionable Pestalozzian method. In 1846 he gave up his successful school to become a private tutor and also started lecturing on various scientific subjects – a career he continued for the rest of his life.

Pengelly published his first scientific paper in 1849, on fossil fish found in East Cornwall. This was the first of some 120 papers on geology, palaeontology and human prehistory he would publish. In 1862 Pengelly reviewed the geology of the Tertiary lignite deposits of Bovey Tracey in an important paper read to the Royal Society, and the following year was elected a fellow of the society.

Pengelly&#x27;s desire to educate led him to found the Torquay Young Men&#x27;s Society (later the Torquay Mechanics&#x27; Institute), the Torquay Natural History Society, and (in 1862) the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Literature, Science, and Art (now The Devonshire Association). He also contributed papers to the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall&quot;.

Pengelly married his cousin, Mary Ann Mudge, in 1838. They had three children, before she died in 1851. Two years later he married Lydia Spriggs, a member of a Quaker family, and had two daughters. The younger, Hester, became his biographer. Hester became a writer and, in 1902, married Henry Forbes Julian, a mining engineer, founder of the Royal Automobile Club and co-writer of &quot;Cyaniding Gold and Silver Ores&quot;. Julian went down with the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Contributions to science==
Pengelly&#x27;s most significant contribution to science was his work on caves in Devon and their human occupation. He excavated at Kents Cavern in Devon following earlier work done by Father John MacEnery, and found similar evidence (Palaeolithic flint tools and the bones of extinct animals in the same strata) as MacEnery. Pengelly had the advantage of working in a time of more open geological and religious thinking, which enabled him to find support and funding for the publication of his and MacEnery&#x27;s work, but sceptics were nevertheless able to oppose his findings, on the grounds that possible later intrusion into earlier layers could not be ruled out in such a frequently excavated cave.

In 1858, however, a newly discovered cave – Windmill Hill Cavern – offered a definitive chance to test Pengelly&#x27;s theories. Under the auspices (and supervision) of the Royal Society and the Geological Society, he and the archaeologist John Evans were able to conduct a scientific investigation into British prehistory. By exposing an unbroken stalagmite sheet covering the cave floor, and then demonstrating &quot;beneath&quot; it the co-existence of cave lion and woolly rhinoceros bones with human-crafted flints, Pengelly was able to triumphantly prove the case for the ancient presence of Stone Age man. Pengelly thereafter returned to Kents Cavern in 1864, to spend another fifteen years on careful excavation work to establish man&#x27;s co-existence with a wholly extinct fauna. His work, along with that of pioneers such as Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes, produced reasoned argument against the traditional Biblical chronology.

Pengelly, on various occasions exchanged letters with Charles Darwin amongst others describing results gathered. These letters are a matter of record. Pengelly&#x27;s discoveries led him to conclude (amongst others like John Evans) that the traditional Biblical chronology did not appear to match their research, a case made forcefully by them in 1859.

With reference to his election to the Royal Society in 1863, the list of signatories is significant:
* Charles Babbage – Inventor of the Computer 
* John Lee – President of the Royal Astronomical Society 1861–63
* Sir Charles Lyell – the father of British Geology
* Hugh Falconer – Scottish Geologist and proponent of Punctuated Equilibrium
* Sir Roderick Murchison – Scottish Geologist described the Silurian System
* Sir Andrew Ramsay – Scottish Geologist, Director-General Geological Survey
* Rev. John Barlow – Secretary of the Royal Institution of Great Britain 1843–1860
* Leonard Horner – Scottish Geologist, President Geological Society 1846 &amp; 1860
* Joseph Beete Jukes – English Geologist – early survey of Newfoundland (1839–40), first complete map of geology of Australia (1850)
* John Percy – Physician
* Charles Manby – Civil Engineer, Bishop of Exeter and president of the Devonshire Association 1872–3
Also James Yates, Henry Bristow (Geology), Charles Daubeny (Chemist), B Stewart (Physicist), Prof. David Ansted (King&#x27;s College London)

<doc id="658867" wikidata="Q8043763" url="?curid=658867" title="Xenu's Link Sleuth">
<text>Xenu, or Xenu&#x27;s Link Sleuth, is a computer program that checks websites for broken hyperlinks. It is written by Tilman Hausherr and is proprietary software available at no charge. The program is named after Xenu, the galactic ruler from Scientology scripture.

==Format==
Link Sleuth runs on Microsoft Windows. Link verification is performed on links which appear in codice_1 tags, as well as images, frames, plug-ins, backgrounds, local image maps, style sheets, scripts, and Java applets. The program follows links to other pages, and checks the links on those pages also, so it is possible to check an entire site for broken links in one session. Xenu displays a continuously updated list of URLs which can be sorted according to different criteria. The program uses a &quot;simple, no-frills user-interface&quot;, and can help users understand how certain Web sites are structured. The program has support for SSL Web sites.

==Reception==
Xenu&#x27;s Link Sleuth software was called the &quot;fastest link-checking software&quot; by &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, and &quot;amazingly fast and very accurate&quot; by a University of Wyoming newsletter. The software was used as a testing tool in a usability study at Grand Valley State University.

Xenu&#x27;s Link Sleuth has also been cited by Rossett&#x27;s &quot;The ASTD E-Learning Handbook&quot;, Zhong&#x27;s &quot;Intelligent Technologies for Information Analysis&quot;, Gerrard&#x27;s &quot;Risk-Based E-Business Testing&quot;, Reynolds&#x27; &quot;The Complete E-Commerce Book&quot;, Slocombe&#x27;s &quot;Max Hits: Websites that Work&quot;, George&#x27;s &quot;The ABC of SEO&quot;, as well as the German books &#x27;, and &#x27;, and Italian books, &#x27;, and &#x27;.

<text>Cults ( ) is a suburb on the western edge of Aberdeen, Scotland. It lies on the banks of the River Dee and marks the eastern boundary of Royal Deeside.

Cults, known for its historic granite housing, sits approximately six miles from the coast of the North Sea. Cults maintains village status and many of the societal structures found in a country village, despite its proximity to the west of Aberdeen. The name is a corruption of &quot;Coilltean&quot;, the Scottish Gaelic word for &quot;Woods&quot;. There are various green spaces in Cults, the largest of these being Allan Park, a public park situated near the golf club and the River Dee. The park is also home to the Cults Cricket Club.

==History==
Originally, Cults had two railway stations on the Royal Deeside Railway Line, West Cults and Cults before the line was closed in the middle of the 20th century. The route has since been converted into a cycle path and walkway which leads to Duthie Park in Aberdeen in one direction and further into Deeside in the other, running alongside Cults&#x27; public park, Allan Park. Cults was also on a tram route between Aberdeen and Bieldside, operated by the Aberdeen Suburban Tramways Company until 1927. Today, public transport to Aberdeen takes the form of buses.

==Notable people==
*Rev Thomas Jackson Crawford DD FRSE was minister of Cults, living in the manse
*Majel Davidson, artist
*Stuart Holden, retired United States national team player, TV analyst, and co-owner of RCD Mallorca
*Anna (Nan) Shepherd, writer, literary critic, and teacher
*Archibald Smith, recipient of the Victoria Cross

==Amenities== 
Cults is served by a variety of small shops, churches, modest-sized hotels and eateries, mostly situated in the village centre. Key amongst them are the Kelly of Cults supermarket, which closed in 2015; the golf-themed Cults Hotel; the Deeside Golf Club (shared with Bieldside.) Similarly, the local shop situated on Kirk Brae (commonly known as &#x27;Archie&#x27;s&#x27;) has been a mainstay of Cults since the 1970s. Cults is also home to the Cults Parish Church, which was formed by the merger of the Cults East and Cults West parishes, with the buildings of the former now housing an outreach centre. There are several local shops operating, including a family run toy shop (Will&#x27;s toy shop / Alexander R Will), a gift, furniture and interior shop (Sonya Angus) and a number of hairdressers. Cults was also once home to the Stakis-owned Royal Darroch Hotel which exploded on an October morning in 1983 due to gas build up, killing six staff and guests. A few chain stores have branches in Cults, along with C.K.D Galbraith and the Bank of Scotland.

==Education==
There are three main schools in the village: the state-run Cults Primary School and Cults Academy (one of Scotland&#x27;s top-performing secondary schools). The village is also only a short drive from the International School of Aberdeen (ISA) in Pitfodels and 
a complex of Rudolf Steiner Camphill schools in Bieldside.

<doc id="658871" wikidata="Q943162" url="?curid=658871" title="Turboshaft">
<text>A turboshaft engine is a form of gas turbine that is optimized to produce shaft horsepower rather than jet thrust. In concept, turboshaft engines are very similar to turbojets, with additional turbine expansion to extract heat energy from the exhaust and convert it into output shaft power. They are even more similar to turboprops, with only minor differences, and a single engine is often sold in both forms.

Turboshaft engines are commonly used in applications that require a sustained high power output, high reliability, small size, and light weight. These include helicopters, auxiliary power units, boats and ships, tanks, hovercraft, and stationary equipment.

==Overview==
A turboshaft engine may be made up of two major parts assemblies: the &#x27;gas generator&#x27; and the &#x27;power section&#x27;. The gas generator consists of the compressor, combustion chambers with ignitors and fuel nozzles, and one or more stages of turbine. The power section consists of additional stages of turbines, a gear reduction system, and the shaft output. The gas generator creates the hot expanding gases to drive the power section. Depending on the design, the engine accessories may be driven either by the gas generator or by the power section.

In most designs, the gas generator and power section are mechanically separate so they can each rotate at different speeds appropriate for the conditions, referred to as a &#x27;free power turbine&#x27;. A free power turbine can be an extremely useful design feature for vehicles, as it allows the design to forgo the weight and cost of complex multiple-ratio transmissions and clutches.

An unusual example of the turboshaft principle is the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135-PW-600 turbofan engine for the STOVL Lockheed F-35B Lightning II – in conventional mode it operates as a turbofan, but when powering the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem, it switches partially to turboshaft mode to send 29,000 horsepower forward through a shaft and partially to turbofan mode to continue to send thrust to the main engine&#x27;s fan and rear nozzle.

Large helicopters use two or three turboshaft engines. The Mil Mi-26 uses two Lotarev D-136 at 11,400 hp each, while the Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion uses three General Electric T64 at 4,380 hp each.

==History==
The first gas turbine engine considered for an armoured fighting vehicle, the GT 101 which was based on the BMW 003 turbojet, was tested in a Panther tank in mid-1944.
The first turboshaft engine for rotorcraft was built by the French engine firm Turbomeca, led by its founder Joseph Szydlowski. In 1948, they built the first French-designed turbine engine, the 100-shp 782. Originally conceived as an auxiliary power unit, it was soon adapted to aircraft propulsion, and found a niche as a powerplant for turboshaft-driven helicopters in the 1950s. In 1950, Turbomeca used its work from the 782 to develop the larger 280-shp Artouste, which was widely used on the Aérospatiale Alouette II and other helicopters. This was following the experimental installation of a Boeing T50 turboshaft in an example of the Kaman K-225 synchropter on December 11, 1951, as the world&#x27;s first-ever turboshaft-powered helicopter of any type to fly. 

The T-80 tank, which entered service with the Soviet Army in 1976, was the first tank to use a gas turbine as its main engine. Since 1980 the US Army has operated the M1 Abrams tank, which also has a gas turbine engine. (Most tanks use reciprocating piston diesel engines.) The Swedish Stridsvagn 103 was the first tank to utilize a gas turbine as a secondary, high-horsepower &quot;sprint&quot; engine to augment its primary piston engine&#x27;s performance. The turboshaft engines used in all these tanks have considerably fewer parts than the piston engines they replace or supplement, mechanically are very reliable, produce reduced exterior noise, and run on virtually any fuel: petrol (gasoline), diesel fuel, and aviation fuels. However, turboshaft engines have significantly higher fuel consumption than the diesel engines that are used in the majority of modern main battle tanks.

<doc id="658906" wikidata="Q27636" url="?curid=658906" title="Majority rule">
<text>In social choice theory, the majority rule (MR) is a social choice rule which says that, when comparing two options (such as bills or candidates), the option preferred by more than half of the voters (a &quot;majority&quot;) should win.

In political philosophy, the &quot;majority rule&quot; is one of two major competing notions of democracy. The most common alternative is given by the utilitarian rule (or other welfarist rules), which identify the spirit of liberal democracy with the equal consideration of interests. Although the two rules can disagree in theory, political philosophers beginning with James Mill have argued the two can be reconciled in practice, with majority rule being a valid approximation to the utilitarian rule whenever voters share similarly-strong preferences. This position has found strong support in many social choice models, where the socially-optimal winner and the majority-preferred winner often overlap.

Majority rule is the most common social choice rule worldwide, being heavily used in deliberative assemblies for dichotomous decisions, e.g. whether or not to pass a bill. Mandatory referendums where the question is yes or no are also generally decided by majority rule. It is one of the basic rules of parliamentary procedure, as described in handbooks like &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order.&quot;

== Alternatives ==

=== Plurality rules ===
A common alternative to the majority rule is the plurality-rule family of voting rules, which includes ranked choice voting (RCV), two-round plurality, and first-preference plurality. These rules are often used in elections with more than two candidates. Such rules elect the candidate with the most votes after applying some voting procedure, even if a majority of voters would prefer some other alternative.

=== Cardinal rules ===
The utilitarian rule, and cardinal social choice rules in general, take into account not just the number of voters who support each choice but also the intensity of their preferences.

Philosophers critical of majority rule have often argued that majority rule does not take into account the intensity of preference for different voters, and as a result &quot;two voters who are casually interested in doing something&quot; can defeat one voter who has &quot;dire opposition&quot; to the proposal of the two, leading to poor deliberative practice or even to &quot;an aggressive culture and conflict&quot;; however, the median voter theorem guarantees that majority-rule will tend to elect &quot;compromise&quot; or &quot;consensus&quot; candidates in many situations, unlike plurality-rules (see center squeeze).

=== Supermajority rules ===
Parliamentary rules may prescribe the use of a supermajoritarian rule under certain circumstances, such as the 60% filibuster rule to close debate in the US Senate. However such requirement means that 41 percent of the members or more could prevent debate from being closed, an example where the majority will would be blocked by a minority.

== Properties ==
=== May&#x27;s theorem ===
Kenneth May proved that the simple majority rule is the only &quot;fair&quot; ordinal decision rule, in that majority rule does not let some votes count more than others or privilege an alternative by requiring fewer votes to pass. Formally, majority rule is the only decision rule that has the following properties:

* Anonymity: the decision rule treats each voter identically (one vote, one value). Who casts a vote makes no difference; the voter&#x27;s identity need not be disclosed.
* Neutrality: the decision rule treats each &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;candidate&quot; equally (a free and fair election).
* Decisiveness: if the vote is tied, adding a single voter (who expresses an opinion) will break the tie.
* Positive response: If a voter changes a preference, MR never switches the outcome against that voter. If the outcome the voter now prefers would have won, it still does so.
* Ordinality: the decision rule relies only on &quot;which&quot; of two outcomes a voter prefers, not &quot;how much&quot;.
** This can be replaced by strategyproofness, i.e. every person&#x27;s dominant strategy is to honestly disclose their preferences.

=== Agenda manipulation ===

If voter&#x27;s preferences are defined over a multidimensional option space, then choosing options using pairwise majority rule is unstable. In most cases, there will be no Condorcet winner and any option can be chosen through a sequence of votes, regardless of the original option. This means that adding more options and changing the order of votes (&quot;agenda manipulation&quot;) can be used to arbitrarily pick the winner.

=== Other properties ===
In group decision-making voting paradoxes can form. It is possible that alternatives a, b, and c exist such that a majority prefers a to b, another majority prefers b to c, and yet another majority prefers c to a. Because majority rule requires an alternative to have majority support to pass, majority rule is vulnerable to rejecting the majority&#x27;s decision.

== Limitations ==

=== Arguments for limitations ===

==== Minority rights ====

A super-majority rule actually empowers the minority, making it stronger (at least through its veto) than the majority. McGann argued that when only one of multiple minorities is protected by the super-majority rule (same as seen in simple plurality elections systems), so the protection is for the status quo, rather than for the faction that supports it.

Another possible way to prevent tyranny is to elevate certain rights as inalienable. Thereafter, any decision that targets such a right might be majoritarian, but it would not be legitimate, because it would violate the requirement for equal rights. 
==== Instability ====

Some social choice theorists have argued cycling leads to debilitating instability. Buchanan and Tullock note that unanimity is the only decision rule that guarantees economic efficiency and eliminates the possibility of cycling in all cases.

=== Arguments against limitations ===

==== Minority rights ====

McGann argued that majority rule helps to protect minority rights, at least in deliberative settings. The argument is that cycling ensures that parties that lose to a majority have an interest to remain part of the group&#x27;s process, because any decision can easily be overturned by another majority. Furthermore, suppose a minority wishes to overturn a decision. In that case, under majority rule it just needs to form a coalition that has more than half of the officials involved and that will give it power. Under supermajority rules, a minority needs its own supermajority to overturn a decision.

To support the view that majority rule protects minority rights better than supermajority rules, McGann pointed to the cloture rule in the US Senate, which was used to prevent the extension of civil liberties to racial minorities. Saunders, while agreeing that majority rule may offer better protection than supermajority rules, argued that majority rule may nonetheless be of little help to the least minorities.

Under some circumstances, the legal rights of one person cannot be guaranteed without unjustly imposing on someone else. McGann wrote, &quot;one man&#x27;s right to property in the antebellum South was another man&#x27;s slavery.&quot; 

Amartya Sen has noted the existence of the liberal paradox, which shows that permitting assigning a very small number of rights to individuals may make everyone worse off.

==== Other arguments ====
Saunders argued that deliberative democracy flourishes under majority rule and that under majority rule, participants always have to convince more than half the group, while under supermajoritarian rules participants might only need to persuade a minority (to prevent a change). 

Where large changes in seats held by a party may arise from only relatively slight change in votes cast (such as under FPTP), and a simple majority is all that is required to wield power (most legislatures in democratic countries), governments may repeatedly fall into and out of power. This may cause polarization and policy lurch, or it may encourage compromise, depending on other aspects of political culture. McGann argued that such cycling encourages participants to compromise, rather than pass resolutions that have the bare minimum required to &quot;win&quot; because of the likelihood that they would soon be reversed.

Within this atmosphere of compromise, a minority faction may accept proposals that it dislikes in order to build a coalition for a proposal that it deems of greater moment. In that way, majority rule differentiates weak and strong preferences. McGann argued that such situations encourage minorities to participate, because majority rule does not typically create permanent losers, encouraging systemic stability. He pointed to governments that use largely unchecked majority rule, such as is seen under proportional representation in the Netherlands, Austria, and Sweden, as empirical evidence of majority rule&#x27;s stability.

<doc id="658907" wikidata="Q246931" url="?curid=658907" title="A. M. Rosenthal">
<text>Abraham Michael &quot;Abe&quot; Rosenthal (May 2, 1922 – May 10, 2006) was an American journalist who served as &quot;The New York Times&quot; executive editor from 1977 to 1986. Previously he was the newspaper&#x27;s metropolitan editor and managing editor. Following his tenure as executive editor, he became a columnist (1987–1999). Later, he had a column for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; (1999–2004).

He joined the newspaper in 1943 and remained at the Times for 56 years, to 1999. Rosenthal won a Pulitzer Prize in 1960 for international reporting. As an editor at the newspaper, Rosenthal oversaw the coverage of numerous major news stories including the escalation of the United States military&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War (1961–1975), the &quot;New York Times&quot; scoop of the Pentagon Papers (1971), and events that were part of the Watergate scandal (1972–1974). Rosenthal was instrumental in the paper&#x27;s coverage of the 1964 Kitty Genovese murder case, which established the concept of the &quot;bystander effect&quot;, but later came to be regarded as flawed and not credible.

Together with Catherine A. Fitzpatrick, he was the first Westerner to visit a Soviet Gulag camp in 1988. His son, Andrew Rosenthal, was &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial page editor from 2007 to 2016. His eldest son, Jonathan Rosenthal, is a retired physician who specialized in infectious diseases. His middle son, Daniel, is a retired financial executive who now owns a horse farm.

==Early years==
Rosenthal was born on May 2, 1922, in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, to a Jewish family. His father, Harry Shipiatsky, was a farmer who immigrated to Canada from Poland in the 1890s and changed his name to Rosenthal. He also worked as a fur trapper and trader around Hudson Bay, where he met and married Sarah Dickstein.

The youngest of six children, he was still a child when his family moved to the Bronx, New York, where Rosenthal&#x27;s father found work as a house painter. During the 1930s, though, tragedy hit the family when Rosenthal&#x27;s father died in a job accident and four of his siblings died from various causes.

According to his son, Andrew, he was a member of the Communist Party youth league briefly as a teenager in the late 1930s.

Rosenthal developed the bone-marrow disease osteomyelitis, causing him extreme pain and forcing him to drop out of DeWitt Clinton High School. After several operations at the Mayo Clinic, Rosenthal recovered enough to finish public schools in New York City and attend the City College of New York. At City College, Rosenthal wrote for the student newspaper, &quot;The Campus&quot;, and in 1943, while still a student, became the campus correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In February 1944, he became a staff reporter there.

Rosenthal was a foreign correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; for much of the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1954, he was assigned to New Delhi and reported from across South Asia. His writings from there were honored by the Overseas Press Club and Columbia University. In 1958, &quot;The New York Times&quot; transferred him to Warsaw, where he reported on Poland and Eastern Europe. In 1959, Rosenthal was expelled from Poland after writing that the Polish leader, Władysław Gomułka, was &quot;moody and irascible&quot; and had been &quot;let down—by intellectuals and economists he never had any sympathy for anyway, by workers he accuses of squeezing overtime out of a normal day&#x27;s work, by suspicious peasants who turn their backs on the government&#x27;s plans, orders and pleas.&quot;

Rosenthal&#x27;s expulsion order stated that the reporter had &quot;written very deeply and in detail about the internal situation, party and leadership matters. The Polish government cannot tolerate such probing reporting.&quot; For his reporting from Eastern Europe, Rosenthal won a Pulitzer Prize in 1960 for international reporting.

==Kitty Genovese murder case==

As metropolitan editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Rosenthal was instrumental in pushing an inaccurate account of the murder of Kitty Genovese on March 13, 1964. Rosenthal heard about the case over lunch with New York City Police Commissioner Michael J. Murphy. He assigned the story to reporter Martin Gansberg, who wrote an article published March 27, 1964, titled &quot;37 Who Saw Murder Didn&#x27;t Call the Police.&quot; (The article actually claimed there were 38 witnesses, but an error reduced the number by one in the headline.) The story was a sensation, prompting inquiries into what became known as the bystander effect or &quot;Genovese syndrome.&quot; Rosenthal wrote a book on the subject, and the incident became a common case study in American and British introductory psychology textbooks.

Immediately after the story broke, WNBC police reporter Danny Meehan discovered many inconsistencies in the article. Meehan asked &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Martin Gansberg why his article failed to reveal that witnesses did not feel that a murder was happening. Gansberg replied, &quot;It would have ruined the story.&quot; Not wishing to jeopardize his career by attacking powerful &quot;The New York Times&quot; editor Abe Rosenthal, Meehan kept his findings secret and passed his notes to fellow WNBC reporter Gabe Pressman. Later, Pressman taught a journalism course in which some of his students called Rosenthal and confronted him with the evidence. Rosenthal was irate that his editorial decisions were being questioned by journalism students and angrily berated Pressman in a phone call.

Decades later, researchers confirmed the serious flaws in &quot;The New York Times&quot; article. Only a dozen people saw or heard the attack, and none of them saw the entire incident. The newspaper admitted in 2016 that the witnesses did not know that a murder was taking place, assuming that two lovers or drunks were quarreling. Two people called the police, and one person went outside to Genovese and held her in her arms as she died.

==Editor==
In 1969, Rosenthal became managing editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; with overall command of the paper&#x27;s news operations. During the 1970s, he directed coverage of a number of important news stories, including the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.

Rosenthal played a decisive role in the paper&#x27;s decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Because this secret government history of the Vietnam War was classified information, publication of the papers could have led to charges of treason, lawsuits, or even jail time for paper staff. Rosenthal pushed for publishing the papers (along with &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Neil Sheehan and publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger). The Nixon administration sued to stop publication, resulting in a US Supreme Court decision, upholding the right of the press to publish items without &quot;prior restraint&quot; on the part of the government.

Columnist Wesley Pruden said about Rosenthal&#x27;s editorial policy:

==Political views==
Rosenthal supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and openly suggested that the United States should give Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and Sudan an ultimatum and order the countries to deliver documents and information related to weapons of mass destruction and terrorist organizations. Otherwise, &quot;in the three days the terrorists were considering the American ultimatum, the residents of the countries would be urged 24 hours a day by the U.S. to flee the capital and major cities, because they would be bombed to the ground beginning the fourth day.&quot;

Rosenthal was criticized as being homophobic and curtailing coverage of issues about and relating to gay people, including the early years of the AIDS epidemic.

==Later career==
Rosenthal had a weekly column at the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; following his run as a columnist at the &quot;Times&quot; until 2004.

==Death==

Rosenthal died in Manhattan on May 10, 2006, eight days after his 84th birthday. He is interred in Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. His epitaph inscribed on his grave marker (&quot;He kept the paper straight&quot;) was chosen to memorialize his efforts at &quot;The New York Times&quot; to deliver unbiased news.

<text>Holderness was a local government district and borough in northern England, named after the Holderness peninsula.

It was formed on 1 April 1974 along with the non-metropolitan county of Humberside in which it was situated. It was formed from part of the administrative county of Yorkshire, East Riding, namely:

*The municipal borough of Hedon, 
*The urban districts of Hornsea and Withernsea, 
*The Holderness Rural District.
The council&#x27;s headquarters were at Skirlaugh, in the converted workhouse that had been built in 1838.

On 1 April 1996, Humberside and the borough were abolished, and it became part of the new unitary East Riding of Yorkshire.

<text>Rachel Hunter (c. 1754 – 1813) was an English woman novelist of the early 19th century who lived and worked in Norwich. She was a contemporary of Jane Austen.

==Literary setting==
Rachel Hunter wrote for the same circulating library readership as Jane Austen, and like the latter she might belittle standard novel conventions in writings like &quot;Letitia&quot;. Her writings were well known in the Austen circle, one acquaintance describing a state of well-being as &quot;quite Palmerstone&quot;, after Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Letters from Mrs Palmerstone&quot;.

Jane&#x27;s niece Anna Austen had her aunt in stitches by reading passages from &quot;Lady Maclean&quot;, where the protagonists were always in floods of tears; and Jane herself composed a mock fan-letter to &quot;Mrs Hunter of Norwich...Miss Jane Austen&#x27;s tears have flowed over each sweet sketch in such a way as would do Mrs Hunter&#x27;s heart good to see&quot;.

==Works==
*&quot;Letitia, or, The Castle without a Spectre&quot; (1801)
*&quot;The History of the Grubthorpe Family&quot; (1802)
*&quot;Letters from Mrs Palmerstone to her Daughter, Inculcating Morality by Entertaining Narratives&quot; (1803)
*&quot;The Unexpected Legacy&quot; (1804)
*&quot;Lady Maclairn, the Victim of Villany&quot; (1806)
*&quot;Family Annals&quot; (1807)
*&quot;The Schoolmistress&quot; (1811)

<text>The East Yorkshire Borough of Beverley was a local government district and borough of Humberside, England, from 1974 to 1996.

It was formed on 1 April 1974, by the merger of the previous borough of Beverley, with Beverley Rural District and Haltemprice Urban District. Initially named &quot;Beverley&quot;, the name was formally changed by the council to &quot;East Yorkshire Borough of Beverley&quot; in 1981.

On 1 April 1996, Humberside was abolished along with the borough, and the area become part of a unitary East Riding of Yorkshire.

<doc id="658947" wikidata="Q1232174" url="?curid=658947" title="Datuk">
<text>Datuk (or its variant Dato or Datu) is a Malay title commonly used in Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia, as well as a traditional title by Minangkabau people in West Sumatra, Indonesia.

The title of the wife of a male Datuk is Datin. Women with the title can take either the title Datin or Datuk.

The title is similar or equivalent to Duke, Lord, Prince, Duc or Herzog in Europe.

== Origin ==
The oldest historical records mentioning about the title &quot;datuk&quot; is the 7th century Srivijayan inscriptions such as Telaga Batu from Palembang, Indonesia, to describe lesser kings or vassalized kings. It was called &quot;dātu&quot; in Old Malay language to describe regional leader or elder, a kind of chieftain that rules of a collection of &quot;kampungs&quot; (villages) called Kedatuan. The Srivijaya empire was described as a network or mandala that consisted of settlements, villages, and ports each ruled by a datu that vowed their loyalty (&quot;persumpahan&quot;) to the central administration of Srivijayan Maharaja. Unlike the indianized title of raja and maharaja, the term datuk was also found in the Philippines as datu, which suggests its common native Austronesian origin. The term &quot;kadatwan&quot; or &quot;kedaton&quot; refer to the residence of datuk, equivalent with keraton and istana. In later Mataram Javanese culture, the term kedaton shifted to refer the inner private compound of the keraton, the residential complex of king and royal family.

== Usage ==
=== Title of honours ===

In Brunei and Malaysia, Datuk or Dato is related to each country&#x27;s orders (). In general, it is a title or the prefix of a title given to a person upon being conferred with certain orders of honour. The power to bestow the order, thus the title, lies with the country&#x27;s sovereign (Sultan in Brunei, and Yang Di-Pertuan Agong in Malaysia for federal orders) as well as the ceremonial leaders of the states of Malaysia for state orders.

The usage of the variant spelling &quot;Datuk&quot; and &quot;Dato&quot; is differentiated in the following manner: &quot;Datuk&quot; is conferred by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Yang di-Pertua Negeri, the non-hereditary Malaysian state leader which is nominated by the state legislature. Meanwhile, &quot;Dato&quot; is conferred by a Sultan, the royal head of Brunei and some Malaysian states, as well as Yamtuan Besar which is the royal head of the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan.

A woman conferred with the order in her own right may be given with the title in which the word &quot;Datuk&quot; or &quot;Dato&quot; is replaced with &quot;Datin&quot;. Nevertheless, a woman may still be given the masculine form of the title.

The wife of a man conferred with Datuk or Dato is given the title &quot;Datin&quot;. However, the husband of a woman who has been given such a title is not given any Datuk-related title.

Permission will not be given for a UK citizen to use any title associated with a foreign or Commonwealth award in the UK. Meaning that anyone with the title Datuk or Dato can not be referred to as &quot;Sir&quot; and can only be referred to by their given title.

In 1808 a principal advisor of Sultan Tajuddin of Songkhla in present-day Thailand had an advisor/chancellor by name of Datuk Maharaja. This shows the early use of the title.

=== Minangkabau tradition ===

In Indonesia, datuk refers to honorific title of traditional community, especially among Malay and Minangkabau people. It is functioned as a title reserved for community leader that deals with traditions and community affairs. 

In Minangkabau tradition, Datuk (or &quot;Datuak&quot;) is a traditional, honorary title bestowed on a person by the agreement of a people or tribe in the Minangkabau language, spoken by the Minangkabau people. The title of &quot;Datuk&quot; was agreed upon by local, traditional leaders (&quot;Kerapatan Adat Nagari&quot;). The title engenders great respect, and is only used for Minangkabau men who have become stakeholders of traditional leaders or &quot;penghulu&quot; (noblemen) for a particular tribe. When the title is bestowed, it is celebrated with a traditional ceremony (&quot;Malewa Gala&quot;) and a banquet.

Unlike other Malay traditions, the title of &quot;datuk&quot; in Minangkabau is inherited according to the matrilineal system. When a &quot;datuk&quot; dies his title may pass to his brother or nephew, whoever is closest in the maternal line. If there is no maternal relative, it may be given to another tribal member with the agreement of the tribe.

In the tradition of the Toba Batak people, a datu is magician-priest who teach divination and magic via his book the pustaha.

<text>Tooter Turtle is an American animated television series about a turtle which first appeared on TV in 1960, as a segment of the &quot;King Leonardo and His Short Subjects&quot; program. &quot;Tooter Turtle&quot; debuted on NBC, on Saturday, October 15, 1960, and ran for 39 original episodes through July 22, 1961. These episodes were later rerun as backups on other cartoon shows, but no more original episodes were made.

==Plot==
The plots followed the same general format. Tooter (voiced by Allen Swift) calls on his friend Mr. Wizard the Lizard (voiced by Sandy Becker), an anthropomorphic lizard wearing a wizard cone hat, a robe, and pince-nez eyeglasses. Mr. Wizard lived in a tiny cardboard box at the base of a tall tree. The introductory segment had Tooter knocking on the cardboard box, having &quot;another favor to ask.&quot; From inside the box, Mr. Wizard would shrink Tooter small enough to enter through the box&#x27;s front door and invite him in. Mr. Wizard has the magic to change Tooter&#x27;s life to some other destiny, usually sending him back in time and to various locales.

As Tooter is fulfilling his destiny, Mr. Wizard narrates the story. When Tooter&#x27;s trip finally became a catastrophe, Tooter would request help with a cry of &quot;Help me, Mr. Wizard, I don&#x27;t want to be X any more!&quot; where X was whatever destiny Tooter had entered. Mr. Wizard would then rescue Tooter with the incantation, &quot;Drizzle, Drazzle, Druzzle, Drome, time for this one to come home.&quot; Then, Mr. Wizard would always give Tooter the same advice: &quot;Be just what you is, not what you is not. Folks what do this has the happiest lot.&quot;

==Critical reception and impact==

Mr. Wizard&#x27;s phrase &quot;Drizzle, Drazzle, Druzzle, Drome; Time for this one to come home&quot; is echoed in the phrase &quot;Razzle, dazzle, drazzle, drone, Time for This One to Come Home&quot; that was used later by the band The Replacements as a lyric in &quot;Hold My Life&quot; from the album &quot;Tim&quot;.

Created and aired during the Vietnam War, although before the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the episode featuring Tooter traveling back to World War I as a fighter pilot (&quot;Tailspin Tooter&quot;) includes what one historian has called some of &quot;the most gruesome pro-war imagery&quot; in cartoons of the period.

The 1984 novel &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; includes childhood recollections of the cartoon series by a narrator while in a similar predicament.

In the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, Neo (Keanu Reeves) calls his operator Tank for an exit from the Matrix, saying, &quot;Mr. Wizard, get me the hell out of here!&quot;.

<doc id="658952" wikidata="Q3795210" url="?curid=658952" title="Treason's Harbour">
<text>Treason&#x27;s Harbour is the ninth historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by British author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1983. The story is set during the Napoleonic Wars.

While with Captain Jack Aubrey awaiting repairs on his ship in Malta, Stephen Maturin discovers that the island is home to a ruthless network of French spies. An unwilling French informer needs help from Maturin, who discovers her predicament and helps her. Meanwhile, a new Admiral arrives at Malta. He sends Aubrey on three missions across the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, one on borrowed ships, and two of the missions are traps. Aubrey escapes the predicaments, but Admiral Harte dies when his ship of the line is destroyed in an ambush. The high level double agent whose existence Maturin begins to suspect does not succeed in undoing either Maturin or Aubrey, yet.

After the reissue of the novel in 1992, it received strong praise. In mentioning the dramatic fate of Mr Hairabedian, one reviewer wryly states that nothing happens in the novel, but the novels are &quot;filled with real people doing real things, brilliantly imagined and conveyed in crisp, clear, strong writing.&quot; Another gives negative reviews to a particular narrator of an audio version by praising O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s writing: &quot;characters&#x27; voices lack consistency and sensitivity to the subtleties of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s pen&quot;; and yet more strongly, &quot;The narrative turns from nefarious intrigues in Malta to an amazing mission in the Red Sea and back again, but the drama is [not] conveyed . . .&quot;

==Plot summary==

The Surprises wait at Malta while their ship is slowly repaired after their successful mission on the Ionian coast. Aubrey and Maturin meet Mrs Laura Fielding at music parties she holds. She is waiting for news of her husband, a naval lieutenant who is a prisoner-of-war in France. One of the three groups of French intelligence agents in Malta uses Fielding&#x27;s plight to manipulate her into spying for them. Aubrey saves her huge dog Ponto from a fall in the cistern. This endears Aubrey to Ponto, leading the gossips of Malta to assume he is carrying on an affair with Mrs Fielding. She asks Maturin to help her satisfy the French agents. They let it appear to the French spies as if they are conducting an affair, and Maturin prepares false materials for her to pass on. The new Commander of the Mediterranean fleet, Admiral Sir Francis Ives and acting second secretary Andrew Wray, arrive in Malta with their own advisor on Turkish affairs. Once Aubrey learns that an earlier prize was accepted by the board, he has money to speed up repairs on &quot;Surprise&quot;. Before he leaves Malta, Graham describes Lesueur, a French agent known to him. Unbeknownst to Maturin, Wray meets with Lesueur, receives payments from him and learns what Maturin has done to French spies. Maturin is delighted to receive his diving bell, built on Edmond Halley&#x27;s design. He and Heneage Dundas test it out from Dundas’s ship. It travels with Maturin on the next mission.

Aubrey is dispatched on a secret mission by Admiral Ives to capture a Turkish galley laden with French silver in the Red Sea. They sail on the &quot;Dromedary&quot; to Tina, and then walk across the Sinai Peninsula to meet the HEI ship &quot;Niobe&quot; at Suez. Aubrey takes command of &quot;Niobe&quot; in the Red Sea, with Turkish troops to aid on land. They spot the galley and give chase. Aubrey notices that the galley is using a drag sail to artificially slow its speed. Realizing the trickery, Aubrey sinks the galley to deny the French its silver. Maturin and Aubrey use the diving bell to retrieve the cargo, but find it is lead not silver, a complete trap. The galley had been in the sea for a month awaiting them, to lure them under French cannons on land. They reverse the challenging journey, offloading the disappointed Turkish troops at Suez, then cross the desert with no escort. Bedouin horsemen steal their camel train, so they reach Tina exhausted. Only Aubrey’s chest, with his chelengk award and the dead dragoman’s papers, is saved by Killick’s diligent effort. They return to Malta on &quot;Dromedary&quot;.

Admiral Ives tells Aubrey the sad news that &quot;Surprise&quot; is to return to England to be sold out of the service. Maturin is in a mood to gamble at cards. Wray loses a large sum of money to Maturin playing piquet, and is unable to pay his debt. Maturin asks for naval favors in return, like a ship for recently-promoted Pullings. Before dispatching &quot;Surprise&quot; to England, Ives asks Aubrey to take the Adriatic convoy up to Trieste, where he meets Captain Cotton of HMS &quot;Nymphe&quot;. &quot;Nymphe&quot; has just rescued the escaped prisoner-of-war, Lieutenant Charles Fielding. Maturin removes a bullet from the brave and jealous man. He hears the rumour of Aubrey&#x27;s liaison with his wife and refuses to return to Malta on &quot;Surprise,&quot; challenging Aubrey to a duel when they next meet on land. On the return journey Captain Dundas, on HMS &quot;Edinburgh&quot;, tells Aubrey of a French privateer, which Aubrey then captures with &quot;Dryad&quot; in convoy. The chase delays &quot;Surprise&quot; into Malta, so the news of Lieutenant Fielding&#x27;s rescue has begun to circulate. Maturin speeds to Mrs Fielding&#x27;s house, but she is not home. Lesueur and Boulay, a double agent on the Governor&#x27;s staff, arrive to kill her, as she is of no more use to them, and have already killed Ponto. Maturin quietly listens to their conversation until they leave. When she arrives, he takes her aboard the &quot;Surprise&quot;, saving her life.

Admiral Ives orders Aubrey to sail to Zambra on the Barbary Coast to persuade the Dey of Mascara not to molest British ships, in convoy with HMS &quot;Pollux&quot;, which is returning Admiral Harte to England. While &quot;Pollux&quot; waits at the entrance of the Bay of Zambra, the French &quot;Mars&quot; with two frigates fire on her, with a fierce ensuing battle. &quot;Pollux&quot; blows up, killing all 500 aboard, but not before she severely damages &quot;Mars&quot;. The two frigates chase &quot;Surprise&quot; deep into the bay until the heavier frigate runs aground on a reef. Her smaller consort deserts the fight. On the political advice of Maturin, Aubrey sets sail for Gibraltar. This ambush on a voyage known to so few makes it clear that someone highly placed in the British command betrayed them to the French. Maturin hopes Wray will find the traitor out and destroy the French spy networks.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the third of eleven novels (beginning with &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;) that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Title==

The title is drawn from a line in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, Henry VI: &#x27;Smoothe runnes the Water, where the Brooke is deepe. And in his simple shew he harbours Treason.&#x27; (It is also written: Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep / And in his simple show he harbours treason.) 2 Henry VI, a speech by Suffolk.

==Reviews==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, reviewing an inadequate audio book narrator, commends the series in the highest terms, and is sharply critical of the narrator&#x27;s inability to properly convey the main characters. They said of the series and the novel &quot;what is certainly the greatest series about the British Navy ever written--indeed, one of the most successful of its magnitude ever written in any genre&quot;. Of the reader of this audio book, they said &quot;Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre actor Pigott-Smith has an appropriately English accent, but his characters&#x27; voices lack consistency and sensitivity to the subtleties of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s pen.&quot;, a rather sharp criticism. Further, readers of this series &quot;will despair at hearing how this production tramples upon his genius in portraying shockingly real characters in an utterly foreign, far-off time.&quot;

Patrick Reardon, writing in the Chicago Tribune when the paperback was issued in the US, mentions the incident of Mr Hairabedian&#x27;s abrupt demise. In assessing that shocking scene and the crew&#x27;s reaction to it, Reardon says that &quot;Not much happens in O`Brian`s books, not much, that is, in the sense of battles and great drama. But his novels are filled with real people doing real things, brilliantly imagined and conveyed in crisp, clear, strong writing.&quot;

==Narrative style==
Most of the novels in the series tell the story exclusively from the point of view of Maturin or Aubrey, either through descriptions through their eyes, direct conversations, their internal thoughts, or their letters and diary entries. In essence, the reader usually knows only what one or both of the two main characters know.

In &quot;Treason’s Harbour&quot;, however, O&#x27;Brian tells some of the story through conversations between the French agent Lesueur and Andrew Wray or other confederates in Malta, conversations that the protagonists neither hear nor overhear. Thus from the opening pages of the novel, the reader is aware that Wray, the acting second secretary of the British Admiralty, is secretly accepting money and taking orders from France. When Aubrey&#x27;s mission to the Red Sea is a total failure, and again when Aubrey, Maturin, and Admiral Harte are sent on a suicide mission to the Barbary Coast, Aubrey begins to quietly doubt his luck, but the reader knows that he has been a victim of Wray&#x27;s plots.

As the plot unfolds, Maturin gradually realizes that there must be a traitor in the upper echelons of the British Admiralty. But again unlike the reader, he does not know the traitor&#x27;s identity as the novel comes to a close. In fact, one of his last actions in the book is to write a letter to Wray detailing his suspicions and describing the French spy network in Malta.

Norton issued &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot; nine years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., who asked O&#x27;Brian to write the first book in the series, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; published in 1969. Collins picked it up in the UK, and continued to publish each novel as O&#x27;Brian completed another story. Beginning with &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; in 1991, the novels were released at about the same time in the USA (by W W Norton) and the UK (by HarperCollins, the name of Collins after a merger).

Novels prior to 1992 were published rapidly in the US for that new market. Following novels were released at the same time by the UK and US publishers. Collins asked Geoff Hunt in 1988 to illustrate the covers of the twelve books already published by then, with &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; being the first book to have Hunt&#x27;s work on the first edition. He continued to paint the covers for future books; the covers were used on both USA and UK editions. Reissues of earlier novels used the Geoff Hunt covers.
