<text>The Norden Mk. XV, known as the Norden M series in U.S. Army service, is a bombsight that was used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the United States Navy during World War II, and the United States Air Force in the Korean and the Vietnam Wars. It was an early tachometric design, which combined optics, a mechanical computer, and an autopilot for the first time to not merely identify a target but fly the airplane to it. The bombsight directly measured the aircraft&#x27;s ground speed and direction, which older types could only estimate with lengthy manual procedures. The Norden further improved on older designs by using an analog computer that continuously recalculated the bomb&#x27;s impact point based on changing flight conditions, and an autopilot that reacted quickly and accurately to changes in the wind or other effects.

Together, these features promised unprecedented accuracy for daytime bombing from high altitudes. During prewar testing the Norden demonstrated a circular error probable (CEP), an astonishing performance for that period. This precision would enable direct attacks on ships, factories, and other point targets. Both the Navy and the USAAF saw it as a means to conduct successful high-altitude bombing. For example, an invasion fleet could be destroyed long before it could reach U.S. shores.

To protect these advantages, the Norden was granted the utmost secrecy well into the war, and was part of a production effort on a similar scale to the Manhattan Project: the overall cost (both R&amp;D and production) was $1.1 billion, as much as 2/3 of the latter or over a quarter of the production cost of all B-17 bombers. The Norden was not as secret as believed; both the British SABS and German Lotfernrohr 7 worked on similar principles, and details of the Norden had been passed to Germany even before the war started.

Under combat conditions the Norden did not achieve its expected precision, yielding an average CEP in 1943 of , similar to other Allied and German results. Both the Navy and Air Forces had to give up using pinpoint attacks. The Navy turned to dive bombing and skip bombing to attack ships, while the Air Forces developed the lead bomber procedure to improve accuracy, and adopted area bombing techniques for ever-larger groups of aircraft. Nevertheless, the Norden&#x27;s reputation as a pin-point device endured, due in no small part to Norden&#x27;s own advertising of the device after secrecy was reduced late in the war.

The Norden saw reduced use in the post–World War II period after radar-based targeting was introduced, but the need for accurate daytime attacks kept it in service, especially during the Korean War. The last combat use of the Norden was in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s VO-67 squadron, which used it to drop sensors onto the Ho Chi Minh Trail in 1967. The Norden remains one of the best-known bombsights.

==History and development==

===Early work===
The Norden sight was designed by Carl Norden, a Dutch engineer educated in Switzerland who immigrated to the U.S. in 1904. In 1911, Norden joined Sperry Gyroscope to work on ship gyrostabilizers, and then moved to work directly for the U.S. Navy as a consultant. At the Navy, Norden worked on a catapult system for a proposed flying bomb that was never fully developed, but this work introduced various Navy personnel to Norden&#x27;s expertise with gyro stabilization.

World War I bomb sight designs had improved rapidly, with the ultimate development being the Course Setting Bomb Sight, or CSBS. This was essentially a large mechanical calculator that directly represented the wind triangle using three long pieces of metal in a triangular arrangement. The hypotenuse of the triangle was the line the aircraft needed to fly along in order to arrive over the target in the presence of wind, which, before the CSBS, was an intractable problem. Almost all air forces adopted some variation of the CSBS as their standard inter-war bomb sight, including the U.S. Navy, who used a modified version known as the Mark III.

It was already realized that one major source of error in bombing was levelling the aircraft enough so the bombsight pointed straight down, even small errors in levelling could produce dramatic errors in accuracy. The US Army did not adopt the CSBS and instead used a simpler design, the Estoppey D-series, as it automatically levelled the sight during use. Navy experiments showed these roughly doubled accuracy, so they began a series of developments to add a gyroscopic stabilizer to their bombsights. In addition to new designs like the Inglis (working with Sperry) and Seversky, Norden was asked to provide an external stabilizer for the Navy&#x27;s existing Mark III designs.

===Mark III-A===

Although the CSBS and similar designs allowed the calculation of the proper flight angle needed to correct for windage, they did so by looking downward out of the aircraft. Very simple bombsights could be operated by the pilot, but as their sophistication grew they demanded full-time operators. This task was often given to the front or rear gunner. In Army aircraft they would sit near enough to the pilot to indicate any required directional adjustments using hand signals, or if they sat behind the pilot, using strings attached to the pilot&#x27;s jacket.

The Navy&#x27;s first bombers were large flying boats, where the pilot sat well away from the front of the fuselage, and one could not simply cut a hole for the bombsight to view through. Instead, the bombs were normally aimed by an observer in the nose of the aircraft. This made communications with the pilot very difficult. To address this, the Navy developed the concept of the pilot direction indicator, or PDI, an electrically-driven pointer that the observer used to indicate which direction to turn. The bombardier used switches to move the pointer on his unit to indicate the direction of the target, which was duplicated on the unit in front of the pilot so he could maneuver the aircraft to follow suit.

Norden&#x27;s attempt to fit a stabilizer to the Mark III, the Mark III-A, also included a separate contract to develop a new automatic PDI. Norden proposed removing the electrical switches used to move the pointer and using the entire bombsight itself as the indicator. In place of the thin metal wires that formed the sights on the Mark III, a small low-power telescope would be used in its place. The bombardier would rotate the telescope left or right to follow the target. This motion would cause the gyros to precess, and this signal would drive the PDI automatically. The pilot would follow the PDI as before.

Norden initially delivered three prototypes of the stabilized bombsight without the automatic PDI. In testing, the Navy found that while the system did improve accuracy when it worked, it was complicated to use and often failed, leaving the real-world accuracy no better than before. They asked Norden for suggestions on ways to improve this. They were still interested in the PDI work, and the contract was allowed to continue.

===Mark XI===
Norden suggested that the only solution to improve accuracy would be to directly measure the ground speed, as opposed to calculating it using the CSBS&#x27;s wind triangle. To time the drop, Norden used an idea already in use on other bombsights, the &quot;equal distance&quot; concept. This was based on the observation that the time needed to travel a certain distance over the ground would remain relatively constant during the bomb run, as the wind would not be expected to change dramatically over a short period of time. If you could accurately mark out a distance on the ground, or in practice, an angle in the sky, timing the passage over that distance would give you all the information needed to time the drop.

Norden&#x27;s version of the system was very similar to the Army&#x27;s Estoppey D-4 of the same era, differing largely in the physical details of the actual sights. The D-4 used thin wires as the sights, while Norden&#x27;s would use the small telescope of the Mark III-A. To use the system, the bombardier looked up the expected time it would take for the bombs to fall from the current altitude. This time was set into a countdown stopwatch, and the sights were set to the angle that the bombs would fall if there was no wind. The bombardier waited for the target to line up with a crosshair in the telescope. When it did, the timer was started, and the bombardier rotated the telescope around its vertical axis to track the target as they flew toward it. This movement was linked to a second crosshair through a gearing system. The bombardier continued moving the telescope until the timer ran out. The second crosshair was now at the correct aiming angle, or &quot;range angle&quot;, after accounting for any difference between groundspeed and airspeed. The bombardier then waited for the target to pass through the second crosshair to time the drop.

In 1924, the first prototype of this design, known to the Navy as the Mark XI, was delivered to the Navy&#x27;s proving grounds in Virginia. In testing, the system proved disappointing. The circular error probable (CEP), a circle into which 50% of the bombs would fall, was wide from only altitude. This was an error of over 3.6%, somewhat worse than existing systems. Moreover, bombardiers universally complained that the device was far too hard to use. Norden worked tirelessly on the design, and by 1928, the accuracy had improved to 2% of altitude. This was enough for the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ordnance to place a US$348,000 contract (equivalent to $ million in ) for 80 production examples.

Norden was known for his confrontational and volatile nature. He often worked 16-hour days and thought little of anyone who did not. Navy officers began to refer to him as &quot;Old Man Dynamite&quot;. During development, the Navy asked Norden to consider taking on a partner to handle the business and leave Norden free to develop the engineering side. They recommended former Army colonel Theodore Barth, an engineer who had been in charge of gas mask production during World War I. The match-up was excellent, as Barth had the qualities Norden lacked: charm, diplomacy, and a head for business. The two became close friends.

===Initial U.S. Army interest===
In December 1927, the United States Department of War was granted permission to use a bridge over the Pee Dee River in North Carolina for target practice, as it would soon be sunk in the waters of a new dam. The 1st Provisional Bombardment Squadron, equipped with Keystone LB-5 bombers, attacked the bridge over a period of five days, flying 20 missions a day in perfect weather and attacking at altitudes from . After this massive effort, the middle section of the bridge finally fell on the last day. However, the effort as a whole was clearly a failure in any practical sense.

About the same time as the operation was being carried out, General James Fechet replaced General Mason Patrick as commander of the USAAC. He received a report on the results of the test, and on 6 January 1928 sent out a lengthy memo to Brigadier General William Gillmore, chief of the Material Division at Wright Field, stating:

He went on to request information on every bombsight then used at Wright, as well as &quot;the Navy&#x27;s newest design&quot;. However, the Mark XI was so secret that Gillmore was not aware Fechet was referring to the Norden. Gilmore produced contracts for twenty-five examples of an improved version of the Seversky C-1, the C-3, and six prototypes of a new design known as the Inglis L-1. The L-1 never matured, and Inglis later helped Seversky to design the improved C-4.

The wider Army establishment became aware of the Mark XI in 1929 and was eventually able to buy an example in 1931. Their testing mirrored the Navy&#x27;s experience; they found that the gyro stabilization worked and the sight was accurate, but it was also &quot;entirely too complicated&quot; to use. The Army turned its attention to further upgraded versions of their existing prototypes, replacing the older vector bombsight mechanisms with the new synchronous method of measuring the proper dropping angle.

===Fully automatic bombsight===
While the Mk. XI was reaching its final design, the Navy learned of the Army&#x27;s efforts to develop a synchronous bombsight, and asked Norden to design one for them. Norden was initially unconvinced this was workable, but the Navy persisted and offered him a development contract in June 1929. Norden retreated to his mother&#x27;s house in Zürich and returned in 1930 with a working prototype. Lieutenant Frederick Entwistle, the Navy&#x27;s chief of bombsight development, judged it revolutionary.

The new design, the Mark XV, was delivered in production quality in the summer of 1931. In testing, it proved to eliminate all of the problems of the earlier Mk. XI design. From altitude the prototype delivered a CEP of , while even the latest production Mk. XI&#x27;s were . At higher altitudes, a series of 80 bomb runs demonstrated a CEP of . In a test on 7 October 1931, the Mk. XV dropped 50% of its bombs on a static target, the USS &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, while a similar aircraft with the Mk. XI had only 20% of its bombs hit.

Moreover, the new system was dramatically simpler to use. After locating the target in the sighting system, the bombardier simply made fine adjustments using two control wheels throughout the bomb run. There was no need for external calculation, lookup tables or pre-run measurementseverything was carried out automatically through an internal wheel-and-disc calculator. The calculator took a short time to settle on a solution, with setups as short as six seconds, compared to the 50 needed for the Mk. XI to measure its ground speed. In most cases, the bomb run needed to be only 30 seconds long.

Despite this success, the design also demonstrated several serious problems. In particular, the gyroscopic platform had to be levelled out before use using several spirit levels, and then checked and repeatedly reset for accuracy. Worse, the gyros had a limited degree of movement, and if the plane banked far enough the gyro would reach its limit and have to be re-set from scratch – something that could happen even due to strong turbulence. If the gyros were found to be off, the levelling procedure took as long as eight minutes. Other minor problems were the direct current electric motors which drove the gyroscopes, whose brushes wore down quickly and left carbon dust throughout the interior of the device, and the positioning of the control knobs, which meant the bombardier could only adjust side-to-side or up-and-down aim at a time, not both. But despite all of these problems, the Mark XV was so superior to any other design that the Navy ordered it into production.

Carl L. Norden Company was incorporated in 1931, supplying the sights under a dedicated source contract. In effect, the company was owned by the Navy. In 1934 the newly-forming GHQ Air Force, the purchasing arm of the U.S. Army Air Corps, selected the Norden for their bombers as well, referring to it as the M-1. However, due to the dedicated source contract, the Army had to buy the sights from the Navy. This was not only annoying for inter-service rivalry reasons, but the Air Corps&#x27; higher-speed bombers demanded several changes to the design, notably the ability to aim the sighting telescope further forward to give the bombardier more time to set up. The Navy was not interested in these changes, and would not promise to work them into the production lines. Worse, Norden&#x27;s factories were having serious problems keeping up with demand for the Navy alone, and in January 1936, the Navy suspended all shipments to the Army.

===Autopilot===
Mk. XV&#x27;s were initially installed with the same automatic PDI as the earlier Mk. XI. In practice, it was found that the pilots had a very difficult time keeping the aircraft stable enough to match the accuracy of the bombsight. Starting in 1932 and proceeding in fits and starts for the next six years, Norden developed the Stabilized Bombing Approach Equipment (SBAE), a mechanical autopilot that attached to the bombsight. However, it was not a true &quot;autopilot&quot;, in that it could not fly the aircraft by itself. By rotating the bombsight in relationship to the SBAE, the SBAE could account for wind and turbulence and calculate the appropriate directional changes needed to bring the aircraft onto the bomb run far more precisely than a human pilot. The minor adaptations needed on the bombsight itself produced what the Army referred to as the M-4 model.

In 1937 the Army, faced with the continuing supply problems with the Norden, once again turned to Sperry Gyroscope to see if they could come up with a solution. Their earlier models had all proved unreliable, but they had continued working with the designs throughout this period and had addressed many of the problems. By 1937, Orland Esval had introduced a new AC-powered electrical gyroscope that spun at 30,000 RPM, compared to the Norden&#x27;s 7,200 , which dramatically improved the performance of the inertial platform. The use of three-phase AC power and inductive pickup eliminated the carbon brushes, and further simplified the design. Carl Frische had developed a new system to automatically level the platform, eliminating the time-consuming process needed on the Norden. The two collaborated on a new design, adding a second gyro to handle heading changes, and named the result the Sperry S-1. Existing supplies of Nordens continued to be supplied to the USAAC&#x27;s B-17s, while the S-1 equipped the B-24Es being sent to the 15th Air Force.

Some B-17s had been equipped with a simple heading-only autopilot, the Sperry A-3. The company had also been working on an all-electronic model, the A-5, which stabilized in all three directions. By the early 1930s, it was being used in a variety of Navy aircraft to excellent reviews. By connecting the outputs of the S-1 bombsight to the A-5 autopilot, Sperry produced a system similar to the M-4/SBAE, but it reacted far more quickly. The combination of the S-1 and A-5 so impressed the Army that on 17 June 1941 they authorized the construction of a factory and noted that &quot;in the future all production models of bombardment airplanes be equipped with the A-5 Automatic Pilot and have provisions permitting the installation of either the M-Series [Norden] Bombsight or the S-1 Bombsight&quot;.

===British interest, Tizard mission===
By 1938, information about the Norden had worked its way up the Royal Air Force chain of command and was well known within that organization. The British had been developing a tachometric bombsight of their own known as the Automatic Bomb Sight, but combat experience in 1939 demonstrated the need for it to be stabilized. Work was underway as the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight (SABS), but it would not be available until 1940 at the earliest, and likely later. Even then, it did not feature the autopilot linkage of the Norden, and would thus find it difficult to match the Norden&#x27;s performance in anything but smooth air. Acquiring the Norden became a major goal.

The RAF&#x27;s first attempt, in the spring of 1938, was rebuffed by the U.S. Navy. Air Chief Marshal Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, commanding RAF Bomber Command, demanded Air Ministry action. They wrote to George Pirie, the British air attaché in Washington, suggesting he approach the U.S. Army with an offer of an information exchange with their own SABS. Pirie replied that he had already looked into this, and was told that the U.S. Army had no licensing rights to the device as it was owned by the U.S. Navy. The matter was not helped by a minor diplomatic issue that flared up in July when a French air observer was found to be on board a crashed Douglas Aircraft Company bomber, forcing President Roosevelt to promise no further information exchanges with foreign powers.

Six months later, after a change of leadership within the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics, on 8 March 1939, Pirie was once again instructed to ask the U.S. Navy about the Norden, this time enhancing the deal with offers of British power-operated turrets. However, Pirie expressed concern as he noted the Norden had become as much political as technical, and its relative merits were being publicly debated in Congress weekly while the U.S. Navy continued to say the Norden was &quot;the United States&#x27; most closely guarded secret&quot;.

The RAF&#x27;s desires were only further goaded on 13 April 1939, when Pirie was invited to watch an air demonstration at Fort Benning where the painted outline of a battleship was the target:

The three following B-17s also hit the target, and then a flight of a dozen Douglas B-18 Bolos placed most of their bombs in a separate square outlined on the ground.

Another change of management within the Bureau of Aeronautics had the effect of making the U.S. Navy more friendly to British overtures, but no one was willing to fight the political battle needed to release the design. The Navy brass was concerned that giving the Norden to the RAF would increase its chances of falling into German hands, which could put the U.S.&#x27;s own fleet at risk. The UK Air Ministry continued increasing pressure on Pirie, who eventually stated there was simply no way for him to succeed, and suggested the only way forward would be through the highest diplomatic channels in the Foreign Office. Initial probes in this direction were also rebuffed. When a report stated that the Norden&#x27;s results were three to four times as good as their own bombsights, the Air Ministry decided to sweeten the pot and suggested they offer information on radar in exchange. This too was rebuffed.

The matter eventually worked its way to the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, who wrote personally to President Roosevelt asking for the Norden, but even this was rejected. The reason for these rejections was more political than technical, but the U.S. Navy&#x27;s demands for secrecy were certainly important. They repeated that the design would be released only if the British could demonstrate the basic concept was common knowledge, and therefore not a concern if it fell into German hands. The British failed to convince them, even after offering to equip their examples with a variety of self-destruct devices.

This may have been ameliorated by the winter of 1939, at which point a number of articles about the Norden appeared in the U.S. popular press with reasonably accurate descriptions of its basic workings. But when these were traced back to the press corps at the U.S. Army Air Corps, the U.S. Navy was apoplectic. Instead of accepting it was now in the public domain, any discussion about the Norden was immediately shut down. This drove both the British Air Ministry and Royal Navy to increasingly anti-American attitudes when they considered sharing their own developments, notably newer ASDIC systems. By 1940 the situation on scientific exchange was entirely deadlocked as a result.

Looking for ways around the deadlock, Henry Tizard sent Archibald Vivian Hill to the U.S. to take a survey of U.S. technical capability in order to better assess what technologies the U.S. would be willing to exchange. This effort was the start on the path that led to the famous Tizard Mission in late August 1940. Ironically, by the time the Mission was being planned, the Norden had been removed from the list of items to be discussed, and Roosevelt personally noted this was due largely to political reasons. Ultimately, although Tizard was unable to convince the U.S. to release the design, he was able to request information about its external dimensions and details on the mounting system so it could be easily added to British bombers if it were released in the future.

===Production, problems, and Army standardization===
The conversion of Norden Laboratories Corporation&#x27;s New York City engineering lab to a production factory was a long process. Before the war, skilled craftsmen, most of them German or Italian immigrants, hand-made almost every part of the 2,000-part machine. Between 1932 and 1938, the company produced only 121 bombsights per year. During the first year after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Norden produced 6,900 bombsights, three-quarters of which went to the U.S. Navy.

When Norden heard of the U.S. Army&#x27;s dealings with Sperry, Theodore Barth called a meeting with the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy at their factory in New York City. Barth offered to build an entirely new factory just to supply the U.S. Army, but the U.S. Navy refused this. Instead, the U.S. Army suggested that Norden adapt their sight to work with Sperry&#x27;s A-5, which Barth refused. Norden actively attempted to make the bombsight incompatible with the A-5.

It was not until 1942 that the impasse was finally solved by farming out autopilot production to Honeywell Regulator, who combined features of the Norden-mounted SBAE with the aircraft-mounted A-5 to produce what the U.S. Army referred to as &quot;Automatic Flight Control Equipment&quot; (AFCE); the unit would later be redesigned as the C-1. The Norden, now connected with the aircraft&#x27;s built-in autopilot, allowed the bombardier alone to fully control minor movements of the aircraft during the bombing run.

By May 1943 the U.S. Navy was complaining that they had a surplus of devices, with full production turned over to the USAAF. After investing more than $100 million in Sperry bombsight manufacturing plants, the USAAF concluded that the Norden M-series was far superior in accuracy, dependability, and design. Sperry contracts were cancelled in November 1943. When production ended a few months later, 5,563 Sperry bombsight-autopilot combinations had been built, most of which were installed in Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers.

Expansion of Norden bombsight production to a final total of six factories took several years. The USAAF demanded additional production to meet their needs, and eventually arranged for the Victor Adding Machine company to gain a manufacturing license, and then Remington Rand. Ironically, during this period the U.S. Navy abandoned the Norden in favor of dive bombing, reducing the demand. By the end of the war, Norden and its subcontractors had produced 72,000 M-9 bombsights for the U.S. Army Air Force alone, costing $8,800 each.

==Description and operation==
===Background===
Typical bombsights of the pre-war era worked on the &quot;vector bombsight&quot; principle introduced with the World War I Course Setting Bomb Sight. These systems consisted of a slide rule-type calculator that was used to calculate the effects of the wind on the bomber based on simple vector arithmetic. The mathematical principles are identical to those on the E6B calculator used to this day.

In operation, the bombardier would first take a measurement of the wind speed using one of a variety of methods, and then dial that speed and direction into the bombsight. This would move the sights to indicate the direction the plane should fly to take it directly over the target with any cross-wind taken into account, and also set the angle of the iron sights to account for the wind&#x27;s effect on ground speed.

These systems had two primary problems in terms of accuracy. The first was that there were several steps that had to be carried out in sequence in order to set up the bombsight correctly, and there was limited time to do all of this during the bomb run. As a result, the accuracy of the wind measurement was always limited, and errors in setting the equipment or making the calculations were common. The second problem was that the sight was attached to the aircraft, and thus moved about during maneuvers, during which time the bombsight would not point at the target. As the aircraft had to maneuver in order to make the proper approach, this limited the time allowed to accurately make corrections. This combination of issues demanded a long bomb run.

Experiments had shown that adding a stabilizer system to a vector bombsight would roughly double the accuracy of the system. This would allow the bombsight to remain level while the aircraft maneuvered, giving the bombardier more time to make his adjustments, as well as reducing or eliminating mis-measurements when sighting off of non-level sights. However, this would not have any effect on the accuracy of the wind measurements, nor the calculation of the vectors. The Norden attacked all of these problems.

===Basic operation===
To improve the calculation time, the Norden used a mechanical computer inside the bombsight to calculate the range angle of the bombs. By simply dialing in the aircraft&#x27;s altitude and heading, along with estimates of the wind speed and direction (in relation to the aircraft), the computer would automatically, and quickly, calculate the aim point. This not only reduced the time needed for the bombsight setup but also dramatically reduced the chance for errors. This attack on the accuracy problem was by no means unique; several other bombsights of the era used similar calculators. It was the way the Norden used these calculations that differed.

Conventional bombsights are set up pointing at a fixed angle, the range angle, which accounts for the various effects on the trajectory of the bomb. To the operator looking through the sights, the crosshairs indicate the location on the ground the bombs would impact if released at that instant. As the aircraft moves forward, the target approaches the crosshairs from the front, moving rearward, and the bombardier releases the bombs as the target passes through the line of the sights. One example of a highly automated system of this type was the RAF&#x27;s Mark XIV bomb sight.

The Norden worked in an entirely different fashion, based on the &quot;synchronous&quot; or &quot;tachometric&quot; method. Internally, the calculator continually computed the impact point, as was the case for previous systems. However, the resulting range angle was not displayed directly to the bombardier or dialed into the sights. Instead, the bombardier used the sighting telescope to locate the target long in advance of the drop point. A separate section of the calculator used the inputs for altitude and airspeed to determine the angular velocity of the target, the speed at which it would be seen drifting backward due to the forward motion of the aircraft. The output of this calculator drove a rotating prism at that angular speed in order to keep the target centered in the telescope. In a properly adjusted Norden, the target remains motionless in the sights.

The Norden thus calculated two angles: the range angle based on the altitude, airspeed and ballistics; and the current angle to the target, based on the ground speed and heading of the aircraft. The difference between these two angles represented the &quot;correction&quot; that needed to be applied to bring the aircraft over the proper drop point. If the aircraft was properly aligned with the target on the bomb run, the difference between the range and target angles would be continually reduced, eventually to zero (within the accuracy of the mechanisms). At this moment the Norden automatically dropped the bombs.

In practice, the target failed to stay centered in the sighting telescope when it was first set up. Instead, due to inaccuracies in the estimated wind speed and direction, the target would drift in the sight. To correct for this, the bombardier would use fine-tuning controls to slowly cancel out any motion through trial and error. These adjustments had the effect of updating the measured ground speed used to calculate the motion of the prisms, slowing the visible drift. Over a short period of time of continual adjustments, the drift would stop, and the bombsight would now hold an extremely accurate measurement of the exact ground speed and heading. Better yet, these measurements were being carried out on the bomb run, not before it, and helped eliminate inaccuracies due to changes in the conditions as the aircraft moved. And by eliminating the manual calculations, the bombardier was left with much more time to adjust his measurements, and thus settle at a much more accurate result.

The angular speed of the prism changes with the range of the target: consider the reverse situation, the apparent high angular speed of an aircraft passing overhead compared to its apparent speed when it is seen at a longer distance. In order to properly account for this non-linear effect, the Norden used a system of slip-disks similar to those used in differential analysers. However, this slow change at long distances made it difficult to fine-tune the drift early in the bomb run. In practice, bombardiers would often set up their ground speed measurements in advance of approaching the target area by selecting a convenient &quot;target&quot; on the ground that was closer to the bomber and thus had more obvious motion in the sight. These values would then be used as the initial setting when the target was later sighted. 

===System description===
The Norden bombsight consisted of two primary parts, the gyroscopic stabilization platform on the left side, and the mechanical calculator and sighting head on the right side. They were essentially separate instruments, connecting through the sighting prism. The sighting eyepiece was located in the middle, between the two, in a less than convenient location that required some dexterity to use.

Before use, the Norden&#x27;s stabilization platform had to be &quot;righted&quot;, as it slowly drifted over time and no longer kept the sight pointed vertically. Righting was accomplished through a time-consuming process of comparing the platform&#x27;s attitude to small spirit levels seen through a glass window on the front of the stabilizer. In practice, this could take as long as eight and a half minutes. This problem was made worse by the fact that the platform&#x27;s range of motion was limited, and could be &quot;tumbled&quot; even by strong turbulence, requiring it to be reset again. This problem seriously upset the usefulness of the Norden, and led the RAF to reject it once they received examples in 1942. Some versions included a system that quickly righted the platform, but this &quot;Automatic Gyro Leveling Device&quot; proved to be a maintenance problem, and was removed from later examples.

Once the stabilizer was righted, the bombardier would then dial in the initial setup for altitude, speed, and direction. The prism would then be &quot;clutched out&quot; of the computer, allowing it to be moved rapidly to search for the target on the ground. Later Nordens were equipped with a reflector sight to aid in this step. Once the target was located the computer was clutched in and started moving the prism to follow the target. The bombardier would begin making adjustments to the aim. As all of the controls were located on the right, and had to be operated while sighting through the telescope, another problem with the Norden is that the bombardier could only adjust either the vertical or horizontal aim at a given time, his other arm was normally busy holding himself up above the telescope.

On top of the device, to the right of the sight, were two final controls. The first was the setting for &quot;trail&quot;, which was pre-set at the start of the mission for the type of bombs being used. The second was the &quot;index window&quot; which displayed the aim point in numerical form. The bombsight calculated the current aim point internally and displayed this as a sliding pointer on the index. The current sighting point, where the prism was aimed, was also displayed against the same scale. In operation, the sight would be set far in advance of the aim point, and as the bomber approached the target the sighting point indicator would slowly slide toward the aim point. When the two met, the bombs were automatically released. The aircraft was moving over , so even minor interruptions in timing could dramatically affect aim.

Early examples, and most used by the Navy, had an output that directly drove a Pilot Direction Indicator meter in the cockpit. This eliminated the need to manually signal the pilot, as well as eliminating the possibility of error.

In U.S. Army Air Forces use, the Norden bombsight was attached to its autopilot base, which was in turn connected with the aircraft&#x27;s autopilot. The Honeywell C-1 autopilot could be used as an autopilot by the flight crew during the journey to the target area through a control panel in the cockpit, but was more commonly used under direct command of the bombardier. The Norden&#x27;s box-like autopilot unit sat behind and below the sight and attached to it at a single rotating pivot. After control of the aircraft was passed to the bombardier during the bomb run, he would first rotate the entire Norden so the vertical line in the sight passed through the target. From that point on, the autopilot would attempt to guide the bomber so it followed the course of the bombsight, and pointed the heading to zero out the drift rate, fed to it through a coupling. As the aircraft turned onto the correct angle, a belt and pulley system rotated the sight back to match the changing heading. The autopilot was another reason for the Norden&#x27;s accuracy, as it ensured the aircraft quickly followed the correct course and kept it on that course much more accurately than the pilots could.

Later in the war, the Norden was combined with other systems to widen the conditions for successful bombing. Notable among these was the radar system called the H2X (Mickey), which were used directly with the Norden bombsight. The radar proved most accurate in coastal regions, as the water surface and the coastline produced a distinctive radar echo.

==Combat use==

===Early tests===
The Norden bombsight was developed during a period of United States non-interventionism when the dominant U.S. military strategy was the defense of the U.S. and its possessions. A considerable amount of this strategy was based on stopping attempted invasions by sea, both with direct naval power, and starting in the 1930s, with USAAC airpower. Most air forces of the era invested heavily in dive bombers or torpedo bombers for these roles, but these aircraft generally had limited range; long-range strategic reach would require the use of an aircraft carrier. The Army felt the combination of the Norden and B-17 Flying Fortress presented an alternate solution, believing that small formations of B-17s could successfully attack shipping at long distances from the USAAC&#x27;s widespread bases. The high altitudes the Norden allowed would help increase the range of the aircraft, especially if equipped with a turbocharger, as with each of the four Wright Cyclone 9 radial engines of the B-17.

In 1940, Barth claimed that &quot;we do not regard a 15 foot (4.6 m) square... as being a very difficult target to hit from an altitude of &quot;. At some point the company started using the pickle barrel imagery, to reinforce the bombsight&#x27;s reputation. After the device became known about publicly in 1942, the Norden company in 1943 rented Madison Square Garden and folded their own show in between the presentations of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Their show involved dropping a wooden &quot;bomb&quot; into a pickle barrel, at which point a pickle popped out.

These claims were greatly exaggerated; in 1940 the average score for an Air Corps bombardier was a circular error of from , not from . Real-world performance was poor enough that the Navy de-emphasized level attacks in favor of dive bombing almost immediately. The Grumman TBF Avenger could mount the Norden, like the preceding Douglas TBD Devastator, but combat use was disappointing and eventually described as &quot;hopeless&quot; during the Guadalcanal Campaign. In spite of giving up on the device in 1942, bureaucratic inertia meant they were supplied as standard equipment until 1944.

USAAF anti-shipping operations in the Far East were generally unsuccessful. In early operations during the Battle of the Philippines, B-17s claimed to have sunk one minesweeper and damaged two Japanese transports, the cruiser , and the destroyer . However, all of these ships are known to have suffered no damage from air attack during that period. In other early battles, including the Battle of Coral Sea or Battle of Midway, no claims were made at all, although some hits were seen on docked targets. The USAAF eventually replaced all of their anti-shipping B-17s with other aircraft, and came to use the skip bombing technique in direct low-level attacks.

===Air war in Europe===

As U.S. participation in the war started, the U.S. Army Air Forces drew up widespread and comprehensive bombing plans based on the Norden. They believed the B-17 had a 1.2% probability of hitting a target from , meaning that 220 bombers would be needed for a 93% probability of one or more hits. This was not considered a problem, and the USAAF forecast the need for 251 combat groups to provide enough bombers to fulfill their comprehensive pre-war plans.

After earlier combat trials proved troublesome, the Norden bombsight and its associated AFCE were used on a wide scale for the first time on the 18 March 1943 mission to Bremen-Vegesack, Germany. The 303d Bombardment Group dropped 76% of its load within a ring, representing a CEP well under . As at sea, many early missions over Europe demonstrated varied results; on wider inspection, only 50% of American bombs fell within a of the target, and American flyers estimated that as many as 90% of bombs could miss their targets. The average CEP in 1943 was , meaning that only 16% of the bombs fell within of the aiming point. A bomb, standard for precision missions after 1943, had a lethal radius of only .

Faced with these poor results, Curtis LeMay started a series of reforms in an effort to address the problems. In particular, he introduced the &quot;combat box&quot; formation in order to provide maximum defensive firepower by densely packing the bombers. As part of this change, he identified the best bombardiers in his command and assigned them to the lead bomber of each box. Instead of every bomber in the box using their Norden individually, the lead bombardiers were the only ones actively using the Norden, and the rest of the box&#x27;s aircraft dropped their bombs when they saw the lead&#x27;s bombs leaving his aircraft. Although this spread the bombs over the area of the combat box, this could still improve accuracy over individual efforts. It also helped stop a problem where various aircraft, all slaved to their autopilots on the same target, would drift into each other. These changes did improve accuracy, which suggests that much of the problem is attributable to the bombardier. However, true &quot;precision&quot; attacks still proved difficult or impossible.

When Jimmy Doolittle took over command of the 8th Air Force from Ira Eaker in early 1944, precision bombing attempts were dropped. Area bombing, like the RAF efforts, were widely used with 750 and then 1,000-bomber raids against large targets. The main targets were railroad marshaling yards (27.4% of the bomb tonnage dropped), airfields (11.6%), oil refineries (9.5%), and military installations (8.8%). To some degree, the targets themselves were secondary; Doolittle used the bombers as an irresistible target to draw up Luftwaffe fighters into the ever-increasing swarms of Allied long-range escort fighters. As these missions broke the Luftwaffe, missions were able to be carried out at lower altitudes or especially in bad weather when the H2X radar could be used. In spite of abandoning precision attacks, accuracy nevertheless improved. By 1945, the 8th was putting up to 60% of its bombs within , a CEP of about .

Still pursuing precision attacks, various remotely guided weapons were developed, notably the AZON and VB-3 Razon bombs and similar weapons.

===Adaptations===

The Norden operated by mechanically turning the viewpoint so the target remained stationary in the display. The mechanism was designed for the low angular rate encountered at high altitudes, and thus had a relatively low range of operational speeds. The Norden could not rotate the sight fast enough for bombing at low altitude, for instance. Typically this was solved by removing the Norden completely and replacing it with simpler sighting systems.

A good example of its replacement was the refitting of the Doolittle Raiders with a simple iron sight. Designed by Capt. C. Ross Greening, the sight was mounted to the existing pilot direction indicator, allowing the bombardier to make corrections remotely, like the bombsights of an earlier era.

However, the Norden combined two functions, aiming and stabilization. While the former was not useful at low altitudes, the latter could be even more useful, especially if flying in rough air near the surface. This led James &quot;Buck&quot; Dozier to mount a Doolittle-like sight on top of the stabilizer in the place of the sighting head in order to attack German submarines in the Caribbean Sea. This proved extraordinarily useful and was soon used throughout the fleet.

===Postwar use===
In the postwar era, the United States mostly stopped developing new precision bombsights. Initially this was because of the war&#x27;s end but, as budgets increased during the Cold War, the deployment of nuclear weapons meant accuracies of around were sufficient, well within the capabilities of existing radar bombing systems. Only one major bombsight of note was developed, the Y-4 developed on the Boeing B-47 Stratojet. This sight combined the images of the radar and a lens system in front of the aircraft, allowing them to be directly compared at once through a binocular eyepiece.

Bombsights on older aircraft, like the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the later B-50, were left in their wartime state. When the Korean War began, these aircraft were pressed into service and the Norden once again became the USAF&#x27;s primary bombsight. This occurred again when the Vietnam War started; in this case retired World War II technicians had to be called up in order to make the bombsights operational again. Its last use in combat was by the Naval Air Observation Squadron Sixty-Seven (VO-67), during the Vietnam War. The bombsights were used in Operation Igloo White for implanting Air-Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detectors (ADSID) along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

==Wartime security==
Since the Norden was considered a critical wartime instrument, bombardiers were required to take an oath during their training stating that they would defend its secret with their own life if necessary. In case the plane should make an emergency landing on enemy territory, the bombardier would have to shoot the important parts of the Norden with a gun to disable it. The Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bomber was originally equipped with flotation bags in the wings to aid the aircrew&#x27;s escape after ditching, but they were removed once the Pacific War began; this ensured that the aircraft would sink, taking the Norden with it.

After each completed mission, bomber crews left the aircraft with a bag which they deposited in a safe (&quot;the Bomb Vault&quot;). This secure facility (&quot;the AFCE and Bombsight Shop&quot;) was typically in one of the base&#x27;s Nissen hut (Quonset hut) support buildings. The Bombsight Shop was manned by enlisted men who were members of a Supply Depot Service Group (&quot;Sub Depot&quot;) attached to each USAAF bombardment group. These shops not only guarded the bombsights but performed critical maintenance on the Norden and related control equipment. This was probably the most technically skilled ground-echelon job, and certainly the most secret, of all the work performed by Sub Depot personnel. The non-commissioned officer in charge and his staff had to have a high aptitude for understanding and working with mechanical devices.

As the end of World War II neared, the bombsight was gradually downgraded in its secrecy; however, it was not until 1944 that the first public display of the instrument occurred.

===Espionage===

Despite the security precautions, the entire Norden system had been passed to the Germans before the war started. Herman W. Lang, a German spy, had been employed by the Carl L. Norden Company. During a visit to Germany in 1938, Lang conferred with German military authorities and reconstructed plans of the confidential materials from memory. In 1941, Lang, along with the 32 other German agents of the Duquesne Spy Ring, was arrested by the FBI and convicted in the largest espionage prosecution in U.S. history. He received a sentence of 18 years in prison on espionage charges and a two-year concurrent sentence under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

German instruments were fairly similar to the Norden, even before World War II. A similar set of gyroscopes provided a stabilized platform for the bombardier to sight through, although the complex interaction between the bombsight and autopilot was not used. The Carl Zeiss Lotfernrohr 7, or Lotfe 7, was an advanced mechanical system similar to the Norden bombsight, although in form it was more similar to the Sperry S-1. It started replacing the simpler Lotfernrohr 3 and BZG 2 in 1942, and emerged as the primary late-war bombsight used in most &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; level bombers. The use of the autopilot allowed single-handed operation, and was key to bombing use of the single-crewed Arado Ar 234.

Japanese forces captured examples of the Norden, primarily from North American B-25 Mitchell bombers. They developed a simplified and more compact version known as the Type 4 Automatic Bombing Sight, but found it too complex to mass produce. Further development led to the Type 1 Model 2 Automatic Bombing Sight which began limited production just before the end of the war. Approximately 20 were in service at the end of the war.

===Postwar analysis===
Postwar analysis placed the overall accuracy of daylight precision attacks with the Norden at about the same level as radar bombing efforts. The 8th Air Force put 31.8% of its bombs within from an average altitude of , the 15th Air Force averaged 30.78% from , and the 20th Air Force against Japan averaged 31% from .

Many factors have been put forth to explain the Norden&#x27;s poor real-world performance. Over Europe, the cloud cover was a common explanation, although performance did not improve even in favorable conditions. Over Japan, bomber crews soon discovered strong winds at high altitudes, the so-called jet streams, but the Norden bombsight worked only for wind speeds with minimal wind shear. Additionally, the bombing altitude over Japan reached up to , but most of the testing had been done well below . This extra altitude compounded factors that could previously be ignored; the shape of and even the paint on the bomb changed its aerodynamic properties and, at that time, nobody knew how to calculate the trajectory of bombs that reached supersonic speeds during their fall.

The RAF developed their own designs. Having moved to night bombing, where visual accuracy was difficult under even the best conditions, they introduced the much simpler Mark XIV bomb sight. This was designed not for accuracy above all, but ease of use in operational conditions. In testing in 1944, it was found to offer a CEP of , about what the Norden was offering at that time. This led to a debate within the RAF whether to use their own tachometric design, the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight, or use the Mk. XIV on future bombers. The Mk. XIV ultimately served into the 1960s while the SABS faded from service as the Lancaster and Lincoln bombers fitted with it were retired by the late 1940s.

<doc id="640048" wikidata="Q21592125" url="?curid=640048" title="Rhythm 0">
<text>Rhythm 0 was a six-hour long endurance art performance by the Serbian performance artist Marina Abramović performed in Naples in 1974. The work involved Abramović standing still while the audience was invited to do to her whatever they wished, using one of 72 objects she had placed on a table. These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, a gun, and a bullet.

There were no separate stages. Abramović and the visitors stood in the same space, making it clear that the latter were part of the work. The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: &quot;What is the public about and what are they going to do in this kind of situation?&quot;

==Performance==
Her instructions were: 

Abramović said the work &quot;pushed her body to the limits&quot;. Visitors were gentle to begin with, offering her a rose or a kiss. Art critic Thomas McEvilley, who was present, wrote:

As Abramović described it later: &quot;What I learned was that ... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you ... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.&quot;

In the work, Marina explored the physical and mental limits of her being. In this she withstood pain, exhaustion, and danger in her exploration of an emotional and spiritual transformation. This performance was inspired by the contradictions of her childhood: both parents were high-ranking officials in the socialist government, while her grandmother, with whom she had lived, was devoutly Serbian Orthodox. 

==Reception==

&quot;Rhythm 0&quot; ranked ninth among the all-time best performance art pieces in a 2013 list by &quot;Complex&quot; magazine.

In 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; revisited Abramovic’s work and its continuing relevance today: “As some of the reviews of her RA show revealed, Abramović’s performance art practice still invites scepticism, even disgust – reactions to which she is long accustomed. She told me: “When I started in the early 70s, everyone said we were crazy. ‘This is not art, it’s nothing.’” By using the body as her medium, Abramović shows just how close art can get to life. As spectators of her work, we are also implicated in the reality of what people endure. Rhythm 0 is a shattering reminder of the people who live in fear of abuse daily.”

&quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; in a 2023 article notes in regards to the audience’s reception of the piece: “One of the main reactions the audience members aimed to elicit was fear, reflecting the power dynamics at play between the artist and the audience. The audience members were aware that there would be no consequences for their actions against Abramović. This lack of consequence contributed to their increased willingness to use the objects in more extreme ways.”

<doc id="640074" wikidata="Q921887" url="?curid=640074" title="Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&#x27;Erlon (; 29 July 176525 January 1844) was a Marshal of France and a soldier in the Grande Armée during the Napoleonic Wars. He notably commanded the I Corps of the &quot;Army of the North&quot; at the Battle of Waterloo.

==Early life==
D&#x27;Erlon was born in Reims on 29 July 1765. His father and grandfather were carpenters, and he trained to be a locksmith.

==Revolutionary Wars==
D&#x27;Erlon entered the army as a private soldier in 1782, was discharged after five years’ service and re-entered it in 1792. In 1792 he served as a corporal in the pre-revolutionary army, being elected to captain the following year.

From 1794 to 1796 he was aide-de-camp to General Lefebvre. In 1799 he was promoted to brigadier general, and fought under André Masséna in Switzerland. The same year he distinguished himself at the Second Battle of Zurich.

He continued his service in many battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, including the Battle of Hohenlinden (3rd December 1800, in which he was wounded), the Hanover region (earning him promotion to general of division equivalent to major general in 1803).

==Napoleonic Wars==
As a general of division he took part in Napoleon&#x27;s campaigns of 1805 and 1806. At the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, his division played a pivotal role, and he rendered excellent service at Jena in 1806.

In 1807, as chief of staff for Lefebvre at the siege of Danzig (now Gdańsk), he negotiated the terms of surrender. The same year he was wounded in the foot at Friedland. After this battle he was made grand officer of the Legion of Honour, was created Count d’Erlon and received a pension.

Following the conclusion of the 1809 Danubian campaign, D&#x27;Erlon was sent as chief of staff to Marshal Lefebvre. Lefebvre was in command of the VII (Bavarian) Corps in action in the Tyrolean Rebellion against the pro-Austrian insurgency led by the innkeeper Andreas Hofer. After the failure of the allied second offensive to retake the Tyrol, Lefebvre was relieved of his command by Napoleon because of his poor performance and terrible relationship with the Bavarians. D&#x27;Erlon was given command, and in by the end of November he had pacified the region, and in the process formed a strong bond with his Bavarian subordinates.

For the next six years d&#x27;Erlon was almost continuously engaged as commander of an army corps in the Peninsular War, in which he added greatly to his reputation as a capable general. He arrived in the Peninsula as commander of the IX Corps, and at the pass of Maya in the Pyrenees defeated the British General Hill. In the subsequent battles of the 1814 campaign he distinguished himself further.

After Napoleon abdicated in 1814 d&#x27;Erlon transferred his allegiance to the House of Bourbon along with the rest of the army and was given command of the 16th military division, but he was soon arrested for conspiring with the Orléans party, to which he was secretly devoted. He escaped and joined Napoleon, who had returned from exile on the island of Elba.

==Hundred Days==

Napoleon made him a peer of France, and gave him command of the I Corps, which formed part of the Army of the North. On 16 June 1815 during the first major engagements of Waterloo campaign, due to conflicting orders his Corps spent the day on the Old Roman Road marching and counter-marching between the battles of Quatre Bras and Ligny without engaging in either battle. He was not, however, held to account by Napoleon, and as the latter&#x27;s practice in such matters was severe to the verge of injustice, it may be presumed that the failure was not due to d’Erlon. If the I Corps had engaged in either battle the outcome of the campaign might have been different.

Two days later at the Battle of Waterloo it was his Corps in column formation which attacked the Allied centre right from La Haye Sainte to Papelotte at 13:30 and was stopped by Picton&#x27;s Peninsular War veterans, and then attacked in the flanks by the British heavy cavalry. He retreated with the rest of the French army and fought in the closing operations around Paris. After the surrender of Napoleon, d&#x27;Erlon entered exile in Munich where he established a brewery.

==Post-Napoleonic service==
In 1825 he was granted amnesty by Charles X. He supported July Revolution in 1830, and was made Peer of France in 19 November 1831. In 1832 he was given the command of the 12th Division in Nantes. Later in the year his division suppressed a Vendean revolt and arrested the Duchess of Berry.

In 1834 d&#x27;Erlon was named governor-general of Algeria. After the defeat of the French army under General Trézel at the Battle of Macta in 1835, public outcry at the disaster resulted in D&#x27;Erlon being recalled to France and replaced by General Clauzel.

From 1837 he resumed his command of the 12th Division in Nantes, a position he held until 1843 when he moved to Paris to retire and was granted the title marshal of France on 9 April 1843. He died on 25 January of the following year.

==Family==
In 1794, in Reims, d&#x27;Erlon married Marie-Anne de Rousseau (died 1828), daughter of Nicolas de Rousseau, a banker, whom he got to know through Marie-Jeanne (Rousseau) the wife of his brother Jean-François Drouet. While in Reims on the morning of his wedding, he was informed of his appointment as aide-de-camp to General François Lefebvre. On Christmas Day 1794, his first child, a son who was christened Nicolas Adolphe, was born. In 1796 his wife had their second child, a daughter: Marie-Anne Louise. His third child Aimé-Napoleon-François was born in Soissons in December 1803.

<text>GHOST (an acronym for &quot;general hardware-oriented system transfer&quot;), now called [[Symantec Security|Symantec]]™ GHOST Solution Suite (GSS) for enterprise, is a disk cloning and backup tool originally developed by Murray Haszard in 1995 for Binary Research. The technology was bought in 1998 by Symantec.

The backup and recovery feature was replaced by Symantec System Recovery (SSR).

Broadcom bought Symantec&#x27;s Enterprise Security business in 2019. 

== Features ==
GHOST is marketed as an OS (Operating System) deployment solution. Its capture and deployment environment requires booting to a Windows PE environment. This can be accomplished by creating an ISO (to burn to a DVD) or a USB bootable disk, installed to a client as an automation folder or delivered by a PXE server. This provides an environment to perform offline system recovery or image creation. GHOST can mount a backup volume to recover individual files.

GHOST can copy the contents of one volume to another or copy a volume&#x27;s contents to a virtual disk in VMDK or VHD format.

Initially, GHOST supported only the FAT file system, but could only copy (not resize) other file systems by performing a sector-by-sector transfer. GHOST added support for NTFS later in 1996, and also provided a program, Ghostwalker, to change the Security ID (SID) that made Windows NT systems distinguishable from each other. Ghostwalker is capable of modifying the name of the Windows NT computer from its own interface. GHOST added support for the EXT2 file system in 1999 and for EXT3 subsequently. Support for EXT4 was added in September 2017 (Enterprise only).

== Early versions ==
Binary Research developed GHOST in Auckland, New Zealand. After the Symantec acquisition, a few functions (such as translation into other languages) were moved elsewhere, but the main development remained in Auckland until October 2009 at which time much was moved to India.

Technologies developed by 20/20 Software were integrated into GHOST after their acquisition by Symantec in April 2000.

=== GHOST 1.0 and 2.0 ===
GHOST 1.0 and 1.1 were released in 1996, followed by 2.0 (2.07) in the same year. These versions supported only the cloning of entire disks. They could run on an IBM XT and without extended memory. They also worked with OS/2.

=== GHOST 3.1 ===
Version 3.1, released in 1997 supports cloning individual partitions. GHOST could clone a disk or partition to another disk or partition or to an image file. GHOST allows for writing a clone or image to a second disk in the same machine, another machine linked by a parallel or network cable, a network drive, or to a tape drive. 3.1 uses 286 with XMS and could still run on OS/2.

=== GHOST 4.0 and 4.1 ===
Version 4.0 of GHOST added multicast technology, following the lead of a competitor, ImageCast. Multicasting supports sending a single backup image simultaneously to other machines without putting greater stress on the network than by sending an image to a single machine. This version also introduced GHOST Explorer, a Windows program which supports browsing the contents of a disk image file and extracting individual files from it. Explorer was subsequently enhanced to support adding and deleting files in a FAT-formatted image, and later with EXT2, EXT3 and NTFS file systems. Until 2007, GHOST Explorer could not edit NTFS images. GHOST Explorer could work with images from older versions but only slowly; version 4 images contain indexes to find files rapidly.

Version 4.0 also moved from real-mode DOS to 286 protected mode via Pharlap Extender. The additional memory available allows GHOST to provide several levels of compression for images, and to provide the file browser. In 1998, GHOST 4.1 supports password-protected images. This version dropped OS/2 support.

=== GHOST 5.0 (GHOST 2000) ===
Version 5.0 moved to 386 protected mode. Unlike the text-based user interface of earlier versions, 5.0 uses a graphical user interface (GUI). The Binary Research logo, two stars revolving around each other, plays on the main screen when the program is idle. In 1998, Gdisk, a script-based partition manager, was integrated in Ghost. Gdisk serves a role similar to Fdisk, but has greater capabilities.

=== GHOST for NetWare ===
A Norton GHOST version for Novell NetWare (called 2.0), released around 1999, supports NSS partitions (although it runs in DOS, like the others).

=== GHOST 6.0 (GHOST 2001) ===
GHOST 6.0, released in 2000, includes a management console for managing large numbers of machines. The console communicates with client software on managed computers and allows a system administrator to refresh the disk of a machine remotely. As a DOS-based program, GHOST requires machines running Windows to reboot to DOS to run it. GHOST 6.0 requires a separate DOS partition when used with the console.

=== GHOST 7.0 / GHOST 2002 ===
Released March 31, 2001, Norton GHOST version 7.0 (retail) was marketed as Norton GHOST 2002 Personal Edition.

=== GHOST 7.5 ===
Released December 14, 2001, GHOST 7.5 creates a virtual partition, a DOS partition which actually exists as a file within a normal Windows file system. This significantly eased systems management because the user no longer had to set up their own partition tables. GHOST 7.5 can write images to CD-R discs. Later versions can write DVDs.

=== Symantec GHOST 8.0 ===
GHOST 8.0 can run directly from Windows. It is well-suited for placement on bootable media, such as BartPE′s bootable CD. The corporate edition supports unicast, multicast and peer-to-peer transfers via TCP/IP. GHOST 8.0 supports NTFS file system, although NTFS is not accessible from a DOS program.

=== Transition from DOS ===
The off-line version of Ghost, which runs from bootable media in place of the installed operating system, originally faced a number of driver support difficulties due to limitations of the increasingly obsolete 16-bit DOS environment. Driver selection and configuration within DOS was non-trivial from the beginning, and the limited space available on floppy disks made disk cloning of several different disk controllers a difficult task, where different SCSI, USB, and CD-ROM drives were involved. Mouse support was possible but often left out due to the limited space for drivers on a floppy disk. Some devices such as USB often did not work using newer features such as USB 2.0, instead only operating at 1.0 speeds and taking hours to do what should have taken only a few minutes. As widespread support for DOS went into decline, it became increasingly difficult to get hardware drivers for DOS for the newer hardware.

Disk imaging competitors to GHOST have dealt with the decline of DOS by moving to other recovery environments such as FreeBSD, Linux or Windows PE, where they can draw on current driver development to be able to image newer models of disk controllers. Nevertheless, the DOS version of GHOST on compatible hardware configurations works much faster than most of the *nix based image and backup tools.

GHOST 8 and later are Windows programs; as such, they can run on Windows PE, BartPE or Hiren&#x27;s BootCD and use the same plug and play hardware drivers as a standard desktop computer, making hardware support for GHOST much simpler.

=== Norton GHOST 2003 ===
Norton GHOST 2003, a consumer edition of Ghost, was released on September 6, 2002. Available as an independent product, Norton GHOST 2003 was also included as a component of Norton SystemWorks 2003 Professional. A simpler, non-corporate version of Ghost, Norton GHOST 2003 does not include the console but has a Windows front-end to script GHOST operations and create a bootable GHOST diskette. The machine still needs to reboot to the virtual partition, but the user does not need to interact with DOS. Symantec deprecated LiveUpdate support for Norton GHOST 2003 in early 2006.

== Acquisition of PowerQuest ==
At the end of 2003, Symantec acquired its largest competitor in the disk-cloning field, PowerQuest. On August 2, 2004, Norton GHOST 9.0 was released as a new consumer version of Ghost, which is based on PowerQuest&#x27;s Drive Image version 7, and provides Live imaging of a Windows system. GHOST 9 continues to leverage the PowerQuest (v2i) file format, meaning it is not backward compatible with previous versions of Ghost. However, a version of GHOST 8.0 is included on the GHOST 9 recovery disk to support existing GHOST customers.

GHOST split into two code bases following the acquisition of PowerQuest. The consumer line uses PowerQuest&#x27;s V2I technology, while the enterprise line builds upon the original GHO format.

== Consumer line ==

=== Norton GHOST 9.0 (includes GHOST 2003) ===
GHOST 9.0 was released August 2, 2004. It represents a significant shift in the consumer product line from GHOST 2003, in several ways:
* It uses a totally different code base, based on the DriveImage/V2i Protector product via Symantec&#x27;s acquisition of PowerQuest.
* It is a Windows program that must be installed on the target system.
* Images can be made while Windows is running, rather than only when booted directly into DOS mode.
* Incremental images (containing only changes since the last image) are supported.
* Requires Product Activation in order to function fully.
* The bootable environment on the GHOST 9 CD is only useful for recovery of existing backups. It cannot be used to create new images.

Since GHOST 9 does not support the older .gho format disk images, a separate CD containing GHOST 2003 is included in the retail packaging for users needing to access those older images.

The limitations of GHOST 9 compared to GHOST 2003 were not well-communicated by Symantec, and resulted in many dissatisfied customers who purchased GHOST 9 expecting the previous version&#x27;s features (like making images from the bootable GHOST environment, no installation required, and no product activation).

=== Norton GHOST 10.0 ===
Released circa 2005. Supports creating images on CDs, DVDs, Iomega Zip and Jaz disks as well as IEEE 1394 (FireWire) and USB mass storage devices. Supports encrypting images and Maxtor external hard disk drives with Maxtor OneTouch buttons. GHOST 10.0 is compatible with previous versions, but not with future versions.

=== Norton Save And Restore 1.0 (GHOST 10.0) ===
Norton Save And Restore 1.0, released in February 2006, was the renamed consumer version of Ghost. It used GHOST 10.0&#x27;s engine, with the addition of features to allow backup and restoration of individual files.

=== Norton GHOST 12.0 ===
GHOST 12.0 (April 2007) includes Windows Vista support with an updated and more thorough user interface. It supports both full system backup and individual files or folders backup.

This version provides a &quot;LightsOut Restore&quot; feature, which restores a system from an on-disk software recovery environment similar to Windows RE, thereby allowing recovery without a bootable CD. Upon system startup, a menu asks whether start the operating system or the LightsOut recovery environment. LightsOut restore would augment the ISO image, which comes with Ghost. The latter contains a recovery environment that can recover a system without a working operating system.

=== Norton Save &amp; Restore 2.0 (GHOST 13.0) ===
NSR 2.0 has fewer features in comparison to Norton GHOST 12. NSR 2.0 offers one-time backups, file and folder backup, simplified schedule editor, Maxtor OneTouch integration and modifiable Symantec recovery disc. This version supports 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP and Vista.

=== Norton GHOST 14.0 ===
Version 14.0 (November 2007) uses Volume Snapshot Service (VSS) to make backups and can store backups to an FTP site. GHOST can connect to ThreatCon, a Symantec service that monitors malware activity around the world, and performs incremental backups when a specific threat level is reached. Other features include the ability to back up to network-attached storage devices and support for NTFS partitions up to 16TB. GHOST can manage other installations of version 12.0 or later across a network.

This version no longer supports opening .gho image files. It stores images in .v2i format. Incremental backup images created with Norton GHOST are saved with .iv2i filename extensions alone the original full backup (with .v2i filename extension) on a regular basis. Older .gho image files can be restored using GHOST Explorer, a separate utility.

=== Norton GHOST 15.0 ===
According to the Norton community on Symantec&#x27;s site, the following features are available in Norton GHOST 15 of April 2010:

=== Discontinuation ===
Norton GHOST was discontinued on April 30, 2013. Support via chat and knowledge base was available until June 30, 2014. Until it was removed, the Symantec GHOST Web page invited GHOST customers to try Symantec System Recovery, described as software for backup and disaster recovery.

== Enterprise line ==

=== Symantec GHOST Solution Suite 1.0 (GHOST 8.2) ===

Released November 15, 2004, Symantec renamed the Enterprise version of GHOST to &quot;Symantec GHOST Solution Suite 1.0&quot;. This helped clarify the difference between the consumer and business editions of the product. According to Symantec, Symantec GHOST and Norton GHOST are two separate product lines based around different technologies developed by different teams. This was further defined in February 2006, with the release of Norton Save And Restore (also known as &quot;Norton Backup And Restore&quot;), a standalone backup application based on GHOST 10.0.

=== Symantec GHOST Solution Suite 1.1 (GHOST 8.3) ===
GHOST Solution Suite 1.1 was released in December 2005. GHOST Solution Suite 1.1 is a bundle of an updated version of Ghost, Symantec Client Migration (a user data and settings migration tool) and the former PowerQuest equivalent, DeployCenter (using PQI images). It can create an image file that is larger than 2 GB. (In GHOST 8.2 or earlier, such image files are automatically split into two or more segments, so that each segment has a maximum size of 2 GB.) Other new features include more comprehensive manufacturing tools, and the ability to create a &quot;universal boot disk&quot;.

=== Symantec GHOST Solution Suite 2.0 (GHOST 11.0) ===
GHOST Solution Suite 2.0 was released in November 2006. This version provides significant improvements in performance, as well as the ability to edit NTFS images. This version also adds support for Windows Vista, x64 versions of Windows, and GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks. However, the software does not fully support systems with Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) firmware.

GHOST 11.0 supports saving and restoring from native GHOST image format (.gho, .ghs) and raw images (.img, .raw).

=== Symantec GHOST Solution Suite 2.5 (GHOST 11.5) ===
The GHOST software for enterprise, including GHOST 11.5, was released in May 2008. New features include:
As of January 6, 2010, the latest build from Live Update is 11.5.1.2266 (Live Update 5 (LU5)). This updates GHOST Solution Suite to 2.5.1 and provides support for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Furthermore, GHOST 11.5 is compatible with BartPE&#x27;s bootable CD using a PE Builder plug-in for Symantec GHOST 11

=== Symantec GHOST Solution Suite 3.x (GHOST 12.0) ===
GSS 3.0, including GHOST 12.0 and Deployment Solution 6.9, was announced in March 2015.

GSS 3.1, including GHOST 12.0 and Deployment Solution 6.9, was released on 7 March 2016.

GSS 3.2, including GHOST 12.0 and Deployment Solution 6.9, was released on 18 May 2017. Release Update 3, which was released 22 September 2017, added support for the ext4 filesystem.

GSS 3.3, including GHOST 12.0 and Deployment Solution 6.9, was released on 31 October 2018. This release added support for GHOST Solution Suite Web Console, iPXE, Windows Server 2016, Smart raw imaging, and 4K native drive support.

<doc id="640084" wikidata="Q2934644" url="?curid=640084" title="Grey-backed camaroptera">
<text>The grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brevicaudata) is a small bird in the family Cisticolidae. This bird is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Recent studies suggest this species and the green-backed camaroptera may be the same species.

This skulking passerine is typically found low in dense cover. The grey-backed camaroptera binds large leaves together low in a bush and builds a grass nest within the leaves. The normal clutch is two or three eggs.

This long warbler has grey upper parts and a grey short cocked tail. The wings are olive and the underparts whitish grey. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are paler yellow on the breast.

Like most warblers, grey-backed camaroptera is insectivorous. The call is a whining and a bleating &quot;maa&quot;, that gave rise to its previous name &quot;bleating warbler&quot; or &quot;bleating camaroptera&quot;. The song is a crisp .

The grey-backed camaroptera was described by the German physician and zoologist Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar in 1830 under the binomial name &quot;Sylvia brevicaudata&quot;. The type locality is the former province of Kurdufan in Sudan. The specific epithet &quot;brevicaudata&quot; is from Latin &quot;brevis&quot; for &quot;short&quot; and &quot;caudatus&quot; for &quot;-tailed&quot;. There are 11 recognised subspecies.

<doc id="640098" wikidata="Q173329" url="?curid=640098" title="History of Formula One">
<text>Formula One automobile racing has its roots in the European Grand Prix championships of the 1920s and 1930s, though the foundation of the modern Formula One began in 1946 with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s (FIA) standardisation of rules, which was followed by a World Championship of Drivers in 1950.

The sport&#x27;s history parallels the evolution of its technical regulations. In addition to the world championship series, non-championship Formula One races were held for many years, the last held in 1983 due to the rising cost of competition. National championships existed in South Africa and the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.

== History ==
=== Early years and continuation of pre-World War II supercharged engines (1946–1950) ===
Formula One was first defined in 1946 by the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) of the FIA, forerunner of FISA, as the premier single-seater racing category in worldwide motorsport to become effective in 1947. This new &quot;International Formula&quot; was initially known variously as Formula A, Formula I, or Formula 1 with the corresponding &quot;Voiturette&quot; formula being titled Formula B, Formula II, or Formula 2. When the 500cc formula was internationally recognised as Formula 3 in 1950 it was never titled as &quot;Formula C&quot; so the three International Formulae were then &quot;officially&quot; titled Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3.

In the beginning, the formula was largely based on pre-World War II regulations defined by engine capacity. The regulation expected to bring a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-litre pre-war Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the pre-war 1.5-litre supercharged &#x27;voiturettes&#x27;, while pre-war supercharged 3-litre Grand Prix cars were banned.

There is some debate as to what can be considered to be the first Formula 1 race. The first race under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix held on 1 September, the race being won by Achille Varzi in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta - but this was before the Formula was officially in place. The next contender is the 1947 Swedish Winter Grand Prix which was won by Reg Parnell driving an ERA - but this race was run on ice and some consider that it therefore was not a &quot;proper&quot; race (there is also some doubt whether it was a Formula 1 race or a Formule Libre race). The third claimant is the 1947 Pau Grand Prix which was won by Nello Pagani driving a Maserati 4CL, which is irrefutable.

Championships for drivers or constructors were not introduced immediately. In the early years there were around 20 races held from late Spring to early Autumn (Fall) in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Maserati. Races saw pre-war heroes like Rudolf Caracciola, Manfred Von Brauchitsch and Tazio Nuvolari end their careers, while drivers like Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio rose to the front.

=== Era of factory Italian and Mercedes front-engine cars (1950–1957) ===
The Motorcycle World Championships was introduced in 1949. In 1950, the FIA responded with the first ever official World Championship for Drivers. The championship series, to be held across six of the &#x27;major&#x27; Grands Prix of Europe plus the Indianapolis 500, was in effect a formalization of what had already been developing in Grand Prix racing during the previous years. Italian teams of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Maserati were best positioned to dominate the early years. Other national manufacturerssuch as the French manufacturer Talbot or the British BRMcompeted, although less successfully. A number of private cars also took part in local races. The Italian and German factory teams in those days often employed 2 to 3 drivers whose nationality was the same as the team&#x27;s and at least 1 foreign driver; for example the Alfa Romeo team in 1950 consisted of Italian drivers Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Fagioli and Piero Taruffi; and Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio.

Alfa Romeo dominated all before them in the 1950 season, winning every race but one in the championship with the pre-war &quot;Alfetta&quot; 158s. The sole exception was the Indianapolis 500, which was part of the championship (1950 to 1960), although not run to Formula One regulations and never contested by the teams that participated on the regular Formula One circuit (Alberto Ascari in 1952 and Juan Manuel Fangio in 1958 being the only regular Formula One drivers to bother with the Indianapolis 500 during this period). The Indianapolis 500 would never be important for Formula One and was no longer part of the championship after 1960. Nino Farina won the inaugural championship, Juan Manuel Fangio taking it in 1951 with the Alfa-Romeo 159, an evolution of the 158. The Alfetta&#x27;s engines were extremely powerful for their capacity: in 1951 the 159 engine was producing around but this was at the price of a fuel consumption of 125 to 175 litres per 100 km (2.26 to 1.61 mpg imp/1.88 mpg to 1.34 mpg US). Enzo Ferrari, who had raced the Alfettas before the war, and his engine designer Aurelio Lampredi, were the first to understand that the 1.5-litre supercharged engine was a dead end: any increase in power meant more fuel to carry or more time lost in the pits for refuelling, so for the last races of 1950 Ferrari sent his 1.5-litre supercharged 125s to the museum, and fielded the new V12 4.5-litre normally aspirated 375s. With a fuel consumption of around the 375s offered fierce opposition to the Alfettas towards the end of the 1951 season. Alfa Romeo, at the time a state-owned company, decided to withdraw after a refusal of the Italian government to fund the expensive design of a new car. Surprisingly, Alfa Romeo involvement in racing was made with a very thin budget, using mostly pre-war technology and material during the two seasons. For instance, the team won two championships using only nine pre-war built engine blocks.

No Alfa Romeo, a supporting cast of privateer Lago-Talbot entries and an almost undriveable, unreliable BRM would make Ferrari effectively invincible. The FIA was in an embarrassing position as it had already announced that current Formula One regulations would last until 1954 before switching to 2.5-litre atmospheric engines. Major manufacturers were already working to develop cars for the future regulation and it was obvious that nobody would develop a new car for only two years. The promoters of the World Championship Grands Prix, mindful of the lack of serious competition for the Alfettas, eventually all adopted Formula Two regulations for two years. However, Ferrari&#x27;s dominance went on with the light 4-cylinder powered 500s, bringing Italian Alberto Ascari his two championships in the 1952 and 1953 seasons. Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One cars continued to race very successfully in non-championship Formula One and Formula Libre races through this period. Ironically, during this period the only World Championship race for which Formula One cars were eligible was the Indianapolis 500. In 1952 Ferrari entered four Formula One 375s with Alberto Ascari as lead driver, but with little success.

Discounting the Indianapolis 500, the World Championship was entirely based in Europe until 1953 when the season opened in Argentina. Since then, there has always been at least one race outside Europe each year. As planned, the World Championship races returned to Formula One regulations for the 1954 season, now based on a new 2.5-litre atmospheric engine regulation. This successfully brought more entrants to the field. Lancia and Mercedes-Benz came to the formula, hiring the best drivers of the era: Ascari for Lancia, Fangio for Mercedes. Featuring desmodromic valves, fuel injection, magnesium and exotic alloys parts, &quot;streamlined&quot; bodywork and other advanced features, the brand new Mercedes began the 1954 season with Fangio taking pole position at the &quot;Grand Prix de l&#x27;ACF&quot; at Reims-Gueux with the first lap over in Formula One before winning the race after a duel with other Mercedes driver Karl Kling, who finished second.

The Mercedes cars swept the next two seasons with Fangio and Moss winning all but three of the races. However, at the end of the 1955 season Mercedes vanished as swiftly as they had come. They had proven the superiority of their technology, but the crash of one of their sportscars that year at Le Mans, killing 83 people, was also a significant factor. The company would not return to Formula One for forty years. After Le Mans, four of the year&#x27;s remaining Grands Prix were cancelled. The Monaco Grand Prix saw a spectacular incident when Ascari and his Lancia crashed into the harbour after missing a chicane. Ascari was pulled out of the water alive and apparently well. However, there was speculation over an undetected internal injury when four days later Ascari was killed at Monza while testing a sportscar. After Ascari&#x27;s death, Lancia followed Mercedes out of the category, passing their engines, cars, information and technology to Ferrari. The 1956 season saw Fangio make good use of the Lancia-born Ferrari to win his fourth championship. Driving for Maserati, he took his fifth championship in the 1957 season, a record which would not be beaten for 46 years. Ferrari developed a new engine for 1957, the V6 &quot;Dino&quot; engine, it was competitive by 1958 and Mike Hawthorn became the first British F1 World Champion, though his victory was short-lived: he died the following winter.

=== &quot;Garagistes&quot; and the rear-mid engine revolution (1958–1961) ===
:&quot;See 1958 season, 1959 season, 1960 season and 1961 season.&quot;

Although the basic formula remained unchanged in 1958, races were shortened from around 500 km/300miles to 300 km/200 miles and cars had to use avgas instead of various fuel mixtures using methanol as the primary component. 1958 saw the introduction of an International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, with points allocated on an 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 basis to the first six cars in the race (i.e. unlike in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, there was no point for fastest lap). Furthermore, points were only awarded to the highest placed car of each make, i.e. if a make finished 1st and 2nd they would receive only eight points and the 3rd placed car would receive 4 points. Indianapolis, which was included in the World Championship of Drivers (though no Formula One drivers competed), did not count towards the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers.

With Fangio retired, Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari took the Drivers&#x27; Championshipbecoming the first English driver to earn a title. The British Vanwall team took the maiden Constructors&#x27; Championship that season, but ruined their Drivers&#x27; Championship aspirations by taking points off one another. Stirling Moss, despite having many more wins than Hawthorn, lost the championship by one point. It was high sportsmanship that cost Moss the 1958 title. When Hawthorn was threatened with disqualification at the finish of the Portuguese Grand Prix for going in the wrong direction (to restart his car following a spin), Moss argued to stewards on Hawthorn&#x27;s behalf. The points granted Hawthorn were the difference in the championship. This season also saw a woman driving in Formula One for the first time with Maria Teresa de Filippis racing a private Maserati at the Belgian Grand Prix.

1958 was a watershed in another crucial way for Formula One. Against a small field of Ferraris and Maseratis, Stirling Moss won the Argentine Grand Prix driving a mid-engined Cooper entered by the private team of Rob Walker, and powered by a 2-litre Coventry-Climax Straight-4. This was the first victory for a car with the engine mounted behind the driver in Formula One. It was also the first World Championship GP win for a private entrant (excepting the Indianapolis 500 where all the entries were technically private entrants using bought-in chassis) as well as the first win for a car powered by an engine built by another manufacturer. The next Grand Prix in Monaco was also won by the same Cooper car, this time driven by Maurice Trintignant and facing more substantial opposition. Powered by undersized engines, the Coopers remained outsiders in 1958 but as soon as the new 2.5-litre Coventry-Climax engine was available, the little British cars went on to dominate Formula One. The 1959 season was effectively the start of the mid-engined revolution, and this season saw fierce competition between the works Cooper of Australian Jack Brabham and Moss in the Walker team&#x27;s Cooper. The Getrag-modified Citroën Traction Avant transaxle proved to be the Achilles heel of the Coopers, so Walker switched to a transaxle manufactured by ex-Maserati engineer Valerio Colotti. The special transmission turned out to be more unreliable than the standard part, and Brabham took the title with Moss second.

For 1960 while Enzo Ferrari adopted a conservative attitude, claiming &quot;the horses pull the car rather than push it.&quot; It was probably disinformation: at the same time Ferrari was preparing for 1961 by designing mid-engined F2 and F1 cars. The Italian front-engined red cars were not only being effectively beaten by the British teams but thoroughly outclassed- the British rear mid-engined cars had considerably better road holding than the front-engined cars. Although down on power, the British cars&#x27; superior handling and lesser demands on tyres more than made up the power deficit. It was obvious to everyone that rear-mid engined cars were the way to go at that point in time. Lotus and BRM introduced mid-engined machines. Walker&#x27;s team switched to a Lotus 18 chassis. Moss gave Lotus its first Formula One victory at Monaco but his season was ruined by a serious crash at Spa, Belgium. Brabham took a second title with his Cooper, but Moss returned in time to win the final race of the season, the U.S. Grand Prix at Riverside, California.

The mid-engined revolution rendered another potentially revolutionary car obsolete. The front-engined four-wheel drive Ferguson P99 raced in British Formula One races in , winning the non-Championship Oulton Park International Gold Cup under heavy rain. The car was too heavy and complex compared to the new breed of mid-engined machines. By 1961, British specialist teams such as Lotus, Cooper and BRM, and later McLaren, Tyrrell and Williams- organizations created purely for producing, developing and competing purpose-built open-wheel racing cars had overtaken the industrial manufacturing powers such as Ferrari, Mercedes, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. The only major automotive manufacturer with a full works effort was Ferrari- which was really a manufacturer that made road cars to fund its racing in F1 and endurance racing. Whereas the big continental manufacturers, with much money to spend, built the whole car including the drivetrain systems themselves, (excluding BRM), the British teams, with only limited amounts of money only built their chassis; they bought their engines and gearboxes from independent manufacturers such as Coventry-Climax and later Ford/Cosworth engines, and Hewland gearboxes. The only British team that was also a manufacturer of road cars like Ferrari was Lotus; but even so, that company grew considerably but never to the size of Mercedes or Alfa Romeo. From 1957 to 1961, Formula One had transformed from a scattershot industrial manufacturer sideshow of technology to a seriously competitive business for team owners and engineers wanting to come up with new technologies to out-do the opposition and also to sell their technology to big manufacturers or other interested parties. People like Cooper and Lotus founders John Cooper and Colin Chapman proved that competitiveness and developing new automotive technology was about fresh thinking, not industrial might. These British teams were regularly beating manufacturer teams like Ferrari, whom company founder Enzo Ferrari referring to these new British teams as &quot;garagistes&quot; – Italian for garage teams, which is effectively how all these British teams operated – their cars were built in small sheds or garages.

In , in an attempt to curb speeds, Formula One was downgraded to 1.5-litre, non-supercharged engines (essentially the then-current Formula Two rules), a formula which would remain for the next five years. Forced induction was still an option, but limited to 750 cc, and no one seriously considered the option, as supercharging had proven limiting to fuel consumption. Ferrari could have used its already proven V6 powered mid-engined Formula 2 cars, but preferred to go one step forward by designing a very sophisticated car powered by a 120° V6, which was their first ever rear-mid engined car, the 156. The considerably more powerful and efficient engine Ferrari had led to the Maranello outfit dominating the 1961 season as the British teams scrambled to come up with a suitable engine. American Phil Hill won the 1961 title in a works Ferrari. His teammate, Wolfgang von Trips of Germany, died along with 14 spectators in a horrific crash on the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Formula One World Championship was merely the tip of the iceberg when it came to races run to Formula One regulations. The total number of races run to Formula One regulations remained about the same as it had been before the introduction of the World Championship. Many famous races, such as the Pau and Syracuse Grands Prix, the BRDC International Trophy, the Race of Champions and the Oulton Park Gold Cup, were not part of the World Championship, but nonetheless continued to draw the top drivers and teams to compete.

=== Anglophone drivers and 1.5-litre engines (1962–1967) ===
:&quot;See 1962 season, 1963 season, 1964 season, 1965 season, 1966 season and 1967 season.&quot;

In 1962, the Lotus team ran the Lotus 25 powered by the new Coventry-Climax FWMV V8 engine. The car had an aluminium sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional spaceframe design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars, but the Lotus was unreliable at first. Jim Clark finished second that year leaving the title to Graham Hill and his new V8 powered BRM.

As soon as the car and the engine became reliable, the era of the Lotus and of Jim Clark began. Clark won the title twice in three years, and , the latter being the only occasion to date of a driver winning both the Championship and the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race in the same year. For 1964 Lotus introduced the new Lotus 33 and Ferrari made considerable technological and financial effort to win the title. Ferrari used no less than three different engines in the seasonthe existing V6, a V8 and a flat-12, while Lotus was struggling with the teething troubles of a new car. The title went to John Surtees and Ferrari. Surtees&#x27; title was especially notable, as he became the only driver ever to win the World Championship for both cars and motorcycles. The 1965 Mexican Grand Prix, the last race of the 1.5 litres Formula One, saw Richie Ginther give Honda its first victory at the end of the second season for the Japanese newcomer. This was the first victory by a Japanese car and, as of today, the only one by a car powered by a transverse engine.

 saw a &#x27;Return to Power&#x27; as Formula One changed the engine rules once again, allowing engines of 3.0-litre normally aspirated, or 1.5-litre supercharged or forced induction. 1966 was a transitional year for most teams, however, the year did see the first use of composite materials, a technology which would later revolutionise the sport. The McLaren M2B, designed by Robin Herd, used an aluminium-wood laminate known as Mallite for much of its monocoque, although the car&#x27;s design did not make best use of the new material. Given the shift to 1500 cc forced induction, it is surprising that any teams did not seriously consider fielding turbocharged versions of their 1500 cc naturally aspirated engines right from that point, Coventry Climax had considered it for their FWMW flat 16, but the company had decided to end its Formula 1 racing activities and the idea stopped there. It would be eleven years before a team exploited the 1500 cc forced induction option again.

Ferrari was the great favorite with a 3-litre version of his well tested powerful sports car V12 design, but the new cars were very heavy, probably in an excess of self-confidence. An enlarged V6 held some promise but Surtees left mid-season after a dispute with team manager Eugenio Dragoni at the 24 Hours of Le Mans sportscar race. Coventry-Climax, formerly supplier to much of the field, pulled out of the sport leaving teams like Lotus to struggle with enlarged versions of obsolete Climax engines. Cooper turned to a development of an otherwise obsolete Maserati V12 that was originally designed for the Maserati 250 F in the late 1950s, while BRM made the choice to design an incredibly heavy and complex H-16. The big winner was Jack Brabham, whose eponymous racing team took victory two years running with a light and compact spaceframe chassis powered by the aluminium-block stock-derived Repco V8 unit. With SOHC heads and no more than 330 bhp, the Repco was one of the least powerful of the new 3-litre engines but unlike the others it was light, reliable and available right from the start of the new rules. 1966 was Jack&#x27;s year, while went to his teammate, New Zealander Denny Hulme, as Jack tried new parts on his car.

In 1967, Lotus introduced the Lotus 49, powered by the Ford-Cosworth DFV V-8 engine that was to dominate Formula One for the next decade. Like the Repco the Cosworth was light and compact but it was a real racing engine using 4-valve DOHC heads and delivered much more power. Cosworth had aimed for and exceeded this when the engine first ran. The DFV was designed to be fully stressed (an idea pioneered by the Lancia D50). This allowed Chapman to design a monocoque that ended just after the driver&#x27;s seat while the Brabham were still using a very classic tubular frame that supported the engine, the gearbox, and the rear suspension wishbones. The newborn DFV suffered from frequent failures due to excessive vibration from the flat-plane crank, forcing Keith Duckworth to redesign several parts and allowing Hulme to win the World Drivers&#x27; Crown on reliability.

1967 also saw a remarkable result by Rhodesian driver John Love with a 2.7-litre four-cylinder Cooper-Climax. Love, who was in his forties and although seen as one of the finest drivers in Southern Africa was not a major star, led and finished second in that year&#x27;s South African Grand Prix. Love&#x27;s obsolete Cooper was originally designed for the short races of the Tasman Series; to run a full Grand Prix, Love added two auxiliary fuel tanks. Unfortunately, the auxiliary tank&#x27;s fuel pump failed and forced him to refuel after having led most of the race.

By the late 1960s, overseas races outside Europe formed about a third of the championship in any year. The core of the season remained the European season run over the Northern Hemisphere summer, with overseas races usually falling at the start or end of the season, a pattern which has continued to this day. There were also a number of non-championship races run outside Europe; the South African Grand Prix was occasionally one of these. British and English-native speaking drivers dominated the racing scene in the 1960s. Britons Graham Hill, Jim Clark, John Surtees and Jackie Stewart won 7 championships combined in that decade- Australian Jack Brabham won 2 championships, New Zealander Denny Hulme won a championship in 1967 and American Phil Hill won a championship in 1961.

=== DFV engine, 12-cylinder engines, and the arrival of sponsorship, safety, and aerodynamics (1968–1976) ===

:&quot;See 1968 season, 1969 season, 1970 season, 1971 season, 1972 season, 1973 season, 1974 season, 1975 season and 1976 season.&quot;

In 1968, Lotus lost its exclusive right to use the DFV. McLaren built a DFV-powered car and a new force appeared on the scene when Ken Tyrrell entered his team using Cosworth-powered French Matra chassis driven by ex-BRM Jackie Stewart as lead driver. Clark took his last win at the 1968 season opening South African Grand Prix. On 7 April 1968, the double champion was killed at Hockenheim in a Formula Two event.

The season saw three significant innovations. The first was the arrival of unrestricted sponsorship, which the FIA decided to permit that year after the withdrawal of support from automobile related firms like BP, Shell and Firestone. Team Gunston, a South African privateer team, was the first Formula One team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors when they entered a private Brabham for John Love, painted in the colours of Gunston cigarettes, in the 1968 South African Grand Prix. In the next round at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix, Team Lotus, initially using the British racing green, became the first works team to follow this example, with Graham Hill&#x27;s Lotus 49B entered in the Red, Gold and White colors of the Imperial Tobacco&#x27;s Gold Leaf brand.

The second innovation was the introduction of wings as seen previously on various cars including the Chaparral 2F sports car. Colin Chapman introduced modest front wings and a spoiler on Graham Hill&#x27;s Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. Brabham and Ferrari went one better at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix with full width wings mounted on struts high above the driver. Lotus replied with a full width wing directly connected to the rear suspension that required a redesign of suspension wishbones and transmission shafts. Matra then produced a high mounted front wing connected to the front suspension. This last innovation was mostly used during practice as it required a lot of effort from the driver. By the end of the season, most teams were using sophisticated wings. There were several cases of wings, struts, or even suspension collapsing.

Lastly, the third innovation was the introduction of a full face helmet for drivers, with Dan Gurney becoming the first driver to wear such helmet at the 1968 German Grand Prix. Lotus won both titles in with Graham Hill with Stewart second.

1968 was the year that former double World Champion Jim Clark died in a Formula 2 race in Germany. This was a tragedy for the sport and many of its fans and within the next few years, many of the drivers campaigned for more safety at races to stop more deaths from happening. The 1968 Matra&#x27;s most innovative feature was the use of aviation-inspired structural fuel tanks but the FIA decided to ban the technology for 1970. For 1969 Matra made the radical decision to withdraw its works team and build a new car using structural tanks for the Tyrrell team, even though it would be eligible for only a single season. The 1969 season started with cars using larger and more sophisticated wings than the previous year. When both Lotus cars broke their wings&#x27; struts and crashed at the Spanish Grand Prix, the FIA banned wings for the next race at Monaco. They were reintroduced later in the season but were to be restricted in size and height and attached directly to the chassis in a fixed position.

Safety became a major issue in Formula One and the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa did not take place as the drivers boycotted the circuit after safety upgrades were not installed as demanded. Stewart won the 1969 title easily with the new Matra MS80, a spectacular achievement from a constructor and a team that had only entered Formula One the previous year. It remains the only title won by a chassis built in France. 1969 also saw a brief resurgence of interest in four-wheel drive with a record of four such cars on the field at the British Grand Prix. Johnny Servoz-Gavin became the one and the only driver to score a point with a 4WD, finishing sixth with the Matra MS84 at the Canadian Grand Prix, although the front wheel transmission was actually disconnected. Wide tyres and downforce had proved to be better means of increasing grip, and the technology was largely abandoned. Jacky Ickx finished second in the championship for Brabham, competitive again after dropping its Repco engines in favour of the DFV.

For 1970 Tyrrell was asked by Matra to use their V12, but decided to retain the Cosworth instead. As Matra was now a Chrysler affiliate and Tyrrell derived much of its income from Ford and Elf (associated with Renault) the partnership ended. Ken Tyrrell bought March 701 chassis as an interim solution while developing his own car for the next season. The new wedge-shaped Lotus 72 was a very innovative car featuring variable flexibility torsion bar suspension, hip-mounted radiators, inboard front brakes, and an overhanging rear wing. The 72 originally had suspension problems, but once resolved the car quickly showed its superiority, and Lotus&#x27;s new leader, the Austrian Jochen Rindt, dominated the championship until he was killed at Monza when a brake shaft broke. He took the title posthumously for Lotus. 1970 saw the introduction of slick tyres by Goodyear. Ferrari&#x27;s new flat-12 engine proved to be more powerful than the Ford-Cosworth DFV; but slightly heavier. Their performance started to improve at the end of that season, and Belgian Jacky Ickx won 3 races- but this proved to not be enough to overhaul Rindt&#x27;s points total; Ickx later said he was happy to not have won the championship that year.

After Rindt&#x27;s death, the Lotus team had a desultory 1971 season with its two new and inexperienced driversEmerson Fittipaldi and Reine Wisell. The team spent a lot of time experimenting with a gas turbine powered car, and with four-wheel drive again. After Jack Brabham&#x27;s retirement, his old team went into a steep decline. Using their own chassis heavily inspired by the Matra MS80 but with conventional tanks, Tyrrell and Stewart easily took success in . Focusing again on the type 72 chassis, now fielded in John Player Special&#x27;s black and gold livery, Lotus took the championship by surprise with 25-year-old Brazilian driver Emerson Fittipaldi becoming the then youngest world champion. Stewart came second, his performance compromised by a stomach ulcer.

In , Lotus teammates Fittipaldi and Ronnie Peterson raced each other while Stewart was supported by François Cevert at Tyrrell. Stewart took the Drivers&#x27; title, but then at the final race of the season, the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Cevert crashed during Saturday practice in the notorious esses and was killed instantly. Stewart, temporary hire Chris Amon, and Tyrrell withdrew from the race effectively handing the Constructors&#x27; title to Lotus. At the end of the season, Stewart made public his decision to retire, a decision that was already made before the U.S. Grand Prix.

McLaren, having fully recovered from the death of its founder, ended the 1973 season with three wins and several poles. The new M23, an updated interpretation of the Lotus 72 concept, appeared to many as the best design on the field. Fittipaldi made the choice to leave Lotus for McLaren that offered him true lead driver status that Chapman refused to him.

The 1974 season went to pre-season favourites McLaren and Fittipaldi but was a far closer result than expected. Ferrari bounced back from a dismal 1973 season with its first true monocoque cars, the flat-12 powered 312 B3s driven by young Austrian Niki Lauda and the experienced Clay Regazzoni. Despite the failure of the new Lotus 76, Peterson managed to win Grands Prix with the four-year-old 72. Brabham driver Carlos Reutemann was also able to win with the new BT44 and young talent Jody Scheckter ended most of the races in the points, including winning the Swedish Grand Prix with the M23-lookalike Tyrrell 007. Lauda&#x27;s season fizzled out after a crash on the first lap of the German Grand Prix. Only the last race of the season decided the Drivers&#x27; title between Fittipaldi, Regazzoni, and Scheckter.

By this time the innovations introduced by the Lotus 49 and 72 had changed car design. Fully stressed engine and variable flexibility suspension was now the norm, most cars had wedge shaped bodywork and airboxes towered over driver&#x27;s heads. The main innovation of this era came in 1975, when the Ferrari 312T appeared, its transverse gearbox allowing better weight distribution.

Ferrari won the Constructors titles in , , and . Lauda took a relatively straightforward first Drivers&#x27; title in 1975. The main surprise of the season came when the tiny Hesketh team won the Dutch Grand Prix with James Hunt. Despite entering only one car and refusing sponsorship the team finished 4th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. That year also saw Lella Lombardi score the first points by a woman in Formula One for 6th place at the Spanish Grand Prix.
For 1976, Fittipaldi made the surprising decision to drive for the Brazilian Fittipaldi Automotive team of his brother Wilson, sponsored by Copersucar. James Hunt, who knew that Hesketh&#x27;s future was doomed by its lack of sponsorship (Lord Hesketh had tried to obtain major backing once he realised Hunt was a likely title contender and that he could no longer afford to run the team out of his own pocket), signed for McLaren. In 1976 Lauda&#x27;s second successive title seemed inevitable until he crashed on the second lap at the Nürburgring, suffering severe burns as well as lung and blood damage. He was given the last rites but unbelievably was back in his Ferrari six weeks later. He lost the championship by a single point to James Hunt in heavy rain at the final round at Fuji in Japan when he pitted his car and refused to continue, declaring that the risk was too great and that from now on he would refuse to race under extreme conditions.

The most radical innovation of 1976 was the 6-wheeled Tyrrell P34. The P34 was a good car, often finishing third or fourth and winning the Swedish Grand Prix, but it was not superior to the best 4-wheeled cars. 1976 also saw the Lotus team fitting brushes or plastic skirts under its rather uncompetitive 77; McLaren and Brabham also experimented with air-dams and splitters in an attempt to cause low-pressure areas under the car but found no significant effect on performance, in fact, nobody knew what was in Chapman&#x27;s mind.

The incident at Fuji damaged Lauda&#x27;s relationship with Enzo Ferrari and Lauda officially became the second driver of the Scuderia with Carlos Reutemann as the leader. Lauda signed for Brabham before the end of the 1977 championship, having taken the title easily before Enzo Ferrari refused him a car for the end of the season. His second title was mostly built on regularity and reliability. Despite his conflict with the &quot;Commendatore&quot; and his second driver status Lauda enjoyed immense respect from the Ferrari team, which did its best to give him a good car. There was in fact a very competitive field that year but no single challenger to the Austrian emerged and points taken away from Ferrari were shared between many teams and drivers. Surprisingly, the new Wolf team, born from the ashes of Frank Williams Racing Cars and Hesketh, made excellent use of its legacy with Jody Scheckter finishing second to Niki Lauda.

=== Ground-effect era (1977–1982) ===
:&quot;See 1977 season, 1978 season, 1979 season, 1980 season, 1981 season and 1982 season.&quot;
1977 also saw two radical technical innovations that would change the future of Formula One. The purpose of Lotus&#x27;s experimentation in 1976 was revealed with the Lotus 78, which brought ground effect to Formula One for the first time, using wing-profiled sidepods sealed to the ground by sliding lexan skirts. Generating radically increased downforce with significantly less drag, the Lotus 78s driven by Mario Andretti and Gunnar Nilsson won five Grands Prix in 1977. Renault unveiled the second when their RS01 made its first appearance powered by a 1.5-litre turbocharged engine, derived from their sportscar unit. Although supercharged engines were successful in the 1950s and the regulations allowing for turbocharged engines had existed for 11 years, no Formula One team had built one, feeling that the fuel consumption and turbo lag (boost lag) would negate its superior power. Motor engineer Bernard Dudot, who had observed the turbocharged Offenhauser engines used in Indy car racing in the US, pushed for this choice.

The entry of Renault also brought Michelin&#x27;s radial tyres to Formula One. Goodyear, who enjoyed a monopoly before the entry of Michelin, was still using the cross ply design for racing. Goodyear saw the entry of Michelin as a serious threat and made a notable effort in research and development to develop its own radial tyres. Tyrrell&#x27;s 1977 season was disastrous because Goodyear was too busy to continue to develop the unique small tyres required by the P34. Without continuing development, the tyres became less competitive and the six-wheeled concept had to be dropped. Michelin eventually left F1 after the 1984 season.
For the new Lotus 79 made more radical and mature use of the ground effect concept. Many other teams began experimenting with the technology, but Lotus had a head start and Mario Andretti won the Championship in the &quot;Black Beauty&quot;, becoming the first driver to win both the American IndyCar championship and the Formula One title. Brabham outbid Lotus in generating downforce with BT46B &quot;fan car&quot;, a revival of the &quot;sucker car&quot; concept used by Jim Hall&#x27;s Chaparral 2J in the Can-Am series in the early 1970s. The car exploited a loophole in the regulations, but the team, led by Bernie Ecclestone who had recently become president of the Formula One Constructors Association, withdrew the car before it had a chance to be banned after winning its only race with Niki Lauda at the wheel at the Swedish Grand Prix. Late in the season, Ronnie Peterson crashed into the barriers in the first lap at Monza and his Lotus burst into flames. James Hunt heroically pulled him out of the car and the medical prognosis was initially good but the Swede died the next day because of an embolism. Hunt would retire after the following season&#x27;s Monaco Grand Prix.

For 1979 Ligier, the up-and-coming Williams team and surprisingly Ferrari, despite the handicap of the Flat-12 that obstructed wind tunnels, produced wing-cars designs that were more effective than the Lotus 79. This forced Lotus to hastily introduce the new 80 that overplayed the ground effect concept (it was originally intended to run with no drag-inducing wings, merely ground-effect sidepods) and never proved competitive. Renault persisted with the turbo engine, despite frequent breakdowns that resulted in the nickname of the &#x27;Little Yellow Teapot&#x27;, and finally won for the first time at Dijon in with the RS10 that featured both ground effect and turbo engine.
The new technologies introduced by Renault and Lotus became entangled in the FISA–FOCA war of the early 1980s. Turbo engines were complex machines whose layout limited the ground effect &#x27;tunnels&#x27; under the car. They were an emerging technology and so they were difficult and expensive to develop and build and make reliable. It was mostly manufacturer-supported teams, such as Renault, Ferrari, and Alfa Romeo which took that route. In contrast, the cheap, reliable, and narrow Ford-Cosworth DFV engine, still used by most teams more than a decade after its introduction, lent itself well to highly efficient ground effect aerodynamics. These two groups were represented by two political bodiesthe sport&#x27;s governing body FISA, headed by Jean-Marie Balestre; and FOCA, headed up by Bernie Ecclestone. The first group supported a strict limitation of ground effect to gain full advantage from their powerful turbos while the other relied on unrestricted ground effect to balance their horsepower deficit. There were also financial considerations. Faced with large constructors with unrestricted budgets, the smaller constructors wanted a larger share of Formula One&#x27;s income to remain competitive.

The battles between FISA and FOCA during the first years of the 1980s overshadowed the events on track. Jody Scheckter took Ferrari&#x27;s last title for 21 years in , but attention there was already being focused on young Canadian Gilles Villeneuve. Alan Jones and Keke Rosberg brought success to Frank Williams at last in and , while young Brazilian Nelson Piquet won titles for Brabham team owner Ecclestone in and .

Patrick Depailler was killed in , probably due to high lateral acceleration causing a black out in Hockenheim&#x27;s fast Ostkurve. The double blow struck to Ferrari in , of the death of Gilles Villeneuve and the crippling injury to teammate Didier Pironi only a few weeks later, helped bring this crisis into the spotlight, and helped both sides settle the dispute for the good of the sport.

The old fashioned DFV helped make the UK domestic Aurora Formula One series possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a generation before, second hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series. In 1980 the series saw South African Desiré Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Williams in a non-championship event.

After several years in darkness McLaren merged with Ron Dennis&#x27;s Formula Two Project-4 team. The McLaren MP4/1 (McLaren Project-4) introduced the first carbon fiber composite chassis in 1981, an innovation which, despite initial doubts over its likely performance in a crash, had been taken up by all the teams by the middle of the decade. The use of carbon fibre composite in place of aluminium honeycomb produced cars that were significantly lighter, yet also far stiffer which improved grip and therefore cornering speed. Significant skepticism regarding the use of carbon fiber chassis remained, but John Watson&#x27;s 1981 crash in the MP4/1 showed that the new technology was sufficiently safe, with the violent accident leaving Watson unscathed, where similar previous incidents had resulted in death or serious injury.
=== 1.5-litre turbo-charged engines (1983–1988) ===
:&quot;See 1983 season, 1984 season, 1985 season, 1986 season, 1987 season and 1988 season.&quot;
The drivers&#x27; title, won by Piquet for the BMW-powered Brabham team of Bernie Ecclestone, was the first-ever won by a turbocharged engine. By 1983, the dispute between FISA and FOCA had been resolved and although FOCA emerged with the stronger hand, the teams had seen the writing on the wall. Renault had proven in 1979 and 1980 that turbo-charged engines were a more efficient means of getting more performance from the powertrain with the FIA regulations. The turbo cars were faster on almost all of the high speed (Hockenheim, Österreichring, Monza, Silverstone) and high-altitude tracks (Interlagos, Kyalami), but by 1982, the turbo cars were fastest just about everywhere. The 1982 season made it obvious to all the competing Formula One teams that turbocharged engines were the way to go if anyone wanted to be competitive in Formula 1. By 1983, the reliability of the turbo-charged engines had been ironed out and made more reliable, and in 1984, only Tyrrell still struggled on with the old DFV engines. 1983 also saw the last non-championship Formula One race: The 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Ford/Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.

After nearly 50 years the power achieved by the turbocharged cars could finally match the 640 hp (477 kW) produced by the supercharged 1937 Mercedes-Benz W125, without a huge consumption of special fuel. By , some engines were producing over in short bursts in qualifying. BMW&#x27;s dynamometer was incapable of measuring the output of their qualifying enginesPaul Rosche estimated that it might be as much as . First fuel consumption and then turbocharger boost were restricted to 4-bar in 1987 and 1.5-bar in 1988. By 1988, the turbos were only slightly more powerful than the lighter 3.5-litre naturally aspirated cars that had been introduced the previous year. The thirsty turbo engines briefly saw refuelling introduced into the sport, but this was banned for 1984.
With controversy at last left behind, the Formula One teams flourished through the remainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s. Despite the overwhelming dominance of some teams during some seasons, this period is regarded (perhaps ironically) as one of the brightest spots in F1&#x27;s 50-year history. Niki Lauda, coming out of retirement for a hefty sum in , pipped his teammate Alain Prost to the title in by a mere half-point, the closest ever finish in Formula One history. That half-point in itself was controversial in that it came at the rain-shortened Grand Prix of Monaco, which resulted in half points, Prost won the race, but Ayrton Senna made the stronger impression in his Toleman car by finishing 2nd and rapidly closing on Prost, It was the start of a rivalry between the two men that would continue for nearly a decade. But in the early years, Prost held the advantage, driving for the McLaren team with the Porsche-built TAG turbo engine which took three world titles in a row.

 provided another close finish. The Honda-powered Williams cars of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell looked untouchable, but too often they took points from each other, allowing McLaren&#x27;s Prost to stay in touch. Although Williams easily won the Constructors&#x27; Championship that year, it was not until the season-ending Grand Prix of Australia that the Drivers&#x27; title was decided, Prost making the most of both Williams drivers tyre problems. saw the Williams grow only stronger, with Piquet driving more consistent races to take his 3rd title ahead of Mansell who crashed in Japan in practice forcing him to sit out for the final 2 races.

1987 also saw the return of atmospheric engines to Formula One, after the turbo-only year of 1986. Capacity was increased to 3.5 litres, and the turbo engines were restricted in boost pressure and fuel capacity to limit their effect, with a total ban to be introduced in . Nevertheless, while turbo engines lasted, they dominated, with Williams-Honda winning easily in 1987, and then Honda teaming up with McLaren in that resulted in the super-team of Prost and Senna winning 15 of 16 races, a record beaten only by Red Bull Racing in 2023. It was Senna who emerged the victor, claiming the first of his three World Titles.

:&quot;See 1989 season, 1990 season, 1991 season, 1992 season and 1993 season.&quot;
In 1989, turbos were banned and new regulations allowing only naturally aspirated engines up to 3.5 litres were put in their place. The dominance of McLaren-Honda continued for the next 3 seasons, Prost winning the title in 1989, Senna in and . The V10 and V12 engines produced by the Japanese manufacturer proved to be just as good as the turbo V6s before them, and the V10 was the best engine over the two seasons it was used and developed by Honda. The championship was marred however by the fierce rivalry between the two men, culminating in a pair of clashes at the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990. They both dominated Formula One from 1988 to 1990, winning 37 of the 48 Grand Prix staged and each scoring almost twice as many points as the third-place driver in those championships. In 1989 Prost &#x27;closed the door&#x27; on his overtaking teammate while Senna later freely admitted to deliberately driving into Prost in the 1990 race, drawing stiff condemnation from all quarters of Formula One. Senna, however, was more concerned with the threat (and opportunity) afforded by the resurgent Williams, now powered by Renault (the French giant&#x27;s innovative engine technology resulted in major progress) and designed by aerodynamics genius Adrian Newey which were to dominate Formula One for the next 7 years.

In the early 1990s, teams started introducing electronic driver aids, whose use spread rapidly. Active suspension, (pioneered by Lotus in 1987), semi-automatic gearboxes (Ferrari in 1989), and traction control (Ferrari in 1990) All enabled cars to reach higher and higher speeds provided the teams were willing to spend the money. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids in 1994. However, many observers felt that the ban on driver aids was a ban in name only as the FIA did not have the technology or the methods to eliminate these features from the competition. Even this controversy did not diminish the pleasure British fans of the sport felt in 1992, when Nigel Mansell finally won the title, after a decade of trying, nor French fans in when Alain Prost took his 4th Championship, both drivers piloting Williams-Renault cars.

Lightweight television cameras attached to the cars became common in the early 1990s (following an American network TV practise actually pioneered in Australia). As well as boosting audience figures this also made the sport more attractive to sponsors beyond the traditional cigarette companies. Safety improvements also meant that the major car manufacturers were more inclined to attach themselves to teams on a rolling basis. then seemed ripe to produce a stunning season. Ayrton Senna had moved to Williams to replace Prost, who retired from the sport. Young German driver Michael Schumacher had Ford power for his Benetton. McLaren had high hopes for its new Peugeot engine (which had been developed through the French marque&#x27;s Le Mans sportscar racing program) which ultimately did not happen and Ferrari were looking to put the tumultuous seasons of 1991–93 behind them with Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi. The season was stunning but for all the wrong reasons.

=== Safety, rules, and regulations (1994) ===
:&quot;See 1994 season.&quot;

By , the previous death in Formula One was nearly a decade past, that of Elio de Angelis during testing at the Circuit Paul Ricard in 1986. There had been several horrifying accidents (for example Nelson Piquet and Gerhard Berger at Imola, or Martin Donnelly at Jerez), but no fatalities. The speed of Formula One cars had continuously risen over 8 years, despite turbocharged engines being made illegal, the width of tyres being reduced and driver aids eventually being removed. There was an &quot;air of invincibility&quot; in Formula One, a belief that the cars were inherently safe and no more drivers would die.

At the San Marino Grand Prix weekend this belief was crushed completely with the serious injuries sustained by Rubens Barrichello in practice and the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger during qualifying and Ayrton Senna in the race on 1 May 1994. Furthermore, Karl Wendlinger was left comatose after a crash two weeks later at the Monaco Grand Prix. The shock from the sudden injuries and deaths was stunning. Not only had two drivers been killed, but one of them was a triple world champion and arguably the best F1 driver at the time. The FIA reacted swiftly and harshly with major changes to be enforced from that year onwards, and it was the beginning of the FIA&#x27;s push to increase safety in Formula One.

While significant changes could not be made to cars in 1994, the FIA required all Formula One cars&#x27; airboxes to be perforated to reduce their &quot;ram-air&quot; effect, to reduce power. For the same reason special racing fuels, previously an exotic mixture of benzenes and toluenes, were banned and only those with similar characteristics to everyday unleaded petrol would be permitted. To reduce downforce, and therefore the cornering speed of the cars, a wooden &quot;plank&quot; was to be fitted beneath the central portion of the chassis, forcing a large section of the floor further away from the track. If the plank was worn over a certain tolerance (approximately 10 mm), the car would be deemed illegal. This wooden plank remains under F1 cars today.

Further, from 1995 designs were required to be drawn from a reference plane (template), and strict limitations were enforced as to the minimum and maximum tolerances for aspects of the vehicle such as the size of the cockpit opening (an idea well known in Champ Car for a decade) and of aerodynamic devices, commonly called wings. Further, maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.5 to 3 litres. Further changes were mandated as the FIA continued to try to curb the increase in speeds of Formula One cars as the years progressed. These changes included the increase in the size of the cockpit opening (to ensure driver egress was easy and to minimise possible side head impacts), introducing grooved tyres (to reduce cornering speeds by reducing grip) and narrower bodywork (this would complicate cooling and also reduce cornering speed), raising and reducing wing sizes and elements (cutting aerodynamic downforce, thus reducing cornering speed), and introducing comprehensive checks on stiffness tolerances and measurements to ensure cars conformed completely with the regulations (for example, weight tests on wings and bodywork to ensure that they maintained integrity and did not flex to give an aerodynamic advantage in a straight line).

The rapid introduction of all of these new rules and regulations, particularly those introduced in , made the atmosphere even more chaotic for Formula One. Michael Schumacher had to fight desperately for his first World Drivers&#x27; Championship, as his Benetton team found itself in frequent violations of FIA regulations and Schumacher was suspended for two races as a result. Even his championship-clinching race in Australia was controversial, as he collided with rival Damon Hill (son of Graham) and ensured himself of the title.

=== 3-litre engines (1995–1999) ===
:&quot;See 1995 season, 1996 season, 1997 season, 1998 season and 1999 season.&quot;

By , things had settled down somewhat. The downgraded 3-litre formula had no effect of the domination of the Renault V10, and Schumacher took his second Drivers&#x27; title, and Benetton their first Constructors&#x27; title, with relative ease, defeating the Williams team of Hill and David Coulthard. The Renault engine which powered both teams was virtually unbeatable, with only Ferrari claiming a single win at the Canadian Grand Prix for Alesi, his only career win.

For , the FIA mandated a much larger minimum size cockpit area, along with driver&#x27;s head protection, to ensure the driver&#x27;s head was less exposed (ironically, this limited driver visibility and contributed to accidents). As part of his plan to rebuild Ferrari, Jean Todt brought Michael Schumacher to the team from Benetton that year, essentially in exchange for his 1995 drivers Alesi and Berger. There was an immediate effect, in his first year with the Scuderia Schumacher won three races, more than the team had managed in the previous five years. Ferrari were not championship contenders though and Damon Hill made a strong run to the title, finally claiming the crown after 3 years of almost but not quite.

In , another son of an F1 racing legend took the titles for Williams once again, as Jacques Villeneuve became the 4th driver to take both the Formula One and CART championship (the others being Mario Andretti, Emerson Fittipaldi, and Nigel Mansell). Villeneuve also became the only Canadian to have won a Formula 1 Drivers&#x27; title. The 1997 season was much closer than 1996, and Villeneuve only clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship at the final race. Once again, Michael Schumacher collided with his championship rival at the final race, but unlike 1994 events turned against him. Schumacher not only found himself knocked out of the race, but was found to have deliberately tried to run Villeneuve off of the road. Schumacher was stripped of second place in the Championship and was disgraced.

At the end of 1997 Renault withdrew from Formula One. McLaren-Mercedes took the Drivers&#x27; Crown for the next two years, both being claimed by Mika Häkkinen. The Finn was nearly untouchable as he took his first title while Schumacher and Villeneuve could only watch. provided a stiffer contest for the title. Villeneuve was out of the picture at the brand-new BAR but Schumacher was in contention when he crashed and broke his leg at Silverstone. His teammate Eddie Irvine eventually lost by only two points to Mika Häkkinen, but his efforts contributed to Ferrari&#x27;s first Constructors&#x27; Championship since 1983.

Behind the title races, however, there were signs of trouble brewing in Formula One. The long-established, highly-respected Lotus name vanished from the starting grids, following Brabham&#x27;s demise in mid-1992. French manufacturer Ligier found themselves in desperate straits, and were sold to Alain Prost. Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s team floundered on, despite dismal results, until 1998, when BAR bought the team. And the colourful era of the small, private teams finally came to an end. Names like Larrousse, Dallara, Simtek, Pacific, MasterCard Lola, Life Racing Engines, March Engineering, Onyx Grand Prix, Coloni, Andrea Moda, Fondmetal, Osella, Footwork, AGS, Lambo, Leyton House Racing, EuroBrun and Forti would no longer be seen on the starting grids, with only Jordan, Sauber, Arrows and Minardi managing to survive somehow. The flourishing of Jordan in 1998 and 1999, under the leadership of Damon Hill, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher (Michael&#x27;s younger brother) proved to be a last hurrah of the privateer, not a sign of health in the sport. Even once-mighty Benetton champions only a few years before were barely surviving. Jackie Stewart fronted his own team from 1997 to 1999 with backing from Ford but even then sold out as the team transformed into Jaguar.

=== V10 engines and rise of road car manufacturer participation (2000–2005) ===
:&quot;See 2000 season, 2001 season, 2002 season, 2003 season, 2004 season and 2005 season.&quot;

After the banning of turbocharged engines in 1989, V10 became the most popular engine configuration in Formula One, because it offered the best compromise between power and fuel consumption. From the 1998 season onwards, all competing teams had V10 engines in their cars. V12s were powerful but thirsty, while V8s were more fuel-efficient but lacked power. saw the grids of Formula One start to revert to normal, as Jordan rapidly faded out of sight, and Williams, looking forward to a new partnership with BMW started to reassert itself. The fight at the front, however, was very much between Häkkinen and Schumacher, each two-time champion, driving cars closely matched in performance. Ferrari had been steadily improving since their low point in the early 1990s and in 2000 Schumacher prevailed, becoming the first three-time Champion since Senna, and bringing the World Drivers&#x27; title to Ferrari for the first time since Jody Scheckter in 1979. The season saw Ferrari start to leave the rest of the grid behind, and Schumacher won the championship by the Hungarian Grand Prix, which tied him as second quickest championship winner with Nigel Mansell. 2001 also saw the reintroduction of electronic driver aids after a seven-year absence, starting at the Spanish Grand Prix, which included fully-automatic gearboxes, launch control, and traction control, marking the first time since the season that these systems were allowed to be used. For , the season was a red-wash. Ferrari finished every race and won 15 of 17. Michael Schumacher scored more points than the second and third-placed drivers combined, after gaining a podium in all of the races (Schumacher had only a single third place, in Malaysia). In this season, he wrapped up the championship at the French Grand Prix (Round 11 of 17), becoming the earliest ever championship winner.

While Ferrari celebrated their dominance, the sport itself was seen by many to be in trouble. Two more privateers, Prost and Arrows, had closed their doors for good, while Benetton was bought out by Renault. Even more troubling was the one team in seemingly no danger of disappearing: Ferrari. While Formula One was no stranger to teams monopolizing the winner&#x27;s stand, Ferrari&#x27;s actions throughout the 2002 season annoyed many; in particular, the staged finishes of the Austrian Grand Prix and the US Grand Prix. It seemed to many that it was possible to take the dictum of &#x27;win at all costs&#x27; too far. Ratings and attendance noticeably declined in the latter half of 2002, a serious problem for a sport which was by far the most expensive (and, more importantly, most lucrative) in the world by this time.

A number of major car manufacturers had joined Formula One since 2000there were as many as eight manufacturers participating in Formula One at most. BMW and Honda had returned as works engine manufacturers in 2000, while Ford had rebranded the Stewart team as Jaguar and developed engines through its Cosworth subsidiary. In 2001, Renault also returned as a works engine maker and bought the Enstone-based Benetton team, which it rebranded as Renault in 2002. Toyota joined the series in 2002, developing both chassis and engine at its facility in Cologne. Mercedes continued its participation as engine manufacturer in association with Ilmor, and part-owned McLaren.

In 2003, despite heavy rule changes (such as a new points system) in order to prevent another year of Ferrari dominance, Schumacher won the championship once more. He was run close by both Kimi Räikkönen and Juan Pablo Montoya, but Schumacher prevailed, taking the championship by two points at Suzuka. It seemed that 2003 was the perfect balm to ease the memories of the previous season, with 8 different race winners (including first-time victories for Fernando Alonso, Kimi Räikkönen and Giancarlo Fisichella) and 5 different teams, including both Renault (for the first time in twenty years) and Jordan, who grabbed a lucky win in a wild Brazilian Grand Prix.

In 2004, Ferrari and Schumacher returned to almost total dominance of the championships, winning both with easein the first thirteen races of the season, Schumacher managed to win twelve. A new race in Bahrain made its debut in April and another new race in China debuted in September. It was initially thought that in introducing these new races, older Grands Prix in Europe, like the British Grand Prix, might be removed from the championship, but instead, the number of races was increased to eighteen. According to Ecclestone, the move was to increase Formula One&#x27;s global reach, though the steady tightening of restrictions on tobacco advertising in Europe and elsewhere may also have been a factor. This move saw the percentage of races held outside Formula One&#x27;s traditional European home climb to around fifty percentmeaning the World Championship, which visits four of the six continents, truly deserves its name. 2004 was Michael Schumacher&#x27;s most recent of his record seven World Championships. Schumacher also held the record for the most races wonwith ninety-one, and now remains the driver with the second most wins ever. The 2004 season also saw a big change in technical regulations, including the banning of two electronic driver aid systems; namely fully-automatic gearboxes and launch control, both of which had been used for the last three seasons, marking the first time since that cars competed without using these systems. This was done to ensure that costs were kept down for a competitive F1 team, as well as keeping the skill of driving a Formula 1 car relevant to the driver. However, the use of traction control was still permitted by the FIA, and was used for the next three seasons, until an effort to ban the system led to the FIA finally outlawing it for the season.

Despite Ferrari&#x27;s dominance (taking 15 wins from the 18 races), the battle back in the pack was much more open than 2002, as powerhouses McLaren and Williams got off to horrendous starts with radical new cars. As could have been expected, Renault was quick to capitalize on the misfortunes of the two older British teams, but the real shock came from British American Racing, led by Jenson Button. Although failing to win a race, Button was a regular sight on the 2nd or 3rd step of the podium, and with teammate Takuma Sato who had finished 3rd at the US Grand Prix behind the Ferraris managed to clinch 2nd in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, leaving Renault 3rd, Jarno Trulli&#x27;s win in Monaco some consolation. Montoya and Räikkönen each managed a solitary win for their teams, which finished 4th and 5th in the results. The Ford Motor Company&#x27;s decision to pull out of Formula One at the end of 2004 exposed the vulnerabilities of some small teams. Not only was their works Jaguar team sold to Austrian drinks company Red Bull, but the few remaining small independent teams, who traditionally had used Ford engines, found their engine supply in a precarious state.
In , Formula One saw Ferrari and BAR rapidly fade out of sight, as the works Renault team dominated the early part of the season, and Fernando Alonso forged a clear championship lead. In the latter part of the season, McLaren was significantly the stronger team, with consistently better results and a win tally of 6 from 7 races. However, their early record of poor reliability had meant that catching Renault in either Drivers&#x27; or Constructors&#x27; Championships was a tall order.

For a while, it looked close between Räikkönen and Alonso, but by Brazil Alonso had become Formula One&#x27;s youngest ever champion. The Constructors&#x27; Championship looked even more likely for McLaren, widely regarded as the faster car and with reliability much improved. However, a retirement for Juan Pablo Montoya in the season finale at Shanghai secured the Constructors&#x27; title for Renault. One statistic proved the two teams&#x27; dominance: they together won all but one of the races, the controversial U.S. Grand Prix, in which neither of the two teams participated, which was Schumacher and Ferrari&#x27;s only win of the year.

Arguably, the final small specialist racing team disappeared with the September 2005 purchase of Minardi by Red Bull to be renamed as Scuderia Toro Rosso and run as a separate entity alongside Red Bull Racing. Jordan had been bought by Russo-Canadian steel company Midland early in 2005 and was renamed Midland F1 for the 2006 season. In June 2005, BMW bought a majority stake in Sauber, which became their factory entry. The Williams team ceased their partnership with BMW as a result, entering a commercial arrangement with Cosworth instead. From 2006 manufacturer teams had an unprecedented level of involvement in the sport. Honda also bought BAR.

2005 marked the end of the V10-era in Formula One. To keep costs down, the configuration had been made mandatory in 2000 (although only V10s had been in use since 1998, Toyota were planning on entering Formula One with a V12 and had to delay their entry by a year to redesign) so that engine builders would not develop and experiment with other configurations. Over this period, the statistics show the supremacy of the Renault and Ferrari engines, with Renault clinching six Constructors and five Drivers&#x27; Championships as engine suppliers for Williams and Benetton from 1992 to 1997, and their first-ever Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships in a 100% Renault car in 2005. Ferrari also enjoyed great success in the V10 era, winning six Constructors&#x27; Championships and five Drivers&#x27; Championships from 1999 to 2004.

=== 2.4-litre V8 engines (2006–2008) ===
:&quot;See 2006 season, 2007 season and 2008 season.&quot;

2006 was the last season with two tyre manufacturers: Japanese manufacturer Bridgestone and French company Michelin. In December 2005, the FIA announced that from the 2008 season, there would be only one tyre-supplier. Five days later, Michelin announced it would quit Formula One at the end of the 2006 season, leaving Bridgestone as the sole supplier from 2007. Renault and Fernando Alonso established early leads in both the Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; Championships. By mid-season, Ferrari appeared to be making a comeback. The Italian Grand Prix saw Schumacher reduce Alonso&#x27;s lead to only two points as Alonso suffered an engine failure. The race also saw Ferrari pull ahead of Renault for the first time in 2006. The race results were largely overshadowed by Schumacher announcing, during the post-race press conference, that he would retire at the end of the season. An engine failure for Schumacher at the Japanese Grand Prix, along with costly puncture in the final round in Brazil allowed Alonso to secure the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the second year running, with Renault also securing the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

The 2007 Formula One season saw a much more competitive McLaren, with current world champion Alonso alongside rookie Lewis Hamilton. However, Hamilton surprised everyone with a run of nine consecutive podiums in his first nine races seeing him take a significant lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Alonso&#x27;s relationship with McLaren deteriorated as the season progressed, as he believed it was his right as world champion to be favoured above his teammate. A mistake by Hamilton in China and a mechanical problem in Brazil ruined his championship. Alonso, however, was not able to fully capitalise
on the situation, and Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen took the championship after a strong second half to the season. Räikkönen turned around a 17-point deficit with two races to go to win by a single point.

Both McLarens finished the Championship on 109 points. Fernando Alonso was placed third, behind Lewis Hamilton through countback. Renault had a much less successful season in 2007 than in previous years and struggled to match the pace of McLaren and Ferrari. Ferrari also clinched the Constructors&#x27; Championship after McLaren&#x27;s disqualification over the controversy over the suspicion that McLaren had Ferrari information. marked the seventh and final season, since its reintroduction in , that the use of traction control was permitted in F1. Standardised ECUs were mandated by the FIA from the 2008 season onwards, which prevented teams from using this kind of technology. The season also marked the first time since the 2001 San Marino Grand Prix that all cars competed without using traction control. For the 2008 and 2009 seasons Fernando Alonso returned to Renault, but having little success he joined Ferrari in 2010.

2008 again saw McLaren and Ferrari have the most competitive cars. However, the season was much more open, with winners from three other teams. After agonising defeat in 2007, Hamilton clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship in dramatic fashion, overtaking Timo Glock in the Toyota to secure the fifth place he needed in the last corner of the last lap of the final Grand Prix. Felipe Massa had won the race, and would also have won the Drivers&#x27; Championship if it had not been for Hamilton&#x27;s crucial overtake. Despite this, Ferrari secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the eighth time in ten years.

=== Cost-cutting measures and departure of car manufacturers (2009–2013) ===
:&quot;See 2009 season, 2010 season, 2011 season, 2012 season and 2013 season.&quot;

During the 2000s, Formula One cars had become extremely complex, efficient, and reliable, so much so that actual racing between drivers began to become less and less common. 2009 saw the introduction of many new rules and regulations (including engine RPM limits, an adjustable front wing, and disproportionate wing sizes) to encourage overtaking. Engine RPM reached 20,000 rpm (and over for Renault and Cosworth) in , and was initially limited to 19,000 rpm for 2007; this was lowered to 18,000 from 2009 to 2013.

The most significant system introduced in F1 was the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), a system that stores energy, created by braking, through a flywheel; this energy is then channeled to the car&#x27;s drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well-funded teams had tested this technology the previous year but it remained too experimental; all of the teams&#x27; KERS systems needed more development, so none of them would be ready for 2009. Due to the global economic recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of participating in Formula One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine and gearbox mileage. Many teams voiced concerns over the cost of KERS and have suggested a standardised unit, but so far no such opportunity exists. The new rules and regulations saw a new order in 2009, with new teams Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing and their drivers leading the way, with Ferrari and McLaren having a poor season. However, Ferrari started by the British Grand Prix to make the most of their car with a string of podium finishes and a race victory in Belgium, while a redesign of the McLaren challenger helped Lewis Hamilton to win two races and gain more points than any other driver after it was upgraded at the German Grand Prix.

After dominating the beginning of the season with six out of seven race wins, Jenson Button eventually clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship in Brazil, with Brawn GP winning the Constructors&#x27; Championship in its only season, before being taken over by Mercedes. Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button&#x27;s teammate, was second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the whole season until he had a problem at the Brazilian Grand Prix and was overtaken (in points) by Sebastian Vettel, a Red Bull driver, who won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish eleven points behind Button. Also, the major manufacturer teams were starting to disappear rapidly due to the worldwide economy crisis. In addition to Ford/Jaguar which had left in 2004, Honda had departed in 2008 also due to uncompetitiveness, Toyota and BMW both departed entirely in 2009 (BMW sold Sauber, a team it had bought in 2005 after its split with Williams even though in 2010 the team was still called BMW Sauber), Renault changed their involvement as a full works effort to engine supplier in 2011 and Cosworth departed entirely as an engine supplier in 2013.
 saw more changes in the way of rules and regulations. KERS and double diffusers were banned for the 2010 season, but new innovative features on the cars such as F-ducts were introduced. An allocated eight engines, per driver, for the whole season was also introduced as part of more cost-cutting methods. The biggest change in the points scoring system in F1 history happened between 2009 &amp; 2010. The &quot;10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1&quot; point system for the top eight finishers (which had been running since 2003), was replaced with the drastically different &quot;25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1&quot; for the top-10 finishers.

Red Bull Racing returned to have a great season in 2010, thanks to their hiring of designer Adrian Newey in 2007. They won the Constructors&#x27; Championship in the penultimate round in Brazil, and Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel won the championship in the final round of the 2010 season at Abu Dhabi. Mercedes GP (formerly Brawn GP) had a much less successful and winless season than 2009 with their two new drivers – seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher had returned to Formula One, but was regularly beaten by fellow German, Nico Rosberg.

McLaren and Ferrari had better seasons in 2010, finishing respectively second and third among the constructors. The Drivers&#x27; Championship was very closely fought, with six drivers leading the championship at various points, in the joint longest ever (nineteen-race) season. For most of the season, the title looked like it could have gone to either Red Bull&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel or Mark Webber, or either McLaren&#x27;s Lewis Hamilton or reigning World Champion Jenson Button (also at McLaren). But, the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso clawed back 47 points after the British Grand Prix, to be leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with two races left. A record four drivers were still in contention for the title going into the final round in Abu Dhabi. They were Alonso, Webber, Vettel and Hamilton (placing in that order in number of points before the race). They did not finish that way though, with Vettel winning the race and the title when the others finished too far down the field. Vettel became the youngest ever World Champion in the history of the sport.

After a controversial race in Hockenheim, 2010 led to the ban on team orders being dropped. When Ferrari asked Felipe Massa to move over to allow their No.1 driver Fernando Alonso into the lead of the race and take the win, they were fined $100,000. The FIA decided that the rule was too vague, and there was nothing they could do to enforce it. This led to an end to the ban on team orders for the 2011 Formula One season. Other changes included a re-introduction KERS, the introduction of the Drag reduction system (DRS) (a driver activated moveable flap on the cars rear wing), and a change in tyre supplier from Bridgestone to Pirelli. Vettel and Red Bull lead their respective championship from the start until the end of the season, dominating and taking their second successive titles. Vettel also became the youngest double world champion when he clinched the title at the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix, Red Bull took the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the following race in South Korea.

McLaren and Ferrari finished second and third in the standings once again, albeit much further behind. Button eventually took second place in the standings, with Webber in third once again. Vettel took 11 victories throughout the course of the year, broke the record for the most pole positions in a season (15) and the most championship points (392). After a slow start to the 2012 season, Vettel won 4 races in a row and challenged Fernando Alonso and Ferrari all the way through. Eventually, the German Vettel took the lead from the Spanish Alonso and Vettel opened up a 13-point gap come the last round in Brazil. Vettel won his third consecutive Drivers&#x27; title after finishing 6th at Interlagos, while Alonso finished 2nd. 2013 also went Vettel&#x27;s way: the superiority of the Red Bull in race trim allowed the German to open up a small lead early in the season, and starting with the Belgian Grand Prix (after F1&#x27;s 4-week summer break), the superiority of the Red Bull car began to show. The British-based Austrian team had developed an engine-mapping system that gave their car a type of traction control (actual traction control systems are illegal), and Vettel used this to his considerable advantage. He won in Belgium and after that, the rest of the remaining races in the season (9 races total). The German and the Red Bull team simply ran away with the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships, both of which they won in India – Vettel won his 4th consecutive Drivers&#x27; Championship there. Come the Korean round, 2 rounds before the Indian one, Red Bull had developed a special aerodynamic diffuser that gave the cars a considerable cornering advantage. Vettel and his Australian teammate Mark Webber were leading 1–2 for most of those 9 races, and the cars often qualified in the top 3 grid spots; and when they qualified 1–2, it was often by considerable amounts of time.

=== Introduction of 1.6-litre turbocharged V6 hybrid power units and cost cap (2014–2021) ===

:&quot;See 2014 season, 2015 season, 2016 season, 2017 season, 2018 season, 2019 season, 2020 season, 2021 season and Formula One engines.&quot;

Formula One entered its second turbocharged era in 2014. Australia was the location of the end of the first era (Adelaide 1988) and start of the second (Melbourne 2014). The series is being run under the most radical engine regulation changes since 1995. All cars entering any Formula One championship race must run with 1.6-litre single turbocharged 6-cylinder engines with a rev limit of 15,000 rpm and maximum fuel flow of 100 kg/hr. New car regulations will also be enforced, and the minimum weight regulations will be raised from 642 kg (1,415 lb) to 690 kg (1,521 lb). Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault produced engines from 2014 with Honda producing engines from 2015; Cosworth did not participate from 2014 and beyond. In-season engine development returned; the previous V8&#x27;s development was frozen. The new turbo engines produce 600 bhp (the previous V8s produce approximately 750 hp); but the new energy recovery system (ERS) would be twice as powerful as the previous KERS system; this new ERS system would give the drivers up to the equivalent of 160 hp when activated, whereas the previous KERS gave cars an extra 80 hp when activated. Since 2017 new rules about aerodynamics and the consistent improvement of the engines, that now reach around 1000 hp, have made the cars finally faster than the 2004 ones, breaking numerous track records.

The Mercedes team and their drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg dominated the start of the hybrid era, winning 51 of the 59 races (31 for Hamilton and 20 for Rosberg) between 2014 and 2016 as well as all titles during that period (Hamilton was champion in 2014 and 2015 while Rosberg won in 2016). This success was the result of Mercedes&#x27; development of the &quot;split turbocharger&quot;, a system in which the compressor and turbine components of the turbo charger are placed at separate sides of the engine and connected by a rod running through the V of the engine. This new technology gave Mercedes and their customer teams many advantages over their competitors due to the need for less cooling and a more compact power unit.

Ferrari and their driver Sebastian Vettel emerged as strong title contenders in 2017 and 2018 after rule changes in aerodynamic design were implemented for 2017, but despite mid-season championship leads for Vettel in both seasons, Hamilton and Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare. Mercedes subsequently won both championships comfortably in 2019 and 2020 along with an additional constructors&#x27; title in 2021, with Hamilton managing to equal Michael Schumacher&#x27;s record of seven World Championships. In 2021, Mercedes faced stiff competition from the Honda-powered Red Bull team, whose driver Max Verstappen won the Drivers&#x27; Championship after a season-long battle with Hamilton to end the run of Mercedes only winning titles in the hybrid era.

=== Ground effect cars and aerodynamic changes for closer racing (2022–2025) ===
:&quot;See 2022 season, 2023 season&quot;

In 2022, the FIA designed a new set of rules designed to promote &quot;closer racing.&quot; This mostly included aerodynamic changes. Citing a loss of downforce in a trailing car caused by dirty air, the FIA introduced a new type of car designed around using ground effect to create downforce. This was the first time ground effect was used since venturi tunnels under cars were banned in 1983. In the previous cars, air led off the car in a chaotic pattern, creating &quot;dirty air&quot; that decreased the downforce of the car right behind it. The new 2022 car uses ground effect to create downforce, meaning there is less drag and dirty air behind the car. This promotes closer racing as it allows attacking cars to get up closer to the leading car, increasing the number of risky overtakes per race. This is done by simplifying the exterior of the car and instead using the floor to generate downforce, instead of sending air outwards or under the car into the diffuser. A newer front wing is designed to prevent outwash. Ground effect features in the car also allow the car to follow leading cars better by decreasing the effect of dirty air on its downforce. Bargeboards were eliminated and a newer front wing with simpler endplates to decrease the complexity of aerodynamic components. The front wings were also required to directly attach to the nosecone, which has an increased height. The wider rear wings are mounted higher, and regulations limit the teams&#x27; ability to use exhaust gases to increase downforce. The number of aerodynamic upgrades a team can make to the car was decreased, to cut the costs of competing. Although the cars used the same 1.6-litre turbocharged V6 hybrid engines from the previous era, the engines also included new sensors and standard components. This increases the FIA&#x27;s ability to monitor the power units. However, there were changes made to the type of fuel in the engines. In 2022, the percentage of bio-components in fuel increased from 5.75% in previous years to 10%, moving to E10 (ethanol) fuels. This is designed to make Formula 1 more sustainable, as well as align better with road car fuel regulations.

After a slow season beginning dominated by Scuderia Ferrari, Red Bull Racing dominated the season. Their drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Pérez dominated most races. The season ended with Verstappen winning the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and Red Bull winning the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Verstappen ended the season with 454 points, the highest number of points in one season ever recorded. He was 146 points ahead of Charles Leclerc in second place and his teammate Pérez in third.

In 2023, Verstappem cruised to his third consecutive Drivers&#x27; Championship title clinching it at the Qatar Grand Prix, winning a record 19 out of 22 Grands Prix held and finishing on the podium 21 times (also a record number for most podiums in a season) by the end of the championship. His team, Red Bull Racing achieved their sixth Constructors&#x27; Championship title, the second consecutively, at the preceding Japanese Grand Prix. Red Bull Racing won 21 out of 22 Grands Prix, breaking the team record for highest percentage of Grand Prix wins in a season at 95.45%, beating McLaren&#x27;s 1988 season, the only 2023 Grand Prix to elude them being the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix won by Carlos Sainz in a Ferrari. Verstappen also broke the record for the highest Grand Prix win percentage for drivers, with a win rate percentage of 86.36%, beating the previous record set by Alberto Ascari in 1952.

== Relative importance of car quality to driver skill (1950–2020) ==
In 2020, the British magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; ranked champion drivers by the relative importance of car quality to driver skill, based on a study by Andrew Bell of the University of Sheffield, UK. This ranking considers the relative statistical significance of the car maker&#x27;s contributions:
# Juan Manuel Fangio (2.9)
# Jim Clark (2.6)
# Alain Prost (2.1)
# Jackie Stewart (1.95)
# Michael Schumacher (1.9)
# Lewis Hamilton (1.8)
# Alberto Ascari (1.75)
# Ayrton Senna (1.7)

The ranking illustrates that over time car quality has become more important. For example, Michael Schumacher won 5 of his 7 titles (1994–2004) with a single car maker (Ferrari). Lewis Hamilton won all of his 7 titles (2008–2020) with a Mercedes-Benz engine (one of them in conjunction with McLaren). In the 1950s, Juan Manuel Fangio won his 5 titles (1951–1957) with four different teams: Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Maserati.

<text>The green-backed eremomela (Eremomela canescens) is a member of the Cisticolidae. This bird is a common resident breeder in tropical Africa from Kenya and Ethiopia to Cameroon.

This tiny passerine is typically found in open woodland. The green-backed eremomela builds a cup-shaped nest of leaves and silk low in a bush or tree. The normal clutch is two eggs.

<text>Richard Roxburgh (born 23 January 1962) is an Australian actor and filmmaker. He is the recipient of a number of accolades across film, television, and theatre, including several AFI and AACTA Awards, Logie Awards, and Helpmann Awards.

He began his career working with the Sydney Theatre Company. He went on to appear in Australian and international productions such as Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s films &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001) and &quot;Elvis&quot; (2022), the ABC series &quot;Rake&quot; (2010–2018), and the action films &quot;&quot; (2000), &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003), and &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004).

==Early life and education==
Richard Roxburgh was born on 23 January 1962. His parents were John, an accountant, and Mary Roxburgh. He grew up in Albury, New South Wales.

Roxburgh studied economics at the Australian National University in Canberra, where he resided at Garran Hall and graduated with a B.Ec. in 1984. 

After graduating from ANU, he decided to become an actor and was admitted to the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) on his second audition attempt, graduating in 1986.

==Career==

Roxburgh began working with the Sydney Theatre Company as soon as he graduated from NIDA, and also worked with Belvoir St Theatre.

He came to public attention for his portrayal of New South Wales Police Force detective Roger Rogerson in the 1995 television miniseries &quot;Blue Murder&quot;. Through the 1990s, he appeared in several Australian film and stage productions including a critically acclaimed turn as Hamlet alongside Geoffrey Rush, Jacqueline McKenzie and David Wenham in the 1994 Company B production at the Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney. In December 2007, he played the lead character, Roland Henning, who suffered writer&#x27;s block in Michael Gow&#x27;s play, &quot;Toy Symphony&quot;, at the Belvoir St Theatre, winning the 2008 Helpmann Award for best male actor in a play.

In 2000, Roxburgh appeared in the first of several international blockbuster films as the main villain&#x27;s henchman Hugh Stamp in the John Woo-directed &quot;&quot;, which was filmed in Sydney. Also filmed in Sydney was Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001), in which Roxburgh played the Duke of Monroth.

Roxburgh appeared as three iconic characters over the next three years: he played Sherlock Holmes in 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, Holmes&#x27;s nemesis Professor Moriarty in 2003&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; and Count Dracula in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. He is one of only two actors to have played all three of these characters, the other being Orson Welles, who played them in separate radio programs.

Roxburgh directed his first film, &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot; starring Eric Bana, released in 2007. This film won the AFI Award in December 2007 and was nominated for several more. In 2008 and 2009, he played the lead role of Art Watkins in the ABC drama series &quot;East of Everything&quot;.

In July 2010, Roxburgh played former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke in a telemovie based on Hawke&#x27;s life. He reprised the role in the 2020 episode &quot;Terra Nullius&quot; of the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

In November 2010, Roxburgh co-created and began starring in the critically acclaimed ABC1 television comedy-drama series &quot;Rake&quot; as the brilliant but self-destructive Sydney criminal barrister Cleaver Greene, a role for which he won the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Award for Best Lead Actor in a Television Drama in 2012. He stars in &quot;Matching Jack&quot;, which was released in August 2010, and &quot;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot;, released in September 2010.

Returning to the stage, Roxburgh played Vanya opposite Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and John Bell in Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s 2010 production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. In 2013, he again performed at the STC with Weaving as the protagonists in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Weaving as Vladimir and Roxburgh as Estragon. In 2014, Roxburgh played the title role in Edmond Rostand&#x27;s 1897 play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; at the STC. In 2015, Roxburgh appeared in Andrew Upton&#x27;s adaptation of Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Platonov&quot;, titled &quot;The Present&quot;, for the STC. It was directed by John Crowley and featured Cate Blanchett, Jacqueline McKenzie, Marshall Napier, and Toby Schmitz. That production moved in 2016/17 to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in New York City for the Broadway debut of Roxburgh and the rest of the cast.

In 2023, he appeared in &quot;Aunty Donna&#x27;s Coffee Cafe&quot; as a parody of his previous role in &quot;Rake&quot;.

In 2024 Roxburgh appeared in the Stan series &quot;Prosper&quot;, a thriller set in the megachurch community.

Roxburgh played the lead role in the feature film &quot;The Correspondent&quot;, as journalist Peter Greste. &quot;The Correspondent&quot;, directed by Kriv Stenders, was screened as the opening film of the Adelaide Film Festival in October 2024, along with the animated feature &quot;Lesbian Space Princess&quot;, in which he was one of the cast of voice actors. 

==Children&#x27;s literature==
Roxburgh wrote and illustrated the well-received, 240-page children&#x27;s adventure fiction title, &quot;Artie and the Grime Wave,&quot; published by Allen &amp; Unwin in October 2016 ().

==Personal life==
Roxburgh met Miranda Otto after meeting on the set of &quot;Doing Time for Patsy Cline&quot; in 1997; they were in a relationship until 2000.

He married Italian-born opera singer, actress, blogger, cookbook author, and television cookery show personality Silvia Colloca in 2004. They met on the set of &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, playing Count Dracula and his bride, respectively. They have three children.

<doc id="640150" wikidata="Q1236503" url="?curid=640150" title="Publius Cornelius Dolabella (consul 10)">
<text>Publius Cornelius Dolabella (fl. c.10–c.28 AD) was a Roman senator active during the Principate. He was consul in AD 10 with Gaius Junius Silanus as his colleague. Dolabella is known for having reconstructed the Arch of Dolabella (perhaps formerly the Porta Caelimontana) in Rome in AD 10, together with his co-consul Junius Silanus. Later, Nero used it for his aqueduct to the Caelian Hill.

In 24 he was appointed proconsul of the province of Africa (modern Tunisia), supposedly pacified after ten years of insurgency. This turned out to be far from the case and Dolabella was pressed hard. Despite only having half the number of soldiers of his predecessor Dolabella conceived an effective strategy. He eventually forced the insurgents to battle, slew their leader, Tacfarinas, and brought the conflict to a conclusion. He then initiated the conversion of the Tunisian grasslands to arable fields, which were to be the breadbasket of Rome for centuries to come.

==Family==

Dolabella was a member of a patrician branch of the gens Cornelii. Tacitus provides us with the hint that he was the son of Quinctilia, a sister of the Roman politician and general Publius Quinctilius Varus, and a Publius Cornelius Dolabella; however, authorities differ over which Dolabella was his father. In his book &quot;The Augustan Aristocracy&quot;, Ronald Syme identifies the father with Publius Cornelius Dolabella, consul in 44 BC and son-in-law of Cicero. At the time, he was the only Cornelius Dolabella known to fit. However, since the publication of Syme&#x27;s book, a new fragment of the &quot;Fasti Tauromenium&quot; has been recovered which attests to another one: Publius Cornelius Dolabella, suffect consul in 35 BC. Patrick Tansey provides several arguments that favour identifying the consul of 35 BC as the father of the consul of AD 10. Frank Burr Marsh believes that the consul of 44 BC was the grandfather of the consul of 10 AD.

Dolabella married Sulpicia Galbilla, and their son was Publius Cornelius Dolabella, consul in 55.

== Biography ==
Dolabella served as consul from January to June 10 AD with Gaius Junius Silanus. Around the time he held the consulate Cornelius Dolabella was co-opted into two Roman priesthoods: the &quot;septemviri epulones&quot;, one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods, and the lesser order of the &quot;sodales Titensis&quot;.

When the emperor Augustus died in 14, Dolabella was governor of Dalmatia. Augustus&#x27; successor Tiberius, as came to be habitual, delayed the end of Dolabella&#x27;s tenure to 19 or 20; the next governor of Dalmatia, Lucius Volusius Saturninus, found himself delayed in the office until after Tiberius died in the year 37.

Once back in Rome, Dolabella is recorded as twice making excessively sycophantic proposals that Tiberius rejected. The first was in the year 21, following Gaius Silius&#x27; suppression of a rebellion of Gaulish debtors led by Julius Florus and the Aeduan Julius Sacrovir. Dolabella proposed that Tiberius return from Campania and enter Rome with an ovation for the victory. Tiberius rejected the proposal with an angry letter, stating that he was not so destitute of renown as to covet the meaningless honour of a tour of the neighbourhood of Rome. The second was in the following year, when his colleague in the consulship, Junius Silanus, was condemned for &quot;majestas&quot;. Dolabella proposed an inquiry into the morals of provincial magistrates with Tiberius as the judge. Tiberius rejected this proposal because a crime should always precede any punishment.

===Africa===

Dolabella was awarded the proconsular governorship of Africa for AD 23–24. The previous proconsul had been Blaesus, the uncle of Sejanus, Tiberius&#x27; commander of the Praetorian Guard and trusted right-hand man. His main concern had been combatting the 10-year uprising led by Tacfarinus, a Numidian Berber and deserter from the Roman army. After a war of attrition Blaesus&#x27; campaign achieved its crowning success in AD 22, when his men captured Tacfarinas&#x27; brother. Tiberius accepted this as marking the end of the war. He granted Blaesus the rare privilege of adopting the honorary title of &quot;imperator&quot;, &quot;victorious general&quot;, the last time this was accorded to a person outside the imperial house, and the third awarded for defeating Tacfarinas. When Blaesus returned to Rome at the end of his term in 23, he was also accorded triumphal honours. The emperor ordered the withdrawal of Legio IX Hispana from Africa, confident that it was no longer needed. But Tacitus suggests that Blaesus and Tiberius were being over-optimistic about the situation, given that Tacfarinas himself was still at large with a substantial following.

The Romans were soon disabused of their complacency. Tacfarinas&#x27; great strength was that there was an inexhaustible supply of would-be raiders among the desert tribes. So even if he lost many of his followers in encounters with the Romans, which he frequently did, he could rapidly reconstitute his raiding-bands. Moreover, Tacfarinas started posing as the leader of a war of national liberation. He used the news of the withdrawal of half the Roman garrison to spread rumours that the empire was crumbling due to native revolts in its other regions, forcing the Romans to run down their forces in Africa. He claimed that the remaining garrison could be overcome, and Numidia permanently freed, by a concerted effort of all Numidians. His propaganda was highly effective and large numbers of Mauri warriors joined him, turning their backs on their young pro-Roman king, Ptolemy, who had recently succeeded his father, Juba II. In addition, many peasants, the poorest stratum of society, abandoned their fields and joined the insurgents. Tacfarinas also received &quot;deniable&quot; assistance from the king of the Garamantes, who, although officially allied with Rome, was making handsome profits as receiver of Tacfarinas&#x27; plunder and consequently made little effort to prevent substantial numbers of his warriors from joining the insurgents. Given the emergency, Dolabella would have been justified in requesting the postponement of the 9th Legion&#x27;s imminent departure. However, he did not dare confront Tiberius with the grim reality of the situation in Africa.

By the start of the 24 campaign season, Tacfarinas felt strong enough to lay siege to the Roman strong-point of Thubuscum (Khamisa, Algeria or Teboursouk, Tunisia). Dolabella hurriedly assembled all his available troops and rushed to raise the siege. As usual, the Numidians proved unable to withstand the Roman infantry charge and were routed by the first assault; they fled westwards into Mauretania. Dolabella now embarked on an all-out effort to hunt down the ever-elusive Tacfarinas, as it was evident that, unless its leader was eliminated, the insurgency would never end. The proconsul summoned assistance from Ptolemy, in whose kingdom Tacfarinas had taken refuge, and who supplied large numbers of the Mauri horsemen who had remained loyal to him. Thus reinforced, Dolabella divided his force into four divisions advancing in parallel to cover as much territory as possible, with the allied cavalry acting as scouts, criss-crossing between the main columns.

These tactics soon paid off, as the crucial intelligence was obtained that Tacfarinas had established a camp near the half-ruined fort of &quot;Auzea&quot; (Sour el-Ghozlane, south-east of Algiers), which Tacfarinas&#x27; men had previously burnt down. Well to the west of the Roman province, the site was surrounded by extensive forests. Tacfarinas evidently discounted the possibility that the Romans could discover his location, as he apparently failed to post a screen of sentries in the woods. Dolabella immediately despatched a strike-force of lightly-armed infantry and Numidian cavalry. They approached Tacfarinas&#x27; camp unobserved, under cover of the woods and the pre-dawn darkness. At dawn the Romans attacked the camp in full battle-order as the disorganised Numidians scrambled to pick up their weapons and to find their horses. The complete surprise resulted in a massacre, made all the bloodier by the Romans&#x27; lust for revenge after years of humiliation. Acting on strict orders the Roman centurions directed their men against Tacfarinas himself. The latter and his entourage were soon surrounded by overwhelming numbers and in a fierce fight his bodyguards were killed and his son taken prisoner. Recognising that there was no possibility of escape, Tacfarinas impaled himself on the massed spears of his assailants.

The death of Tacfarinas put an end to Musulamii hopes of halting the Roman takeover of their traditional grazing lands. Dolabella launched the registration of the whole plateau for tax purposes immediately after Tacfarinas&#x27; demise and completed it by 29 or 30, as evidenced by the stone markers laid down by the Roman surveyors, some of which survive to this day. The surveyors reach as far as the Chott el Jerid on the province&#x27;s southern border. The region was largely turned to grain production and the Musulamii and other tribes permanently excluded from their former grazing areas.

Dolabella applied to the Senate for triumphal honours. His motion was voted down at the behest of Tiberius, despite the fact that arguably Dolabella deserved the accolade more than any of his three predecessors; unlike them, he had actually brought the war to an end by eliminating its instigator. Tacitus suggests that the reason was Sejanus&#x27; concern that his uncle&#x27;s glory should not be diminished by comparison. Doubtless Tiberius&#x27; embarrassment that the war had flared up again after he had declared it won also played a part.

===Later life===

Tacitus mentions Dolabella twice more in the surviving portions of his &quot;Annales&quot;. In 28 Dolabella joined in the prosecution of his cousin Publius Quinctilius Varus. It is not known what Varus was charged with, but it may have been treason or maiestas. The outcome of the case is unknown, but the absence of his family from history makes it likely that Varus was either condemned or committed suicide. The date of Dollabella&#x27;s death is not recorded.

<text>The London, Tilbury and Southend line, also known as Essex Thameside, is a commuter railway line on the British railway system. It connects Fenchurch Street station, in central London, with destinations in east London and Essex, including , , , , Tilbury, Southend and .

Its main users are commuters travelling to and from London, particularly the City of London which is served by Fenchurch Street, and areas in east London including the Docklands financial district via London Underground and Docklands Light Railway connections at and . The line is also heavily used by leisure travellers, as it and its branches serve a number of seaside resorts, shopping areas and countryside destinations. Additionally, the Tilbury Loop portion of the route provides an artery for freight traffic to and from Dagenham Dock and the Tilbury and London Gateway ports. Freight traffic can also travel further using the connection to the Gospel Oak to Barking line and the Great Eastern Main Line at Forest Gate Junction, allowing access to other main routes.

Built by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway Company – a joint venture between the London and Blackwall Railway and the Eastern Counties Railway companies – the railway was authorised in 1852, with the first section opening in 1854. The route was extended in phases and partnerships were formed with the Midland Railway and District Railway to provide through-services.

The railway serves three main routes. The main line runs from Fenchurch Street to Shoeburyness via Basildon over a distance of . A loop line between Barking and provides an alternative route via Rainham (Essex), Grays and Tilbury. Finally, there is a short branch line connecting the main line at Upminster with the loop line at Grays via . The line has a maximum speed limit of , although the and electric trains which run on it are capable of speeds of .

The line forms part of Network Rail&#x27;s strategic route 6. It is classified as a London and South East commuter line. Passenger services form the Essex Thameside franchise that is currently operated by train operating company c2c.

== History ==

=== Initial construction (1840–1858) ===
The first part of the line was built by the London and Blackwall Railway whose line from Blackwall opened in 1840 with a terminus at Minories and intermediate stations on the route at Shadwell and Stepney. The line had two independent tracks which were initially worked by cable haulage and it was not until 1848 that steam locomotives were deployed. The line was extended to the current London terminus at and operations commenced on 20 July 1841. A short-lived station opened on the route at Cannon Street Road in 1842 but this closed by 1848.

The L&amp;BR built an extension, known as the London and Blackwall Extension Railway, from Stepney station to a junction with the Eastern Counties Railway at Bow but there was a dispute and the junction was never completed. A short lived interchange station at Victoria Park &amp; Bow was built at the junction but saw little traffic which led to a temporary closure of the line in September 1850. In January 1853 a new junction was built at Gas Factory Junction enabling the North London Railway to operate a new service into Fenchurch Street.

The construction of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway was a joint enterprise between the LBR and ECR and was authorised by Parliament on 17 June 1852. The first section, built by Peto and Grissell, was opened between Junction on the Eastern Counties Railway main line and Tilbury, via and on 13 April 1854. The junction at Bow was finally completed and as part of the deal and this enabled the Eastern Counties Railway to also start operating into Fenchurch Street. At the same time a third track was opened on the Fenchurch Street approaches and the station expanded to four platforms.

LT&amp;SR Services initially ran from Fenchurch Street and Bishopsgate stations over existing lines to where they were coupled together and then via Forest Gate Junction to Tilbury for ferry connections to Gravesend.

Further extensions opened in late 1854 to Horndon, to Leigh-on-Sea on 1 July 1855 and finally to Southend on 1 March 1856.

In 1858 a more direct route from London to Barking was constructed through Bromley, and , connecting with the London and Blackwall Extension Railway a very short distance north east of Gas Factory Junction, and the service from Bishopsgate was withdrawn.
=== Route development (1875–1912) ===
Under the management of the LT&amp;SR lessees from 1856 to 1875 little additional work was done to the LT&amp;S lines. After some degree of independence was achieved in 1875 the LT&amp;SR started to take steps to becoming an organisation that could stand on its own two feet. One of the first steps was building its own works/engine shed facility at Plaistow followed by ordering its first locomotives. A station at Upton Park was opened in 1877 largely funded by a developer.

By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed by amalgamation.

In 1866 the LBR was taken over by the GER and all the stations between Fenchurch Street and Stepney became GER stations.

On 5 April 1880 the Limehouse Curve opened with a new junction called Salmon Lane Junction, located between Gas Factory Junction and Stepney it provided a link on to the London and Blackwall line, heading towards Blackwall. The GER ran a short-lived Palace Gates to Blackwall service via Stratford but this only lasted a year and there were some Backwall – Southend excursion trains run in 1890. Primary use of the line was to offer another goods route into the docks.
Under the management of civil engineer Arthur Lewis Stride, the line was extended from Southend to . There was also a direct line built between Barking and Pitsea, with new stations at Hornchurch and Upminster opening in 1884, An intermediate station at Dagenham opened in 1885 and the line extended east to East Horndon and later the same year to a re-sited Pitsea in 1886. Two years later a new station between East Horndon and Pitsea was opened at .

A new station was opened in 1886 at Tilbury Town railway station which was built in conjunction with the building of the rail connected docks next door.

A single-track branch was constructed between and and opened on 1 July 1892 with an intermediate station at Ockendon, The Upminster to Romford section was opened the following year.

The Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway was a joint venture between the Midland Railway and LT&amp;SR and opened on 9 July 1894. This opened the way for through passenger trains from St Pancras to Southend although most trains terminated at Barking.

The approaches to Fenchurch Street were further improved in 1895 with the addition of a fourth track from Stepney to Fenchurch Street.

In 1902, the Whitechapel and Bow Railway was constructed as a joint venture with the District Railway, connecting the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway at Bromley with the District Railway at . The connection allowed through-running of District Railway trains from Central London to provide local services to Upminster from 2 June 1902.

A new station was provided at West Ham in 1901 which was built with four platforms in anticipation of quadrupling to East Ham. The track quadrupling progressed in stages between 1902 and 1905 on the south side of the existing lines which became the Local Lines whilst the newly laid southern lines (known as the Through Lines) were for longer distance services. The Local Lines were electrified allowing District line services to be extended to East Ham.

West of Barking, additional tracks and sidings were provided and the electrified tracks were extended to Barking and that section opened on 1 April 1908.

There were three new stations opened in the years before sale to the Midland Railway which were Dagenham Dock (1908) Thorpe Bay (1910) and for military use only in 1911.

=== Great Eastern Railway/Midland Railway (1912–1923) ===
One of, if not the biggest problem, the Midland Railway (MR) faced when it bought the LT&amp;SR was the rising Southend traffic. Additionally traffic was rising on stations between Plaistow and Barking and there were plans to extend more trains out to Upminster. The Midland Railway saw extension of electrification as part of the answer and in 1913 a report by Merz &amp; Mclellan suggested electrification and four tracking between Campbell Road Junction (west of Bromley station) and Stepney station. West of Stepney a new junction at Ratcliff Square would see six lines as far as Cannon Street Road where the line would then drop underground and either run to Aldgate or via two subterranean additional platforms at Fenchurch Street and onto Bank. The lines would have been electrified and east of Bromley the Through Lines would also have been electrified (the Local Lines being electrified in 1905) and electric trains to Southend were envisaged.

In parallel with this the GER was proposing improvements to Fenchurch Street and a plan was agreed that saw:
* The extension of Platform 1 to take longer GER North Woolwich trains
* The extension of Platform 5 and widening of platforms 4 and 5 to allow longer LTSR peak trains
* Re-arrangement of the approach tracks

This agreement was the end of the Merz &amp; Mclellan scheme, although the Midland Railway still wanted to quadruple Bromley to Stepney and this was presented in a parliamentary bill passed on 7 August 1914. The bill also covered the quadrupling of Barking to Upminster and a curve at Horndon that would have seen a direct link from Barking to Romford built. Although land between Barking and Upminster was purchased the ongoing strain of World War I saw the collapse of all three schemes.

During the war additional day tripper trains to Southend declined (but did not totally disappear). Military supplies ran to Shoeburyness and Dagenham Dock and Tilbury was the arrival point for many American servicemen between 1917 and 1918. They were moved to camps all over the country by rail. After the end of the war Purfleet was a major demobilisation centre and rail was again used to disperse the former troops throughout the country. Records show that LT&amp;SR locomotives worked as far as Wood Green (Alexandra Palace) on the Great Northern line from London Kings Cross. 

The war slowed down the rise in traffic and house building at Southend was paused until the 1920s. The nature of traffic at Fenchurch Street was changing as passenger numbers fell on the GER Blackwall and North Woolwich services. As these services declined and were withdrawn, the LT&amp;SR was allowed to run additional trains in their stead.

The Railways Act 1921 saw the Midland Railway become part of the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway whilst the GER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway.

=== London &amp; North Eastern Railway and London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (1923–1947) ===
A new service for workers from Tilbury and East Tilbury to Thames Haven began on 1 January 1923 – the last service had run in 1909. There were four intermediate halts at Mayes Crossing, Curry Marsh, London &amp; Thames Haven Oil Wharves and Thames Haven.

A new halt called Gale Street Halt was opened between Barking and Dagenham station on 28 June 1926 to serve the nearby Becontree Estate although initially the station was not connected by road.

==== The 1929 LMS plan ====
This plan was to see comprehensive investment in new facilities to improve operations as well as additional stations on the LTS Line. Fenchurch Street was not part of the scheme (even though proposals had been made in 1914 and 1924) but a scheme was adopted and agreed with the LNER in 1931/32 as part of the works which would see a total of 19 LMS trains per hour during the peak.

The Fenchurch Street plan saw a comprehensive rebuild and lengthening of the platforms as well as additional approach tracks (which used part of one of the goods depots) as well as the provision of a new signal box and signalling. The platform rebuild and associated infrastructure was completed by the summer of 1935. The new signalling which gave 90 second headways from Stepney to Gasworks Junction was commissioned by April 1935 and consisted of three and four aspect colour light signalling.

This part of the work was carried out by the LNER who were responsible for the line with the LMS paying 2/3 of the cost.

Other works along with the electrification described below, included:

* An up loop line at East Ham for empty carriage stock moves
* A bay platform at 
* Additional platforms and carriage sidings at 
* Improvements at 
* A new relocated passenger station at 
* A new station at 
* A new station at 
* Additional carriage sidings at 

To support this improvement the LMS built 37 new 3-Cylindered Stanier 2-6-4Ts for the line in 1934 and these were working the line in 1935.

==== Electrification to Upminster ====
Quadrupling and Electrifying the line was first considered in the Midland Railway Act of 1914 and the LMS presented plans in 1928/1929 to extend the four track section to Upminster. There was no mention of the curve to the Romford line. Upminster station had to be completely rebuilt as a result and additional platforms were added for terminating District Line services. The engine shed at Upminster was demolished and rebuilt at this time.

New stations were opened and existing stations had additional platforms added. The stations were staffed by the LMS and from west to east were:-

==== The Metropolitan Line extends east ====
The London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was founded in 1932 and bought the management of the different underground lines under one roof. Discussions between the LMS and LPTB resulted in a decision to route Metropolitan Hammersmith &amp; City trains away from the East London line and to terminate at Barking instead. The provision of a flyover to remove goods trains from crossing the layout was not proceeded with but other changes to improve the flexibility at Barking were made. In addition a bay platform and stabling siding were put in at Dagenham and stabling increased at Upminster. The new Metropolitan line service began on 4 May 1936 and an additional eight hourly services worked in with 27 District Line services. 

==== World War II ====
The impact of World War II on the LTS line was far greater than the first world war as a result of the London Blitz of 1940/1941 and the later deployment of the V1 and V2 flying bombs. The first big event was the evacuation of children from the area and a number of trains were run in late 1939 although many children returned when the extensive aerial bombardment did not materialise. During 1940 a lot of people moved out of towns such as Southend as it was one of the areas expected, by the population at least, to be under threat of invasion. The LMS had to deal with a mass evacuation of children and on 2 June 1940 with 12 trains running to destinations in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.

The timetable was reduced with through District services being cut and other services being cut back but these were minor compared to other areas in the UK. The service was slowed down as the Stanier 3-cylinder 2-6-4Ts were transferred away, and haulage was put back in the hands of the LT&amp;SR and LMS 4-4-2Ts.

The first serious incident was recorded on 18 August 1940 when Shoeburyness station and signal box were bombed and a signalman, Charles Walter Speller, was killed on 18 August 1940. The London Blitz lasted until Saturday 10 May/Sunday 11 May 1941 and Kay records 26 serious incidents between those two dates. There were a few minor raids between 1942 and early 1944. Incidents elsewhere in London also affected the LTS Line, For example, the Metropolitan line services were suspended 9 December 1940 – March 1941 due to air raid damage at Kings Cross.

Some service cuts were made during the blitz including the end of the LNER Fenchurch Street to North Woolwich services (via Bromley and Abbey Mills Junction). 1941 saw the closure of Burdett Road (bomb damage), Shadwell and Leman Street. The latter briefly acted as the London terminal of the line when Fenchurch Street had been put out of service due to bomb damage in September 1940.

The V weapons bombardment first affected the LTS line on 30 June 1944 when a V1 hit the LMS single line at Romford station. A further ten incidents followed with the last on 17 March 1945 when a V2 exploded at Ripple Lane.

=== British Railways (1948–1994) ===
Following nationalisation on 1 January 1948 the LTS line was split so that Fenchurch Street to Gas Factory Junction became part of the Eastern Region whilst the rest of the LTS Line became part of the London Midland Region. This arrangement did not last long and on 20 February 1949 the whole of the LTS line was bought under Eastern Region control. November 1949 saw platforms 1 and 2 at Fenchurch Street electrified through to Bow Junction on the Great Eastern Main Line on the 1500v DC system. No regular electric services worked this line and it was primarily for diversion and emergency usage although regular empty trains ran to ensure the system worked. These were formed of AM6 electric multiple units.

During the brief period of London Midland Region control the little used Purfleet Rifle Range Halt was closed on 31 May 1948. During 1949 East Horndon was renamed West Horndon (where it actually was), Heathway was renamed Dagenham Heathway and Dagenham renamed Dagenham East.

==== The 1953 floods ====
The catastrophic North Sea flood of 1953 flooded parts of the LTS line on 1 February 1953. The affected areas on the LTS line were:

* Purfleet to West Thurrock Junction
* Tilbury Riverside station
* Tilbury to Low Street
* Thames Haven branch
* Benfleet to Leigh on sea.

The last section cut the Southend end of the line off from the London end and a significant number of locomotives and carriages were effectively marooned. Additional services were put in from Southend Victoria to Shenfield where passengers could then change to additional express EMU worked services to Fenchurch Street. This later changed to direct services which saw former GE and LNE tender engines visit Fenchurch Street, normally the home of tank engines.

The damage was severe and it was not until 19 February that normal Southend services resumed.

The flooding around Purfleet saw Tilbury traffic diverted via Ockenden with normal services being restored on the same date. 

The line was further flooded in 1958 but not to the extent of 1953.

==== Coronation and Southend centenary celebrations ====
The 1953 Coronation of Elizabeth II was a major event that took place on 2 June 1953. The stations at Fenchurch Street and Tilbury Riverside were both decorated to celebrate the event.

To celebrate 100 years of the arrival of the railway at Southend, 79 Class 4-4-2T Thundersley which had been restored to LT&amp;SR grey livery, worked two special trains and an exhibition of locomotives was held at Southend station between 1 March and 3 March 1956. The locomotives included LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard, British Railways class EM2 no 27002, and new diesel multiple unit and electric multiple units that were entering service on the LTS line.

==== Separation of the District line ====
The need for more District Line services led to discussions with the London Transport Executive(LTE), which had replaced the LPTB in the early 1950s. The main problems were goods train crossing moves at Bromley, Little Ilford and Barking East prevented more trains operating on the District Line. To ensure total separation the Grays to Romford service would need to be split into distinct halves at Upminster, although a flyover was briefly considered. This meant the Romford line disconnected from the rest of the LTS line. The railway executive division of the British Transport Commission were initially opposed to the idea but on 17 July 1952 the Eastern Region was instructed to engage with the LTE on this issue.

The LTE took over the electric supply of the Local Lines whilst main line electrification which would have a different supply was being progressed. The electrification plan had already predicted the end of the former goods exchange sidings at Plaistow and West Ham (which would move to the new Ripple Lane marshalling yard) and the closure of Plaistow Engine Shed (on the northern side of the Local Lines). This meant the closure of the Bow to Bromley curve was feasible with traffic being routed via Forest Gate Junction of the T&amp;FG line and this happened on 11 September 1959.

Various crossovers between the two sets of lines and sidings were removed during this project and the canopies were removed from the main line platforms. A summary of the changes is shown below but does not include other changes such as goods yard closures which happened in the 1960s. Also during this time London Transport (LT) re-signalled the Local Lines between 1958 and 1960 with a new LT signal box at Upminster and a facility shared with BR at Barking. BR re-signalled the main lines in 1960 to 1961 which saw the abolition of many of the old signal boxes. It was shortly after this period that the Limehouse Curve was closed on 5 November 1962. 

* Campbell Road Junction – Signal Box abolished
* Bromley – NLR Junction removed 27 September 1959 – Signal Box stopped controlling local lines. The signal box was later abolished in 1961. Goods Yard closed 1964.
* Abbey Mills Junction – reduced to sidings and then closed 7 August 1960
* West Ham – West Ham sidings lifted 1958, Connections removed and control of Local Lines ceased 3 October 1959. Signal box abolished 1961. The through island platform was reduced in 1963.
*Plaistow – Up Sidings Box abolished 13 September 1959 after which sidings used to stable carriage trains between peaks. Signal box abolished 1961. The up side (engine shed and carriage sidings) remained in service until May 1962 and were used for storage of withdrawn vehicles awaiting scrap. Connections removed 1963.
*Upton Park – Crossover removed January 1960 and signal box ceased to control Local Lines a month later. Signal box closed May 1961 and remaining goods yard which lasted until 1984 was accessed by ground frame.
*Barking – see below
*Becontree – Signal Box abolished 14 July 1961
*Dagenham East – All crossovers out of use 11 November 1959 – goods yard thought to be closed at same time. Signal Box closed 17 April 1961 – remaining sidings serving May and Bakers served by ground frame
*Hornchurch – crossovers removed c 1959. Signal Box stopped controlling local lines. The signal box was later abolished on 17 April 1961. Remaining sidings serving goods yard served by ground frame
* Upminster – New platform 6 for Romford service opened 19 May 1957. Layout reworked with longer platforms for main line services and District Line depot provided at eastern end of station. Local line control was taken over by the underground on 30 November 1958 and Upminster West box was abolished with re-signalling on 6 February 1961. The goods yard closed around 1964 with all connections removed the following year. The Upminster to Romford line was separated from the rest of the LTS Line in 1968 and after that date rolling stock was supplied via the connection to the GEML at Romford and used the dedicated Platform 6 at Upminster. 

The rebuild at Barking was significant. In addition to re-signalling and electrification changes and the desire to separate the District Line services from British Railways the decision was made to provide a flyover that meant freight trains no longer had to cross the layout. In order to improve the passenger interchange between District Line and British rail (and vice versa) dive-under lines were provided at the west end of Barking and a flyover at the east end.

East Ham depot was also being built on the site of Little Ilford sidings so this meant the closure of Barking goods yard, Little Ilford Sidings and the displacement of District Line stabling to the new depot at Upminster. Some LT stabling sidings were also provided at the west end of Barking.

The line that linked East Ham to Woodgrange Park was also closed as part of this work on 30 November 1958 although in truth it saw little use in its final years. 

==== Electrification ====
The London Plan Working Party Report of 1949, envisaged as its Route G the LTSR electrified and diverted away from Fenchurch Street to and onward through the Waterloo &amp; City line tunnels to Waterloo and its suburban lines. Of course, the Waterloo &amp; City tunnels would have had to be bored out to main-line size for this proposal to succeed.

However, electrification went ahead from 1961 to 1962 under British Railways, but to Fenchurch Street, not to Bank and Waterloo. The direct passenger services from Bromley, Plaistow, , East Ham, , and to Fenchurch Street were withdrawn although the stations retained District Line platforms. With the completion of electrification the remaining through steam services from St Pancras to LTS line destinations were removed.

The line was also re-signalled between 1958 and 1961, starting in the Barking area in April 1958 and completed in August 1961 with the section between Purfleet and West Thurrock Junction. Semaphore signals were replaced with 3- and 4-aspect searchlight signals.

The following stations were altered (in addition to the changes described in the section above):

*West Horndon – Up sidings removed, down sidings relocated. Platforms extended
*Laindon – middle track converted into reversing platform. Platforms extended
* Pitsea – reversing siding lengthened – new footbridge
*Leigh-on-Sea – additional up platform added. Station partially rebuilt. Middle platform now reversibly worked.
*Benfleet – platforms extended
*Westcliff-on-sea – station buildings rebuilt
*Southend Central – changes to track layout/platform extensions

The first electric train formed of AM2 electric multiple unit stock on the line entered service on 6 November 1961.

The last steam train operated out of Fenchurch Street was the 6:10pm to Thorpe Bay on 15 June 1962 which was worked by LMS 3-Cylindered Stanier 2-6-4T number 42501. Steam hauled boat trains and freight trains continued throughout 1962 and 1963 with what is thought to be a final working seen in 1964 when a BR Class 5 4-6-0 led three other locomotives to a scrapyard at Grays. June 1962 also saw the introduction of an accelerated all electric timetable with Southend being reached in 48 minutes during the evening peak.

The Thames Haven branch closed to passengers on 9 June 1958. During the 1960s many of the local goods yards closed but only one station – , which closed on 5 May 1967. Westcliff-on-Sea station was renamed Westcliff on 20 February 1969.

==== The 1970s ====
In 1972, the British Railways Board (BRB) proposed to construct a one-mile freight-only spur line from the railway at Bowers Gifford between Pitsea and Benfleet to East Haven creek and thence to the proposed oil refineries on Canvey Island, to allow petroleum products to be exported from the refineries. Once the layout of the proposed refineries had been established, in early 1974 the BRB sought powers to extend the spur line a further mile from the creek to the site of the refineries through the British Railways Bill 1974. The Bill was subject to considerable opposition in parliament, furthermore a public inquiry proposed to revoke planning permission for one of the refineries. The proposal was abandoned and the BRB removed the spur line proposal from the 1974 Bill.

On 25 November 1974 a station was opened to serve the new town of .

==== The 1980s ====

Upon sectorisation in 1982, the London &amp; South Eastern sector took over responsibility for passenger services in the south-east of England, working with the existing BR business units of Regions and Functions to deliver the overall service. Day-to-day operation, staffing and timetabling continued to be delivered by the Regions – and the sector came into existence with barely thirty staff based at Waterloo.

On 10 June 1986, L&amp;SE was relaunched as Network SouthEast, along with a new red, white and blue livery. The relaunch was intended to be more than a superficial rebranding and was underpinned by considerable investment in the presentation of stations and trains, as well as efforts to improve service standards. Passenger numbers grew, as commuters travelled to the City of London during the Big Bang of the financial markets in the late 1980s. Despite the efforts of Network SouthEast, the performance of and environment on the line became very poor in the 1990s and it was known as the Misery Line.

In 1991 the Docklands Light Railway opened from a new station at Tower Gateway (located on the former Minories station site) to Canary Wharf and Island Gardens. The line was built on a new viaduct adjacent to the LTS line and an interchange was available with LTS services at Limehouse station after which it used the old London &amp; Blackwall Railway route (closed to passengers in 1926).

=== The privatisation era (1994–current day) ===

During the early 1990s proposals were put forward to convert the whole route into a guided busway, however these plans were quickly dismissed when British Rail announced a complete re-signalling of the line.

On 30 November 1992, station was closed. For many years prior to closure, the station was served only by certain trains on the local service from Upminster via Grays, because the nearby Dartford Crossing and increased car ownership had caused a decline in its importance as a passenger ferry terminal. There was some opposition to closure, but British Rail cited financial reasons for the closure with the annual cost of running the service at £180,000 against income of £11,000.

In 1995 a station was built at to serve the new community there as well as Lakeside Shopping Centre. Main line platforms were re-established and opened at in 1999, to provide interchange with the extended Jubilee line and North London line.

In the late 1990s, the line was comprehensively upgraded with new signals, refurbished track and new Class 357 &quot;Electrostar&quot; trains, operated by c2c. Owing to the growth in commuting into London – to the City and Canary Wharf – and the rise in population living in London, passenger numbers on the route have increased substantially, rising by 34% between 2011 and 2019. Freight along the line has also increased, thanks to the Port of Tilbury and the London Gateway port (which opened in 2013), as well as the connection to High Speed 1 for European freight trains.

==Operations==
===Timetables===

Commentary on LT&amp;SR timetables prior to 1912 can be found in the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway entry.

====Early years====
On the London and Blackwall cable railway the trains worked every 15 minutes and the journey time was 13 minutes. The service was operated between 08:45 and 09:45pm. There were regular connecting ferries to Gravesend and Woolwich and it was possible to book through tickets. This pattern was still in place in 1850 (by now the L&amp;BR was a more conventional railway) and there was a through service to Bow on the new extension railway every half hour.

At Fenchurch Street in 1854 there were now four companies operating trains – the LT&amp;SR, The North London Railway (NLR). The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) and the L&amp;BR. The LT&amp;SR services were at this time routed via Stratford and Forest Gate Junction thence Barking and onto Tilbury. ECR services were routed to Loughton and NLR services to Chalk Farm.

====Services to and from Stratford and North Woolwich====
The first Eastern Counties Railway services started operating in 1854 when the main Bishopsgate – Norwich line was connected to the London &amp; Blackwall Extension Railway at Bow Junction. This also enabled LTSR services to access Fenchurch Street which they continued to do until their direct route from Barking to Gas Factory Junction to Barking was opened in 1858.

After that the Bow Junction to Gas Factory Junction line was operated by the ECR and from 1862 the GER. There was one intermediate station at Bow Road which opened in 1876 and was re-sited to provide an interchange with the adjacent NLR station in 1892.

Services varied over the years and included:

* Loughton via Stratford
* North Woolwich via Stratford Market
* North Woolwich via Bromley and Abbey Mills curve.
* Gallions
* Ilford/Gidea Park via Stratford

Regular services from Fenchurch Street to Stratford were withdrawn on 7 November 1949 as a result of the Central Line service commencing operation to Stratford in 1946 and in various stages out to Loughton in 1949. This left the former LTS main line services as the only trains running into Fenchurch Street.

====Midland Railway====
The Midland Railway (MR) bought the LT&amp;SR in 1912 and operated their services until 1923. On takeover the daily number of passengers carried by the MR doubled although the effect on revenue because of the shorter distances was less. MR services survived the war relatively unscathed although there was a deceleration in services that was not properly reversed until 1935. A summary of the regular main line services over the line in January 1918 saw:

*22 services to Southend/Shoeburyness via Laindon
*23 services to Tilbury, 13 of which continued to Pitsea, Southend or Shoeburyness
*3 services to inner locations terminating at Plaistow, Barking and West Ham
*4 services from St Pancras to Southend
*2 services from Ealing to Southend

There was portion working for two services but these disappeared two years later.

====July 1922 peak summary====

In July 1922 Fenchurch Street was served by trains operated by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) and the Midland Railway (MR). Between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. there were 16 departures as follows:

Direct trains to Gallions usually routed via Bromley operated in other hours outside the peak. During the peak hours passengers for Gallions changed at Custom House for a shuttle service.

====North London Railway====
In 1852 Gas Factory Junction was originally opened to provide a link from the North London Railway into Fenchurch Street which acted as their city terminus until was opened in 1866. The GER took over operation of the NLR shuttle between Fenchurch Street and Bow (NLR) in 1869, which it operated until April 1892 when the second Bow Road railway station opened along with a passenger foot connection to the NLR station.

In addition to this the NLR ran a service to Plaistow via the curve linking Bow to Bromley which linked into the LTSR at the west end of Bromley station. This was initially a through train but later became a shuttle from their station at Bow. The service was withdrawn as a wartime economy measure in 1916.

====London Midland and Scottish Railway LTS line services====
The LMS operated services between 1923 and 1947.

By 1924 there was no capacity to add any further services and bar minor changes the timetables remained more or less unchanged until the 1934/5 changes at Fenchurch Street (see above) resulted in capacity for more services.

However, in 1926 the London and Blackwall line from Stepney towards Blackwall closed.
The new timetable started in April 1935 with many improvements to peak hour services but little change to the off peak.

In the morning peak there were now six additional up services from Southend/Shoeburyness and three additional services from the Tilbury Line with a total of 28 trains. In the evening peak the same number of additional services and 22 services. There were an additional seven LNER services per hour.

=====Broad Street services=====
Up morning and down evening peak hour services operated from 1 January 1923. This service was planned by the MR and London North Western Railway in late 1922 but it was operated by the LMS into which those two companies were merged as part of the 1921 Railways Act. The service consisted of an up morning and down evening peak with the carriages being stabled at Devons Road. The locomotive probably returned to Plaistow engine shed.

By 1927 there were three trains per day from the LTS line to Broad Street with one starting at Thorpe Bay, one at Southend and one at Tilbury.

Initially non stop, stops were added to all services at Dalston Junction and the Thorpe Bay service also had Bow and Hackney stops.

Significant improvements to the peak hour LTS line timetable in February 1935 saw the service discontinued from April 1935.

====District Line services====

District Line services starting operating over LTS lines when the Whitechapel and Bow Railway connected to the LTS line at Campbell Road Junction west of Bow. Most services terminated at East Ham but a number of peak services continued to/started from Upminster. These additional services put strain on the two track section to Barking and work started soon after on the quadrupling out to East Ham which opened in 1905 and Barking after substantial remodelling in 1908. As well as quadrupling the lines were electrified out to Barking. With the District Line services stopping at the minor stations the LT&amp;SR removed stops between Barking and Bromley to speed up longer distance trains.

The 1908 District timetable had 163 District Line trains working to East Ham (50) and Barking (112).From 1912 the down side bay at Plaistow was lengthened and electrified allowing District Line trains to terminate there.

From 1910 longer distance services operated from Ealing Broadway via Victoria, Charing Cross and Whitechapel to Southend with some going through to Shoeburyness. The service had limited stops on the District Line and in the July 1912 the 08:00 departure from Ealing Broadway took two hours to reach Shoeburyness. Up to 1911 District Line electric locomotives worked as far as Little Ilford sidings (between East Ham and Barking) where an LT&amp;SR steam locomotive took over. Once Barking platforms 2 and 3 were electrified in 1911 the change took place there. In the up direction the 05:05 and 07:27 departures from Southend allowed for an arrival in Central London before 09:00.

The June 1912 timetable had four weekday (and Saturday) return trips each way and six on Sundays. World War 1 saw the service reduced to two per day and by 1921 this was reduced to one. However the service built up and by 1927 there were six trains per day – three in the morning starting at Upminster and Thorpe Bay and three in the evening, two from Southend and one from Thorpe Bay ( the stock came from Shoeburyness but did not serve the station there). The first eastbound train from Ealing did not depart until 09:35 and was formed from the stock of the early morning 7:02 a.m. departure from Thorpe Bay. Of note were two late evening Ealing Broadway to Southend departures that acted as theatre trains for London West End traffic.

In June 1925 the LMS started re-signalling the local lines between Bromley and Barking to enable more District Line services to run. LMS trains did use the Local Lines but only late at night. The re-signalling was completed by June 1929. The number of District Line trains now operating onto the LTS line was 243 per day.

By 1935 the Southend service had been reduced to four per day and in the May 1939 timetable there was a single service each way. The start of World War 2 saw the introduction of an emergency timetable on the line and the end of through District Line services on 11 September 1939.

====St Pancras services====
In connection with the opening of the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway a daily service started operating between Southend and St Pancras.

This increased in later years and in the August 1913 timetable there were four through trains from St Pancras to Southend as well as a number of summer specials emanating at intermediate stations along the route. However the route was not particularly popular with passengers on the LTS line because most of the trains called at all stations.

Originally operated by the Midland Railway, the LTSR took over and it then returned to Midland operation in 1912. In July 1914 a through coach to Derby was part of the 10:45 a.m. Southend to St Pancras service where it was attached to the 12:15 Liverpool service. Due to the First World War the service was discontinued.

The core service of four trains per day continued until 1939 when the second world war saw the service reduced to two services per day. Four trains were restored post war but the fifties saw further reductions in the service with some services terminating at . By 1958 the service was reduced to one regular weekday and three Saturday services and the following year it was reduced to one Saturday service. The last year a regular booked service ran was June 1962 which ran to/from Kentish Town. After that T&amp;FG passengers had to change at Barking, although a booked through Sunday service ran from Luton non stop via the T&amp;FG through to Southend in 1963.

====1962 all electric timetable====
Following re-signalling, the separation of the District Line and electrification the first electric timetable commenced operation in June 1962.
The off-peak timetable consisted of six trains per hour on a repeating pattern timetable. The departures were:

* xx:00 Fenchurch Street to Southend &amp; Shoeburyness fast service via Laindon – first stop Upminster for connection to Grays via Ockenden then Leigh-on -sea then all stations
* xx:05 Fenchurch Street to Southend &amp; Shoeburyness all stations via Tilbury Riverside (reverse)
* xx:10 Fenchurch Street to Southend &amp; Shoeburyness all stations via Laindon
* xx:30 Fenchurch Street to Southend &amp; Shoeburyness fast service via Laindon – first stop Barking then Benfleet and all stations
* xx:35 Fenchurch Street to Southend &amp; Shoeburyness all stations via Tilbury Riverside (reverse) except Stepney East
* xx:40 Fenchurch Street to Southend &amp; Shoeburyness all stations via Laindon

The morning peak saw 24 arrivals between 7:45 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. with a fast journey time from Southend of 48 minutes. Of note were two trains using the Tilbury avoiding line and offering Stanford-le-hope passengers radically improved journey times.

In the evening peak between 4:30 pm and 6:30 pm there were 29 departures, with the fastest journey time to Southend being the 6:00 pm, marketed as &quot;the Spiv&quot; taking 44 minutes with stops at Leigh-on-Sea, Benfleet and Westcliff.

====May 2020====
This section has been sourced from the online working timetable on the Network Rail site. It is likely that after a period it will be deleted from the site as it becomes out of date.

The published May 2020 working timetable had nine services in the off peak hour from Fenchurch Street and all trains called at Limehouse (formerly Stepney) and West Ham. Developments of the London Docklands into a major commercial centre and connections to the Dockland Light Railway and Jubilee Line sees significant interchange traffic both peak and off-peak. Ockenden and the new station at also enjoyed direct services with a through train that was routed through to Southend.

The morning peak has since seen an increase in services primarily due to the increase in traffic to the City of London and revitalised London Docklands area. Between 07:45 and 09:15 30 services arrived into Fenchurch Street – a further six from 1962. The fastest up service from Southend was the 07:11 departure arriving into Fenchurch Street at 08:00 (49 minutes) with stops at Westcliff and Chalkwell, then fast to West Ham, Limehouse and Fenchurch Street.

In the evening peak there are 37 departures from Fenchurch Street station but times to Southend have slipped with the fastest being around the 52 minute mark. This is due to the operator needing to call at Limehouse and West Ham and more often at intermediate locations that have seen population growth since 1962. During the period of this and the December 2020 timetables some trains would not have run due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

====Holiday and special traffic====
Southend holiday traffic had existed before the arrival of the railway in 1856 with steamers calling at the pier. The LT&amp;SR captured some of this traffic and increased the numbers visiting Southend and that traffic was continued after 1912 by the Midland Railway. World War 1 saw the traffic fall off but not disappear and, after the war holiday traffic returned.

Similarly World War 2 saw holiday traffic drop off during hostilities and then return after hostilities ceased. Changing attitudes to holidays and widespread car ownership in the 1960s saw numbers start to decline.

Boat trains served Tilbury right up until the 1960s and ran from St Pancras, Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street.

===Goods services===
====Goods Traffic 1912====
Prior to 1923 goods traffic would be moved from one railway to an exchange yard or sidings on its border where the locomotive would be detached and replaced by a locomotive of another company to take the train forward.

Before 1912 this activity happened at:

* Barking Goods Yard – Great Eastern to LT&amp;SR
* Woodgrange Park – Midland Railway to LT&amp;SR 1894–1909
* Little Ilford – Midland Railway to LT&amp;SR 1909–1912 after which Midland trains would have worked through to destinations on the LT&amp;SR (possibly with a pilot driver)
* Plaistow/West Ham – North London Railway/London North Western Railway

It was not unknown for &quot;foreign&quot; locomotives to work through to destination but this was the exception rather than the rule.

Goods traffic continued to the multitude of goods depots on the approach to Fenchurch Street (see below), with the Midland now operating the fast goods trains between Commercial Road and Tilbury Docks. Internal LTS line goods trains were worked from Plaistow and Little Ilford.

Following the industrialisation of Thames-side goods traffic increased and Dagenham Dock became a railhead for Fords and Samuel Williams traffic. Other industries around Grays and Purfleet were also generating goods traffic.

===== The approaches to Fenchurch Street =====

A number of goods depots were established near Fenchurch Street owing to the station&#x27;s proximity to the City of London. This table lists the depots connected to the line between the station and Christian Street Junction just east of :
===== Thameside rail served industries =====
The LTS Line between Ripple Lane and Tilbury had numerous sidings serving various industries some of which had their own internal railways or shunting locomotives. The table below shows a selection of these:

====Freight Changes====
Up until the 1940s goods trains on the LTS lines were mostly mixed trains consisting of various wagon types carrying different commodities. During the Second World War, as a result of the risk to coastal shipping from German naval action, block coal trains started running to the LTS line to feed the industrial centres there. Some of this traffic continued after the war but the plans for electrification and separation of the District Line were all going to see the removal of some facilities. There was enough goods still being carried on the railways for a new approach.

In the 1949/1950 a plan was drawn up to develop a marshalling yard at Ripple Lane between Barking and Dagenham Dock, itself a significant railhead for Fords car factory. The LMS already had built a yard on this site in 1937 because Plaistow was at capacity and to serve some local industries. The down side had eight sidings and a run round loop whilst the up sidings had seven sidings and a run round loop. The main line at this stage ran through the site. The new marshalling yard was approved by the British Transport Commission act of 1951. The first signs of the new yard were a facility called the Railhead Depot which was opened in 1957. This allowed Barking goods yard to be closed prior to the extensive re-modelling taking pace at that location.

Around the same time the main lines were diverted around the edge of the new site and by 30 May 1958 the yard was ready for business. A depot for electric locomotives was built and there were also separate facilities for steam locomotives (and a turntable) on the site. In the event the new depot initially saw diesel locomotives. The yard offices were located here and 300 staff were employed on the site at opening. A hump was provided and there were eight fans of six sidings (named A-H) as well as eight reception sidings at the east end and six departure sidings at the west end.

The rail freight market was changing however and block or company trains were becoming more common. These trains were made up of a single wagon type often carrying the produce of a single company. As a result of this and many of the station goods yards being closed the yard contracted and by 1968 the hump and many of the sidings had become disused. Two other significant changes contributed to traffic patterns changing. Firstly the increase in car ownership led to an oil boom and the Thames Haven branch and West Thurrock areas both had refineries for this traffic. Secondly the Port of Tilbury decided on the containerisation model but because the Port of London failed to do so saw an increase in traffic as well.

The table below gives a summary of the block trains working on the LTS line in the May 1969 timetable. The number format is the number of weekday services followed in parentheses by the number of services that run on selected days during the week.


By 1971 Ripple Lane was redeveloped further with a new freightliner (container) terminal being built and opened on 24 October 1971. Many sidings in the yard were lifted and given over to container stacking but new sidings were provided for other traffic.

====Freight in the 1980s to the current day====
Hornchurch and Upton Park goods yards finally closed in 1982 and 1984; coal for domestic use had been the last traffic handled at these locations. The Ripple Lane Railhead depot closed in 1984 (it was a coal depot at this stage). Steel traffic and later newspaper print were handled in the area.

British Rail&#x27;s mixed wagon load network Speedlink which had been formed in 1977 in an attempt to revitalise wagon load freight had been declining during the 1980s and succumbed in 1992.

The 1990s saw a decline in the Thames Haven oil traffic as a result of pipelines and improvements to the motorway network. This had by 1993 been drastically cut by the fact that Shell pulled out of rail traffic. These two events saw the closure of Ripple Lane TMD in early 1994.

In 2004 and 2005 construction sidings were built and used in the Ripple Lane area in connection with the construction of High Speed 1.

Intermodal (container) traffic continued to be handled at Barking and Tilbury Freightliner Terminals (FLT).

The military siding at Pigs Bay closed to traffic in the early 2000s. This site was used to store withdrawn rolling stock during this period.

Work on the London Gateway deep water port started in February 2010 and involved the re-alignment of the Thames Haven line. The first stage of the dock opened in 2013 and there were 9 Intermodal services operating by 2017.

2015 saw a new rail hub opened at Ripple Lane which had a direct connection onto High Speed 1 and in 2017 a through train from China arrived at this terminal.

Forth Ports opened a new intermodal terminal on the old site of the former Tilbury A and B Power station known as the Tilbury 2. The first train serving the terminal ran on 28 November 2020. Forth Ports also operate the other intermodal terminal in the Tilbury area which is known as the London Container Terminal.

===Parcels traffic===
Parcels trains ran from Fenchurch Street to Southend Central with a stop at Dagenham East in 1965. Parcels traffic ceased at Dagenham East c1969 and was also transferred from Southend Central to Southend East that year. Parcels traffic ceased in 1981.

=== Main Line Electrification ===
Electrification of the line and the connecting branches, under various system of traction current, took place in stages as follows:

November 1949
* Fenchurch Street to Bow Junction, electrified at 1.5 kV DC as part of the Great Eastern (Liverpool Street to Shenfield) electrification. Fenchurch Street Platforms 1 and 2 only and former slow (south) lines to Stepney East (now Limehouse) then to Bow Junction via Gas Factory Junction. Abandoned before completion, later wired for emergency use.
November 1960
* Fenchurch Street to Bow Junction converted from 1.5 kV DC to 6.25 kV AC.
November 1961
* Fenchurch Street to Stepney East (now Limehouse), Fenchurch Street Platforms 3 and 4 and fast (north) lines, electrified at 6.25 kV AC,
* Gas Factory Junction to Barking, electrified at 6.25 kV AC,
* Forest Gate Junction to Barking (except Platform 1), electrified at 6.25 kV AC,
* Barking to Southend Central via Upminster, electrified at 25 kV AC,
* Barking to Pitsea via Tilbury, electrified at 25 kV AC,
* Upminster to Grays, electrified at 25 kV AC,
* Southend Central to Shoeburyness, electrified at 6.25 kV AC.
1984
* Fenchurch Street to Barking, converted from 6.25 kV AC to 25 kV AC,
* Gas Factory Junction to Bow Junction, converted from 6.25 kV AC to 25 kV AC,
* Forest Gate Junction to Barking, converted from 6.25 kV AC to 25 kV AC,
* Southend Central to Shoeburyness, converted from 6.25 kV AC to 25 kV AC.
2017
* Barking Station Junction to Barking Station Platform 1, electrified at 25 kV AC.

===Locomotives and Rolling Stock===

====Passenger====
The line was known for its use of 4-4-2 tank engines such as the LT&amp;SR 37 Class and LT&amp;SR 79 Class. The LTS line was run by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway after 1923 and they provided a further 35 locomotives of the 79 Class between 1923 and 1930, before introducing the 3-Cylindered 2-6-4Ts designed by William Stanier in 1934.
During World War II many of the 3-cylindered 2-6-4Ts were transferred away from the area and haulage reverted to older LT&amp;SR locomotives, but the 3-cylindered tanks were back before the end of 1945. After the war ended, and shortly before nationalisation, 20 new LMS Fairburn Class 4 2-6-4Ts were allocated to the line which led to the withdrawal of some of the older LT&amp;SR locomotives.
From 12 November 1953 20 BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4Ts started working on the section and former LT&amp;SR locomotives were reduced to working the Upminster to Grays service. By 1958 these were withdrawn and the last LT&amp;SR passenger locomotive was transferred away to Peterborough in March 1958.

Holiday traffic from the 1920s was worked almost exclusively by LMS type locomotives with LMS Hughes Crab, LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 and 4F 0-6-0.

On 23 January 1957 the Romford – Tilbury service went over to Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) working and these trains also worked the Tilbury to Pitsea Shuttle services. Diesel working of early morning trains was common to allow work on the overhead electric line equipment and this practice continued until 1969. After that date, other than the Romford service the only appearance of DMUs was in connection with engineering works and special trains. The DMUs were allocated to Stratford engine shed and consisted of some of the early DMU class such as Class 109 Wickhams Units and Derby Lightweight units. DMUs were generally stabled at Tilbury overnight.

After electrification in 1962 most services were operated by British Railways Class 302 electric multiple units (EMUs), which were withdrawn in 1998, leaving s, s and some loaned s in service until they were replaced by Class 357 EMUs. These are stabled at Shoeburyness and East Ham depots, where they are also maintained. Six Class 387 trains were used at peak times to increase capacity between 2016 and 2022, however these were transferred to Great Northern.

====Goods====
Up until 1899 LT&amp;SR trains were effectively mixed traffic working but that changed when two locomotives of the 0-6-0 49 class were introduced. In 1903 the first of 10 69 class 0-6-2Ts were ordered for freight traffic and this order was supplemented by a further four locomotives in 1912 ordered by the LT&amp;SR but delivered to the Midland. These locomotives provided the internal LTS workings right up until 1962.

Other steam freight locomotives allocated to the LTS line included:

* MR 2F 0-6-0
* LMS Fowler Class 4F 0-6-0
* LNER Class J17 – 0-6-0 used on engineering trains in the 1950s
* LNER Class J39 – 0-6-0 short lived and unpopular with LTS line crews
* WD Austerity 2-8-0 – heavy freight locomotives based at Plaistow and Tilbury.

The 4-4-2T and 2-6-4T types both worked freight trains throughout their time on the LTS line. 

The first main line diesel to operate over the LTS line was the unique British Rail 10800 which was allocated to Plaistow engine shed and was deployed on freight trains. Devons Road (Bow) engine shed based Class 20 locomotives were seen on freights from 1957 and later in the year LTS drivers were being trained on Class 30 locomotives and a little later the failure prone Class 21. These locomotives worked freight and passenger services.

Class 04 diesel shunters were regularly allocated to Plaistow from 1957.These displaced the LMS built &quot;Jinty&quot; LMS Fowler Class 3F shunting and short distance goods services. When Ripple Lane Marshalling Yard opened Class 11 shunters were employed on shunting duties.

By the 1970s most goods trains were generally in the hands of Class 31, Class 37 and Class 47 locomotives whilst shunting was carried out by Class 08 shunters.

By the 1980s Class 56 and Class 59 could be seen on aggregates trains from the Western Region. Electrification of part of the Ripple Lane complex and Tilbury FLT in 1988 saw electric locomotives such as Class 90 employed on container trains.

In 2021 diesel worked freight services are in the hands of Class 66 and Class 70 locomotives.

====Preservation====

Of the original LTSR locomotive fleet, only 79 class 4-4-2T number 80 named &quot;Thundersley&quot; survives as a stationary exhibit at Bressingham Steam Museum in Norfolk.

Two locomotives that worked later steam services in the area are preserved – 2500 is the sole remaining member of the 37 3 cylinder 2-6-4 tank engines built by the LMS in the 1930s for the LTS line. It is preserved in LMS livery at the National Railway Museum in York.
BR Standard Class 4 80079, which was involved in the 1958 Dagenham East rail crash, is preserved on the Severn Valley Railway in Shropshire. Both 42500 (as it was then numbered) and 80079 worked last day steam services out of Fenchurch Street.

Two Class 302 driving trailers are preserved at Mangapps Farm Railway Museum near Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex.

===Stations (2021)===
* Number of passenger entries/exits in millions in 2017/18
* Year station was first served by the LTSR (could have been served earlier by another railway)
* Typical off-peak Monday-Saturday service frequency in trains per hour (tph)
* Service suspended in 1913 but reintroduced in 1999

====Route via Stratford and Liverpool Street====

When necessary, due to engineering work or service disruption, trains can be diverted at Barking over the Gospel Oak to Barking line and then the Great Eastern Main Line to call at Stratford and Liverpool Street instead of the usual LTSR route via . Trains diverted at Barking, having passed Stratford, can also rejoin the LTSR before and then continue to . This latter route is not currently used in the standard timetable, however at weekends there are two trains per hour to and from that call at Stratford and Liverpool Street.

From May 1985 to May 2007, the standard weekday service after 22:30 operated out of Liverpool Street rather than Fenchurch Street. Currently, this is only used during weekends, when some Basildon services are diverted into Liverpool Street, as well as during engineering works that prohibit access to Fenchurch Street.

====Former stations====

===Signalling schemes===
This section summarises the major re-signalling schemes on the LTS line from 1912.

====1935====
The LNER re-organised the approaches to Fenchurch Street and new signalling was introduced.

====1958====
In connection with electrification and the separation of the District line the following changes were made:

Crossovers between the Local and Through lines removed
Signalling on the Local Lines taken over by LT
Semaphore signalling replaced by colour light signalling

====1996====
Over the years the line had been used in an almost experimental fashion and contained a host of different signalling systems, such as geographical, WESTPAC and relay interlockings. In 1995 work began to replace everything from signals and point machines to whole junctions.The main contractor for the work was GEC Alsthom which provided a Mark 3 Solid State Interlocking (SSI) system, with SEMA providing the IECC element at Upminster that replaced all signal boxes on the whole line. Main line running signals mostly became four-aspect colour lights (replacing searchlight signals amongst others), all point machines were replaced with HW2000 machines and the whole line had a complete fibre optic network installed. All level crossings were renewed with automatic barriers to be CCTV-controlled by a designated workstation at Upminster.

The main line between East Ham and Shoeburyness was also bi-directionally signalled (with three-aspect signalling) along most parts, with the bi-directional section alternating from one track to the other between certain stations, to provide maximum flexibility for continuing operations should disruption occur.

The line was re-signalled over the Easter weekend of 1996 when all the signal boxes from Fenchurch Street to Shoeburyness (via Basildon) were switched out and control was transferred to Upminster IECC. This was later followed over the 1996 August bank holiday when Upminster took control from the remaining boxes on the Tilbury Loop.

== Proposed developments ==
===Beam Park station===
A new railway station, Beam Park railway station, is proposed at Beam Park, between Dagenham Dock and Rainham, near Marsh Way road and CEME Innovation Centre (between A13 and A1306).

===Tilbury Docks===
A company called Walsh are planning to build two new freight hubs at the port – a logistics terminal with aggregates processing plant and a rail-linked freight facility.
===Purfleet station===
There are plans to close and relocate Purfleet railway station slightly north as part of plans for thousands of homes in the area. A planning application for the new station was submitted in May 2023.

==Ownership and management summary==

The railway was initially jointly promoted by the Eastern Counties Railway and London and Blackwall Railway and was leased for 21 years to Peto, Brassey and Betts. The lease expired in 1875, leaving the LTSR to take over operation itself. The Midland Railway and LTSR jointly constructed the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway, which enabled through-running of trains between and the Tilbury docks from 1894 and Southend from 1895.

In 1912 the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway was vested in the Midland Railway following an Act of 7 August 1912, though Midland did not assume full control until 1 October 1920. Upon company grouping in 1923, the line became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. That organisation was nationalised into British Railways in 1948, the line becoming part of the London Midland Region, however, in 1949 the LTS line became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways.

In 1986 the route was transferred to the Network SouthEast sector of British Rail. During this period, it was known as Network SouthEast&#x27;s &quot;misery line&quot;.

On privatisation in 1996, ownership of the infrastructure passed to Railtrack and Prism Rail took over operations of the franchise, marketing the route as LTS Rail. LTS Rail rebranded as c2c in May 2000 and Prism Rail was bought by National Express in July that year. National Express sold c2c to the Italian operator Trenitalia in February 2017.

Infrastructure management passed from Railtrack to Network Rail in 2002.

==Shipping activity==

Until 1855, the ferry crossing between Tilbury and Gravesend in Kent was operated by sailing and rowing boats; however, in that year, steam driven vessels were introduced on the River Thames crossing. On formation of the LTSR, that operation became part of its activities.

Responsibility for the ferry operation was transferred to the Midland Railway Company and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1912 and 1923 respectively.

<text>Meir Bar-Ilan (; – ) was an orthodox rabbi, author, and religious Zionist activist, who served as leader of the Mizrachi movement in the United States and Mandatory Palestine. Bar-Ilan University, founded in 1955, was named in his honour.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Bar-Ilan was born Meir Berlin in 1880 to a Lithuanian Jewish family, the youngest son of Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin and his second wife Rayna Batya Miriam Berlin (). Bar-Ilan&#x27;s father was the head of the famous Volozhin Yeshiva in Lithuania. Bar-Ilan was also a descendant of Rabbi Meir Katzenellenbogen, the Maharam of Padua.

He studied at the Volozhin Yeshiva and, after his father&#x27;s death in 1894, at the traditional yeshivas of Telshe, Brisk and Novardok, where he learned with his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein. After gaining &quot;semicha&quot; in 1902 at the age of twenty-two, Bar-Ilan travelled to Germany to attend the University of Berlin. There, he became acquainted with a more modern form of Orthodox Judaism that had a more tolerant attitude to secular education and to political Zionism (although such attitudes were also present in the Lithuania of his youth). Bar-Ilan was deeply influenced by the local religious community and its philosophy of &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;.

===Mizrachi movement and &quot;Ha’Ivri&quot;===
In 1905 Bar-Ilan joined the Mizrachi movement, representing it at the Seventh Zionist Congress, at which he voted against the Uganda Proposal to create a temporary Jewish homeland in British East Africa, as suggested by Great Britain.

In 1911, he founded the Hebrew weekly newspaper &quot;Ha’Ivri&quot; in Berlin as a &quot;non-party paper dedicated to all the affairs of Israel, faithful in its spirit to our religious tradition and to our national renaissance.&quot; That same year, Bar-Ilan was appointed secretary of the world Mizrachi movement. In 1913 he came to the United States and developed local Mizrachi groups into a national organisation, chairing the first American Mizrachi convention, held in Cincinnati in May 1914.

Bar-Ilan settled in New York in 1914, becoming president of the American Mizrachi movement the following year, a position he held until 1928. In his absence &quot;Ha’Ivri&quot; ceased publication in April 1914, but was re-established under Bar-Ilan&#x27;s direction in New York in January 1916. Published until 1921, the paper&#x27;s contributors included such prominent writers as S. Y. Agnon, Joseph Opatoshu, Reuben Brainin, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, and Yehuda Leib Maimon. Bar-Ilan was also an active member of the Joint Distribution Committee during World War I, and served as vice president of the Central Relief Committee of New York City in 1916. He founded the Mizrachi Teachers Institute in 1917. From 1920 through 1922, Bar-Ilan briefly served as acting president for what is now Yeshiva University during the temporary absence of its then-president, Bernard Revel.

===Life in Mandate Palestine===
In 1923 he moved to Jerusalem. In Palestine, Bar-Ilan founded the daily newspaper &quot;Hatzofeh&quot; and initiated the &quot;Encyclopedia Talmudit&quot;, a Hebrew encyclopedia summarizing halachic topics in the Talmud, forty-two volumes of which have been published to date. Bar-Ilan also served on the board of directors of the Mizrachi Bank and, in 1925, became a member of the Board of Directors of the Jewish National Fund, devoted to financing the rebuilding of the Jewish homeland in the then-British Mandate of Palestine.

He was a vocal opponent of the 1937 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the 1939 British White Paper, and advocated civil disobedience and non-cooperation by the Jews with the British.

At the beginning of 1943, Bar-Ilan visited the United States to lobby the American government to rescue Jewish refugees and help establish a Jewish state. He secured meetings with leading politicians and foreign ambassadors, including Vice President Henry Wallace, Senator Robert Wagner, Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley, and House Minority Leader Joseph Martin.

==Scholarship==
Along with Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin, Bar-Ilan was the editor of the &quot;Talmudical Encyclopedia&quot; (), Volumes I (Jerusalem, 1946) and II (published posthumously in 1949). He also wrote articles on Talmudic subjects for various periodicals. Notable works of Bar-Ilan include:
* &quot;&quot; (; New York, 1934)
* &quot;Fun Volozhin biz Yerushalayim&quot; (; in Yiddish, New York, 1933; in Hebrew, Tel Aviv, 1939–40), autobiography in two volumes
* &quot;Bishvil ha-Techiah&quot; (Tel Aviv, 1940) 
* &quot;Raban shel Yisrael&quot; (; New York, 1943)

After 1948, his activities were scholastically oriented. He organized a committee of scholars to examine the legal problems of the new state in the light of Jewish law and founded an institute for the publication of a new complete edition of the Talmud.

==Legacy==
Bar-Ilan inspired the founding of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan by the American Mizrachi movement, named in his honour. The moshav Beit Meir is named in his honour, as are the Meir Forest in the Hebron Hills and Bar-Ilan Street in Jerusalem, as well as streets in several other Israeli cities.

<text>The black-faced cuckooshrike (Coracina novaehollandiae) is a common omnivorous passerine bird native to Australia and southern New Guinea. It has a protected status in Australia, under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1974.

They are widely distributed in almost any wooded habitat throughout the region, except in rainforests. But they can also occur in urban areas, and are a fairly common sight on power lines in Australian cities such as Sydney and Perth.

==Taxonomy==
The black-faced cuckooshrike was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus novaehollandiae&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;New Holland thrush&quot; that had been described in 1783 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Lathan had examined a specimen in the collection of the naturalist Joseph Banks that had come from Adventure Bay in southern Tasmania. Adventure Bay had been visited by Captain James Cook in January 1777 on his third voyage to the Pacific Ocean. A painting of the black-faced cuckooshrike by William Ellis that was made during this visit is in the collection of the Natural History Museum in London. In 1921 Gregory Mathews recognised that Gmelin&#x27;s &quot;Turdus novaehollandiae&quot; and Latham&#x27;s &quot;New Holland thrush&quot; corresponded to the black-faced cuckooshrike. It is now one of 22 species placed in the genus &quot;Coracina&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. n. subpallida&quot; Mathews, 1912 – central west Western Australia (central west Australia)
* &quot;C. n. melanops&quot; (Latham, 1801) – southwest, south, north, east Australia and central south coast of southeast New Guinea
* &quot;C. n. novaehollandiae&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Tasmania and Bass Strait Islands (southeast Australia)

The Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara know the species as &quot;julgira&quot;; they would clip their wings and keep them as pets.

==Description==
Adult birds have a prominent black face and throat, grey plumage, white underparts and a somewhat hooked bill. The size varies between 32 cm and 34 cm. They are slow-moving, inconspicuous birds, with a shrill, screaming call, sounding like &quot;creearck&quot;.

==Behaviour==
===Food and feeding===
The diet consists of insects, their larvae, caterpillars or other invertebrates. These may be caught in flight, or caught when searching through the foliage. In addition, some fruits and seeds are also eaten.

===Breeding===
Breeding season is chiefly from August to February each year. Both partners build the rather small nest. The fledglings leave the nest after about three weeks of hatching. They look like the adults, except the black facial mask is reduced to an eye stripe.

Outside the breeding season, they like to flock in groups of up to a hundred birds. Some may be partially migratory or they may remain in the same territory. Lack of significant differences between regional populations in Australia makes it difficult to determine where populations move in winter.

<doc id="640171" wikidata="Q218547" url="?curid=640171" title="The Sigismund Bell">
<text>The Sigismund Bell ( or colloquially ) is the largest of the five bells hanging in the Sigismund Tower of the Wawel Cathedral in the city of Kraków, Poland. It was cast in 1520 by Hans Beham and named after King Sigismund I the Old, who commissioned it. The bell weighs almost 13 tonnes (28 thousand pounds) and requires 12 bell-ringers to manually swing it. It tolls on special occasions, mostly religious and national holidays, and is regarded as one of Poland&#x27;s national symbols.

== Description ==
The body of the Sigismund Bell is cast in bronze and weighs 9,650 kg. Its diameter at the lip is 242 cm and its height is 241 cm. The wall of the body is from 7 to 21 cm thick. The crown of the bell is attached to a yoke made of oak wood and measuring 308 cm in length and 219 cm in height. Within the bell, suspended on a leather belt of up to 12 layers, attached to an iron supporting structure, is a Gothic clapper, weighing – together with the belt – 365 kg.

The body of the bell is decorated with inscriptions and images. Around the upper part of the waist runs a majuscule Renaissance Latin inscription indicating the bell&#x27;s donor and dedicating it to God:
Deo Opt Max ac Virgini Deiparae sanctisque patronis suis divus Sigismundus Poloniae Rex campanam hanc dignam animi operumque ac gestorum suorum magnitudine fieri fecit anno salutis MDXX


The inscription translates as follows: &quot;To the greatest and best God, and to the Virgin Mother of God, the illustrious King Sigismund of Poland had this bell cast to be worthy of the greatness of his mind and deeds in the year of salvation 1520.&quot; Below the inscription there are two portal-shaped plaques with images of saints. The one below the date &quot;MDXX&quot; (1520 in Roman numerals) is a likeness of Saint Sigismund, patron saint of the bell and of the king who commissioned it, dressed in royal vestments and insignia as a king of Burgundy.

On the opposite side of the bell, there is a corresponding image of Saint Stanislaus wearing episcopal robes and holding a crosier as a bishop of Kraków. Stanislaus is venerated as a patron saint of the Wawel Cathedral and, by extension, of Kraków and all Poland. Both images are placed between heraldic shields bearing the coats of arms of the two nations of Sigismund I&#x27;s realm – the White Eagle of the Kingdom of Poland on the left, and the Knight of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on the right.

Below each of these images, there is the name of the bell&#x27;s caster in German (below Saint Sigismund) or Latin (below Saint Stanislaus), as well as his house mark. Both inscriptions, quoted below, translate as &quot;Hans Beham of Nuremberg&quot;.

The Sigismund Bell was commissioned for the Wawel Cathedral by Sigismund I, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was cast by Hans Behem (or Beham) of Nuremberg in 1520. Behem set up a special foundry near Kraków&#x27;s Florian Gate where he is said to have used scrap metal taken from the cannons captured by Polish–Lithuanian forces from the Muscovite army in the Battle of Orsha in 1514. A similar and clearly incorrect legend identifies the source of metal as the battle of Obertyn (1531). The bell was installed in the Sigismund Tower and rung for the first time on 13 July 1521.

Apart from major religious and national holidays, the bell was rung on some of the most significant moments in the history of Poland, including the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, on the eve of Poland&#x27;s entry into the European Union on 30 April 2004, on the occasion of each visit by Pope John Paul II, and after the plane crash which killed President Lech Kaczyński and dozens of other high-ranking officials on 10 April 2010. It also tolled during funerals or reburials of several great Poles, such as Adam Mickiewicz (1900), Marshal Józef Piłsudski (1935), General Władysław Sikorski (1993), Pope John Paul II (2005), and Lech Kaczyński with his wife (2010). It rang defiantly on Polish national holidays in the times of partitions (1795–1918) and under the communist regime (1945–1989), thus reinforcing its role as a national symbol.

Hans Frank, the governor-general of the General Government, had the Sigismund Bell rung in 1940 to celebrate the German victory over France. After the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in 1953, Poland&#x27;s communist authorities demanded that the bell be rung as a sign of mourning. When the cathedral&#x27;s bell-ringers refused, soldiers were ordered to ring the bell instead, or – depending on the source – it was rung by a group of Communist activists.

On at least one occasion, the bell was also rung as a juvenile prank. According to several memoirists, in 1882, Stanisław Estreicher, Józef Mehoffer, Henryk Opieński, and Stanisław Wyspiański – then in their high school years – sneaked onto the Sigismund tower and managed to toll the bell. When Wyspiański was caught, the bishop wished him that Sigismund ring at his funeral – which actually happened in 1907. An experiment conducted in 2011 to verify the plausibility of this anecdote showed that four teenagers would have been unable to toll the bell properly, but they could have swung the clapper enough to make a ringing sound.

The original iron clapper made about 12 million strokes during the 479 years of its history. During the 19th century, it broke and underwent repairs in 1859, 1865, and 1876. After it broke again on 25 December 2000, it was replaced by a new one – paid for and cast by Kraków metallurgic companies – on 14 April 2001.

===Present day===
The Sigismund Bell rings in important moments for Krakow and Poland, in recent years, among others:

*March 25, 2020 - during prayer for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic
*July 13, 2021 - on the occasion of his own 500th anniversary, Zygmunt called twice: around 5:15 p.m. and at 9:00 p.m.
*September 2, 2021 - after the death of the rector of the Wawel Cathedral, Fr. Zdzisław Sochacki.
*March 6, 2022 - the bell rang in support for the fighting Ukraine, attacked on February 24, 2022 by Russia
*December 31, 2022 - after the death of Benedict XVI
*January 5, 2023 - during the funeral of Benedict XVI in the Vatican

== Bell-ringers ==
The Sigismund Bell is operated manually by pulling ropes attached to its yoke. It takes 12 men, six on either side, to swing the bell. 
The task requires strength, coordination and caution. While swinging, the bell often pulls the ringers up from the floor; in the interwar period, one ringer was accidentally killed when the bell pushed him out of a window. In 1888, the cathedral chapter specified the duration of ringing at eight minutes, but the bell may toll for up to 20 minutes in certain cases, such as during a procession.

In the 16th century, the bell was rung by peasants from the village of Świątniki Górne, who also performed other chores in the cathedral. During the following several centuries, it was operated by members of the carpenters&#x27; guild. Since the mid-20th century, the privilege of ringing the bell has belonged to about 30 members of the Fraternity of Wawel Bell-Ringers (&quot;Bractwo Dzwonników na Wawelu&quot;). Bell-ringers are mostly members of Kraków intelligentsia and membership is often passed from father to son. , there has been only one female bell-ringer.

A person who has participated in the ringing of the Sigismund Bell at least 50 times over the course of at least three years receives a badge with an image of the bell and the inscription: &quot;Dzwonnik Zygmunta&quot; (&quot;Sigismund Bell-Ringer&quot;). Honorary badges are occasionally awarded to people who never actually rang the bell. A unique, golden honorary badge was given to Pope John Paul II.

== Ringing dates ==
The bell regularly tolls on major Catholic holidays, Polish national holidays, and feast days of the patron saints of the bell, the cathedral, Kraków or all Poland. It also tolls on other special occasions at the discretion of the archbishop of Kraków.

<text>Avgolemono ( or literally egg–lemon) is a family of sauces and soups made with egg yolk and lemon juice mixed with broth, heated until they thicken.

Avgolemono can be used to thicken soups and stews. Yuvarlakia is a Greek meatball soup made with rice and meat meatballs that are cooked in liquid. Avgolemono is added to the soup to thicken it. Magiritsa soup is a Greek avgolemono soup of lamb offal served to break the fast of Great Lent.

As a soup, avgolemono usually starts with chicken broth, though meat (usually lamb), fish, or vegetable broths are also used. Typically, rice, orzo, pastina, or tapioca are cooked in the broth before the mixture of eggs and lemon is added. Its consistency varies from near-stew to near-broth. It is often served with pieces of the meat and vegetables reserved from the broth. 

The soup is usually made with whole eggs, but sometimes with just yolks. The whites may be beaten into a foam separately before mixing with the yolks and lemon juice, or whole eggs may be beaten with the lemon juice.

The starch of the pasta or rice contributes to stabilizing the emulsion.

== Similar foods ==
Similar foods are found in Greek, Arab, Sephardic Jewish, Turkish, Balkan and Jewish-Italian cuisine.

In Sephardic Jewish cuisine, it is called &quot;agristada&quot; (:he:אגריסטדה) or &quot;salsa blanco&quot;, and in Jewish-Italian, &quot;bagna brusca&quot;, &quot;brodettato&quot;, or &quot;brodo brusco&quot;. In Arabic, it is called &quot;tarbiya&quot; or &quot;beida bi-lemoune&quot; &#x27;egg with lemon&#x27;; and in Turkish &quot;terbiye&quot;. It is also widely used in Balkan cuisine.

Although often considered a Greek dish, &quot;avgolemono&quot; is originally Sephardic Jewish: &quot;agristada&quot; has been described by Claudia Roden as the &quot;cornerstone of Sephardic cooking.&quot; 

&quot;Agristada&quot; was made by Jews in Iberia before the expulsion from Spain with verjuice, pomegranate juice, or bitter orange juice, but not vinegar. In later periods, lemon became the standard acidic ingredient.

For some Sephardic Jews, this soup (also called &quot;sopa de huevo y limón&quot;) is a traditional way to break the Yom Kippur fast.

As a sauce, it is used for warm dolma, for vegetables like artichokes, and roast meats. According to Joyce Goldstein, the dish &quot;terbiyeli köfte&quot; is made by frying meatballs until they are cooked through, then preparing a pan sauce by deglazing the pan and using the cooking juices to temper the avgolemono, which is served over the meatballs. 

In some Middle Eastern cuisines, it is used as a sauce for chicken or fish. Among Italian Jews, it is served as a sauce for pasta or meat.

<text>Victory at Sea is a documentary television series about warfare in general during World War II, and naval warfare in particular, as well as the use of industry in warfare. It was broadcast by NBC in the United States during 1952–53. It was condensed into a film released in 1954. Excerpts from the music soundtrack, by Richard Rodgers and Robert Russell Bennett, were re-recorded for record albums. The original TV broadcasts comprised 26 half-hour segments—Sunday afternoons at 3:00 p.m. (EST) in most markets—starting on October 26, 1952 and ending on May 3, 1953. The series won an Emmy award in 1954 as &quot;best public affairs program&quot; and played an important part in establishing historic &quot;compilation&quot; documentaries as a television genre.

==History==
The project was conceived by Henry Salomon, who, while a U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander during World War II, was a research assistant to historian Samuel Eliot Morison. Morison was then writing the 15-volume &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II&quot;. Salomon learned of the large amounts of film that the opposing navies had compiled. Salomon left the Navy in 1948 and eventually discussed his idea of a documentary series with one of his Phillips Academy and Harvard classmates, Robert Sarnoff, a rising executive at NBC television and the son of David Sarnoff, the chairman of RCA (then the owner of NBC). It was Robert Sarnoff who championed Salomon&#x27;s proposal, won its approval and saw it through to completion.

NBC approved the project in 1951, with Salomon as producer and a budget of $500,000 (large for that era). His team, composed largely of newsreel veterans, searched naval archives around the world and received cooperation from the U.S. Navy, which recognized the publicity value. Salomon&#x27;s team compiled of film, which was edited to about for broadcast.

After the first run, NBC syndicated it to local stations, where it proved successful financially through the mid-1960s. NBC also marketed the series overseas; by 1964, it had been broadcast in forty foreign markets. NBC created a feature-length (89-minute) motion picture condensation. The feature-length version was narrated by Alexander Scourby who replaced Leonard Graves, the narrator of the 26-part series. NBC made a distribution deal with United Artists and the film debuted in mid-1954. NBC also prepared another, 79-minute, condensation for broadcast and it debuted on 29 December 1960 in a 90-minute evening slot as part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Project Twenty&quot; (&quot;Project XX&quot;) series, which itself was established in 1955 as an offshoot of original &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; production unit.

==Awards==
&quot;Victory at Sea&quot; won many honors, including:
* a 1953 Emmy nomination for Best Public Affairs Program
* a 1954 Emmy award for Best Public Affairs Program
* a 1953 Peabody award.
* the Freedoms Foundation&#x27;s George Washington Medal.

==Music==
Salomon also signed Richard Rodgers, fresh off several successful Broadway musicals, to compose the musical score. Rodgers contributed 12 &quot;themes&quot;—short piano compositions a minute or two in length; these may be examined in the Rodgers Collection at the Library of Congress. Robert Russell Bennett did the orchestrating, transforming Rodgers&#x27;s themes for a variety of moods, and composing much more original material than Rodgers, as may be observed in Bennett&#x27;s holograph scores, archived with his papers at Northwestern University and microfilmed at the Library of Congress. Episode No. 18, for example, is entirely of Bennett&#x27;s creation, and uses none of Rodgers&#x27;s twelve themes. Bennett nonetheless received credit only for arranging the score and conducting NBC Symphony Orchestra members on the soundtrack recording sessions, and many writers still refer erroneously to &quot;Rodgers&#x27;s thirteen-hour score&quot;. In 1954, Rodgers recorded the VAS &quot;Symphonic Scenario&quot; medley (scored by Bennett) with the New York Philharmonic for Columbia Records, but it was Bennett who conducted the much more familiar RCA Victor recordings—the first (1953) with NBC Symphony Orchestra musicians who played for the soundtrack sessions, and later with members of the Symphony of the Air, an orchestra created in the autumn of 1954 from former NBC Symphony members, identified on the albums as the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra.

RCA has released and reissued the Rodgers-Bennett musical score several times on LP and CD. The listing below is based on the 1992 RCA remastered recordings titled &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; (13 tracks) and &quot;More Victory at Sea&quot; (11 tracks). Selections from &quot;More Victory at Sea&quot; are marked by an asterisk (*). Note that the &quot;More Victory at Sea&quot; album also includes &quot;Special Effect Battle Sounds&quot; as part of many of the tracks.

The movements and approximate timings in the RCA Victor Symphony performance are as follows:

# The Song of the High Seas – 5:02
# The Pacific Boils Over – 5:43
# Fire on the Waters – 5:58
# Guadalcanal March – 3:07
# Pelelieu* – 3:37

The score was a favorite of U.S. President Richard Nixon, who was a Navy veteran himself, and part of it was played at his funeral. Additionally, Volume 1 of the score won &quot;Best Engineering Contribution - Classical Recording&quot; at the 2nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1960. The category has since been renamed &quot;Best Engineered Album, Classical.&quot;

Rodgers&#x27;s &quot;Beneath the Southern Cross&quot; theme was given words by Oscar Hammerstein, titled &quot;No Other Love&quot;, and put into their 1953 musical, &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;. The May 1953 recording by RCA Victor recording artist Perry Como became a &quot;Number One&quot; hit on the pop charts later that year.

<text>John Sedgwick (September 13, 1813 – May 9, 1864) was an American military officer who served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War.

He was wounded three times at the Battle of Antietam while leading his division in an unsuccessful assault against Confederate forces, causing him to miss the Battle of Fredericksburg. Under his command, the VI Corps played an important role in the Chancellorsville Campaign by engaging Confederate troops at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Salem Church. His corps was the last to arrive at the Battle of Gettysburg and thus did not see much action. Sedgwick was killed by a sharpshooter at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 9, 1864, making him and Major Generals James B. McPherson, Joseph K. Mansfield, and John F. Reynolds the highest-ranking Union officers to be killed in the war. He is remembered for an ironic remark among his last words: &quot;They couldn&#x27;t hit an elephant at this distance.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Sedgwick was born in the Litchfield Hills town of Cornwall, Connecticut. He was named after his grandfather, John Sedgwick (brother of Theodore Sedgwick), who was Lieutenant Colonel of the 14th Regiment of Connecticut Militia during the American Revolutionary War. He attended Sharon Academy for 2 years and Cheshire Academy in 1830–31. After teaching for two years, he attended the United States Military Academy, graduated in 1837 ranked 24th of 50, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army&#x27;s artillery branch. He fought in the Seminole Wars and received two brevet promotions in the Mexican–American War, to captain for Contreras and Churubusco, and to major for Chapultepec. After returning from Mexico, he was promoted to the permanent rank of captain in 1849 and replaced James Duncan as commander of Battery A, 2nd U.S. Artillery. In March 1855, Sedgwick accepted a transfer promotion to the rank of major with the United States Cavalry. He served in Kansas, in the Utah War, and in the Indian Wars, participating during 1857 in a punitive expedition against the Cheyenne.

In the summer and fall of 1860, Sedgwick commanded an expedition to establish a new fort on the Platte River in what is now Colorado. This was a remote location with no railroads, and all supplies having to be carried long distances by riverboat, wagon train or horseback. Even though many of these supplies failed to arrive, Sedgwick still managed to erect comfortable stone buildings for his men before the cold weather set in.

== American Civil War ==

At the start of the American Civil War, Sedgwick was serving as a colonel and assistant inspector general of the Military Department of Washington. He missed the early action of the war at the First Battle of Bull Run, recovering from cholera. Promoted to brigadier general on August 31, 1861, he commanded the 2nd brigade of Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman&#x27;s division in the Army of the Potomac, then his own division, which was designated the 2nd division of the II Corps for the Peninsula Campaign. In Virginia, he fought at Yorktown and Seven Pines. During the Seven Days Battles, Sedgwick&#x27;s division fought at Savage&#x27;s Station and Glendale, being wounded in the latter engagement. After the Seven Days Battles, he was promoted to major general. The II Corps and Sedgwick&#x27;s division were not involved in the Northern Virginia Campaign.
In the Battle of Antietam, II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner impulsively sent Sedgwick&#x27;s division in a mass assault without proper reconnaissance. His division was engaged by Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson from three sides, was routed, and fell back with barely half the men it had started with. Sedgwick himself was shot three times, in the wrist, leg, and shoulder, and was out of action until after the Battle of Fredericksburg.

From December 26, 1862, he briefly led the II Corps and the IX Corps, and then finally the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac, which he commanded until his death in 1864. During the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, his corps faced Fredericksburg in an initial holding action while Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker&#x27;s other four corps maneuvered against Robert E. Lee&#x27;s left flank (10 miles east at Chancellorsville). Sedgwick was slow to take action, but eventually crossed the Rappahannock River and assaulted Maj. Gen. Jubal Early&#x27;s small force on Marye&#x27;s Heights on May 3 during the Second Battle of Fredericksburg. Moving west slowly to join forces with Hooker and trap Lee between the halves of the army, he was stopped by elements of Lee&#x27;s Second Corps (under Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, following the wounding of Jackson) at the Battle of Salem Church, forcing his eventual retreat back over the Rappahannock.
At the Battle of Gettysburg, his corps arrived late on July 2, and as a result only a few units were able to take part in the final Union counterattacks in the Wheatfield. It was not kept together as a unit during the second and third days of the battle, its brigades scattered around to plug holes in the line. While much of Sedgwick&#x27;s VI Corps was held in reserve at Gettysburg, it performed exceptionally at the Second Battle of Rappahannock Station in November, capturing four field pieces, eight stands of enemy colors and 1,700 prisoners.

Prior to the start of the Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864, George Meade reorganized the Army of the Potomac and dropped several underperforming generals. Sedgwick narrowly missed the chopping block, being that he was unpopular with Secretary of War Edwin Stanton for being a vocal admirer of departed Army of the Potomac commander George McClellan and for having shown insufficient enthusiasm for abolitionism and the Radical Republican platform. Sedgwick had also made enemies among the Radical Republicans by criticizing General Benjamin Butler, one of their favorites. Meade, realizing this, proposed reassigning Sedgwick to command in the Shenandoah Valley. Sedgwick himself acknowledged that he was war-weary by this point and would have welcomed reassignment to a post where not much fighting was expected. In a letter to his sister, he said that he could gladly leave the army without regret and wished to come home to New England. In the end however, General Franz Sigel got the Shenandoah Valley command, which ended up being a much more active theater in 1864 than anyone expected, and Sedgwick remained in command of the VI Corps.

In the Overland Campaign, the VI Corps was on the Union right at the Battle of the Wilderness and defended against assaults by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s Second Corps.

=== Death ===

Sedgwick died at the beginning of the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, on May 9, 1864. His corps was probing skirmish lines ahead of the left flank of Confederate defenses and he was directing artillery placements. Confederate sharpshooters were about away, and their shots caused members of his staff, infantrymen from the 87th Pennsylvania and 14th New Jersey, and artillerymen from the 1st Massachusetts, to duck for cover. Sedgwick strode around in the open and was quoted as saying, &quot;What? Men dodging this way for single bullets? What will you do when they open fire along the whole line?&quot; Although ashamed, his men continued to flinch and he said, &quot;Why are you dodging like this? They couldn&#x27;t hit an elephant at this distance.&quot; 

Reports that he never finished the sentence are apocryphal, although the line was among his last words. He was shot by a Whitworth rifle bullet moments later under the left eye and mortally wounded. His chief of staff Martin T. McMahon said that the sharpshooters&#x27; bullets were flying all around, making whistling noises, and &quot;The same shrill whistle closing with a dull, heavy stroke interrupted me, and I remember distinctly that I commenced to say &#x27;General, they are firing explosive bullets.&#x27; when his face turned slowly to me, and blood spurting from his left cheek under the eye in a steady stream, brought to me the first knowledge of our great disaster. He fell in my direction and I was so close to him that my effort to support him failed, and I went to the ground with him.&quot; Corps medical personnel were immediately summoned, but Sedgwick never regained consciousness and continued to bleed out for some time, until his hair was soaked with blood.

Sedgwick was the highest-ranking general officer in the US Volunteers to be killed in the war. Although Major General James B. McPherson was in command of an army at the time of his death and Sedgwick of a corps, Sedgwick had the most senior rank by date of all major generals killed. However, McPherson was a brigadier general in the Regular Army and outranked Sedgwick, who was a colonel. Upon hearing of his death, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, flabbergasted by the news, repeatedly asked, &quot;Is he really dead?&quot;

== Legacy ==

Sedgwick&#x27;s reputation was that of a solid, dependable, but relatively unaggressive general. He was well-liked by his soldiers, who referred to him affectionately as &quot;Uncle John&quot;. His death was met by universal sorrow; even Robert E. Lee expressed his sadness over the fate of an old friend. George G. Meade wept at the news. Meade had recently quarreled with Sedgwick for being over-reliant on fellow corps commander Gouverneur Warren for advice, and said of him &quot;I wish we could have parted on better terms.&quot; Ulysses S. Grant characterized Sedgwick as one who &quot;was never at fault when serious work was to be done&quot; and he told his staff that the loss for him was worse than that of an entire division.

Sedgwick is buried near his birthplace of Cornwall Hollow, Connecticut. An equestrian statue honors him and the VI Corps at Gettysburg National Military Park.

There is a monument of General Sedgwick at West Point. Academy legend has it that a cadet who spins the rowels of the spurs on the boots of the statue at midnight while wearing full parade dress gray over white uniform under arms will have good luck on his or her final exam.

The following were named in his honor:
* Sedgwick, Colorado
* Sedgwick County, Colorado
* Sedgwick, Kansas
* Sedgwick County, Kansas
* Fort Sedgwick was one of the forts of the Union siege line in the Siege of Petersburg 1864–65.
* Camp Rankin was renamed Fort Sedgwick in 1865, near Julesburg, Colorado.

Sedgwick Avenue, a major street in the Bronx, New York City, is named after him. An east–west street in Washington, D.C., near American University, is also named in his honor, as is another on Chicago&#x27;s near north side, with a CTA station named after the street. Grand Army of the Republic Post #4 in Keene, New Hampshire; Post #12 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Post #17 in Santa Ana, California; and Post #37 in York, Pennsylvania, are all named after him. A junior high school, John Sedgwick Middle School &quot;Home of the Generals&quot;, in Port Orchard, Washington, was named after him.

Farley, his home and headquarters at the time of the Battle of Brandy Station, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

<doc id="640187" wikidata="Q200294" url="?curid=640187" title="United Arab Emirates dirham">
<text>The United Arab Emirates Dirham (; , abbreviation: د.إ in Arabic, Dh (singular) and Dhs (plural) or DH in Latin; ISO code: AED is the official currency of the United Arab Emirates. The dirham is subdivided into 100 . It is pegged to the United States Dollar at a constant exchange rate of approximately 3.67 AED to 1 USD.

== History ==
The name &quot;dirham&quot; is a loan from the Greek δραχμή (drakhmé). Due to centuries of trade and usage of the currency, &quot;dirham&quot; survived through the Ottoman Empire.

Before 1966, all the emirates that now form the UAE used the Gulf rupee, which was pegged at parity to the Indian rupee. On 6 June 1966, India decided to devalue the Gulf rupee against the Indian rupee. Not accepting the devaluation, several of the states still using the Gulf rupee adopted their own or other currencies. All the Trucial States except Abu Dhabi adopted the Qatar and Dubai riyal, which was equal to the Gulf rupee prior to the devaluation. These emirates briefly adopted the Saudi riyal during the transition from the Gulf rupee to the Qatar and Dubai riyal. Abu Dhabi used the Bahraini dinar, at a rate of 10 Gulf rupees = 1 dinar. In 1973, the UAE adopted the UAE dirham as its currency. Abu Dhabi adopted the UAE dirham in place of the Bahraini dinar, at 1 dinar = 10 dirhams, while in the other emirates, the Qatar and Dubai riyal were exchanged at par.

== Coins ==
In 1973, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 fils and 1 dirham. The 1, 5, and 10 fils are struck in bronze, with the higher denominations in cupro-nickel. The fils coins were the same size and composition as the corresponding Qatar and Dubai dirham coins. In 1995, the 5 fils, 10 fils, 50 fils, and 1 dirham coins were reduced in size, with the new 50 fils being curve-equilateral-heptagonal shaped.

The value and numbers on the coins are written in Eastern Arabic numerals and the text is in Arabic. The 1, 5, and 10 fils coins are rarely used in everyday life, The Central Bank of the UAE continues to produce 1,5 and 10 fills coins. However, these coins are primarily minted for collectors and commemorative purposes rather than for everyday circulation.So all amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest multiples of 25 fils. The 1 fils coin is a rarity and does not circulate significantly. In making a change there is a risk of confusing the old 50 fils coin for the modern 1 dirham coin because the coins are almost the same size.

Since 1976 the Currency Board of the United Arab Emirates has minted several commemorative coins celebrating different events and rulers of the United Arab Emirates. For details, see Commemorative coins of the United Arab Emirates dirham.
=== Issues with fraud ===
By August 2006 it became publicly known that the Philippine one peso coin is the same size as one dirham. As 1 peso is only worth 8 fils, this has led to vending machine fraud in the UAE. Pakistan&#x27;s 5 rupee coin, the Omani 50 Baisa coin and the Moroccan 1 dirham are also the same sizes as the Emirati one dirham coin. Although 1 mm thinner, one dirham coin has also been found in ten-cent coin rolls in Australia. A falcon watermark is present on all dirham notes to prevent fraud.
== Banknotes ==
On 20 May 1973, the UAE Currency Board introduced notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 dirhams; a Dhs 1,000 note was issued on 3 January 1976. A second series of note was introduced in 1982 which omitted the Dh 1 and Dhs 1,000 notes. Dhs 500 notes were introduced in 1983, followed by Dhs 200 in 1989. Dhs 1,000 notes were reintroduced in 2000. Banknotes are currently available in denominations of Dhs 5 (brown), Dhs 10 (green), Dhs 20 (light blue), Dhs 50 (purple), Dhs 100 (pink), Dhs 200 (green/brown), Dhs 500 (navy blue) and Dhs 1,000 (greenish blue).

The obverse texts are written in Arabic with numbers in Eastern Arabic numerals; the reverse texts are in English with numbers in Arabic numerals. The 200 dirham denomination is scarce as it was only produced in 1989; any circulating today comes from bank stocks. The 200 dirham denomination has since been reissued and is now in circulation since late May 2008 – it has been reissued in a different colour; Yellow/Brown to replace the older Green/Brown.

On 22 March 2008, The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates released a Dhs 50 note. The security thread was a 3-mm wide, colour-shifting windowed security thread with demetalized UAE 50, and it bore the new coat of arms. On 7 December 2021, a redesigned polymer Dhs 50 note was released to commemorate the golden jubilee of the country on 2 December 2021, making it the UAE&#x27;s first polymer banknote. Additional new polymer banknotes of Dhs 5 and Dhs 10 were introduced on 21 April 2022, with the Dhs 1000 released in the first half of 2023, and the Dhs 500 note reportedly introduced on 30 November 2023.

===Second issue===

===Third issue===
== Exchange rates ==
On January 28, 1978, the dirham was officially pegged to the IMF&#x27;s special drawing rights (SDRs). In practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar for most of the time. Since November 1997, the dirham has been pegged to the US dollar at a rate of US$1 = Dhs 3.6725, which translates to approximately Dh 1 = US$0.272294.

<doc id="640189" wikidata="Q948738" url="?curid=640189" title="James Craig (barque)">
<text>James Craig is a three-masted, 19th century iron-hulled barque restored and sailed by the Sydney Heritage Fleet, Sydney, Australia. She is one of only four pre-20th century barques in the world that still go regularly to sea.

==History==
Built in 1874 in Sunderland, England, by Bartram, Haswell, &amp; Co., she was originally named &quot;Clan Macleod&quot;. Characterized by her biographer Jeff Toghill as a typical &quot;workhorse barque,&quot; she was intended to be operated as economically as possible while carrying general cargo worldwide - coal, salt, grain and cotton goods. In her world travels she rounded Cape Horn twenty-three times in the twenty-six years to 1900. In 1900 she was acquired by Mr J J Craig, renamed &quot;James Craig&quot; in 1905 and began to operate between ports in New Zealand and Australia. She made thirty-five voyages on the trans-Tasman run, to 1911.

Like many other sailing ships of her modest size, she fell victim to the advance of steamships in the first decade of the twentieth century and in 1911 she was converted to a storage hulk in Port Moresby. However, with the world-wide shortage of shipping caused by the First World War, she was re-rigged and refitted for trade in the Pacific in 1918. The reprieve for sailing ships was short-lived. With the exception of the grain trade, sailing ships were soon unable to compete with cargo-carrying steamships. In 1925 she was laid up again, then used as a hulk, until eventually being abandoned at Recherche Bay in Tasmania.To avoid her drifting and becoming a navigational hazard, a large hole was blown in her stern.

==Restoration==
Part of the inspiration for preserving &quot;James Craig &quot; has been credited to Karl Kortum, then director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum who had also been involved in encouraging Australians to preserve the similar sized barque Polly Woodside in Melbourne in 1962. Restoration of &quot;James Craig&quot; began in 1972, when volunteers from the Lady Hopetoun and Port Jackson Marine Steam Museum (now the Sydney Heritage Fleet) refloated her and towed her to Hobart for initial repairs. Brought back to Sydney under tow in 1981, her hull was placed on a submersible pontoon to allow work on the hull restoration to proceed. Over the next twenty-five years, the vessel was restored. Most of the hull was replaced, being repaired by both paid craftspeople and volunteers. The ship was relaunched in 1997, and restoration work was completed in 2001.

==Current situation==

&quot;James Craig&quot; is currently berthed at Wharf 7 in Darling Harbour, near the Australian National Maritime Museum. She is open to the public, and takes passengers out sailing on Sydney Harbour and beyond. She is crewed by volunteers from the Sydney Heritage Fleet. Maintenance is by paid staff, contractors and volunteers. The cost of maintaining her is over $1 million a year; the ship relies on income generated from visitors, charters, events and regular day sails with up to 80 passengers.

The ship has made historic return voyages to Hobart (2005, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2025) and to Port Philip (Melbourne and Williamstown) in 2006, 2008 and 2020. The voyages to Hobart coincide with the Wooden Boat Festival, one of the largest in the world.

In October 2013 &quot;James Craig&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney, Australia.

==Historical value==
&quot;James Craig&quot; is of exceptional historical value in that she is one of only four 19th century barques in the world that still go regularly to sea. In 2003 the World Ship Trust awarded the James Craig a Maritime Heritage Award for authentic restoration.
She is a working link to a time when such ships carried the bulk of global commerce in their holds. Thousands of similar ships plied the oceans in the 19th and early 20th centuries linking the old world, the new world, Asia and Oceania. She is sailed in the traditional 19th Century manner, mostly by volunteers. Her running rigging consists of 140 lines secured to belaying pins and spider bands. She achieved 11.3 knots on a return voyage from Melbourne on 9 February 2006.

== Engineering heritage award ==
&quot;James Craig&quot; received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

<text>An Act to amend the Criminal Code (hate propaganda), (, also known as &quot;Bill C-250&quot; during the second and third sessions of the 37th Canadian parliament) is an Act of the Parliament of Canada to amend the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. It added penalties for publicly inciting hatred against or encouraging the genocide of people on the basis of sexual orientation and added a defence for the expression of good-faith opinions based on religious texts. It originated in a Private Member&#x27;s Bill introduced by Svend Robinson, a member of the opposition.

==Content==
Prior to this amendment, the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; prohibited the promotion of genocide and the public incitement of hatred against groups identifiable by colour, race, religion, and ethnic origin. The &quot;Act&quot; expanded coverage of these existing provisions to include groups identifiable on the basis of sexual orientation. The &quot;Act&quot; also expanded one of the defences available to persons charged with the incitement of hatred, allowing for the expression of good-faith opinions based on religious texts, in addition to the preexisting defence allowing the good-faith expression of opinions on religious subjects.

As with all Canadian legislation, this act has equal force in French in which it is called &quot;La Loi modifiant le Code criminel (propagande haineuse)&quot;.

==Religious freedom concerns==
Critics of the bill claimed that it would prohibit reciting various scripture condemning homosexuality, while supporters pointed out that the bill added an explicit defence against any charge of incitement of hatred for opinions expressed in good faith based on religious texts. Critics of the law however, have expressed concern the courts will abrogate the religious loophole because &quot;good faith&quot; is not clearly defined.

==Legislative history==
C-250 was first introduced in 2001 into the 37th Parliament, 1st Session as Bill C-415 by New Democratic MP Svend Robinson. Following the end of that session, the bill was reintroduced as C-250 in the 37th Parliament, 2nd Session. It passed the House of Commons on September 17, 2003, but was not passed by the Senate before the end of the session. The bill was reintroduced in the 37th Parliament, 3rd Session, passing both the Senate on April 28, 2004. Royal Assent was granted on April 29, 2004.

<doc id="640220" wikidata="Q7493167" url="?curid=640220" title="Sheila Watson (writer)">
<text>Sheila Martin Watson (24 October 1909 – 1 February 1998) was a Canadian novelist, critic and teacher. She &quot;is best known for her modernist novel, &quot;The Double Hook&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; declares that: &quot;Publication of Watson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Double Hook&quot; (1959) marks the start of contemporary writing in Canada.&quot;

== Life ==
She was born Sheila Martin Doherty at New Westminster, British Columbia. She grew up on the grounds of the provincial mental hospital where her father, Dr. Charles Edward Doherty, was the superintendent until his death in 1922.

After studying at Vancouver&#x27;s Convent of the Sacred Heart, Sheila Doherty finished her university studies at the University of British Columbia, where she received her B.A. in 1931 and M.A. in 1933. She then worked as an elementary and high school teacher throughout British Columbia – including two years in Dog Creek (1935–1937), which served as a basis for her second novel, &quot;Deep Hollow Creek.&quot; She married Canadian poet Wilfred Watson in 1941.

Sheila Watson taught at Moulton Ladies College in Toronto between 1946 and 1948. From 1948 to 1950 she was a sessional lecturer at the University of British Columbia.

Watson wrote &quot;The Double Hook&quot; between 1952 and 1954 in Calgary and revised it during a year-long stay in Paris, from 1955 to 1956.
She was unable to find a publisher. &quot;T.S. Eliot at Faber &amp; Faber, C. Day Lewis at Chatto &amp; Windus, and Rupert Hart-Davis all turned it down.&quot;

In 1957 Watson began doctoral studies at the University of Toronto, writing her thesis on Wyndham Lewis under the direction of Marshall McLuhan. Unusually, she was older than her PhD advisor by two years, her birth year being 1909 and his being 1911. Her doctoral dissertation, &quot;Wyndham Lewis and Expressionism&quot; was finally completed in 1965. By then, though, Watson was already well known in Canadian academe.

In 1959 &quot;The Double Hook&quot; was published, and instantly recognized as a modern classic. &quot;All 3,000 copies of the initial print run were sold. Supporters such as ... McLuhan, as well as Yale formalist Cleanth Brooks, saw it as a literary landmark ushering the Canadian novel out of its regional confines. Professor Fred Salter ... called it &#x27;the most brilliant piece of fiction ever written in Canada&#x27;.&quot;

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation approached Watson to option the film rights to &quot;The Double Hook.&quot; However, because they would not give her veto rights over the script, she turned them down.

In 1961, Watson was hired as a professor of English at the University of Alberta. &quot;In Edmonton the Watsons became part of an active circle of writers and established the literary magazine,&quot;The White Pelican&quot; in 1970 along with Douglas Barbour, Stephen Scobie, John Orrell, Dorothy Livesay, and artist Norman Yates.&quot; Watson remained the founding editor of the &quot;White Pelican&quot; for its brief existence (1971–1975). White Pelican Publications published &quot;Lions at her Face,&quot; the first book by Miriam Mandel, which won the Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1973.

In 1984 Watson edited the &quot;Collected Poems of Miriam Mandel.&quot;
Watson retired in 1975. In 1976, she and her husband moved to Nanaimo, where they died in 1998.

== Writing ==
Watson is best known for her modernist novel The Double Hook (1959), which is considered &quot;a seminal work in the development of contemporary Canadian literature.&quot; &quot;&quot;The Double Hook&quot; presents in concise, symbolic terms a drama of social disintegration and redemption, set in an isolated BC community... These themes are presented in a style which itself balances on a &quot;double hook&quot;: it is simultaneously local and universal, realistic and symbolic.&quot;

Watson has said the &quot;double hook&quot; of her title refers to the idea &quot;that when you fish for the glory you catch the darkness too. That if you hook twice the glory you hook twice the fear.&quot; She explained that her novel is &quot;about how people are driven, how if they have no art, how if they have no tradition, how if they have no ritual, they are driven in one of 2 ways, either towards violence or towards insensibility – if they have no mediating rituals which manifest themselves in what I suppose we call art forms.&quot;

In 1992 Watson published a novel, Deep Hollow Creek, which she had written in the 1930s. It was shortlisted that year for the Governor General&#x27;s Award. &quot;&quot;Deep Hollow Creek&quot; treats many of the same themes&quot; as &quot;The Double Hook&quot; &quot;in a manner which is more direct and conventional, but no less elliptical and challenging. It is fascinating to imagine the ways in which Canadian fiction might have been transformed if this startling and brilliant novel had been published at the time of its first composition.&quot;

In the 1950s Watson published three interlinked stories, and a fourth in 1970, dealing with the family of Sophocles&#x27; Oedipus in a contemporary, realistic setting. The most critically discussed of these is &quot;Antigone&quot;, a setting of the story of Creon and Antigone in the wilds of British Columbia.

== Recognition ==
Watson was awarded the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal in 1984.

The third epigraph of Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; reads:

According to Nathalie Cooke, this is from &quot;Deep Hollow Creek&quot;, and it announces Atwood&#x27;s third dominant theme, the power of the word itself.
A biography, &quot;Always Someone to Kill the Doves: A Life of Sheila Watson&quot; by F.T. Flahiff was published in 2005.

The University of St. Michael&#x27;s College held a two-day event, &quot;Celebrating Sheila,&quot; on October 24 and 25, 2009, to mark the 100th anniversary of Watson&#x27;s birth and the 50th anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Double Hook&quot;.

In 2015 Joseph Pivato edited &quot;Sheila Watson: Essays on Her Works&quot; which includes new essays on her life and work as an author, editor and mentor.

==Languages==

===Characteristic sequence of letters===
*I always comes before E (but after C, E comes before I)
In most words like friend, field, piece, pierce, mischief, thief, tier, it is &quot;&quot;i&quot; which comes before &quot;e&quot;. But on some words with c just before the pair of e and i, like receive, perceive, &quot;e&quot; comes before &quot;i&quot;&quot;. This can be remembered by the following mnemonic,

:::I before E, except after C

But this is not always obeyed as in case of weird and weigh, weight, height, neighbor etc. and can be remembered by extending that mnemonic as given below

:::I before E, except after C
:::&quot;Or when sounded &quot;A&quot; as in neighbor, weigh and weight&quot;
:::&quot;Or when sounded like &quot;eye&quot; as in height&quot;
:::&quot;And &quot;weird&quot; is just weird&quot;

Another variant, which avoids confusion when the two letters represent different sounds instead of a single sound, as in atheist or being, runs

:::When it says ee
:::Put i before e
:::But not after c

*Where ever there is a Q there is a U too
Most frequently &quot;u&quot; follows &quot;q&quot;. e.g.: Que, queen, question, quack, quark, quartz, quarry, quit, Pique, torque, macaque, exchequer. Hence the mnemonic:
:::&quot;Where ever there is a Q there is a U too&quot; (But this is violated by some words; see:List of English words containing Q not followed by U)

===Letters of specific syllables in a word===
*BELIEVE
::Do not believe a lie.
*SECRETARY
::A secretary must keep a secret
*TEACHER
::There is an ache in every teacher.
*MEASUREMENT
::Be sure of your measurements before you start work.
*FRIEND
::Fri the end of your &quot;fri&quot;end
*SPECIAL
::The CIA have special agents
*BEAUTIFUL
::Big Elephants Are Ugly
*SEPARATE
::Always smell a&quot; rat when you spell sepa&quot;rate
::&quot;There was a farmer named Sep and one day his wife saw a rat. She yelled, &quot;Sep! A rat – E!!!&quot;&quot;
*PRINCIPAL
::The principal is your pal.

===Distinguishing between similar words===
*Difference between Advice &amp; Advise, Practice &amp; Practise, Licence &amp; License etc.
Advice, Practice, Licence etc. (those with c) are nouns and Advise, Practise, License etc. are verbs.
:::&quot;One way of remembering this is that the word &#x27;noun&#x27; comes before the word &#x27;verb&#x27; in the dictionary; likewise &#x27;c&#x27; comes before &#x27;s&#x27;, so the nouns are &#x27;practice, licence, advice&#x27; and the verbs are &#x27;practise, license, advise&#x27;.&quot;

*Here or Hear
::We hear with our ear.

*Complement and Compliment
::complement &quot;adds something to make it enough&quot;
::compliment &quot;puts you in the limelight&quot;

*Principle and Principal
::Your principal is your pal
::A rule can be called a principle

*Remedial and Menial 
::Remedial work is meant to remedy.
::Menial work is boring but it&#x27;s mean (-ial) to complain.

*Their, There and They&#x27;re
::Theirs is not mine even though &#x27;I&#x27; is in it.
::There is where we&#x27;ll be.
::They&#x27;re is a contraction of &#x27;they are.&#x27;

*Stationary and stationery
::Stationery contains er and so does paper; stationary (not moving) contains ar and so does car
::A for &quot;at rest&quot;, e for envelope

*Gray and grey
::Gray is preferred in America while grey is preferred in England

<text>IBM ViaVoice was a range of language-specific continuous speech recognition software products offered by IBM. The current version is designed primarily for use in embedded devices. The latest stable version of IBM Via Voice was 9.0 and was able to transfer text directly into Microsoft Word.

The most important process for the correct use of this software is the so-called &#x27;quick training&#x27;, and &#x27;enrollment&#x27;: it consists of reading many specific words and sentences in order to make the software adapt itself to the specific users&#x27; sound and intonation features. It lasts for one hour or more and can be divided in many parts. Users are able to improve decoding accuracy, by reading prepared texts of a few hundred sentences. The recorded data was used to tune the acoustic model to that specific user. In addition, user specific text files could be parsed to tune the language model. Correction of mis-recognised words was also used to improve subsequent decode accuracy.

==Editions==
Individual language editions may have different features, specifications, technical support, and microphone support. Some of the products or editions available are:
* Advanced Edition,
* Standard Edition,
* Personal Edition,
* ViaVoice for Mac OS X Edition,
* Pro USB Edition,
* Simple Dictation for Mac.

The IBM Via Voice 98™ has been available in the Home, Office and Executive Edition in the following languages:

Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, UK English, US English. The Executive Edition allows you to dictate into most Windows applications and control them using your voice.

Designed for Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0, it has been working very well with Windows 7.

In the Executive package are included:
* original software and user guide on CD-ROM;
* quality headset with microphone by Andrea Electronics Corporation™ with a converter plug for Sound Blaster™ sound cards and ThinkPad™;
* printed voice command reference card;
*telephone support for one month.

==History==
Prior to the development of ViaVoice, IBM launched a product in 1993 named the IBM Personal Dictation System (later renamed to VoiceType) which ran on Windows, AIX, and OS/2. In 1997, ViaVoice was first introduced to the general public. Two years later, in 1999, IBM released a free of charge version of ViaVoice.

In 2003, IBM awarded ScanSoft, which owned the competitive product Dragon NaturallySpeaking, exclusive global distribution rights to ViaVoice Desktop products for Windows and Mac OS X. Two years later, Nuance merged with ScanSoft.

<doc id="640249" wikidata="Q690935" url="?curid=640249" title="Saddle point">
<text>In mathematics, a saddle point or minimax point is a point on the surface of the graph of a function where the slopes (derivatives) in orthogonal directions are all zero (a critical point), but which is not a local extremum of the function. An example of a saddle point is when there is a critical point with a relative minimum along one axial direction (between peaks) and a relative maximum along the crossing axis. However, a saddle point need not be in this form. For example, the function formula_1 has a critical point at formula_2 that is a saddle point since it is neither a relative maximum nor relative minimum, but it does not have a relative maximum or relative minimum in the formula_3-direction.

The name derives from the fact that the prototypical example in two dimensions is a surface that &quot;curves up&quot; in one direction, and &quot;curves down&quot; in a different direction, resembling a riding saddle. In terms of contour lines, a saddle point in two dimensions gives rise to a contour map with a pair of lines intersecting at the point. Such intersections are rare in actual ordnance survey maps, as the height of the saddle point is unlikely to coincide with the integer multiples used in such maps. Instead, the saddle point appears as a blank space in the middle of four sets of contour lines that approach and veer away from it. For a basic saddle point, these sets occur in pairs, with an opposing high pair and an opposing low pair positioned in orthogonal directions. The critical contour lines generally do not have to intersect orthogonally.


== Mathematical discussion ==
A simple criterion for checking if a given stationary point of a real-valued function &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) of two real variables is a saddle point is to compute the function&#x27;s Hessian matrix at that point: if the Hessian is indefinite, then that point is a saddle point. For example, the Hessian matrix of the function formula_4 at the stationary point formula_5 is the matrix
: formula_6
which is indefinite. Therefore, this point is a saddle point. This criterion gives only a sufficient condition. For example, the point formula_7 is a saddle point for the function formula_8 but the Hessian matrix of this function at the origin is the null matrix, which is not indefinite.

In the most general terms, a saddle point for a smooth function (whose graph is a curve, surface or hypersurface) is a stationary point such that the curve/surface/etc. in the neighborhood of that point is not entirely on any side of the tangent space at that point.
In a domain of one dimension, a saddle point is a point which is both a stationary point and a point of inflection. Since it is a point of inflection, it is not a local extremum.

== Saddle surface ==


A saddle surface is a smooth surface containing one or more saddle points.

Classical examples of two-dimensional saddle surfaces in the Euclidean space are second order surfaces, the hyperbolic paraboloid formula_4 (which is often referred to as &quot;&quot;the&quot; saddle surface&quot; or &quot;the standard saddle surface&quot;) and the hyperboloid of one sheet. The Pringles potato chip or crisp is an everyday example of a hyperbolic paraboloid shape.

Saddle surfaces have negative Gaussian curvature which distinguish them from convex/elliptical surfaces which have positive Gaussian curvature. A classical third-order saddle surface is the monkey saddle.

==Examples==
In a two-player zero sum game defined on a continuous space, the equilibrium point is a saddle point.

For a second-order linear autonomous system, a critical point is a saddle point if the characteristic equation has one positive and one negative real eigenvalue.

In optimization subject to equality constraints, the first-order conditions describe a saddle point of the Lagrangian.

== Other uses ==
In dynamical systems, if the dynamic is given by a differentiable map &quot;f&quot; then a point is hyperbolic if and only if the differential of &quot;ƒ&quot; &quot;n&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is the period of the point) has no eigenvalue on the (complex) unit circle when computed at the point. Then
a &quot;saddle point&quot; is a hyperbolic periodic point whose stable and unstable manifolds have a dimension that is not zero.

A saddle point of a matrix is an element which is both the largest element in its column and the smallest element in its row.

<text>Namba Parks (なんばパークス &quot;Nanba Pākusu&quot;) is an office and shopping complex located in Namba-naka Nichome, Naniwa-ku, Osaka, Japan, the south of Namba Station on Nankai Railway. It consists of a high-rise office building called Parks Tower and a 120-tenant shopping mall with rooftop garden. Namba Parks was developed by Jon Jerde of The Jerde Partnership in the footprint of the since closed Osaka Stadium.

There is a carnival mall on the 1st floor. For shopping, various shops are available on 2nd to 5th floor. Casual restaurants are located on 6th floor while fine-dining restaurants are on the 7th and 8th floor, where you can choose from various kinds of food, such as Japanese, Korean, and Italian. The 9th floor (topmost) has landscape garden. There is also an amphitheater for live shows, as well as space for small personal vegetable gardens and wagon shops.

Namba Parks was conceived as a large park, a natural intervention in Osaka&#x27;s dense urban condition. Alongside a 30-story tower, the project features a lifestyle commercial center crowned with a rooftop park that crosses multiple blocks while gradually ascending eight levels. In addition to providing a highly visible green component in a city where nature is sparse, the sloping park connects to the street, making it easy for passers-by to enter its groves of trees, clusters of rocks, cliffs, lawn, streams, waterfalls, ponds and outdoor terraces. Beneath the park, a canyon carves a path through specialty retail, entertainment and dining venues.

<text>Sir Harold Montague &quot;Monty&quot; Finniston FRS FRSE (15 August 1912 – 2 February 1991) was a Scottish industrialist.

==Life==

He was born at 26 Aikenhead Road in Govanhill, Glasgow the son of Robert Finniston. His family were of Russian Jewish origin, and their surname had originally been Feinstein before settling in Scotland. He attended Allan Glen&#x27;s School.

Monty Finniston read metallurgical chemistry at the University of Glasgow, where he gained his PhD and then lectured in metallurgy. 

He spent the years of the Second World War in the Royal Naval Scientific Service, seconded to the Chalk River Laboratories in Canada working on the application of nuclear power to submarines. After the war he worked in Canada, and then was appointed Chief Metallurgist at the Atomic Energy Authority, Harwell. The years 1948–1958 which he spent there were a time of rapid development of nuclear power. Finniston initiated and oversaw a wide-ranging research programme into the many metallurgical problems associated with nuclear reactor design, involving uranium fuel elements, their light alloy cladding, and reactor containment vessels.
In 1958 he moved to north-east England to become Director of the Nuclear Research Centre newly founded by the Newcastle engineering firm C. A. Parsons. When enthusiasm for atomic power waned in the early 1960s, he persuaded Parsons&#x27; board to convert the Centre into International Research and Development Ltd. (IRD), a wide-ranging contract engineering research company.

He was Vice-President of the Royal Society, 1971–72. He became chairman of British Steel Corporation in 1973, and was knighted in the same year.

In 1974 he was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal, and in 1975 he was awarded the A. A. Griffith Medal and Prize and elected President of the Institution of Metallurgists.

In 1976 he was invited to deliver the Marlow (Scotland) Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;The Developing Role of Management in Industry&quot;.

In 1978 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir John Atwell, Sir Samuel Curran, Robert A. Smith and Francis Penny.

In response to complaints from industry about a shortage of qualified engineers, the government in 1977 invited Finniston to set up a committee of enquiry into British engineering. In 1979 the committee delivered the Finniston Report, which addressed the concerns that engineering was of relatively low status in the UK. One of the main recommendations was that universities should offer engineering degrees (BEng and MEng) rather than just science degrees (BSc). This report also led to the establishment of the Engineering Council in 1982, and of WISE (Women into Science and Engineering) in 1984. Despite this chance to help Engineering in the UK, Finniston&#x27;s effort was effectively quashed by the &#x27;Big Three&#x27; institutions - the Mechanicals, Electricals, and Civils - who subsequently have done nothing to bolster the status of the Engineer in the UK, whilst other major countries have succeeded.

Sir Monty Finniston was Chancellor of Stirling University from 1979 to 1988, in succession to Lord Robbins. In 1981 he founded the Prison Reform Trust (PRT). He was President of the Association for Project Management from 1984 until his death in 1991.

He died on 2 February 1991.

==Family==

In 1936 he married Miriam Singer.

<doc id="640256" wikidata="Q512296" url="?curid=640256" title="Midland Football Alliance">
<text>The Midland Football Alliance was an English association football league for semi-professional teams. It covered Leicestershire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Midlands, Worcestershire and also southern parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. The league consisted of a single division which sat at Step 5 of the National League System, or the ninth level of the overall English football league system.

The league was formed in 1994, drawing its initial membership from the strongest clubs in the Midland Football Combination and the West Midlands (Regional) League, both of which became feeder leagues to the new competition. Each season, the champion club of each feeder league was eligible for promotion to the Alliance, and Alliance clubs could in turn be relegated to the feeder leagues. Successful teams in the Alliance were eligible for promotion to a Step 4 league, either the Southern League or Northern Premier League depending on geographical considerations. The league merged with the Midland Combination in 2014 to form the new Midland Football League.

==History==
The Alliance was formed in 1994, taking its initial member clubs from the West Midlands (Regional) League and the Midland Football Combination, which had existed since before the Second World War, having originally been formed as the Birmingham &amp; District League and the Worcestershire Combination respectively. Their catchment areas had gradually converged, and by the early 1990s the standard of play and geographical coverage of the two competitions were considered to be similar enough that a new competition was formed to cater for the best clubs previously split across the two leagues.

The league drew ten member clubs from each of the two leagues for its inaugural season. The clubs selected to join from the Midland Combination were Barwell, Boldmere St Michaels, Bolehall Swifts, Pershore Town, Sandwell Borough, Shepshed Dynamo, Shifnal Town, Stapenhill, Stratford Town and West Midlands Police. Those selected from the West Midlands (Regional) League were Brierley Hill Town, Chasetown, Halesowen Harriers, Hinckley Athletic, Knypersley Victoria, Oldbury United, Paget Rangers, Rocester, Rushall Olympic and Willenhall Town. Paget Rangers won the first league championship by a margin of 12 points from Hinckley Athletic in the 1994–95 season, and gained promotion to the Southern League. The Alliance&#x27;s status as a feeder to the Southern League was cemented when Armitage 90 were relegated in the opposite direction. Armitage went on to dominate the league in the 1995–96 season but disbanded midway through the season, with the result that their record was expunged from the table.
For the 1999–2000 season the league increased in size to 22 clubs when two clubs were promoted into the Alliance but none relegated out of it. One of the promoted clubs was Oadby Town of the Leicestershire Senior League, the first time a team from that league had been promoted into the Alliance. Two years later, the league increased in size to 23 clubs as more teams joined than left, but Stapenhill resigned midway through the 2001–02 season, reverting the number of clubs in the competition back to 22. The league expanded to 24 clubs for the 2003–04 season, at the end of which, for the first time, Alliance clubs were promoted to the Northern Premier League, rather than the Southern League, when Rocester and Willenhall Town joined the more northerly of the two leagues. The following season Coalville Town became the first Alliance team to reach the first round proper of the FA Cup, a feat which was repeated in the 2005–06 season by both Chasetown and Leamington.

With the creation of the National League System by the Football Association the league was officially defined as a Step 5 league. The champions of the Midland Combination, West Midlands (Regional) League and Leicestershire Senior League continued to gain promotion to the Alliance, although in 2008 the new East Midlands Counties Football League was formed at the Step 6 level and it was anticipated that successful teams from the Leicestershire Senior League, which is officially a Step 7 league, would now move up to the new league and that the champions of the new league would in turn move up to the Alliance if they fell within its coverage area.

In 2014 the Alliance merged with the Midland Combination to form the new Midland Football League. The clubs which had been members of the Alliance formed the Premier Division of the new league.

==Structure==
The Alliance was known under various sponsored names following deals with companies including Baker-Joiner, Polymac Services, Harvey World Travel, Travel Factory, and Aspire. In July 2008, it was announced that 23 teams would compete in the Alliance in the 2008–09 season, however the following week it was announced that Stapenhill had folded, leaving 22 teams in the league. The league was contested on a double round-robin basis, with each team playing each of the other teams in the division once at home and once away. Three points were awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a defeat. Goal difference was used to separate teams on the same points.

As the Alliance was a Step 5 league, its member clubs were eligible to take part in the FA Cup and FA Vase as long as their grounds met the required standards. The league also operated two cup competitions of its own, the knock-out League Cup, which was staged every season, and the Joe McGorian Cup, which was contested between the previous season&#x27;s League Cup winners and league champions and which was first contested in 1996.

According to official FA regulations, clubs from the Alliance were eligible for promotion to a Step 4 league, provided their grounds met the required standard. Clubs promoted from Step 5 leagues were placed in the most geographically appropriate Step 4 leagues as determined by the FA&#x27;s Leagues Committee. The number of clubs promoted from the Alliance each season could vary, as regulations stated that the &quot;ten most suitable clubs from the leagues at Step 5&quot; will gain promotion. All clubs gaining promotion from the Alliance were placed in either the Southern League or the Northern Premier League. Teams finishing at the bottom of the Alliance table could be relegated to an appropriate feeder league, depending on the number of teams remaining in the division after other promotion and relegation issues have been resolved.

==Attendance==

Attendances at Midland Alliance matches were generally small, with many matches attracting fewer than 100 spectators. In the 2006–07 season the average attendance across the league was 124, but in the 2007–08 season this fell to 87. The best supported team in that season was Atherstone Town, whose average home attendance was 162. The worst supported team was Oldbury United whose matches drew an average of only 39 spectators. The highest attendance for a single match was 411, for the match between Stratford Town and Barwell. Barwell also took part in the match with the lowest attendance, when their game away to Oldbury United drew only 20 spectators.

The largest crowd ever registered for an Alliance match was 1,280, for the match between Racing Club Warwick and local rivals Leamington on 26 December 2005. The smallest crowd recorded was 10, for a match between Wednesfield and Biddulph Victoria on 19 April 2003.

== Champions and cup-winners ==
The league champions and clubs promoted from the league were as follows:

<doc id="640260" wikidata="Q1213999" url="?curid=640260" title="Commissar (film)">
<text>Commissar (, translit. Komissar) is a 1967 Soviet film directed by Aleksandr Askoldov based on one of Vasily Grossman&#x27;s first short stories, &quot;In the Town of Berdychev&quot; (В городе Бердичеве). Berdychev is centrally located in the north of Ukraine. The action takes place during the Russian Civil War (1918–22), when the Red Army, White Army, Polish and Austrian contingents were battling for territory. Of equal importance is the fact that in Berdychev, at that time, the Yiddish language was officially instated and, from 1924, it had a Ukrainian court of law conducting its affairs in Yiddish. The plot is based upon an intimate intersection of revolutionary and Jewish cultural manners and ideals. The main characters were played by two People&#x27;s Artists of the USSR, Rolan Bykov and Nonna Mordyukova. It was made at Gorky Film Studio.

Maxim Gorky considered this brief story one of the best about the Russian Civil War and encouraged the young writer to dedicate himself to literature. It also drew favourable attention from Mikhail Bulgakov, Boris Pilnyak, and Isaac Babel.

==History of the film==
The film was shot in the political climate of the Khrushchev Thaw, following the death of Stalin. The period is characterized by a loosening of political oppression and artistic censorship. From the outset of the production, Goskino censors forced the film director Aleksandr Askoldov to make major changes; 1967 was the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution and the events were to be presented in the Communist Party-mandated style of heroic realism.

After making the film, Askoldov lost his job, was expelled from the Communist Party, charged with social parasitism, exiled from Moscow, and banned from working on feature films for life. He was told that the single copy of the film had been destroyed. Mordyukova and Bykov, major Soviet movie stars, had to plead with the authorities to spare him of even bigger charges. The film was shelved by the KGB for twenty years.

In 1986, due to glasnost policies, the Conflict Commission of the Soviet Film-makers Union recommended the re-release of the movie, but Goskino refused to act. After a plea from Askoldov at the Moscow Film Festival, the film was reconstructed and finally released in 1988. The film is set in Ukraine, and those who know the language will spot the Ukrainisms in Bykov&#x27;s lines.

The film won the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival in 1988, four professional Nika Awards (1989), including one to composer Alfred Schnittke, and other awards. The film was selected as the Soviet entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 61st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
During the Russian Civil War (1918–1922), a female commissar of the Red Army cavalry Klavdia Vavilova (Nonna Mordyukova) finds herself pregnant. Until her child is born, she is forced to stay with the family of a poor Jewish blacksmith Yefim Magazannik (Rolan Bykov), his wife, mother-in-law, and six children. At first, both the Magazannik family and &quot;Madame Vavilova&quot;, as they call her, are not enthusiastic about living under one roof, but soon they share their rationed food, make her civilian clothes, and help her with the delivery of her newborn son. Vavilova seemingly embraces motherhood, civilian life, and new friends.

Meanwhile, the frontline advances closer to the town and the Jews expect a pogrom by the White Army as the Red Army retreats. Vavilova attempts to console them with a Communist dream: &quot;One day people will work in peace and harmony&quot;, but the dream is interrupted with a vision of the fate of the Jews in the coming world war. She rushes to the front to rejoin her army regiment, leaving her newborn behind.

== Themes ==
&quot;Commissar&quot; features strong themes of feminism and motherhood in the backdrop of the Russian Civil War of 1918, and when completed was censored by the Soviet Union due to the subject topic being deemed: &quot;a force that opposes the very essence of human existence, a phenomenon that destroys personal ties by causing alienation, despair, and uncertainty about the future.&quot; In effect the censors saw the subject content and focus too negative for a state mandated heroic realism style, as in the opening scene a singing Madonna is passed by a marching regiment that eclipses the sound of her singing with their march. For the censors at the time, to portray the revolution as anything other than a positive change in society was a dangerous risk. &quot;Commissar&quot; was the only film ever made by the director Aleksandr Askoldov, and it nearly had him arrested by the KGB.

In this opening it is clearly foreshadowed that there would be conflicting themes about motherhood and military service, and this is furthered by the protagonist’s internal struggle between her devotion to the Russian revolution and her devotion to her child. The positivity of the feminist themes are reinforced with the witticisms of the Magazannik family, who have six children, and are more concerned with the wellbeing of their family than with the war. This is best conveyed in a scene where Yefim Magazannik (the father of the family and a local blacksmith) responds to an anecdote by Vavilova about the ideal of the soviet utopia where all men are equal in work with &quot;but what about life?&quot; Though the ending of the film features Klavdia Vavilova fleeing the Jewish household and her newborn son, this is due to the state-mandated style of heroic realism in film eclipsing the themes inherent to the overall work. Vavilova leaving may also be influenced by the children&#x27;s favorite game, portraying the White Army hunting Jews. Immediately prior to Vavilova deciding to leave, there is a particularly brutal scene where the male children chase and bind their sister, ripping her clothes as she calls out for her mother. Their father reprimands them harshly, but Vavilova appears greatly troubled by the event and may feel a responsibility to prevent this type of brutality.

Vavilova is characterized as unquestionably manly, a 1988 film review done by James Lardner calling her &quot;an inconveniently pregnant Bolshevik [and] a tough cookie&quot;. She is first introduced to viewers as a hardened military commissar, having just sentenced a soldier to death for going AWOL to visit his wife. She is respected by her commanding officer, which is made evident when Vavilova states that her deceased lover &quot;was a good communist&quot; to which her boss replies &quot;you are all good communists&quot;. However once Vavilova relieves herself of her riding breeches and Mauser handgun, and is settled into the house of the Magazanniks, she falls out of favor with her once gracious coworkers. Once she embraces civilian life and the caveats that come with it, she seemingly loses her masculine qualities as her gun is replaced with her baby, and her leather pants are traded for civilian clothes made for her by the Magazanniks. Towards the end of the film, the frontline of the conflict begins to approach the town of Berdichev, and the Red Army begins retreating, Vavilova is left behind with rationed food. The Magazanniks worry that the coming shift of power there would bring another pogrom committed by the White Army, and Vavilova begins once again to abandon her motherly persona to relay the communist dream that all men will work in peace and harmony. The conflict inherent to the film being that while the revolution rages in the background, the true conflict is that between Vavilova’s treasured child and her patriotism and devotion to her job. In the end of the film Vavilova flees the home of the Magazanniks to attempt to rejoin her cavalry regiment at the front lines.

This complies with the film style of historic realism which acted to appeal to the masses of communist society, the protagonist acting selflessly, abandoning her child in order to join the forces attempting to save the village exemplifies this, and to a degree eclipses the feminist tone of the film in lieu of state mandated propagandist themes. Moreover, the transition from soldier-to-mother further reinforces the feminist tone of the film, as well as contributing to the thaw in Soviet dogma in the late fifties and sixties. In the journal &quot;Redressing the Commissar: Thaw Cinema Revises Soviet Structuring Myths,&quot; Andsell summarizes the lesson learned by the protagonist and the message conveyed by the director simply:

Askoldov symbolically depicts the Thaw’s search in his heroine’s journey of physical and psychological liberation facilitated by her new, small-family environment. The stages of Klavdia’s emotional and spiritual maturation in the film reverse the symbolic &quot;progress toward consciousness&quot; and the ritual initiation into the &quot;big family&quot; that shaped Stalin-era Civil War discourse, reappearing in the late Thaw quasi-Stalinist narratives. Askoldov’s inverted enactment of a conventional Stalinist rite of passage shows Klavdia undergo its three main phases: separation from previous environment, transition to a new system of values and incorporation into the new community.

Socially, the film retrospectively propagates a feminine pride in the socialist ideal, as Vavilova is presented as an independent and powerful woman who initially is seemingly unfazed by the death of her lover. She is more inconvenienced by her pregnancy, and is eager to go back into the fray of the Revolution. At the time of the Revolution, a major principle of the initial communist party was the freedom from discrimination based on religion and gender, and suffrage for women.

<text>The Sepsidae are a family of flies, commonly called the black scavenger flies or ensign flies. Over 300 species are described worldwide. They are usually found around dung or decaying plant and animal material. Many species resemble ants, having a &quot;waist&quot; and glossy black body. Many Sepsidae have a curious wing-waving habit made more apparent by dark patches at the wing end.

Many species have a very wide distribution, reflecting the coprophagous habit of most Sepsidae. Some species have been spread over large territories in association with livestock. Adult flies are found mostly on mammal excrement, including that of humans (less often on other rotting organic matter), where eggs are laid and larvae develop, and on nearby vegetation, carrion, fermenting tree sap, and shrubs and herbs.

Many Sepsidae apparently play an important biological role as decomposers of mammal and other animal excrement. Some species may have a limited hygienic importance because of their association with human feces. Others are useful tools in forensic entomology.

Sepsids are slender flies that resemble minute, winged ants. They are usually black in color, sometimes lustrous, and sometimes with silvery hairs on the thorax. The head is rounded. Sepsids have one or more bristles at the posteroventral margin of the posterior spiracle of the thorax, a character that distinguishes the family from other acalyptrates. The postvertical bristles are divergent or sometimes absent. Up to three pairs of frontal bristles are seen. They have ocelli with ocellar bristles. Vibrissae and palpi are poorly developed. The front legs of the male often have extrusions, spurs, teeth, or other ornamentation. The tibia has a dorsal preapical bristle in most genera. The abdomen is usually constricted in the basal part.

The larva is slender, tapering at the front end, and smooth except for ventral creeping welts. The larva is amphipneustic: it has two pairs of spiracles, one toward the head and one at the tail. The bulbous posterior end with its pair of spiracles distinguishes it from the larvae of other acalyptrates.

The pupa is enclosed within a puparium.

<text>The Southern Counties East Football League is an English football league established in 1966, which has teams based in Kent and Southeast London. Its two divisions are allocated at Step 5 and Step 6 of the National League System (which equates to Levels 9–10 of the overall English football league system). At its inception it was known for two seasons as the Kent Premier League and then, until 2013, as the Kent League.

There is no direct connection between this league and a previous Kent League that existed from 1894 to 1959, despite many clubs having spells of membership in both leagues.

==History==
The current league was formed in 1966, from teams in and around the county of Kent, when the Thames &amp; Medway Combination (which had its origins in 1896) was expanded and renamed the Kent Premier League. The league began with fourteen teams - five of the six members of the final Thames &amp; Medway Combination season (Deal Town Reserves, Orpington Athletic, Sittingbourne Reserves, Snowdown CW and Tonbridge Reserves) plus nine additional members (Ashford Town Reserves, Bexley United Reserves, Canterbury City Reserves, Faversham Town, Folkestone Town Reserves, Margate Reserves, Ramsgate Athletic Reserves, Sheppey United Reserves,Tunbridge Wells Rangers Reserves). Additionally the teams contested a league cup competition. Two years later in 1968 the league was renamed the Kent Football League.

During its first ten years many of the league&#x27;s members were reserve sides of Southern League teams; in 1975 there was an unsuccessful proposal to exclude reserves teams from the primary division and instigate a second division. There followed several seasons by the league of discouragement of reserves teams until the 1978–79 season when a division for first teams only was established, titled Division One and reserve teams were shifted into a newly formed Division Two (which didn&#x27;t exclude first teams); a Division Two knock-out cup competition was also initiated. Subsequently all divisions below the league&#x27;s top division were known as the &#x27;Reserves Section&#x27; and there was no automatic promotion/relegation from the Reserves Section into/from the top division.

The league continued with this format until the 1998–1999 season when the divisions were renamed as the Premier Division and Division One (from Division One and Division Two respectively) - with floodlights being a requirement for clubs in the Premier Division. The following season Division One was split into two equal ranked regional (North and South) Divisions with a play-off match between the two winners to decide the Division One champion. After reverting to a single Division One for the 2000–01 season, for both the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons Division One was again split into North and South Divisions. Thereafter for the following nine seasons the Reserves section was divided into two merit based divisions, Division One and Division Two, with promotion/relegation between the two divisions; Division One initially comprised the higher ranked teams from the two regional Division One leagues with the new Division Two taking the remaining teams. For the 2012–2013 season, the final one the league was known as the Kent League, the competition reverted to a two division format comprising the Premier Division and Reserves Section Division One.

In 2013 the league changed its name to the Southern Counties East League, to reflect that many of its member clubs no longer played within the county of Kent. and reverted to a single division for three seasons. At the end of the 2015–16 season, the league merged with the Kent Invicta League: the former single Southern Counties East League was designated as the Premier Division and the former Kent Invicta league became Division One.

==Promotion and relegation==
From 1982 the league became a designated feeder league to the Southern League and during the following twenty seasons nine Kent League clubs gained promotion. From 2004, following further rationalisation of the structure of non-League football which saw the redrawing of the border between the Southern Football League and the Isthmian League, the Premier Division champions are promoted to the Isthmian League.

Prior to the 2011–12 season clubs could be relegated to the Kent County League, although in practice this rarely happened, albeit clubs had moved in the opposite direction on being elected to the Kent League. The formation of the new Kent Invicta Football League for the 2011–12 season created a league at Step 6 rather than Step 7 allowing for a less steep transition; clubs were regularly promoted from the Kent Invicta League but until it amalgamated with the SCEFL in 2015 no clubs were relegated to this step 6 league.

==Sponsorship==
Following their sponsorship of the Kent League Cup for the 1984–85 season, cable-making company Winstonlead extended their sponsorship to cover the League and this ran for 15 seasons between 1985 and 1999 during which period the competition was styled as the Winstonlead Kent League. They were succeeded by brewing company Bass as sponsors for three seasons during which the league was titled the Bass Brewers Kent League. In 2002 Kent based travel agency business Go Travel were the sponsor with the competition known as the Go Travel Kent League. The sponsor changed in 2005 to the Kent on Sunday newspaper and for a single season, 2005–06, the league was known as the Kentish Observer League. There followed two years without a title sponsor until 2008 when it was sponsored for two seasons by Bulmers and named the Bulmers Cider Kent League. For the 2010–11 season, training and consultancy business Safety Net Associates were the sponsors with the league known as the Safety Net Associates Kent League. Thereafter for two seasons commencing with the 2011–12 season the league was sponsored by Hürlimann Sternbräu lager (brewed by Kentish brewers Shepherd Neame) and billed as the Kent Hurlimann Football League.

After six seasons without a title sponsor, in November 2019 shipping company Sea Pioneer was named as sponsor with the competition known as the Sea Pioneer Southern Counties East Football League – this arrangement ceased with the interruption of football in March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The league next announced a sponsorship agreement in June 2024 with Tunbridge Wells based property management firm Presence &amp; Co., with the league to be known for the following two seasons as the Presence &amp; Co. Southern Counties East Football League.

The League&#x27;s knock-out cup competitions have intermittently attracted separate sponsorship: from 2011 to 2018 the Challenge Cup was sponsored by sportswear brand Macron; the Reserves Section cup was known for the 2008–09 season as the HAUC (Highways Agency Utilities Committee) Reserves Cup and for the following two seasons to 2010–11 was sponsored by (infrastructure provider) Blu3.

==Current structure and teams==
Since 2016–17 the Premier Division is designated at Step 5 with Division One at Step 6 of the National League System (which equates to Levels 9–10 of the overall English football league system). Clubs are able to move upwards to the Step 4 divisions of the Isthmian League; teams are relegated into the Kent County League which is the feeder league into Division One.

<text>Gerald Goffin (February 11, 1939 – June 19, 2014) was an American lyricist. Collaborating initially with his first wife, Carole King, he co-wrote many international pop hits of the early and mid-1960s, including the US No.1 hits &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Take Good Care of My Baby&quot;, &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, and &quot;Go Away Little Girl&quot;. It was later said of Goffin that his gift was &quot;to find words that expressed what many young people were feeling but were unable to articulate.&quot;

After he and King divorced, Goffin wrote with other composers, including Barry Goldberg and Michael Masser, with whom he wrote &quot;Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You&#x27;re Going To)&quot; and &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, also No. 1 hits. During his career, Goffin wrote over 114 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits, including eight chart-toppers, and 72 UK hits. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, with Carole King.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Goffin was born in New York City. As a boy, he wrote lyrics in his head, as a game. In his teen years, he worked for his grandfather, a Russian-born Jewish furrier. He enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve after graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School. After a year at the U.S. Naval Academy as a member of the Class of 1961, he resigned from the Navy to study chemistry at Queens College.

===Partnership with Carole King===

At college he met Carol Joan Klein, who had started writing songs under the name Carole King. They began collaborating on songwriting, with King writing the music and Goffin the lyrics, and began a relationship. When King became pregnant, they left college and married in August 1959 when he was 20 and she was 17. Goffin began working with a chemicals manufacturer, and wrote the lyrics for King&#x27;s 1959 single &quot;Oh Neil&quot;, an answer song to her friend Neil Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Oh! Carol&quot;. Goffin added the words to the tune written by Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, who both worked under Don Kirshner at the Aldon music publishing company in Manhattan; the single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;A Very Special Boy&quot;, was a Goffin-King composition. Although the record was not a hit, the couple both secured contracts to write songs professionally at Aldon.

Goffin at first worked with other writers including Barry Mann and Jack Keller, but he and Carole King soon established themselves as a successful writing team. The partnership&#x27;s breakthrough hit was &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, for which Goffin wrote the lyrics. The song was recorded by the Shirelles and went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in January 1961. Goffin and King formed one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the period, with hit songs including: &quot;Take Good Care of My Baby&quot; (a hit for Bobby Vee), &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot; (Tony Orlando, Billy Fury), &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; (Little Eva, and later Grand Funk Railroad and Kylie Minogue), &quot;Go Away Little Girl&quot; (Steve Lawrence, and later Donny Osmond), &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Nothin&#x27; Bad (About My Baby)&quot; (the Cookies), &quot;It Might as Well Rain Until September&quot; (Carole King), &quot;One Fine Day&quot; (the Chiffons), &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; (the Drifters and later James Taylor), &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot; (Herman&#x27;s Hermits, but recorded first by Earl-Jean McCrea under the name Earl-Jean), &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot; (the Animals), &quot;Oh No Not My Baby&quot; (Maxine Brown, and later Rod Stewart), &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; (Dusty Springfield, The Byrds), &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; (Aretha Franklin), and &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot; (the Monkees). Goffin and King also wrote several songs jointly with record producer Phil Spector. In 1963, John Lennon was quoted as saying that he wanted Paul McCartney and himself to become &quot;the Goffin-King of England&quot;.

In 1964, Goffin fathered a daughter with singer Jeanie Reavis (whose recording of &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot; preceded the better-known version by Herman&#x27;s Hermits), but he and King remained together for several years before divorcing in 1969. Goffin later said in an interview in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that he &quot;wanted to be a hippie — grew my hair long — and Carole did it modestly...And then I started taking LSD and mescaline. And Carole and I began to grow apart because she felt that she had to say things herself. She had to be her own lyricist.&quot; According to King&#x27;s memoir, Goffin suffered from mental illness following ingestion of LSD, eventually undergoing treatment with lithium and electroshock therapy, and was diagnosed with manic depression. His drug use affected his health, and he was hospitalized for a time.

===Other collaborations===
Goffin also worked successfully with other composers in the early 1960s, including Barry Mann (&quot;Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)&quot;) and Jack Keller (&quot;Run to Him&quot;).

After splitting from King, Goffin released a solo album in 1973, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Exactly Entertainment&quot;, but it was not successful, and he began working with other composers, including Russ Titelman, Barry Goldberg, and then Michael Masser. He and Masser won an Academy Award nomination in 1976 for the theme to the film &quot;Mahogany&quot;, sung by Diana Ross; and also wrote &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, a worldwide hit for Whitney Houston, &quot;Tonight, I Celebrate My Love&quot;, &quot;Miss You Like Crazy&quot; and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Change My Love for You&quot;. Goffin and Masser also received a Golden Globe nomination for &quot;So Sad the Song&quot; from the 1976 Gladys Knight film &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;.

Goffin co-wrote three songs for the soundtrack to &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;, a 1996 movie whose principal character&#x27;s life paralleled that of Carole King in many ways.

===Later life===
Goffin and King were inducted together into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

In 1996 he released his second solo album, &quot;Back Room Blood&quot;, which he said was inspired by his anger at conservative gains in the 1994 congressional elections. The album was mostly co-written with Barry Goldberg, but included two songs co-written with Bob Dylan, &quot;Tragedy of the Trade&quot; and &quot;Masquerade&quot;. Goffin described Dylan as &quot;sort of like a god to me&quot;. Goffin was one of the first people to take notice of Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s talent and had hired her to do demo work before she auditioned for &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2002.

Goffin and his fourth wife, Michele, attended opening night of the musical &quot;&quot;, which depicted his marriage to Carole King.

===Personal life===
Gerry Goffin was married to Carole King between 1959 and 1969; they had two daughters, singer-songwriter Louise Goffin and Sherry Goffin Kondor. Goffin also had a daughter, Dawn, with Jeanie Reavis (Earl-Jean McCrea). He married Barbara Behling in the early 1970s and had a son, Jesse Dean Goffin, in 1976. They divorced later that decade. Goffin then married songwriter Ellen Minasian in the 1980s and had one daughter, Lauren, in 1984. Following their divorce, he married actress Michele Conaway (the sister of actor Jeff Conaway) in 1995.

===Death===
Goffin died on June 19, 2014, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 75. His death was announced by his wife, Michele. No cause was specified. He left behind a wife, one son, four daughters, and six grandchildren.

===Tributes===
On hearing of his death, Carole King said that Goffin was her &quot;first love&quot; and had a &quot;profound impact&quot; on her life.&quot; She went on to say, &quot;His words expressed what so many people were feeling but didn&#x27;t know how to say... Gerry was a good man and a dynamic force, whose words and creative influence will resonate for generations to come.&quot; Barry Goldberg, who wrote many later songs with Goffin, said &quot;Gerry was one of the greatest lyricists of all time and my true soul brother.&quot;

<text>Val-d&#x27;Or ( , , ; meaning &quot;Golden Valley&quot; or &quot;Valley of Gold&quot;) is a city in Quebec, Canada with a population of 32,752 inhabitants according to the 2021 Canadian census. The city is located in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region near La Vérendrye Wildlife Reserve.

The Algonquin toponym of the town is &quot;Ozawaconia Odena&quot;.

==History==

Gold was discovered in the area in 1923. The name of the town is French for &quot;Valley of Gold.&quot; While gold is still mined in the area today, base metals, such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) have become increasingly important resources. The ore is usually found in volcanic rocks that were deposited on the sea floor over 2.7 billion years ago. They are referred to as volcanic-hosted (or volcanogenic) massive sulphide deposits (VMS).

The city is known for its vast parks, cycle tracks, and forests. Some other attractions include the City of Gold and the mining village of Bourlamaque, which were officially proclaimed historic sites in 1979.

The city hosted the Quebec Games in 1987. The local hockey team, the Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs, have played in the QMJHL since 1993, winning the league championship in 1998, 2001 and 2014 to claim a spot in the Memorial Cup. They play at Centre Air Creebec. The Foreurs&#x27; mascot is called Dynamit, named after dynamite which was extensively used by the mining industry of Val-d&#x27;Or.

Val-d&#x27;Or was once home to CFS Val-d&#x27;Or, a Canadian Forces Station.

In the municipal reorganizations of January 1, 2002, Val-d&#x27;Or was merged with the neighbouring municipalities of Dubuisson, Sullivan, Val-Senneville and Vassan.

The Radio-Canada investigative television program, Enquête, revealed in October 2015 numerous allegations of assault and sexual abuse of local aboriginal women by members of the provincial police, the Sûreté du Québec. The news propelled the town into the national spotlight, causing Québec&#x27;s Public Safety Minister, Lise Thériault, to suspend the officers and launch an independent investigation led by the Montréal police force.

==Geography==
Val-d&#x27;Or is situated on the Canadian Shield at an elevation of 1100 feet (330m) above sea level. Although its name refers to a valley (&quot;Val&quot;), the city is actually situated on a vast, slightly undulating plain.

Val-d&#x27;Or is at the heart of a vast hydrographic network which includes to the north Lake Blouin, the head water of the Harricana River and to the south Baie Carrière, a reservoir which feeds the Ottawa River.

Val-d&#x27;Or&#x27;s proximity to the Abitibi gold belt has made it a large gold producer, being part of a region that produced 45 million ounces of gold since the 1930s.

In 2012, Quebec Lithium Corp. re-opened a lithium mine which had operated as an underground mine from 1955–65, planning to carve an open pit mine over pegmatite dikes. the mine is about north of Val d&#x27;Or, southeast of Amos, and km west of Barraute. Access to the mine is via paved road from Val d&#x27;Or.

<doc id="640279" wikidata="Q259146" url="?curid=640279" title="John III, Duke of Brittany">
<text>John III &quot;the Good&quot; (in Breton &quot;Yann III&quot;, in French &quot;Jean III&quot;; 8 March 128630 April 1341) was Duke of Brittany, from 1312 to his death and 5th Earl of Richmond from 1334 to his death. He was the son of Arthur II, Duke of Brittany, and his first wife Marie, Viscountess of Limoges. John was strongly opposed to his father&#x27;s second marriage to Yolande and attempted to contest its legality.

In 1297, John married Isabella of Valois, eldest child of Charles, Count of Valois and his first wife Margaret of Naples. At the time of their marriage John was eleven years old and his bride five. She died childless in 1309.

In 1310, John married his second wife, Isabella of Castile. She died childless in 1328.

In 1329, John married his third wife Joan of Savoy. He predeceased his third wife by three years and died childless. He was unwilling to cede the Duchy of Brittany to his half-brother John of Montfort, son of his hated step-mother Yolande. He wished to leave the duchy to the French King Philip VI, but his nobles objected. The marriage of his niece Joanna of Dreux to Charles of Blois gave Charles a plausible claim to the duchy, but the matter was unresolved at John&#x27;s death.

After his death, John of Montfort claimed his rights as duke of Brittany, but King Philip VI supported the Blois faction, and the Breton War of Succession (1341–1364) was triggered. The Breton Civil War was fought between the House of Blois and the House of Montfort. It became part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, as England supported the Montfort faction, which won, against the House of Blois, which was supported by France.

<text>Joan of Penthièvre (; c. 1319 – 10 September 1384), sometimes called Joan the Lame, reigned as Duchess of Brittany together with her husband, Charles of Blois, between 1341 and 1364. Her ducal claims were contested by the House of Montfort, which prevailed only after an extensive civil war, the War of the Breton Succession. After the war, Joan remained titular Duchess of Brittany to her death. She was Countess of Penthièvre in her own right throughout her life.

==Early life==

Joan was the only child of Guy of Penthièvre (brother of John III, Duke of Brittany) and Joan of Avaugour. Through her father she became countess of Penthièvre in her own right, and established her ducal claims.

==War of the Breton Succession==
Joan was one of the protagonists of the War of the Breton Succession. The issue of succession to the ducal crown would involve the issue of whether a child could, regardless of gender, claim the right of &quot;representation&quot; of a deceased parent — in which case Joan would inherit her father&#x27;s rights as the second brother of the late duke of Brittany — or whether the next eldest male heir in a partially parallel lineage outranked all others. In the Breton succession, the collateral claimant was Joan&#x27;s half-uncle John, Count of Montfort, born from the second marriage of Joan&#x27;s grandfather Arthur II, Duke of Brittany to Yolande of Dreux, Queen of Scots. Joan&#x27;s uncle John III had been alienated from Yolande, his stepmother, and sought to prevent his half-brother John from succeeding him, which included an abortive attempt to annul his father&#x27;s second marriage and so render his half-siblings illegitimate.

In December 1335, negotiations were made for a marriage between Joan and John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, the brother of King Edward III of England; however, it appears these arrangements did not result in an official betrothal. In 1337, Joan was betrothed to Charles of Blois in Paris, and they were living together by 1338 or 1339. In 1341, on the death of John III, the couple assumed the rule of the Duchy of Brittany, Charles having been granted permission to perform homage by King Philip VI of France by the &quot;arrêt&quot; of Conflans on 7 September 1341. They appeared to be supported by most of the local nobility and administration. However, John of Montfort did not agree to let go of his own claim, and war ensued. Ironically, while the initial argument of the &quot;Montfortist cause&quot; actually relied very strongly on the idea that Brittany should follow French successorial practice, in subsequent generations the line would vigorously enforce the notion that the Duchy of Brittany should remain independent from its royal neighbor.

When Joan&#x27;s half-uncle John died in 1345 in the midst of the succession war, his wife Joanna of Flanders took arms to protect the rights of their son John IV the Conqueror against the party led by Joan and her husband Charles. Joanna organized resistance and made use of diplomatic means to protect her family&#x27;s position.

After these initial successes, Joan&#x27;s husband Charles of Blois was taken prisoner by the English in 1347. Thomas Dagworth was the official captor of her husband. He was released nine years afterwards, against a ransom of about half a million écus, and resumed the war against the Montforts. Charles died in the Battle of Auray, which determined the end of the war and the victory of the Montforts, leaving Joan a widow.

==Later life==
The contest between the two claimants was then settled in 1365 by the First Treaty of Guérande; by its terms, Joan received a substantial pension (payments of which continued until 1372) in compensation for her claims, the right to maintain the ducal title for life, all her familial lands of Penthièvre and Avaugour, and an exemption from homage to the new duke for these territories. Most critically for future events, her male heirs would recover the duchy if John IV had no male posterity, and women were now formally prohibited from inheriting the duchy.

In 1379, when John IV had been forced into exile in England, King Charles V of France attempted to annex Brittany to the French royal domain. Joan was shocked by this violation of her rights and those of her sons, as laid out in the Treaty of Guérande. Both her supporters and those of the Montfort line united to invite John IV back from his exile in England and retake control of the duchy.

After the death of Charles V, she ratified on 2 May 1381 the Second Treaty of Guérande, which essentially re-stated the terms of the first. From the legal perspective of the Treaties of Guérande, the issue of succession to the ducal crown appeared settled, although Joan&#x27;s descendants provoked various conflicts with John IV and future dukes from the House of Montfort.

==Succession==
Joan died on 10 September 1384 and was buried at the church of the Friars Minor of Guingamp.

Joan had lost the ducal title and powers of Brittany for her descendants, and despite attempts to reclaim the ducal crown this loss was permanent. However, her descendants were appointed from time to time to high administrative posts in Brittany under the future kings of France. Her title and rights as Countess of Penthièvre were inherited only to be lost from time to time to the Duke of Brittany as her descendants continued their conflicts with the House of Montfort.

==Children==
Joan and Charles had the following children:
* Marguerite, married in 1351 Charles de la Cerda (d. 1354)
* Marie (c.1340–1404), Lady of Guise, married in 1360 Louis I, Duke of Anjou
* John I, Count of Penthièvre (1345–1404) - also known as John of Blois
* Guy (d. 1385)
* Henry (d. 1400)
* Charles (d. before 1364)

<text>The War of the Breton Succession (, ) was a conflict between the Counts of Blois and the Montforts of Brittany for control of the Duchy of Brittany, then a fief of the Kingdom of France. It was fought between 1341 and 12 April 1365. It is also known as the War of the Two Joans () due to the involvement of two rival duchesses of that name (Joanna of Flanders and Joan of Penthièvre).

The war formed an integral part of the early Hundred Years&#x27; War due to the proxy involvement of the French and English monarchs in the conflict; the French supported the Blois (female heir) whilst the English backed the Montforts (male heir). The rival kings supported the duke of the principle opposite to their own claims to the French throne—the Plantagenet having claimed it by female succession, and the Valois by male succession. Montfort was ultimately successful following the Battle of Auray in 1364 but, in a surprising turn of events, pledged his loyalty to the king of France and not to the Plantagenet king of England who had supported him.

==Background==
The Breton dukes had both a historical and ancestral connection to Britain and were also earls of Richmond in Yorkshire. Duke Arthur II of Dreux married twice, first to Mary of Limoges (1275–1291), then to Yolande of Dreux (1263–1322), countess of Montfort and widow of King Alexander III of Scotland. From his first marriage, he had three sons, including his heir John III and Guy, count of Penthièvre (d. 1331). From Yolande, Arthur had another son, also named John, who became Count of Montfort. (See Dukes of Brittany family tree.)

John III strongly disliked the children of his father&#x27;s second marriage. He spent the first years of his reign attempting to have this marriage annulled and his half-siblings bastardized. When this failed, he tried to ensure that John of Montfort would never inherit the duchy. Since John III was childless, his heir of choice became Joan of Penthièvre, &quot;la Boiteuse&quot;, daughter of his younger brother Guy. In 1337 she married Charles of Blois, the second son of a powerful French noble house whose mother&#x27;s brother was King Philip VI of France. But in 1340, John III reconciled himself with his half-brother, and made a will that appointed John of Montfort the heir of Brittany. On 30 April 1341, John III died. His last words on the succession, uttered on his deathbed, were, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake leave me alone and do not trouble my spirit with such things&quot;.

==First stage of the war==

Most of the nobility supported Charles of Blois, so if John of Montfort was to have any chance, it was dependent upon swift action before organized resistance could be made. John quickly took possession of the ducal capital Nantes and then seized the Ducal treasury at Limoges. By the middle of August, John of Montfort was in possession of most of the Duchy, the three principal cities of Nantes, Rennes and Vannes.

Up to this point, the succession crisis had been a purely internal affair. But to complicate things further, the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France had broken out four years earlier, in 1337. In 1341, there was a truce between the two countries, but there was little doubt that hostilities would be renewed when the truce ended in June 1342. Thus, when rumours reached Philip VI of France that John of Montfort had received English agents, the French Crown naturally took a more direct interest in their small neighbors situation. Charles of Blois became the official French candidate. Whatever had been his original intentions, John of Montfort was now forced to support Edward III of England as King of France.

Edward III was bound by the truce not to take any offensive action in France. Nothing in it, however, hindered France from subduing rebellious vassals. In November, after a short siege and defeat at the Battle of Champtoceaux, John of Montfort was forced to surrender at Nantes by the citizens. He was offered safe conduct to negotiate a settlement with Charles of Blois, but when this led nowhere he was thrown in prison.

It now fell upon John&#x27;s wife, Joanna of Flanders, to lead the Montfortist cause. Deeming her possessions in the east indefensible, she set up headquarters at Hennebont in western Brittany but was driven into Brest and besieged, the siege being broken by the arrival of an English army under the Earl of Northampton at the naval battle of Brest on 18 August 1342. Northampton then made his way inland and besieged Morlaix after an unsuccessful initial attack. The siege was lifted after the battle of Morlaix on 30 September. In Paris it was feared that Edward III would land at Calais once the truce ran out. The major part of the French army was therefore withdrawn, and Charles of Blois was left to pursue his claim on his own. Charles soon proved himself to be an able soldier: Rennes and Vannes were taken and many of the Montfortist captains defected.

In late November, Edward III arrived with his army at Brest. He almost at once marched against Vannes. The siege dragged on and a French army was assembled to meet him, but on 19 January 1343, before any major engagements could be fought, the two kings agreed the Truce of Malestroit. Vannes was taken into papal custody. With John of Montfort in prison, his son an infant, and his wife recently gone mad, the places under Montfortist control were in practice administered from London, with a large permanent English garrison at Brest.

The truce was to last until 29 September 1346 with the hopes that in the meantime the disputes between the two kingdoms could be permanently settled, but in Brittany it made little difference. The truce bound the two kings and their followers, but Charles of Blois claimed to be fighting his own separate war and was therefore not bound by any truce. The brutal small-scale fighting continued at the same pace.

In Paris, John of Montfort was released from prison on 1 September 1343 in return for a huge bond and a promise to stay on his estates in the east. The English coastal garrisons held firm, but the Montfortist party continued to crumble. They had some successes, such as the expulsion of the papal custodians from Vannes, but with no unifying leadership, mostly they were reduced to pleading for men and money from London.

To hamper communication between Brest and Vannes, Charles of Blois laid siege to Quimper in early March 1344. The city fell by assault on 1 May and, as usual at that time, this meant the slaughter of civilians in huge numbers, estimated between 1,400 and 2,000. The English prisoners were held for ransom, but the Breton and Norman captives were dispatched to Paris where they were executed for treason. During the summer and autumn, the Montfortist party fell apart. Even those who had been John of Montfort&#x27;s staunchest allies now considered it futile to continue the struggle. It, therefore, mattered little that in March 1345 John finally managed to escape to England. With no adherents of note of his own, he was now little more than a figurehead for English ambitions in Brittany.

Edward III decided to repudiate the truce in summer 1345, a year before it was due to run out. As part of his larger strategy, a force was dispatched to Brittany under the joint leadership of the Earl of Northampton and John of Montfort. Within a week of their landing in June, the English had their first victory when Sir Thomas Dagworth, one of Northampton&#x27;s lieutenants, raided central Brittany and defeated Charles of Blois at Cadoret near Josselin.

The follow-up was less impressive. Further operations were delayed until July when Montfort attempted the recapture of Quimper. However, news had reached the French government that Edward&#x27;s main campaign had been canceled and they were able to send reinforcements from Normandy. With his strengthened army, Charles of Blois broke the siege. Routed, Montfort fled back to Hennebont where he fell ill and died on 16 September. The heir to the Montfortist cause was his five-year-old son, John.

During the winter, Northampton fought a long and hard campaign with the apparent objective of seizing a harbour on the north side of the peninsula. Edward III had probably planned to land here with his main force during summer 1346. However, the English achieved very little for their efforts. Northern Brittany was Joan of Penthièvre&#x27;s home region and resistance there was stiff.

In the end, Edward decided upon Normandy as the landing spot for his 1346 campaign. Northampton was recalled and Thomas Dagworth was appointed as deputy lieutenant. It was during a tour through the English strongholds on 9 June that Dagworth and his escort were trapped by Charles of Blois and his army near Saint-Pol-de-Léon. They dug in on a hilltop and fought off all attacks until nightfall when Charles was forced to retreat leaving many of his wounded behind.

==Tide turns against Charles==

At this point events outside Brittany started to have an effect on the war. The French suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Crécy in 1346, and at Calais in 1347. Without French support, Charles of Blois gradually began to lose ground to the English captains. The memory of the massacre at Quimper increased his unpopularity, and Breton traders had an economic interest in strengthening links with England due to Brittany&#x27;s strategic position between the Atlantic and English Channel. At the Battle of La Roche-Derrien in 1347, Charles was taken prisoner as he tried to recapture the town, which had just been taken by the English. He was jailed for five years in the Tower of London. The English now controlled Brest, Quimper, and Vannes.

Under pressure from Pope Innocent VI, the English, French, and Bretons negotiated a peace, while both factions maintained an uneasy balance of power within the duchy. It was during this period that the Combat of the Thirty took place, a famous episode in medieval chivalry. Conflicts between the French and English strongholds of Josselin and Ploërmel were resolved in a duel between thirty Montfortist knights led by Robert Bemborough, and thirty supporters of Charles de Blois led by Jean de Beaumanoir. The combat took place midway between the two towns on 26 March 1351. By nightfall the Anglo-Breton Montfortists had lost nine dead against six of the pro-French knights; the surviving Montfortists were forced to surrender. Though renowned at the time, and later highly romanticised, the combat had no effect on the outcome of the war.

Edward III signed the Treaty of Westminster on 1 March 1353, accepting Charles of Blois as Duke of Brittany if the latter undertook to pay a ransom of 300,000 crowns, and that Brittany signed a treaty of alliance &quot;in perpetuity&quot; with England; this alliance was to be sealed by the marriage of the Montfortist claimant John of Montfort (son of the earlier John of Montfort) with Edward&#x27;s daughter Mary. The marriage required the approval of the King of France and a papal dispensation. Charles de la Cerda, the Constable of France, negotiated the deal, but Charles II of Navarre, who needed to continue the war between England and France to maintain his own power, decided to intervene by assassinating the Constable. He then switched his support to France in exchange for territory. The treaty was negated, but Charles of Blois had been freed, and returned to Brittany as Duke.

==Final phase==

The situation remained in stalemate for some time, with Charles of Blois as &quot;de facto&quot; Duke, but with significant territory still controlled by the Montfortists. Outside events again began to have an effect on the conflict. A plague struck France and the King himself was captured by the English at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. The French state was virtually paralysed. In 1362, when the younger John de Montfort reached 22 years of age, King Edward permitted him to return to Brittany. His return was conditioned by a covenant not to marry without permission, given in pledge of several fortresses. On arrival, John attempted to reach agreement with Charles of Blois to make peace and share Brittany, but Charles&#x27;s wife Joan urged him to resist and crush John.

The war resumed in 1363 when Charles de Blois, assisted by Bertrand du Guesclin, had some successes, but when Bertrand left to take control of strongholds in Navarre and Normandy, Charles&#x27;s advance halted at the unsuccessful siege of Bécherel. Another opportunity to negotiate an agreement arose, but again Joan blocked negotiations. John de Montfort moved to besiege Auray with renowned English warlord John Chandos. Charles of Blois and Bertrand du Guesclin came to the rescue of the besieged city, but they were decisively defeated at the Battle of Auray on 29 September 1364. This battle marked the end of this long conflict: Charles of Blois was killed and Joan of Penthièvre, finding herself a widow, saw her cause collapse. Du Guesclin was captured and ransomed by Charles V for 100,000 francs.

==Peace treaty==
Peace was concluded on 12 April 1365 by the First Treaty of Guérande which established John of Montfort as Duke of Brittany. He did not reject completely the claims of the Penthièvre family, and established the following law of succession in Brittany:

* The Duchy would be transmitted from male to male in the family of Montfort;
* In the absence of male offspring, it would switch to males of the family of Penthièvre;
* Joan retained the prerogative of Penthièvre and the Viscouncy of Limoges.
* She would also receive 10,000 livres of annual rent taken from the French territories of the enemy.

King Charles V of France did not oppose the elevation of John, fearing that he might declare homage to Edward of England, his protector and former father-in-law (Mary having died in 1361). In addition, France was clearly depleted in the context of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He therefore recognized John as Duke. By this action, he won the friendship of the Breton nobility. In December 1366, he received the oath of the new duke who surprisingly did not pledge allegiance to Edward, recognizing Charles as his sovereign instead.

The provisions of the treaty were later repudiated by the Montfortists when a later Duke, John V, Duke of Brittany was kidnapped by the Penthièvres in 1420, in violation of the treaty. The Montfortists declared that the treaty had been broken, and as such were no longer required to accept its succession provisions. This became significant when Francis II, Duke of Brittany failed to produce a male heir, allowing the duchy to pass to his daughter Anne of Brittany in 1488.

==Chronology==
* 30 April 1341 – John III dies without heirs. Joan of Penthièvre and Charles of Blois became Duchess and Duke of Brittany. John of Montfort refuses to accept and calls for the help of King Edward III of England.
* 1343 – John of Montfort is taken prisoner, but is released shortly afterwards. Charles tries to take advantage and attacks Hennebont, but the city is defended with success by Joanna of Flanders, wife of Montfort. An English army relieves the siege and forces the Blois to a truce, broken shortly afterwards.
* 1344 – Charles takes Quimper with the help of a French army, courtesy of King Philip VI of France, and slaughters 2000 civilians.
* 1345 – John of Montfort fails to recover Quimper and dies. His ambitions over Brittany are inherited by his son John. His mother, Joanna of Flanders, becomes the political and military commander of the Montfort faction.
* Between 1346 and 1364, several minor battles are won and lost by both parts, several truces are signed and broken. Joanna of Flanders becomes mentally ill and is institutionalized in a convent.
** 27 March 1351 – Combat of the Thirty
* 29 September 1364 – Battle of Auray. Bertrand du Guesclin and Charles of Blois are heavily defeated by John IV and the English warlord John Chandos. Charles is killed in action, ending the Blois pretensions in Brittany.
* 1365 – John IV is recognized as Duke of Brittany and Joan of Penthièvre gives up any claim to the duchy in the Treaty of Guérande. Surprisingly, the new duke declares himself as a vassal, not to the English king who helped him, but to King Charles V of France.

<doc id="640286" wikidata="Q2708520" url="?curid=640286" title="Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party">
<text>The chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party () was the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. The position was established at the 8th National Congress in 1945 and abolished at the 12th National Congress in 1982, being replaced by the general secretary. Offices with the name Chairman of the Central Executive Committee and Chairman of the Central Committee existed in 1922–1923 and 1928–1931, respectively.

==History==
=== Background ===
Following the establishment of the CCP, its inaugural leader, Chen Duxiu, held various positions including secretary of the Central Bureau, chairman of the Central Executive Committee (), and general secretary of the Central Committee. From January 11 to 22, 1925, the 4th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party issued 11 resolutions, including modifications to the CCP constitution, to succinctly encapsulate the revolutionary experiences acquired during the First United Front. The Chairman of the Central Executive Committee was reappointed as General Secretary, and Chen Duxiu was elected as General Secretary of the Central Committee and Director of the Central Organization Department.

In June 1935, during the Red Army&#x27;s Long March, a debate emerged on the army&#x27;s subsequent path of march after the and the convened in Maogong. Mao Zedong directed a segment of the Red First Front Army northward to Shaanxi, whereas Zhang Guotao commanded the Red Fourth Front Army southward to Sichuan. On October 5, 1935, Zhang Guotao established a distinct &quot;Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party&quot; (historically referred to as the &quot;Second Central Committee&quot;) in Zhuomudiao, Markang County, Sichuan. Zhang Guotao was designated as the &quot;Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party&quot;, marking the initial appearance of the title &quot;Central Committee Chairman&quot; within the CCP. However, under the influence of the Communist International (Comintern) and the CCP&#x27;s Central Committee, Zhang Guotao was compelled to dissolve his &quot;Second Central Committee&quot;. On June 6, 1936, Zhang Guotao officially declared the dissolution of the &quot;Second Central Committee&quot; and his resignation as &quot;Party Chairman&quot;, a position that was not formally acknowledged by the CCP. Mao Zedong was the inaugural Chairman of the Central Committee acknowledged by the CCP.

=== Establishment ===

To prevent further division within the CCP, the Politburo convened on March 20, 1943, and resolved that the Secretariat would consist of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and Ren Bishi, with Mao Zedong serving as the chairman of both the Politburo and the Secretariat, in addition to leading the Central Party School. As his replacement, Mao Zedong, who had been the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the party since the Long March, was named Chairman of the Politburo of the CCP Central Committee (). The 7th CCP National Congress introduced the post of Chairman of the Central Committee into the party constitution, and in 1956 the General Secretary was given the day-to-day management of the Secretariat.

The chairman was elected by the Central Committee in a plenary session and had full powers over the Central Committee, the Politburo, and its Standing Committee. The 1956 Party Constitution introduced the multiple vice chairman post; since 1945, actual vice chairmanship had been exercised by the Secretariat members. Liu Shaoqi was the highest-ranking vice-chairman from 1956 to 1966.

The 1969 CCP Constitution (adopted by the 9th Congress) introduced the post of a single vice chairman, in order to give more authority to Lin Biao as Mao&#x27;s successor. The 1973 Constitution (adopted by the 10th Congress) re-introduced the collective vice chairmanship. In 1976, Hua Guofeng was named the first vice chairman of the Central Committee, a post previously held unofficially by Liu Shaoqi from 1956 to 1966; Zhou Enlai from 1973 to 1975; and Deng Xiaoping in 1975 in the capacity of &quot;Vice Chairman in charge of the day-to-day work of the Central Committee&quot;.

The 1975 constitution reinforced the influence of the party on the state. The National Defense Council was abolished. Article 15 made the Chairman the commander-in-chief of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (&quot;the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party leads all the armed forces of the country&quot;).

=== Abolishment ===

Although Hua Guofeng succeeded Mao as party chairman, by 1978 he had lost power to vice chairman Deng Xiaoping, who at that point had become the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of China. By the 1980s, the CCP leadership desired to prevent a single leader from rising above the party, as Mao had done.

On September 1, 1982, the CCP convened its Twelfth Congress, during which it resolved to amend the CCP Constitution to eliminate the position of Chairman of the Central Committee, retaining only the role of General Secretary of the Central Committee. It established that the responsibilities of the General Secretary would include convening meetings of the Politburo of the Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the Politburo, as well as presiding over the operations of the Central Committee Secretariat. The party&#x27;s last chairman, Hu Yaobang, transferred to the post of General Secretary.

<doc id="640290" wikidata="Q948919" url="?curid=640290" title="Paradoxical reaction">
<text>A paradoxical reaction (or paradoxical effect) is an effect of a chemical substance, such as a medical drug, that is opposite to what would usually be expected. An example of a paradoxical reaction is pain caused by a pain relief medication.

==Substances==
===Amphetamines===
Amphetamines are a class of psychoactive drugs that are stimulants. Paradoxical drowsiness can sometimes occur in adults. Research from the 1980s popularized the belief that ADHD stimulants such as amphetamine have a calming effect in individuals with ADHD, but opposite effects in the general population. Research in the early 2000s, however, disputes this claim, suggesting that ADHD stimulants have similar effects in adults with and without ADHD.

===Antibiotics===
The paradoxical effect or Eagle effect (named after Harry Eagle, who first described it) refers to an observation of an increase in survivors, seen when testing the activity of an antimicrobial agent. Initially when an antibiotic agent is added to a culture media, the number of bacteria that survive drops, as one would expect. But after increasing the concentration beyond a certain point, the number of bacteria that survive, paradoxically, increases.

===Antidepressants===
In a minority of cases, antidepressants can lead to violent thoughts of suicide or self-harm, as observed in some patients during and after treatment, which is in marked contrast to their intended effect. A 1991 study found that children and adolescents were more sensitive to paradoxical reactions of self-harm and suicidal ideation while taking fluoxetine (commonly known as Prozac). This can be regarded as a paradoxical reaction but, especially in the case of suicide, may in at least some cases be merely due to differing rates of effect with respect to different symptoms of depression: If generalized overinhibition of a patient&#x27;s actions enters remission before that patient&#x27;s dysphoria does and if the patient was already suicidal but too depressed to act on their inclinations, the patient may find themself in the situation of being both still dysphoric enough to want to commit suicide but newly free of endogenous barriers against doing so.

===Antipsychotics===
Chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic and antiemetic drug which is classed as a &quot;major&quot; tranquilizer, may cause paradoxical effects such as agitation, hallucinations, excitement, insomnia, bizarre dreams, aggravation of psychotic symptoms and toxic confusional states.

These may be more common in elderly dementia patients. The apparent worsening of dementia may be due to the anticholinergic side effects of many antipsychotics.

===Barbiturates===
Phenobarbital can cause hyperactivity in children. This may follow after a small dose of 20 mg, on condition of no phenobarbital administered in previous days. Prerequisite for this reaction is a continued sense of tension. The mechanism of action is not known, but it may be started by the anxiolytic action of the phenobarbital.

Barbiturates such as pentobarbital have been shown to cause paradoxical hyperactivity in an estimated 1% of children, who display symptoms similar to the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Intravenous caffeine administration can return these patients&#x27; behavior to baseline levels. Some case reports postulate a high rate (10-20%) of paradoxical response to anesthesia in ADHD patients, though this has not been objectively corroborated in controlled studies.

===Benzodiazepines===
Benzodiazepines, a class of psychoactive drugs called the &quot;minor&quot; tranquilizers, have varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxing properties, but they may create the exact opposite effects. Susceptible individuals may respond to benzodiazepine treatment with an increase in anxiety, aggressiveness, agitation, confusion, disinhibition, loss of impulse control, talkativeness, violent behavior, and even convulsions. Paradoxical adverse effects may even lead to criminal behavior. Severe behavioral changes resulting from benzodiazepines have been reported including mania, hypomania, psychosis, anger and impulsivity.

Paradoxical rage reactions due to benzodiazepines occur as a result of an altered level of consciousness, which generates automatic behaviors, anterograde amnesia and uninhibited aggression. These aggressive reactions may be caused by a disinhibiting serotonergic mechanism.

Paradoxical effects of benzodiazepines appear to be dose-related, that is, likelier to occur with higher doses.

In a letter to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, it was reported that a high proportion of parents referred for actual or threatened child abuse were taking medication at the time, often a combination of benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. Many mothers described that instead of feeling less anxious or depressed, they became more hostile and openly aggressive towards the child as well as to other family members while consuming tranquilizers. The author warned that environmental or social stresses such as difficulty coping with a crying baby combined with the effects of tranquilizers may precipitate a child abuse event.

Self-aggression has been reported and also demonstrated in laboratory conditions in a clinical study. Diazepam was found to increase people&#x27;s willingness to harm themselves.

Benzodiazepines can sometimes cause a paradoxical worsening of EEG readings in patients with seizure disorders.

=== Caffeine ===
Caffeine is believed by many to cause paradoxical calmness or sedation in individuals with ADHD. There is insufficient evidence to determine if sedation caused by caffeine is due to a true paradoxical reaction, or rather from dehydration and sleep deprivation caused by the caffeine. Furthermore, there are no conclusive studies showing a differential effect of caffeine in individuals with ADHD compared to the general population. 

=== Naltrexone ===
Naltrexone blocks the opioid receptors, acting opposite to most opioid pain medications. It can be used to negate the effects of opioid painkillers. At doses around one-tenth of the typical dose, naltrexone has been used for pain relief. Low-dose naltrexone is believed to have an anti-inflammatory effect. This is an off-label use and not widely accepted by the medical and scientific community.

===Diphenhydramine===
Diphenhydramine (often referred to by the trade name Benadryl) is an anticholinergic antihistamine medicine commonly used to treat allergic reactions and symptoms of a common cold, such as coughing. Its central antihistaminergic properties also cause it to act as a sedative, and for this reason it is also used to treat insomnia. Diphenhydramine is also used off-label for its sedative properties, particularly by parents seeking to make their children sedated or sleep during long-haul flights. This use of diphenhydramine has been criticized for a number of reasons, ranging from ethical to safety concerns, but also due to the risk of diphenhydramine&#x27;s paradoxical reaction, which induces hyperactivity and irritability. This phenomenon can also be observed in adults who use the medication as a sleep aid. The prevalence of this paradoxical reaction is unknown, but research into the phenomenon suggests that it may be as a result of the medicine&#x27;s interactions with the CYP2D6 enzyme, and that a metabolite of diphenhydramine may be to blame.

==Causes==

The mechanism of a paradoxical reaction has as yet (2019) not been fully clarified, in no small part due to the fact that signal transfer of single neurons in subcortical areas of the human brain is usually not accessible.

There are, however, multiple indications that paradoxical reactions upon – for example – benzodiazepines, barbiturates, inhalational anesthetics, propofol, neurosteroids, and alcohol are associated with structural deviations of GABAA receptors. The combination of the five subunits of the receptor (see image) can be altered in such a way that for example, the receptor&#x27;s response to GABA remains unchanged but the response to one of the named substances is dramatically different from the normal one.

<text>Matthew Erich &quot;Mancow&quot; Muller (born June 21, 1966) is an American radio and television personality, actor, and former child actor. Considered a shock jock, his career has been well known for controversy and clashes with the Federal Communications Commission. He is best known for &quot;Mancow&#x27;s Morning Madhouse&quot;, a Chicago-based syndicated radio show, and &quot;The Mancow Radio Experience&quot;, which have been nationally distributed by Talk Radio Network. Muller also co-starred with his brother, Mark, in the reality TV series &quot;God, Guns &amp; Automobiles&quot;, which aired on History Channel. He was the host of the morning show on WLUP-FM/97.9, before he was let go on March 6, 2018, upon WLUP-FM/97.9 being sold.

In January 2019, Muller returned to radio on WLS to host mornings, but has since been replaced.

==Early life==
Erich Muller, as he was commonly known, was born to parents John and Dawn Muller and raised in the Kansas City, Missouri area with older brothers Johnny and Mark. He expressed an interest in radio and the entertainment industry as a whole from an early age. As a child he would listen to old reel-to-reel tapes of classic radio shows like &quot;The Shadow&quot; and &quot;The Stan Freberg Show&quot; with his father. Erich Muller worked as a model and child actor, appearing in regional print and television commercials as well as Kansas City theater productions. Among his print modeling work were ads for Lee jeans and Wal-Mart.

As a youth he appeared in over 100 stage performances, with one notable long-running role being that of Billy Ray Jr. in the play &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. During one performance of the play, famous actor Henry Fonda was in the audience, and would later go on to play the lead character Norman in the film version. Erich Muller attended multiple schools in the Kansas City area, including Blue Ridge Christian School. In his book &quot;Dad, Dames, Demons, and a Dwarf: My Trip Down Freedom Road&quot;, he recounts an incident in fifth grade where, in an act of corporal punishment, he was severely beaten with a board by the school principal, an event that changed his outlook on organized religion. Muller transferred to the suburban Harrisonville school district, where he was graduated from high school.

Following high school, Muller attended college at Central Missouri State University (now University of Central Missouri) in Warrensburg, not far from the Kansas City metropolitan area. At CMSU he continued to work in theater, and it was his role as a half-man, half-beast in one production that gave rise to his nickname &quot;Mancow&quot;. Muller earned double degrees from the university in Public Relations and Theatre in 1990. To earn money while in school, he operated his own mobile DJ business, providing music for school dances, weddings, and class reunions, a job he later said he hated. It was also while in college he took his first tentative steps into broadcasting.

==Radio career beginnings==
Muller&#x27;s radio career began while he was in college. He got a job at KOKO in Warrensburg as a late night control board operator, playing local commercials during satellite broadcasts of &quot;The Larry King Show.&quot; His role at the station gradually expanded until he got his own afternoon show. Among Muller&#x27;s fans was the general manager of KLSI-FM, Kansas City, who offered him a full-time job as head of station promotions. Muller accepted the position, plus a weekend air shift, while completing his final semester at Central Missouri State. After graduating in 1990, Muller was hired as the morning drive air talent at Kansas City&#x27;s KBEQ-FM, Q-104, where the &quot;Holy Moley &amp; Maxx Show&quot; quickly rose to #1 in the ratings and helped Q-104 dominate the market.

After his early hometown success, Muller left Kansas City for a brief stint at KDON-FM in Salinas, California. Then he headed north to San Francisco and KYLD-FM, &quot;Wild 107&quot;. Now going by his old college nickname Mancow, in 1993 Muller made national headlines with a publicity stunt that caused a major traffic problem for San Francisco. Reacting to a subsequently debunked story that President Bill Clinton had tied up air traffic at Los Angeles International Airport for over an hour while getting a haircut from celebrity hairstylist Cristophe aboard Air Force One, Muller staged a parody of the incident on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge during rush hour. He used vans to block the westbound lanes on the bridge while his then-sidekick, Jesus &quot;Chuy&quot; Gomez, received a haircut. As a result of the publicity stunt, Muller was charged with creating a public nuisance. After entering a no contest plea, his sentence included three years probation, a $500 fine and 100 hours of community service. The radio station settled a civil suit by paying $1.5 million, including $500,000 to cover three toll-free days on the bridge.
===&quot;Mancow&#x27;s Morning Madhouse&quot;===

Muller accepted a job offer by Evergreen Media President Jim de Castro at more than double his salary to move to Chicago and work at &quot;Rock 103.5&quot; (WRCX). Muller&#x27;s radio show, &quot;Mancow&#x27;s Morning Madhouse&quot;, debuted in July 1994.

Originally, Muller broadcast from WRCX-FM (Rock 103.5) studios in the John Hancock Center and in 1998, moved to the city&#x27;s alternative rock station, WKQX-FM (Q-101) 101.1, where the show was broadcast from the Merchandise Mart for eight more years.

Within two Arbitron ratings periods Muller took the station&#x27;s 19th-ranked morning show to 5th-ranked among all teens and adults, and first among 18- to 34-year-olds. During his run on Q101, Mancow had a much publicized feud with fellow &quot;shock-jock&quot; Howard Stern. He also had close on and off air relationships with &quot;Crazy Howard&quot; McGee of WGCI-FM and Mike North of WSCR. McGee and Mancow&#x27;s shows ran at the same time but catered to different demographics (WGCI is an R&amp;B and hip hop station).

Muller&#x27;s &quot;Mancow&#x27;s Morning Madhouse&quot; ended its live run on Emmis&#x27; Alternative outlet in Spring 2006, and had the highest rated audience in Chicago with men ages 25 to 54 (among English speaking stations). According to the Arbitron radio ratings service, Mancow&#x27;s show, measured in Average Quarter Hour listening percentages (AQH) had a 5.7 share. The next closest station was all-news WBBM with a 5.3 share.

In his target demographic, men between the ages of 18 and 34 years, Mancow AQH was an 11.8 share of the audience in that age group, the highest share of any other Anglophonic station in Chicago.

His show, however, was not without controversy. In 1999, Janet Dahl, the wife of Chicago talk radio host Steve Dahl, filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Muller over lewd comments Muller made about her on his show. In 2001, the case was settled out of court. Although the terms of the deal were not disclosed, it reportedly reached seven figures.

Between 1999 and 2004, David Edward Smith&#x27;s Citizens for Community Values filed 66 indecency complaints with the FCC relating to Muller&#x27;s program, leading to 6 citations and $42,000 in fines. In 2004 Muller sued Smith for harassment and business interference, but later dropped the lawsuit. Emmis Communications entered into a 2004 consent decree with the FCC, agreeing to make a $300,000 &quot;voluntary payment&quot; to resolve the complaints; in 2006 (after Muller had ended his WKQX show), the FCC rejected Smith&#x27;s challenge to this settlement.

For a full week leading up to Limp Bizkit&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium 2003 concert in Chicago, Muller continually the band&#x27;s vocalist Fred Durst on his radio show and invited listeners to attend the concert with anti-Durst placards. When Muller&#x27;s fans complied by showing up with the placards, openly taunting the singer, booing him and pelting him with refuse, Durst erupted into a profanity-laced homophobic tirade and left the stage only 17 minutes into the show. Durst was eventually sued for breach of contract (for not completing the show) by Chicago lawyer Michael Young in a class-action suit.

On October 22, 2008, WLS in Chicago announced that Muller, along with Pat Cassidy, would join that station as a weekday radio talk show host, in the 9 am to 11 am time slot, beginning on October 27, 2008. Muller continued to host his nationally syndicated morning radio program. Just four months after the debut of Mancow and Cassidy, Arbitron ratings had the show at No. 1 in the 12+ audience, and nearly doubling Chicago competitors in the male demographic as of February 2009. Despite the ratings, Muller was fired from his job on news and conservative talk station WLS after only 16 months. Muller then hosted a Sunday night show on WABC from September 2010 until October 2011, when he was let go following Cumulus Media&#x27;s acquisition of WABC parent Citadel Broadcasting.

On October 22, 2012, Muller began his new show, simply titled &quot;Mancow&quot;, on WPWR-TV, a live broadcast of his radio show &quot;The Mancow Experience&quot;, with co-host Teresa Cesario. In February 2013, a program called &quot;The Mancow Mashup&quot; began airing on the network, which was a half-hour program that showed highlights from the previous morning&#x27;s Television show. The show&#x27;s last airing was October 7, 2014. On October 9, 2014, roughly a year from when the show began airing, Muller&#x27;s WPWR-TV simulcast of his radio show was confirmed cancelled after the show&#x27;s contract expired, along with &quot;The Mancow Mashup&quot;. Muller confirmed that for the first time since 1985, he will be taking a break from both TV and radio. However, Muller mentioned the possibility of other ventures, including a potential movie review show.

Muller returned to the radio on Chicago&#x27;s WLUP-FM radio station in February 2015 after winning a week-long audition for the station&#x27;s 6–10am weekday show. Muller&#x27;s show on WLUP ended on 6 March 2018 when it was announced that WLUP had been sold to Christian radio broadcaster Educational Media Foundation.

=== WLS ===
On January 3, 2019, Muller returned to WLS in Chicago after nine months off the air. Muller said his new show will focus more on news, entertainment and politics compared to his time on The Loop.

Mancow announced he is leaving his show, on November 25, 2020. 

== Cowboy Ray ==
Ray Hofstatter, aka &quot;Cowboy Ray&quot;, was a mentally challenged frequent caller and guest on &quot;Mancow&#x27;s Morning Madhouse&quot;. On November 20, 2005, Hofstatter was struck by a car in a hit-and-run accident and critically injured. Hofstatter died shortly after his life support was terminated on January 11, 2006. He was 45. Muller offered a $13,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the driver, but was unsuccessful. The hit-and-run case of Cowboy Ray was featured on the February 26, 2006 episode of Fox&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.

==Politics==
Mancow was an outspoken supporter of George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential election, asking people on the street whether they &quot;liked [George W.] Bush or liked Dick [Cheney].&quot; On December 6, 2005, Muller made an appearance on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; where he referred to Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean as &quot;vile&quot;, &quot;bloodthirsty&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. Muller also commented on Dean&#x27;s negative opinions on the War in Iraq, calling Dean a traitor who &quot;ought to be kicked out of America&quot; and &quot;tried for treason&quot;.

On May 22, 2009, Muller had himself waterboarded during his radio program on WLS, having lost a listener poll determining whether he or co-host Pat Cassidy would be the one waterboarded. The talk show host had previously claimed that calling waterboarding &quot;torture&quot; was wrong, something he had stated that he hoped his reenactment would prove. Lasting only 6 seconds (&quot;8 seconds less than the average person&quot;, according to program guest Marine Sergeant Klay South, who was the one to administer the waterboarding), Mancow afterward changed his opinion, saying, &quot;It is way worse than I thought it would be, and that&#x27;s no joke&quot;, and described waterboarding as &quot;absolutely torture&quot;.

Questions were later raised about the validity of the procedure. South had no formal training in waterboarding and had never before performed the procedure, leading the online celebrity and gossip site Gawker to accuse Muller of faking the whole thing. Muller later stated in an interview on &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, &quot;I admit it, it was a stupid radio stunt. But waterboarding, all it is, is water in your nose and mouth with your head back.&quot; Further adding &quot;We went into this thinking it was going to be a joke. But it was not a joke – it was horrible. &#x27;Hoax&#x27; is probably not the right word, but we did think it was going to be a joke.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Muller married Sandy Ferrando, a former publicist, on February 14, 2003. He has twin daughters named Ava Grace and Isabella Sofia. His father, a former traveling salesman, died of cancer at the age of 62. The event deeply affected Muller and in part prompted him to write his first book, &quot;Dad, Dames, Demons and a Dwarf&quot;.
Mancow Muller attended Harvest Bible Chapel from 2014 to 2019 and was a personal friend of pastor James MacDonald since 2016.
In November 2018 Muller travelled to Palestine with MacDonald where he baptized him in the Jordan River. Less than two months later in January 2019 and less than three weeks after starting his new radio show on WLS-Chicago, Mancow began calling MacDonald a con artist on his show and on social media sites, and asking him to resign or be removed as pastor.
Mancow has consistently criticized and accused MacDonald of crimes since January 2019, including murder-for-hire in May 2019.

<doc id="640294" wikidata="Q4729656" url="?curid=640294" title="All Souls Church, Langham Place">
<text>All Souls Church is a conservative evangelical Anglican church in central London, situated in Langham Place in Marylebone, at the north end of Regent Street. It was designed in Regency style by John Nash and consecrated in 1824.

As the church stands directly opposite Broadcasting House, the BBC often broadcasts from the church. As well as the core church membership, many hundreds of visitors come to All Souls, bringing the average number of those coming through its doors for services on Sundays to around 2,500 every week. All Souls has an international congregation, with worshippers of all ages.

== History ==

The church was designed by John Nash, favourite architect of King George IV. Its prominent circular-spired vestibule was designed as an eye-catching monument at the point where Regent Street, newly-laid out as part of Nash&#x27;s scheme to link Piccadilly with the new Regent&#x27;s Park, takes an awkward abrupt bend westward to align with the pre-existing Portland Place.

All Souls was a Commissioners&#x27; church, a grant of £12,819 (equivalent to £ in ) being given by the Church Building Commission towards the cost of its construction. The commission had been set up under Church Building Act 1818 (58 Geo. 3. c. 45), and Nash, as one of the three architects employed by the Board of Works, had been asked to supply specimen designs as soon as the act was passed. It was, however, one of only two Commissioners&#x27; churches to be built to his designs, the other being the Gothic Revival St Mary, Haggerston. All Souls is the last surviving church by John Nash.

The building was completed in December 1823 at a final cost of £18,323 10s 5d. It was consecrated &quot;with solemn grandeur&quot; on 25 November 1824 by William Howley, Bishop of London, later Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Architecture==
The church is built of Bath stone. It consists of a prominent spired circular vestibule, attached to a much more reticent main church by the width of a single intercolumniation. The idiosyncratic spire is composed of seventeen concave sides encircled by a &quot;peripteros&quot; of Corinthian columns, making two separate sections. 

Nash&#x27;s design was not met with universal praise. A reviewer for &quot;The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction&quot; 2 August 1828, wrote:
== Crown appointment ==

The Rector of All Souls Church is still appointed by the Crown Appointments Commission at 10 Downing Street. The links with the Crown date back to the time of George IV when the Crown acquired the land around the church. The Coat of Arms adorns the West Gallery.

== Post-war restoration ==
On 8 December 1940, a Luftwaffe parachute mine exploded during the Blitz, and caused some damage to the church, damaging the ceiling. Photographs of the wartime damage showed that most of the building survived, including most of the furnishings. The church was closed for some ten years while repair works were carried out. During this time, the congregation met for worship at St Peter&#x27;s, Vere Street. The building was restored and furnishings replaced by the respected architect Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel CBE, who is responsible for many celebrated church interiors, and was also responsible for the restoration and new fittings in 1923–1927. Although many furnishings survived the bombing, such as the pulpit, these, along with the rest of Goodhart-Rendel&#x27;s work was disposed of in a later renovation campaign.

== Mid-1970s building project ==

Despite only having recently been fully restored in 1951, the church was again extensively renovated and modified in 1975–1976, in an unusually invasive scheme for a Grade I listed building, under the supervision of then rector, Michael Baughen. A large basement was excavated under the church to provide a church hall and other spaces for the congregation and visitors to meet together after services and during the week. The rebuilt floor was also raised to facilitate this, resulting in the original proportions of the room being significantly changed, resulting in the current squat appearance, with very low ceilings under the galleries, and unusually low windowsills. The gallery fronts were also replaced and date from this time, and the west gallery was also extended forward, now looking rather unusually unsupported for a classical building. The then-new Waldegrave Hall was built in the typical style of the 1970s, with wall-to-wall carpeting and fluorescent lighting. It is also designed in such a way that the original brick foundations of the church are visible.

At the same time, the opportunity was taken to restructure the interior of the church to make it more suitable for then-present-day forms of worship favoured by the more evangelical wing of the Church of England in the 1970s, and no original furnishing remains apart from the organ case and the reredos. The side altar in the south aisle was also removed, and the area is now used for chair storage. At present, the body of the church is carpeted, and stackable chairs and tables are provided to enable alternative uses of the space.

==Organ and music==

All Souls is well known for its musical tradition and part of this includes the Hunter organ installed in the west gallery in a Spanish mahogany case designed by Nash. The case was enlarged and extended in 1913. In 1940, anticipating war damage to the church, the organ was dismantled and put into storage, then in 1951 remodelled and rebuilt, with a new rotatable electric manual and pedal console, and installed in the chancel by the firm of Henry Willis (IV). The organ was again rebuilt, by Harrison &amp; Harrison, during the building project of 1975–1976, when a four-manual console was added, plus a positive division and a pronounced fanfare-trumpet en-chamade. In 1933, John Ivimey was appointed as organist and Director of Music.

Musical worship mixes contemporary and traditional styles, featuring either the church&#x27;s worship band, orchestra, singing group or choir at all the main regular Sunday services, under the leadership of Michael Andrews. In 1972, the All Souls Orchestra was founded by former director of music and Emeritus Conductor, Noël Tredinnick, and has accompanied Sir Cliff Richard, Stuart Townend and other notable Christian artists. The orchestra and a massed choir perform annually at the Royal Albert Hall for the All Souls &quot;Prom Praise&quot; concert, which also tours across the UK and internationally. &quot;Prom Praise for Schools&quot; is sometimes held alongside Prom Praise, providing children from across the Diocese of London the chance to sing with the All Souls Orchestra. In 2012, the All Souls Orchestra celebrated its 40th anniversary, alongside special guests including Graham Kendrick, Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty, and Jonathan Veira.

==Present day==
All Souls celebrates four services each Sunday, with an early morning Holy Communion service at 8:00 am, followed by two other services at 9:30 am and 11:30 am and an evening service at 5:30 pm. There is also a midweek service on Thursdays during term time at 1:05 pm.

Sermons from Sunday services are uploaded for free streaming and download by the following Monday afternoon. The archive now contains over 3,000 sermons.

The church stands in the conservative evangelical tradition of the Church of England. As it rejects the ordination/leadership of women, it receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Ebbsfleet (currently Rob Munro).

== Clergy ==

The current rector is the Revd Charlie Skrine who was installed on 28 April 2021.

One of the church&#x27;s most notable clerics was John Stott CBE, who was associated with All Souls for his entire ministry and virtually all his life. The author of more than fifty Christian books, Stott was regarded as an important theologian and leader of the evangelical movement during the 20th century. Stott was a curate at All Souls 1945–1950 and rector 1950–1975. He resigned as rector in 1975 to pursue his wider ministry, but maintained his involvement with the church and was given the title of Rector Emeritus, which he held until his death in 2011. Stott&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; described him as &quot;An architect of 20th-century evangelicalism [who] shaped the faith of a generation.&quot;

The Revd Richard Bewes was rector from 1983 until his retirement in 2004. He was awarded an OBE for services to the Church of England. The Revd Hugh Palmer was rector from 2005 until his retirement in 2020. From July 2012 he was also a chaplain to the Queen.

Other notable former clergy include Rico Tice, who developed the Christianity Explored course; an introduction to Christian beliefs based on the Gospel of Mark and influenced by the conservative evangelical tradition.

<doc id="640300" wikidata="Q542059" url="?curid=640300" title="Alphonse Milne-Edwards">
<text>Alphonse Milne-Edwards (Paris, 13 October 1835 – Paris, 21 April 1900) was a French mammalogist, ornithologist, and carcinologist. He was English in origin, the son of Henri Milne-Edwards and grandson of Bryan Edwards, a Jamaican planter who settled at Bruges (then in France).

Milne-Edwards obtained a medical degree in 1859 and became assistant to his father at the &quot;&quot; in 1876. He became the director of the in 1891, devoting himself especially to fossil birds and deep-sea exploration. In 1881, he undertook a survey of the Gulf of Gascony with Léopold de Folin and worked aboard the &quot;Travailleur&quot; and the &quot;Talisman,&quot; researching the seas off the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Islands, and the Azores. For this, he received a gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society.

His major ornithological works include &#x27; published in two parts in 1867 and 1872,&#x27; 1866–1874 and &#x27; 1868–1874. His study of fossils led to the discovery of tropical birds such as [[trogon]]s and [[parrot]]s from prehistoric France. He worked with [[Alfred Grandidier]] on&#x27;.

Milne-Edwards also described at least one plant taxon; a species of gutta-percha collected from the island of Grande Comore, Comoros, by ornithologist Léon Humblot, which Milne-Edwards named &quot;Isonandra gutta&quot;. (&quot;I. gutta&quot; is now considered to be a taxonomic synonym of &quot;Palaquium gutta&quot; , and a homonym of its basionym &quot;Isonandra gutta&quot; .)

In 1879, Milne-Edwards was the first to describe the giant isopod &quot;Bathynomus Giganteus&quot; in the Scientific journal &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences.&quot; 

A subspecies of Central American lizard, &quot;Holcosus festivus edwardsii&quot; , is named in honor of Milne-Edwards.

<text>John Davenport (April 9, 1597May 30, 1670) was an English Puritan clergyman and co-founder of the American colony of New Haven.

==Early life==

Born in Coventry, Warwickshire, England to a wealthy family, Davenport was educated at Oxford University. He matriculated at Merton College in 1613 but migrated to Magdalen Hall two years later, probably because of its reputation at the time for its Calvinist and Puritan sympathies. However, Davenport did not complete his degree during this time, returning to Oxford in 1625 when he took the degrees of BD and MA.

His father was Henry Davenport (1567 – May 29, 1627), draper, alderman, and mayor of Coventry, son of Edward Davenport, mayor of Coventry (1551-2). His mother was Winifred Barnaby (1569 - April 12, 1597).

His brother was the Catholic theologian Francis Davenport, chaplain to Queens Catherine of Braganza and Henrietta Maria de Bourbon.

==Career==
After serving as chaplain of Hilton Castle, he became curate of St Lawrence Jewry in London. In 1624, he was chosen vicar of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, in Coleman Street, London. He became an associate of John Preston, a leading Puritan teacher and scholar, and edited his works for posthumous publication. His efforts to organize the re-purchase of &quot;lay-impropriations&quot; for the support of rural clergy were frustrated by Bishop William Laud and condemned by the Court of Exchequer, as were also his efforts for the relief of Reformed clergy displaced by war in the Electorate of the Palatinate. In 1633 he resigned from the established church to become a Nonconformist pastor and moved to Holland.

In 1637, he acquired the patent for a colony in Massachusetts and sailed with much of his congregation for Boston. While staying in Boston with Reverend John Cotton in March 1638, he sat during the church trial of Anne Hutchinson which resulted in her excommunication from the Boston church, ending the Antinomian Controversy. Later that month he co-founded the Colony of New Haven along with his classmate, Theophilus Eaton, a wealthy merchant from London who became the colony&#x27;s first governor. He was a large proponent of education in his colony and is often credited with the co-founding of Hopkins School. As a burgess, he was an important figure in the colony up until his departure to Boston in 1668. He unsuccessfully opposed the incorporation of the New Haven colony into the reorganized colony of Connecticut under a royal charter in 1667.

Davenport was a lifelong advocate of the rigorous Puritan standards for church membership and for the strict qualifications for infant baptism, which he believed should be administered only to the children of full church members. His time in Holland had been disrupted by a controversy with his supervising pastor John Paget over this issue, and it led to his withdrawal from the Puritan church in Amsterdam. In New England, he was a staunch opponent of the recommendations made by the Synod of 1662, known as the Half-Way Covenant, which proposed that the children of &quot;half-way&quot; members (those who had been baptized as infants but who had not given evidence of a &quot;conversion&quot; and been admitted to full membership) be allowed to receive baptism.

In September 1667, after the death of their pastor, John Wilson, the First Church in Boston invited Davenport to be their new pastor. A minority in that church opposed the invitation, objecting to his rejection of the compromise on infant baptism. Convention required that Davenport secure a release from his former congregation before accepting a new post, and the church in New Haven was reluctant to let him go. Still, he moved to Boston in the spring of 1668, and eventually produced excerpts of a letter from the New Haven church that appeared to grant his release. He was installed as pastor of the First Church in December 1668, but a faction opposed to his appointment sought to withdraw from the church to form a new congregation. A council of clergy from local churches endorsed their request, and they formed the Third (or Old South) Church in May 1669. On May 19, 1669, Davenport preached the Election Sermon before the General Court in Boston, using the occasion to condemn the actions of &quot;Councils&quot; that interfered with the liberty and administration of individual congregations. Perhaps instigated by this sermon, the Deputies (the lower house of the General Court) named a commission to investigate the actions of the founders of the Third Church and the ministers who had endorsed the separation. However, the Assistants (the upper house) blocked any action, including the publication of Davenport&#x27;s sermon at public expense. Later that summer, it was discovered that the release letter from New Haven had been severely redacted to give an impression that was not perhaps warranted, though Davenport&#x27;s First Church rejected charges that they had been misrepresented.
Davenport&#x27;s appointment to the leading church in New England and his inflammatory election sermon brought to a head the simmering disagreements over the compromise settlement of the Half-way Synod. But Davenport died the following year; Increase Mather, the other leading Anti-Synodist, experienced a change of heart; and Synodist deputies swept the election of 1671, ending the temporary crisis.

Davenport died in Boston of apoplexy on March 15, 1670, and was buried in the same tomb as John Cotton in King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground, Boston.

==Legacy==

Yale University was envisioned by Davenport, although his proposal for it would not be realized until some 30 years after his death. Davenport College is named in his honor and an oil portrait of him (above) is in the Yale collection. He was also instrumental in the founding of Hopkins School, a grammar school, in 1660.

Notable descendants include James Davenport (clergyman); Abraham Davenport (of John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s &quot;&quot; poem); brothers John and James Davenport, who were Congressmen; ; Archibald Cox, the Watergate Special Prosecutor; and Maxwell Perkins, the editor.

<text>Sortavala (; Finnish and ; ), previously known as Serdobol () until 1918, is a town in the Republic of Karelia, Russia, located at the northern tip of Lake Ladoga near the Finnish border, west of Petrozavodsk, the capital city of the Republic of Karelia. The closest city on the Finnish side of the border is Joensuu, which is located from Sortavala. In 2021, the population of Sortavala was 19,215.

==History==
The district of Sortavala was first recorded in Swedish documents dating to 1468. Russian documents first mention it as Serdovol or Serdobol in 1500. It was ceded to Sweden after the Ingrian War.

With the 1721 Treaty of Nystad, the settlement was joined to Russia along with the rest of Old Finland and was given the Russian name Serdobol. It became known for its marble and granite quarries which provided materials necessary for construction of imperial palaces in St. Petersburg and its neighborhood. In 1812, along with the rest of Viipuri Province, it was joined to the newly formed Grand Duchy of Finland.

In 1917, the town remained a part of independent Finland. It suffered extensively from mass Soviet bombardment during the Winter War, and through the Moscow Peace Treaty Finland was forced to cede the town to the Soviet Union. All of the population of the town was evacuated for the first time. Like the rest of Finnish Karelia, Sortavala was retaken by Finland during 1941–1944 (the period of the Continuation War) and most evacuees returned to rebuild their homes. However, after the armistice of 1944, the Finns were evacuated again and the town was ceded back empty of population. After the war, the town was resettled by the Russian and Karelian population.

Until 1940, the Ladoga shore southwest of Sortavala had been one of the very few relatively densely populated areas north of the Karelian Isthmus populated by Karelians.

<doc id="640348" wikidata="Q842328" url="?curid=640348" title="Sangiran">
<text>Sangiran is an archaeological excavation site in Java in Indonesia. According to a UNESCO report (1995) &quot;Sangiran is recognized by scientists to be one of the most important sites in the world for studying fossil man, ranking alongside Zhoukoudian (China), Willandra Lakes (Australia), Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania), and Sterkfontein (South Africa), and more fruitful in finds than any of these.&quot;

The area comprises about 56 km2 (7 km x 8 km). It is located in Central Java, about 15 kilometers north of Surakarta in the Solo River valley. Administratively, Sangiran area is divided between 2 regencies: Sragen (districts of Gemolong, Kalijambe, and Plupuh) and Karanganyar (district of Gondangrejo). An important feature of the site is the geology of the area. Originally a dome was created millions of years ago through tectonic uplifts. The dome was then eroded exposing beds within the dome which are rich in archeological records.

==History==
* 1883: The Dutch paleoanthropologist Eugène Dubois undertook preliminary fieldwork at Sangiran. However, Dubois did not find many fossils of interest so he shifted his attention to Trinil in East Java where he found significant discoveries.
* 1934: The anthropologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald started to examine the area. During excavations in the next years fossils of some of the first known human ancestors, &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; (&quot;Java Man&quot;, now reclassified as part of the species &quot;Homo erectus&quot;), were found here. About 60 more human fossils, among them the enigmatic &quot;Meganthropus&quot;, have since been found. Sangiran 2, for example, was discovered by von Koenigswald at the site. In addition, there are considerable numbers of remains of the animals that these primitive humans hunted, and of others that merely shared the habitat. 
* 1977: The Indonesian Government designated an area of 56 km2 around Sangiran as a &quot;Daerah Cagar Budaya&quot; (Protected Cultural Area).
* 1988: A modest local site museum and conservation laboratory were set up at Sangiran.
* 1996: UNESCO registered Sangiran as a World Heritage Site on the &quot;World Heritage List&quot; as the Sangiran Early Man Site.
*2011: The current museum and visitors&#x27; centre was opened by the Minister for Education and Culture on 15 December.
*2012: President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited the museum in February accompanied by 11 cabinet ministers.

Over time, following the initial work by Dubois and von Koenigswald at Sangiran, other scholars including Indonesian archeologists undertook work at the site. Indonesian scholars included Teuku Jacob, Etty Indriati, Sartono, Fachroel Aziz, Harry Widianto, Yahdi Zaim, and Johan Arif.

==Sangiran museum==

A modest museum existed at Sangiran for several decades before a modern, well-functioning museum and visitors&#x27; centre was opened in December 2011. The new building, a modern museum, contains three main halls with extensive displays and impressive dioramas of the Sangiran area as it was believed to be around 1 million years ago. Several other centres are under construction as well (early 2013) so that by 2014 it is expected that there will be four centres at different places within the overall Sangiran site. The four planned centres are:

* Krikilan: the existing site with the main visitors centre and museum.
* Ngebung: to contain a history of the discovery of the Sangiran site.
* Bukuran: to provide information about the discovery of prehistoric human fossils at Sangiran.
* Dayu: to present information about the latest research.

The current museum and visitors&#x27; centre has three main halls. The first hall contains several dioramas that provide information about the early humans and animals which existed at the Sangiran site around 1 million years ago. The second hall, which is more extensive, presents much detailed material about the wide variety of fossils found at Sangiran and about the history of exploration at the site. The third hall, in a separate impressive presentation, contains a large diorama which provides a sweeping view of the overall area of Sangiran, with volcanoes such as Mount Lawu in the background and humans and animals in the foreground, as it is imagined to have been around 1 million years ago. Several of the presentations in this third hall draw on the work of the internationally known paleontological sculptor Elisabeth Daynes.

==Access==
Access to the Sangiran museum is gained by travelling around 15 km north from Surakarta along the main road towards the central Java town of Purwodadi. The turnoff to the museum, just past the small market town of Kalioso, leads along a sealed road that winds through a relatively poor rural area for around 4 km before reaching the final short entry road to the visitors centre to the right. Total travel time from Surakarta, depending on traffic conditions along the crowded Surakarta-Purwodadi road, is about 45-60 mins. There are frequent buses along the route from Surakarta to Purwodadi which will drop passengers off at the turnoff on request. Local informal motorcycle taxi drivers will ferry visitors along the remaining 4 km for a modest charge. The museum can be reached conveniently by Trans-Java Toll Road. (The museum is open from 8.00am to 4.00pm each day except for Mondays when the museum is closed.)

==Social and other issues==
Development of the overall Sangiran site has not been without controversy. Uncontrolled digging and illegal trade in fossils have occurred on various occasions since the site was first discovered. For a considerable period, villagers in the area frequently dug up and sold fossils to local buyers. Following the enactment of National Law No. 5 of 1992 on cultural heritage objects, there were stronger controls on these activities. However, illegal activities have sometimes continued to occur in recent years. In 2010, for example, an American citizen claiming to be a scientist was arrested near Sangiran while travelling in a truck containing 43 different types of fossils in boxes and sacks with an estimated market value of $2 million.

More recently, there has been discussion in the Indonesian media about the way that the development of the Sangiran site has failed to bring any significant tangible benefits to the rural communities in the local area.

<doc id="640350" wikidata="Q4787912" url="?curid=640350" title="Arden, Warwickshire">
<text>The Forest of Arden is a territory and cultural reference point in the English West Midlands, that in antiquity and into the Early Modern Period covered much of that district: &#x27;This great forest once extended across a wide band of Middle England, as far as the River Trent in the north and the River Severn in the south&#x27;. It thus included much of Warwickshire, and parts of Shropshire, Staffordshire, the West Midlands, and Worcestershire. It is associated with William Shakespeare and is the setting of some of his dramas. The &#x27;forest&#x27; did not necessarily denote continuous woodland, &quot;but a large predominantly wooded area with many clearings and areas of cultivation&quot;.

The Forest of Arden area may be said to fall within the Roman roads which bounded the territory within: in the east by Icknield Street, in the south by the Salt Road (the modern Alcester to Stratford Road), in the south east by the Fosse Way, and in the north and west by Watling Street. The Gough Map shows this traditional extent of the forest.

More recently the shorter term &quot;Arden&quot; has been used to describe a smaller area primarily concentrated in the historic county of Warwickshire and parts of the modern West Midlands metropolitan county.

==History==

===Early history===

Believed to be derived from a Brythonic word &quot;ardu&quot;- &quot;high&quot; (cf. ), by extension &quot;highland&quot;, the area was formerly thickly forested and known as the Forest of Arden. Located near the geographical centre of England, the Forest of Arden, through which no Roman roads were built, was bounded by the Roman roads Icknield Street, Watling Street, Fosse Way, and a prehistoric salt track leading from Droitwich. It included the north-western half of the traditional county of Warwick, stretching from Stratford-upon-Avon in the south to Tamworth in the north, and as well as areas that are now the large settlements of Birmingham, Coventry and Shrewsbury, in addition to areas that are still largely rural with numerous areas of woodland. A significant settlement in the forest was the town Henley-in-Arden (in a valley of the River Alne, approximately 15 miles southeast of Birmingham), the site of an Iron Age hillfort. 

Wide lands in this district were held in the time of Edward the Confessor by Alwin, whose son Thurkill of &quot;of Arden,&quot; founded the family of this name. The Domesday book reveals that in 1086 the Forest of Arden was comparatively lightly settled, and poor in terms of agricultural wealth. 

An ancient mark stone known as Coughton Cross is still present at the southwestern corner of the forest, at the junction of Icknield Street (now A435) and the salt track, now the southern end of the frontage of Coughton Court, and is owned by the National Trust. According to local tradition, travellers prayed here for safe passage through the forest.

Thorkell of Arden, a descendant of the ruling family of Mercia, was one of the few major English landowners who retained extensive properties after the Norman conquest. His progeny, the Arden family, remained prominent in the area for centuries, by the 14th century, under Sir Henry de Arden, the most prominent Ardens had their primary estate at Park Hall, Castle Bromwich, Solihull. Connection to this ancient family was important in the identity work of the Dudley family in the sixteenth century.

Mary Arden, mother of William Shakespeare, was a member of this prominent West Midlands family, who had also had a prominent centre of power in Stockport in the 1500s.

From around 1162, until the suppression of their order in 1312, the Knights Templar owned a preceptory at Temple Balsall in the middle of the Forest of Arden. The property then passed to the Knights Hospitaller, who held it until the Reformation during the 16th century.

During the medieval era it is believed the forest began to become enclosed and deforested.

===Early modern period===
Robert Catesby, leader of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, was a native of Lapworth, a village in Arden. It is believed that many local families across the Arden area had resisted the Reformation and retained Catholic sympathies, possibly including the family of Shakespeare, whose paternal ancestors were from the Balsall area.

Many of the key engagements of English Civil War of 1642 – 1651 were fought in the Arden area, such as the Battle of Camp Hill.

==Culture and cultural references==
=== Shakespeare ===

Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like It&quot; is set in the Forest of Arden, but it is an imaginary version incorporating elements from the Ardennes forest in Thomas Lodge&#x27;s prose romance &quot;Rosalynde; Or, Euphues&#x27; Golden Legacy&quot; and the real forest (both as it was when the play was written, i.e. subjected to deforestation and enclosure, and the romanticized version of his youth). Lodge was familiar with the English Forest of Arden via the ownership and occupation by the family of the manor Soulton by his father, Sir Thomas Lodge. 

This manor is located on the boundaries of the English Forest of Arden in a territory in which the Tudor Statesman Sir Rowland Hill was active, furnishing a possible inspiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s character Old Sir Rowland. 

Shakespeare&#x27;s Arden seems to have promulgated a vision of the forest that fits in with the English nostalgic autostereotype of Merry England, and inspired subsequent artists such as Pre-Raphaelite John Collier.

=== Myths and legends ===
The status of Coventry as an isolated settlement surrounded by the thick Forest of Arden has been cited by some historians as a cause for the prospering of a cult of the pagan goddess Cofa after the rest of the country had been Christianised. 

It is believed that in the 12th century, this localised cult had transferred its veneration from the goddess Cofa to Lady Godiva, an Anglo Saxon Countess of the area. The warping of the myths with the real historical figure of Godiva, could explain many of the legends associated with her.

According to the legend, the hero Sir Guy of Warwick set up his hermitage at Guy&#x27;s Cliffe in the Forest of Arden, overlooking the River Avon.

=== In other fiction ===
Moseley Bog is a remnant of the Forest of Arden, now a local nature reserve that inspired the Old Forest in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; books.

=== Court offices ===
In 1758 the Earl of Aylesford and five others founded (or possibly re-founded) the Woodmen of Arden. This is an exclusive archery club that takes its offices from the medieval Royal Forest court positions, such as Verderer and Warden. 

The organisation claims to be a successor to an older organisation of woodmen, however there is scant evidence that forest law ever applied in the Forest of Arden.

== Forest law ==

Unlike other forests of the era it does not appear that the Forest of Arden was ever subject to forest law. It is unclear why this is, however it is possibly because wide-scale settlement of the area did not occur until comparatively late, and thus the forest still represented something of a frontier. 

This may have been due to the density and size of the forest – which overlies a large area of clay resulting in natural vegetation of dense broad-leaved woodland like oak and lime – as well as the dangers within such as bears and wolves, which did not become extinct in Great Britain until the sixth and seventeenth centuries respectively. No Roman road penetrated the forest; Icknield Street, Watling Street, and Fosse Way all went around it instead, and a salt track bounded the south side. 

The Domesday book indicates that the area was still little settled by 1086, with a handful of former Iron Age hill forts, Roman forts, and Anglo-Saxon settlements at places like Henley-in-Arden, Coleshill and Ulverlei. A medieval era wayside cross known as the Coughton Cross sits at the southern boundary of the forest, and was allegedly a site where travelers would pray for safe passage through the forest prior to entering. The first major wave of settlement of assarts occurred from the eleventh century to the fourteenth century, as a result of &quot;peasant land hunger&quot; from settlements south of Arden and &quot;seignorial encouragement&quot; and lords desiring to expand their holdings and political power. Even so, settlers had to be enticed to colonise the area. In the planted borough of Solihull the Lord of the Manor offered free burgage tenure in which residents were free, rent-paying burgesses, rather than villeins owing service to the Lord of the Manor. In Tanworth in Arden the Earl of Warwick pursued a policy as overlord that unusually saw over 60 per cent of the income from this manor derived from free rents. 

Royal forests subject to forest law were established on wooded land adjoining the Forest of Arden, at Sutton Park in the Anglo-Saxon era, and Feckenham Forest in the early Norman era, both much smaller and more manageable than the vast untamed land of Arden.

Despite the lack of evidence that the Forest of Arden was ever under forest law, the Woodmen of Arden, founded (or refounded) in 1758, claim to be a revival of a body who traditionally exercised the role of crown forestry officials in the area.

==Geography==
The area is punctuated by a large number of settlements – such as Bearley, Shirley and Henley – ending with &#x27;ley&#x27;, meaning &#x27;a clearing&#x27;. There are also a large number of areas with references to woodland, such as Kingswood, Nuthurst, Packwood, Hollywood, Earlswood, Four Oaks, and so on.
It is not known exactly when deforestation began, but even in the 16th century it was understood that the forest of Arden had been diminished from what it had been due to enclosure and later logging, due amongst other things to the demands of the navy for wood.

The forest itself is today mostly reduced to individual oaks, hedgerows and occasional pockets of ancient woodland, such as the former Royal Forest of Sutton Park and Rough Wood. Ecologist Steven Falk, undertaking research with Warwickshire County Council, conducted a survey of the oldest trees in the Arden area and found over 500 examples of ancient &quot;Quercus robur&quot; (common oak), including examples exceeding 1000 years old. The oldest trees are believed to be in Ryton Woods where &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; (small-leaved lime) has been coppiced for so long that individual coppice stools have become difficult to distinguish from clustered ones. Falk estimates these trees are well over 1000 years old.

The fauna is typical for the wider area, however before emparkment would have included traditional game species such as wild deer, boar and White Park cattle. Many species of deer still roam the region, however the cattle have long since been lost to emparkment. Wild boar were extinct in Great Britain in the 17th century, however they were accidentally reintroduced in the 1970s and sightings have been made in the Arden area.

A number of rivers run through the Arden area including the River Cole and the River Blythe.Given the history and natural geography of the area, tourism supports some of the local economy. Towns in the area include Hampton-in-Arden, Henley-in-Arden, and Tanworth-in-Arden. The name &#x27;Arden&#x27; is used prominently across the region, such as Arden Academy and the Forest of Arden Hotel and Country Club.

The Arden Way is a waymarked UK National Trail that traces old paths and routes through rural areas of the ancient Forest of Arden.

==Government protections==
The Stratford-on-Avon District allocated the Arden area within its borders as a Special Landscape Area in 1996.

Although the Arden area itself is not recognized as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, it borders the Cannock Chase AONB to the north, and Cotswolds AONB to the south.

==Arden Sandstone==

Arden Sandstone is a distinctive Triassic white heterolithic sandstone quarried from the Arden area and used in local buildings. The sandstone contains a large amount of calcium carbonate (&#x27;lime&#x27;) originating from the shells of creatures that lived in the water in which the sandstone formed, which over time develops a reddish hue due to a type of algae (Trentepohlia jolithus) that grows only on such lime-bearing stone.
The stone varies in colour from a muddy brown-red to a brighter orange or red ochre depending on factors such as how long it has been exposed. It is a common building material across the Arden area, and many prominent and famous buildings use it, such as Kenilworth Castle, Maxstoke Castle, St Alphege Church, Solihull, Stoneleigh Abbey Gatehouse, and numerous others.

The stone features prominently in villages across Arden, such as Temple Balsall and Knowle.

==Forest restoration and rewilding==
Deforestation and emparkment has reduced the woodland cover, but it should be kept in mind that &quot;forest&quot; meant a legal and governance territory before it described the tree cover as it does to modern ears.

The area remains largely rural, and pockets of trees, a few ancient woodlands, field boundaries and ancient oaks remain as the heritage of the once much larger forest.

Most of the trees and woodland that made up the forest and still remain are today protected, and there are a number of listed buildings across the area, noted for their history. Many of the buildings are operated by the National Trust and can be visited by tourists.

===Heart of England Forest===
Publisher Felix Dennis planted substantial areas of woodland in the area. He created a charity, the Heart of England Forest, to carry on this work. On his death in 2014 he left most of his fortune to be used for this purpose. 3,000 acres (12.1 km2) have been planted in Spernall, Dorsington and Honeybourne, and at the Lenches in Worcestershire.

===Arden Forest scheme===
In 2021 it was announced that a new &#x27;Arden Forest&#x27; scheme was being established in the borough of Solihull, to create a continuous wildlife corridor across the region, in an effort to restore and rewild some of the forest. The aim is part of a wider project seeking to plant a quarter of a million trees within ten years across the area.

===National forest proposal===
The Countryside Commission considered creating a new national forest in the area in 1989, but the proposal was not taken up. A Community Forest was established in the 1990s to the north of the forest of Arden called the Forest of Mercia, and a national forest has since been established between Leicester and Swadlincote in the East Midlands, however.

<text>Château d&#x27;Hougoumont (possibly originally Goumont or Gomont) is a walled manorial compound, situated at the bottom of an escarpment near the Nivelles road in the Braine-l&#x27;Alleud municipality, near Waterloo, Belgium. The site served as one of the advanced defensible positions of the Anglo-allied army under the Duke of Wellington, that faced Napoleon&#x27;s Army at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815.

Hougoumont, which had become dilapidated, was fully restored in time for the 200th anniversary of the battle and opened to the public on 18 June 2015.

==Description==
Hougoumont has been described as being a lot bigger than La Haye Sainte, a nearby farmhouse. This farmhouse consists of, encompassed by a high-standing wall, the main house, numerous barns, stables, a chapel, and several other features and buildings, including an orchard and garden. The buildings are connected through a system of stone walls with wooden gates. &quot;Waterloo Tourisme&quot; described it as “the best preserved in terms of how it looked after the Battle [of Waterloo].”

==Etymology==
The first mention of Hougoumont is found on the 1777 map of the Austrian Netherlands created by Comte Joseph de Ferraris, marked as &quot;Château Hougoumont&quot;. This is believed to be a
corruption of &quot;Château Goumont&quot;, a name first recorded in an act of the allodial court of Brabant in 1358. Also, in 1356, there is mention of the &quot;tenure and house of Gomont&quot; in the seigneury of Braine-l&#x27;Alleud.

According to Sir Walter Scott who visited the battlefield in January 1816, &quot;Hougoumont (a name bestowed, I believe, by a mistake of our great commander [Wellington], but which will certainly supersede the more proper one of Château-Goumont) is the only place of consideration which was totally destroyed&quot;.

==History==
In 1474 the Order of Saint John (later to become the Order of Malta) bought of forest, Le Goumont, and another of adjacent heathland for 100 golden crowns. The deed of sale did not mention any building on the grounds.

A building had apparently been erected on the land as it was sold in 1536 to Pierre du Fief, attorney-general to the Council of Brabant, who subsequently enlarged the property considerably. In 1562 the estate became the property of Pierre Quarré and stayed in the Quarré family until 1637 when it was bought by Arnold Schuyl, Lord of Walhorn. It was around this time that the present building was erected.

After 1671 the domain became the property of Jan Arrazola de Oñate, chamberlain of Archdukes Albert and Isabella. It remained in the hands of these Lords of Gomont and Tiberchamps until 1791 when Jan-André Arrazola de Oñate died childless at the age of 73. His wife remarried with Phillipe Gouret de Louville, a major in the service of Austria.

Ridder de Louville did not live in the château in 1815 but left the management to Antoine Dumonceau who laid out a splendid French formal garden. After the battle, the then 86 years old Ridder de Louville did not have the funds for much-needed repairs and sold the chateau to François de Robiano.

Through successive marriages and inheritances within the de Robiano family the estate eventually became the property of the d&#x27;Oultremont family in 1917. In 2003 it was sold by Count Guibert d&#x27;Oultremont to the Belgian Region of Wallonia through an intercommunal cooperative society, Bataille de Waterloo 1815.

==The Defence of Hougoumont==
In June 1815 the château became an epicenter of fighting in the Battle of Waterloo as it was one of the first places where British and other allied forces faced Napoleon&#x27;s Army.

===June 1815===


Napoleon planned to draw Wellington&#x27;s reserve to Wellington&#x27;s right flank in defence of Hougoumont and then attack through the centre left of the British and allies&#x27; front near La Haye Sainte.

Before the battle started, Hougoumont and its gardens, located on the allies&#x27; right flank, were garrisoned and fortified by the 1st Battalion, 2nd Nassau Regiment, with additional detachments of &quot;jägers&quot; and landwehr from von Kielmansegge&#x27;s 1st (Hanoverian) Brigade. The light company of the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards under the command of Lt-Colonel Henry Wyndham, was also stationed in the farm and château, and the light company of the 2nd Battalion, Third Guards, under Lt-Colonel Charles Dashwood in the garden and grounds. The two light companies of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, First Guards were initially positioned in the orchard, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Saltoun. Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonell, Coldstream Guards, had overall command of Hougoumont. (The Guards units were all drawn from General John Byng&#x27;s 2nd (British) Brigade.)

Wellington recorded in his despatches &quot;at about ten o&#x27;clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont&quot;. Other sources state that this attack was at about 11:30. The historian Andrew Roberts notes that &quot;It is a curious fact about the battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began&quot;.

The initial attack by Maréchal de Camp Pierre François Bauduin&#x27;s 1st Brigade of the 6th Division emptied the wood and park, but was driven back by heavy British artillery fire and cost Bauduin his life. The British guns were distracted into an artillery duel with French guns and this allowed a second attack by Maréchal de Camp Baron Soye&#x27;s 2nd Brigade of the 6th Division. They managed a small breach on the south side but could not exploit it. An attack on the north side by elements of the 1st Brigade of the 6th Division was more successful.

This attack led to one of the most famous skirmishes in the Battle of Waterloo — Sous-Lieutenant Legros, wielding an axe, managed to break through the north gate. A desperate fight ensued between the invading French soldiers and the defending Guards. In a near-miraculous attack, Macdonell, a small party of officers and Sergeant James Graham fought through the melee to shut the gate, trapping Legros and about 30 other soldiers of the &quot;1st Légère&quot; inside. All of the French who entered were killed except a drummer boy in the desperate hand-to-hand fight.

The British and German Garrison were running low on ammunition and a Driver of the Royal Waggon Train distinguished himself by driving an ammunition cart through the French lines to resupply the troops despite his horses receiving wounds. The French attack in the immediate vicinity of the farm was repulsed by the arrival of the 2nd battalion Coldstream Guards and 2/3rd Foot Guards. Fighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon with its surroundings heavily invested with French light infantry and coordinated cavalry attacks sent against the troops behind Hougoumont.

Wellington&#x27;s army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon Napoleon personally ordered the shelling of the house to cause it to burn, Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house&#x27;s commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat&#x27;s brigade of the King&#x27;s German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without any senior officers, who were then relieved by the 71st Foot, a Scottish light infantry regiment. Adam&#x27;s brigade, further reinforced by Hugh Halkett&#x27;s 3rd (Hanoverian) Brigade, successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille and maintained the occupation of Hougoumont until the end of the battle.

===The battle&#x27;s significance===

The Hougoumont battle has often been characterised as a diversionary attack to cause Wellington to move reserves to his threatened right flank to protect his communications, but this then escalated into an all-day battle which drew in more and more French troops but just a handful of Wellington&#x27;s, having the exact opposite effect to that intended. In fact there is a good case that both Napoleon and Wellington thought Hougoumont was a vital part of the battle. Certainly, Wellington declared afterwards that &quot;the success of the battle turned upon the closing of the gates at Hougoumont&quot;.

Hougoumont was a part of the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33 battalions in all, 14,000 troops). The French forces sent in to attack Hougoumont included:
*nearly the entire II Corps under the command of General Honoré Reille, consisting of detachments of the 6th Division under the command of Jérôme, (Napoleon&#x27;s youngest brother), the divisions of Comte Maximilien Foy (9th), Guilleminot and Joseph Bachelu (5th)
*Kellermann&#x27;s cavalry corps

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21 battalions (12,000 troops) over the course of the afternoon to keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to be admitted to the house. He also moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont.

==Bodies in wells==

In his novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Victor Hugo describes how 300 bodies were thrown down a well at Hougoumont. Several historians have noted that an archaeological dig of the well by Derick Saunders in 1985 turned up no human remains in a well rediscovered at the site. In doing so, they state that it debunks a myth made popular by Hugo.

A popular account of the battle by John Booth published in London shortly after the battle includes a diary entry by an early gentleman tourist to the site. The tourist records that he was shown around that battlefield by the well known guide, Jean-Baptiste Decoster, and that 16 July 1815 (one month after the battle) he saw two wells, one that contained eight men and another that contained 73 men. The first well was at La Belle Alliance &quot;wherein we saw the bodies of eight men of the Imperial Guard of Napoleon; they had jumped down with their arms&quot;; and the second probably at Hougoumont, &quot;The French formed a battery by making holes in the garden-wall; here is another well, in which were found 73 men; the trees in the orchard were peppered very much; the ditch around this orchard was used as a battery, and hundreds killed; saw 84 other pieces of cannon taken from the enemy; they took home only 12 guns; counted 40 graves, containing English officers, in one acre of ground, resembling dung-heaps&quot;.

==Decay and restoration==

Hougoumont remained an active farm until the end of the 20th century. In 2003 a settlement was reached between Count Guibert d&#x27;Oultremont, owner of the farm, and the Regional Authority after which it became the property of the &quot;Intercommunale&quot; (1815). By June 2006, the farm appeared to be derelict. The walls, which were once near pristine white, had become a dirty yellow. Several walls were cracked and parts were clearly damaged, most notably the right-hand door post of the north side gate.

Project Hougoumont, supported by, amongst others, the then-current Duke of Wellington, writer Bernard Cornwell and the late historian Richard Holmes, was set up to oversee funding to restore and preserve Hougoumont for the long-term future. The project was completed in June 2015 at a cost of £3m, with organisations including the Landmark Trust contributing to the funds in return for being allowed to rent part of the property (the Game Keeper&#x27;s Cottage). Charles, Prince of Wales, unveiled a memorial at Hougoumont on 17 June 2015 dedicated to the British soldiers who fought in the battle. The memorial by Vivien Mallock stands next to the north gate and shows two life-size soldiers struggling to close the critical gates of the farm to save it from being overrun by the French. The next day (18 June 2015) Hougoumont was opened to the public on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.

<text>Falkenstein Castle or &quot;Castrum Pfronten&quot; is the ruin of a castle in the Bavarian Alps, near Pfronten, Germany. At above sea level, it is Germany&#x27;s highest castle. King Ludwig II of Bavaria purchased the ruin in 1883 and planned to construct a fairy tale castle, but the plans were abandoned upon his death in 1886.

==Geography==
The ruins of Falkenstein Castle are located on the eponymous Falkenstein above sea level, making it Germany&#x27;s highest elevated castle.

==Castrum Pfronten==
Originally known as Castrum Pfronten, the stone castle was built approximately 1270–1280 by Count Meinhard II of Tyrol on the borders of his land. Because of the unusual situation of the castle it has been interpreted in historical context as a symbol of opposition to the Duchy of Bavaria. (During the winter the castle was dangerous to inhabit because of the high altitude at which it is located.) The name Castle Falkenstein only came into use in the 15th century.

The castle was largely destroyed in the 17th century. In 1646, towards the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Austrian outposts of Falkenstein, Eisenberg, and Hohenfreyberg were set on fire on the orders of the Tyrolean state government to prevent them from being used by the approaching Protestants. The attackers changed their line of advance, so the destruction was unnecessary. All three castles have remained uninhabited ruins since.

==Ludwig&#x27;s vision==
King Ludwig II of Bavaria purchased the ruin in 1883 and commissioned several architects, the first being Christian Jank (the designer of Neuschwanstein), to replace the existing structure with a romantic castle.

Jank first created a restrained design, but later envisioned the castle in a dramatic, High Gothic style. Georg von Dollmann was employed to produce plans and elevations in the same year based on Jank&#x27;s design. However, his modest and economical designs displeased Ludwig.

The task of redesigning Falkenstein was then given to Max Schultze, the Prince Thurn und Taxis&#x27; architect, who was flattered by the royal commission. He not only planned the architecture of the castle in a robber baron&#x27;s style (a highly simplified version of Jank&#x27;s sketch), but also began creating the castle&#x27;s interior design and frescos (in a secular Byzantine style) with the help of August Spieß. Of particular note was Ludwig&#x27;s bedroom, which was reminiscent of a vast chapel. During this time, in 1884, road and water lines were made to service the site and a papier-mâché model of Schultze&#x27;s plan was created. However, Schultze withdrew from the project in 1885.

Julius Hofmann and Eugen Drollinger were chosen to succeed Schultze, although they knew that it was unlikely Falkenstein would ever be built. Thus, they made their designs as spectacular and impractical as they wished. Drollinger was working on a plan of Ludwig&#x27;s bedchamber – redesigned to feature stained glass windows and a mosaic dome – when he learned of the King&#x27;s death.

Ludwig died in 1886 before work on the castle proper could begin, and the many plans for Falkenstein were permanently abandoned. The ruin of Castrum Pfronten on the building site was never demolished.

<text>Paul Diel (11 July 1893 – 5 January 1972) was a French psychologist of Austrian origin who developed the method of introspective analysis and the psychology of motivation.

==Life==

Diel was born in Vienna, Austria, on 11 July 1893, to a teacher of German origin and an unknown man. He was orphaned at the age of 13 after spending 8 years in a religious orphanage, but was able to obtain his baccalauréat with the support of a benefactor. Diel did not pursue formal higher education, but instead became an actor, novelist, and poet before teaching himself philosophy. Inspired by the philosophers Plato, Kant and Spinoza, and also by the psychologists Freud, Adler and Jung, he delved into his own psychological research and established the basis of the introspective analysis method that helped him develop his theories of the psychology of motivation.

Diel practiced psychotherapy at the central hospital of Vienna, and in 1935 he sent his work on introspective analysis to Albert Einstein. Einstein greatly appreciated Diel&#x27;s work and they established a correspondence that did not end until Einstein&#x27;s death in 1955.

In 1938, after the Nazi German &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria, Diel escaped to France and worked at the Sainte-Anne psychiatric hospital in Paris. Unfortunately, because he was a foreign national, he became imprisoned in the Gurs internment camp in southern France during World War II. After his release, he was able to join CNRS in 1945 with the backing of Einstein and Irène Joliot-Curie. At CNRS he worked as a children&#x27;s psychotherapist in Henri Wallon&#x27;s laboratory.

Diel continued working as a researcher and psychotherapist and had trained a group of students and published books on various subjects like education, symbolism and evolution when he died of cancer in Paris on 5 January 1972.

<doc id="640363" wikidata="Q342889" url="?curid=640363" title="Adam Jerzy Czartoryski">
<text>Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (14 January 1770 – 15 July 1861), also known as Adam George Czartoryski, was a Polish nobleman, statesman, diplomat and author who served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire. 

The son of a wealthy prince, he began his political career as a foreign minister to Emperor Alexander I of Russia after Poland was partitioned by Russia, Prussia and Austria. He later became a leader of the Polish government in exile during and after the failed November Uprising (1830–1831) and a bitter opponent of Alexander&#x27;s successor, Nicholas I. In exile, he advocated for the reestablishment of a sovereign Polish state, which also stimulated early Balkan and Belgian nationalism, and intensified their desire for independence.

Czartoryski was a dedicated patron of arts and greatly contributed to the Czartoryski Collection. In 1798, he purchased one of Poland&#x27;s most important national treasures – Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot;, which he brought as a gift for his mother from Italy.

== Early life and education ==

Czartoryski was born on 14 January 1770 in Warsaw. He was the son of Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski and Izabela Flemming. It was rumoured that Adam was the fruit of a liaison between Izabela and Russian ambassador to Poland, Nikolai Repnin. However, Repnin left the country two years before Adam Czartoryski was born. After careful education at home by eminent specialists, mostly French, he went abroad in 1786. At Gotha, Czartoryski heard Johann Wolfgang von Goethe read his &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; and made the acquaintance of the dignified Johann Gottfried Herder and the &quot;fat little Christoph Martin Wieland&quot;.

In 1789, Czartoryski visited Great Britain with his mother and was present at the trial of Warren Hastings. On a second visit in 1793, he made many acquaintances among the British aristocracy and studied the British constitution.

In the interval between these visits, he fought for Poland during the Polish–Russian War of 1792, which preceded the Second Partition of Poland. He was one of the early recipients of the &quot;Virtuti Militari&quot; decoration for valour there. He was arrested on his way to Poland at Brussels by the Austrian government. After the Third Partition of Poland, the Czartoryski estates were confiscated, and in May 1795, Adam and his younger brother Konstanty were summoned to Saint Petersburg.

== Career in Russia ==
=== Friendship with Tsarevich Alexander ===
Later in 1795, the two brothers were commanded to enter Russian military service. Adam became an officer in the horse and Konstanty one in the foot guards. Catherine the Great was so favourably impressed by the youths that she restored them part of their estates and in early 1796 made them gentlemen-in-waiting.

Adam had already met Grand Duke Alexander at a ball at Princess Golitsyna&#x27;s, and the two young men at once evinced a strong &quot;intellectual friendship&quot; for each other. Czartoryski was already connected with the imperial family. His elder sister Maria was married to the then-Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s brother, Duke Louis of Württemberg. On the accession of Tsar Paul I, Czartoryski was appointed adjutant to Alexander, who was now &quot;Tsarevich&quot;, and was permitted to revisit his Polish estates for three months.

At this time, the tone of the Russian court was relatively liberal. Political reformers, including Pyotr Volkonsky and Nikolay Novosiltsev, possessed great influence on the tsar. Czartoryski was not only close with Alexander, but Alexander&#x27;s wife, the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Alexeievna as well. Born Princess Louise of Baden, she was married to the Grand Duke Alexander at the age of fourteen, and though she and Alexander shared a friendly bond, Alexander sought romantic comfort elsewhere. Elizabeth Alexeievna soon fell in love with Czartoryski, who reciprocated her feelings. After Elizabeth gave birth to a baby girl on 29 May 1799, the Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, the Tsar Paul I didn&#x27;t hide his suspicions, with both Elizabeth and Alexander having fair hair, and the baby having dark hair. Czartoryski was then sent on a diplomatic mission to the court of Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. The baby died soon after. On reaching Italy, Czartoryski found that that monarch was a king without a kingdom and so the outcome of his first diplomatic mission was a pleasant tour through Italy to Naples, the acquisition of the Italian language and a careful exploration of the antiquities of Rome.

In the spring of 1801, the new tsar, Alexander I, summoned his friend back to Saint Petersburg. Czartoryski found the tsar still suffering from remorse at his father&#x27;s assassination and could do nothing but talk about religion and politics to a small circle of friends. Against all remonstrances, he replied only, &quot;There&#x27;s plenty of time&quot;.

=== Curator of Vilna University ===
Tsar Alexander appointed Czartoryski administrator of the educational district of Vilna (Polish: Wilno, Lithuanian: Vilnius) and curator of the Vilna Academy (3 April 1803) so that he might give full play to his advanced ideas. He greatly improved the Polish education system.

He was to keep those function until 1824.

=== Foreign minister ===
Czartoryski paid most attention to foreign affairs; as the tsar&#x27;s key advisor, he exercised practical control of Russian diplomacy. His first act had been to protest energetically against Napoleon&#x27;s murder of a Bourbon royal prince, the Duke of Enghien (20 March 1804), and to insist on an immediate rupture with the government of the French Revolution, which was under Napoléon Bonaparte, whom the tsar considered a regicide.

On 7 June 1804, the French minister, Gabriel Marie Joseph, comte d&#x27;Hédouville, left St. Petersburg, and on 11 August a note, dictated by Czartoryski to Alexander, was sent to the Russian minister in London to urge the formation of an anti-French coalition. It was also Czartoryski who framed the Convention of 6 November 1804 whereby Russia agreed to put 115,000 and Austria 235,000, men in the field against Napoleon.

Finally, in April 1805, he signed an offensive-defensive alliance with George III&#x27;s United Kingdom.

Czartoryski&#x27;s most striking ministerial act, however, was a memorial written in 1805, otherwise undated, which aimed at transforming the whole map of Europe. Austria and Prussia were to divide Germany between them. Russia was to acquire the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora, the Bosporus with Constantinople and Corfu. Austria was to have Bosnia , Wallachia and Ragusa. Montenegro, enlarged by Mostar and the Ionian Islands, was to form a separate state. The United Kingdom and Russia together were to maintain the equilibrium of the world. In return for their acquisitions in Germany, Austria and Prussia were to consent to the creation of an autonomous Polish state extending from Danzig (Gdańsk) to the sources of the Vistula under the protection of Russia. That plan presented the best guarantee at the time for the independent existence of Poland. However, in the meantime, Austria had come to an understanding with Britain about subsidies, and war had begun.

=== Chief minister ===

In 1805 Czartoryski accompanied Alexander to Berlin and to Olmütz, Austria (now Olomouc, Moravia), as chief minister. He regarded the Berlin visit as a blunder, chiefly due to his distrust of Prussia, but Alexander ignored his representations, and in February 1807 Czartoryski lost favour and was superseded by Andrei Budberg.

Though no longer a minister, Czartoryski continued still to enjoy Alexander&#x27;s confidence in private, and in 1810, the Tsar candidly admitted to Czartoryski that in 1805 he had been in error and that had not made proper use of Czartoryski&#x27;s opportunities.

The same year, Czartoryski left Saint Petersburg forever, but the personal relations between him and Alexander were never better. They met again as friends at Kalisz (Greater Poland) shortly before the signing of the Russo-Prussian alliance on 20 February 1813, and Czartoryski was in the tsar&#x27;s suite at Paris in 1814 and rendered him material services at the Congress of Vienna. At the Congress of Vienna, Alexander had also been asked to agree to a divorce for the Empress Elizabeth so that she could marry Czartoryski. This request was refused.

== Career in Congress Poland (1815–1831) ==
=== Constitutional period (1815–1830) ===
It was considered that Czartoryski, who more than any other man had prepared the way for the creation of Congress Poland and had designed the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland, would be its first &quot;namiestnik&quot;, or viceroy, but the tsar chose a general who had fought in the Grande Armée, Józef Zajączek. Czartoryski was content with the title of senator-palatine and a role in the administration.

In 1817, he married Princess Anna Zofia Sapieha. The wedding led to a duel with his rival, Ludwik Pac.

On his father&#x27;s death in 1823, Czartoryski retired to his ancestral castle at Puławy.

In 1824 he lost the charge of curator of the Wilno University, in relation with the Philomaths trial. He was replaced by Nikolay Novosiltsev.

=== Insurrectional period (1830–1831) ===
However, the 29 November 1830 uprising brought him back to public life.

He became president of the provisional government established on 3 December and summoned (18 December 1830) the &quot;Sejm&quot; of 1831, which chose General Chlopicki as dictator. After Chlopicki&#x27;s resignation (18 January) and the dethroning by the Sejm of Nicolas I as king of Poland (25 January), Czartoryski was elected chief of the Polish National Government by 121 out of 138 votes (30 January 1831).
In August 1831, the military situation was bad. General Ivan Paskevich was approaching Warsaw from the West and the commander-in-chief, General Skrzynecki was dismissed (9 August). On 15 and 16 August, there were riots in Warsaw, and many imprisoned supposed traitors, notably two generals, were hanged. Czartoryski decided to resign from the government after he had sacrificed half of his fortune to the national cause. He was replaced by General Krukowiecki as both head of the government and commander in chief.

Yet the sexagenarian statesman continued to display great energy. On 23 August 1831, he joined Italian General Girolamo Ramorino&#x27;s army corps as a volunteer and subsequently formed a confederation of the three southern provinces of Kalisz, Sandomierz and Kraków. At the war&#x27;s end, when the uprising was crushed by the Russians (Warsaw was taken on 8 September), he fled under false identity to the Cracow Republic, then in Austria, and from there could reach England.

== Exile ==
=== London (1831–1832) ===
Afterwards, he was sentenced to death, though the sentence was soon commuted to exile.

On 25 February 1832, while in the United Kingdom, he kept advancing the Polish cause and with the help of influential friends, many of them Scottish, inspired the creation of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland, based in London, but with branches in Glasgow, Birmingham and Hull.

=== Paris (from 1832) ===
That same year, Czartoryski left England for France, taking up residence in Paris. As a magnate and arguably the most considerable Polish-émigré figure of the time – Czartoryski was Chairman of the Polish National Uprising Government, and leader of a political emigre party (thousands of Poles had emigrated to France in the Great Emigration).

Czartoryski was an active leader of the mushrooming committees that were formed to maintain political momentum and salvage Polish cultural heritage in the exile community. He was the founding chairman, in April 1832, of a Historical and Literary Society. In 1838 he became the legal owner and founding president (for life) of the Polish Library in Paris, the first repository of polonica, books, and archives outside the territory of Poland, which had secured, with French public support, a building on the Ile Saint-Louis in the heart of Paris.

In 1843 he bought the Hôtel Lambert on the Île Saint-Louis and his political faction came to be identified by his private address, simply as the &quot;Hôtel Lambert&quot;.

===Turkish projects===
His tireless efforts on behalf of Poland continued well into his seventies: in 1842 he conceived a project to found a Polish settlement in rural Turkey. Czartoryski wanted to create a second emigration centre there, after the first one in Paris. He sent his representative, Michał Czajkowski, to Turkey and purchased a forest area which encompasses present-day Adampol from the missionary order of Lazarists. The settlement was named Adam-koj (Adamköy) after its founder, in Turkish, the &quot;Village of Adam&quot;, whereas in Polish it was referred to as &quot;Adampol&quot;. Polonezköy or Adampol survives to this day as a small village on the Asian side of Istanbul, about 30 kilometres from the historic city centre. At its inception, the village was inhabited by just 12 people, while at its peak, there were no more than 220 people. Over time, Adampol developed and became populated by emigrants from the unsuccessful 1848 Revolution, the Crimean War in 1853, and by escapees from Siberia and from captivity in Circassia. The Polish villagers engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry.

===Diplomatic efforts for a new Polish Commonwealth===
After the November Uprising in 1830-31 until his death, Czartoryski supported the idea of resurrecting an updated Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on federal principles.

The visionary statesman and former friend, confidant and &quot;de facto&quot; foreign minister of Russia&#x27;s Tsar Alexander I acted as the &quot;uncrowned king and unacknowledged foreign minister&quot; of a non-existent Poland.

Czartoryski was disappointed when the hopes that had he held as late as the Congress of Vienna of Alexander undertaking reforms failed to materialise. His subsequent thoughts were distilled in a book, completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, &quot;Essai sur la diplomatie&quot; (Essay on Diplomacy). According to the historian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski, it is indispensable to an understanding of the Prince&#x27;s many activities conducted in Paris following the ill-fated Polish November 1830 Uprising. Czartoryski wanted to find a place for Poland in the Europe of the time. He sought to interest Western Europeans in the adversities facing his stateless nation, which he still considered to be an indispensable part of the European political structure.

Adhering to the Polish motto, &quot;for our freedom and yours&quot;, Czartoryski connected Polish efforts for independence with similar movements in other subjugated nations of Europe and in the East as far as the Caucasus. Thanks to his private initiative and generosity, the émigrés of his subjugated nation conducted a foreign policy often on a broader scale than had the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Of particular interest are Czartoryski&#x27;s observations, in his &quot;Essay on Diplomacy&quot;, regarding Russia&#x27;s role in the world. He wrote that, &quot;Having extended her sway south and west, and being by the nature of things unreachable from the east and north, Russia becomes a source of constant threat to Europe.&quot; He argued that it would have been in Russia&#x27;s greater interest to have surrounded herself with &quot;friend[s rather than] slave[s].&quot; Czartoryski also identified a future threat from Prussia and urged the incorporation of East Prussia into a resurrected Poland.

Above all, he aspired to reconstitute – with French, British and Turkish support – a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth federated with the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians and all the South Slavs of the future Yugoslavia.
Poland, according to his vision, could have mediated the conflicts between Hungary and the Slavs, and between Hungary and Romania. At the same time, the Belgian people were also seeking independence.

Czartoryski&#x27;s plan seemed achievable during the period of national revolutions in 1848–49, but foundered through the lack of western support, on Hungarian intransigence toward the Czechs, Slovaks and Romanians, and on the rise of German nationalism.&quot; &quot;Nevertheless&quot;, Dziewanowski, concludes &quot;the Prince&#x27;s endeavour constitutes a [vital] link [between] the 16th century Jagiellonian [federative prototype] and Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s federative-Prometheist programme [that was to follow after World War I].&quot;

Czartoryski died at his country residence east of Paris, at Montfermeil, near Meaux, on 15 July 1861. He left two sons, Witold (1824–65), Władysław (1828–94), and a daughter Izabela, who in 1857 married Jan Kanty Działyński.

<doc id="640366" wikidata="Q2265428" url="?curid=640366" title="List of lakes of the Lake District">
<text>This list contains the lakes, tarns and reservoirs in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England.

Only one body of water, Bassenthwaite Lake, is traditionally named a &quot;lake&quot;. Larger bodies of water in the Lake District are generally named as &quot;mere&quot; or &quot;water&quot;, whilst smaller ones are denoted by &quot;tarn&quot;. Some writers, particularly in the media, refer to &quot;Lake Windermere&quot; though this use is deprecated.

==Physical characteristics of the main lakes==

This table gives details of those bodies of water with a surface area of at least 0.1 km².

==Map of major lakes==
The map shows the locations of the lakes with a volume over 4 x 106 m³ and gives an indication of the volume of water in each lake. The markers suggest this by showing the size of a drop of water where the volume of the drop would be in proportion to the quantity of water in the lake (the diameter of the drop is proportional to the cube root of the lake&#x27;s volume).

<text>Super Size Me is a 2004 American documentary film directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock, an American independent filmmaker. Spurlock&#x27;s film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2, 2003, during which he claimed to consume only McDonald&#x27;s food, although he later disclosed he was also drinking heavy amounts of alcohol. The film documents the drastic change on Spurlock&#x27;s physical and psychological health and well-being. It also explores the fast food industry&#x27;s corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit and gain. 

The film prompted widespread debate about public eating habits and has since come under scrutiny for the accuracy of its science and the truthfulness of Spurlock&#x27;s on-camera claims.

Spurlock ate at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants three times a day, consuming every item on the chain&#x27;s menu at least once. Spurlock claimed to have consumed an average of 20.9 megajoules or 5,000 kcal (the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs) per day during the experiment. He also walked about 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) a day. An intake of around 2,500 kcal within a healthy balanced diet is more generally recommended for a man to maintain his weight. At the end of the experiment the then-32-year-old Spurlock had gained , a 13% body mass increase, increased his cholesterol to 230 mg/dL (6.0 mmol/L), and experienced mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and fat accumulation in his liver.

The reason for Spurlock&#x27;s investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout US society, which the Surgeon General has declared an &quot;epidemic&quot;, and the corresponding lawsuit brought against McDonald&#x27;s on behalf of two overweight girls, who, it was alleged, became obese as a result of eating McDonald&#x27;s food (&quot;Pelman v. McDonald&#x27;s Corp., 237 F. Supp. 2d 512&quot;). Spurlock argued that, although the lawsuit against McDonald&#x27;s failed (and subsequently many state legislatures have legislated against product liability actions against producers and distributors of &quot;fast food&quot;), as well as the McLibel case, much of the same criticism leveled against the tobacco companies applies to fast food franchises whose product is both physiologically addictive and physically harmful.

The documentary was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and won Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. A comic book related to the movie has been made with Dark Horse Comics as the publisher containing stories based on numerous cases of fast food health scares. 

Spurlock released a sequel, &quot;Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!&quot;, in 2017.

==Synopsis==
As the film begins, Spurlock is in above-average physical shape, according to his personal trainer. He is seen by three physicians (cardiologist Stephen Siegel, gastroenterologist/hepatologist Lisa Ganjhu, and general practitioner Daryl Isaacs), as well as a nutritionist and a personal trainer. All of the health professionals predict the &quot;McDiet&quot; will have unwelcome effects on his body, but none expect anything too drastic, as his cardiologist Dr. Stephen Siegel cites the human body as being &quot;extremely adaptable&quot;. Prior to the experiment, Spurlock ate a varied diet but always had vegan evening meals to accommodate his girlfriend, Alexandra, a vegan chef. At the beginning of the experiment, Spurlock, who stood tall, had a body weight of .

===Experiment===

Spurlock followed specific rules governing his eating habits:
* He must fully eat three McDonald&#x27;s meals daily: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
* He must consume every item on the McDonald&#x27;s menu at least once over the course of the 30 days (he managed this in nine days).
* He must ingest only items offered on the McDonald&#x27;s menu, including bottled water. All outside consumption of food is prohibited.
* He must Super Size the meal if offered (as upselling), but not by his own request. (He Supersized a total of nine times, five times while in Texas and four times while in New York).
* He will attempt to walk about as much as a typical United States citizen, based on a suggested figure of 5,000 standardized distance steps per day, but he did not closely adhere to this, as he walked more while in New York than in Houston.

On February 1, Spurlock started the month with breakfast near his home in Manhattan, where there were an average of four McDonald&#x27;s locations (and 66,950 residents, with twice as many commuters) per square mile (2.6 km²). He aimed to keep the distances he walked in line with the 5,000 steps (approximately ) walked per day by the average American.

The second day brought Spurlock&#x27;s first (of nine) Super Sized meals, which he ate at the McDonald&#x27;s on 34th Street and Tenth Avenue. It consisted of a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Super Size French fries, and a 42-ounce Coca-Cola, which took him 22 minutes to eat. He experienced steadily increasing stomach discomfort during the process, and then finally vomited in the McDonald&#x27;s parking lot.

After five days, Spurlock gained (from 185.5 to about 195 pounds). It was not long before he found himself experiencing depression, and he claimed that his bouts of it, along with lethargy and headaches, could be relieved by eating a McDonald&#x27;s meal. His gastroenterologist, Dr. Lisa Ganjhu, described him as being &quot;addicted&quot;. At his second weigh-in he had gained another , putting his weight at . By the end of the month he weighed about , an increase of about . Because he could eat only McDonald&#x27;s food, Spurlock refused to take any medication at all. At one weigh-in, Spurlock had &quot;lost&quot; 1 lb. from the previous weigh-in, and a nutritionist hypothesized that he had lost muscle mass, which weighs more than an identical volume of fat. At another weigh-in a nutritionist said Spurlock had gained in 12 days.

Spurlock&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Alexandra Jamieson, attested to the fact that Spurlock lost much of his energy and sex drive during his experiment. It was not clear at the time whether or not Spurlock would be able to complete the entire month of the high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, and his family and friends began to express concern.

On Day 21, Spurlock had heart palpitations and liver damage. His internist, Dr. Daryl Isaacs, advised him to stop what he was doing immediately to avoid any serious health problems. He compared Spurlock with the protagonist played by Nicolas Cage in the movie &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, who intentionally drinks himself to death in a matter of weeks. Despite this warning Spurlock decided to continue the experiment.

On March 2nd, Spurlock reached day 30 and achieved his goal. In thirty days he &quot;supersized&quot; his meals nine times (five of which were in Texas, four in New York City). His physicians were surprised at the degree of deterioration in Spurlock&#x27;s health. He noted that he has eaten as many McDonald&#x27;s meals as most nutritionists say the ordinary person should eat in eight years. (He ate 90 meals, which is close to the number of meals consumed once a month in an eight-year period.)

===Findings===

The documentary&#x27;s end text states that it took Spurlock five months to lose and another nine months to lose the last . His then-girlfriend Alex, now his ex-wife, began supervising his recovery with a vegan &quot;detox diet&quot;, which became the basis for her book &quot;The Great American Detox Diet&quot;.

The movie ends with a rhetorical question, &quot;Who do you want to see go first, you or them?&quot; This is accompanied by a cartoon tombstone, which reads &quot;Ronald McDonald (1954–2012)&quot;, which originally appeared in &quot;The Economist&quot; in an article addressing the ethics of marketing to children.

A short epilogue showed that the salads can contain even more calories than burgers if the customer adds liberal amounts of cheese and dressing before consumption. It also described McDonald&#x27;s discontinuation of the Super Size option six weeks after the movie&#x27;s premiere, as well as its recent emphasis on healthier menu items such as salads, and the release of the new adult Happy Meal. McDonald&#x27;s denied that these changes had anything to do with the film.

==Reception==
&quot;Super Size Me&quot; premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, where Morgan Spurlock won the Grand Jury Prize for directing the film. The film opened in the US on May 7, 2004, and grossed a total of $11,536,423 worldwide, making it the 7th highest-grossing documentary film of all time. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, but lost to the film &quot;Born into Brothels.&quot; It did, however, win the award for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America.

The film received overall positive reviews from critics and audiences. It holds a 92% rating on the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 7.73/10. The consensus calls the film an &quot;entertaining doc about the adverse effects of eating fast food.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 37 critics.

&quot;Super Size Me&quot; received two thumbs up on &quot;At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper&quot;. Caroline Westbrook for &quot;BBC News&quot; stated that the hype for the documentary was proper &quot;to a certain extent&quot;, because of its serious message, and that, overall, the film&#x27;s &quot;high comedy factor and over-familiarity of the subject matter render it less powerful than other recent documentaries – but it still makes for enjoyable, thought-provoking viewing.&quot; One reviewer said &quot;he&#x27;s telling us something everyone already knows: Fast food is bad for you.&quot;

Robert Davis of &quot;Paste&quot; said the film accomplished some of its goals and addressed an important topic, but, at the same time, sometimes looked more like a publicity stunt than a documentary. He primarily criticized the dramatic and unscientific approach of &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, saying Spurlock unnecessarily ate more than he had to and ignored his nutritionist&#x27;s advice. Davis explained he would have been more interested had the documentary been about trying to eat as healthy as possible at McDonald&#x27;s: &quot;You could choose low-fat options, but it would be impossible to get enough vegetables and fiber, and the low-fat meal would be incredibly bland, the product of a system that has worked to optimize food delivery and consistency and, in doing so, has invented foods so devoid of flavor that they require dressings, oils, beef tallow and goopy coatings to make them more than just textured blobs. The industry has worked hard to convince consumers that these odd, sweet flavors are not only good but also unique, recognizable parts of a brand. Spurlock doesn&#x27;t attempt to convey this message, presumably because the affects of too few vegetables and too little fiber aren&#x27;t as dramatic as speedy weight-and-cholesterol gains.&quot;

McDonald&#x27;s UK responded that the author intentionally consumed an average of 5,000 calories per day and did not exercise, and that the results would have been the same regardless of the source of overeating.

===Counter-claims===
In his reply documentary &quot;Fat Head&quot;, Tom Naughton &quot;suggests that Spurlock&#x27;s calorie and fat counts don&#x27;t add up&quot; and noted Spurlock&#x27;s refusal to publish the &quot;Super Size Me&quot; food log. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reports: &quot;Unlike Spurlock, Naughton has a page on his Web site that lists every item (including nutritional information) he ate during his fast-food month.&quot;

After eating exclusively at McDonald&#x27;s for one month, Soso Whaley said, &quot;The first time I did the diet in April 2004, I lost 10 pounds (going from 175 to 165) and lowered my cholesterol from 237 to 197, a drop of 40 points.&quot; Of particular note was that she exercised regularly and did not insist on consuming more food than she otherwise would. Despite eating at only McDonald&#x27;s every day, she maintained her caloric intake at around 2,000 per day.

After John Cisna, a high school science teacher, lost 60 pounds while eating exclusively at McDonald&#x27;s for 180 days, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not pushing McDonald&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not pushing fast food. I&#x27;m pushing taking accountability and making the right choice for you individually... As a science teacher, I would never show &quot;Super Size Me&quot; because when I watched that, I never saw the educational value in that... I mean, a guy eats uncontrollable amounts of food, stops exercising, and the whole world is surprised he puts on weight? What I&#x27;m not proud about is probably 70 to 80 percent of my colleagues across the United States still show &quot;Super Size Me&quot; in their health class or their biology class. I don&#x27;t get it.&quot;

As a counterpoint, the film features interviews with Big Mac aficionado Don Gorske, who eats multiple Big Macs each day, yet maintains healthy weight and cholesterol levels, as well as good mental health.

A 2006 study on fast food consumption by healthy individuals inspired by the documentary showed that, while the heavy diet does affect liver enzymes, it did not show the same dangerous effect shown in the documentary. This suggested that the extreme reaction must have had another cause, and in 2017, Spurlock – who previously told his doctors he did not drink – admitted to copious amounts of alcohol consumption during the making of the film, which some critics, such as documentary filmmaker Phelim McAleer, have argued may better account for his liver issues and other health problems, since he had only changed his diet and not his alcohol intake during the experiment.

==Impact==
Six weeks after the film&#x27;s debut, McDonald&#x27;s discontinued its supersize portions, although they claimed the decision had nothing to do with the film itself. In the United Kingdom, McDonald&#x27;s publicized a website which included a response to and criticisms of the film. In theaters in the UK, the company placed a brief ad in the film&#x27;s trailers, pointing to the URL and stating, &quot;See what we disagree with. See what we agree with.&quot;

Internationally, &quot;Super Size Me&quot; was a major success in the box office of Australia. McDonald&#x27;s in Australia responded with an advertising campaign that included three elements: two advertisements for TV and one produced to be shown in movie theaters.

The film was the inspiration for the BBC television series &quot;The Supersizers...&quot; in which the presenters dine on historical meals and take medical tests to ascertain the impact on their health.

The film was also the inspiration for the 2007 documentary film &quot;Super High Me&quot;, directed by Michael Blieden. The film follows Doug Benson, a comedian and cannabis enthusiast, as he becomes the subject to a multitude of tests designed to measure the physical and mental impacts of, first, not smoking cannabis for 30 days, and then smoking non-stop for 30 days. The poster for the movie was modeled after one of the promotional posters from &quot;Super Size Me&quot;.

The premise of the 2011 documentary &quot;Forks Over Knives&quot; was to create the &quot;reverse&quot; of &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, where the film&#x27;s director &quot;goes on this diet and gets better, instead of getting fatter and sicker&quot;.

<text>Samuel Hearne (February 1745 – November 1792) was an English explorer, fur-trader, author and naturalist. 

He was the first European to make an overland excursion across northern Canada to the Arctic Ocean, specifically to Coronation Gulf, via the Coppermine River. In 1774, Hearne built Cumberland House for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, its second interior trading post after Henley House and the first permanent settlement in present Saskatchewan.

==Biography==
Samuel Hearne was born in February 1745 in London. Hearne&#x27;s father was Secretary of the Waterworks of London Bridge, died in 1748. His mother&#x27;s name was Diana, and his sister Sarah was three years younger than him. Samuel Hearne joined the British Royal Navy in 1756 at the age of 11 as midshipman under the fighting captain Samuel Hood. He remained with Hood during the Seven Years&#x27; War, seeing considerable action during the conflict, including the bombardment of Le Havre in 1759. At the end of the war, having served in the English Channel and then the Mediterranean, he left the Navy in 1763.

In February 1766, he joined the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as a mate on the sloop &quot;Churchill&quot;, which was then engaged in the Inuit trade out of Prince of Wales Fort, near present-day Churchill, Manitoba. Two years later, he became mate on the Brigantine &quot;Charlotte&quot; and participated in the company&#x27;s short-lived black whale fishery. In 1767, he found the remains of James Knight&#x27;s expedition. In 1768, he examined portions of the Hudson Bay coasts with a view to improving the cod fishery. During this time, he gained a reputation for snowshoeing.

Hearne was able to improve his navigational skills by observing William Wales who was at Hudson Bay during 1768–1769 after being commissioned by the Royal Society to observe the Transit of Venus with Joseph Dymond.

==Exploration==
The English on Hudson Bay had long known that the First Nations to the northwest used native copper, as indicated by such words as Yellowknife. When, in 1768, a northern First Nation (some say it was Matonabbee) brought lumps of copper to Churchill, the governor, Moses Norton, decided to send Hearne in search of a possible copper mine. The basic theme of Hearne&#x27;s three journeys is the Englishmen&#x27;s ignorance of the methods of travel through this very difficult country and their dependence on First Nations who knew the land and how to live off of it.

&quot;First Journey:&quot; Since there was no canoe route to the northwest, the plan was to go on foot over the frozen winter ground. Without canoes, they would have to carry as much food as possible and then live off the land. Hearne planned to join a group of northern First Nations that had come to trade at Churchill and somehow induce them to lead him to the copper mine. He left Churchill on 6 November 1769 along with two company employees, two Cree hunters and a band of Chipewyans and went north across the Seal River, an east–west river north of Churchill. 

By 19 November their European provisions gave out and their hunters had found little game (Hearne had left too late in the season and the caribou had already left the Barren Grounds for the shelter of the forested country further south). They headed west and north, finding only a few ptarmigan, fish and three stray caribou. The Indigenous people, who knew the country, had better sense than to risk starvation in this way and began deserting. When the last First Nations left, Hearne and his European companions returned to the sheltered valley of the Seal River, where he was able to find venison, and reached Churchill on 11 December.

&quot;Second Journey:&quot; Since he could not control the northern First Nations, Hearne proposed to try again using &#x27;home guards&#x27;, that is, Cree who lived around the post and hunted in exchange for European supplies. He left Churchill on 23 February. Reaching the Seal River, he found good hunting and followed it west until he reached a large lake, probably Sethnanei Lake. Here he decided to wait for better weather and live by fishing. In April, the fish began to give out. On 24 April, a large body of Indigenous people, mostly women, arrived from the south for the annual goose hunt. On 19 May, the geese arrived and there was now plenty to eat. They headed north and east past Baralzone Lake. By June, the geese had flown further north and they were again threatened with famine. At one point, they killed three muskoxen and had to eat them raw because it was too wet to light a fire. 

They crossed the Kazan River above Yathkyed Lake where they found good hunting and fishing and then went west to Lake Dubawnt which is about northwest of Churchill. On 14 August, his quadrant was destroyed, which accounts for the inaccuracy of latitudes on the remainder to this and the next journey. At this point the sources become vague, but Hearne returned to Churchill in the autumn. On his return journey he met Matonabbee who was to be his guide on the next journey. Matonabbee may well have saved him from freezing or starving to death. Most of the land Hearne crossed on his second journey is very desolate and was not properly explored again until Joseph Tyrrell in 1893.

&quot;Third Journey:&quot; Hearne contrived to travel as the only European with a group of Chipewyan guides led by Matonabbee. The group included eight of Matonabbee&#x27;s wives to act as beasts of burden in the sledge traces, camp servant and cooks. This third expedition set out in December 1770, to reach the Coppermine River in summer, by which he could descend to the Arctic in canoes.

Matonabbee kept a fast pace, so fast they reached the great caribou traverse before provisions dwindled and in time for the spring hunt. Here Northern First Nations (Dene) hunters gathered to hunt the vast herds of caribou migrating north for the summer. A store of meat was laid up for Hearne&#x27;s voyage and a band of &quot;Yellowknife&quot; Dene joined the expedition. Matonabbee ordered his women to wait for his return in the Athabasca country to the west.

The Dene were generally a mild and peaceful people, however, they were in a state of conflict with the Inuit. A great number of Yellowknife First Nations joined Hearne&#x27;s party to accompany them to the Copper-mine River with intent to kill Inuit, who were understood to frequent that river in considerable numbers.

On 14 July 1771, they reached the Copper-mine River, a small stream flowing over a rocky bed in the &quot;Barren Lands of the Little Sticks&quot;. A few miles down the river, just above a cataract, were the domed wigwams of an Eskimo camp. At 1 am on 17 July 1771 Matonabbee and the other Indigenous peoples fell upon the sleeping &quot;Esquimaux&quot; in a ruthless massacre. Approximately twenty men, women and children were killed; this would be known as the Massacre at Bloody Falls.
... a young girl, seemingly about eighteen years of age, [was] killed so near me, that when the first spear was stuck into her side she fell down at my feet, and twisted round my legs, so that it was with difficulty that I could disengage myself from her dying grasps. As two Indian men pursued this unfortunate victim, I solicited very hard for her life; but the murderers made no reply till they had stuck both their spears through her body ... even at this hour I cannot reflect on the transactions of that horrid day without shedding tears.

A few days later, Hearne was the first European to reach the shore of the Arctic Ocean by an overland route. By tracing the Coppermine River to the Arctic Ocean he had established there was no Northwest Passage through the continent at lower latitudes.

This expedition also proved successful in its primary goal by discovering copper in the Coppermine River basin; however, an intensive search of the area yielded only one four-pound lump of copper and commercial mining was not considered viable.

Matonabbee led Hearne back to Churchill by a wide westward circle past Bear Lake in Athabasca Country. In midwinter he became the first European to see and cross Great Slave Lake. Hearne returned to Fort Prince of Wales on 30 June 1772, having walked some and explored more than .

==Later life==
Hearne was sent to Saskatchewan to establish Cumberland House, the second inland trading post for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1774 (the first being Henley House, established in 1743, up the Albany River). Having learned to live off the land, he took minimal provisions for the eight Europeans and two Home Guard Crees who accompanied him.

After consulting some local chiefs, Hearne chose a strategic site on Pine Island Lake in the Saskatchewan River, above Fort Paskoya. The site was linked to both the Saskatchewan River trade route and the Churchill system.

He became governor of Fort Prince of Wales on 22 January 1776. On 8 August 1782 Hearne and his complement of 38 civilians were confronted by a French force under the comte de La Pérouse composed of three ships, including one of 74 guns, and 290 soldiers. As a veteran Hearne recognised hopeless odds and surrendered without a shot. Hearne and some of the other prisoners were allowed to sail back to England from Hudson Strait in a small sloop.

Hearne returned the next year but found trade had deteriorated. The First Nations population had been decimated by European-introduced diseases such as measles and smallpox, as well as starvation due to the lack of normal hunting supplies of powder and shot. Matonabbee had committed suicide and the rest of Churchill&#x27;s leading First Nations had moved to other posts. Hearne&#x27;s health began to fail and he delivered up command at Churchill on 16 August 1787 and returned to England.

In the last decade of his life he used his experiences on the barrens, on the northern coast, and in the interior to help naturalists like Thomas Pennant in their researches. His friend William Wales was a teacher at Christ&#x27;s Hospital and he assisted Hearne to write &quot;A Journey from Prince of Wales&#x27;s Fort in Hudson&#x27;s Bay to the Northern Ocean&quot;. This was published in 1795, three years after Hearne&#x27;s death of dropsy in November 1792 at the age of 47.

==Legacy==

On 1 July 1767, he chiselled his name on smooth, glaciated stone at Sloop&#x27;s Cove near Fort Prince of Wales where it remains today.

One of Wales&#x27;s pupils, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, made a brief notebook entry where he mentioned Hearne&#x27;s book. Hearne may have been one of the inspirations for the &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

Hearne&#x27;s journals and maps were proven correct by Sir John Franklin when he verified the discovery of the Bloody Falls massacre during his own Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. He wrote: 
Several human skulls which bore the marks of violence, and many bones were strewed about the encampment, and as the spot exactly answers the description, given by Mr Hearne, of the place...

Hearne is mentioned by Charles Darwin in the sixth chapter of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;:

In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, like a whale, insects in the water.Samuel Hearne&#x27;s account of his exploration of the north, &quot;A Journey from Prince of Wales&#x27; Fort in Hudson&#x27;s Bay to the Northern Ocean&quot;, originally published in 1795, was edited by Joseph Tyrell and reprinted as part of the General Series of the Champlain Society.

There was a junior/senior high school named after him in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, between 1969 and 2013. A school in Toronto, Ontario, was also built in his name in 1973.

<text>William Borlase (2 February 169631 August 1772), Cornish antiquary, geologist and naturalist. From 1722, he was Rector of Ludgvan, Cornwall, where he died. He is remembered for his works &quot;The Antiquities of Cornwall&quot; (1754; 2nd ed., 1769) and &quot;The Natural History of Cornwall&quot; (1758), although his plans for a parish-by-parish county history were abandoned.

==Life and works==

Borlase was born on 2 February 1695/6 at Pendeen, of an ancient family originating at St Wenn. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, from 1713, and in 1719 he was ordained. In 1722 he was presented to the rectory of Ludgvan, and in 1732 he obtained in addition the vicarage of St Just, his native parish. The garden of the Rectory (now known as Hogus House) was established by Borlase; during the reign of Queen Victoria the garden was further developed by a successor, Arthur Boscawen, and was known for its fine collection of trees and shrubs.

Between 1744 and 1746, Borlase was active against the Methodist preachers in his capacity of magistrate. Various Methodist preachers were seized on warrants issued by him and press-ganged to serve on Royal Navy ships abroad. In &quot;John Wesley&#x27;s Diary&quot; there is an account of how Borlase personally laid hands on Wesley, &quot;to serve his majesty&quot;, but withdrew when he realised that Wesley was a gentleman.

In the parish of Ludgvan were rich copper works, abounding with mineral and metallic fossils, of which he made a collection, and thus was led to study somewhat minutely the natural history of Cornwall. In 1750, he was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society; and in 1754 he published, at Oxford, his &quot;Antiquities of Cornwall&quot; (2nd ed., London, 1769). His next publication was &quot;Observations on the Ancient and Present State of the Islands of Scilly, and their Importance to the Trade of Great Britain&quot; (Oxford, 1756). In 1758 there appeared his &quot;Natural History of Cornwall&quot; which includes a chapter on the inhabitants and their native language (about one ninth of the whole).

He presented to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, a variety of fossils and antiquities, which he had described in his works, and received the thanks of the university and the degree of Doctor of Civil Law. Borlase was well acquainted with most of the leading literary men of the time, particularly with Alexander Pope, with whom he kept up a long correspondence, and for whose grotto at Twickenham he furnished the greater part of the fossils and minerals. He also sent collections of mineral and fossil specimens to Dr William Oliver and to a number of natural historians in Europe.

==Family and character==
In 1724, William Borlase married Anne Smith. The couple had six sons, of whom two died in infancy. Of the remaining four, three became churchmen. Anne Borlase died in 1769. Borlase&#x27;s elder brother was Walter Borlase, who served as vicar of Madron, and also as mayor of Penzance. His great-great-grandson was William Copeland Borlase (1848–1899), an antiquarian who was influenced by his ancestor&#x27;s archaeological work.

Borlase was a conscientious minister to his parishioners, politically conservative, and an amateur painter. Some of his papers are preserved in Penzance at the Morrab Library.
