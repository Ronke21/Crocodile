==History==

===1958–1960s===

In 1958, LG Electronics was founded as &quot;GoldStar&quot; (). It was established in the aftermath of the Korean War to provide the rebuilding nation with domestically produced consumer electronics and home appliances. The start of the country&#x27;s national broadcasting that created a booming electronics market and a close relationship it quickly forged with Hitachi helped &quot;GoldStar&quot; to produce South Korea&#x27;s first radios, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners. &quot;GoldStar&quot; was one of the LG groups with a brethren company, Lak-Hui (pronounced &quot;Lucky&quot;) Chemical Industrial Corp. which is now LG Chem and LG Household &amp; Health Care. &quot;GoldStar&quot; merged with Lucky Chemical and GoldStar Cable on 28 February 1995, changing the corporate name to Lucky-Goldstar and then finally to LG Electronics.

===1970s–1990s===
Goldstar first went public in 1970; by 1976, it was producing one million televisions annually. In 1982, Goldstar opened its first overseas factory, which was based in Huntsville, Alabama.
In 1994, &quot;GoldStar&quot; officially adopted the LG Electronics brand and a new corporate logo. In 1995, LG Electronics acquired the US-based TV manufacturer Zenith and absorbed it four years later. Also in that year, LG Electronics made the world&#x27;s first CDMA digital mobile handsets and supplied Ameritech and GTE in the US, the LGC-330W digital cellular phone. The company was also awarded UL certification in the US. In 1998, LG developed the world&#x27;s first 60-inch plasma TV and established a joint venture in 1999 with Philips LG.Philips LCD which now goes by the name LG Display. In 1999, LG Semiconductor merged with Hynix.

===2000s–present===
In order to create a holding company, the former LG Electronics was split off in 2002, with the &quot;new&quot; LG Electronics being spun off and the &quot;old&quot; LG Electronics changing its name to LG EI. It was then merged with and into LG CI in 2003 (the legal successor of the former LG Chem), so the company that started as &quot;GoldStar&quot; does not exist.

LG Electronics plays a large role in the global consumer electronics industry; it was the second-largest LCD TV manufacturer worldwide as of 2013. By 2005, LG was a Top 100 global brand and recorded a brand growth of 14% in 2006. As of 2009, its display manufacturing affiliate, LG Display, was the world&#x27;s largest LCD panel manufacturer. In 2010, LG Electronics entered the smartphone industry. LG Electronics has since continued to develop various electronic products, such as releasing the world&#x27;s first 84-inch ultra-HD TV for retail sale.

On 5 December 2012, the antitrust regulators of the European Union fined LG Electronics and five other major companies (Samsung, Thomson since 2010 known as Technicolor, Matsushita which today is Panasonic Corp, Philips and Toshiba) for fixing prices of TV cathode-ray tubes in two cartels lasting nearly a decade.

On 11 June 2015, LG Electronics found itself in the midst of a human rights controversy when &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article by Rosa Moreno, a former employee of an LG television assembly factory. Moreno was offered $3800 in compensation after losing both hands in an industrial accident while working for a subcontrator making parts for LG-branded flatscreen televisons.

At the end of 2016, LG Electronics merged its German branch (situated in Ratingen) and European headquarter (situated in London) together in Eschborn, a suburb of Frankfurt am Main.

In March 2017, LG Electronics was sued for its handling of hardware failures with recent smartphones such as the LG G4.

Koo Bon-joon, who was the CEO and the current vice chairman of LG Electronics, was replaced by his nephew Koo Kwang-mo in July 2018 as CEO and vice chairman. The move came after the succession of Koo Kwang-mo as the chairman of the parent company LG Corporation who succeeded his adoptive father and uncle Koo Bon-moo after Bon-moo died of a brain tumor on 20 May 2018.

LG announced in November 2018 that Hwang Jeong-hwan, who took the job as president of LG Mobile Communications in October 2017, will be replaced by Brian Kwon, who is head of LG&#x27;s hugely profitable home entertainment business, from 1 December 2018. Also in 2018, LG decided to stop smartphone production in South Korea to move production to Vietnam, in order to stay competitive. LG said Vietnam provides an &quot;abundant labor force&quot; and that 750 workers at its South Korean handset factory would be relocated to its home appliance plant.

On 5 April 2021, LG announced its withdrawal from the phone manufacturing industry after continuous loss in the market. In 2020, LG faced a loss of 5 trillion won (US$4.4 billion).

In June 2021, the YouTube channel Hardware Unboxed published a video alleging an attempt by a representative of LG to manipulate the review of one of LG&#x27;s gaming monitors. The representative, in an email shown in the video, attempts to influence the editorial outcome of the review by indicating testing methods and aspects of the display to be followed by the channel. This came a few months after a similar incident between the creators and Nvidia in which Nvidia warned them that if they continue emphasizing on rasterization rather than ray tracing in Nvidia&#x27;s graphics cards, they would no longer receive review samples.

As of 1 December 2021, the Chief Strategy Officer William Cho will take over for Bong-seok Kwon as the CEO of LG Electronics.

In June 2022, LG acquired AppleMango, a South Korean EV charger manufacturer with a 60% purchase of the company&#x27;s stocks

In that same month, the American publication Consumer Reports rated LG home appliances as the most reliable in the U.S. consumer market.

In April 2024, a security firm discovered security bugs in tens of thousands of LG smart TV models that could &quot;let hackers hijack them&quot;. The vulnerability particularly affects smart TVs running LG&#x27;s WebOS operating system from version 4 to version 7.

==Corporate governance==
===Logo evolution===
===COVID-19 response===
On 25 December 2021, LG Electronics launched a video campaign showing some of the initiatives the company has taken in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. The video shows how the company has handled the pandemic from the beginning by encouraging good hygiene practices to include social distancing, hand-washing, mask wearing, and using hand sanitizers.

In a strategy to cope with demand for contactless shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, LG Electronics has opened a number of unmanned stores that allow for customers to authenticate themselves at the main entrance, check product information, and purchase products using a mobile phone or QR code. The company operates nine unmanned stores and this will increase to 30 by the end of June 2022. These retail locations are only available in South Korea.

===United States headquarters===
In 2013, LG Electronics USA proposed building a new headquarters in the borough of Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, New Jersey, including a tall building that would stand taller than the tree line of the Hudson Palisades, a US National Natural Landmark. The company proposed to build an environmentally friendly facility in Englewood Cliffs, incidental to Bergen County&#x27;s per-capita leading Korean American population, having received an initially favorable legal decision concerning building height issues. The plan, while approved by the local government, met with resistance from the segments of the general public as well as government officials in New Jersey and adjacent New York. The initial court decision upholding the local government approval was overturned by a New Jersey appellate court in 2015 and LG subsequently submitted a revised, scaled-down, 64-foot building for approval by the borough of Englewood Cliffs in 2016. LG broke ground on the new US$300 million Englewood Cliffs headquarters on 7 February 2017, to be completed in late 2019.

==Products==
LG Electronics products include televisions including hospitality televisions for hotels and commercial industrials, home theater systems, home audio, portable audio and headphones, refrigerators, washing machines, computer monitors, wearable devices, solar modules, vehicle audio and displays, smart appliances and formerly smartphones.

===Televisions===

The LG SL9000 was one of several new Borderless HDTV&#x27;s advertised for release at IFA Berlin in 2009. LG Electronics launched an OLED TV in 2013 and 65-inch and 77-inch sizes in 2014. LG Electronics introduced its first Internet TV in 2007, originally branded as &quot;Net Cast Entertainment Access&quot; devices. They later renamed the 2011 Internet televisions to &quot;LG Smart TV&quot; when more interactive television features were added, that enable the audience to receive information from the Internet while watching conventional TV programming.

In November 2013, a blogger discovered that some of LG&#x27;s smart TVs silently collect filenames from attached USB storage devices and program viewing data, and transmit the information to LG&#x27;s servers and LG-affiliated servers. Shortly after this blog entry went live, LG disabled playback on its site of the video, explaining how its viewer analytics work, and closed the Brightcove account the video was hosted on.

LG manufactures remote control models that use Hillcrest Labs&#x27; Freespace technology to allow users to change channels using gestures and Dragon NaturallySpeaking technology for voice recognition.

As of 2014, LG is using webOS with a ribbon interface with some of its smart TVs. LG reported that in the first eight months after release, it had sold over 5 million webOS TVs.

In 2016, exclusively to India, Indian arm of South Korea&#x27;s LG Electronics Inc started selling a TV that would repel mosquitoes. It uses ultrasonic waves that are silent to humans but cause mosquitoes to fly away. It was released on 16 June 2016. The technology was also used in air conditioners and washing machines. The TV is aimed for lower-income consumers living in conditions that would make them susceptible to mosquitoes.

In 2018, it was reported that LG was planning to sell big-screen televisions that could be rolled up and retract automatically with the push of a button come 2019.

===Mobile devices===
In April 2021, LG officially confirmed that it will shut down its mobile division. Earlier, there had been rumours that LG considered selling its mobile division with Vingroup and Volkswagen named as potential buyers.

Other than mobile phones, LG Electronics have also made tablet computers like the LG G series complementing the mobile phones. LG also makes laptop computers in the LG Gram line, and previously under the Xnote line (see List of LG laptops).

====Mobile phones====
LG Electronics used to manufacture mobile phones from 1995 to 2021, selling to the domestic market only (as Cyon) until 2000. It was in the shadow of Samsung Anycall but LG made its breakthrough during the mid and late 2000s: it launched its highly popular LG Chocolate in worldwide in 2006 which popularised touch-sensitivity. The following year it released the world&#x27;s first capacitive touchscreen phone LG Prada, and Shine, cementing its focus on design: its phones during this era have led to LG being called alongside Apple as one of the pioneers of the rise of touchscreens. By 2008 LG had entered the top 3 worldwide leaders in mobile phones.

There was further success with the Cookie which helped to bring touchscreens to the budget market, and with the Lollipop flip phone that became very popular in South Korea. However the company had trouble with competing in smartphones. In 2010, LG released the Optimus smartphone, which would span into a series. The following year saw the release of the LG Optimus 3D, the world&#x27;s first mobile phone with glasses-free 3D display, and LG Optimus 2X, the first with a dual-core processor. In 2012 LG worked with Google to build the Nexus 4 smartphone.

On 7 September 2016, LG unveiled the V20, and the V30 was announced on 31 August 2017. LG G6 was officially announced during MWC 2017 on 26 February 2017. The G7 ThinQ model was announced at a 2 May 2018 media briefing. In 2020, the LG Wing was introduced with two displays and a swivel design.

In April 2021, after months of speculation, LG confirmed that the smartphone division will be officially shut down in July 2021. The decision to shut down LG Mobile came about from poor sales caused by stiff competition from rival Samsung and Chinese brands such as Oppo and Xiaomi. LG became the first major smartphone brand to completely withdraw from the market.

====Smart watches====

LG and Google announced the Android Wear-based smartwatch, the LG G Watch, that was in June 2014. In August 2014, the LG G Watch R that has a circular face (similar to the Moto 360) was released.

Users can send simple messages, such as &quot;start washing cycle,&quot; in order to control their washing machines.

In December 2021, LG Electronics announced they were testing an ecologically friendly washing machine that uses liquid carbon dioxide as a cleaner.

Warner had an agreement with the company in 2014 and his contract had been planned for renewal.

==Environmental record==
In 2010, independent tests of popular LG fridge models conducted by Choice magazine found the energy consumption in two models was higher than claimed by LG. LG was aware of the problem and offered compensation to affected customers. In 2004, LG made 4A-rated water efficiency claims for numerous washing machines before they were certified. LG gave undertakings to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission to provide appropriate corrective notices and upgrade and maintain its trade practices compliance program. In 2006, LG overstated energy efficiency on five of its air conditioner models and was again required to offer consumers rebates to cover the extra energy costs.

In May 2020, a deadly gas leak in LG chemical plant in Visakhapatnam killed 12 people. An investigation was set up to look upon the matter revealed many causes for the accident. Improper storage design, haphazard maintenance of the old storage tank, the temperature inside the oldest of the three storage tanks holding styrene monomer, a chemical used in making polystyrene products, rose to more than six times the permitted level due to polymerization, which resulted in the rise of heat due to the chemical reaction are the few causes. It was also suggested to move the company to a less populated area.

<text>David Earl Garrison (born June 30, 1952) is an American actor and singer. He is best known for playing Steve Rhoades on the television series &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. He has also appeared in numerous theatrical roles, particularly that of The Wizard on both Broadway and in many tours of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;.

==Early life==
Garrison was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, the son of Earl B. Garrison, a school administrator and Maude B. Garrison, a teacher.

Garrison graduated from Freehold High School in 1970, where he began his acting career on the school&#x27;s stage. He was inducted in the school&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2007. Garrison graduated summa cum laude from Boston University&#x27;s College of Fine Arts in 1974. Following graduation, he became a member of the resident company at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. for several years.

==Career==
Although he is known for his television roles and continues to appear frequently in guest-starring roles on television today, Garrison is primarily a theatre actor, particularly in musicals. He has appeared in numerous productions around the United States, including many Broadway shows. His Broadway appearances include &quot;A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine&quot; for which he received a Tony Award nomination, &quot;Wicked&quot;, &quot;The Visit&quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, &quot;Bells Are Ringing, A History of the American Film&quot;&quot;,&quot; and &quot;The Great Society&quot;. His Off-Broadway credits include &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot;&quot;,&quot; for which he received a Drama Desk Award nomination, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;&quot;, Middletown&quot;&quot;, New Jerusalem&quot;&quot;, Geniuses&quot;&quot;, It’s Only a Play&quot;&quot;, By the Way Meet Vera Stark&quot;, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, and &quot;Silence! The Musical&quot;. In addition to the cast albums of &quot;Hollywood/Ukraine&quot;&quot;, Titanic&quot;&quot;, Bells Are Ringing&quot;&quot;, The Visit&quot;&quot;, I Do! I Do!&quot;, and &quot;On the Town&quot;, his many recordings include &quot;Songs of New York&quot;&quot;, Show Boat&quot;&quot;, Kiss Me Kate&quot;&quot;, Annie Get Your Gun&quot;&quot;, Of Thee I Sing/Let ’Em Eat Cake&quot;&quot;, Girl Crazy&quot;&quot;, You Never Know&quot;&quot;, Tell Me More&quot;&quot;, Oh! Lady! Lady!!&quot;, &quot;George and Ira Standards and Gems&quot;, and, as a guest artist, &quot;Dawn Upshaw Sings Rodgers and Hart&quot;.”.

On tour, Garrison played Nathan Detroit in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and the Wizard in &quot;Wicked&quot;, for which he received a Carbonell Award. In regional theatre, he has played the Devil in &quot;Randy Newman&#x27;s Faust (La Jolla/Goodman)&quot;, Henry Carr in &quot;Travesties&quot; (Williamstown), Frosch in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (Santa Fe Opera), Pangloss in &quot;Candide&quot; (Glimmerglass), Gaston in &quot;You Never Know&quot; (Pasadena Playhouse), Fagin in &quot;Oliver&quot; (Paper Mill Playhouse), Leonardo da Vinci in &quot;Ever After&quot; (Alliance Theatre), and Charley in the Arena Stage revival of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; for which he received a Helen Hayes Award. In London, he starred with Tyne Daly, Frederica Von Stade, Kurt Ollmann, and Thomas Hampson in a concert presentation of &quot;On the Town&quot;, which was broadcast on Great Performances for PBS. In 2015, he reprised the role of Police Sergeant in the New York City Center production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;.

Garrison has also appeared in numerous roles on television. In 1984–85, he starred as Norman Lamb on the sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot;, opposite Jason Bateman. In 1987, Garrison landed his best-known role, portraying Steve Rhoades, next-door neighbor to the Bundy family on the popular sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.

Garrison enjoyed his years playing Steve Rhoades, but he missed performing in live theatre, and left the show after four seasons. He was a regular on an NBC sitcom, &quot;Working It Out&quot;, shortly after his exit from &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. Nonetheless, Garrison parted on good terms, returning four times in subsequent seasons (and the reunion special) detailing the career Rhoades had pursued since he&#x27;d last been seen. He even parodied his own role on the show &quot;Nikki&quot;.

Other television credits include &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;&quot;, Madam Secretary&quot;&quot;, The West Wing, 30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Op-Center&quot;, &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and, for PBS &quot;Great Performances&quot;, &quot;On the Town&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra and &quot;Ira Gershwin at 100: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall&quot;. Garrison also participated in several installments of &quot;Pyramid&quot; as a celebrity guest, most notably helping a contestant win $100,000 during a Tournament episode of 
&quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; in 1988 .

===&quot;Wicked&quot;===
He had the role of The Wizard in the first national tour of &quot;Wicked&quot; when it began in the States (after it had started a run on Broadway) on March 8, 2005, finishing his year-long run on March 6, 2006. He then starred as the Wizard in the Broadway company from April 4, 2006 replacing Ben Vereen. After 15 months in the role he played his final performance on July 8, 2007. Then he temporarily starred in the Chicago company from September 30–October 28, 2007, and then starred in the Los Angeles company beginning August 26, 2008, until its closure on January 11, 2009. He played the role in the San Francisco production, which officially opened on February 6, 2009 and played his final performance with the production on May 31, 2009 in order to pursue a role in a new play.

He is best known for his portrayal of Dean Winchester in The WB/CW dark fantasy drama series &quot;Supernatural&quot; (2005–2020) and appearing in television series such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Eric Brady (earning him several Daytime Emmy Award nominations), super soldiers Ben/X5-493 and Alec/X5-494 in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, Jason Teague in The WB/CW&#x27;s &quot;Smallville&quot; and Ben/Soldier Boy in Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s &quot;The Boys&quot;.

==Early life==
Ackles was born in Dallas, the son of Donna Joan (born Shaffer) and Alan Roger Ackles, an actor. He grew up in Richardson and attended Lloyd V. Berkner High School. After graduating in 1996, he moved to Los Angeles to begin his acting career.

==Career==
After modeling on and off since the age of four, Ackles began to concentrate on an acting career in 1996. He appeared in several guest roles on &quot;Mr. Rhodes&quot;, &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; and &quot;Cybill&quot; before joining the cast of the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Eric Brady in 1997. He won a 1998 Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer and went on to be nominated three times (in 1998, 1999 and 2000) for a Daytime Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series&quot; for his work on &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;.

Ackles left &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; in 2000 and went on to appear in the mini-series &quot;Blonde&quot;, about the life of Marilyn Monroe. He also auditioned for the role of the young Clark Kent on &quot;Smallville&quot;, a role offered to actor Tom Welling instead. Next he appeared in a guest role on the James Cameron television series &quot;Dark Angel&quot; on Fox in 2001 as serial killer Ben/X5-493, the brother of main character Max/X5-452 (played by Jessica Alba), and returned to the show as a series regular in the second season as Ben&#x27;s sane clone, Alec/X5-494. He remained with the show until its cancellation in 2002.

Ackles worked steadily throughout 2003. He joined the cast of The WB&#x27;s hit show &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; during its final season, playing CJ, Jen Lindley&#x27;s lover.

Ackles was the producer&#x27;s first choice to play Eliza Dushku&#x27;s love interest on the second season of &quot;Tru Calling&quot;; Ackles however, turned down the role, which was then offered to Eric Christian Olsen and the character&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Jensen&quot; because the producers liked Ackles&#x27; name. Ackles returned to Vancouver (where &quot;Dark Angel&quot; was filmed) in 2004 to become a regular on &quot;Smallville&quot; playing the assistant football coach Jason Teague, who was also the newest romantic interest for Lana Lang (played by Kristin Kreuk). He also had a lead role in the 2005 film &quot;Devour&quot; in which Ackles&#x27; father, Alan Ackles, also had a role playing the father of Ackles&#x27; character, Jake Gray.

In 2018, Ackles collaborated with musician Steve Carlson to form Radio Company. Together Ackles and Carlson completed a debut album entitled &quot;Vol. 1&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single was released on iTunes and the album was released in November 2019. Ackles and Carlson released &quot;Vol. 2&quot; on May 7, 2021. Their third album, &quot;Keep on Ramblin&quot;&#x27;, was released on 24 February 2023.

He later portrayed a version of Soldier Boy in the &quot;Jumanji&quot; episode of the show&#x27;s spin-off &quot;Gen V&quot; who is an imaginary friend of Cate Dunlap.

More recently, he and his wife formed Chaos Machine Productions with a deal at Warner Bros. Television. In June 2021, it was revealed that they were developing a &quot;Supernatural&quot; prequel spinoff for The CW, titled &quot;The Winchesters&quot;, about young John and Mary Winchester, Sam and Dean&#x27;s parents. Ackles would serve as narrator, reprising his role as Dean. It was picked up in May 2022.

In October 2021, Ackles was cast to play U.S. Marshal Wood Helm in the Western feature &quot;Rust&quot;, written and directed by Joel Souza.

<text>Sir Joseph Prestwich (12 March 1812 – 23 June 1896) was a British geologist and businessman, known as an expert on the Tertiary Period and for having confirmed the findings of Boucher de Perthes of ancient flint tools in the Somme valley gravel beds.

== Biography ==
Born in Clapham, Prestwich was educated in Paris and Reading before entering University College, London where he studied chemistry and natural philosophy. Whilst a student he founded the short-lived Zetetical Society. In 1830, he began working for the family wine business. This job required him to travel throughout the United Kingdom and also abroad to France and Belgium, and during the course of these travels he made many geological observations. He became a Fellow of Geological Society in 1833 and published his first paper there two years later. His 1836 memoir on the &quot;Geology of Coalbrookdale&quot;, based upon observations made during 1831 and 1832, established his reputation as a geologist.

From 1846, his attention focused upon the Tertiary deposits of the London Basin, which he subsequently classified and then correlated with Tertiary deposits throughout England, France and Belgium. In 1858, Prestwich was persuaded by Hugh Falconer to visit Abbeville, where Boucher de Perthes had claimed to have found flint tools in the gravel deposits of the valley of the Somme, thus establishing the antiquity of man. In company with Sir John Evans, Prestwich visited the gravel beds of St Acheul and confirmed the observations of Boucher de Perthes. Prestwich&#x27;s report on the matter was published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; for 1859-1860: It is claimed by some authorities that this publication marks the birth of modern scientific archaeology.

During the late 1860s, Prestwich served on the Royal Coal Commission and the Royal Commission on the Metropolitan Water Supply. In 1870–72, he was president of the Geological Society. In 1874, he was appointed to the chair of geology at the University of Oxford. Here he produced in two volumes &quot;Geology, Chemical and Physical, Stratigraphical and Palaeontological&quot;. In 1888, he retired from Oxford to Shoreham, Kent where he continued to work until his death in 1896. Prestwich was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1853, awarded its Royal Medal in 1865, awarded a Telford Medal for a paper entitled &quot;On the Geological Conditions affecting the Construction of a Tunnel between England and France&quot;, in 1873. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1869. Knighted in 1896, he married Grace Anne McCall, the niece of Hugh Falconer, in 1870.

==Early life==
Manheim was born in West Caldwell, New Jersey, into a Jewish family, the daughter of Sylvia (née Nuchow), a teacher, and Jerome Manheim, a mathematics professor and the Dean of Letters and Science at California State University Long Beach. Her family relocated several times in her early childhood due to her father taking new teaching positions, and she spent her early years in Michigan and Peoria, Illinois. 

When she was in sixth grade, her family relocated to Southern California, settling in Long Beach, where she attended Woodrow Wilson Classical High School. She became interested in acting after working at a Renaissance faire during high school. Manheim graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a BFA degree in 1984 and New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts Graduate Acting Program with an MFA degree in 1987. Her brother, Karl Manheim, is a law professor at Loyola Law School.

==Career==

Manheim worked for a while as a sign language interpreter at hospitals. Her knowledge of sign language was used on &quot;The Practice&quot;, in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episodes &quot;Benevolence&quot; (1993) and &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; (2024), and in her role as a child behavioral psychologist in the movie &quot;Mercury Rising&quot;. In 1983, she made a brief appearance as a girl in an elevator in &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; in the post-courtroom scene at the beginning.

Manheim&#x27;s breakthrough was her one-woman show &quot;Wake Up, I&#x27;m Fat&quot;, which played off-Broadway at Classic Stage Company in 1994. She adapted the show into a book of the same name, which was published by Broadway Books in 1999.

In 1999, Manheim won an Emmy for her work on &quot;The Practice&quot;. In 1999, she was awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award.

==Personal life==
Manheim&#x27;s son Milo, conceived via sperm donation from her close friend Jeffrey Brezovar, was born on March 6, 2001.

Manheim has been involved with the Los Angeles–based charity Bet Tzedek Legal Services – The House of Justice, serving as a co-chair for their annual fundraiser, the Justice Ball.

<text>What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape is a 1993 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Lasse Hallström, and starring Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis, Mary Steenburgen, Leonardo DiCaprio, and John C. Reilly. It follows a grocery store clerk, living with his dysfunctional family including his morbidly obese mother, his mentally disabled younger brother and two sisters, in the fictional rural town of Endora, Iowa. 

Peter Hedges wrote the screenplay, based on his 1991 novel of the same name. Filming took place from November 1992 to January 1993 in various parts of Texas.

The film was well received, with Depp and DiCaprio&#x27;s performances garnering critical acclaim. At age 19, DiCaprio received his first nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, becoming the seventh-youngest Best Supporting Actor nominee for the former.

==Plot==
In the small town of Endora, Iowa, Gilbert Grape is busy caring for Arnie, his mentally disabled younger brother who is about to turn 18, as they wait for the many tourists&#x27; trailers to pass through town during an annual Airstreamers&#x27; Club gathering at a nearby recreational area. His father had lost his business or money seventeen years earlier and committed suicide two years after. Since then, his mother, Bonnie, has spent most of her days on the couch watching television and eating. With Bonnie&#x27;s obesity leaving her unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house that his father built and being protective of Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town&#x27;s water tower, as well as trees, while his sisters, Amy and Ellen, do the other housework. Gilbert had an older brother named Larry who moved away some years ago. A new FoodLand supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson&#x27;s Grocery where Gilbert works.

Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman to whom he delivers groceries. When her husband finds out, there&#x27;s a horrible scene involving Gilbert, the man&#x27;s children, and their wading pool. The husband later dies from a heart attack and drowning in the wading pool.

A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when the International Harvester Travelall pulling their trailer breaks down. Gilbert&#x27;s unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. To spend time with Becky to watch the sunset, Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bath. He returns home late and finds Arnie still in the bath the following morning, shivering in the now-cold water; his guilt is compounded by his family&#x27;s anger and Arnie&#x27;s subsequent aquaphobia. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie. While they are distracted during one of their talks, Arnie returns to the water tower that he is always trying to climb. Arnie is arrested after being rescued from the top of the tower, causing Bonnie — who has not left the house in more than seven years — to become the laughing stock of the town as she goes to the police station, forcing Arnie&#x27;s release.

Soon, Arnie ruins two birthday cakes: the first, when he runs into Amy and she drops the cake she has lovingly made; and the second, a replacement from FoodLand, which he dips his fingers in to, having found it in the refrigerator. Arnie tries to run away from his bath, and in his frustration, Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert flees, driving away in his truck. Arnie also runs to Becky, who takes care of him for the evening, and helps him overcome his aquaphobia, until he is picked up by his sisters. After some soul-searching, aided by Becky, Gilbert returns home during Arnie&#x27;s 18th birthday party to make amends to his family for running out, and to receive Arnie&#x27;s reluctant forgiveness. He also apologizes to his mother for his behavior, and vows not to be ashamed of her or let her be hurt anymore. She acknowledges how much of a burden that she has become to the family, and he forgives her. Gilbert also introduces Bonnie to Becky, something he had been reluctant to do.

Following the party, Bonnie climbs the stairs to her bedroom for the first time since her husband&#x27;s suicide. Arnie tries to wake her, but discovers that she has died. With no way to remove her body from the second floor, the police make plans to return with a crane the next day. The family instinctively knows that there will be a crowd of people there to get a laugh, instead of paying their respects. Wanting to keep her death from becoming a mockery, the family removes the furniture and belongings from the house, and Gilbert sets the house ablaze with Bonnie still inside as a funeral pyre.

A year later, Amy gets a job managing a bakery in the Des Moines area, while Ellen looks forward to switching schools and living in a bigger city. Gilbert waits by the side of the road with Arnie, whose 19th birthday is coming up, waiting for the tourist trailers to come again. As part of the convoy, Becky arrives with her grandmother and picks them both up. Gilbert tells Arnie, &quot;We can go anywhere.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
Filming for &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; began November 2, 1992, and concluded in late January 1993. It was shot in Texas, in various towns and cities; Austin and Pflugerville were primary locations, as well as Manor, where the water tower featured in the film was located. Christian Bale was up for the part of Arnie, but lost to DiCaprio.

&quot;Film Review&quot; quoted actor Leonardo DiCaprio:

==Reception==
The film had a limited release December 17, 1993, and wide release March 4, 1994. The wide release garnered $2,104,938 in its first weekend. It was considered a box-office bomb, with the total domestic gross for the film of $10,032,765, although it achieved greater success on home video.

The film received positive reviews, with many critics praising the performances by Depp and DiCaprio. The latter was singled out for his performance in the film, many saying that DiCaprio stole the film from the lead actor, Depp. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film was given a 90% score, and an average rating of 7.40/10, based on 50 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;It&#x27;s sentimental and somewhat predictable, but those are small complaints, given the tender atmosphere and moving performances at the heart of &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;.&quot; Metacritic calculated an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic, Janet Maslin, praised DiCaprio&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;The film&#x27;s real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio, who makes Arnie&#x27;s many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch... The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described it as &quot;one of the most enchanting films of the year,&quot; and said that DiCaprio deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for which he was nominated.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; found the film a &quot;bemused view on life&quot;, and remarked that &quot;Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Desson Howe thought that the film was an earnest but highly predictable effort.

&quot;Film Review&quot; praised Leonardo DiCaprio as the mentally disabled brother, calling it &quot;a performance of astonishing innocence and spontaneity,&quot; bringing &quot;a touching credibility to a very difficult part.&quot;

It is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It can be used on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and other systems based on POSIX-X11. The first official release was made on May 10, 2004. The software was often used to run early versions of OS X on Windows XP computers.

== History ==
PearPC was released in May of 2004 by developers Sebastian Biallas and Stefan Wyergraf. Original releases were noted for being slow and unstable, but were still well received by the community. On July 6, 2004, Wyergraf was killed by a train, but development continued. The last current version of PearPC was 0.5.0, released on July 12, 2015. One of the reasons given for the development slowing down after 2005 was Apple&#x27;s transition from PowerPC to x86 architecture.

== Features ==
PearPC only runs on x86 systems including Intel and AMD such as Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and ReactOS. The emulator features a just-in-time (JIT) processor emulation core which dynamically translates PPC code into x86 code, caching the results. The original release emulated a G3 chip. The emulator shipped with the ability to run Mac OS X 10.3, OpenBSD for PowerPC, NetBSD for PowerPC, Darwin for PowerPC and Mandrake Linux 9.1, though it was noted that the emulated operating systems could be up to 40 times slower than the host. This speed was later brought up, running around 10 times slower than the host. It could run all the regular Mac applications such as Finder, Safari, QuickTime, and Terminal. The emulator can run Mac OS X versions 10.1 through 10.4 but cannot run 10.5 Leopard or above. Support for the G4 chip was later added.

==Shortcomings==
The current official version of Pear PC is 0.5.0 (released on July 12, 2015). While its PowerPC emulation handles most applications, the project still lacks several components needed for a complete emulation of the PowerPC experience. Sound emulation, G5 chip emulation, .dmg support, and OS X Leopard support were not included in this release. The installation was sometimes noted as complicated, requiring editing of configuration files and the use of the command line.
==CherryOS controversy==

A commercial PowerPC emulator called CherryOS was released soon after the launch of PearPC, in March 2005, claiming to offer more features and greater speed. However, within hours of its announcement, questions were raised about the claims, with some people suggesting that Cherry OS was nothing more than a repackaging of PearPC. According to Cassondra Foesch, a principal author of PearPC, it still contained all or part of the code written for the PearPC Project. Cherry OS also created questions regarding the legality of commercial software developed and marketed specifically to run macOS on the x86 architecture, since Apple&#x27;s license agreement specifically states that the operating system may only be installed on Apple-labeled computers. On April 6, 2005, the distribution of Cherry OS temporarily put on hold due to criticism. It was later released as open source on May 1, 2005.

<doc id="656613" wikidata="Q2477534" url="?curid=656613" title="Cytoplasmic streaming">
<text>Cytoplasmic streaming, also called protoplasmic streaming and cyclosis, is the flow of the cytoplasm inside the cell, driven by forces from the cytoskeleton. It is likely that its function is, at least in part, to speed up the transport of molecules and organelles around the cell. It is usually observed in large plant and animal cells, greater than approximately 0.1 mm. In smaller cells, the diffusion of molecules is more rapid, but diffusion slows as the size of the cell increases, so larger cells may need cytoplasmic streaming for efficient function.

The green alga genus &quot;Chara&quot; possesses some very large cells, up to 10 cm in length, and cytoplasmic streaming has been studied in these large cells.

Cytoplasmic streaming is strongly dependent upon intracellular pH and temperature. It has been observed that the effect of temperature on cytoplasmic streaming created linear variance and dependence at different high temperatures in comparison to low temperatures. This process is complicated, with temperature alterations in the system increasing its efficiency, with other factors such as the transport of ions across the membrane being simultaneously affected. This is due to cells homeostasis depending upon active transport which may be affected at some critical temperatures.

In plant cells, chloroplasts are transported within the cytoplasmic stream to optimize their exposure to light for photosynthesis. This rate of motion is influenced by several factors including light intensity, temperature, and pH levels. Cytoplasmic streaming is most efficient at a neutral pH and tends to decrease in efficiency under conditions of both low and high pH.

Several methods exist to halt the flow of cytoplasm within cells. One approach involves the introduction of Lugol&#x27;s iodine solution, which effectively immobilizes the cytoplasmic streaming. Alternatively, the compound Cytochalasin D, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, can be employed to achieve a similar effect by disrupting the actin microfilaments responsible for facilitating cytoplasmic movement.

== Mechanism ==

What is clearly visible in plants cells which exhibit cytoplasmic streaming is the motion of the chloroplasts moving with the cytoplasmic flow. This motion results from fluid being entrained by moving motor molecules of the plant cell. Myosin filaments connect cell organelles to actin filaments. These actin filaments are generally attached to the chloroplasts and/or membranes of plant cells. As the myosin molecules &quot;walk&quot; along the actin filaments dragging the organelles with them, the cytoplasmic fluid becomes entrained and is pushed/pulled along. Cytoplasmic flow rates can range between 1 and 100 micron/sec.

=== In &quot;Chara corallina&quot; ===

&quot;Chara corallina&quot; exhibits cyclic cytoplasmic flow around a large central vacuole. The large central vacuole is one of the largest organelles in a plant cell and is generally used for storage. In &quot;Chara coralina&quot;, cells can grow up to 10 cm long and 1 mm in diameter. The diameter of the vacuole can occupy around 80% of the cell&#x27;s diameter. Thus for a 1 mm diameter cell, the vacuole can have a diameter of 0.8 mm, leaving only a path width of about 0.1 mm around the vacuole for cytoplasm to flow. The cytoplasm flows at a rate of 100 microns/sec, the fastest of all known cytoplasmic streaming phenomena.

===Characteristics===

The flow of the cytoplasm in the cell of &quot;Chara corallina&quot; is belied by the &quot;barber pole&quot; movement of the chloroplasts. Two sections of chloroplast flow are observed with the aid of a microscope. These sections are arranged helically along the longitudinal axis of the cell. In one section, the chloroplasts move upward along one band of the helix, while in the other, the chloroplasts move downwardly. The area between these sections are known as indifferent zones. Chloroplasts are never seen to cross these zones, and as a result it was thought that cytoplasmic and vacuolar fluid flow are similarly restricted, but this is not true.

First, Kamiya and Kuroda, experimentally determined that cytoplasmic flow rate varies radially within the cell, a phenomenon not clearly depicted by the chloroplast movement. Second, Raymond Goldstein and others developed a mathematical fluid model for the cytoplasmic flow which not only predicts the behavior noted by Kamiya and Kuroda, but predicts the trajectories of cytoplasmic flow through indifferent zones. The Goldstein model ignores the vacuolar membrane, and simply assumes that shear forces are directly translated to the vacuolar fluid from the cytoplasm. 

The Goldstein model predicts there is net flow toward one of the indifferent zones from the other. This actually is suggested by the flow of the chloroplasts. At one indifferent zone, the section with the chloroplasts moving at a downward angle will be above the chloroplasts moving at an upward angle. This section is known as the minus indifferent zone (IZ-). Here, if each direction is broken into components in the theta (horizontal) and z (vertical) directions, the sum of these components oppose each other in the z direction, and similarly diverges in theta direction. The other indifferent zone has the upwardly angled chloroplast movement on top and is known as the positive indifferent zone (IZ+). Thus, while the z directional components oppose each other again, the theta components now converge. The net effect of the forces is cytoplasmic/vacuolar flow moves from the minus indifferent zone to the positive indifferent zone. 

As stated, these directional components are suggested by chloroplast movement, but are not obvious. Further, the effect of this cytoplasmic/vacuolar flow from one indifferent zone to the other demonstrates that cytoplasmic particles do cross the indifferent zones even if the chloroplasts at the surface do not. Particles, as they rise in the cell, spiral around in a semicircular manner near the minus indifferent zone, cross one indifferent zone, and end up near a positive indifferent zone. 

Further experiments on the Characean cells support of the Goldstein model for vacuolar fluid flow. However, due to the vacuolar membrane (which was ignored in the Goldstein model), the cytoplasmic flow follows a different flow pattern. Further, recent experiments have shown that the data collected by Kamiya and Kuroda which suggested a flat velocity profile in the cytoplasm are not fully accurate. Kikuchi worked with &quot;Nitella flexillis&quot; cells, and found an exponential relationship between fluid flow velocity and distance from cell membrane. Although this work is not on &quot;Chara&quot; cells, the flows between &quot;Nitella flexillis&quot; and &quot;Chara coralina&quot; are visually and structurally similar.

== Advantages ==

=== Enhanced nutrient transport ===

The Goldstein model predicts enhanced transport (over transport characterized by strictly longitudinal cytoplasmic flow) into the vacuolar cavity due to the complicated flow trajectories arising from the cytoplasmic streaming. Although, a nutrient concentration gradient would result from longitudinally uniform concentrations and flows, the complicated flow trajectories predicted produce a larger concentration gradient across the vacuolar membrane. 

By Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion, it is known that larger concentration gradients lead to larger diffusive flows. Thus, the unique flow trajectories of the cytoplasmic flow in &quot;Chara coralina&quot; lead to enhanced nutrient transport by diffusion into the storage vacuole. This allows for higher concentrations of nutrients inside the vacuole than would be allowed by strictly longitudinal cytoplasmic flows. Goldstein also demonstrated the faster the cytoplasmic flow along these trajectories, the larger the concentration gradient that arises, and the larger diffusive nutrient transport into the storage vacuole that occurs. The enhanced nutrient transport into the vacuole leads to striking differences in growth rate and overall growth size. 

Experiments have been performed in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. Wild type versions of this plant exhibit cytoplasmic streaming due to the entrainment of fluid similar to &quot;Chara coralina&quot;, only at slower flow rates. One experiment removes the wild type myosin motor molecule from the plant and replaces it with a faster myosin molecule which moves along the actin filaments at 16 microns/sec. In another set of plants, the myosin molecule is replaced with the slower homo sapiens Vb myosin motor molecule. Human myosin Vb only moves at a rate of .19 microns/sec. Resulting cytoplasmic flows rates are 4.3 microns/sec for the wild type and 7.5 microns/sec for the plants implanted with the rapidly moving myosin protein. 

The plants implanted with human myosin Vb do not exhibit continuous cytoplasmic streaming. The plants are then allowed to grow under similar conditions. Faster cytoplasmic rates produced larger plants with larger and more abundant leaves. This suggests that the enhanced nutrient storage demonstrated by the Goldstein model allows for plants to grow larger and faster.

=== Increased photosynthetic activity ===

Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This occurs in the chloroplasts of plants cells. Light photons interact with various intermembrane proteins of the cholorplast to accomplish this. However, these proteins can become saturated with photons, making them unable to function until the saturation is alleviated. This is known as the Kautsky effect and is a cause of inefficiency on the ATP production mechanism. Cytoplasmic streaming in &quot;Chara corallina&quot;, however, enables chloroplasts to move around the stem of the plant. Thus, the chloroplasts move into lighted regions and shaded regions. This intermittent exposure to photons due to cytoplasmic streaming actually increases the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. Photosynthetic activity is generally assessed using chlorophyll fluorescence analysis.

=== Gravisensing ===

Gravisensing is the ability to sense the gravitational force and react to it. Many plants use gravisensing to direct growth. For example, depending on root orientation, amyloplasts will settle within a plant cell differently. These different settling patterns cause the protein auxin to be distributed differently within the plant. This differences in the distribution pattern direct roots to grow downward or outward. 

In most plants, gravisensing requires a coordinated multi-cellular effort, but in &quot;Chara corallina&quot;, one cell detects gravity and responds to it. The barber pole chloroplast motion resulting from cytoplasmic streaming has one flow upward and another downward. The downward motion of the chloroplasts moves a bit faster than the upward flow producing a ratio of speeds of 1.1. This ratio is known as the polar ratio and depends on the force of gravity. This increase in speed is not a direct result of the force of gravity, but an indirect result. Gravity causes the plant protoplast to settle within the cell wall. Thus, the cell membrane is put into tension at the top, and into compression at the bottom. The resulting pressures on the membrane allow for gravisensing which result in the differing speeds of cytoplasmic flow observed in &quot;Chara coralina&quot;. This gravitational theory of gravisensing is directly opposed to the statolith theory exhibited by the settling of amyloplasts.

=== Natural emergence ===
Cytoplasmic streaming occurs due to the motion of organelles attached to actin filaments via myosin motor proteins. However, in &quot;Chara corallina&quot;, the organization of actin filaments is highly ordered. Actin is a polar molecule, which means that myosin only moves in one direction along the actin filament. Thus, in &quot;Chara corallina&quot;, where motion of the chloroplasts and the myosin molecule follow a barber pole pattern, the actin filaments must all be similarly oriented within each section. In other words, the section where the chloroplasts move upward will have all of the actin filaments oriented in the same upward direction, and the section where the chloroplasts move downward will have all the actin filaments oriented in the downward direction. 

This organization emerges naturally from basic principles. With basic, realistic assumptions about the actin filament, Woodhouse demonstrated that the formation of two sets of actin filament orientations in a cylindrical cell is likely. His assumptions included a force keeping the actin filament in place once set down, an attractive force between filaments leading them to be more likely align as a filament already in place, and a repulsive force preventing alignment perpendicular to the length of the cylindrical cell. 

The first two assumptions derive from the molecular forces within the actin filament, while the last assumption was made due to the actin molecule&#x27;s dislike of curvature. Computer simulations run with these assumptions with varying parameters for the assumptive forces almost always leads to highly ordered actin organizations. However, no order was as organized and consistent as the barber pole pattern found in nature, which suggests this mechanism plays role, but is not wholly responsible for the organization of actin filaments in &quot;Chara corallina&quot;.

== Created by pressure gradients==
Cytoplasmic streaming in some species is caused by pressure gradients along the length of the cell.

===In &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot;===
&quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; is a single-celled protist, belonging to a group of organisms informally referred to as &#x27;slime molds&#x27;. Biological investigations into the myosin and actin molecules in this amoeboid have demonstrated striking physical and mechanistic similarities to human muscle myosin and actin molecules. Contraction and relaxation of these molecules leads to pressure gradients along the length of the cell. These contractions force cytoplasmic fluid in one direction and contributes to growth. It has been demonstrated that while the molecules are similar to those in humans, the molecule blocking the binding site of myosin to actin is different. While, in humans, tropomyosin covers the site, only allowing contraction when calcium ions are present, in this amoeboid, a different molecule known as calmodulin blocks the site, allowing relaxation in the presence of high calcium ion levels.

===In &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;===
&quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; is a multicellular fungus with many off shooting hyphae. Cells can be up to 10 cm long, and are separated by a small septum. Small holes in the septum allow cytoplasm and cytoplasmic contents to flow from cell to cell. Osmotic pressure gradients occur through the length of the cell to drive this cytoplasmic flow. Flows contribute to growth and the formation of cellular subcompartments.

====Contribution to growth====
Cytoplasmic flows created through osmotic pressure gradients flow longitudinally along the fungal hyphae and crash into the end causing growth. It has been demonstrated that the greater pressure at the hyphal tip corresponds to faster growth rates. Longer hyphae have greater pressure differences along their length allowing for faster cytoplasmic flow rates and larger pressures at the hyphal tip. This is why longer hyphae grow faster than shorter ones. Tip growth increases as cytoplasmic flow rate increases over a 24-hour period until a max rate of 1 micron/second growth rate is observed. Offshoots from the main hyphae are shorter and have slower cytoplasmic flow rates and correspondingly slower growth rates.

====Formation of cellular subcompartments====
Cytoplasmic flow in &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; carry microtubules. The presence of microtubules create interesting aspects to the flow. Modelling the fungal cells as a pipe separated at regular points with a septum with a hole in the center should produce very symmetrical flow. Basic fluid mechanics suggest that eddies should form both before and after each septum. However, eddies only form before the septum in &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;. This is because when microtubules enter the septal hole, they are arranged parallel to flow and contribute very little to flow characteristics, however, as the exit the septal hole, the orient themselves perpendicular to flow, slowing acceleration, and preventing eddy formation. The eddies formed just before the septum allow for the formation of subcompartments where nuclei spotted with special proteins aggregate. These proteins, one of which is called SPA-19, contribute to septum maintenance. Without it, the septum would degrade and the cell would leak large amounts of cytoplasm into the neighboring cell leading to cell death.

==In mouse oocytes==
In many animal cells, centrioles and spindles keep nuclei centered within a cell for mitotic, meiotic, and other processes. Without such a centering mechanism, disease and death can result. While mouse oocytes do have centrioles, they play no role in nucleus positioning, yet, the nucleus of the oocyte maintains a central position. This is a result of cytoplasmic streaming. 

Microfilaments, independent of microtubules and myosin 2, form a mesh network throughout the cell. Nuclei, positioned in non-centered cell locations, have been demonstrated to migrate distances greater than 25 microns to the cell center. They will do this without going off course by more than 6 microns when the network is present. This network of microfilaments has organelles bound to it by the myosin Vb molecule. Cytoplasmic fluid is entrained by the motion of these organelles, however, no pattern of directionality is associated with the movement of the cytoplasm. In fact, the motion has been demonstrated to fulfill Brownian motion characteristics. For this reason, there is some debate as to whether this should be called cytoplasmic streaming. 

Nonetheless, directional movement of organelles does result from this situation. Since the cytoplasm fills the cell, it is geometrically arranged into the shape of a sphere. As the radius of a sphere increases, surface area increases. Further, the motion in any given direction is proportional to the surface area. So thinking of the cell as a series of concentric spheres, it is clear that spheres with larger radii produce a greater amount of movement than spheres with smaller radii. Thus, the movement toward the center is greater than the movement away from the center, and net movement pushing the nucleus towards a central cellular location exists. In other words, the random motion of the cytoplasmic particles create a net force toward the center of the cell. 

Additionally, the increased motion with the cytoplasm reduces cytoplasmic viscosity allowing the nucleus to move more easily within the cell. These two factors of the cytoplasmic streaming center the nucleus in the oocyte cell.

<text>Sept-Rivières (, &quot;Seven-Rivers&quot;) is a regional county municipality of Quebec, Canada, in the Côte-Nord region. Its county seat is Sept-Îles.

The census groups Sept-Rivières RCM with neighbouring Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality into the single census division of Sept-Rivières—Caniapiscau. In the 2021 Canadian census, the combined population was 38,240. The population of Sept-Rivières RCM itself was 34,358, of whom the vast majority live in the city of Sept-Îles.

==Geography==
Sept-Rivières is located in the central part of Côte-Nord. It is bordered by the regional county municipalities of Manicouagan, Caniapiscau, and Minganie, as well as by the southwest corner of Labrador and by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is mostly covered by the Laurentian Mountains. It is a very sparsely populated and undeveloped region with its population highly concentrated along the coast, mostly at Sept-Îles (about three-fourths of the population).

It allegedly takes its name from seven major rivers that join the Saint Lawrence within the territory: Moisie, Sainte-Marguerite, Trinité, Pentecôte, aux Rochers, Pigou and Manitou. But neither the Trinité River nor the Manitou River reaches the Saint Lawrence within the limits of the regional county municipality, and many other rivers could be amongst those &quot;seven rivers&quot;.

==Subdivisions==
There are four subdivisions and two native reserves within the RCM:

;Cities &amp; Towns (2)
* Port-Cartier
* Sept-Îles

;Unorganized territories (2)
* Lac-Walker
* Rivière-Nipissis

;Native Reserves (2)(not associated with RCM)
* Maliotenam
* Uashat
==Demographics==


==Transportation==
===Access Routes===
Highways and numbered routes that run through the municipality, including external routes that start or finish at the county border:

* Autoroutes
** None

* Principal Highways

* Secondary Highways
** None

* External Routes
** None
==River basins==
There are a number of large rivers that flow in a generally north-south direction through Sept-Rivières to enter the Gulf. Near the coast the river basins tend to narrow in towards the river mouth, and between their mouths are areas that drain into the Gulf through smaller streams. From west to east, the larger river basins, which may cover parts of neighboring regions, are:

<text>LisaGay Hamilton (born 1964) is an American actress who has portrayed roles in films, television, and on stage. She is best known for her role as secretary/lawyer Rebecca Washington on the ABC legal drama &quot;The Practice&quot; (1997–2003). She also portrayed Melissa Thoreau on the TNT comedy-drama &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot; (2009–2011), Celia Jones on the Netflix series &quot;House of Cards&quot; (2016), Suzanne Simms on the Hulu series &quot;Chance&quot; (2016), and Kayla Price in &quot;The First&quot; (2018), also by Hulu.

Hamilton&#x27;s film credits include roles in &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997), &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998), &quot;True Crime&quot; (1999), &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (2002), &quot;The Soloist&quot; (2009), &quot;Beastly&quot; (2011), &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; (2018), and &quot;Vice&quot; (2018). Her theater credits include &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (Isabella), &quot;Henry IV Parts I &amp; II&quot; (Lady Hotspur), Athol Fugard&#x27;s, &quot;Valley Song&quot; and &quot;The Ohio State Murders&quot;. Hamilton was also an original cast member in the Broadway productions of August Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; and &quot;Gem of the Ocean&quot;. In 2005 she won a Peabody Award for creating and directing the 2003 documentary film &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Los Angeles, California but spent most of her childhood in Stony Brook, New York on the north shore of Long Island. Her father, Ira Winslow Hamilton, Jr., hailed from Bessemer, Alabama, and her mother, the former Eleanor Albertine &quot;Tina&quot; Blackwell, was from Meridian, Mississippi. Both parents graduated from historically black colleges—Tina attended Talladega while Ira went to Morehouse—and they both became successful professionals. Ira worked for a while as an engineer and then went into business as a general contractor. Tina eventually earned a master&#x27;s degree in social work and worked for the Girl Scouts for many years.

Hamilton fell in love with theater at an early age. During the 1970s, she saw several off-Broadway productions by the Negro Ensemble Company, including &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; and &quot;The First Breeze of Summer&quot;. She enrolled in Carnegie Mellon University to study theater, but after a year was accepted into New York University&#x27;s Tisch Drama School where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater in 1985. She then pursued graduate studies at The Juilliard School where she earned a M.A. in drama in 1989.

==Career==
Early on, Hamilton set her sights on classical theater. In one of her first notable roles, she played opposite Kevin Kline in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; in the New York Shakespeare Festival. Hamilton&#x27;s performances in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing, Tartuffe, Reckless, Family of Mann&quot;, and &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, earned her a reputation as a serious dramatic actor. In 1995–96, her portrayal of a young, aspiring South African singer in Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;Valley Song&quot; garnered an Obie Award, the Clarence Derwent Award, the Ovation nomination for best actress, and a Drama Desk nomination. More recently, Hamilton earned critical acclaim, her second Obie, and a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for her role as Suzanne Alexander in Adrienne Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;The Ohio State Murders&quot;.

Hamilton appeared in over two dozen films, including &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot; and &quot;Beloved&quot; for director Jonathan Demme, Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;True Crime&quot;, the independent films; &quot;Palookaville&quot;, &quot;Drunks&quot;, Showtime&#x27;s &quot;A House Divided&quot;, and as Ophelia in director Campbell Scott&#x27;s film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. She has worked on several projects with director Rodrigo García, notably his films &quot;Ten Tiny Love Stories&quot;, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, and &quot;Mother and Child&quot;. &quot;Honeydripper&quot; directed by John Sayles and &quot;The Soloist&quot;, directed by Joe Wright.

Hamilton won a Peabody Award in 2005 for creating and directing the 2003 documentary film &quot;&quot;. The film tells the story of pioneering black actress Beah Richards, who had broken ground for African-American actresses. The two women had met on the set of &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998). Over the next two years, Hamilton made a record of more than 70 hours of their conversations. Hamilton&#x27;s film explored Richards&#x27; political activism as well as her poetry. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the AFI Film Festival. After Richards died in 2000, Hamilton collaborated with illustrator R. Gregory Christie to turn one of her poems into a children&#x27;s book. &quot;Keep Climbing Girls&quot; was published by Simon and Schuster in 2006.

Hamilton played the role of Melissa in &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot;, an hour-long comedy-drama television series starring Ray Romano, Andre Braugher, and Scott Bakula that ran from 2009 to 2011.

In the fall of 2010, Hamilton took a faculty position at the School of Theater for the California Institute of the Arts, where she teaches in the Acting Program.

<text>Diethylhydroxylamine (DEHA) is an organic compound with the formula (C2H5)2NOH. Strictly, this is &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diethylhydroxylamine. It has an isomer, &quot;N&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-diethylhydroxylamine with the formula EtNHOEt. Pure &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diethylhydroxylamine is a colorless liquid, although it is usually encountered as a colourless-to-yellow solution in water with an amine-like odor. 

DEHA can be synthesised from a reaction between triethylamine and a peroxide. 

==Applications==
DEHA is largely used as an oxygen scavenger in water treatment.

It is a volatile oxygen scavenger and reacts in a ratio of 2.8/1 DEHA/O. It is employed in high pressure (&gt;70 bar) boiler systems due to a very low rate of reaction at low temperatures and pressures. Due to its volatility, it acts as an oxygen scavenger throughout the entire boiler system due to steam carryover. 

DEHA also reacts with ferrous metals to form a passivized film of magnetite throughout the boiler system. The reduction of toxic heavy metals, such as hexavalent chromium to their more environmentally-friendly counterparts like trivalent chromium, is also performed using aqueous solutions containing DEHA.

Several other applications include its use as:
#Polymerisation inhibitor
#Color stabilizer (photographics)
#Corrosion inhibitor
#Discoloration inhibitor (phenolics)
#Antiozonant
#Radical scavenger

<doc id="656652" wikidata="Q2570501" url="?curid=656652" title="MI9">
<text>MI9, the British Directorate of Military Intelligence Section 9, was a secret department of the War Office between 1939 and 1945. During World War II it had two principal tasks: assisting in the escape of Allied prisoners of war (POWs) held by the Axis countries, especially Nazi Germany; and helping Allied military personnel, especially downed airmen, evade capture after they were shot down or trapped behind enemy lines in Axis-occupied countries. During World War II, about 35,000 Allied military personnel, many helped by MI9, escaped POW camps or evaded capture and made their way to Allied or neutral countries after being trapped behind enemy lines.

The best-known activity of MI9 was creating and supporting escape and evasion lines, especially in France and Belgium, which helped 5,000 downed British, American and other Allied airmen evade capture and return to duty. The usual routes of escape from occupied Europe were either south to Switzerland or to southern France and then over the Pyrenees to neutral Spain and Portugal. MI9 trained Allied soldiers and airmen in tactics for evading and escaping and helped prisoners of war to escape by establishing clandestine communications and providing escape devices to them.

== Origin ==

MI9 officially came into being on 23 December 1939, led by Major (later Brigadier) Norman Crockatt, formerly of The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment). In December 1941, a sub-section of MI9 became a separate department, MI19. At first MI9 was located in Room 424 of the Metropole Hotel, Northumberland Avenue, London. With limited space at the Metropole, a floor was also taken at the requisitioned Great Central Hotel, opposite Marylebone station, where World War II prison-camp escapees were debriefed and questioned about their journey home. After a German bomb caused slight damage to the Metropole Hotel in September 1940, Crockatt moved MI9 to a large country house, Wilton Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.

MI9 initially received little financial support and was understaffed due to power struggles and personality clashes with MI6, the &quot;oldest and grandest&quot; of the British secret services. The assistant-head of MI6 was Claude Dansey, known as ACSS. Dansey maintained on behalf of MI6 considerable control over MI9, especially not wishing the upstart secret services such as MI9, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), and the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) to compete or interfere with the intelligence gathering function of MI6.

Two posthumously well-known sections of MI9 are Intelligence School 9, section d, known as IS9(d) or &quot;Room 900,&quot; and &quot;Q.&quot; Room 900 was staffed by James Langley and Airey Neave (code named &quot;Saturday&quot;) who joined MI9 in 1941 and 1942 respectively. Both were soldiers who had escaped from German captivity. Langley and Neave were concerned with creating and supporting escape and evasion lines in Europe. &quot;Q,&quot; staffed by Christopher Hutton and Charles Fraser-Smith, was charged with inventing devices to aid soldiers to evade or escape capture. &quot;Q&quot; was made famous in fiction by the James Bond movies.

==Escape lines==

Escape lines for Allied soldiers and airmen stranded behind enemy lines were created after the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940. Most of the British soldiers left behind were captured or surrendered, but about 1,000 soldiers stranded in France declined to surrender, evaded capture by the Germans, and eventually made their way back to Britain with the help of escape lines. Initially, escape lines were created and financed by the citizenry of France and Belgium who opposed the German occupation of their countries.

Many of the stranded soldiers made their way to Marseilles in Vichy France, theoretically independent but a puppet state of Nazi Germany. Residents of Marseille created the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line to help the British soldiers in Marseilles escape to neutral Spain, either by boat or by crossing the Pyrenees on foot. In July 1940, MI9 sent a young man named Donald Darling (code named &quot;Sunday&quot;) to Spain and Portugal to help the fledging Pat line exfiltrate soldiers from France to Spain. In Nazi-occupied Belgium, Belgians created the Comet Line. MI9 became aware of Comet in September 1941 when a young woman, Andrée de Jongh, appeared unknown and unannounced at the British Consulate in Bilbao with a British soldier in tow who she had guided through German-occupied France all the way from Belgium. She promised to bring more soldiers if MI9 paid the Comet Line&#x27;s expenses. A British diplomat, Michael Creswell (code named &quot;Monday&quot;), became the chief contact of the Comet Line in Spain. 
Darling headed MI9 operations in Portugal and later in Gibraltar.

Working for the escape lines was arguably the most dangerous resistance activity in Europe and about one-half of the &quot;helpers&quot; (as they were called) were women, mostly young, who could travel with less difficulty and were less suspicious to the Germans than men. The Comet line initially rejected all MI9 assistance and advice except reimbursement for expenses ($200 to $300 in 1942 U.S. dollars for each airman or soldier delivered to Spain). The Pat Line also received financial assistance from MI9 and beginning in April 1942 accepted wireless operators sent to France by MI9 to improve communications between Marseilles and MI9 headquarters.

As Allied bombing of occupied Europe increased in 1942, the emphasis of the escape lines turned to rescuing and exfiltrating airmen who had been shot down or crashed in Nazi-controlled territory. The Germans succeeded in mostly destroying the Pat line and weakening the Comet line and additional lines were created, sometimes at the initiative of MI9. MI9 created the Shelburne Escape Line which exfiltrated downed airmen by boat from the coast of Brittany to England and in Operation Marathon set up a secret camp to shelter downed airmen in a remote forest until they could be rescued by Allied forces after the successful Normandy invasion of France.

== Middle East ==
In late 1940, Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) Dudley Clarke arrived in Cairo at the request of Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, General Sir Archibald Wavell. Clarke&#x27;s main role was to manage military deception in the region. As cover for this secret mission, he was also assigned the job of managing MI9&#x27;s presence in the Middle East. After Clarke set up his &#x27;A&#x27; Force deception department this cover was extended to the entire office; and for a while &#x27;A&#x27; Force represented MI9 in the region until later in the war when the two became separate once again.

== Escape aids ==

MI9 manufactured various escape aids that they sent to prisoner-of-war camps. Many of them were based on the ideas of Christopher Hutton. Hutton proved so popular that he built himself a secret underground bunker in the middle of a field where he could work in peace.

Hutton made compasses that were hidden inside pens or tunic buttons. He used left-hand threads so that, if the Germans discovered them and the searcher tried to screw them open, they would just tighten. He printed maps on silk, so they would not rustle, and disguised them as handkerchiefs, hiding them inside canned goods. For aircrew he designed special boots with detachable leggings that could quickly be converted to look like civilian shoes, and hollow heels that contained packets of dried food. A magnetised razor blade would indicate north if placed on water. Some of the spare uniforms that were sent to prisoners could be easily converted into civilian suits. Officer prisoners inside Colditz Castle requested and received a complete floor plan of the castle.

Hutton also designed an escaper&#x27;s knife: a strong blade, a screwdriver, three saws, a lockpick, a forcing tool and a wire cutter.

MI9 used the services of former magician Jasper Maskelyne to design hiding places for escape aids including tools hidden in cricket bats and baseball bats, maps concealed in playing cards and actual money in board-games. Notably were maps hidden in Monopoly boards, and real money hidden in the piles of Monopoly money.

Forged German identity cards, ration coupons and travel warrants were also smuggled into POW camps by MI9.

MI9 sent the tools in parcels in the name of various, usually nonexistent, charity organizations. They did not use Red Cross parcels lest they violate the Geneva Convention and to avoid the guards restricting access to them. MI9 relied upon their parcels either not being searched by the Germans or ensuring that the prisoners (warned by a secret message) could remove the contraband before they were searched. In time the German guards learned to expect and find the escape aids.

The British games manufacturer Jaques of London were commissioned by MI9 to produce a variety of games (from board games to sports) which contained numerous escape and evasion devices. These included travel and full sized chess sets, with contraband inside the wooden boards, the boxes or the chess pieces themselves, table tennis, tennis, badminton racquets containing money, maps and miniature compasses, dart boards filled with escape devices and tools, shove halfpenny boards, hollowed and filled with escape aids, and larger boxed games containing even more contraband. It was not until X-Ray machines were deployed at German POW camps, that the German authorities began to capture significant amounts of escape material.

In southern China the MI9 unit British Army Aid Group helped POWs in Japanese camps escape to China during World War II. The group was closely linked to the Hong Kong Chinese Regiment.

<text>Témiscamingue () is a regional county municipality in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of western Quebec, Canada. The county seat is Ville-Marie.

Though Témiscamingue borders Pontiac Regional County Municipality to the south, it is not practical to travel between the two within Quebec without taking a major detour north towards Quebec Route 117. The shorter route is to cross into Ontario at Notre-Dame-du-Nord or Témiscaming and travel south on Highway 11, then east on Highway 17, before crossing back at L&#x27;Isle-aux-Allumettes.

<text>Jessica Brooke Capshaw (born August 9, 1976) is an American actress known for her roles as Jamie Stringer on the ABC legal drama series &quot;The Practice&quot;, and as Dr. Arizona Robbins on the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

==Early life==
Capshaw was born in Columbia, Missouri. She is the stepdaughter of director Steven Spielberg, whom her mother, Kate Capshaw married when Capshaw was 15.

Capshaw graduated from Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles in 1994, then attended Brown University, where she was in productions of &quot;Arcadia&quot; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. She graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts in English literature. During summers, she attended classes at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in London, where she appeared as Puck in a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Career==
Capshaw had a minor role as Jeremy Davies&#x27; potential love interest in &quot;The Locusts&quot; (1997), which starred her mother, then appeared in Adam Rifkin&#x27;s independent film &quot;Denial&quot; (1998). She played Dorothy Wheeler in the slasher film &quot;Valentine&quot; (2001), had a minor role in &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), then a lead role in Edward Burns&#x27;s &quot;The Groomsmen&quot; (2006).

In 2009, Capshaw became a regular on the medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. It was announced in December 2008 that she would join the cast as pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins for a multi-episode arc. Initially scheduled to appear in only three episodes of the show&#x27;s fifth season, series creator Shonda Rhimes extended her contract to appear in all of the season&#x27;s remaining episodes, and she became a series regular in the sixth season.

Capshaw was established as a love interest for orthopedic surgery resident Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). Rhimes was pleased with the chemistry between them, saying that the addition of Capshaw to the cast was an element of the season of which she was most proud: &quot;I love Jessica Capshaw, and when I say love I mean love. She couldn&#x27;t be a more wonderful person, and I feel like the chemistry Arizona and Callie have feels like the Meredith and Derek chemistry to me. I find them delightful to watch.&quot; Initial media reaction was positive. Matt Mitovich of &quot;TV Guide&quot; called Capshaw a &quot;fan favorite&quot;, and Chris Monfette of IGN praised the addition of &quot;fresh, new characters&quot; such as Robbins over the course of the season.

In March 2018, Capshaw left &quot;Grey’s Anatomy&quot;, with the producers citing creative reasons. She posted a statement on Twitter highlighting her character&#x27;s significance: &quot;She was one of the first members of the LGBTQ community to be represented in a series regular role on network television. Her impact on the world is permanent and forever.&quot;

==Personal life==
Capshaw is married to Christopher Gavigan. They wed in 2004 and have four children.

<doc id="656671" wikidata="Q40758" url="?curid=656671" title="Mount Damavand">
<text>Mount Damavand ( ) is a dormant stratovolcano and is the highest peak in Iran and Western Asia, the highest volcano in Asia, and the 3rd highest volcano in the Eastern Hemisphere (after Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Elbrus), at an elevation of . Damāvand has a special place in Persian mythology and folklore. It is in the middle of the Alborz range, adjacent to &quot;Varārū&quot;, &quot;Sesang&quot;, &quot;Gol-e Zard&quot;, and &quot;Mīānrūd&quot;. It is near the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, in Amol City, Mazandaran State, northeast of the city of Tehran.


Mount Damāvand is the 12th most prominent peak in the world and is part of the Volcanic Seven Summits mountaineering challenge.

==Symbolism and mythology==
Damavand is a significant mountain in Persian mythology. It is the symbol of Iranian resistance against despotism and foreign rule in Persian poetry and literature. In Zoroastrian texts and mythology, the three-headed dragon Aži Dahāka was chained within Mount Damāvand, there to remain until the end of the world. In a later version of the same legend, the tyrant Zahhāk was also chained in a cave somewhere in Mount Damāvand after being defeated by Kāveh and Fereydūn. Persian poet Ferdowsi depicts this event in his masterpiece, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;:


&quot;biyāvard Zahhāk rā čon navandbe kuh-e Damāvand kardaš be-band&quot;

 He brought Zahhak like a horse to Mount Damavand,And tied him at the peak tight and bound.

The mountain is said to hold magical powers in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. Damāvand has also been named in the Iranian legend of Arash (as recounted by Bal&#x27;ami) as the location from which the hero shot his magical arrow to mark the border of Iran, during the border dispute between Iran and Turan. The poem Damāvand by Mohammad Taqī Bahār is also one fine example of the mountain&#x27;s significance in Persian literature. The first verse of this poem reads:


&quot;ey div-e sepid-e pāy-dar-band,ey gonbad-e giti, ey Damāvand&quot;

 O white giant with feet in chains,O dome of the world, O Damāvand.

Mount Damavand is depicted on the reverse of the Iranian 10,000 rial banknote.

The origins and meaning of the word &quot;Damavand&quot; are unclear, yet some prominent researchers have speculated that it probably means &quot;The mountain from which smoke and ash arises&quot;, alluding to the volcanic nature of the mountain.

==Geology==
===Setting and structure===
Mount Damavand rises within the Alborz range in northern Iran, separating the Iranian plateau to the south from the Caspian Sea in the north. This range rises as a result of the collision between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision is similar to the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates to the east, which is causing the Himalaya to rise and does not usually create volcanic activity. Despite this, recent research suggests that a hot region created by the collision is what caused the volcano to rise.

Seismic wave patterns from earthquakes around the volcano indicate that a magma chamber is present between below the surface. This is separated into two areas - an inner region of hot, likely molten, magma between depth that is surrounded by an area of dense cooled magma. The top of the chamber is believed to lie to the south of the summit, trending somewhat to the west with depth.

Most volcanic activity originates from the summit area. A few flank vents have been noted, but these are largely on the upper slopes to the southwest and northeast of the summit. A secondary crater, termed Haji Dela, has some young lava flows northeast of the summit.

===Eruptive activity===
Volcanic activity in the Mount Damavand region first occurred in the Pleistocene almost 1.78 million years ago, but the current edifice began to be built around 600,000 years ago.

Its last eruption was around 5300 BCE in the Holocene. Its steep cone is formed of ash and lava flows mainly of trachyte, andesite, and basalt. Most eruptive activity appears to be lava flows, though some small pyroclastic flow deposits have been noted in drainages radiating from the mountain. One major explosive event is known to have erupted about 280,000 years ago.

Quaternary lavas are directly on the Jurassic sediments. The volcano is crowned by a small crater with sulfuric deposits. Despite the lack of historical eruptions, ongoing thermal activity at Mount Damavand suggests the volcano is not extinct. Subsidence at a rate of per year and horizontal expansion at per year was observed there between 2003 and 2008, but was gravity driven rather than a result of magmatic activity.

===Thermal springs===

Mineral hot springs are mainly located on the volcano&#x27;s flanks and at the base, giving evidence of volcanic heat comparatively near the surface of the earth. Hot springs at the base and on the flanks and fumaroles near the summit indicate a hot or cooling magma body still present beneath the volcano. The area around the volcano is the most thermally active in Iran and the springs are being monitored to see if fluctuations in water volume and mineral content are useful in crude prediction of large regional earthquakes.

The most important of these hot springs is Larijan Hot Spring in a village by the name of Larijan in the district of Larijan Amol in Lar Valley. The water from this spring is believed to be useful in the treatment of chronic wounds and skin diseases and is bottled for distribution throughout Iran. Near these springs there are public baths with small pools for public use.

===Glaciers===
A few glaciers are present on the upper slopes of Damavand, the largest of which is Yakhar Glacier. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the area covered by glaciation was much larger and the climatic snow line was between below what is seen in the present day. The glaciers on Damavand as well as a few other isolated locations are the source of the few permanently flowing rivers in Iran.

== Routes to the summit ==
A major settlement for mountain climbers is the new Iranian Mountain Federation Camp in the village of Polour, located on the southern side of the mountain.

There are at least 16 known routes to the summit, with varying levels of difficulty. Some of them are dangerous and require ice climbing. The most popular route is the southern route which has steps and a camp midway called Bargah Sevom Camp/Shelter at . The Northeastern route is the longest and requires two days to reach the summit starting from the downhill village of Nāndal and a night stay at Takht-e Fereydoun (elevation , a two-story shelter. The western route is noted for its sunset view. Simurgh (Sīmorgh/Sīmurgh) shelter in this route at is a newly constructed two-story shelter. There is a frozen waterfall/icefall (Persian name Ābshār Yakhī) about tall.

==Geographical location==

==Wildlife==

=== Fish ===
Damavand rivers and slopes are famous for brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;).

===Mammals===
Armenian mouflon (&quot;Ovis orientalis&quot;) and wild goat (&quot;Capra aegagrus&quot;) live in the region of Damavand Mts. Persian leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus saxicolor&quot;) and Syrian brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos syriacus&quot;) also inhabit in this region. Smaller mammals include the snow vole (&quot;Chionomys nivalis&quot;), mouse-like hamster (&quot;Calomyscus bailwardi&quot;) and Afghan pika (&quot;Ochoton rufescens&quot;).

===Birds===
The attractive and unreachable Caspian snowcock (&quot;Tetraogallus caspius&quot;) lives at high altitudes. Golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) breeds in this area. Griffon vultures (&quot;Gyps fulvus&quot;) are common. Chukar partridge (&quot;Alectoris chukar&quot;) has a high population and nests between stone and shrubs. Red-fronted serin (&quot;Serinus pusillus&quot;), linnet (&quot;Carduelis cannabina&quot;), snow finch (&quot;Montifringilla nivalis&quot;), rock sparrow (&quot;Petronia petronia&quot;), rock bunting (&quot;Emberiza cia&quot;) and horned lark (&quot;Eremophila alpestris&quot;) are native; in winter they come to the lower hillsides. In spring northern wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;), rock thrush (&quot;Monticola saxatilis&quot;), and nightingale (&quot;Luscinia megarhynchos&quot;) come from Africa for breeding. Grey-necked bunting (&quot;Emberiza buchanani&quot;), black-headed bunting (&quot;Emberiza melanocephala&quot;) and common rosefinch (&quot;Carpodacus erythrinus&quot;) come from India.

===Reptiles and amphibians===
Marsh frogs (&quot;Rana ridibunda&quot;) live in Lar riversides. Meadow viper (&quot;Vipera ursinii&quot;), blunt-nosed viper (&quot;Macrovipera lebetina&quot;), Iranian valley viper (&quot;Vipera latifii&quot;) and Caucasian agama (&quot;Laudakia caucasia&quot;) are among the reptiles of this mountainous region.

===Flora===
On the southern slope of Damavand, there are remnants of wild pistachia trees (&quot;Pistacia atlantica&quot;). Along its riversides different kinds of &quot;Salix&quot; trees like willow (&quot;Salix acomphylla&quot;) and oleaster (&quot;Elaeagnus angustifolia&quot;) are found. Greek juniper (&quot;Juniperus excelsa&quot;) is common in the higher altitudes. On northern slopes, because of higher humidity, there are wild oak, beech, hornbean and hazel trees like: Persian oak (&quot;Quercus macranthera&quot;), Oriental beech (&quot;Fagus orientalis&quot;), Eastern hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus orientalis&quot;), and Turkish hazel (&quot;Corylus colurna&quot;). There are also many wild flowers such as mountain tulip (&quot;Tulipa montana&quot;) and Persian stone cress (&quot;Aethionema grandiflorum&quot;). At higher altitudes, shrubs tend to be sphere and cushion like, examples are : &quot;Astragalus&quot; species (&quot;Astragalus microcephalus&quot;), mountain sainfoin (&quot;Onobrychis cornuta&quot;) and prickly (&quot;Acantholimon erinaceum&quot;). Different kinds of grasses complete this alpine scene.
&quot;Iris barnumiae demawendica&quot; (formerly &quot;Iris demawendica&quot;), is found and named after the mountain.

== National Heritage Site ==
An anthropologist of Mazandaran Cultural Heritage and Tourism Department, Touba Osanlou, has said that a proposal has been made by a group of Iranian mountaineers to register the highest peak in the Middle East, Mount Damavand as a national heritage site.
Mazandaran Cultural Heritage and Tourism Department has accepted the proposal, the Persian daily Jam-e Jam reported. Osanlou noted that the Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization is presently in the process of renaming an upcoming ancient festivity after Mount Damavand. &quot;We have proposed Tirgan Festivity, Tabari Nowruz, to be named as Damavand National Day,&quot; she added. Tirgan Festivity is held in Amol County&#x27;s Rineh region in Mazandaran province.

<text>Daniel Giraud Elliot (March 7, 1835 – December 22, 1915) was an American zoologist and the founder of the American Ornithologist Union.

==Life==
He was born in New York City on March 7, 1835, to George and Rebecca Elliot. In 1858, he married Ann Eliza Henderson.

From 1869 to 1879, he was in London and established strong links to British ornithologists and naturalists.

Elliot used his wealth to publish a series of sumptuous color-plate books on birds and other animals. Elliot wrote the text himself and commissioned artists such as Joseph Wolf and Joseph Smit, both of whom had worked for John Gould, to provide the illustrations. The books included &quot;A Monograph of the Phasianidae (Family of the Pheasants)&quot; (1870–72), &quot;A Monograph of the Paradiseidae or Birds of Paradise&quot; (1873), &quot;A Monograph of the Felidae or Family of Cats&quot; (1878) and &quot;Review of the Primates&quot; (1913).

In 1890, he was President of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union. Elliot became the first curator of zoology at the Field Museum in Chicago, and in 1896, accompanied by Carl Akeley, led the museum&#x27;s expedition to Somaliland, the first African zoological collecting expedition to be mounted by a North American museum.

In 1899, Elliot was invited to join the elite Harriman Alaska Expedition to study and document wildlife along the Alaskan coast.

Elliot was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union and of the Société zoologique de France.

==Death==
He died in New York City on December 22, 1915, of pneumonia.

==Legacy==
The National Academy of Sciences awards the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal &quot;for meritorious work in zoology or paleontology published in a three- to five-year period. Established through the Daniel Giraud Elliot Fund by gift of Miss Margaret Henderson Elliot.&quot;

<doc id="656681" wikidata="Q1517624" url="?curid=656681" title="Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality">
<text>Vaudreuil-Soulanges () is a regional county municipality in Quebec, Canada. It is located on a triangular peninsula in the western Montérégie region of Quebec, formed by the confluence of the Ottawa River to the north, and the St. Lawrence River to the south. Ontario is located west of here.

==Geography==
Vaudreuil-Soulanges is part of the St Lawrence Valley. Two million years ago the region was subject to a series of glaciations that covered much of North America. The last in the series was the Wisconsin glaciation. The ice sheet weighed down the landscape. This created the depressions in the land that created the basins for Lake Saint-Louis, Lac des Deux-Montagnes and Lake Saint-Francis. As the ice sheet eroded, the region was mostly submerged 12,000 years ago by an inland saltwater sea known as the Champlain sea. Once the glacier was melted, the land rose again, pushing the saltwater into the sea. 10,000 years ago the body of water, now a fresh water lake, has been named by scholars as Lake Lampsilis.

==History==
During the French colonial period, the region of New France was divided into several seigneuries populated by French colonists.

* Seigneurie de L&#x27;Île-Perrot founded on October 29, 1672 (modern day L&#x27;Île-Perrot, Pincourt, Notre-Dame-de-L&#x27;Île-Perrot and Terrasse-Vaudreuil)
* Seigneurie de Vaudreuil founded on October 12, 1702 (modern day Vaudreuil-Dorion, Vaudreuil-sur-le-Lac, L&#x27;Île-Cadieux, Saint-Lazare and Hudson
* Seigneurie de Soulanges founded on October 12, 1702 (modern day Saint-Clet, Coteau-du-Lac, Les Cèdres and Pointe-des-Cascades)
* Seigneurie de Rigaud founded on October 29, 1732 (modern day Rigaud, Sainte-Marthe, Pointe-Fortune and Très-Saint-Rédempteur)
* Seigneurie de Nouvelle-Longueuil founded on April 21, 1734 (modern day Saint-Polycarpe, Saint-Télesphore, Saint-Zotique, Les Coteaux et Rivière-Beaudette)
* Canton Newton founded in August 1791 (modern day Sainte-Justine-de-Newton, not part of the seigneurie system, was modeled after British township system)

The seigneurial system was finally abolished in 1854, nearly a century after Great Britain took over the territory after defeating France in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

It is the only county in Quebec that lies both south of the Ottawa River and north of the St. Lawrence River. Great Britain wanted to keep most of the French-speaking, ethnic French population of the area within Lower Canada during the 1791 division of Upper and Lower Canada (precursors to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec). It is geographically isolated from the Montérégie region south of the St. Lawrence.

The name relates to the historical division of the area into two counties: Vaudreuil County -- (named after Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, governor of New France) for the communities along the Ottawa River, and Soulanges County -- (named after Pierre-Jacques Joybert de Soulanges from Soulanges, Marne, France) for the communities along the St. Lawrence. Soulanges is a name of Québécois derivation, referring to its southerliness.

Since the RCM formation on 14 April 1982, the division of the county into &quot;Vaudreuil&quot; and &quot;Soulanges&quot; is still salient. The &quot;Vaudreuil&quot; area (consisting of the municipalities of Vaudreuil-Dorion, Saint-Lazare, Hudson, L&#x27;Île-Perrot, and others) is closer to Montreal. It is more suburban, populous, and economically and ethnically diverse. By contrast, the Soulanges area (including the municipalities of Saint-Polycarpe, Saint-Zotique, Coteau-du-Lac, Rivière-Beaudette and Les Coteaux) is predominantly rural, agricultural, and ethnically French-Canadian.

Owing to the county&#x27;s geographic isolation within Quebec, and its growing population as a suburb of the city of Montreal, Elections Canada assigned the electoral district to the county in 1997.

==Subdivisions==
There are 23 subdivisions within the RCM:

;Cities &amp; Towns (10)
* Coteau-du-Lac
* Hudson
* L&#x27;Île-Cadieux
* L&#x27;Île-Perrot
* Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Île-Perrot

<doc id="656688" wikidata="Q280092" url="?curid=656688" title="Jane Child">
<text>Jane Richmond Hyslop (born 15 February 1967), known professionally as Jane Child, is a Canadian singer, songwriter and record-producer best known for her hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Fall in Love&quot;. She is also known for her unusual fashion style, which included a hairstyle made of spikes and ankle-length braids and a nose chain piercing.

==Early life==
Child was born in Toronto, and is the daughter of noted Canadian classical musician Ricky Hyslop, while her mother was a singer and pianist. She has two brothers. Child was classically trained as a pianist during her youth. Her parents taught her how to play and sing by kindergarten. The first record she ever owned was the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, purchased by her father so that she could learn the arrangement of &quot;Michelle&quot;. Her exposure to funk music came from having Christmases in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and listening to local music there on the beaches.

At age 12 she joined the Canadian Opera Company&#x27;s children&#x27;s chorus, and soon after studied piano briefly at the Royal Conservatory of Music under Samuel Dolin. At age 15 she dropped out of school despite good grades. While seeking a summer job she saw an ad in a newspaper for a band looking for a keyboardist, which she applied for and joined. It was a touring rock and roll band of Deadheads known as &quot;Summerhill&quot; that played remote northern Canadian towns, and paid her $25 a week. She played the synthesizer, piano, and organ, and sang in their shows for over 45 weeks in their first year together. She also had various other musical jobs, such as organist at the Anglican church in her neighbourhood and at horse-shows, playing piano for ballet classes and at piano bars, and recording jingles for commercials.

==Career==
Eventually Child cut a demo tape in Hamilton, Ontario with the engineer who owned the studio where she had been recording jingles. With a low budget, she would bus out to the studio and play all the instruments herself. Child was signed by a New York based production company after a partner in the company, who was a client of Child&#x27;s entertainment lawyer, heard the tape. She subsequently relocated to New York and then Los Angeles. Adamant about producing her own music, Child left the label. After a bidding war with 13 other labels, she settled with Warner Bros. Records, who agreed to sign her on her own terms. At this time she was struggling to pay bills despite extravagant nights out for label meetings. One of her first potential breaks was when a publishing company sent a song she wrote to Maurice White, but in the end he chose not to record the song despite liking it.

Her debut album, &quot;Jane Child&quot;, released in 1989, was fully written and produced by Child, who also performed all the vocals and played all the instruments (except for the guitar parts), a rarity for a debut artist signed to a major label. Due to her musical style and her emphasis on control over her music, she was at the time labelled by the press as &quot;the female Prince&quot;.

She is best known for the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Fall in Love&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1990. The song was also a big hit on the R&amp;B chart - a rarity for a white artist - peaking at No. 6. Her previous single, &quot;Welcome to the Real World&quot;, was a modest hit, peaking at No. 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1993, she released her second album, &quot;Here Not There&quot;. In the album, she broadened her R&amp;B sound to mix it with traces of rock, grunge, and Eastern music. The album and its singles were commercial failures, and she was dropped from the label and kept a low profile for the rest of the decade, though releasing a few collaborations with Japanese artists in that country.

In 2001, she re-recorded the song &quot;World Lullabye&quot; from her debut album and sold the single through her website. All proceeds were donated to the Twin Towers Fund.

Her third album, &quot;Surge&quot;, was released in early 2002 on her own label, Sugarwave.

She recorded a cover of Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need Another Hero&quot; for the tribute album, &quot;What&#x27;s Love? A Tribute to Tina Turner&quot;, released in 2004.

In the &quot;Just Dance&quot; video game franchise, she contributed vocals to cover songs for &quot;Just Dance 2016&quot; and &quot;Just Dance 2017&quot;.

==Artistry==
Child&#x27;s look was inspired by African and East Indian cultures, as well as the punk movement, which came from living amongst these diasporas in Toronto. Her notable hair style, which she started at the age of 17, would be redone once a month by 3 women taking 14 hours to do. Her musical influences included Stevie Wonder, the Sex Pistols, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Public Enemy, Mozart, Indian music, Alicia de Larrocha, and Glenn Gould.

Child would do her own cataloguing for programming, including the samples and sequences, often for 14 hours at a time. She writes left handed and would sing as she wrote, also coming up with the bass line with her left hand. In studio some of the gear she used included Fairlight, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 and T-8, LinnDrum, E-mu SP12, Synclavier, Roland MSQ-700 and the Roland SBX-80. For tours her gear included a Minimoog, a Solina (ARP String Ensemble), a Mini-Korg, a Hammond B3 with a Leslie 145, and a Yamaha CP-70 electric grand.

==Personal life==
Child has been married to Cat Gray, the chief musician on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, since 2004.

In 1990, she purchased the 1917 Los Angeles house of Vidah Bickford, a locally based guitarist and mandolinist. She enjoys collecting Citroens and antiques.

<doc id="656694" wikidata="Q2975386" url="?curid=656694" title="The Art of Happiness">
<text>The Art of Happiness (Riverhead, 1998, ) is a book by the 14th Dalai Lama and Howard Cutler, a psychiatrist who posed questions to the Dalai Lama. Cutler quotes the Dalai Lama at length, providing context and describing some details of the settings in which the interviews took place, as well as adding his own reflections on issues raised.

The book explores training the human outlook that alters perception. The concepts that the purpose of life is happiness, that happiness is determined more by the state of one&#x27;s mind than by one&#x27;s external conditions, circumstances, or events—at least once one&#x27;s basic survival needs are met and that happiness can be achieved through the systematic training of our hearts and minds.

==Chapter summaries==

===Part I. The Purpose of Life===

====Chapter 1: The Right to Happiness====
&quot;I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear, whether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking something better in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happiness…” (13). The Dalai Lama spoke this powerful statement at a conference in Arizona among a crowd of people. Chapter one, The Right to Happiness, introduces what the book; the Art of Happiness is about.

Psychiatrist Howard Cutler followed the Dalai Lama around on this tour. Cutler, as well as many of his patients, believed that happiness was “ill defined, elusive, and ungraspable” (14). He also noted that the word ‘happy’ was derived from the term luck or chance (14). His stance on happiness changed after spending some time with this peace leader.

“When I say ‘training the mind,’ in this context I&#x27;m not referring to ‘mind’ merely as one&#x27;s cognitive ability or intellect. Rather I&#x27;m using the term in the sense of the Tibetan word Sem, it includes intellect and feeling, heart and mind. By bringing about a certain inner discipline we can undergo a transformation of our attitude, our entire outlook and approach to living&quot; (15).

The purpose of our life is to seek happiness was the phrase that stuck with him out of every other word the Dalai Lama spoke. After later examining some previous experiments, he came to this conclusion: unhappy people tend to be self-focused, withdrawn, brooding and even antagonistic. “On the other hand, happy people tend to be more sociable, flexible, and creative and are able to tolerate life’s daily frustrations more easily than unhappy people.” (16)

The Dalai Lama sees happiness as an objective: people setting goals and working to achieve them thus creating happiness in oneself.

====Chapter 2: The Sources of Happiness====
Chapter 1 talks about how to train the mind to become happier; with Chapter 2, we can figure out our sources of happiness or unhappiness. This chapter starts by explaining how a woman being able to retire at age 32 is at a higher level of happiness, but she soon returns to her happiness level before early retirement. Compared to this story, a man is told he&#x27;s HIV positive, which brings him to a lower level of happiness, but he soon begins to appreciate everyday life more (19–20). These two examples in the book help explain how “happiness is determined more by one’s state of mind than by external events” (20). Being at a life&#x27;s high, winning the lottery, or being at a low, diagnosed with cancer, we eventually get back to our baseline level. This baseline level is described in the book as how we react to life-changing news; even then our lives will reach a normal baseline again (21).

Relating to the baseline theory, we have very comparing minds with one another and within ourselves. The book explains how we compare incomes and success, which leads to unhappiness, but we need to flip this state of mind to compare with the less fortunate to appreciate what we have (22–23). According to the Dalai Lama, “If you harbor hateful thoughts or intense anger deep within yourself, then it ruins your health; thus it destroys one of the factors for happiness” (25). We are born into a certain state of mind about happiness, but we can change our outlook by being happier in each moment. For example, we can find more happiness with ourselves through self-worth. Self-worth, according to the Dalai Lama, is having a source of affection, compassion, and a sense of dignity (32). We need a strong sense of contentment to feel happier without obtaining objects, which assists in finding self-worth. Along with material things, we need to be able to decide what is going to bring us happiness or just pleasure. We have to reflect on what will ultimately bring us positive or negative consequences when dealing with a positive or negative action we perform to bring us satisfaction (28). We must ask ourselves if a certain object/action will make us happier or bring us pleasure.

====Chapter 3: Training the Mind for Happiness====
First step is learning. Analyse thoughts and emotions to determine if they are beneficial or hurtful. Try not to &quot;want.&quot; If you know something may tempt you avoid it. Positive desires are good.

====Chapter 4: Reclaiming our Innate State of Happiness====
The ability to be happy is in everyone&#x27;s nature. Happiness is found through love, affection, closeness and compassion. Not only do humans have the capability of being happy, but also the Dalai Lama believes that each human naturally has a gentle quality within them. The Dalai Lama supports this theory by mentioning ‘Buddha nature’, the Buddhist doctrine, but also saying that gentleness is not only affected by religion but in everyday life. With gentleness comes aggression, however. People argue that aggression is the dominant behavior for the human race. In response, the Dalai Lama says, “anger, violence and aggression may certainly arise, but I think it&#x27;s on a secondary or more superficial level; in a sense, they arise when we are frustrated in our efforts to achieve love and affection” (54–55). Although aggression can occur, overall our fundamental nature is gentleness. The Dalai Lama believes that because of the advancement in human intelligence we are believed to be capable of controlling our aggression versus our kindness; however, if the intellect level were to decrease then the result would be destructive. So, overall, the Dalai Lama believes that although it is possible to go down the path of aggression there is always the natural ability to be compassionate again. The compassion towards one&#x27;s self as humans has to be equally distributed to others. “Reaching out to help others may be as fundamental to our nature as communication” (59). This suggests the idea that humans are “programmed with the capacity and purpose of bringing pleasure and joy to others” (61). Overall, happiness is reached by keeping peace with others and one&#x27;s self, which can be reached through meditation and community service. Therefore, the Dalai Lama concludes that the purpose isn&#x27;t to create tension but a positive atmosphere. This gives our life meaning, which leads to overall happiness. That positive atmosphere can be found through closeness and compassion.

===Part II. Human Warmth and Compassion===

====Chapter 5: A New Model for Intimacy====
Compassion and intimacy are two of the strongest emotions a person can achieve. It is impossible to find these emotions solely within ourselves. We are constantly trying to search for another to be compassionate about, or intimate with. One needs to approach others with a positive attitude, to create an open and friendly atmosphere. Being openly friendly with others, allows one to be compassionate. “We have to maintain an attitude of friendship and warmth in order to lead a way of life in which there is enough interaction with other people to enjoy a happy life” (Dalai Lama, 69).

Intimacy is the central core of our existence. It creates openness with others, which is necessary for a happy lifestyle. According to the Dalai Lama intimacy is “...having one special person with whom you can share your deepest feelings, fears, and so on” (76). The Dalai Lama&#x27;s opinion is supported by research of Cutler, as he writes “Medical researchers have found that people who have close friendships, and have people they can turn to for affirmation, empathy, and affection are more likely to survive health challenges such as heart attacks, major surgeries and are less likely to develop diseases and cancer” (78). Intimacy is also physical closeness. “The desire for intimacy is the desire to share ones innermost self with another” (The Dalai Lama, 81). One can express himself too much also. Once a person has opened oneself completely to everyone, the special intimacy is lost, and it is hard to satisfy the need of connection with one special person. “The model intimacy is based on the willingness to open ourselves to many others, to family, friends, and even strangers, forming genuine and deep bonds based on common humanity” (Dalai Lama, 84). By opening oneself to the world around us, it creates the opportunity to form special bonds with someone new, or build upon a relationship one may already have.

====Chapter 6: Deepening Our Connection to Others====
According to Chapter 5, Howard C. Cutler also asks The Dalai Lama a question about connections and relationships between people: &quot;What would you say is the most effective method or technique of connecting with others in a meaningful way and of reducing conflicts with others?&quot; The Dalai Lama says that there is no formula or exact example for all problems.(87) The Dalai Lama believes that empathy is the key to be more warm and compassionate in connections to others. He thinks that it is very important and extremely helpful to be able to try to put ourselves in the other person&#x27;s place and see how would we react to the situation.(89) To show compassion and try to understand the background of other people. Cutler also writes a few stories/experiences from his life. For instance when he was in an argument with someone and his reaction was inappropriate without trying to understand and appreciate what the other person might think – no empathy.

The Dalai Lama does not just refer to caring for each other; he also finds relationships very important and differentiates them in two ways.(111) The first is when you are in a relationship with someone because of wealth, power or position (material) – when these things disappear, the relationship normally ends. The second way is based on true human feelings (spiritual). The Dalai Lama also informs about sexual relationships. You can have a sexual relationship with no respect for each other. Usually it is just temporary satisfaction. Or sexual relationships bonded with a person who we think is kind, nice and gentle.(101–102)

After discussing relationships and sexual relationships in general, The Dalai Lama continues to speak about love. He does not believe in true love – in falling in love. His opinion on this subject is very negative; he describes idealized romantic love as a fantasy and that it is unattainable – just simply not worth it. (111) But he also says that closeness and intimacy are some of the most important components of human happiness.(112)

According to Chapter 6 we can say that the Dalai Lama clearly represents his opinions on human relationships, empathy and sexual attraction, and he tries to explain them in a simple way. These are the most important and most discussed topics in Chapter 6. We find out how empathy is needed in human relationships. That understanding and trying to appreciate the other person&#x27;s emotional background is priceless. Also that relationships are either materially or spiritually based. On the other hand, the Dalai Lama does not believe in love and describes it as a fantasy or imagination, although he thinks that true relationships are based on true human feelings. All these new information are related to Chapter 7&#x27;s main topic which is basically about the value and benefits of compassion.

====Chapter 7: The Value and Benefits of Compassion====

This chapter is composed of defining compassion and the value of human life. The Dalai Lama defines compassion as a “state of mind that is nonviolent, nonharming, and nonaggressive” (114). This feeling of compassion is broken down into two types. First is compassion associated with attachment. Using this type of compassion alone is biased and unstable, which causes certain emotional attachments that are not necessarily good. The second type is genuine compassion that “is based on others&#x27; fundamental rights rather than your own mental projection” (115). This type of compassion is also defined “as the feeling of unbearableness” (116). Accepting another&#x27;s suffering brings that person a sense of connectedness and gives us a willingness to reach out for others. Associating oneself with this type of fundamental rights generates love and compassion. According to the Dalai Lama the reason he separated compassion into two types was because “the feeling of genuine compassion is much stronger, much wider [and] has a profound quality” (116). Using genuine compassion creates a special connection that you cannot achieve with associating compassion with attachments.

The Dalai Lama believes that compassion “provides the basis of human survival” (119). People reflect off their own experiences and this contributes to their knowledge of compassion. If people feel there is no need to develop compassion then it&#x27;s because they are being blocked by &quot;ignorance and shortsightedness&quot; (121). This can be caused by not seeing the physical and emotional benefits of having a compassionate mindset. When one completely understands the importance of compassion, then it &quot;gives you a feeling of conviction and determination&quot; (125). Having this determination can bring one to have a compassionate mindset.

There have been numerous studies that support the idea that “developing compassion and altruism has a positive impact on our physical and emotional health” (126). James House found that “interacting with others in warm and compassionate ways, dramatically increased life expectancy, and probably overall vitality as well” (126). These studies have concluded that there is a direct correlation to compassion and physical and emotional health. The next chapter tells how to cope with suffering, from the loss of a loved one.

===Part III. Transforming Suffering===

====Chapter 8: Facing Suffering====
Throughout this chapter the Dalai Lama gives examples of how different people dealt with losing a loved one. The Dalai Lama states that he believes it is a good idea to prepare yourself ahead of time for the kinds of suffering you might encounter, because sometime in life you are going to experience some type of suffering, so if you prepare yourself you will know what to expect. He goes on about how everyone is going to face suffering sometime in their life and if we view suffering as something natural then we can begin to live a happier life. If you can prepare yourself for the fact that in your life you&#x27;re going to experience a traumatic event, for example a death of a family member, you can face the fact that everybody in life eventually passes on and you&#x27;ll be able to get over the grieving process sooner and carry on with a happier life knowing that they&#x27;re in a better place. The Buddhist recognizes the possibility of clearing the mind and achieving a state in which there is no more suffering in people&#x27;s lives. If you come to the fact and realize you are suffering you&#x27;ll overcome it faster rather than denying that everything is all right.

Getting through suffering is a very difficult thing to accomplish but there are people out there who can help you overcome you losing a loved one or whatever you may be suffering from. Everyone has to go through suffering sometime in their life, but how people get over it shows how strong that person is. How someone perceives life as a whole plays a huge role in a person&#x27;s attitude about pain and suffering. There is a possibility of freedom from suffering. That is possible by removing the causes of suffering and living a happier life.

====Chapter 9: Self-Created Suffering====

====Chapter 10: Shifting Perspective====
The chapter begins with many quotes from the Dalai Lama. He talks about how you can always change your perspective of something if you just step back and change your view. Also in this chapter he goes on to talk about your enemies in life. The Dalai Lama talks about how having enemies in life in the end helps you out, you just have to change your view or perspective. The author also goes on to talk about how all this stuff is still practical in today&#x27;s world. In this chapter the Dalai Lama keeps stressing the importance of practicing patience. One big part of this chapter was the talk about finding balance. The Dalai Lama goes on to talk about how living well has to do with a big part of having balance in your life. He also talks about how you need both physical and emotional balance in your life. He also goes on to say that one should not go to extremes with anything; if you have a balanced life you will not go to extremes with anything. He thinks that narrow-minded people are the ones who go to extremes and this results in trouble and danger.

====Chapter 11: Finding Meaning in Pain and Suffering====
While chapter ten talks about shifting your perspective, chapter 11 talks about finding the meaning in pain and suffering, turning them into something you can reflect upon yourself. Viktor Frankl was a Jewish psychiatrist and was imprisoned by the Nazis. He had a brutal experience in a concentration camp and gained insight into how people survived the atrocities (199). He observed that those who survived did so not because of youth or physical strength, but the strength derived from purpose. Being able to find meaning in suffering is powerful because it helps us cope even during the most difficult times in our lives. Being able to feel the rewards, we must search for meaning when things are going well for us too (200). For many people the search starts with religion. They give some examples from Buddhist and Hindu models. For our faith and trust in His plan allows us to tolerate our suffering more easily and trusting His plan he has for us. They give an example on how pain can be a good thing such as childbirth. It is very painful to give birth but the reward is having the child. Having suffering can strengthen us in many ways because it can test and strengthen our faith, it can bring us closer to God in a very fundamental and intimate way, or it can loosen the bonds to the material world and make us clever to God as our refuge (201). Clever to God means being or feeling closer to him and knowing what you should do.

They talk about the Mahayana visualization practice, it&#x27;s where you mentally visualize taking on another person&#x27;s pain and suffering and in return you give them all of your resources, good health, fortune and so on (203). When doing this you reflect on yourself and look at your situation and then look at the others and see if their situation is worse and if so you tell yourself that you could have it as bad as them or worse. By realizing your suffering you will develop greater resolve to put an end to the causes of suffering and the unwholesome deeds that lead to suffering. It will increase your enthusiasm for engaging in the wholesome actions and deeds that lead to happiness and joy. When you are aware of your pain and suffering it helps you to develop your amount of empathy. Allow you to relate to other people&#x27;s feelings and suffering. Our attitude may begin to change because our sufferings may not be as worthless and as bad as we may think. Dr. Paul Brand went to India and explored over there and looked at how people suffered physical pain. He says it is a good thing we have physical pain because if we didn&#x27;t then how would we know that something is wrong with our bodies? (207) If we did not feel pain we would harm our bodies because we could stick our hands into fire. Not every practice may work for everyone. Everyone just has to try and figure out their own way of dealing with suffering and turning it into a positive feedback.

===Part IV. Overcoming Obstacles===

====Chapter 12: Bringing About Change====
The Dalai Lama thought of bringing change to the cause of the pain and suffering in this chapter.

====Chapter 13: Dealing with Anger and Hatred====
The Dalai Lama says how to deal with Anger and hatred, he keeps on going to say to deal with anger we should have positive thoughts.

====Chapter 14: Dealing with Anxiety and Building Self-Esteem====

===Part V. Closing Reflections on Living a Spiritual Life===

====Chapter 15: Basic Spiritual Values====
The beginning of the chapter discusses how the art of happiness has many different components. It talks about what the book has established so far about happiness—how we need to understand the truest sources of happiness and set our priorities in life based on the cultivation of those sources. Then it introduces us to the final chapter about spirituality.

The author goes on to talk about how when people hear the word &quot;spirituality&quot; they automatically think it goes with religion. He says that despite the Dalai Lama having a shaved head and wearing robes, they had normal conversations like two normal people.

The Dalai Lama says that having a process of mental development is key. We need to appreciate our potential as human beings and recognize the importance of our inner transformation. He talks about how there are two different levels of spirituality (295). One level is to do with religious beliefs; he says that he thinks each individual should take their own spiritual path that best fits them and their mental disposition, natural inclination, temperament, and cultural background (305).

Lama says that all religions can make an effective contribution for the benefit of humanity; they are designed to make the individual a happier person and the world a better place and we should respect them (305).

At the end of the chapter he talks about how deep religious faith has sustained countless people through difficult times. He tells a story about a man named Terry Anderson who was kidnapped off the streets in Beirut in 1985. After seven years of being held as a prisoner by Hezbollah, a group of Islamic fundamentalist extremists, he was finally released. The world found him a man overjoyed and happy to be reunited with his family and he said that prayers and religion got him through those seven years (303). This is the main example Lama used.

<text>Freedom in Exile: The Autobiography of the Dalai Lama is the second autobiography of the 14th Dalai Lama, released in 1991. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s first autobiography, &quot;My Land and My People&quot;, was published in 1962, a few years after he reestablished himself in India and before he became an international celebrity. He regards both of the autobiographies as authentic and re-issued &quot;My Land and My People&quot; in 1997 to coincide with the release of the film &quot;Kundun&quot;.

== Background ==

In the introduction, the Dalai Lama explains that he wrote the book &quot;to counter Chinese claims and misinformation&quot; about the history of Tibet. The title &quot;Freedom in exile&quot; refers to the freedoms he says that India offers to him.

The idea for a second autobiography came from a British journalist, Alexander Norman, in the 1980s, who sat and taped the Dalai Lama for &quot;several hours at a time&quot; and wrote the book out of the manuscripts.

== Synopsis ==

The autobiography starts with the Dalai Lama&#x27;s &quot;birth to a family of small farmers&quot;, selection as the Dalai Lama, tumultuous relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (in which he claims many atrocities), and subsequent life in India. The book acknowledges &quot;the cultural gaps between traditional Tibetan Buddhism and the scientific approaches of the West&quot;, and also elucidates the points of similarity between the two.

The autobiography also criticizes the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for supporting the Tibetan independence movement &quot;not because they (the CIA) cared about Tibetan independence, but as part of their worldwide efforts to destabilize all communist governments&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Freedom in Exile&quot; was timed to be released around the anti-Communist Revolutions of 1989, and the Dalai Lama&#x27;s winning of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. The book was generally well-received in the West. In a review, Rembert Weakland called the book &quot;a call for freedom&quot;.

<text>A trow was a type of cargo boat found in the past on the rivers Severn and Wye in Great Britain and used to transport goods.

==Features==

The mast could be taken down so that the trow could go under bridges, such as the bridge at Worcester and the many bridges up and downstream. The mast was stepped in a three sided frame open at the rear but closed with an iron pin or rope lashing. From the top of the mast a forestay ran down to the bow winch. To lower the mast the pin was removed and the winch slackened off to let the mast fall towards the stern. The reverse operation pulled the mast up.

Despite their flat-bottomed hull form which made volume available for their load and permitted drying out on muddy banks in the tidal area where they operated, Trows were seaworthy. For example, with an added keel the Droitwich Trow &quot;Hastings&quot; is recorded as taking 90 tons of salt from Droitwich to France across the English Channel. The flat-bottomed trows sailed on the sea by hauling a log of wood under the hull strapped with chains to act as a temporary keel, to limit leeway (the hull sliding sideways under lateral sail pressure on their fore-and-aft rig).
==Types==
There are two traditional types of Severn Trow. Prior to the 1840s the River Severn was tidal up to Worcester. The trows that were used on the tidal portion of the River were called &quot;Downstream Trows&quot; whilst those that sailed north of Worcester were called &quot;Upstream Trows&quot; and were smaller. During the summer the flow of water was often very low and so the trows were pulled over the resultant shallows. A rope was attached to the mast and the men who pulled the boats were called &quot; bow hauliers&quot;. The men would enter into a contract with the captain of the trow in the many pubs along the Severn riverbanks, and there was a right of way along the bankside. A document originally published in 1940 about such vessels states that the term &quot;trow&quot; is &quot;believed to have been derived from the same root as the word &#x27;trough&#x27;&quot;.

A Trow called &quot;Joan&quot; was owned by a timber merchant called Oliver Luff. He used her to bring timber from Tintern, Monmouthshire into &#x27;The Back&#x27; now called &#x27;Welsh Back&#x27; in Bristol&#x27;s Floating Harbour, where he owned two timber yards. A pub, the Llandoger Trow is situated in Bristol.

A replica Wye trow, named &quot;Hereford Bull&quot;, was constructed in 2012 to participate in the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant.

The last complete Severn trow still in existence, the Downstream Trow &quot;Spry&quot;, went into operation on 25 October 1894 and worked in the Bristol Channel, primarily moving limestone from quarries in the Chepstow area to the Cardiff, Wales area in her early years. A reliable source states that &quot;she was originally sloop rigged, with a jib, staysail, topsail and gaff main,&quot; as well as a mast believed to have been fixed. Her condition deteriorated over the years, becoming derelict. The &quot;Spry&quot; was rebuilt with many new components; the effort began in 1983 and was not fully completed until 1992. She is currently on display at the Blists Hill site of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums in a dry location (not on water).

A smaller ( max) boat called a &#x27;Trow&#x27; is peculiar to the Fleet lagoon in Dorset. It is used primarily for the transport of mackerel caught by seine net fishing crews off Chesil Beach. Once caught they are boxed and transported across to the mainland by these flat-bottomed boats. Unlike the River Severn version the Fleet variant is only ever towed, rowed or punted and has no mast or sail.

== Pronunciation ==
Trow may be pronounced as trō (rhyming with &quot;crow&quot;) or as trou (rhyming with &quot;cow&quot;). The former pronunciation was the usual one throughout Worcestershire, Shropshire and Dorset. While the latter exists regionally, dictionaries often give only the former pronunciation.

<doc id="656700" wikidata="Q3388" url="?curid=656700" title="Grossglockner">
<text>The Großglockner ( ), or just Glockner, is, at 3,798 metres above the Adriatic (12,461 ft), the highest mountain in Austria and highest mountain in the Alps east of the Brenner Pass. It is part of the larger Glockner Group of the Hohe Tauern range, situated along the main ridge of the Central Eastern Alps and the Alpine divide. The Pasterze, Austria&#x27;s most extended glacier, lies on the Grossglockner&#x27;s eastern slope.

The characteristic pyramid-shaped peak actually consists of two pinnacles, the &quot;Großglockner&quot; and the Kleinglockner (, from German: &quot;groß&quot; &#x27;big&#x27;, &quot;klein&quot; &#x27;small&#x27;), separated by the &quot;Glocknerscharte&quot; col.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Glocknerer&quot; is first documented in a 1561 map designed by the Viennese cartographer Wolfgang Lazius. The denotation &quot;Glogger&quot; is mentioned in a 1583 description of the Tyrolean Kals legal district, then referring to the whole ridge south of the Alpine main chain. In the 1760s, the &quot;Atlas Tyrolensis&quot; listed a &quot;Glockner Berg&quot;, the prefix &quot;Gross-&quot; (&quot;great&quot;) is not mentioned before the first expedition in 1799.

According to the scholar Belsazar Hacquet (1735–1815), &quot;Glockner&quot; is possibly derived from German: &quot;Glocke&quot; (&quot;bell&quot;), referring to the mountain&#x27;s characteristic shape. It may also be a Germanised version of the Alpine Slavic word &quot;Klek&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;), as maintained in the Slovene name &quot;Veliki Klek&quot;.

== Geography ==
=== Location and area ===

The Grossglockner lies on the border between the Austrian states of Carinthia and Tyrol (East Tyrol). The peak is part of the &quot;Glocknerkamm&quot; ridge in the Glockner Group that branches off the main chain of the Alps at Eiskögele, heading in a southeasterly direction and forming the boundary between the East Tyrolean municipality of Kals am Großglockner, about in the southwest at , and Carinthian Heiligenblut, about in the northeast at . This boundary is also the watershed between the Kals Valley and its Teischnitz and Ködnitz side valleys on the Tyrolean side and the Möll Valley with the Pasterze glacier on the Carinthian side. The region around the mountain has formed part of the Grossglockner-Pasterze special protected area within the High Tauern National Park since 1986.

The Glockner is the highest mountain in the Alps east of the Ortler range, about away, and, after Mont Blanc, has the second greatest topographic isolation of all mountains in the Alps. Even its topographic prominence, at , is the second highest after Mont Blanc in the entire Alps (see the list of Alpine peaks by prominence). That makes it one of the most independent peaks in the Alps. The view from the Grossglockner summit is one of the farthest of all mountains in the Eastern Alps. It ranges out to or, taking account of atmospheric refraction, almost . Its view over more than of the Earth&#x27;s surface reaches as far as the Upper Swabian Plateau in the northwest, to Regensburg and the peaks of the Bohemian Forest in the north, to Ortler in the west, to the Padan Plain in the south, and to Triglav and the Totes Gebirge range in the east.

=== Topography ===

The Grossglockner rock summit, due to its high Alpine, heavily glaciated appearance, is often compared to the mountains of the Western Alps. Together with the Kleinglockner to the southeast it forms a distinctive double peak. There are differing views in the literature as to whether the Kleinglockner is a subpeak or a separate main summit. Due to its low topographic prominence and isolation as well as its close links in climbing history, it is counted as part of that of the Grossglockner in historic publications; however, in view of its separate climbing routes it is counted as an independent peak in mountaineering literature.

The &quot;Obere Glocknerscharte&quot; between the two peaks, at , is the highest col in Austria, from which a couloir up to 55° in gradient and in altitude descends down to the &quot;Glocknerkees&quot; glacier, called &quot;Pallavicinirinne&quot; after the Austrian mountaineer Alfred von Pallavicini (1848–1886). It runs northeastwards and borders on the Northeast and North Faces of the Grossglockner. The latter faces are bounded by the Northwest Ridge, part of the main Glockner crest, which runs over the &quot;Grögerschneid&quot;, , and the ridge elevations of Glocknerhorn, , and Teufelshorn, , to the &quot;Untere Glocknerscharte&quot;, , which connects to the high Glocknerwand.

A prominent ridge, the &quot;Stüdlgrat&quot;, named after the Prague Alpinist Johann Stüdl (1839–1925), runs from the Grossglockner away to the southwest. Together with its extension, the &quot;Luisengrat&quot;, it separates the West Face and the &quot;Teischnitzkees&quot; glacier at its foot from the South Face and its &quot;Ködnitzkees&quot; glacier. A couloir known as the &quot;Pillwaxrinne&quot; crosses the South Face below the Obere Glocknerscharte; most of the South Face lies east of this gully below the Kleinglockner. The east side of the Kleinglockner, the &quot;Glocknerleitl&quot;, is glaciated to just below the summit and is continued by the &quot;Kleinglocknerkees&quot; and &quot;Hofmannskees&quot; before reaching the Pasterze.

== History ==

The history of the climbs started with French-born natural scientist Belsazar Hacquet, from 1773 professor of anatomy at the Academy of Ljubljana. He travelled the Eastern Alps from 1779 to 1781 and published an itinerary in 1783, describing the &quot;Glokner&quot; mountain and stating that it had not been climbed yet. He estimated the mountain&#x27;s height with converted and left an engraving illustrating Grossglockner and Pasterze, the first known depiction of the mountain.

===First ascent===
Inspired by Hacquet&#x27;s book and the first ascent of the Mont Blanc in 1786, the Gurk prince-bishop Count Franz Xaver of Salm (1749–1822) together with his vicar general Sigismund Ernst Hohenwart (1745–1825) and Baron Franz Xaver von Wulfen (1728–1805) started efforts for a Grossglockner expedition. They engaged two peasants from Heiligenblut as mountain guides to do the first explorations for an ascent through the Leitertal valley, which is the side of Grossglockner with the least ice (people feared glaciers in these times). These valiant men, called &quot;Glockners&quot; in the records, did more than they were ordered to do—and probably reached the Kleinglockner summit on 23 July 1799.

One month later the bishop&#x27;s expedition started: a mountain hut (the first Salm Hut) had been built and the path in the Leitertal valley was prepared so that the bishop could use a horse to reach it. 30 people, among them Salm, Hohenwart and Wulfen, were part of the expedition. They suffered with bad weather and a first effort failed, but on 25 August 1799 Hohenwart and at least four other people, including the two &quot;Glockners&quot;, reached—again—the Kleinglockner, where they installed one of the first summit crosses (one of the main goals of the church expedition). Hohenwart&#x27;s reports did not tell clearly that they had not touched the highest point but Bishop Salm (who had reached the &quot;Adlersruhe&quot; rock at ) was informed. Dissatisfied, he invited another, even bigger expedition the next year.

On 28 July 1800, 62 people, among them the pedagogue Franz Michael Vierthaler and the botanist David Heinrich Hoppe, started again into the Leitertal valley. Four peasants and carpenters (the &quot;Glockners&quot; and two others who are not known) did a track in the snow, had installed fixed ropes at some steeper sections up to the end of the Glocknerleitl, and even built a second refuge, called Hohenwarte Hut. The vanguard reached the Kleinglockner peak, however, according to the expedition records by the Dellach priest Franz Joseph Horasch (Orasch), only the four guides and Mathias Hautzendorfer, the local priest of the Rangersdorf parish, were able to cross the &quot;Obere Glocknerscharte&quot; and climb the Grossglockner summit. Hautzendorfer had to be persuaded to venture the step and administered the last rites in advance. 

The two &quot;Glockners&quot; are usually identified as the brothers Joseph (&quot;Sepp&quot;) and Martin Klotz, however, this surname is not listed in the Heiligenblut parish register. A local peasant named Sepp Hoysen is documented as a member of the second Grossglockner expedition in 1802, and the surveyor Ulrich Schiegg mentioned one Martin Reicher as &quot;Glockner&quot; guide. The peasants and several other members of the expedition (among them Schiegg and his young apprentice Valentin Stanič, who climbed Mt. Watzmann for the first time some weeks later) did the ascent again the next day and finally installed the summit cross and a barometer on the Grossglockner summit.

===Development===
Bishop Salm undertook two more ascents in 1802 (with Hohenwart reaching the summit) and in 1806, however, he himself never climbed beyond the &quot;Adlersruhe&quot; rock. The climbing of the Grossglockner was also described by the botanist Josef August Schultes, who explored the massif together with Count Apponyi in 1802. No further ascents were made during the Napoleonic Wars, the huts decayed and were plundered by locals. In the following &quot;Vormärz&quot; era, however, the mountain became a popular venue for Alpinists like Hermann and Adolf Schlagintweit, who all followed the route of the first ascent.

By the mid 19th century, the developing Alpine tourism began to alter the traditional agriculture economy in the Heiligenblut area. Therefore, the people of Kals tried to lay out a straight ascent from the western side, which however was not reached until Julius von Payer explored the ridge between &quot;Glöcknerleitl&quot; and &quot;Ködnitzkees&quot; in 1863. Johann Stüdl had a via ferrata erected along the southwestern ridge the next year and the &quot;Stüdlhütte&quot; erected at its foot in 1868. Already in 1869, most expeditions to the summit started in Kals. The first winter ascent of the Grossglockner was made on January 2, 1875 by William Adolf Baillie Grohman, a member of the Alpine Club. In 1876 Count Pallavicini and his guide Hans Tribusser undertook the first expedition up the steep glaciated Northeast Face, chopping 2,500 steps into the &quot;Pallavicinirinne&quot; in an ice climbing master stroke not repeated for 23 years.

In 1879 Count Pallavicini dedicated a new iron summit cross on the occasion of the silver wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and Empress Elisabeth; both had visited Heiligenblut and walked to the present-day &quot;Franz-Josefs-Höhe&quot; viewpoint in 1865. The cross was installed on 2 October 1880. Pallavicini also had the Archduke John Hut erected at the former &quot;Adlersruhe&quot; resting place of Bishop Salm, today the highest situated mountain hut in Austria. The Austrian Alpine Club built the new &quot;Salmhütte&quot; and the &quot;Glocknerhaus&quot; along the alpine route from Heiligenblut.

A first ascent by skiing was made in 1909 and the circumnavigation of the massif soon became a popular ski mountaineering tour. The Grossglockner became Austria&#x27;s highest mountain, when the South Tyrolean Ortler region had to be ceded to the Kingdom of Italy according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, which promoted its reputation as a tourist attraction.

== High Alpine Road ==
Mass tourism was decisively promoted by the scenic High Alpine Road (&quot;Großglockner-Hochalpenstraße&quot;) running from Heiligenblut to Bruck in Salzburg with a branch-off to the &quot;Franz-Josefs-Höhe&quot; viewpoint. It was built across the historic Hochtor Pass of the Alpine divide between 1930 and 1935 according to plans designed by engineer Franz Wallack. The pass road, Austria&#x27;s highest, reaches , and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country (second after Schönbrunn Palace) with about 270,000 vehicles and 900,000 visitors every year, about 50 million since its opening.
Also famous for its historic vehicle hill climb races.

<text>John Xantus de Vesey a.k.a. de Csíktaplócza (, 5 October 1825 – 13 December 1894) was a Hungarian exile and zoologist. Xantus (the aristocratic title &quot;de Vesey&quot; was an affectation, of which he had several variations) was born Xántus János, in Csokonya, Somogy, Hungary.

Trained as a lawyer, he served as an officer in the nationalist uprisings of 1848–1849 in the Hungarian Army. Captured and exiled to Prague, he was arrested again, and escaped to the United States via England in 1850. In the U.S. he pursued a variety of occupations, including bookseller, druggist, a teacher, and hospital steward in the U.S. Army. In the Army he met Dr. William Alexander Hammond, a collector for the noted zoologist Spencer Fullerton Baird.

Working under Hammond as an assistant surgeon, he soon developed an interest in natural history and became a gifted collector himself. In 1860 he was stationed as a tidal observer at Cabo San Lucas, on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, where he collected natural history specimens for the United States National Museum. They still have a collection originating from him. While in Baja California, he published in Hungarian an account that purported to narrate his travels and observations of native antiquities, but which in fact was plagiarized from accounts referring to other regions. He corresponded extensively with Baird, and managed to use the support of Baird and Hammond (later Surgeon General of the United States Army), getting them to write letters of recommendation on his behalf. On the basis of these he was given a consular position in Mexico, a position he promptly lost after embarrassing the Department of State by recognising a local rebelling warlord. Soon after this he returned to Hungary.

In 1869 he joined the Austro-Hungarian East Asiatic Expedition, but left it late in 1869 and spent some time in Sarawak before returning to Hungary late in 1870. 

For 30 years until his death in Budapest in 1894 he served as the Director of the Zoological Garden of Budapest and as curator of ethnography at the Hungarian National Museum, as well as undertaking collecting expeditions in Asia.

Several zoological and botanical taxa have been named for him:

Animals:
*&quot;Synthliboramphus hypoleucus&quot; – Xantus&#x27;s murrelet [also known as Guadalepe murrelet; considered conspecific with Scripps&#x27; Murrelet until 2012]
*&quot;Hylocharis xantusii&quot; – Xantus&#x27;s hummingbird
*&quot;Labrisomus xanti&quot; – largemouth blenny, rock blenny
*&quot;Halichoeres xanti&quot; – earmuff wrasse (current scientific name, &quot;Halichoeres bicolor&quot;)
*&quot;Umbrina xanti&quot; – Polla drum, golden drum, golden croaker
*&quot;Phyllodactylus xanti&quot; – Xantus&#x27; leaf-toed gecko, leaf-toed gecko
*&quot;Portunus xantusii&quot; – Xantus&#x27; swimming crab
*Xantusiidae, the night-lizards family, plus the subfamily Xantusiinae, and the genus &quot;Xantusia&quot;

Plants:
*&quot;Clarkia xantiana&quot; – Xantus&#x27; clarkia, gunsight fairyfan
*&quot;Euphorbia xanti&quot; – shrubby euphorbia
*&quot;Chaenactis xantiana&quot; – Xantus&#x27; pincushion, Mojave pincushion
*&quot;Chorizanthe xanti&quot; – Xantus&#x27; spineflower
*&quot;Polygala xanti&quot; – Xantus&#x27;s milkwort
*&quot;Mimosa xanti&quot;
*&quot;Solanum xanti&quot;

<text>Słubice () is a border town in the Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland. Located on the Oder river, it lies directly opposite the city of Frankfurt (Oder) in Germany, which it was a part of as &quot;Dammvorstadt&quot; until 1945. As of 2019, the town had a population of 16,705, with an urban agglomeration of Słubice-Frankfurt counting 85,000 inhabitants. It is the capital of Słubice County and the administrative seat of the Gmina Słubice. It is part of the historical region of Lubusz Land.

==History==

The name is a modern Polish version of &quot;Zliwitz&quot;, a West Slavic settlement east of the Brandendamm causeway across the Oder, mentioned in Frankfurt&#x27;s city charter of 1253. Until 1249 it was part of the Polish Lubusz Land, which since 1138 in different periods formed part of the Greater Polish or Silesian provinces of then fragmented Poland. In 1225 &quot;Zliwitz&quot; was granted staple rights by Henry the Bearded. The Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg had purchased the Lubusz Land from the Silesian Duke Bolesław II the Bald in 1249. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the area came under the control of the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1319 Wartislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania granted new privileges to the town of Frankfurt (Oder), which today&#x27;s Słubice was already part of. The area fell again to Brandenburg in 1324. Between 1373 and 1415 it was part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or the &quot;Czech Lands&quot;), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty.

In early 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of prisoners of various nationalities from the dissolved camp in Świecko to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp passed through the town.

Słubice is closely linked to its German sister city Frankfurt (Oder), of which it was a part until 1945. The two cities have been forced apart by the drawing of the Oder–Neisse line, which drew the Polish-German border through the city. The two cities share many urban amenities and collaborate on various projects, such as a wastewater treatment plant in Słubice that serves both towns, as well as the Collegium Polonicum extension of some of the Viadrina European University&#x27;s departments on the Polish side of the border. Furthermore, Słubice is part of a special Słubice-Kostrzyn Economic Zone.

==Climate==
Słubice has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;).
==Culture==

Słubice was the setting for the 2003 film &quot;Distant Lights&quot; (&quot;Lichter&quot;) as well as for scenes in the 2002 film &quot;Grill Point&quot;.

On October 22, 2014, a monument to Wikipedia editors by Mihran Hakobyan was unveiled in the town, the first such honoring of the worldwide Wikipedian community.

==Transport==
The National roads 29 and 31, and the Voivodeship road 137 run through the town, and the A2 motorway, part of the European route E30, runs nearby, south of the town.

==Cuisine==
The officially protected traditional food of Słubice and the county is &quot;schab tradycyjny słubicki&quot;, a local type of smoked &quot;schab&quot; (pork loin), a popular traditional Christmas dish in the area (as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland).

==Sports==
Polonia Słubice football club is based in Słubice. Polonia&#x27;s home ground is the OSiR Stadium.

<doc id="656705" wikidata="Q2095445" url="?curid=656705" title="PRISA TV">
<text>PRISA Televisión, S.A.U (PRISA TV) is a pay TV company in Spain.

==History and profile==
PRISA TV was established in 1989 and controlled (as of 2007) by PRISA. It was amongst the pioneer companies in the market to introduce interactive systems and specially digital television in Spain. In October 2010 the company changed its name from Sogecable to PRISA TV.

The company mainly manages and acquires audio-visual rights, but also distributes and produces channels. Another of its main activities is the production and distribution of cinematographic exhibitions.

Its restructuring process began in October 2003, and finished in December 2004, with the integration of Vía Digital. They were trying this way to reorder Sogecable&#x27;s activities absorbing the commitments with thematic channels, suppliers with audio-visual rights and other services. With this, restructuring the company contributed to the audio-visual recovery in Spain.

The producer of Sogecable is Sogecine. It is one of the principal distributors and producers in the Spanish territory, with special importance in the last years.

Sogecable&#x27;s facilities are in Tres Cantos, in Madrid, producing every day 23 television channels, including nine versions of Canal+ and other 14 channels that are specialised in, sports, cinema, documentaries, children and music. These are watched and distributed across Digital+ (via satellite), cable and ADSL.

In 2005, the group offered a new free television channel, the fifth one in Spain. Its name is Cuatro and occupies the same frequency that Canal+ did up to then. Canal+ then passed to form part only in Digital+ on 7 November 2005.

In 2006 PRISA made a public acquisition bid on 20% of Sogecable&#x27;s actions to increase its participation up to almost 50%. Prisa increased its stake above the 50% mark in late 2007, triggering a mandatory (by Spanish law) bid for the remainder of the shares. At the close of the offer period on 12 May 2008, Prisa announced that it held over 95% of Sogecable&#x27;s share capital.

Sogecable is also the main shareholder in Audiovisual Sport (AVS), which owns the TV rights of most Spanish La Liga soccer games. AVS is the company responsible for the lack of Spanish Primera football international coverage after a dispute with Mediapro. Sogecable claims that it is owed €58 million and will not allow Real Madrid or Barcelona games from being played internationally until this debt is paid by Mediapro.

In 2006, Rodolfo Martín Villa was appointed chairman of Sogecable. His term ended in 2010 and Manuel Polanco replaced him in the post.

On May 6, 2014, Telefónica presented a binding offer to acquire the 56% that PRISA had in Canal+, in exchange for paying around €725 million. The following day, PRISA accepted the offer. In addition, it announced that &quot;for a period of thirty days&quot; since then, it would negotiate with Telefónica to continue with the purchase process, which would be regulated and analyzed by the CNMC and Brussels, so that there would be no monopoly or certain conditions would be established negative for competition. The closing of this sale is subject to obtaining the required authorization from the competition authorities and approval by a representative panel of PRISA&#x27;s financing banks.

On June 18, 2014, Telefónica presented a binding offer to acquire the shares of Mediaset España in Canal+ for €295 million, which represented 22% of the operator&#x27;s shareholding. On July 4, Mediaset España accepted the offer.

One year later, on April 22, 2015, the CNMC approved the sale of Canal+ to Telefónica. Canal+ began the merger process with Movistar TV on July 7, 2015. As a result, it changed its name to Movistar+, which was officially launched on the market on July 8. In this way, Prisa TV ceases to exist.

<doc id="656706" wikidata="Q1956921" url="?curid=656706" title="Mystic-class deep-submergence rescue vehicle">
<text>&quot;Mystic&quot; class is a class of Deep-Submergence Rescue Vehicles (DSRVs), designed for rescue operations on submerged, disabled submarines of the United States Navy or foreign navies. The two submarines of the class were never used for this purpose, and were replaced by the Submarine Rescue Diving Recompression System.

==Features==
DSRVs are designed for quick deployment in the event of a submarine accident. DSRVs are transportable by truck, aircraft, ship, or by specially configured attack submarine. At the accident site, the DSRV works with either a &quot;mother ship&quot; or &quot;mother submarine&quot;. The DSRV dives, conducts a sonar search, and attaches to the disabled submarine&#x27;s hatch. DSRVs can embark up to 24 persons for transfer to the mother vessel.

The DSRV also has an arm to clear hatches on a disabled submarine and a combined gripper and cable cutter. The gripper is able to lift 1,000 pounds (450 kg).

==Background==

The Deep Submergence System Project was established in June 1965 in the aftermath of the loss of USS &quot;Thresher&quot; in 1963.

At the time, submarine operating depths greatly exceeded the capabilities of rescue vessels. Lockheed Missiles and Space Company was contracted to produce a deep diving rescue submarine. In an effort to win the design and construction contracts for a DSRV, the company built &quot;Deep Quest&quot; prototype. She was launched in June 1967; in March 1970, she was used to find a US Navy Grumman F6F-3 Hellcat which had crashed on 12 January 1944, in the ocean near Naval Air Station San Diego.

The first DSRV was launched in 1970. While it has been alleged that the stated goal of the DSRV project was unrealistic, and that it was a front for research on undersea espionage, including cable tapping, the DSRVs have a demonstrated rescue capability, and have conducted numerous practice rescue missions.

DSRV-1 was launched in San Diego, California, on 24 January 1970. Testing culminated in an operational evaluation that saw a complete, simulated submarine rescue mission. DSRV-1 was named &quot;Mystic&quot; during Fleet Acceptance Ceremonies in 1977.

The second, and final, vessel in the class, DSRV-2, was subsequently launched and named &quot;Avalon&quot;.

<doc id="656708" wikidata="Q635169" url="?curid=656708" title="Caersws">
<text>Caersws (; ) is a village and community on the River Severn, in the Welsh county of Powys (Montgomeryshire) west of Newtown, and halfway between Aberystwyth and Shrewsbury. It has a station on the Cambrian Line from Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury. At the 2011 Census, the community had a population of 1,586 – a figure which includes the settlements of Clatter, Llanwnnog and Pontdolgoch. The village itself had a population of slightly over 800.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Welsh placename elements &quot;Caer-&quot; and &quot;Sŵs&quot;. &quot;Caer&quot; translates as &quot;fort&quot; and likely refers to the Roman settlement. The derivation of the second element is less certain.

Thomas Pennant and later writers note that the fort was the termination of the Roman Road from Chester (via Meifod), the name of the road was &quot;Sarn Swsan&quot; or &quot;Sarn Swsog&quot; and it is thought that the town and the road share their etymology. The meaning of Swsan/Swsog is again, uncertain, but two local traditions hold that this is a personal name, either of a Queen Swswen (a name which may translate as &quot;The Blessed/Pure Kiss&quot;) a Celtic leader who is said to have fought a battle in the vicinity around the time of the Roman occupation who was equated with Estrildis by Oliver Mathews, or it is named for a Roman lieutenant &quot;Hesus&quot;.

Furthermore, the linguist John Rhys noted that the dialect of Mid-Wales Welsh (Y Bowyseg) was closer to the Gaulish language than its neighbours, and concluded that the area had pre-Roman links to Gaul. This may suggest a link between Caersŵs and the God Esus venerated by the Parisii and Treverii.

Other suggested etymologies include the name retaining a Roman-era dedication to Zeus, and the fact that &quot;sws&quot; (not sŵs) can be literally translated to &quot;Kiss&quot; in modern Welsh has led to a number of developing folk etymologies.

==History==

Caersws was the location of two Roman forts of Roman Wales. Although the Mediolanum of the Antonine Itinerary has since been identified as Whitchurch in Shropshire, Caersws is sometimes identified as the Mediolanum among the Ordovices described in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, although others argue for Llanfyllin or Meifod. Further, this second Mediolanum may be identical or distinct from the &quot;Mediomanum&quot; ( &quot;Central Hand&quot;) mentioned by the Ravenna Cosmography.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes the community of Carno and at the 2011 Census had a population of 2,316.

==Buildings==
The Church of St Gwynog dates from the 15th century and was restored in 1863. It contains a 15th century rood screen and loft which the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales describes as &quot;exceptional; the best-preserved of thirty known to have existed in the county&quot;. Maesmawr Hall, to the south-east of the village, was built in the early 19th century and is a Grade II* listed building.

==Sport==
Downhill Mountain Biking has flourished in forestry at Henblas farm, to the north of the village, with a number of national races being held there. The current series - The Caersws Cup - began in March 2009.

Cymru Alliance club Caersws F.C. are based in the village, and play their home matches at the Recreation Ground.

Caersws is home to current and past champions of a number of sporting disciplines, leading some to christen it the &quot;Sporting Capital of Wales&quot;.

<text>Benjamin Smith Barton (February10, 1766December19, 1815) was an American botanist, naturalist, and physician. He was one of the first professors of natural history in the United States and built the largest collection of botanical specimens in the country. He wrote the first American textbook on botany.

==Early life==
Barton&#x27;s father, Rev. Thomas Barton, was an Irish immigrant from Carrickmacross who opened a school near Norristown, Pennsylvania, in 1751. His mother was Esther Rittenhouse, sister of astronomer David Rittenhouse.

Between 1780 and 1782, Barton studied at York Academy in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he showed an aptitude for drawing and an interest in collecting natural history specimens. Two years later, he attended the College of Philadelphia School of Medicine, studied medicine under Thomas Shippen, and attended Benjamin Rush&#x27;s lectures in 1785. Young Barton also accompanied his uncle, David Rittenhouse, who had been commissioned to survey the western boundary of Pennsylvania in 1785. His travels aroused a lifelong interest in Native Americans. In 1786, Barton transferred to the University of Edinburgh, where he studied for two years before leaving without a degree because of financial difficulties and disagreements with two professors. 

After leaving Edinburgh it is not clear whether Barton then studied at the University of Göttingen. He never contradicted a public perception that he earned a medical degree at Göttingen but no such records exist. However, he did receive a diploma from the Lisbon Academy in Portugal and was ultimately awarded an honorary degree from the University of Kiel.

==Medical career==
Returning to Philadelphia in 1789, Barton practiced medicine. In 1790, he was elected to a fellowship at Philadelphia&#x27;s College of Physicians. The same year, he succeeded Adam Kuhn as professor of Natural History and Botany at the College of Philadelphia. The College and its medical school merged with the University of Pennsylvania the following year. Two years later, Barton was also elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In early 1796, Barton succeeded Samuel Powel Griffitts, and became Professor of Materia Medica. Embarrassed by his lack of credentials, Barton purchased a degree of Doctor of Medicine from the Christian-Albrechts University at Kiel in August 1796. In 1813, Barton succeeded to the professorship of the Theory and Practice of Medicine after the death of Rush but continued to lecture in natural history and botany. Concurrently with his academic position, he served as a physician at Pennsylvania Hospital from 1798 to his death, in 1815.

==Works==

Barton corresponded with naturalists throughout the United States and Europe, and he made significant contributions to the scientific literature of his day. In 1803, Barton published &quot;Elements of botany, or Outlines of the natural history of vegetables&quot;, the first American textbook on botany. Barton&#x27;s work in natural history and botany was often assisted by William Bartram, the traveler, botanist, and artist. Bartram provided the illustrations of North American plants for Barton&#x27;s 1803 &quot;Elements of Botany&quot;. From 1798 to 1804, Barton published a work on medicinal plants, &quot;Collections for An Essay Towards a Materia Medica of the United-States&quot;. From 1802 to 1805 Barton edited the &quot;Philadelphia Medical and Physical Journal,&quot; and in 1803, Barton founded the short-lived American Linnaean Society of Philadelphia.

Barton was also interested in anatomy and zoology, and in 1796, he published his &quot;Memoir Concerning the Fascinating Faculty Which Has been Ascribed to the Rattle-Snake&quot;. In 1803, he published a comparative study of linguistics, &quot;Etymology of Certain English Words and on Their Affinity to Words in the Languages of Different European, Asiatic and American (Indian) Nations&quot;, and a text on the origin of the first American people, &quot;New Views of the Origin of the Tribes and Nations of America&quot; (1797).

He was the editor of the &quot;Philadelphia Medical and Physical Journal&quot; (1805–1808), one of the oldest scientific publications in the United States.

Barton was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. The Society holds among its collections a number of Barton&#x27;s publications as well as a complete run of the &quot;Philadelphia Medical and Physical Journal&quot;

==Archeology==
Barton pursued archeology. Although his early publication in 1787, &quot;Observations on Some Parts of Natural History,&quot; incorrectly attributed the prehistoric mounds of Ohio to the Danes, by his 1797 work (mentioned above), he had reconsidered his earlier claim and identified the Mound builders correctly as Native Americans. While he was not the first to make such a claim, he may have been the first to suggest a significant age to the mounds, as he posited that they were older than James Ussher&#x27;s Biblical chronology. Lacking evidence, Barton still speculated that Native Americans originated in Asia, anticipating the much later scientific consensus in favor of the idea.

==Appointments==
Barton was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1789. He served as president of the Philadelphia Medical Society from 1808 to 1815. In 1812, he was elected as a member to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Miscellaneous==
In 1803, before his famous expedition, Meriwether Lewis went to Philadelphia and met with Benjamin Smith Barton. Barton helped to increase Lewis&#x27; botanical knowledge and collection skills. Lewis returned with 226 plants. They are preserved today at the Lewis and Clark Herbarium at the Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia.

==Death==
In 1815, Barton died of tuberculosis in New York City.

==Legacy==

His older brother, William Barton, was also a member of the American Philosophical Society. His maternal uncle, David Rittenhouse, served as the Society&#x27;s second president after the death of founder Benjamin Franklin in 1790.

His son Thomas Pennant Barton (born in Philadelphia in 1803; died there April 5, 1869) gathered together a notable Shakespearean library. It comprised 2,000 of the rarest editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, and formed, with about 10,000 miscellaneous books, one of the most important private collections in America. He provided by will that this should be sold after his death to some institution that could prevent its dispersion. His widow carried out his wishes, and the collection was acquired by the Boston Public Library, which set apart a special room for its accommodation. A catalogue was issued, prefaced by a memoir.

<text>Beta Pictoris (abbreviated β Pictoris or β Pic) is the second brightest star in the constellation Pictor. It is located from the Solar System, and is 1.75 times as massive and 8.7 times as luminous as the Sun. The Beta Pictoris system is very young, only 20 to 26 million years old, although it is already in the main sequence stage of its evolution. Beta Pictoris is the title member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, an association of young stars which share the same motion through space and have the same age.

The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has confirmed the presence of two planets, Beta Pictoris b, and Beta Pictoris c, through the use of direct imagery. Both planets are orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star. Beta Pictoris c is currently the closest extrasolar planet to its star ever photographed: the observed separation is roughly the same as the distance between the asteroid belt and the Sun.

Beta Pictoris shows an excess of infrared emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, which was the first debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.

==Location and visibility==
Beta Pictoris is a star in the southern constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located to the west of the bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.

The distance to Beta Pictoris and many other stars was measured by the Hipparcos satellite. This was done by measuring its trigonometric parallax: the slight displacement in its position observed as the Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87 milliarcseconds, a value which was later revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when the data was reanalyzed taking systematic errors more carefully into account. The distance to Beta Pictoris is therefore 63.4 light years, with an uncertainty of 0.1 light years.

The Hipparcos satellite also measured the proper motion of Beta Pictoris: it is traveling eastwards at a rate of 4.65 milliarcseconds per year, and northwards at a rate of 83.10 milliarcseconds per year. Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star&#x27;s spectrum reveals it is moving away from Earth at a rate of 20 km/s. Several other stars share the same motion through space as Beta Pictoris and likely formed from the same gas cloud at roughly the same time: these comprise the Beta Pictoris moving group.

==Physical properties==

===Spectrum, luminosity and variability===
According to measurements made as part of the Nearby Stars Project, Beta Pictoris has a spectral type of A6V and has an effective temperature of , which is hotter than the Sun&#x27;s . Analysis of the spectrum reveals that the star contains a slightly higher ratio of heavy elements, which are termed metals in astronomy, to hydrogen than the Sun. This value is expressed as the quantity [M/H], the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the star&#x27;s metal fraction to that of the Sun. In the case of Beta Pictoris, the value of [M/H] is 0.05, which means that the star&#x27;s metal fraction is 12% greater than that of the Sun.

Analysis of the spectrum can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has log g=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is about half of the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Sun (274 m/s²).

As an A-type main sequence star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with the distance of 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.4, as compared to the Sun, which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.

Many main sequence stars of spectral type A fall into a region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.

===Mass, radius and rotation===
The mass of Beta Pictoris has been determined by using models of stellar evolution and fitting them to the star&#x27;s observed properties. This method yields a stellar mass between 1.7 and 1.8 solar masses. The star&#x27;s angular diameter has been measured using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope and was found to be 0.84 milliarcseconds, giving it an actual size 1.7 times that of the Sun.

The rotational velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured to be at least 130 km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true rotational velocity: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star&#x27;s axis of rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).

===Age and formation===

The presence of significant amounts of dust around the star implies a young age of the system and led to debate about whether it had joined the main sequence or was still a pre–main sequence star However, when the star&#x27;s distance was measured by Hipparcos it was revealed that Beta Pictoris was located further away than previously thought and hence was more luminous than originally believed. Once the Hipparcos results were taken into account, it was found that Beta Pictoris was located close to the zero age main sequence and was not a pre–main sequence star after all. Analysis of Beta Pictoris and other stars within the Beta Pictoris moving group suggested that they are around 12 million years old. However more recent studies indicate that the age is roughly double this at 20 to 26 million years old.

Beta Pictoris may have been formed near the Scorpius–Centaurus association. The collapse of the gas cloud which resulted in the formation of Beta Pictoris may have been triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HD 83058, which is now a runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests that it would have been in the vicinity of the Scorpius–Centaurus association about 13 million years ago. However, HD 83058 has been found to be a spectroscopic binary and unlikely to have been ejected by the supernova explosion of a close companion, so the simple explanation for the origin of the Beta Pictoris cluster is in doubt.

==Circumstellar environment==
===Debris disks===

Excess infrared radiation from Beta Pictoris was detected by the IRAS spacecraft in 1983. Along with Vega, Fomalhaut and Epsilon Eridani, it was one of the first four stars from which such an excess was detected: these stars are called &quot;Vega-like&quot; after the first such star discovered. Since A-type stars like Beta Pictoris tend to radiate most of their energy at the blue end of the spectrum, this implied the presence of cool matter in orbit around the star, which would radiate at infrared wavelengths and produce the excess. This hypothesis was verified in 1984 when Beta Pictoris became the first star to have its circumstellar disk imaged optically. The IRAS data are (at the micron wavelengths): [12]=2.68, [25]=0.05, [60]=−2.74 and [100]=−3.41. The colour excesses are: E12=0.69, E25=3.35, E60=6.17 and E100=6.90.

The debris disk around Beta Pictoris is seen edge-on by observers on Earth, and is orientated in a northeast-southwest direction. The disk is asymmetric: in the northeast direction it has been observed out to 1835 astronomical units from the star, while the southwest direction the extent is 1450 AU. The disk is rotating: the part to the northeast of the star is moving away from Earth, while the part to the southwest of the disc is moving towards Earth.

Several elliptical rings of material have been observed in the outer regions of the debris disk between 500 and 800 AU: these may have formed as a result of the system being disrupted by a passing star. Astrometric data from the Hipparcos mission reveal that the red giant star Beta Columbae passed within 2 light years of Beta Pictoris about 110,000 years ago, but a larger perturbation would have been caused by Zeta Doradus, which passed at a distance of 3 light years about 350,000 years ago. However computer simulations favor a lower encounter velocity than either of these two candidates, which suggest that the star responsible for the rings may have been a companion star of Beta Pictoris on an unstable orbit. The simulations suggest a perturbing star with a mass of 0.5 solar masses is likely to blame for the structures. Such a star would be a red dwarf of spectral type M0V.
In 2006, imaging of the system with the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s Advanced Camera for Surveys revealed the presence of a secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.

Studies made with the NASA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer have discovered that the disk around Beta Pictoris contains an extreme overabundance of carbon-rich gas. This helps stabilize the disk against radiation pressure which would otherwise blow the material away into interstellar space. Currently, there are two suggested explanations for the origin of the carbon overabundance. Beta Pictoris might be in the process of forming exotic carbon-rich planets, in contrast to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which are rich in oxygen instead of carbon. Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that might also have occurred early in the development of the Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich meteorites known as enstatite chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment. It has also been proposed that Jupiter may have formed around a carbon-rich core.

In 2011 the disk around Beta Pictoris became the first other planetary system to be photographed by an amateur astronomer. Rolf Olsen of New Zealand captured the disk with a 10-inch Newtonian reflector and a modified webcam.

===Planetesimal belts===
In 2003, imaging of the inner region of the Beta Pictoris system with the Keck II telescope revealed the presence of several features which are interpreted as being belts or rings of material. Belts at approximately 14, 28, 52 and 82 astronomical units from the star were detected, which alternate in inclination with respect to the main disk.

Observations in 2004 revealed the presence of an inner belt containing silicate material at a distance of 6.4 AU from the star. Silicate material was also detected at 16 and 30 AU from the star, with a lack of dust between 6.4 and 16 AU providing evidence that a massive planet may be orbiting in this region. Magnesium-rich olivine has also been detected, strikingly similar to that found in the Solar System comets and different from the olivine found in Solar System asteroids. Olivine crystals can only form closer than 10 AU from the star; therefore they have been transported to the belt after formation, probably by radial mixing.

Modeling of the dust disk at 100 AU from the star suggests the dust in this region may have been produced by a series of collisions initiated by the destruction of planetesimals with radii of about 180 kilometers. After the initial collision, the debris undergoes further collisions in a process called a collisional cascade. Similar processes have been inferred in the debris disks around Fomalhaut and AU Microscopii.

Two giant collisions are thought to have taken place in the past around Beta Pictoris. The first suspected collision occurred around 150 years ago and involved a mass between 1019 to 1021 kg, which translates to a body with a size between 100 and 500 km. This collision occurred around 85 au from the host star. This first collision could explain the so-called cat&#x27;s tail seen only in JWST images of the debris disk. Comparisons were made between Spitzer observations (2004-2005) and JWST observations (2023). This showed that the 600 Kelvin hot dust continuum, as well as a forsterite signature disappeared. This was interpreted as another collision that occurred a few years before 2004. The dust produced in the collision was blown out by radiation pressure from the star in the years between 2005 and 2023.

===Falling evaporating bodies===
The spectrum of Beta Pictoris shows strong short-term variability that was first noticed in the red-shifted part of various absorption lines, which was interpreted as being caused by material falling onto the star. The source of this material was suggested to be small comet-like objects on orbits which take them close to the star where they begin to evaporate, termed the &quot;falling evaporating bodies&quot; model. Transient blue-shifted absorption events were also detected, though less frequently: these may represent a second group of objects on a different set of orbits. Detailed modeling indicates the falling evaporating bodies are unlikely to be mainly icy like comets, but instead are probably composed of a mixed dust and ice core with a crust of refractory material. These objects may have been perturbed onto their star-grazing orbits by the gravitational influence of a planet in a mildly eccentric orbit around Beta Pictoris at a distance of roughly 10 AU from the star. Falling evaporating bodies may also be responsible for the presence of gas located high above the plane of the main debris disk. A study from 2019 reported transiting exocomets with TESS. The dips are asymmetric in nature and are consistent with models of evaporating comets crossing the disc of the star. The comets are in a highly eccentric orbit and are non-periodic.

===Planetary system===
On November 21, 2008, it was announced that infrared observations made in 2003 with the Very Large Telescope had revealed a candidate planetary companion to the star. In the autumn of 2009 the planet was successfully observed on the other side of the parent star, confirming the existence of the planet itself and earlier observations. It is believed that in 15 years () it will be possible to record the whole orbit of the planet.

The European Southern Observatory confirmed the presence of Beta Pictoris c, on 6 October 2020, through the use of direct imagery. Beta Pictoris c is orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star. Beta Pictoris c is currently the closest extrasolar planet to its star ever photographed: the observed separation is roughly the same as the distance between the asteroid belt and the Sun.



The radial velocity method is not well suited to study A-type stars like Beta Pictoris. The very young age of the star makes the noise even worse. Current limits derived from this method are enough to rule out hot Jupiter-type planets more massive than 2 Jupiter masses at a distance of less than from the star. For planets orbiting at , planets with less than 9 Jupiter masses would have evaded detection. Therefore, to find planets in the Beta Pictoris system, astronomers look for the effects that the planet has on the circumstellar environment.
Multiple lines of evidence suggested the existence of a massive planet orbiting in the region around from the star: the dust-free gap between the planetesimal belts at and suggest this region is being cleared out; a planet at this distance would explain the origin of the falling evaporating bodies, and the warps and inclined rings in the inner disk suggest a massive planet on an inclined orbit is disrupting the disk.

The observed planet by itself cannot explain the structure of the planetesimal belts at and from the star. These belts might be associated with smaller planets at , with around respectively. Such a system of planets, if it exists, would be close to a 1:3:7 orbital resonance. It may also be that the rings in the outer disc at are indirectly caused by the influence of these planets.

The object was observed at an angular distance of from Beta Pictoris, which corresponds to a distance in the plane of the sky of . For comparison, the orbital radii of the planets Jupiter and Saturn are and respectively. The separation in the radial direction is unknown, so this is a lower limit on the true separation. Estimates of its mass depend on theoretical models of planetary evolution, and predict the object has about 8 Jupiter masses and is still cooling, with a temperature ranging from . These figures come with the caveat that the models have not yet been tested against real data in the likely ranges of mass and age for the planet.

The semimajor axis is and its orbital period is . A &quot;transit-like event&quot; was observed in November 1981; this is consistent with those estimates. If this is confirmed as a true transit, the inferred radius of the transiting object is , which is larger than predicted by theoretical models. This may indicate that it is surrounded by a large ring system or a moon-forming disc.

Confirmation of a second planet in the Beta Pictoris system was announced on 6 October 2020. The planet has a temperature of , a dynamical mass of , and an age of . It has an orbital period of about and a semimajor axis of , about 3.5 times closer to its parent star than Beta Pictoris b. The orbit of Beta Pictoris c is moderately eccentric, with an eccentricity of 0.24.

This planet presents data with conflict with current, as of 2020, models for planetary formation. β Pic c is at an age where planetary formations is predicted to occur via disk instability. However the planet orbits at a distance of , which prediction says is too close for disk instability to occur. The low apparent magnitude, of , suggests that it formed via core accretion.

Existence of an additional smaller planet on a wider orbit, close to the inner edge of the disk, has been proposed to explain the observed inner debris disk edge at , which does not match the dynamical simulation results for the two-planet model. A planet of mass in the range of on a low-eccentricity orbit between would remain below the observational limit for direct observation, but can reproduce the observed disk profile in simulation.

==Dust stream==
In 2000, observations made with the Advanced Meteor Orbit Radar facility in New Zealand revealed the presence of a stream of particles coming from the direction of Beta Pictoris, which may be a dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System. The particles in the Beta Pictoris dust stream are relatively large, with radii exceeding 20 micrometers, and their velocities suggest that they must have left the Beta Pictoris system at roughly 25 km/s. These particles may have been ejected from the Beta Pictoris debris disk as a result of the migration of gas giant planets within the disk and may be an indication that the Beta Pictoris system is forming an Oort cloud. Numerical modeling of dust ejection indicates radiation pressure may also be responsible and suggests that planets further than about 1 AU from the star cannot directly cause the dust stream.

<text>Lester Paul Straker Bolnalda (born October 10, 1959) is a former professional baseball right-handed starting pitcher. He played two seasons for the Minnesota Twins in 1987-88. Straker is currently the pitching coach for the DSL Phillies.

==Career==
A ten-year minor leaguer, Straker went all the way to the 1987 World Series in his rookie year. As a young prospect, Straker was released by the Cincinnati Reds and Oakland Athletics. He made his major league debut with the Twins as their number-three starter behind Frank Viola and Bert Blyleven.

Straker became the first Venezuelan to pitch in the World Series when he started games three and six. He began 1988 on the disabled list and never completely recovered his form, being released when the season was over. He played two additional seasons in the minor leagues.

In his two-season, 47-game career, Straker had a record of 10–15, with 99 strikeouts, one shutout, one save, and a 4.22 earned run average.

===Coaching===
Straker was named as the pitching coach for the DSL Phillies for the 2018 season.

==Features==

Yardley&#x27;s main shopping area is known as Yew Tree, named after a 1919 public house, The Yew Tree, that was demolished in 2000 to make way for the shopping centre. Prior to the building of the public house, this was the site of the 19th century Yardley House, presumably incorporating a yew tree.

The Swan public house run by Ansells Brewery was, for a time, the largest in Great Britain with eight bars and a total drinking area of almost 14,000 square feet serving over 1,000 customers.

In 2012, the Swan Shopping Centre was opened in the area serving the Yardley area in the place of the old Swan Centre which used to hold markets.

==History==

===Parish of Yardley===
Yardley is not a town. The ancient parish of Yardley included the areas known as Stechford and Hall Green. Yardley is named in the Domesday Book and was referred to as early as 972 in King Edgar&#x27;s Charter where it is named Gyrdleah. It was mentioned as being under the possession of Pershore Abbey.
Yardley also contains a moated medieval site called &quot;Kent&#x27;s Moat&quot;. Now dry, it has retained its depth and shape remarkably well considering its age, as excavations have shown evidence of inhabitation from as early as the 12th century.

Yardley has a Tudor hall called Blakesley Hall and an old church, St Edburgha&#x27;s, that dates back to the 13th century, with the church tower and spire dating to the 15th century. It was not established by the abbey, but by Aston Church in the Diocese of Lichfield. A Tudor addition to the church is a doorway surrounded by Tudor roses and a pomegranate, commemorating the marriage of Prince Arthur, Prince of Wales, to Catherine of Aragon.

Yardley had a manor that was owned by various lords. It remained unoccupied from 1700 onwards. It was owned by the Royal Family until 1626, when it was bought by Richard Grevis of Moseley Hall. His descendants sold it in 1759 to pay off debts. John Taylor, one of the founders of Lloyds Bank, bought the lordship in 1766. Most of the land, had by then, been purchased by other people so Taylor owned only a small portion of the original grounds.

In 1911 the civil parish had a population of 59,165. On 1 April 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham.

===Yardley Rural District===
Yardley Rural District was a local government administrative district formed from the parish of Yardley, historically part of Worcestershire under the Local Government Act 1894. The Rural District included the wards of Yardley Wood. Yardley Council House was originally erected to house the Rural District Council (Yardley RDC).

By 1911 Yardley was a residential suburb of Birmingham and was annexed to Birmingham and Warwickshire under the 1911 Greater Birmingham Act. Birmingham&#x27;s Worcestershire heritage can be seen at Acocks Green police station where the building is decorated with a &quot;three pears&quot; motif from the Worcestershire coat of arms.

A small section of Yardley, called Old Yardley, was granted conservation area status in 1969, becoming Birmingham&#x27;s first conservation area.

In 1981, an Arcon V prefab home on Moat Lane was dismantled and transported to Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings.

==Education==

Yardley has five main primary schools. These are Yardley, Blakesley Hall, Lyndon Green, Oasis Academy Hobmoor and St. Bernedettes. It also has two main secondary schools, which are Cockshut Hill School and King Edward VI Sheldon Heath Academy.

Hobmoor Primary School moved to new premises in Summer 2007. The former building has been demolished and the site remains vacant to be redeveloped.

==Transport==
Yardley&#x27;s nearest railway station is Stechford railway station. It is served by National Express West Midlands bus routes 11A, 11C, 17, 58, 60, 73, X1 and X2, connecting to Birmingham city centre, outer circle, Chelmsley Wood and Solihull and Claribel Coaches route S16.

The area used to be well-served by horse-buses and then by steam buses. Electric trams were then introduced and they travelled across a new bridge at the River Cole to the Swan.

<text>Hall Green is an area in southeast Birmingham, England, synonymous with the B28 postcode. It is also a council constituency of Birmingham City Council, managed by its own district committee. Historically it lay within the county of Worcestershire. The 2001 Population Census found that there were 25,921 people living in Hall Green with a population density of 4,867 people per km2, this compares with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham.

The Shire Country Park runs past Sarehole Mill and along the course of the River Cole to Small Heath. Millstream Way passes through the park. Wildlife present at the country park include otters and water voles and many types of birds. The old village of Sarehole (now on the border of Hall Green and Moseley) is where J. R. R. Tolkien lived as a child and gained inspiration for the Hobbit&#x27;s home &quot;The Shire&quot; as well as the book, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Hall Green was the home to Moor Green F.C., prior to an arson attack on the club&#x27;s original Moorlands stadium in 2005, leading to the club moving their home games to Solihull Borough&#x27;s Damson Park stadium, with the two clubs subsequently merging to become Solihull Moors. The local Moorlands stadium has since been demolished to make way for &#x27;The Moorlands&#x27; housing estate.

Hall Green was also the home to the popular greyhound racing stadium and race course situated on the former Olympia Sports Ground, York Road called Hall Green Stadium; the stadium having won the BGRB Midlands and Western Region Racecourse of the Year for four consecutive years between 2000 and 2003. The stadium was closed by its owners Euro Property Investments Limited in July 2017 to make way for the &#x27;Olympia&#x27; housing estate.

==History==

On School Road is the Church of the Ascension, formerly the Job Marston Chapel, which was built in 1704 and is believed to have been designed by Sir William Wilson. The chancel and transepts were added in 1860. The brick building consists of an exterior with a stone entablature and balustrade supported by Doric pilasters and the window architraves are of moulded stone. At the west end is a tower with an octagonal upper storey with a copper cupola. The interior of the nave is covered by a coved plaster ceiling. It is the earliest classical church to survive within the city boundary.
Other historic buildings in Hall Green include Sarehole Mill, one of only two watermills in the city.

Highfield House was another historical building. It was built in 1850, making it the oldest house and the third oldest building in Hall Green. It was the farm house for Highfield Farm. The house was built in Georgian style with Neo-Classical features. It also retained the original sash windows. In March 2008, in the face of much public opposition, petitions, articles in local newspapers and items on radio stations, Birmingham City Council&#x27;s Planning Committee approved plans for its demolition and the building of four houses and six apartments.
A private development named &quot;The Hamlet&quot; was built between 1883 and 1893. It consists of fourteen villas on Hamlet and Fox Hollies Roads, along with the Friends Meeting House on the Stratford Road. The architectural style of these brick and tile properties is typified by massive chimneys and timbers, leaded casements, and bracketed bays. It is believed that initially all the properties carried a moulded plaque bearing the initials &#x27;MS&#x27; along with the date of construction but few of these plaques now remain. Whilst there is not a definite explanation for the &#x27;MS&#x27; monogram, the most likely interpretation is that they stand for Marian Severne whose families land they were built on.

Petersfield Court, an Art Deco housing block containing 14 flats, was built in 1937. Built out of brick, it has rounded corner windows, made possible by the introduction of reinforced concrete. Later examples of architecture include the original Hall Green Technical College on the Stratford Road. It was designed by S. T. Walker and Partners in association with Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, the City architect for Birmingham. Built in 1958, it consists of a reinforced concrete framed classroom and an administration block clad with cedar boards and aluminium windows. Boarding was rarely used on educational buildings of this size at the time.

Otherwise, housing is largely inter-war. There are still a small number of independent locally run shops.

==Politics==
Hall Green is part of the parliamentary constituency of Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley, which also includes the wards of Moseley and Kings Heath, Sparkbrook and Springfield; the Member of Parliament for the constituency is Tahir Ali, of the Labour Party.

==Education==
Primary schools in Hall Green include Chilcote Primary School, Hall Green Infant School, Hall Green Junior School, Lakey Lane Primary School, St Ambrose Barlow RC Primary School, Robin Hood Academy and Yorkmead School. Rosslyn School is a private primary school located in the area.

==Transport==
Hall Green railway station is on the Birmingham to Stratford Line with some services also running between Kidderminster &amp; Worcester Foregate Street and Stratford-Upon-Avon &amp; Whitlocks End. It opened in 1908 and is currently operated by West Midlands Railway. National Express West Midlands and Diamond Bus operate a number of bus routes through the area, terminating in, Acocks Green, Digbeth, Erdington, Lyndon, Northfield, Perry Barr, Shirley, and Solihull.

==Famous residents==
Hall Green has been a home to comedian Tony Hancock, who lived at 41 Southam Road until the age of three (the house contains a plaque commemorating this), racing commentator Murray Walker, who was born at 214 Reddings Lane (which is now a dentist&#x27;s surgery), 1992 Formula One world champion Nigel Mansell, who though born in Upton-upon-Severn spent most of his childhood and early adult years in the area, comedian Joe Lycett who is believed to have later settled in Kings Heath in his own residence, actor and writer Christopher Smith, former British number one tennis player Daniel Evans, TV personality Alison Hammond and most famously J. R. R. Tolkien, who lived near Sarehole Mill, Birmingham&#x27;s only working water mill.

Sarehole Mill is a tourist attraction, powered by a tributary of the River Cole, that is open to visitors during the summer months and has several locations nearby that are the inspiration behind scenes in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<text>Alexander Melchor Pacheco Lara (born July 19, 1973) is a former pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Montreal Expos in its 1996 season. Listed at 6&#x27; 3&quot; , 200 lb. , Pacheco batted and threw right handed. He was born in Caracas, Venezuela.

==Career==
The Expos signed Pacheco as an amateur free agent in 1989. Pacheco made his debut with the Gulf Coast League Expos in 1990, spending six seasons in the Montreal Minor League system, where he was mostly used as a long reliever and spot starter, until he joined the big team in April 1996. In five relief appearances for the Expos, Pacheco posted an 11.12 ERA and did not have a decision or save, giving up seven earned runs on eight hits and one walk while striking out seven in innings of work.

Pacheco spent the remainder of the 1996 season with the Harrisburg Senators. Late in the year, he was sent along with Jeff Fassero to the Seattle Mariners for Trey Moore, Matt Wagner and Chris Widger. Pacheco spent 1997 in the Mariners&#x27; organization, and later pitched for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and New York Yankees Triple A teams in a span of three seasons from 1998 to 2002.

In between, Pacheco played winter ball for four clubs of the Venezuelan League during 13 seasons between 1989 and 2002, as well as for the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League in 2000 and 2002–2003.

Overall, Pacheco had a 50–54 record with a 4.34 ERA and 55 saves at six different levels, along with 649 strikeouts and 348 walks in innings.

After his playing retirement, Pacheco became a coach in the Venezuelan League.

<doc id="656740" wikidata="Q24314" url="?curid=656740" title="Born Again (Black Sabbath album)">
<text>Born Again is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath. Released on 9 September 1983, it is the only album the group recorded with lead vocalist Ian Gillan, then-formerly of Deep Purple. It was also the last Black Sabbath album for 9 years to feature original bassist Geezer Butler and the last to feature original drummer Bill Ward, though Ward did record one studio track with the band 15 years later on their 1998 live album &quot;Reunion&quot;. The album has received mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success upon its 1983 release, reaching No. 4 in the UK charts. The album also hit the top 40 in the United States. In July 2021, guitarist and founding member Tony Iommi confirmed that the long-lost original master tapes of the album had been finally located, and that he was considering remixing the album for a future re-release.

==Origins==
Following the departure of vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice in 1982, Sabbath&#x27;s future was in doubt. The band switched management to Don Arden (Sharon Osbourne&#x27;s father) and he suggested Ian Gillan as the new vocalist. The band had considered vocalists such as Robert Plant and David Coverdale before settling on Gillan. With Whitesnake on the verge of breaking up, Iommi was eager to form a new group with Coverdale and drummer Cozy Powell joining him and Butler, but Coverdale and Powell decided at the last minute to continue with Whitesnake (the latter would eventually join Black Sabbath in 1988). While Iommi has claimed that the band received an audition tape from a then-unknown Michael Bolton at this time, Butler claims no such thing happened and that Iommi concocted the story as &quot;a joke&quot;. This claim has also been refuted by Bolton himself, who clarified that it was &quot;only a rumour&quot;.

Iommi told &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine in late 1983 that Gillan was the best candidate, saying &quot;His shriek is legendary.&quot; Gillan was at first reluctant, but his manager convinced him to meet with Iommi and Butler at The Bear, a pub in Oxford. After a night of heavy drinking, Gillan officially committed to the project in February 1983. The following morning Gillan had no memory of joining the band and claimed he didn&#x27;t even like Black Sabbath&#x27;s music, but the deal had already been struck.

The project was originally intended to be a new supergroup, and the members of the group had no intention of billing themselves as Black Sabbath. At some point after recording had been completed, Arden insisted that they use the recognizable Sabbath name, and the members were overruled. Arden had secured a sizable advance from the record company with the proviso that Gillan be involved, and they would only release the album under the Black Sabbath name. &quot;We thought we were doing a kind of Gillan-Iommi-Butler-Ward album…&quot; recalled bassist Geezer Butler. &quot;That is the way we approached the album. When we had finished the album, we took it to the record company and they said, &#x27;Well, here&#x27;s the contract: it is going to go out as a Black Sabbath album.&quot;

With Cozy Powell electing to remain with Coverdale in Whitesnake, Black Sabbath&#x27;s longtime drummer Bill Ward was persuaded to return to the band. Ward claimed to be newly sober after leaving the band in 1980 to deal with his alcoholism and he assured Iommi and Butler that he was up to recording and touring once again. Ward began drinking at some point during the sessions and returned to Los Angeles for treatment once the album was completed, and has remained sober ever since. Ward has said that he enjoyed making the album, which remains his final studio album with the band.

==Recording==
Sabbath began recording in May 1983 at Richard Branson&#x27;s Manor Studio, in the Oxfordshire countryside. Engineer Robin Black had worked with the band in the mid-1970s on &quot;Sabotage&quot; and received a co-producer credit on &quot;Born Again&quot;.

During recording, the band members lived at Manor Studio while Gillan chose to live outside the house, alone, in a marquee tent on the studio grounds: &quot;I thought he was joking, but when I arrived at the Manor I saw this marquee outside and I thought, fucking hell, he&#x27;s serious. Ian had put up this big, huge tent. It had a cooking area and a bedroom and whatever else&quot;, said Iommi. Butler said that the tent situation and Gillan&#x27;s refusal to live with his new bandmates, in hindsight, likely indicated that the vocalist didn&#x27;t view himself as a member of the band.

&quot;Ian&#x27;s lyrics were about sexual things or true facts, even about stuff that happened at The Manor there and then,&quot; Iommi said. &quot;They were good, but quite a departure from Geezer&#x27;s and Ronnie&#x27;s lyrics.&quot; For example, Gillan returned from a local pub one evening, took a car belonging to drummer Ward, and commenced racing around a go-cart track on the Manor Studio property. He crashed the car, which burst into flames after he escaped uninjured. He wrote the album&#x27;s opening &quot;Trashed&quot; about the experience. Butler felt that Gillan&#x27;s lyrics on tracks such as &quot;Digital Bitch&quot; and &quot;Keep It Warm&quot; were good, but much better suited to the musical style of Deep Purple than Black Sabbath.

&quot;Disturbing the Priest&quot; was written after a rehearsal space – set up by Iommi in a small building near a local church – received noise complaints from the resident priests. &quot;We wanted this effect on &#x27;Disturbing the Priest&#x27;,&quot; recalled the guitarist, &quot;and Bill got this big bucket of water and he got this anvil. It was really heavy, and he&#x27;d got it hanging on a piece of rope and lower it in to get this effect: hit it and lower it in, and then lift it out again. It was a great effect, but it took hours to do.&quot;

The band got along well, but it became apparent to all involved that Gillan&#x27;s style did not quite mesh with the Sabbath sound. In 1992, he told director Martin Baker, &quot;I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had. It was totally, totally incompatible with any music they&#x27;d ever done. I didn&#x27;t wear leathers, I wasn&#x27;t of that image...I think the fans probably were in a total state of confusion.&quot; In 1992, Iommi admitted to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;Ian is a great singer, but he&#x27;s from a completely different background, and it was difficult for him to come in and sing Sabbath material.&quot;

&quot;I saw Ian go into the studio one day,&quot; Ward recalled, &quot;and I was fortunate and honoured, actually, to be part of a session. I watched him lay tracks on &#x27;Keep It Warm&#x27;… I felt like Ian &quot;was&quot; Ian in that song… I watched this incredible transformation of this man that really, I felt, delicately put lyrics together. It made sense. I thought he did an excellent job. And I really dig that song too.&quot;

&quot;I did some of the best drum work on that album…&quot; Bill Ward recalled. &quot;On &#x27;Disturbing the Priest&#x27;, there were some polyrhythms and some counterpoint things that I was doing, and I was using at least twenty different pieces of percussion towards the end of that song… I was real proud of a lot of the work that I did. Some of it invariably got lost in the mix, but I know that it&#x27;s printed on those tracks.&quot; Butler said that Ward began acting quite strangely during recording and was angrier than he had ever seen him. At one point the drummer began hallucinating and had to be hospitalized, and while he was there the band discovered his secret stash of vodka that he&#x27;d been consuming in secret at night. After being released from the hospital, Ward quit the band again and returned to America to sort out his issues, with his drum parts already recorded.

When the band heard the final product, they were horrified at the muffled mix. In his autobiography, Iommi explains that Gillan inadvertently blew a couple of tweeters in the studio speakers by playing the backing tracks too loud and nobody noticed. &quot;We just thought it was a bit of a funny sound, but it went very wrong somewhere between the mix and the mastering and the pressing of that album...the sound was really dull and muffly. I didn&#x27;t know about it, because we were already out on tour in Europe. By the time we heard the album, it was out and in the charts, but the sound was awful.&quot; Butler recalled listening to the tapes in his hotel room and being alarmed at how &quot;muffled and unclear&quot; the tracks were, but Iommi and Black assured him that the issue would be corrected during mixing. Ultimately, the issue never was corrected, with Butler lamenting years later that &quot;that&#x27;s what happens when you don&#x27;t hire a bona fide producer, like Martin Birch, to handle things.&quot;

For all his misgivings, Gillan remembers the period fondly, stating in the &quot;Black Sabbath: 1978–1992&quot; documentary, &quot;But by God, we had a good year...And the songs, I think, were quite good.&quot;

==Breakup==
After Bill Ward had left the band for rehab, former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan was hired for the subsequent tour. Bevan was a friend of Iommi&#x27;s who knew Don Arden well, but he was ultimately not a heavy metal drummer. Following the tour, in which Gillan refused to learn the lyrics to much of the band&#x27;s Osbourne-era material, this version of Black Sabbath fell apart, with Gillan and Bevan quitting.

The tour was also a breaking point for Butler, who admits in the &quot;Black Sabbath: 1978–1992&quot; documentary, &quot;I just got totally disillusioned with the whole thing and I left some time in 1984 after the &quot;Born Again&quot; tour. I just had enough of it.&quot; In 2015, Butler clarified to Dave Everley of Classic Rock: &quot;I left because my second child was born and he was having problems, so I wanted to stay with him. I told Tony I couldn&#x27;t concentrate on the band anymore. But I never fell out with anybody.&quot; While the members all got along well enough, Butler questioned Gillan&#x27;s commitment after his refusal to learn the lyrics to the band&#x27;s older material, and Butler says the looming Deep Purple reunion was the deciding factor in the vocalist&#x27;s decision to leave. Iommi was unhappy when Gillan told him the news, as he thought it had been a long-term arrangement. Disagreements with management also contributed to the band&#x27;s dissolution.

==Album cover==
The &quot;Born Again&quot; album cover – depicting what Martin Popoff described as a &quot;garish red devil-baby&quot; – is by Steve &#x27;Krusher&#x27; Joule, a &quot;Kerrang!&quot; designer who also worked on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;. It is based on a black-and-white photocopy of a photograph published in a 1968 magazine. Joule was said to have deliberately delivered a sub-par cover due to his involvement with and loyalty to the band&#x27;s former vocalist Osbourne.

Butler called the cover &quot;a bit sick, but (Arden) loved it, so that was that.&quot; Gillan told the press that he vomited when he first saw the picture. However, Iommi approved the cover, which has long been regarded as one of the worst in rock music history. Ben Mitchell of &quot;Blender&quot; called the cover &quot;awful&quot;. The British magazine, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, ranked the cover in second place, behind only the Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Lovedrive&quot;, on their list of &quot;10 Worst Album Sleeves in Metal/Hard Rock&quot;. The list was based on votes from the magazine&#x27;s readers. &quot;NME&quot; included the sleeve on their list of the &quot;29 sickest album covers ever&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included it on their list of &quot;50 most hilariously ugly rock and metal album covers ever&quot;. Sabbath&#x27;s manager Don Arden was quite hostile towards the band&#x27;s ex-vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had recently married his daughter Sharon, and was fond of telling Osbourne that his children resembled the &quot;Born Again&quot; cover.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Born Again&quot; was released in September 1983 and was a commercial success. It was the highest charting Black Sabbath album in the United Kingdom since &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; (1973), and became an American Top 40 hit. Despite this, it was the first Black Sabbath album to fall short of RIAA certification.

The album received mixed reviews upon its release. AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia wrote that the album has &quot;gone down as one of heavy metal&#x27;s all-time greatest disappointments&quot; and described &quot;Zero the Hero&quot;, &quot;Hot Line&quot;, and &quot;Keep It Warm&quot; as &quot;embarrassing&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; contributor Ben Mitchell gave the album one out of five stars and claimed that the music on &quot;Born Again&quot; was worse than its cover. Martin Charles Strong, the author of &quot;The Essential Rock Discography&quot;, wrote that it was &quot;an exercise in heavy-metal cliché&quot;. However, &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Adrien Begrand has noted the album as &quot;overlooked&quot;. The British magazine &quot;Metal Forces&quot; defined it &quot;a very good album&quot; even if &quot;Gillan may not be the perfect frontman for the Sabs&quot;.

Despite the overall negative reception with critics, the album remains a fan favorite. Author Martin Popoff has written that &quot;if any album in the history of Black Sabbath is getting a new set of horns up from metalheads here deep into the new century, it&#x27;s &quot;Born Again&quot;.&quot; Industrial metal band Godflesh and death metal band Cannibal Corpse both have covered &quot;Zero the Hero&quot;, the former appears on the &quot;Masters Of Misery - Black Sabbath: The Earache Tribute&quot; album while the latter is featured on the &quot;Hammer Smashed Face&quot; EP. Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s former singer, Chris Barnes, has called &quot;Born Again&quot; his favourite Black Sabbath album. &quot;Zero the Hero&quot; has also been cited as the inspiration for the Guns N&#x27; Roses hit &quot;Paradise City&quot;, and in his autobiography Iommi also suggests the Beastie Boys may have borrowed the riff from &quot;Hot Line&quot; for their hit &quot;(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)&quot;. Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich has called &quot;Born Again&quot; &quot;one of the best Black Sabbath albums&quot;. Bill Stevenson, former drummer of Black Flag, stated the band was listening to the album around the time of &quot;My War&quot;, defining songs like &quot;Trashed&quot; and &quot;Disturbing the Priest&quot; as &quot;ideal&quot;. Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson has also defended the album, saying &quot;&#x27;Born Again&#x27; — great album. Everybody goes, &#x27;Oh, forget that one.&#x27; No, it&#x27;s a great album.&quot;

In 1984, Ozzy Osbourne stated that the album was the &quot;best thing I&#x27;ve heard from Sabbath since the original group broke up&quot;. Butler has pointed to &quot;Zero the Hero&quot; and &quot;Disturbing the Priest&quot; as his favorites on the album. Butler has said that while he initially felt that the poor production had spoiled &quot;Born Again&quot;, upon re-listening to it decades later &quot;it was a lot better than I remembered&quot;, saying &quot;If the songs are good enough, you can get away with iffy production.&quot; He points to Iommi&#x27;s riffs and says &quot;Ian&#x27;s singing is great&quot;. In 1992, Iommi confessed to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;To be honest, I didn&#x27;t like some of the songs on that album, and the production was awful. We never had time to test the pressings after it was recorded, and something happened to it by the time it got released.&quot;

Ian Gillan expressed disappointment in the final production mix of the album, saying that although he did not break his first copy of it, &quot;I threw it out the window of my car. [Laughs]&quot; He also reflected on the touring activity with the band, &quot;I was with Black Sabbath for a year and I sang Ozzy Osbourne songs as well as the songs from &quot;Born Again&quot;. And I never felt right doing that. It was great — I could sing them okay — but I didn&#x27;t sound like Ozzy. There was something not quite right.&quot;

A re-mastered &#x27;Deluxe Expanded Edition&#x27; of &quot;Born Again&quot; was released in May 2011 by Sanctuary Records. It included several live tracks from the 1983 Reading Festival originally featured on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot;. Though the release was remastered, it was not remixed due to the inability to locate the original master tapes, as well as Sanctuary not wanting delay the release in an effort to locate said tapes for a remix.

In 2021, Tony Iommi claimed that the original master tapes, long thought lost, had been found and that he was considering remixing them for an eventual release.

==&quot;Born Again&quot; Tour and Stonehenge props==

According to Iommi&#x27;s autobiography, Ward began drinking again near the end of the &quot;Born Again&quot; recording sessions and returned to Los Angeles for treatment. The band recruited Bev Bevan, who had played with The Move and ELO, for the upcoming tour in support of the new album. Gillan had all the lyrics to the Sabbath songs written out and plastered all over the stage, explaining to Martin Baker in 1992, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get into my brain any of these lyrics...I cannot soak in these words. There&#x27;s no storyline. I can&#x27;t relate to what they mean.&quot; Gillan attempted to overcome the problem by having a cue book with plastic pages on stage, which he would turn with his foot during the show. However, Gillan did not anticipate the &quot;six buckets&quot; of dry ice that engulfed the stage, making it impossible for the singer to see the lyric sheets. &quot;Ian wasn&#x27;t very sure-footed either,&quot; Iommi writes in his memoir. &quot;He once fell over my pedal board. He was waving at the people, stepped back and, bang!, he went arse over head big time.&quot; Gillan also told Birch that it was Don Arden&#x27;s idea to open the show with a crying baby blaring over the speakers and a dwarf made to look exactly like the demonic baby depicted on the &quot;Born Again&quot; album cover miming to the screaming. &quot;We noticed a dwarf walking around the day before the opening show...And we&#x27;re saying to Don, &#x27;We think this is in the worst possible taste, this dwarf, you know?&#x27; And Don&#x27;s going, &#x27;Nah, the kids will love it, it&#x27;ll be great.&#x27;&quot;

The tour is most infamous, however, for the gigantic Stonehenge props the band used. Iommi recalls in his autobiography that it was Butler&#x27;s idea but the designers took his measurements the wrong way and thought it was meant to be life-size. Months later, while rehearsing for the tour at the Birmingham NEC, the stage set arrived. &quot;We were in shock,&quot; writes Iommi. &quot;This stuff was coming in and in and in. It had all these huge columns in the back that were as wide as your average bedroom, the columns in front were about 13 feet high, and we had all the monitors and the side fills as well as all this rock. It was made of fiberglass and wood, and bloody heavy.&quot; The set would be lampooned in Rob Reiner&#x27;s 1984 rock music mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, with the band having the opposite problem of having to use miniature Stonehenge stage props. Butler has said that he told the associate scriptwriter of the film the story of the band&#x27;s performances with their &quot;Stonehenge&quot; stage props. In an interview for the documentary &quot;Black Sabbath: 1978–1992&quot;, Gillan claims Don Arden had the dwarf walk across the top of the Stonehenge props at the start of the show and, as the tape of the screaming baby faded away, fall back &quot;from about thirty-five feet in the air on this big pile of mattresses. And then, &#x27;Dong!&#x27; The bells start and the monks come out, the whole thing. Pure &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;.&quot; The band toured Europe first, playing the Reading Festival (a performance that is included on the 2011 deluxe edition of &quot;Born Again&quot;) and also playing in a bullring in Barcelona in September. Sabbath performed Gillan&#x27;s hit with Deep Purple, &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, on the tour, with Iommi explaining in his memoir, &quot;it seemed like a bum deal for him not to do any of his stuff while he was doing all of ours. I don&#x27;t know if we played it properly but the audience loved it. The critics moaned; it was something out of the bag and they didn&#x27;t want to know then.&quot; In October, the band took the Stonehenge set to America but could only use a portion of it at most gigs because the columns were too high. The set was eventually abandoned. A music video for &quot;Zero the Hero&quot; was also released, featuring performance footage of the band onstage interspersed with scenes involving several grotesque characters performing experiments on a witless young man in a haunted house filled with rats, roosters and a roaming horse.

<text>Beiker Graterol (born November 9, 1974) is a former Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher who pitched in one game for the Detroit Tigers in 1999.

==Career==
Graterol was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays as an amateur free agent in 1992. After spending a few years pitching in the Dominican Republic, he joined the Blue Jays system in 1996 with the St. Catharines Stompers of the New York–Penn League. In 1998, he pitched for the Lara Cardinals en route to a Venezuelan Professional Baseball League championship. On December 14, 1998, he was traded by Toronto to the Detroit Tigers for Eric Ludwick. The Tigers invited him to Major League spring training in 1999.

Graterol made his first and only Major League appearance on April 9, 1999 when he started for the Tigers against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in place of an injured Bryce Florie. Graterol lasted only four innings in a rainy game, surrendering seven earned runs and three home runs, including a grand slam by Chili Davis. After the game, Graterol told reporters he would learn from his mistakes and &quot;be better next time.&quot; However, before appearing in another game, he was demoted to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens on April 17, never to return to the Major Leagues.

Graterol was unable to find even a minor league contract after the 1999 season and spent 2000 with the Mexico City Tigres of the Mexican League. After a poor year in 2000, Graterol never pitched in affiliated ball again. Later in his career, he pitched for the Rimini Baseball Club of the Italian Baseball League.

Internationally, Graterol played for the Venezuela national baseball team at the 2007 Baseball World Cup.

<doc id="656752" wikidata="Q877603" url="?curid=656752" title="Flag of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The flag of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 17 December 1952 by the government of the Armenian SSR. The flag is similar to the flag of the Soviet Union but has a ¼-width horizontal blue stripe in the middle. The red represents the &quot;revolutionary struggle of the working masses&quot; and the golden hammer and sickle represents the peasants&#x27; and workers&#x27; union.

==History==
The first flag of the Armenian SSR was introduced in the constitution, accepted on 2 February 1922 by the First Congress of Soviets of the Armenian SSR. The 1922 flag was red with the Cyrillic characters ССРА (&quot;SSRA&quot; for Социалистическая Советская Республика Армения, &quot;Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika Armeniya&quot;) in the upper left corner.

That flag existed only for a month, because on March 12 the Armenian SSR united with the Georgian SSR and the Azerbaijan SSR under the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR), that was split again into these three republics in 1936.

Between 1936 and 1940, the flag was red with the gold hammer and sickle in the top left hand corner. The Armenian characters ՀԽՍՀ (&quot;HKSH&quot; for Հայկական Խորհրդային Սոցիալիստական Հանրապետություն, &quot;Haykakan Khorhrdayin Sotsialistakan Hanrapetutiun&quot;) were in gold beneath the hammer and sickle.

Between 1940 and 1952, after reforms on Armenian language, the Armenian characters in the top left hand corner beneath the hammer and sickle were changed to ՀՍՍՌ (&quot;HSSR&quot; for Հայկական Սովետական Սոցիալիստական Ռեսպուբլիկա, &quot;Haykakan Sovetakan Sotsialistakan Respublika&quot;) staying in gold.

The 1952 flag was replaced in 1990 by the tricolor flag of Armenia based on the 1918 flag of the first Republic of Armenia.

<text>The flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was a plain red flag with a golden hammer and sickle and a gold-bordered red star in its upper canton and an horizontal dark blue band on the bottom fourth, representing the Caspian Sea.

The last version of the flag of the Azerbaijan SSR was firstly introduced by K.M.A. Kyazimzade, director of the Azerbaijan State Museum of Art, and was officially adopted as national flag by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR on October 7, 1952. Definition was as follows:

The text of national flag in the Constitution of the Azerbaijan SSR was updated on 18 August 1953. However, the text didn&#x27;t specify the proportion of the hammer and sickle. On 5 May 1956, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR approved the &quot;Regulations on the State flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;, which further regulated the details of the elements on the flag. On 16 March 1981, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR further issued a decree specify that no hammer and sickle should be printed on the reverse side of the flag.

== Color scheme ==

== History ==
From the second part of 1921 to 1922, the Azerbaijan SSR used a red flag with the yellow Cyrillic characters &quot;АССР&quot; (ASSR). On 12 March 1922, the Azerbaijan SSR united with the Georgian SSR and the Armenian SSR under the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR), that was split again into these three republics in 1936.
In 1937, a golden hammer and sickle was added in the top left-hand corner, with beneath the Latin characters &quot;AzSSR&quot; in a serif font in place of the Cyrillic characters. A third version was issued in 1940s, and had &quot;AzSSR&quot; substituted by its Cyrillic version &quot;АзССР&quot;.

The last version of the flag was adopted by the Azerbaijan SSR on 7 October 1952. It was the flag of the Soviet Union, with a horizontal blue band on the bottom fourth. The 1952 flag was discarded on 5 February 1991, when the flag of Azerbaijan SSR based on the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was re-introduced.

<text>The Flag of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 25 December 1951. Prior to this, the flag was red with the Cyrillic characters &quot;БССР&quot; (&quot;BSSR&quot;) in gold in the top-left corner, surrounded by a gold border. Between 1937 and the adoption of the above flag in the 1940s, the flag was the same, but with a gold hammer and sickle above the Cyrillic characters and no border. Between 1919 and 1927, the flag was red, with the Cyrillic characters &quot;ССРБ&quot; (&quot;SSRB&quot;) in the top left-hand corner. In early 1919, a plain red flag was used. The final BSSR flag was used until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. A flag based on this Soviet design is used as the national flag of Belarus.

==Design on the 1951 flag==
In the end of the 1940s, the political need had arisen to have somewhat visually different designs of the flags of the USSR republics, especially for those that were UN members. For the BSSR flag, the image of the Belarusian folk design was chosen as a distinctive feature of the flag. The picture of the embroidery on the «ruchnik» (handtowel) had been found in the pre-World War II archives of the Belpramsavyet. The embroidery had been made in 1917 by peasant Ms. Matrona Markyevich of the village Kastsilishcha of the Sennin region, and had been named «The Rising Sun». Artist M. I. Gusyew had prepared the project of the BSSR flag, basing it on the embroidery, with several symbolic elements added.

Symbolically, the design on the BSSR flag is decoded as follows (considering design strip positioned &quot;horizontally&quot;):
* the central rhombus figure symbolises the rising Sun;
* the horn-like figures to the left and right of it symbolise wealth and welfare;
* the figure inside of the rhombus is the &quot;key to happiness&quot;;
* the rectangular figure with the smaller rectangles adjoining from the left and right is the &quot;votive sign&quot;, expressing the desire for fulfillment of hopes;
* the pattern figure symbolises bread (it was absent from the original embroidery, added after some discussion).

==Previous flags of the Soviet era==
Before 1951, several different flags had been in use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during the existence of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering &quot;ССРБ&quot; (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters; at the same time, the typeface was changed, and the text of the lettering was altered to &quot;БССР&quot; (BSSR). During the 1940s, the hammer and sickle and red star were removed from the flag, and a gold border was added to the letters. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag. In August 1991, the white-red-white flag was reintroduced as the new flag of the newly independent Belarus. In 1995, the 1951 version was reused with minor changes: the communist symbol was removed and the white-in-red ornament changed to a red-in-white one.

<text>The Vektor R4 is a South African 5.56×45mm assault rifle. It entered service as the standard service rifle of the South African Defence Force (SADF) in 1980. In South African service, the R4 replaced the R1, a variant of the 7.62×51mm FN FAL. It was produced by Lyttelton Engineering Works (LIW, &quot;Lyttelton Ingenieurswerke&quot;), now Denel Land Systems.

The weapon is a licensed variant of the IMI Galil assault rifle with several modifications; both the stock and magazine are now made of a high-strength polymer and the stock was lengthened, adapting the weapon for the average South African soldier. Other detailed differences include the R4&#x27;s lack of a carry handle and a number of modifications made to its internal operating mechanism.

==Design details==
===Operating mechanism===
The R4 is a selective fire, gas-operated weapon that fires from a closed bolt. As with the IMI Galil, the operating system is derived from that of the AK-47. It uses ignited powder gases channelled through a vent in the barrel to drive a long stroke piston located above the barrel in a gas cylinder to provide power to the operating system. The weapon features a self-regulating gas system and a rotary bolt breech locking mechanism (equipped with two locking lugs), which is rotated by a helical camming groove machined into the bolt carrier that engages a control pin on the bolt. Extraction is carried out by means of a spring-loaded extractor contained in the bolt and a protrusion on the left guide rail inside the receiver acts as the fixed ejector.

Internally, the R4 differs from the Galil in the addition of a new gas tube lock to prevent the tube from shaking loose during sustained fire, and the introduction of much wider sear. It also has a unique bolt and firing pin, both of which were redesigned to resolve an issue where the firing pin would set off a chambered cartridge with the bolt closed. The new firing pin is secured by a polyurethane piece inside the bolt except when positively driven forward.

The R4&#x27;s parts can be interchanged with the Galil ARM with Valmet rifle magazine made for 5.56 NATO caliber being usable for the R4.

===Features===

The R4 is hammer-fired and uses a trigger mechanism with a 3-position fire selector and safety switch. The stamped sheet steel selector bar is present on both sides of the receiver and its positions are marked with letters: &quot;S&quot;— indicating the weapon is safe, &quot;R&quot;—single-fire mode (&quot;R&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;repetition&quot;), and &quot;A&quot;—fully automatic fire. The &quot;safe&quot; setting disables the trigger and secures the weapon from being charged.

The R4 is fed from a steel or synthetic box magazine with a 35-round cartridge capacity (designed to use the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge with the M193 projectile). Steel magazines were initially manufactured for the weapon, but this was replaced by a nylon and fiberglass copy to reduce weight. A 50-round steel magazine was produced during the 1980s.

The R4 has a side-folding tubular stock, which folds to the right side of the receiver. The rifle&#x27;s handguard, pistol grip, magazine, stock arms and shoulder pad are all made from a synthetic material, making it lighter in weight than the equivalent original Galil, which uses heavier metal and wood in these components.

For regular field maintenance and cleaning, the firearm is disassembled into the following components: the receiver and barrel group, bolt carrier, bolt, return mechanism, gas tube, receiver dust cover and magazine.

===Sights===
The rifle has conventional iron sights that consist of a front post and a flip-up rear sight with 300 and 500 m apertures. The front sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and is installed in a durable circular shroud. The rear sight is welded at the end of the receiver&#x27;s dust cover. For nighttime use, the R4 is equipped with self-luminous tritium light dots (exposed after placing the rear sight in an intermediate position) installed in a pivoting bar to the front sight base, which folds up in front of the standard post and aligns with two dots in the rear sight notch.

==Upgrade==
DLS has introduced remanufactured models of the R4, R5, R6 that have Picatinny rails. DLS has also introduced grenade launchers, grips and other underbarrel attachments.

==Variants==
The South African Navy, South African Air Force, South African Military Health Service, and South African Police Service adopted a short carbine version of the 5.56 mm Galil SAR, which was license-manufactured as the R5. The R5, when compared to the larger R4, has a barrel that is shorter, together with a shorter gas system and handguard. It also lacks a bipod, and the flash hider does not support rifle grenades.

In the 1990s, an even more compact personal defence weapon variant of the R5 was developed for armoured vehicle crews, designated the R6, which has a further reduced barrel and a shortened gas cylinder and piston assembly. This reduced the barrel length to .

Denel developed prototypes for the R7 and R8, a heavy barrelled squad automatic weapon and a locally produced Micro-Galil, respectively, but it is unclear whether these entered production.

LIW/DLS also introduced a line of semi-automatic variants of the R4, R5 and R6 called the LM4, LM5 and LM6 respectively, built for civilian and law enforcement users. The rifles were marketed by Musgrave, with the joint venture between the Lyttelton and Musgrave conferring the rifle&#x27;s &quot;LM&quot; prefix.

==Users==
* : Burundian rebels
* : Eswatini Police
*: Used by the Armed Forces of Haiti and Haitian National Police
*: Malawi Police Service.
*: 15,900 R4/R5s were delivered to Congolese security forces in 1996 and 1997.

== In popular culture ==
*&quot;Savior&quot;: 1998 war film starring Dennis Quaid set during the Bosnian War. Quaid&#x27;s character uses an R4 modified as a designated marksman rifle. According to Imdb, this weapon would have been used by the Bosnian Serb military which purchased several thousand R4 rifles during the conflict, but not by the French Foreign Legion. The modifications include a scope mounted on an AK-style receiver mount (the original Galil scope mount notch was replaced by a lightning cut on the R4), along with a cheek rest which has been installed on the original folding stock and removal of the sights.
*&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;: 2004 war drama starring Don Cheadle set during the Rwandan genocide; in this film a Rwandan soldier is seen using an R4 in several scenes. 
*&quot;Machine Gun Preacher&quot;: 2011 biopic war film starring Gerard Butler, where soldiers of the South Sudan People&#x27;s Defence Forces are seen using modified R4s.

<text>The Kindertransport (German for &quot;children&#x27;s transport&quot;) was an organised rescue effort of children from Nazi-controlled territory that took place in 1938–1939 during the nine months prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. The United Kingdom took in nearly 10,000 children, most of them Jewish, from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Free City of Danzig. The children were placed in British foster homes, hostels, schools, and farms. Often they were the only members of their families who survived the Holocaust. The programme was supported, publicised, and encouraged by the British government, which waived the visa immigration requirements that were not within the ability of the British Jewish community to fulfil. The British government placed no numerical limit on the programme; it was the start of the Second World War that brought it to an end, by which time about 10,000 kindertransport children had been brought to the country.

Smaller numbers of children were taken in via the programme by the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Switzerland. The term &quot;Kindertransport&quot; may also be applied to the rescue of mainly Jewish children from Nazi German territory to the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An example is the 1,000 Chateau de La Hille children who went to Belgium. However, most often the term is restricted to the organised programme of the United Kingdom.

References in literature and testimonials to &quot;Kindertransports to Palestine&quot; use the term &quot;Kindertransport&quot; only in the general sense of &quot;a transport of children,&quot; as they refer to the emigration of teenagers with Hachsharah certificates to Palestine. Pre-war Kindertransports that included young children without such certificates were prohibited from legal entry into British-controlled Mandatory Palestine after the Jewish Agency for Palestine&#x27;s 1938 application was turned down by the British Colonial Office.

The Central British Fund for German Jewry (now World Jewish Relief) was established in 1933 to support in whatever way possible the needs of Jews in Germany and Austria.

In the United States, the Wagner–Rogers Bill was introduced in Congress, which would have increased the quota of immigrants by bringing to the U.S. a total of 20,000 refugee children, but it did not pass.

==Policy==

On 15 November 1938, five days after the devastation of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, the &quot;Night of Broken Glass&quot;, in Germany and Austria, a delegation of British, Jewish, and Quaker leaders appealed, in person, to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Neville Chamberlain. Among other measures, they requested that the British government permit the temporary admission of unaccompanied Jewish children, without their parents.

The British Cabinet debated the issue the next day and subsequently prepared a bill to present to Parliament. The bill stated that the government would waive certain immigration requirements so as to allow the entry into Great Britain of unaccompanied children ranging from infants up to the age of 17, under a number of conditions.

No limit upon the permitted number of refugees was ever publicly announced. Initially, the Jewish refugee agencies considered 5,000 as a realistic target goal. However, after the British Colonial Office turned down the Jewish agencies&#x27; separate request to allow the admission of 10,000 children to British-controlled Mandatory Palestine, &quot;this number seems to have been adopted informally as an appropriate goal for Britain herself to meet.&quot;

During the morning of 21 November 1938, before a major House of Commons debate on refugees, the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare met a large delegation representing Jewish and Quaker groups, as well as other groups, working on behalf of refugees. In what was described by Rose Holmes as a &quot;watershed moment&quot; the government accepted &quot;the political recommendation of a coalition of voluntary agencies&quot; but without accepting that the government had any administrative or financial responsibility. The groups, though considering all refugees, were allied under a non-denominational organisation called the &quot;Movement for the Care of Children from Germany&quot;. This organisation was considering only the rescue of children, who would need to leave their parents behind in Germany.

In that debate of 21 November 1938, Hoare paid particular attention to the plight of children. He reported that enquiries in Germany had determined that nearly every parent asked had said that they would be willing to send their child off unaccompanied to the United Kingdom, leaving their parents behind.

Although Hoare declared that he and the Home Office &quot;shall put no obstacle in the way of children coming here,&quot; the agencies involved had to find homes for the children and also fund the operation to ensure that none of the refugees would become a financial burden on the public. Every child had to have a guarantee of £50 sterling to finance his or her eventual re-emigration, as it was expected the children would stay in the country only temporarily. Hoare made it clear that the monetary and housing and other aid required had been promised by the Jewish community and other communities.

==Organisation and management==

Within a short time, the Movement for the Care of Children from Germany, later known as the Refugee Children&#x27;s Movement (RCM), sent representatives to Germany and Austria to establish the systems for choosing, organising, and transporting the children. The Central British Fund for German Jewry provided funding for the rescue operation.

On 25 November, British citizens heard an appeal for foster homes on the BBC Home Service radio station from former Home Secretary Viscount Samuel. Soon there were 500 offers, and RCM volunteers started visiting possible foster homes and reporting on conditions. They did not insist that the homes for Jewish children should be Jewish homes. Nor did they probe too carefully into the motives and character of the families: it was sufficient for the houses to look clean and the families to seem respectable.

In Germany, a network of organisers was established, and these volunteers worked around the clock to make priority lists of those most in peril: teenagers who were in concentration camps or in danger of arrest, Polish children or teenagers threatened with deportation, children in Jewish orphanages, children whose parents were too impoverished to keep them, or children with a parent in a concentration camp. Once the children were identified or grouped by list, their guardians or parents were issued a travel date and departure details. They could only take a small sealed suitcase with no valuables and only ten marks or less in money. Some children had nothing but a manila tag with a number on the front and their name on the back, others were issued with a numbered identity card with a photo:

The first party of 196 children arrived at Harwich on the TSS &quot;Prague&quot; on 2 December, three weeks after &quot;&quot;, disembarking at Parkeston Quay. A plaque unveiled in 2011 at Harwich harbour marks this event.

In the following nine months almost 10,000 unaccompanied children, mainly Jewish, travelled to England.

There were also Kindertransports to other countries, such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. Dutch humanitarian Geertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer arranged for 1,500 children to be admitted to the Netherlands; the children were supported by the Dutch Committee for Jewish Refugees, which was paid by the Dutch Jewish Community. In Sweden, the Jewish Community of Stockholm negotiated with the government for an exception to the country&#x27;s restrictive policy on Jewish refugees for a number of children. Eventually around 500 Jewish children from Germany aged between 1 and 15 were granted temporary residence permits on the condition that their parents would not try to enter the country. The children were selected by Jewish organisations in Germany and placed in foster homes and orphanages in Sweden.

Initially the children came mainly from Germany and Austria (part of the Greater Reich after Anschluss). From 15 March 1939, with the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, transports from Prague were hastily organised. In February and August 1939, trains from Poland were arranged. Transports out of Nazi-occupied Europe continued until the declaration of war on 1 September 1939.

A smaller number of children flew to Croydon Airport, mainly from Prague. Other ports in England receiving the children included Dover.

===Last transport===

The last transport from the continent with 74 children left on the passenger-freighter on 14 May 1940, from IJmuiden, Netherlands. Their departure was organised by Geertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer, the Dutch organiser of the first transport from Vienna in December 1938. She had collected 66 of the children from the orphanage on the &quot;&quot; in Amsterdam, part of which had been serving as a home for refugees. She could have joined the children, but chose to remain behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;kindertransport.org/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was a rescue action, as occupation of the Netherlands was imminent, with the country capitulating the next day. This ship was the last to leave the country freely.

As the Netherlands was under attack by German forces from 10 May and bombing had been going on, there was no opportunity to confer with the parents of the children. At the time of this evacuation, these parents knew nothing of the evacuation of their children: according to unnamed sources, some of the parents were initially very upset about this action and told Wijsmuller-Meijer that she should not have done this. After 15 May, there was no more opportunity to leave the Netherlands as the country&#x27;s borders were closed by the Nazis.

==Trauma suffered by the children==

Many children went through trauma during their extensive &quot;Kindertransport&quot; experience. Reports of this trauma is often presented in personal terms, with trauma varying based on the child&#x27;s experiences, including their age at separation from their parents, their experience during the wartime, and their experience after the war.

The primary trauma experienced by children in the &quot;Kindertransport&quot; was the separation from their parents. Depending on the child&#x27;s age, the explanation for why they were leaving the country and their parents differed widely: for example, children might be told &quot;you are going on an exciting adventure&quot;, or &quot;you are going on a short trip and we will see you soon&quot;. Young children, roughly six or younger, would generally not accept such an explanation and would demand to stay with their parents.

Older children, who were &quot;more willing to accept the parents&#x27; explanation&quot;, would nevertheless realise that they would be separated from their parents for a long or indefinite period of time; younger children, in contrast, who had no developed sense of time, would not be able to comprehend that they may see their parents again, thus making the trauma of separation total from the beginning. The actual leaving, via railway station, was also not a peaceful process, and there are many records of tears and screaming at the various railway stations where the actual parting took place.

Having to learn a new language, in a country where the child&#x27;s native German or Czech was not understood, was another cause of stress. To have to learn to live with strangers, who only spoke English, and accept them as &quot;pseudo-parents&quot;, was a trauma. At school, the English children would often view the refugee children as &quot;enemy Germans&quot; instead of &quot;Jewish refugees&quot;.

Before the war started on 1 September 1939, and even during the first part of the war, some parents were able to escape from Hitler and reach England and then reunite with their children. However, this became the exception, as most of the parents of the refugee children were murdered by the Nazis.

Older refugee children became fully aware of the war in Europe during the period of 1939–1945 and would become concerned for their parents. During the latter years of the war, they may have become aware of the Holocaust and the actual direct threat to their Jewish parents and extended family. After the war ended in 1945, nearly all the children learned, sooner or later, that their parents had been murdered.

In November 2018, for the 80th anniversary of the &quot;Kindertransport&quot; programme, the German government announced that it would make a payment of €2,500 (about US$2,800 at the time) to each of the &quot;Kinder&quot; who was still alive. This payment, although a token amount, represented an explicit recognition and acceptance of the immense damage that had been done to each child, both psychological and material.

==Transportation and programme completion==

The Nazis had decreed that the evacuations must not block ports in Germany, so most transport parties went by train to the Netherlands; then to a British port, generally Harwich, by ferry from the Hook of Holland near Rotterdam. From the port, a train took some of the children to Liverpool Street station in London, where they were met by their volunteer foster parents. Children without prearranged foster families were sheltered at temporary holding centres at summer holiday camps such as Dovercourt and Pakefield, with the Broadreeds holiday camp, at Selsey, West Sussex, being used as a transit camp for girls. While most transports went via train, some also went by boat, and others aeroplane.

The first &quot;Kindertransport&quot; was organised and masterminded by Florence Nankivell. She spent a week in Berlin, hassled by the Nazi police, organising the children. The train left Berlin on 1 December 1938, and arrived in Harwich on 2 December with 196 children. Most were from a Berlin Jewish orphanage burned by the Nazis during the night of 9 November, and the others were from Hamburg.

The first train from Vienna left on 10 December 1938 with 600 children. This was the result of the work of Geertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer, a Dutch organiser of Kindertransports, who had been active in this field since 1933. She went to Vienna with the purpose of negotiating with Adolf Eichmann directly, but was initially turned away. She persevered however, until finally, as she wrote in her biography, Eichmann suddenly &quot;gave&quot; her 600 children with the clear intent of overloading her and making a transport on such short notice impossible. Nevertheless, Wijsmuller-Meijer managed to send 500 of the children to Harwich, where they were accommodated in a nearby holiday camp at Dovercourt, while the remaining 100 found refuge in the Netherlands.

Many representatives went with the parties from Germany to the Netherlands, or met the parties at Liverpool Street station in London and ensured that there was someone there to receive and care for each child. Between 1939 and 1941, 160 children without foster families were sent to the Whittingehame Farm School in East Lothian, Scotland. The Whittingehame estate was the family home of Arthur Balfour, former UK prime minister and, in 1917, author of the Balfour Declaration.

The RCM ran out of money at the end of August 1939, and decided it could take no more children. The last group of children left Germany on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, and two days later Britain, France, and other countries declared war on Germany. A party left Prague on 3 September 1939, but was sent back.

==Sculpture groups on the &quot;Kindertransport&quot; route==
Marking the European route of the children&#x27;s transport and created from personal experience, Frank Meisler&#x27;s sculpture groups show similarities but with different details. The memorials show two groups of children and young people standing with their backs to each other waiting for a train. Depicted in different colours, the group of the rescued is outnumbered, as the majority of Jewish children (more than one million) perished in the Nazi death camps.
* 2006: &quot;Kindertransport – The Arrival&quot; at the initiative of Prince Charles there is a monument to the Kindertransporten at London&#x27;s Liverpool Street Station, where the children from Hook of Holland arrived.
* 2008: Children&#x27;s Transport Monument. &quot;Züge ins Leben – Züge in den Tod: 1938–1939&quot; (Trains to life – trains to death) at Berlin Friedrichstraße station for the rescue of 10,000 Jewish children, who travelled from here to London. The monument was unveiled on 30 November 2008.
* 2009: &quot;Kindertransport – Die Abreise&quot; (The Departure). At the request of the mayor of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz, Frank Meisler designed another group of children&#x27;s sculptures in May 2009, in memory of 124 departing children.
* 2011: &quot;Crossing Channel to life&quot;. Monument to the 10,000 Jewish children who travelled from Hook of Holland to Harwich. The newspaper &quot;De Rotterdammer&quot; of 11 November 1938 is depicted next to the sitting boy, with the messages &quot;The admission of German Jewish children&quot; and &quot;Thousands of Jews must leave Germany&quot;.
* 2015: &quot;Kindertransport – Der letzte Abschied&quot; (The last farewell), at Hamburg Dammtor station.

In September 2022 a bronze memorial entitled &quot;Safe Haven&quot; was unveiled on Harwich Quay by Dame Steve Shirley, a former Kindertransport child. The work by artist Ian Wolter is a life-size, bronze sculpture of five Kindertransport refugees descending a ship&#x27;s gangplank. Each child is portrayed with a different emotion representing the storm of emotions they must have felt at the end of their journey by train and then ship. The figures are also engraved with quotes of four of the refugees describing their first experience of the UK. The memorial is within sight of the landing place at Parkeston Quay of thousands of Kindertransport children.

==Habonim hostels==
A number of members of &quot;Habonim&quot;, a Jewish youth movement inclined to socialism and Zionism, were instrumental in running the country hostels of South West England. These members of Habonim were held back from going to live on kibbutz by the war.

==Records==

Records for many of the children who arrived in the UK through the Kindertransports are maintained by World Jewish Relief through its Jewish Refugees Committee.

==Recovery==
At the end of the war, there were great difficulties in Britain as children from the Kindertransport tried to reunite with their families. Agencies were flooded with requests from children seeking to find their parents, or any surviving member of their family. Some of the children were able to reunite with their families, often travelling to far-off countries in order to do so. Others discovered that their parents had not survived the war. In her novel about the Kindertransport titled &quot;The Children of Willesden Lane&quot;, Mona Golabek describes how often the children who had no families left were forced to leave the homes that they had gained during the war in boarding houses in order to make room for younger children flooding the country.

==Nicholas Winton==

Before Christmas 1938, Nicholas Winton, a 29-year-old British stockbroker of German-Jewish origin, travelled to Prague to help a friend involved in Jewish refugee work. Under the loose direction of the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, headed by Doreen Warriner, Winton spent three weeks in Prague compiling a list of children in Czechoslovakia, mostly Jewish, who were refugees from Nazi Germany. He then went back to Britain with the objective of fulfilling the legal requirements to bring the children to Britain and to find homes for them. Trevor Chadwick remained behind to head the children&#x27;s programme in Czechoslovakia. Winton&#x27;s mother also worked with him to place the children in homes, and later hostels, with a team of sponsors from groups like Maidenhead Rotary Club and Rugby Refugee Committee. Throughout the summer, he placed advertisements seeking British families to take them in. A total of 669 children were evacuated from Czechoslovakia to Britain in 1939 through the work of Chadwick, Warriner, Beatrice Wellington, Waitstill and Martha Sharp, Quaker volunteers such as Tessa Rowntree, and others who worked in Czechoslovakia while Winton was in Britain. The last group of children, which left Prague on 3 September 1939, was turned back because the Nazis had invaded Poland – the beginning of the Second World War. The children travelled to Britain while their parents remained in Czechoslovakia. The settlement of the children in Britain without their parents was perceived at the time as a temporary measure but the war began.

The work of the BCRC in Czechoslovakia was little noted until 1988 when the refugee children held a reunion. By that time most of the people who had worked in the kindertransport in Czechoslovakia had died and Winton became the living symbol of British help to refugees fleeing the Nazis, especially Jewish refugees, before the Second World War. Winton has been lionised by both the British and Czech governments &quot;in part to reframe their national Holocaust histories more positively.&quot; Latter-day historians have acknowledged the contribution of Winton, but characterised the kindertransport from Czechoslovakia as &quot;a grassroots transnational network of escape...This network connected Boston-based Unitarians, London-based socialists, and Prague-based Jewish social workers in a complex web of interfaith refugee assistance.&quot;

==Wilfrid Israel==
Wilfrid Israel (1899–1943) was a key figure in the rescue of Jews from Germany and occupied Europe. He warned the British government, through Lord Samuel, of the impending Kristallnacht in November 1938. Through a British agent, Frank Foley, passport officer at the Berlin consulate, he kept British intelligence informed of Nazi activities. Speaking on behalf of the &#x27; (the German Jewish communal organisation) and the &#x27; (the self-help body), he urged a plan of rescue on the Foreign Office and helped British Quakers to visit Jewish communities across Germany to prove to the British government that Jewish parents were indeed prepared to part with their children.

==Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld==
Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld brought in 300 children who practised Orthodox Judaism, under auspices of the Chief Rabbi&#x27;s Religious Emergency Council. He housed many of them in his London home for a while. During the Blitz he found for them in the countryside often non-Jewish foster homes. In order to ensure that the children followed Jewish dietary laws (&quot;Kashrut&quot;), he instructed them to say to the foster parents that they were fish-eating vegetarians. He also saved large numbers of Jews with South American protection papers. He brought over to England several thousand young people, rabbis, teachers, ritual slaughterers, and other religious functionaries. He was well liked by the UK government and in Parliament and convinced many parliamentarians to pass a Motion allowing Jewish refugees from the Nazis to find safety in places within the British Empire. The initiative was derailed since it excluded Palestine. See the entry Solomon Schonfeld, and Dr. David Kranzler&#x27;s book &quot;Holocaust Hero: Solomon Schonfeld&quot; (Ktav Publishing House, New Jersey, 2004).

==Internment and war service==
In June 1940, Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, ordered the internment of all male 16-to 70-year-old refugees from enemy countries – so-called &#x27;friendly enemy aliens&#x27;. A complete history of this internment episode is given in the book &quot;Collar the Lot!&quot;.

Many of the children who had arrived in earlier years were now young men, and so they were also interned. Approximately 1,000 of these &quot;prior-kinder&quot; were interned in these internment camps, many on the Isle of Man. Around 400 were transported overseas to Canada and Australia (see HMT &quot;Dunera&quot;).

The fast, unescorted liner, was sunk by German submarine &quot;U-47&quot; on 2 July 1940. Many of her 1213 German, Italian, and Austrian refugees, and internees (she was also carrying 86 German POWs) were ex-Kindertransport children. There was difficulty launching the lifeboats, and as a result, 805 people died out of the original complement of 1673. This led to evacuations of British children on passenger liners under the Children&#x27;s Overseas Reception Board and the United States Committee for the Care of European Children to be protected by convoys.

As the camp internees reached the age of 18, they were offered the chance to do war work or to enter the Army Auxiliary Pioneer Corps. About 1,000 German and Austrian &quot;prior-kinder&quot; who reached adulthood went on to serve in the British armed forces, including in combat units. Several dozen joined elite formations such as the Special Forces, where their language skills were put to good use during the Normandy landings, and afterwards as the Allies progressed into Germany. One of these was Peter Masters, who wrote a book which he titled &quot;Striking Back&quot;.

Most of the interned &#x27;friendly enemy aliens&#x27; were refugees who had fled Hitler and Nazism, and nearly all were Jewish. When Churchill&#x27;s internment policy became known, there was a debate in Parliament. Many speeches expressed horror at the idea of interning refugees, and a vote overwhelmingly instructed the Government to &quot;undo&quot; the internment.

==United Kingdom and the United States==
In contrast to the Kindertransport, where the British Government waived immigration visa requirements, these OTC children received no United States government visa immigration assistance. The U.S. government made it difficult for refugees to get entrance visas. However, from 1933 to 1945, the United States accepted about 200,000 refugees fleeing Nazism, more than any other country. Most of the refugees were Jewish.

In 1939 Senator Robert F. Wagner and Rep. Edith Rogers proposed the Wagner-Rogers Bill in the United States Congress. This bill was to admit 20,000 unaccompanied refugees under the age of 14 into the United States from Germany and areas under German control. Most of the child refugees would have been Jewish. However, due to opposition from Senator Robert Rice Reynolds, it never left the committee stage and failed to get Congressional approval.

==Post-war organisations==
In 1989, , who escaped Germany via Kindertransport, organised the Reunion of Kindertransport, a 50th-anniversary gathering of kindertransportees in London in June 1989. This was a first, with over 1,200 people, kindertransportees and their families, attending from all over the world. Several came from the east coast of the US and wondered whether they could organise something similar in the U.S. They founded the Kindertransport Association in 1991.

The Kindertransport Association is a national American not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to unite these child Holocaust refugees and their descendants. The association shares their stories, honours those who made the Kindertransport possible, and supports charitable work that aids children in need. The Kindertransport Association declared 2 December 2013, the 75th anniversary of the day the first Kindertransport arrived in England, as World Kindertransport Day.

In the United Kingdom, the Association of Jewish Refugees houses a special interest group called the Kindertransport Organisation.

==Winton train==

On 1 September 2009, a special &quot;Winton train&quot; set off from the Prague Main railway station. The train, consisting of an original locomotive and carriages used in the 1930s, headed to London via the original &quot;Kindertransport&quot; route. On board the train were several surviving &quot;Winton children&quot; and their descendants, who were to be welcomed by the then hundred-year-old Sir Nicholas Winton in London. The occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the intended last Kindertransport, which was due to set off on 3 September 1939 but did not because of the outbreak of the war. At the train&#x27;s departure, Sir Nicholas Winton&#x27;s statue was unveiled at the railway station.

== Controversy ==
Jessica Reinisch notes how the British media and politicians alike allude to the Kindertransport in contemporary debates on refugee and migration crises. She argues that &quot;the Kindertransport&quot; is used as evidence of Britain&#x27;s &quot;proud tradition&quot; of taking in refugees; but that such allusions are problematic as the Kinderstransport model is taken out of context and thus subject to nostalgia. She points out that countries such as Britain and the United States did much to prevent immigration by turning desperate people away; at the Évian Conference in 1938, participant nations failed to reach agreement about accepting Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi Germany.

<text>Zhao Mengfu (; courtesy name Zi&#x27;ang (子昂); pseudonyms Songxue (松雪, &quot;Pine Snow&quot;), Oubo (鷗波, &quot;Gull Waves&quot;), and Shuijing-gong Dao-ren (水精宮道人, &quot;Master of the Water Spirits Palace&quot;); 1254–1322), was a Chinese calligrapher, painter, and scholar during the Yuan dynasty. He was a descendant of the Song dynasty&#x27;s imperial family through Emperor Xiaozong&#x27;s brother Zhao Bogui who married a lady surnamed Song who was the granddaughter of Emperor Huizong. Zhao Bogui was a descendant of Emperor Taizu, through his son Zhao Defang.

He was recommended by the Censor-in-chief to pay an audience with Kublai Khan in 1286 at the Yuan capital of Dadu, but was not awarded an important position in office. His work was however, greatly appreciated later by the Confucian-inspired Yuan Emperor Renzong. Zhao was a member of the &quot;Academy of Worthies&quot;.

He was married to Guan Daosheng, who was also an accomplished poet, painter and calligrapher. His rejection of the refined, gentle brushwork of his era in favour of the cruder style of the eighth century is considered to have brought about a revolution that created the modern Chinese landscape painting. He was known for his paintings of horses. His landscapes are also considered to be done in a style that focuses more on a literal laying of ground. Rather than organizing them in a foreground, middle ground, and background pattern he layers middle grounds at various heights to create a sense of depth. This pattern of organization makes his paintings appear very simple and approachable. It was this characteristic that so many people valued about his style.

One of his most celebrated landscape paintings is exhibited at the Princeton University Art Museum with the title “The Mind Landscape of Xie Youyu” (幼輿丘壑), an allusion to the nature-loving scholar-official Xie Youyu (280–322). However, in 2019 Dutch scholar Lennert Gesterkamp argued that the colophon attached to the painting and mentioning Xie Youyu is a forgery, and that in fact Zhao Mengfu&#x27;s intention was to honor his own spiritual master, Daoist scholar Du Daojian (1237–1318), who also celebrated nature.

Zhao Mengfu had several sons with his wife Guan Daosheng. His second son, Zhao Yong, also became a famous painter and calligrapher. He was also the maternal grandfather of Wang Meng, another famous painter. Zhao Mengfu was related to the later Ming dynasty literary figure Zhao Yiguang and his son Zhao Jun.

==Legacy==

The former residence of Zhao Mengfu in Huzhou, Zhejiang province has been restored into a museum, and opened to public since 2012.

A 167 kilometer diameter crater on Mercury (132.4° west, 87.3° south) was named the &quot;Chao Meng-Fu crater&quot; in memorial of him.

<doc id="656794" wikidata="Q330334" url="?curid=656794" title="Frank J. Selke">
<text>Francis Joseph Aloysius Selke (; May 7, 1893 – July 3, 1985) was a Canadian professional ice hockey executive in the National Hockey League. He was a nine-time Stanley Cup champion with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens and a Hockey Hall of Fame inductee.

==Executive career==
===Early career===
Born in Berlin, Ontario, Selke was managing the Iroquois Bantams in his hometown at the age of 14. He coached the Berlin Union Jacks junior team in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1912 to 1915, reaching the finals of the league championship in his final season. In 1919, he coached the University of Toronto Schools hockey team to the first Memorial Cup title.

He coached the St. Mary&#x27;s junior OHA team to its third-straight SPA junior championship in the 1924–25 season, with a team that included future Toronto Maple Leafs star Joe Primeau. In 1926–27, the team became the Toronto Marlboros, and again won the junior SPA championship. Eventual Hall of Famer Red Horner was a star defenceman on the Toronto team. During his time with the organization, Selke also coached the Marlboros senior team.

In 1927–28, Selke became coach and manager of the Toronto Ravinas of the Canadian Professional Hockey League, with Primeau as the team&#x27;s leading scorer. The team was bought by the Toronto Maple Leafs and renamed the Toronto Falcons mid-season. Late in the year, the team played some home games in Brantford, Ontario, after drawing poor crowds in Toronto.

Rejoining the Marlboros in 1928–29, Selke helped lead the team to the 1929 Memorial Cup championship.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Selke became the top assistant to Maple Leafs managing director Conn Smythe in September 1929 — a position he would hold until 1946. He helped raise funds for the construction of Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931. While Smythe served in World War II, Selke filled in as acting manager of the Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens. He did such a good job in that role that some of the directors of the company wanted him to remain in charge after Smythe returned.

Selke and Smythe clashed when Selke traded Frank Eddolls to the Montreal Canadiens for the rights to Ted Kennedy in 1943. Though Kennedy would go on to become one of Smythe&#x27;s favourite Leafs, Smythe strongly supported Eddolls at the time and was upset that Selke had not consulted with him before making the deal. Once Smythe returned to Toronto, there was tension between the two, particularly after Selke refused to back Smythe&#x27;s bid to become president of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. With his working conditions becoming intolerable, Selke submitted his resignation in May 1946.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Two months after resigning from the Leafs, Selke was hired as manager of the Montreal Forum and became general manager of the Montreal Canadiens. He took over a team that had just come off two Stanley Cup championships in the previous three seasons but was in financial trouble. Regardless, he signed a great deal of players and created an extensive farm system. Anchored by Hall of Famers Maurice Richard, Elmer Lach, Doug Harvey and Jacques Plante, Selke won his first Stanley Cup with the Canadiens in 1953.

In December 1946, Selke proposed that the NHL sponsor junior ice hockey teams under the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association jurisdiction. The plan implemented a farm system composed of professional prospects spread out across Canada, as opposed to the strongest players being concentrated on all-star teams in Ontario.

===Last years===
By the mid-1950s, the farm system that Selke had established began to put life into the Canadiens, producing additional Hall of Famers Jean Béliveau, Dickie Moore, Tom Johnson and Henri Richard. After falling to the rival Detroit Red Wings in seven games in consecutive years, 1954 and 1955, the Canadiens won a record five consecutive Cups from 1956 to 1960. Selke retired after the 1963–64 season, turning the reins over to Sam Pollock.

He died in 1985 at the age of 92 in Rigaud, Quebec.

==Honours==
A nine-time Stanley Cup champion (1932, 1942, 1945 with the Maple Leafs; 1953, 1956–60 with the Canadiens), Selke was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960. After his retirement in 1978, the NHL inaugurated the Frank J. Selke Trophy that is awarded annually to the best defensive forward in the league.

In the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, the Frank J. Selke Memorial Trophy was awarded annually to the league&#x27;s best defensive forward from 1969 to 2024, until it was renamed the David Desharnais Trophy.

In 2016, Frank J. Selke and his son, Frank Selke Jr., were posthumously recognized by the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame with the Bruce Prentice Legacy Award.

<doc id="656803" wikidata="Q1320886" url="?curid=656803" title="Just Say No">
<text>&quot;Just Say No&quot; was an advertising campaign prevalent during the 1980s and early 1990s as a part of the U.S.-led war on drugs, aiming to discourage children from engaging in illegal recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying &quot;no&quot;. The slogan was created and championed by Nancy Reagan during her husband&#x27;s presidency.

==Initiation==
The campaign emerged from a substance abuse prevention program supported by the National Institutes of Health, pioneered in the 1970s by University of Houston Social Psychology Professor Richard I. Evans. Evans promoted a social inoculation model, which included teaching student skills to resist peer pressure and other social influences. The campaign involved University projects done by students across the nation. Jordan Zimmerman, then a student at University of South Florida, and later an advertising entrepreneur, won the campaign. The anti-drug movement was among the resistance skills recommended in response to low peer pressure, and Nancy Reagan&#x27;s larger campaign proved to be an effective dissemination of this social inoculation strategy.

Nancy Reagan first became involved during a campaign trip in 1980 to Daytop Village in New York City. She recalls feeling impressed by a need to educate the youth about drugs and drug abuse. Upon her husband&#x27;s election to the presidency, she returned to Daytop Village and outlined how she wished to help educate the youth. Nancy Reagan&#x27;s longtime Chief of Staff James Rosebush helped her expedite what she viewed as one of her legacies as First Lady. She stated in 1981 that her best role would be to bring awareness about the dangers of drug abuse:

Understanding what drugs can do to your children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is ... the first step in solving the problem.

==Efforts==


The &quot;Just Say No&quot; slogan was the creation of Robert Cox and David Cantor, advertising executives at the New York office of Needham, Harper &amp; Steers/USA in the early 1980s. The firm was working with the Advertising Council on a media campaign for children, for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Nancy Reagan often attributed the origins of the phrase to a 1982 visit to Longfellow Elementary School in Oakland, California: when asked by a schoolgirl what to do if she was offered drugs by her peers, the First Lady responded, &quot;Just say &#x27;no&#x27;.&quot; Just Say No club organizations within schools and school-run anti-drug programs soon became common, in which young people were making pacts not to use drugs.

When asked about her efforts in the campaign, Nancy Reagan said: &quot;If you can save just one child, it&#x27;s worth it.&quot; She traveled throughout the United States and several other nations, totaling over . Nancy Reagan visited drug rehabilitation centers and abuse prevention programs. With the media attention that the first lady received, she appeared on television talk shows, recorded public service announcements, and wrote guest articles. By the autumn of 1985, she had appeared on 23 talk shows, co-hosted an October 1983 episode of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and starred in a two-hour PBS documentary on drug abuse.

The campaign and the phrase &quot;Just Say No&quot; made their way into popular American culture when television series such as &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; produced episodes centered on the campaign. In 1983, Nancy Reagan appeared as herself on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; to garner support for the anti-drug campaign. She participated in a 1985 rock music video &quot;Stop the Madness&quot; as well. She even appeared in numerous public service announcements, including one which aired in movie theaters where she appeared alongside actor Clint Eastwood. La Toya Jackson became spokesperson for the campaign in 1987 and recorded a song titled &quot;Just Say No&quot; with British hit producers Stock/Aitken/Waterman.

In 1985, Nancy Reagan expanded the campaign internationally. She invited the First Ladies of 30 nations to the White House in Washington, DC, for a conference entitled the &quot;First Ladies Conference on Drug Abuse&quot;. She later became the first First Lady invited to address the United Nations.

She enlisted the help of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America, Kiwanis Club International, and the National Federation of Parents for a Drug-Free Youth to promote the cause; the Kiwanis put up over 2000 billboards with Nancy Reagan&#x27;s likeness and the slogan. Over 5000 Just Say No clubs were founded in schools and youth organizations in the United States and abroad. Many clubs and organizations remain in operation around the country, where they aim to educate children and teenagers about the effects of drugs.

Just Say No crossed over to the United Kingdom in the 1980s, where it was popularized by the BBC&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Drugwatch&quot; campaign, which revolved around a heroin-addiction storyline in the popular children&#x27;s TV drama serial &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. The cast&#x27;s cover of the original US campaign song, with an added rap, reached the UK top ten. The death of Anna Wood in Sydney, Australia and British teen Leah Betts from Essex in the mid-1990s sparked a media firestorm across both the UK and Australia over the use of illegal drugs. Wood&#x27;s parents even released her school photograph on a badge with the saying &quot;Just say no to drugs&quot; placed on it to warn society on the dangers of illicit drug use. The photograph was widely circulated in the media. A photo of Betts in a coma in her hospital bed was also circulated in British media. Both teenagers died due to water intoxication as they drank too much water after ingesting ecstasy.

==Effects==

Nancy Reagan&#x27;s related efforts increased public awareness of drug use, but extant research has not established a direct relationship between the Just Say No campaign and reduced drug use. Although the use and abuse of illegal recreational drugs significantly declined during the Reagan presidency, this may be a spurious correlation: a 2009 analysis of 20 controlled studies on enrollment in one of the most popular &quot;Just Say No&quot; programs, DARE, showed no impact on drug use.

The campaign drew significant criticism. Critics labelled Nancy Reagan&#x27;s approach to promoting drug awareness reductive, arguing that tackling the issue of drug abuse required a more complex approach than simply encouraging the use of a catchphrase. In fact, two studies suggested that enrollees in DARE-like programs were actually &quot;more&quot; likely to use alcohol and cigarettes. Journalist Michael McGrath suggested that inflamed fears from &quot;Just Say No&quot; exacerbated mass incarceration and prevented youth from receiving accurate information about dealing with drug abuse and responsible drug use. Critics also think that &quot;Just Say No&quot; contributed towards the well seasoned stigma about people who use drugs being labelled as &quot;bad&quot;, and the stigma toward those people who are addicted to drugs being labelled as making a cognizant immoral choice to engage in drug use. In a 1992 paper, Evans et al. commented: that the &quot;Just Say No&quot; approach had been &quot;taken out of context and redirected in form as a formula for preventing all substance abuse. ... Because of the current pervasiveness of the catchphrase, we emphasize that ‘Just Say No’ is not enough!&quot;

In 2020, when scholars and historians were asked during the Siena College Research Institute&#x27;s first ladies study to assess the signature initiatives of the then most-recent ten first ladies (those from Lady Bird Johnson onward), &quot;Just Say No&quot; was ranked as the second-worst, with only Melania Trump&#x27;s &quot;Be Best&quot; campaign being more lowly assessed.

<text>Reginald C. Lewis (November 21, 1965 – July 27, 1993) was an American professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Boston Celtics from 1987 to 1993. At the age of 27, Lewis died while still a member of the Celtics, and his number was posthumously retired by the team.

==Early life==
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Lewis attended high school at Dunbar High School, where he played basketball alongside future NBA players Muggsy Bogues, Reggie Williams and David Wingate. The 1981–82 Dunbar Poets finished the season at 29–0 during Lewis&#x27; junior season and finished 31–0 during his senior season, and were ranked first in the nation by &quot;USA Today&quot;.

==College career==
Lewis attended Northeastern University in Boston. Over his four years at Northeastern, Lewis scored 2,708 points, still the all-time record at the university. His Northeastern teams won the ECAC North all four seasons and played in the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament every year. The 1983–84 Huskies advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament, falling one point shy of the Sweet 16 when Rolando Lamb scored at the buzzer to lift VCU over the Huskies.

His uniform number was retired and hangs in tribute in Matthews Arena (the home of Northeastern University&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team and the Celtics&#x27; original home arena in 1946). As a Celtic, he and his family lived in Dedham, Massachusetts. He was a second cousin of PJ Dozier, who wore the jersey number 35 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder in honor of Lewis.

==Professional career==

===Boston Celtics (1987–1993)===
Lewis was drafted in the first round, 22nd overall, by the Boston Celtics in the 1987 NBA draft. The Celtics were looking to add some youth to the team, especially for the aging &quot;Big 3&quot; of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish. This need became more urgent after Len Bias, the 2nd overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft, died of a cocaine overdose.

As a rookie, Lewis played sporadically, averaging 8.3 minutes per game under coach K. C. Jones. By his second season, thanks in part to a new coach (and an injury to Bird), Lewis averaged over 30 minutes and scored 18.5 points per game. 

In 1991, Lewis scored a career-high 42 points during a win against the Miami Heat. The following season, Lewis was selected to play in his first and only NBA All-Star Game, held in Orlando, Florida. He played 15 minutes, scoring 7 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.

Lewis averaged 20.8 points in each of his last two seasons with the Celtics, and finished with a career average of 17.6 points per contest.

On April 29, 1993, in Game 1 of the Celtics&#x27; playoff series against the Charlotte Hornets, Lewis collapsed on the court and remained on the ground for several seconds. After he finally got up, he looked perplexed and dazed as he headed to the Celtics bench. Lewis returned briefly to the game but was eventually pulled due to dizziness and shortness of breath. He left the game having scored 17 points in 13 minutes of action in what turned out to be his final NBA game.

The following day, Lewis checked into New England Baptist Hospital, where he underwent a series of tests by more than a dozen heart specialists, whom the Celtics called their &quot;dream team&quot; of doctors. Lewis was diagnosed with &quot;focal cardiomyopathy&quot;, a disease of the heart muscle that can cause irregular heartbeat and heart failure. Lewis was told his condition was most likely career-ending. However, he later sought a second opinion from Dr. Gilbert Mudge at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, who diagnosed Lewis with neurocardiogenic syncope, a less serious non-fatal condition instead. As a result, Lewis began working out in preparation for returning for the 1994 season. Mudge was later cleared of any wrongdoing, and he insisted he had never authorized Lewis to resume workouts.

His no. 35 jersey was retired by the Celtics, making him one of only two Celtics to have a retired number without winning a championship with the team, the other player being Ed Macauley.

==Death==
On July 27, 1993, during off-season practice at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, Lewis suffered sudden cardiac death on the basketball court at the age of 27. Two Brandeis University police officers found Lewis and attempted to revive him using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful. One of the officers was James Crowley.

Lewis is buried in an unmarked grave in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.

His death was attributed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a structural heart defect that is the most common cause of death in young athletes.

===Aftermath===
Following Lewis&#x27; death, questions were raised about whether he had used cocaine, and whether cocaine use had contributed to his death. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that physicians &quot;suspected that cocaine killed Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis...but they were thwarted by actions of his family and a &#x27;dismissive&#x27; policy toward drugs by the NBA.&quot; The &quot;Journal&quot; added the following:

Whether Mr. Lewis died from a heart damaged by cocaine -- as many doctors suspected then and now -- cannot be definitively shown. What is evident: The official cause of death, a heart damaged by a common-cold virus, is a medically nonsensical finding by a coroner who was under intense pressure from the Lewis family to exclude any implication of drug use.

The Boston Celtics responded by expressing sadness about the &quot;vicious attack on Reggie Lewis and his family&quot; and threatening &quot;to file a $100 million lawsuit against the reporter, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and its parent company, Dow Jones and Co. Inc.&quot; Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a doctor who treated Lewis, was sued for malpractice in connection with Lewis&#x27; death; in written responses to questions from the attorneys for Donna Harris-Lewis, Mudge said that &quot;16 days before Lewis collapsed from a heart attack in 1993, he acknowledged having used cocaine, but said he had stopped.&quot; On the other hand, the doctor who performed the autopsy on Lewis testified that the scarring on his heart was inconsistent with cocaine use, and other doctors reached the same conclusion though they &quot;stopped short of saying he never used drugs.&quot; Also, Lewis&#x27;s heart tissue tested positive for adenovirus (a common virus that can cause a range of cold- or flu-like infections) during his autopsy.

After Lewis&#x27; death, the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center was opened in Roxbury, Boston. The center was funded partially by Lewis and has hosted major indoor track and field competitions, the Boston Indoor Games, home basketball games for Roxbury Community College, and Northeastern University track and field events.

On March 22, 1995, the Boston Celtics retired Lewis&#x27; jersey. Lewis had worn the number 35 for his entire career. During the ceremony, former teammate Dee Brown made a speech while two other former teammates, Sherman Douglas and Xavier McDaniel, held up Lewis&#x27; framed jersey.

Lewis&#x27; contract remained on the Celtics&#x27; salary cap for two full seasons after his death because at the time the NBA did not have a provision to void contracts if an active player died; NBA Commissioner David Stern suggested that the remaining NBA teams should approve an exemption for Lewis&#x27; contract, but the teams refused to do so. The rules have since been changed so that a similar case would result in the player&#x27;s contract being paid by league insurance.

== Literary works ==
He is prominent in the gasa and the sijo, which are forms of classical Korean poetry.

The following two poems are an exchange between Chŏng Ch&#x27;ŏl and the gisaeng Jinok. Chŏng is playing on Jinok&#x27;s name, which means Genuine Gem. First he calls her a gem (ok; 玉), then suggests she is an imitation (beon-ok; 燔玉) and finally finds her to be genuine (jin-ok; 眞玉). 
Jinok replies by playing on the name of Chŏng Ch&#x27;ŏl (鄭澈), first calling him iron (cheol; 鐵), then suggesting he might be false iron (seop-cheol; 攝鐵) and finally discovering he is genuine iron (jeong cheol; 正鐵). Unquestionably bawdy, this exchange is one of the finest examples of satire in sijo — a poetic form that placed high value on wit, double entendre and word play.
Other Works:

* &quot;Gwandong Byeolgok&quot; (The Song of the Sceneries of the Gwandong).
* &quot;Samiingok&quot; (Mindful of My Seemly Lord).

He was related to the House of Zhu, which was destroyed and executed by the new Qing dynasty. Fearing that he would also be purged and executed, he fled to a Buddhist temple and learned the teachings of Chan (Zen) Buddhism, becoming a monk for 30 years. 

He spent most of his early to mid-life in the Buddhist monkhood, returning to Nanchang when he was about fifty years old. He embarked on an artistic career soon after reentering secular life in 1680, producing works that featured his calligraphy, painting, and poetry. Most of the time, he painted simple subjects like flowers, plants, and animals and kept most of the given space empty. Toward the end of his life, he started painting more landscapes.

Some of his artwork were metaphors on the fall of the Ming dynasty and its failure after being destroyed by the Qing. His poems often included obscure references.

== Background ==
Bada Shanren lived during a tumultuous time in China, witnessing the Qing dynasty&#x27;s conquest of the Ming dynasty and execution of the House of Zhu. In the early 1600s, around the time Bada was born, the Ming government was disintegrating from factional conflict and rebellion. Facing a rebellion led by Li Zicheng in 1644, the last Ming emperor committed suicide. Wu Sangui asked for help from the Qing dynasty to crush Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebellion. The Qing then proceeded to seize Beijing, the imperial capital, and overthrew the Ming dynasty.

The Qing also defeated Ming loyalists, known as &quot;yimin&quot;. Zhu Youlang, the Prince of Gui, was crowned the Yongli emperor of the shortlived Southern Ming dynasty in 1647, centered around Yunnan with Kunming as its capital. In 1662, the Qing dynasty and Wu Sangui executed Zhu by strangling. Wu took control over Yunnan and established the short-lived Zhou dynasty. In 1673, Wu led the Revolt of the Three Feudatories against the new Qing government, but failed. The Qing successfully suppressed the rebellion in 1681.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and family ===
A descendant of a Ming imperial prince, Bada was born into a family of accomplished scholars and artists. His grandfather Zhu Duozheng was a poet, painter, calligrapher, and seal-carver, and his father was most likely Zhu Moujin, a painter and calligrapher mute since birth. Bada grew up under such artistic influences, studying poetry, calligraphy, and painting through his family&#x27;s works. Bada also received a classical education and passed the first-level test of the civil service examinations in the early 1640s. He married his first wife in his late teens, with whom he had at least one child.

=== Monastic life ===
After the Qing dynasty takeover of China, Bada fled to a Buddhist temple west of Nanchang, fearing for his safety given his connection to the House of Zhu, the Ming imperial family. The Qing dynasty had purged and executed Zhu Youlang and many other members of the Zhu family that ruled over the Ming. In 1645, he joined the monastic order at the age of nineteen. He spent about thirty years in the monkhood, studying the teachings of Chan Buddhism and the styles of past masters of calligraphy and painting.

=== Later life ===
Around 1680, Bada left the priesthood and refashioned himself as a professional painter and poet. He was dissatisfied with his monastic life all throughout the 1670s, during which he sought relationships outside the monastic order. He met the poet Qiu Lian and Qiu&#x27;s father-in-law Hu Yitang in the early 1670s. Despite his abandonment of priestly duties, Bada was still influenced by Buddhist teachings and remained close friends with several Buddhist monks.

The &quot;Portrait of Geshan&quot;, painted in 1674, reflects Bada&#x27;s refashioning from a monk to scholarly artist. According to Wang Fangyu, a scholar and collector of Bada Shanren&#x27;s work, the straw hat and loose, long robes make Bada look more like a scholar than a monk.

Bada also remarried soon after returning to Nanchang in 1680 but within a few years became single, dissatisfied with the marriage. For a while, his paintings reflected his unhappiness from the failed marriage. During this time, Bada also showed signs of eccentric behavior. Many believed he was feigning madness to eschew political involvement. From 1684 onward, Bada mostly stayed put in Nanchang, devoting himself to painting and calligraphy, and in the mid-1690s built a painting studio. With his scanty earnings, he lived in a small residential quarter in the southern part of Nanchang.

== Artistic pursuits ==

=== Calligraphy ===
Bada&#x27;s family members, including his grandfather and father, were calligraphers, whose works Bada studied from a young age. During his early years in the monastery, Bada practiced calligraphy by studying the works of Tang and Song calligraphers. Not yet settled on a style, Bada employed a wide range of script types, including the standard script &quot;kaishu&quot;, fully cursive script &quot;caoshu&quot;, and semicursive script &quot;xingshu&quot;. His standard scripts were modelled on the precisely executed &quot;kaishu&quot; script of Tang calligrapher Ouyang Xun. In his cursive and semicursive scripts, Bada emulated the swift and fluid brushstrokes of Ming calligrapher Dong Qichang, achieving the flying white calligraphic effect. Toward the end of his priesthood, Bada began to explore the exaggerated cursive script of Song calligrapher Huang Tingjian.

After leaving the monastery, Bada continued to study the Song calligrapher&#x27;s writing, for instance copying his essay titled “Praising the Virtue of Wine.” He rendered it in a style not identical to Huang Tingjian&#x27;s but combinative of various script types. His horizontal strokes were attenuated like Huang Tingjian&#x27;s, while his corner strokes were sharp like Ouyang Xun&#x27;s. Through the 1680s, Bada wrote in a style reflective of a balance between controlled and exaggerated forms. By 1689, he had developed his own style. Starting in 1690, Bada began to study the styles of Wei and Jin calligraphers like Wang Xizhi and incorporated them in his writing. His brushstrokes became rounded and centered, deviating from his earlier characteristic sharp strokes. Despite having established his own style, Bada remained devoted to the study of past calligraphic masters, including Wang Xizhi and the monk Huaisu, in the final years of his life.

=== Painting ===
Bada Shanren&#x27;s earliest extant paintings were produced during his years in the Buddhist monastery where he practiced painting as a hobby. He painted according to the literati tradition, studying the styles of past painters like Shen Zhou and Xu Wei. The subject of his paintings were simple objects like flowers, fruits, and vegetables. From 1681 to 1684, Bada treated painting as an outlet for his emotions, particularly his dissatisfaction with his second marriage. He expanded his repertoire of subjects to include animals like birds and fish in addition to flowers and vegetables. His earliest surviving landscape paintings are dated to this period. From 1684 to 1690, Bada most frequently painted myna birds, lotuses, and rocks. From 1690 to 1694, he shifted his attention to fish, which he often depicted alone at the center of an empty composition. Starting in 1693, landscapes became a major subject of his work.

The brushwork in Bada&#x27;s paintings closely mirrored his calligraphy. The paintings from his Buddhist years featured strokes consisting of thin and strong lines – reflective of a calligraphic style modeled on Ouyang Xun&#x27;s writing. His brushstrokes in the &quot;Ink Flowers&quot; handscroll, dated 1666, were rendered like the diagonal strokes of the &quot;kaishu&quot; script. He moved the brush as he did in his calligraphy: by first straightening the tip of the brush and moving slowly and then by lifting the brush and moving more rapidly in the flying white manner. Bada&#x27;s paintings from 1689 and 1690 mirrored his newly established style of calligraphy, featuring vigorous brushstrokes.

=== Poetry ===
Bada started to study poetry when he was seven. The classical education that he received in his youth paved way for his own poetic endeavors, helping him amass knowledge of a wide repertoire of Chinese literature and ancient characters. The poems that he wrote often included references to classical texts and obscure variants of characters, granting only those with the same background knowledge to decipher their meaning. Most of his poems were layered with metaphors and allusions. The obscurity of his language served reflected his familiarity with the Caodong sect of Buddhism. Bada&#x27;s poems often ended with imagery.

== Works ==

=== Overview ===
The vast majority of Bada Shanren&#x27;s works – 167 out of 179 – were produced between 1684 and 1705 during Bada&#x27;s sixties and seventies. His paintings were often accompanied by his poems featuring his calligraphy. Most of his works were uncolored; the few that were colored were mostly landscape paintings. While his works changed in subject matter and brushwork over time, they all bore a composition that showcased his experimental approach to pictorial space.

=== Media ===
Bada used ink and brush on paper to render his paintings, poetry, and calligraphy. He mostly painted on small album leaves in his early years and later preferred large hanging scrolls.

=== Early works (1659–1678) ===
Only eleven of Bada&#x27;s surviving works were produced during his years in the Buddhist temple. These include the &quot;Flower Studies&quot; album, the &quot;Vegetable and Fruits&quot; handscroll, the &quot;Lotus&quot; album, and the &quot;Ink Flowers&quot; handscroll. In most of his early works, his subjects were only partially represented at opposite corners of the canvas, the majority of which he left empty.

=== Works from 1680 to 1689 ===
Bada&#x27;s work during the 1680s were imbued with personal emotions and political sentiments. His animal subjects often wore human-like expressions. The angular brushstrokes in his works were achieved using the side hairs of the brush. Two of Bada&#x27;s rare colored works come from this period: the &quot;Lotus and Rock&quot; hanging scroll from 1686 and the &quot;Bamboo&quot; album leaf from 1689.  

=== Works from 1690 to 1705 ===
During this period, Bada painted subjects ranging from flowers, animals, to landscapes. His 1694 album titled &quot;Birds, Flowers, and Landscapes&quot; featured all three kinds of subjects. His works displayed a wide tonal range, and his brushwork was brought to the fore due to the large scale of the hanging scrolls on which he often painted. Many of his works from this period were dedicated to his monk friends.

==== Anwan Album (1694) ====
The &quot;Anwan&quot; Album of 1694 was produced when the artist was nearly seventy years old. The sixth leaf of the album is a painting of a mandarin fish. The fish stares up at Bada&#x27;s poem on the upper left-hand corner. The first two lines of the poem allude to a story written in the &quot;Shishuo xinyu&quot;, a book referenced by many of Bada&#x27;s later works. In the story, Xie Wan elaborates on the meaning of the name Qu’e, referring to the Daoist concept of “qu ze quan,” which means “to bend is to be preserved whole.”

Bada&#x27;s contemporaries would have been familiar with the mythical story behind the name of Lake Qu’e, centered around the unrightful dethronement of an emperor. They would have thus seen the Qu’e in Bada&#x27;s poem as a metaphor for the fall of the weak Ming dynasty.

Translation of the poem on the upper left:

“Left and right, what is this water?

It is named Qu’e.

I go on seeking the place where the source enters,

Perhaps there will be many beautiful clouds at sunset”

== Names, seals, and signatures ==
The names which Bada used in his seals and signatures have been referenced to determine the chronology of his oeuvre. Like most literati painters, Bada had multiple style and poetic names that each symbolized a virtue, ability, desire, or event. In his artwork, he used these names in lieu of his formal, or assigned, names.

The twenty different style and poetic names which Bada used at distinct stages of his life reflect his changing self-image. From 1653 to 1680, during his time as a Buddhist monk, he most often used his Buddhist name Chuanqi and style name Geshan and was addressed as Xuege, or Abbot Xuege, by his friends. After leaving the priesthood, from 1680 to 1684, he invented new names while keeping the name Geshan. Most of his new names contained the word lu, meaning donkey, a condescending descriptor for a Buddhist monk. From 1684 onward, Bada settled on the name Bada Shanren. A colophon to the &quot;Nanchang xianzhi&quot; (&quot;Annals of Nanchang&quot;) explains the story behind Bada&#x27;s adoption of this name. According to the colophon, Bada took this name from &quot;Ba da renjuejing&quot; (&quot;Sutra of the Eight Great Human Realizations&quot;), made by Yuan painter Zhao Mengfu.

Like other late Ming painters of his time, Bada carved seals and incorporated them in his art. He came up with multiple seal designs for some of his names. For instance, eleven different seals were found for the name Bada Shanren. As in his paintings, Bada experimented with space by leaving certain parts of the seal empty. The parts void of text were often two opposite corners of the seal. Bada further experimented with the composition by toying with the characters, splitting a character into two or combining two into one.

In addition to carving seals, Bada often signed his work in a wide range of styles ranging from standard cursive, expressive cursive, to seal script. The names he used in his signatures roughly matched the names he used on his seals, while some names occurred only in his signatures. He sometimes changed the form of his signature for the same name. For his signature Chuanqi, which he used from 1659 to 1676, he changed the character for &quot;qi&quot; in 1665. Most of Bada&#x27;s work from the last twenty years of his life bore the signature Bada Shanren, written either in seal script or cursive script. The album &quot;Huangting neijing jing&quot; (&quot;Scripture of the Inner Radiances of the Yellow Court&quot;) featured the earliest known instance of the Bada Shanren signature.  

== Modern copies ==
In the 20th century, copies of Bada Shanren&#x27;s art were made and studied by Chinese artists such as Qi Baishi, Wu Changshi, and Zhang Daqian.

Zhang Daqian was a twentieth-century Chinese painter who made copies of Bada&#x27;s work. Zhang&#x27;s copies can be distinguished from Bada&#x27;s real works through an examination of brushstrokes. Zhang&#x27;s 1930s reproductions of Bada&#x27;s midlife work featured softer and more rounded brushstrokes compared to the sharp, sideways brushstrokes characteristic of Bada&#x27;s work.

== Exhibitions ==
In 1986, an exhibition and symposium were held in Nanchang, Bada&#x27;s childhood home, in honor of his 360th birthday. In 1991, the Yale University Art Gallery held a major exhibition of the artist&#x27;s work.

Owning the largest collection of Bada Shanren&#x27;s work outside of China, the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. held multiple exhibitions on Bada Shanren in the 2000s. In 2003, it held an exhibition titled &quot;In Pursuit of Heavenly Harmony: Painting and Calligraphy by Bada Shanren&quot; along with the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery which mounted an exhibition titled &quot;After the Madness: The Secular Life, Art, and Imitation of Bada Shanren&quot;. From 2015 to 2016, the Freer Gallery displayed fifty-one of Bada&#x27;s works in an exhibition titled &quot;Enigmas: The Art of Bada Shanren (1626-1705)&quot;. In 2023 several of Bada Shanren&#x27;s works, including his handscroll masterpiece &quot;Flowers on a River,&quot; were featured in an exhibition titled, &quot;Flowers on a River: The Art of Chinese Flower-and-Bird Painting, 1368-1911&quot; at the China Institute in New York City. A reduced version of this exhibition later went on to show at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.

<doc id="656829" wikidata="Q1429772" url="?curid=656829" title="Submarine patent">
<text>A submarine patent is a patent whose issuance and publication are intentionally delayed by the applicant for an artificially long pendency, which can be several years, or a decade. Analogous to a submarine, submarine patents could remain &quot;under water&quot; for long periods until they &quot;emerged&quot;, surprising the relevant market and potential infringers. Persons or companies making use of submarine patents are sometimes referred to as patent pirates.

Typically, the submarine patent strategy requires a patent system where patent applications are not automatically published, and the patent term is measured from the grant date rather than the priority or filing date. In the United States, patent applications filed before November 2000 were not published and remained secret until they were granted. 

The phrase is occasionally used more generally for any patent used in patent ambush.

Submarine patents were criticized because they allowed inventors to delay the publication and issuance of their patents, creating uncertainty in the market and enabling them to enforce unexpected claims against competitors long after the technology had been widely adopted.

==Causes==
After the United States signed the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO in 1995, the standard patent term of 20 years under United States patent law has been measured from the original filing or priority date, rather than (as was previously the case) the date of issuance. This has significantly reduced the previous potential for submarine patent practices. Some submarine patents may also result from pre-1995 filings that have yet to be granted and will remain unpublished until issuance. Submarine patents are also weaker in jurisdictions such as US Federal Courts, in which they may be considered to be a procedural &quot;laches&quot;: a delay in enforcing one&#x27;s rights that causes those rights to be lost.

In the past, when the life of a U.S. patent was 17 years from the date it was granted, submarine patents could issue decades after the initial filing date. Therefore, an applicant for a U.S. patent could benefit by delaying the issuance, and thus expiration date, of a patent through the simple, but relatively costly, expedient of filing a succession of continuation applications. Some submarine patents emerged as much as 40 years after the date of filing of the corresponding application.
During the extended prosecution period the claims of the patent could be modified to more closely match whatever technology or products had become the industry standard.

Prior to changes in US patent law in 1995 and 1999, the content of patent applications was kept secret during the patent approval phase. Currently, the majority of U.S. patent applications are published within 18 months of the filing date (35 U.S.C. 122). However, the applicant can explicitly certify that they do not intend to file a corresponding patent outside the U.S. at the time they file the patent, and keep the application secret. The applicant can change their mind within the first year, but the application is then published. For continuation applications which claim priority to a previously filed application, the publication is six months after the new filing date. The changes to U.S. patent law that introduced publication at 18 months also changed the duration of the patent to 20 years from the filing date of the earliest patent application in any chain of continuation patent applications. As a result, there is little benefit in postponing the grant of the patent. The enforceable life of the patent can no longer be shifted into the period when a technology has become more widely adopted, and the patent applicant must abandon the chance of foreign patent protection if he is to maintain patent secrecy beyond the 18-month period. In a 2006 report the National Academy of Sciences has recommended that &quot;in all cases, applications should be published during patent examinations&quot;.

== Notable submarine patent owners ==
A notable case of a single submarine patent is the George B. Selden automobile design, applied for in 1879 and issued in 1895, which led to the creation of the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers.

Gilbert Hyatt was awarded a patent claiming an invention pre-dating both Texas Instruments and Intel, describing a &quot;microcontroller&quot;. The patent was later invalidated, but not before substantial royalties were paid out. He also still has two even wider patents still pending, also dating from the same period.

Jerome H. Lemelson filed many applications that became submarine patents, including applications related to pop up in camcorders, VCRs, bar code readers, automated teller machines, machine vision systems, among many others. He and his heirs have collected over $1.3 billion (U.S.) in royalties. In 2004 Lemelson&#x27;s estate was defeated in a notable court case involving Symbol Technologies and Cognex Corporation, which sought (and received) a ruling that 76 claims under Lemelson&#x27;s machine-vision patents were unenforceable. The plaintiff companies, with the support of dozens of industry supporters, spent millions on this landmark case. The ruling was upheld on September 9, 2005 by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under the doctrine of &quot;laches&quot;, citing &quot;unreasonably long … delays in prosecution.&quot; Lemelson&#x27;s estate appealed for a review by the full circuit en banc. On November 16, 2005, the full court declined to review the case, and, citing &quot;prejudice to the public as a whole&quot;, extended the original unenforceability ruling to all claims under the patents in question.

<text>The Illinizas are a pair of volcanic mountains that are located in the north of Latacunga, Cotopaxi, Ecuador. They are located in the Illinizas Ecological Reserve (). These twin mountains are separated by a saddle that is about a kilometer long. The peaks are among the highest in Ecuador, with Illiniza Sur standing slightly taller than Illiniza Norte, its northern counterpart, at 5245 metres and 5126 metres respectively.

Most guidebooks (for example, &quot;Lonely Planet Ecuador, Ecuador: A Climbing Guide&quot;) spell the mountain with only one &quot;l&quot; as in &quot;Iliniza&quot;. The name Illinizas is derived from the Kunza words for &quot;masculine hill.&quot;

Whilst Illiniza Sur (the southern peak) is a more difficult climb due to its glacial nature, Illiniza Norte requires some climbing expertise, and may be climbed as a trekking peak. A guide is still recommended, however, as the path becomes hard to navigate as it approaches the summit.

There is a rustic refuge located between the north and south peaks. It can be reached in one hour by car from El Chaupi, followed by a three-hour climb. The refuge has gas stoves, pots and pans and bunk beds. It is necessary to bring warm sleeping bags and food, but water is available to be boiled.

The Englishman Edward Whymper tried and failed twice to make the first ascent of Iliniza Sur. It was climbed for the first time in 1880 by his two Italian guides Jean-Antoine Carrel and Louis Carrel. The first ascent of Iliniza Norte was made in 1912 by the Ecuadorians Nicolás Martínez and Alejandro Villavicencio.

<doc id="656843" wikidata="Q106119" url="?curid=656843" title="RAF Northolt">
<text>Royal Air Force Northolt or more simply RAF Northolt is a Royal Air Force station in South Ruislip, from Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon, western Greater London, England, approximately north of Heathrow Airport. As London VIP Airport, the station handles many private civil flights (private planes of up to 29 passengers) in addition to Air Force flights. 

Northolt has one runway in operation, spanning , with a grooved asphalt surface. This airport is used for government and VIP transport to and from London.

Northolt predates the establishment of the Royal Air Force by almost three years, having opened in May 1915, making it the oldest RAF base. Originally established for the Royal Flying Corps, it has the longest history of continuous use of any RAF airfield. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the station was the first to take delivery of the Hawker Hurricane. The station played a key role during the Battle of Britain, when fighters from several of its units, including No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron, engaged enemy aircraft as part of the defence of London. It became the first base to have squadrons operating Supermarine Spitfire aircraft within German airspace.

During the construction of Heathrow Airport, Northolt was used for commercial civil flights, becoming the busiest airport in Europe for a time and a major base for British European Airways. More recently the station has become the hub of British military flying operations in the London area. Northolt has been extensively redeveloped since 2006 to accommodate these changes, becoming home to the British Forces Post Office, which moved to a newly constructed headquarters and sorting office on the site. Units currently based at RAF Northolt are No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron, the King&#x27;s Colour Squadron, 600 (City of London) Squadron, No 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit, the Air Historical Branch and the Central Band of the RAF.

== History ==

===Construction===
Following Louis Blériot&#x27;s first flight across the English Channel in 1909, the British Army considered the necessity of defending the United Kingdom from a future air attack. By May 1910, Claude Grahame-White and other aviation pioneers were flying from the flat areas around Ruislip, although they soon sought an aerodrome for London, which was eventually built at Hendon. A proposal was made in 1912 for the area around where RAF Northolt now stands to be developed as &quot;Harrow Aerodrome&quot;. The company established to develop the site was listed on the London Stock Exchange but the idea did not progress any further.

The outbreak of the First World War necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major Sefton Brancker of the War Office conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in Ickenham, and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station; in January 1915 the government requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land on the wrong side of the railway line, including the old Hill Farm.
Construction of the new aerodrome, to be named &quot;RFC Military School, Ruislip&quot;, began in January 1915. It opened on 3 May 1915, becoming known as Northolt and home to No. 4 Reserve Aeroplane Squadron which relocated from Farnborough. Most early RAF airfields were named after the nearest railway station, in this case Northolt Junction, later named Northolt Halt and now South Ruislip station; so the airfield became &quot;Northolt&quot; despite being in neighbouring South Ruislip. In the same year the airfield was extended westwards, and aircraft began flying sorties in defence of London against Zeppelin raids. No. 18 Squadron was formed in the same month as Northolt and equipped with Bleriot Experimental biplanes, whose slow speed led to heavy losses in combat with the German Fliegertruppe.

In 1916, No. 43 Squadron was formed under the command of Major Sholto Douglas. Aircraft equipping the squadron included the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, built by the Fairey Aviation company, then in Hayes. The Strutter made its first test flight from Northolt in 1916 with Harry Hawker at the controls. Fairey conducted test flights at Northolt from 1917 until 1928 when the Air Ministry gave the company notice to vacate the aerodrome. Flights later resumed from the Great West Aerodrome owned by Fairey in Harmondsworth, which was eventually developed as Heathrow Airport. No. 43 Squadron went on to fly sorties over France from 17 January 1917, taking part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge between 4 and 8 April 1917.

No. 600 Squadron and No. 601 Squadron of the fledgling Royal Auxiliary Air Force were formed at Northolt in 1925 under the command of Squadron Leader Lord Edward Grosvenor. Both squadrons were deployed to RAF Hendon in 1927, although 600 Squadron returned in 1939. The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII and subsequently the Duke of Windsor, made his first flight in a Bristol F.2 Fighter from Northolt on 27 April 1929.

===Second World War and the Battle of Britain===
Northolt became an active base during the Second World War for Royal Air Force and Polish Air Force squadrons in their defence of the United Kingdom. It was the first RAF station to operate the Hawker Hurricane, with No. 111 Squadron receiving the first four aircraft in December 1937, and reaching its full complement by February 1938. In the lead-up to war, the RAF implemented a policy of adding concrete runways to important airfields; by 1939 Northolt had a new concrete runway. Later in 1939 RAF Hendon became one of its satellite airfields. Polish pilots were taught English at RAF Uxbridge, where they also practised formation flying using tricycles with radios, compasses and speed indicators.

On 15 September 1940 during the Battle of Britain, No. 1 Squadron RCAF, No. 229 Squadron, No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron, No. 504 Squadron, and part of No. 264 Squadron were based at the station, all under the control of No. 11 Group RAF, headquartered at RAF Uxbridge. All flew Hawker Hurricanes except No. 264 Squadron&#x27;s contingent, which operated the Boulton Paul Defiant. During the Battle of Britain, Polish 303 Squadron was the highest scoring Hurricane Sqd in Fighter Command, with its Czech pilot Sergeant Josef František becoming the fourth highest scoring RAF &quot;ace&quot; during the battle. The Luftwaffe bombed the airfield in August 1940 as well as other sector airfields in the area, including Biggin Hill, Hornchurch and North Weald, as part of a concentrated effort against the airfields and sector stations of No. 11 Group RAF. A total of 4,000 bombs were recorded as falling within two miles (3 km) of the airfield over a fifteen-month period, although only two were recorded as hitting the airfield itself. Under the leadership of the station commander, Group Captain Stanley Vincent, the airfield was camouflaged to resemble civil housing. Vincent had been concerned that camouflaging the airfield as open land would look too suspicious from the air; Northolt was surrounded by housing and so a large open area would draw attention. A fake stream was painted across the main runway while the hangars were decorated to look like houses and gardens. The result was so effective that pilots flying to Northolt from other airfields often struggled to find it.

Thirty Allied airmen including servicemen from Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, New Zealand, Poland and the United Kingdom were killed flying from RAF Northolt during the Battle of Britain, of whom ten were Polish. The Polish War Memorial dedicated to all Polish airmen who lost their lives during the Second World War, stands near the southeastern corner of the airfield. Its name is also commemorated at the adjacent eponymous junction on Western Avenue.

Squadrons based at RAF Northolt during the battle shot down a total of 148 Luftwaffe aircraft and damaged 52. A further 25 were claimed by pilots and recorded as &quot;probables&quot;. Group Captain Vincent became one of the few RAF airmen to shoot down an enemy aircraft in both World Wars. He was a long-serving RAF man who had claimed an aerial victory over the Western Front in the First World War. By the time of the Battle of Britain he was too old for operational flying. Nevertheless, he took to the skies during one raid and brought down a German aircraft.

After the Battle of Britain, the station remained a base for daytime fighter operations, with No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron, No. 229 Squadron and No. 615 Squadron all arriving before 3 November 1940. No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron and No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron later joined No. 303 during 1941 to form the No. 1 Polish Fighter Wing. Polish Fighter Squadrons based at Northolt in 1942 took part in Operation Jubilee (the raid on Dieppe) on 19 August alongside Nos. 302 and 308 from nearby RAF Heston. Reconnaissance squadrons No. 16 Squadron and No. 140 Squadron operating Supermarine Spitfires and de Havilland Mosquitos moved to Northolt in 1944. No. 69 Squadron with their Vickers Wellingtons modified for photographic reconnaissance arrived later. All three reconnaissance squadrons were combined to form No. 34 (PR) Wing.

In 1943, the station became the first to fly sorties using Supermarine Spitfires (Mk IXs) in German airspace in support of bomber operations. On 25 March, RAF Ferry Command became RAF Transport Command and thereafter used Northolt as a London base for the transfer of new aircraft from factories to airfields. Runway 26/08 was extended in February that year to accommodate the larger transport aircraft required by the Command. Northolt continued as a Sector Fighter Station until February 1944. As a result of this and the new larger runway, the smaller 02/20 runway closed in April 1944.

RAF Northolt became home to Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s personal aircraft, a modified Douglas C-54 Skymaster, in June 1944. The aircraft was used to fly him to meetings with other Allied leaders. Between 20 and 21 July 1944, a converted Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber named &quot;Marco Polo&quot; made the first non-stop intercontinental flight, flying from London to Washington, DC, then returning to Northolt from La Guardia Airport within 18 hours. In November of the same year, an Avro York flew non-stop from Northolt to Cairo in 10 hours and 25 minutes. A new runway, 31/13, was surveyed the following month and built in March 1946.

===Post-war civil and military use===
Starting in 1946 the airfield was used by civil aviation during the construction of nearby Heathrow Airport. During this period, Northolt became a major base for British European Airways (BEA), which used the nearby Bourne School as its headquarters. Other airlines including Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Scandinavian Airlines System and Swissair used the airfield for scheduled services across Europe.

In December 1946, after taking off during a heavy snowstorm, a Douglas Dakota 3 operated by Railway Air Services, flying from Northolt to Glasgow, crashed onto the roof of a house in South Ruislip. All the crew and passengers escaped unharmed by climbing through the loft of the house and leaving via the front door. No residents were injured, even though the owner of the house next door was standing at her front gate when the aircraft came down. The owners of the house had not moved in at the time of the crash as they were due to be married a few days later. The house was later named &quot;Dakota Rest&quot;, and still stands today.

In June 1951, BEA introduced helicopter services to Hay Mills Rotor Station in Birmingham and to London Heathrow, operated by a pair of Westland-Sikorsky S51s.
During 1952 a total of 50,000 air movements were recorded, making the airfield the busiest in Europe. By then the only scheduled airlines were BEA and Aer Lingus. The RAF maintained a presence throughout its use by civil airlines, making it the longest continuously used airfield in the history of the Royal Air Force. En route from Northolt to Dublin, on 10 January 1952, a civil Douglas C-47 Skytrain operated by Aer Lingus and named &quot;St. Kevin&quot; flew into an area of extreme turbulence caused by a mountain wave generated by Snowdon. As a result, the plane crashed into a peat bog near Llyn Gwynant in Snowdonia, killing all 20 passengers and three crew in the company&#x27;s first fatal accident.

Civil flights ceased when the central area at Heathrow opened in 1954 with Northolt reverting to sole military use in May that year. Northolt&#x27;s operations became constrained by its proximity to the new much larger civil airport at Heathrow. No. 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit (AIDU) moved to the station in 1956 from the neighbouring RAF West Ruislip station. The unit had been established in 1953 to provide information on airfields, communications and navigational aids for the benefit of aircraft safety. AIDU was originally under the command of RAF Transport Command but this was moved to Home Command in March 1957.

On 1 June 1960, an Avro Anson aircraft suffered engine failure soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed on top of the nearby Express Dairies plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a Pan Am Boeing 707, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board. A Lufthansa Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as instrument landing systems (ILS) and the global positioning system (GPS) were available, the letters &quot;NO&quot; (for Northolt) and &quot;LH&quot; (for Heathrow) were painted on two gasometers on the approach to each airfield, one at Southall for the approach to Heathrow&#x27;s diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt&#x27;s runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors. By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remained in force in 2008.
Northolt received its first gate guardian, a Spitfire F.Mk 22, in September 1963. Purchased from the RAF in 1969 for use in the film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, it was replaced by a Spitfire Mk XVI on 2 June 1970. This aircraft remained at the station until its removal on 8 September 1989 for restoration to full flying condition. The Kermit Weeks&#x27; Fantasy of Flight Museum in Polk City, Florida, purchased the aircraft whereupon the station received a fibreglass replica of a Spitfire Mk IX as a replacement.

Servicing of No. 32 Squadron passed from the RAF to the private company Fields Aviation Services in April 1985, then to Lovaux Aircraft Servicing in 1990. In 1991, the Station Flight was established, taking delivery of two Britten-Norman Islanders in December which entered service in January 1992. No. 32 Squadron celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 1991, at a time when personnel became involved in operations during the Gulf War. No. 38 Group RAF assumed control of RAF Northolt on 2 November 1992 following a wider restructuring of the RAF. On 16 December 1994, the new southside Operations Building opened, replacing the old Northolt Airport Terminal building. With the reorganisation of RAF Strike Command on 1 April 2000, No. 38 Group was disbanded and Northolt came under the control of No. 2 Group RAF.

===Modern use===
In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet operated by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and collided with a van heading eastward on the A40 Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority&#x27;s Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that both the crew&#x27;s lack of understanding English and military air traffic control procedures had contributed significantly to the crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt&#x27;s redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed at each end of the runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another business jet or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flight paths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually progressed no further.
Much media attention focused on the airfield when the body of Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived there from Villacoublay airfield, in Paris, France, after her death in a car crash in the city on 31 August 1997. The Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron, then based at neighbouring RAF Uxbridge, acted as the bearer party, while the flight was met by the prime minister Tony Blair, the lord chamberlain, Lord Lieutenant of Greater London, secretary of state for defence, the RAF Northolt station commander and the RAF chaplain-in-chief.

Attention was high again in 2001 when Ronnie Biggs, the seriously ill, fugitive Great Train Robber, was flown from Brazil to the airfield to be arrested by waiting police officers. Biggs had escaped from custody in 1965; upon his return he was taken to Belmarsh Prison to complete the remainder of his sentence.

Since 1 June 1998, station commanders have served as aides-de-camp to the Queen. The station received the Freedom of Entry to the London Borough of Hillingdon on 11 May 2000. This allowed military personnel to march through the borough in full uniform, an honour granted by the council in light of 2000 being the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and the 85th anniversary of the opening of RAF Northolt. The neighbouring RAF Uxbridge station had received the same honour in 1960.

The remains of a Hawker Hurricane flown by Flying Officer Ludwik Witold Paszkiewicz, the first pilot in No. 303 Squadron to shoot down an enemy aircraft, were donated to the station in June 2008. During the Battle of Britain, Paszkiewicz became a flying ace and received the Distinguished Flying Cross after shooting down six aircraft. He was killed in action over Borough Green in Kent on 27 September 1940. No. 303 Squadron recorded its 100th kill less than a month after commencing operations. Polish pilot Squadron Leader Franciszek Kornicki, who saw wartime service at RAF Northolt, was reunited with the Supermarine Spitfire he had flown at a special ceremony in September 2010.

An additional memorial to British, Polish, Australian and New Zealand aircrew killed during the Battle of Britain was unveiled in September 2010. In October that year, the hangar which had housed Churchill&#x27;s personal aircraft, the former Squadron Watch office, and the Operations Block were given Grade II listed building status. The Operations Block was a prototype of the &quot;Dowding system&quot;, which facilitated the chain of command&#x27;s issuance of orders for the interception of enemy aircraft and a scheme used for the first time during the Battle of Britain. Prior to the listing, the block was renamed the Sir Keith Park Building on 20 September in honour of the former No. 11 Group RAF commander who had also served as station commander at Northolt between 1931 and 1932. RAF Northolt is the only airfield used in the Battle of Britain still operated by the RAF.
In January 2012 it was reported that the future of the station was under review by the Ministry of Defence as part of efforts to reduce defence spending. A proposed use has been as a satellite of Heathrow Airport, although a Ministry of Defence spokesman described that as unlikely.

Four Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft arrived at the station from RAF Coningsby on 2 May 2012 to take part in a security exercise as part of preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics. During the Games, the aircraft were deployed to the station to provide air superiority protection for London, in conjunction with other security measures by the British Armed Forces. The presence of the aircraft during the Olympics became the first time fighter aircraft had been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. The Typhoons left Northolt on 16 August following the conclusion of the Olympics.

The overnight base of the London Air Ambulance moved to RAF Northolt from Denham Aerodrome in February 2013. The flying time from the station to its daytime base at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel is three minutes shorter than from Denham, which also provides savings for the Air Ambulance charity.

In April 2013 the Ministry of Defence announced a proposal to increase the number of private flights from 7,000 to 12,000 per year as part of plans to increase the income generated by the airfield. The number of flights would be limited to 40 per day, and the increase would be phased in over three years to 2016.

On 13 September 2022, Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coffin arrived at Northolt from Edinburgh Airport, after which it was taken by road to Buckingham Palace. The flight was welcomed by a party including the Prime Minister Liz Truss and the Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace. An RAF bearer party formed by The Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron transferred the coffin from the aircraft to the hearse.

===Project MoDEL redevelopment===

The Ministry of Defence launched Project MoDEL (Ministry of Defence Estates London) in 2006 to consolidate many of its London-based operations at RAF Northolt. Under the project, RAF Bentley Priory, RAF Uxbridge, RAF West Ruislip, RAF Eastcote and the Inglis Barracks in Mill Hill were all closed between 2006 and 2010 with any remaining units transferring to Northolt. The Air Historical Branch, originally established in 1919 to provide a record of air activity during the First World War, was also relocated to RAF Northolt from RAF Bentley Priory in 2008 as part of this project. As a result, the station has been extensively redeveloped with new facilities to support these operations.

The statue, Letter from Home, of a First World War soldier reading a letter was moved from outside Inglis Barracks in Mill Hill to RAF Northolt in June 2007. It is a replica of the statue at Paddington Station and was first unveiled in 1982. Following the relocation of the British Forces Post Office and Defence Courier Service from Mill Hill, a new headquarters and main sorting facility were built for their use which opened in November 2007. New hangar facilities for the use of No. 32 Squadron were also constructed, along with new personnel accommodation.

The original 1920s Officers&#x27; Mess was refurbished as part of the work, which also saw the relocation of the replica Supermarine Spitfire gate guardian to the passenger terminal, and the unveiling of a new replica Hawker Hurricane gate guardian near the eastern station entrance in September 2010, commemorating the aircrew based at Northolt who had fought in the Battle of Britain.

Upon the closure of RAF Uxbridge, control of the Battle of Britain Bunker passed to RAF Northolt to allow continued public visits. In December 2010 it was agreed that the South Hillingdon branch of the St. John Ambulance service would move from its existing base in RAF Uxbridge to new premises at Northolt.

The station&#x27;s new police dog section, featuring kennels and a quarantine building, opened in February 2012, marking the completion of building work.

=== Runway resurfacing ===
In October 2018, a £23 million contract to resurface Northolt&#x27;s runway was awarded to Lagan Aviation &amp; Infrastructure as the main contractor, and Mott MacDonald in a support role.

The runway closed and work began on 15 April 2019. No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron fixed wing flight relocated to RAF Benson in Oxfordshire, whilst civilian aircraft used alternative civilian airports. Helicopters continued to operate from Northolt during the construction work. The first landing on the resurfaced runway was on 9 October 2019. The runway underwent testing as part of the recommissioning process before officially reopening on 1 November 2019 with commercial operations scheduled to resume on 11 November 2019.

==In popular culture==
As it is near several film studios including those at Pinewood, the airfield has been used to represent outside locations in a number of feature films. Scenes of the James Bond films &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;Octopussy&quot; were all filmed at Northolt, and station personnel served as extras in the &quot;Octopussy&quot; hangar fly-through stunt scene. The mini-series &quot;The Winds of War&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot; and the BBC shows &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; have all used Northolt to represent various fictional airfields. In early 2010 the station was used for action scenes in the final episode of the conclusion of the BBC series of &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;.

<doc id="656848" wikidata="Q4968075" url="?curid=656848" title="Brillo Pad">
<text>Brillo is a trade name for a scouring pad, used for cleaning dishes, and made from steel wool filled with soap. The concept was patented in 1913, at a time when aluminium pots and pans were replacing cast iron in the kitchen; the new cookware blackened easily. The company&#x27;s website states the name Brillo is from the Latin word for &quot;bright&quot;, although no such word exists in Latin. In Spanish the word &quot;brillo&quot; means the noun &quot;shine&quot;; however, German, Italian, French, and English do have words for &quot;shine&quot; or &quot;bright&quot; beginning with &quot;brill-&quot; deriving from Latin words for beryl.

==History==
In the early 1900s, in New York, an unnamed cookware peddler and his brother-in-law, an unnamed jeweller, were working on a solution to clean blackened cookware. Using jewellers&#x27; rouge, with soap and fine steel wool from Germany, they developed a method to scour the backsides of cooking utensils when they began to blacken. The method worked and the peddler added this new product, soap with steel wool, into his line of goods for sale.

Demand for the steel wool, copper spun and soap with jewellers&#x27; rouge increased quickly. The peddler and the jeweller decided to patent the product. Because they lacked the money to pay for legal services, they offered New York attorney Milton Loeb an interest in their business. Loeb accepted and in 1913, he secured a patent for the product under the name Brillo. The partnership formed between the peddler, the jeweller and the attorney became known as the Brillo Manufacturing Company, with headquarters and production operations in New York City.

By 1917, the company was selling packaged boxes of six pads, with a cake of soap included. During World War I, it helped with needed efforts of field operations. In 1921, the company moved its production facility to London, Ohio. It was only in the 1930s that soap was contained within the pad. 

The company merged with Purex Industries in 1962. The Dial Corporation acquired Purex Industries in 1985. Church and Dwight acquired the Brillo business from Dial in 1997.

In 2010, Armaly Brands of Walled Lake, Michigan, primarily a manufacturer of sponges, purchased the Brillo business from Church &amp; Dwight. At that time there were about 50 employees, down from a high of about 150 in the 1990s.

==Production==
Brillo is manufactured in London, Ohio.

==Brillo Basics==
In December 2019, Innovative Brands, a division of International Wholesale, agreed to a licensing agreement with Armaly Brands to launch Brillo Basics, a line of household cleaning products.

==In art==
The most famous example of Brillo in pop art is works by Andy Warhol in 1964. Warhol did artwork on boxes with the 1960s Brillo logo.

In 1970 Harlan Ellison and Ben Bova published a short story about a robot policeman titled &quot;Brillo&quot;. The title was a pun by Bova as a robot policeman could be referred to as metal fuzz.

<text>Mob Rules is the tenth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in November 1981. It followed 1980&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, and was the second album to feature lead singer Ronnie James Dio and the first with drummer Vinny Appice. Neither musician would appear on a Black Sabbath studio album again until the 1992 album &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;.

Produced and engineered by Martin Birch, the album received a remastered Deluxe Edition release in 2010 and an expanded edition in 2021.

==Recording==
The first new recording Black Sabbath made after the &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; album was a version of the title track &quot;The Mob Rules&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. The track &quot;E5150&quot; is also heard in the film but not included on the soundtrack. According to guitarist Tony Iommi&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven &amp; Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;, the band began writing and rehearsing songs for &quot;Mob Rules&quot; at a rented house in Toluca Lake in Los Angeles. Initially the band hoped to record in their own studio to save money and actually purchased a sound desk; but, according to Iommi, &quot;We just couldn&#x27;t get a guitar sound. We tried it in the studio. We tried it in the hallway. We tried it everywhere but it just wasn&#x27;t working. We&#x27;d bought a studio and it wasn&#x27;t working!&quot; The band eventually recorded the album at the Record Plant in Los Angeles.

&quot;Mob Rules&quot; was the first Sabbath album to feature Vinny Appice on drums, who had replaced original member Bill Ward in the middle of the &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; tour. Asked by Joe Matera in 2007 if working with a new drummer was jarring after so many years, bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler replied, &quot;No, because Vinny was a big fan of the band and loved Bill&#x27;s playing. Bill was one of his favourite drummers and so he knew all his parts and my bass parts and he adjusted accordingly to everybody in the band. He was brilliant. He came in and totally filled in Bill&#x27;s shoes.&quot;

In an interview for the concert film &quot;Neon Nights: 30 Years of Heaven and Hell&quot;, Butler cites &quot;The Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; as his favourite &quot;Mob Rules&quot; track because &quot;it gave me a chance to experiment with some bass effects&quot;. The album was the last time the band worked with producer and engineer Martin Birch, who went on to work with Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992. Iommi explained to &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1992, &quot;We were all going through a lot of problems at that time, most of it related to drugs. Even the producer, Martin Birch, was having drug problems, and it hurt the sound of that record. Once that happens to your producer, you’re really screwed.&quot;

&quot;Mob Rules&quot; would be singer Ronnie James Dio&#x27;s second and final studio recording with Black Sabbath until the &quot;Mob Rules&quot;-era line-up reunited for 1992&#x27;s &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;. The seeds of discontent appear to have sprouted when Dio was offered a solo deal by Warner Brothers, with Iommi stating in his memoir, &quot;After the (&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;) record became such a great success, Warner Brothers extended the contract at the same time, offering Ronnie a solo deal. That felt a bit odd to us, because we were a band and we didn&#x27;t want to separate anybody.&quot; Dio confided in an interview on the &quot;Neon Nights: 30 Years of Heaven and Hell&quot; DVD that the recording of &quot;Mob Rules&quot; was far more difficult for him than &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; because &quot;we approached the writing very much differently than the first one. Geezer had gone so we wrote in a very controlled environment in a living room with little amplifiers. And with &quot;Mob Rules&quot; we hired a studio, turned up as loud as possible and smashed through it all. So it made for a different kind of an attitude&quot;.

Vinny Appice stated in a 2021 interview with Pariah Burke that the writing for the album was largely a collaborative process done through jam sessions. He stated, &quot;We put [songs] together by jamming and playing together and putting ideas in the pot. It&#x27;s a natural way of doing it and it works really well for us. That&#x27;s how we did all the big albums like &quot;Mob Rules&quot; and &quot;Holy Diver&quot;. Nobody came in with a song.”

Iommi reflected to &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1992, &quot;&quot;Mob Rules&quot; was a confusing album for us. We started writing songs differently for some reason, and ended up not using a lot of really great material. That line-up was really great, and the whole thing fell apart for very silly reasons — we were all acting like children.&quot; The major problem, noted by Mick Wall in his book &quot;Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe&quot;, was that the balance of power within the band had shifted: &quot;With Bill and Ozzy happy to leave the heavy lifting to Tony and Geezer, in terms of songwriting, coming into the studio only when they were called, even as their flair deserted them over the final, dismal Ozzy-era albums, at least everybody knew where they stood. Now, though, the creative chemistry had shifted.&quot;

&quot;I still like that album&quot;, Iommi reflected in 1997.

==Artwork==
The cover of &quot;Mob Rules&quot; is adapted from a 1974 painting titled “Dream 1: Crucifiers” from a series of paintings by Greg Hildebrandt of the Brothers Hildebrandt partnership. The paintings were created after a projected documentary on world hunger by the brothers under the guidance of the Catholic Church fell through. Greg&#x27;s relationship with the church soured, which resulted in the series of dream paintings. These paintings, including &quot;Dream 1…&quot; were published in 1978 by Ballantine Books in the book &quot;The Art of the Brothers Hildebrandt&quot;.

There were alterations, besides the inclusion of the band&#x27;s name and album title, in the artwork. A hook seen dangling from the left side of the torture implement was changed to a cross. The blood stain in the center of the piece was also altered to more closely resemble a devil&#x27;s head.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Mob Rules&quot; was released on 4 November 1981 to mixed reviews. In the US it went gold and in the UK it reached the Top 20 and spawned two chart singles, the title track and &quot;Turn Up the Night&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato called the album &quot;underrated&quot; and enthused, &quot;&quot;Mob Rules&quot; was given a much punchier in-your-face mix by Birch, who seemed re-energized after his work on new wave of British heavy metal upstarts Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Killers&quot; album. Essentially &quot;Mob Rules&quot; is a magnificent record, with the only serious problem being the sequencing of the material which mirrors &quot;Heaven and Hell&#x27;s&quot; almost to a tee.&quot;

Guitarist Tony Iommi acknowledged this common criticism in his memoir, admitting that he was frustrated at being accused of making &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; part two and speculating that the band would have been criticized regardless of their approach. 

Seven of the album&#x27;s tracks were played live on the Mob Rules Tour. &quot;E5150&quot; was used as an intro tape, and &quot;Over and Over&quot; was the only song not featured on the tour in any way. While the title track was the only song from this album regularly played by Black Sabbath on subsequent tours, &quot;Falling Off the Edge of the World&quot; was performed live by Heaven &amp; Hell (which consisted of the same Black Sabbath lineup that recorded &quot;Mob Rules&quot;), and &quot;Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; occasionally played live by Dio.

J.D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Mob Rules&quot; a negative review in February 1986. Profiling the album in 2008, Bryan Reesman noted: &quot;Even with Dio bringing in more fantasy-based lyrics and moving the group away from seemingly Satanic verses, the title track to &quot;Mob Rules&quot;, not to mention its menacing cover could easily imply a call to anarchy. But beyond the snarling guitars and vocals is actually a cautionary tale against mindless mayhem.&quot;

In modern re-evaluations, the album is generally looked upon very favorably, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarding the album a positive review of 3 stars, and other reviewers such as Allmusic&#x27;s Fred Thomas observing that &quot;Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell work well as each other&#x27;s companion pieces, making the first round of Dio-fronted Sabbath material a bright spot surrounded by relatively grim efforts on either side.&quot; and &quot;Classic Rock&quot; complimenting the lyricism alongside Tony Iommi&#x27;s riffs.

<doc id="656867" wikidata="Q4874096" url="?curid=656867" title="Bay Shore, Michigan">
<text>Bay Shore is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located on the boundary between Charlevoix County and Emmet County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population of the CDP was 657 at the 2020 census.

Bay Shore is located along Little Traverse Bay on Lake Michigan just west of the city of Petoskey. It is mostly within Hayes Township in Charlevoix County with a small portion extending east into Resort Township in Emmet County.

==History==
The land was originally owned by Eugene Sly and Nancy Stauffer. The community was known as both Bay Side to the north and Bay Shore, but the Bay Shore name was adopted when the Chicago and West Michigan Railway built a station there in 1892. The name Bay Shore came from its coastal location on Little Traverse Bay. A post office opened in Bay Shore on July 25, 1892 with Sly serving as the first postmaster. The community was surveyed and platted by John Swift in 1896. The post office operated until September 30, 1965.

While the community no longer has its own post office, it may use the Bay Shore 49711 post office box ZIP Code.

The community of Bay Shore was listed as a newly-organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bay Shore CDP has a total area of , all land.

===Major highways===
* runs through the center of the community near the coast of Lake Michigan.
* is just to the east of the community and runs south to Horton Bay.

==Demographics==

==Education==
Bay Shore is located at the fringes of three separate school districts. The Public Schools of Petoskey to the east in Petoskey serves the eastern portion of the community, including areas in both Charlevoix and Emmet counties. The southernmost portion of the community may be served by Boyne City Public Schools at the northernmost edge of the school district centered far to the south in Boyne City. The western portion of the community may attend Charlevoix Public Schools to the southwest in Charlevoix.

<text>Hubbard Glacier (Lingít: &quot;Sít&#x27; Tlein&quot;) is a glacier located in Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve in eastern Alaska and Kluane National Park and Reserve in Yukon, Canada, and named after Gardiner Hubbard.

== Geography ==
The longest source for Hubbard Glacier originates from its snout and is located at about , approximately west of Mount Walsh with an elevation around . A shorter tributary glacier begins at the easternmost summit on the Mount Logan ridge at about at about .

Before it reaches the sea, Hubbard is joined by the Valerie Glacier to the west, which, through forward surges of its own ice, has contributed to the advance of the ice flow that experts believe will eventually dam the Russell Fjord from Disenchantment Bay waters.

The Hubbard Glacier ice margin has continued to advance for about a century. In May 1986, the Hubbard Glacier surged forward, blocking the outlet of Russell Fjord and creating Russell Lake. All that summer, the new lake filled with runoff; its water level rose , and the decrease in salinity threatened its sea life.

Around midnight on October 8, the dam began to give way. In the next 24 hours, an estimated of water gushed through the gap, and the fjord was reconnected to the ocean at its previous level. This was the largest glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in recorded history.

In spring 2002, the glacier again approached Bert Point. It pushed a terminal moraine ahead of its face and closed the opening again in July. On August 14, the terminal moraine was washed away after rains had raised the water level behind the dam it formed to above sea level. The fjord could become dammed again, and perhaps permanently. If this happens, the fjord could overflow its southern banks and drain through the Situk River instead, threatening trout habitat and a local airport.

It takes about 400 years for ice to traverse the length of the glacier, meaning that the ice at the foot of the glacier is about 400 years old. The glacier routinely calves off icebergs the size of a ten-story building. Where the glacier meets the bay, most of the ice is below the waterline, and newly calved icebergs can shoot up quite dramatically, so that ships must keep their distance from the edge of the glacier in Disenchantment Bay.

==Collision==

On June 25, 2022, the cruise ship Norwegian Sun collided into a growler (a chunk of ice smaller than an iceberg) in foggy conditions as it approached the Hubbard Glacier for sightseeing. The ship was damaged but it was considered safe. It cut its cruise itinerary short and sailed back to Juneau for assessment, and then Seattle for repairs without further incident.

==MV Hubbard==

The Alaska Marine Highway System ferry &quot;MV Hubbard&quot; is named after Hubbard Glacier. This name was chosen by local student Taylor Thompson, whose essay won Alaska&#x27;s name-the-new-ferry contest.

<doc id="656892" wikidata="Q5865607" url="?curid=656892" title="History of the NFL championship">
<text>Throughout its history, the National Football league (NFL) and other rival American football leagues have used several different formats to determine their league champions, including a period of inter-league matchups to determine a true national champion.

Following its founding in Canton, Ohio (1920), the NFL first determined champions through end-of-season standings, switching to a playoff system in 1933 (a one-game playoff was required in 1932).

The rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and American Football League (AFL) have since merged with the NFL (the only two AAFC teams that currently exist, the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers, joined the NFL in ), but AAFC Championship Games and records are not included in the NFL&#x27;s record books. The AFL began play in 1960 and, like its rival league, used a playoff system to determine its champion.

From to , prior to the merger in 1970, the NFL and the AFL agreed to hold an Undisputed Championship Game called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game (renamed the Super Bowl after 1968).

Following the merger in 1970, the Super Bowl name continued as the game to determine the NFL champion. The most important factor of the merger was that all ten AFL teams joined the NFL in , while all AFL Championship Games and records are included in NFL record books. The former NFL Championship Game became the NFC Championship Game, while the former AFL Championship Game became the AFC Championship Game. The NFL lists the old AFL/NFL championship games with &quot;new&quot; AFC/NFC championship games in its record books.

The Green Bay Packers have won the most NFL championship titles with 13 (nine pre-Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls, including the first two AFL-NFL World Championship Games). The Chicago Bears have won the second most overall championships with nine (eight pre-Super Bowl era and one Super Bowl) and the New York Giants have won the third most with eight (four pre-Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls). Although the Cleveland Browns have also won eight overall championships (four AAFC and four pre-Super Bowl era), their four AAFC titles are not recognized by the NFL.

The New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs of the AFL won the last two AFL-NFL World Championship Games, after the name Super Bowl had been officially adopted.

==1920–1932: The early years==
At its inception in , the NFL had no playoff system or championship game: the champion was the team with the best record during the season as determined by winning percentage, with ties excluded. This sometimes led to very unusual results, as teams played anywhere from six to twenty league games in a season, and not all teams played the same number of games or against league talent.

As a result, in the league&#x27;s first six seasons, four league titles were disputed and had to be resolved by the league&#x27;s executive committee. In 1920, the Akron Pros went undefeated, tying three games, but two teams that had won more games (and who had both tied Akron), the Buffalo All-Americans and Decatur Staleys, petitioned the league for a share of the title; both teams&#x27; petitions were denied, and Akron was awarded the first (and only) Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup. According to modern tie-breaking rules, Akron and Buffalo would be co-champions. Akron and Buffalo both awarded their team members with gold medallions.

The next was in the 1921 NFL season, between the same All-Americans and Staleys (with the latter now being based in Chicago). Buffalo had insisted that the last matchup between the two was an exhibition game not to be counted toward the standings, however, Chicago owner George Halas and league management insisted the game be counted in its standings (the league, at the time, did not recognize exhibition matches). The result was that although the two teams were effectively tied in the standings, the disputed game, having been played later, was given more weight and thus ended up being considered a de facto championship game. Chicago also had one fewer tie game.

A nearly identical situation recurred in 1924, when Chicago tried the same tactic of a final game against the Cleveland Bulldogs, but the league ruled the opposite and declared the last game &quot;post-season&quot;, giving the Bulldogs their third consecutive league title.

The fourth and final disputed title was the 1925 NFL Championship controversy between the Pottsville Maroons and the Chicago Cardinals. The Maroons had been controversially suspended by the league at the end of the 1925 NFL season for an unauthorized game against a non-NFL team, allowing the Cardinals to throw together two fairly easy matches (one against a team consisting partly of high school players, also against league rules) to pass Pottsville in the standings. The league awarded the Cardinals the title, one of only two in the team&#x27;s history, but the Cardinals declined the offer and the championship was vacated.

Only in 1933, when the Bidwill family (which still owns the Cardinals) bought the team, did the Cardinals reverse their decision and claim the title as their own, a decision that continues to be disputed, with the Bidwills opposing any change in the record and the two current Pennsylvania teams in favor. The league recognized the Bidwills&#x27; claim to the title and has taken no other action on the issue, although a self-made championship trophy from the Maroons sits in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Ironically, it was Pottsville&#x27;s win in that game against the Notre Dame All-Stars that gave professional football legitimacy over college football.

Part of the controversy over these older championships stems from the criteria the league used to determine its champion. The league used a variation of &quot;win percentage&quot; as its criterion, in which the number of wins is divided by the sum of wins and losses, and ties were excluded. The league began considering ties in its standings in 1972, counting them as half a win and half a loss, but this was not applied retroactively. Had it been, it would have changed the outcome of four 1920-1931 championships: the Buffalo All-Americans would have tied the Akron Pros for the 1920 title, the Duluth Kelleys would have tied the Cleveland Bulldogs for the 1924 title, the Pottsville Maroons would have won in 1925, and the New York Giants would have won in 1930.

Had win–loss differential (the standard method in baseball) been used, the Decatur Staleys would have won the 1920 title by virtue of being one game ahead of Buffalo, and the 1924 title would have been won by the Frankford Yellow Jackets, who were four games ahead of actual champion Cleveland in the standings by that measure.

At the end of the season, the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans were tied with the best winning percentage at .857, with the Spartans record of 6–1–4 and the Bears record of 6–1–6 taken to be six wins, one loss, while the Green Bay Packers finished 10–3–1. 
Had pure win–loss differential or the current (post-1972) system of counting ties as half a win, half a loss been in place in 1932, the Packers&#x27; record of 10–3–1 (.750, +7) would have won them a fourth consecutive championship, ahead of the Spartans&#x27; 6–1–4 (.727, +5) and the Bears&#x27; 6–1–6 (.692, +5).

To determine the champion, the league, reportedly at the behest of George Preston Marshall, voted to hold the first official playoff game in Chicago at Wrigley Field. Because of severe winter conditions before the game, and fear of low turnout, the game was held indoors at Chicago Stadium which forced some temporary rule changes. The game was played on a modified 80-yard dirt field, and Chicago won 9–0, winning the league championship. Since the game counted in the standings, Portsmouth finished third behind Green Bay.

A number of new rule changes were instituted, many inspired by the 1932 indoor championship game: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the hash marks, and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage (instead of five yards behind).

The playoff game proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the season, with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game.

==1933–1965: The advent of the postseason==

===1933–1965: NFL Championship Game===

Starting in , the NFL decided its champion through a single postseason playoff game, called the &quot;NFL Championship Game&quot;. During this period, the league divided its teams into two groups, through as &quot;divisions&quot; and from 1950 onward as &quot;conferences&quot;.
* Divisions (1933–1949): Eastern and Western
* Conferences (1950–1952): American and National
* Conferences (1953–1966): Eastern and Western
* Conferences and Divisions (1967–1969): Eastern (Capitol and Century) and Western (Central and Coastal)

Home field for the 1933 title game was determined by the won-lost percentage in use at the time; the Western Division champion Chicago Bears (10–2–1, ), having a better record than the Eastern Division champion New York Giants (11–3–0, ), won the right to host the first title playoff. Thereafter, from 1934 onward, the divisions alternated the site of the playoff, with the East/American hosting in even years and the West/National in odd years. If there was a tie for first place within the conference, an extra playoff game decided who would go to the NFL Championship Game, with a coin toss deciding where the game would be played. (This occurred nine times in these 34 seasons: 1941, 1943, 1947, 1950 (both conferences), 1952, 1957, 1958, and 1965.)

This last occurred during the 1965 season, when the Green Bay Packers and Baltimore Colts tied for first place in the Western Conference at 10–3–1. Green Bay had won both its games with Baltimore during the regular season, but because no tie-breaker system was in place, a conference playoff game was held on December 26 (what was scheduled to be an off-week between the end of the regular schedule and the NFL Championship Game). The Cleveland Browns, the Eastern champion at 11–3–0, did not play that week. The championship game was then held on its originally scheduled date, January 2, 1966—the first time the NFL champion was crowned in January. Green Bay won both post-season games at home, beating the injury-riddled Colts (with third-string QB Tom Matte) in overtime by a controversial field goal, and taking the title 23–12 on a very muddy field (in what turned out to be Jim Brown&#x27;s final NFL game).

For the 1960 through 1969 seasons, the NFL staged an additional postseason game called the &quot;Playoff Bowl&quot; (aka the &quot;Bert Bell Benefit Bowl&quot; or the &quot;Runner-up Bowl&quot;). These games matched the second-place teams from the two conferences; the CBS television network advertised them as &quot;playoff games for third place in the NFL.&quot; All ten of these consolation games were played in the Orange Bowl in Miami in January, the week &quot;after&quot; the NFL championship game. The NFL now classifies these contests as exhibition games and does not include the records, participants, or results in the official league playoff statistics. The Playoff Bowl was discontinued after the AFL–NFL merger; the final edition was played in January 1970.

Starting with the 1934 game the winning team received the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy. The trophy was named after Ed Thorp, a noted referee, rules expert, and sporting goods dealer. Thorp died in 1934 and a large, traveling trophy was made that year, passed along from champion to champion each season with each championship team&#x27;s name inscribed on it. Teams would also receive a replica trophy. The trophy was last awarded to the Minnesota Vikings in 1969.

Late in the 1940 season, NFL President Carl Storck announced that sudden death periods would be authorized for any playoff game needed to decide either division title. It was emphasized that this did not apply to the final championship game, which would crown co-champions in the event of a tie. While a shared championship was deemed an acceptable solution, it must have become obvious that an elimination game leading to the championship must necessarily produce a winner. Commissioner Elmer Layden approved a similar arrangement for the 1941 season, with the same limitation. A coin toss would decide possession of the Ed Thorp trophy that accompanied the league title should the championship game result in a tie.

Sudden death overtime was finally approved for the NFL championship game in 1946 and has remained in effect ever since. The first playoff game requiring overtime was the 1958 NFL Championship Game.

The 1955 and 1960 NFL championship games were played on Monday afternoons, Christmas having fallen on a Sunday in those years.

===1946–1949: AAFC championship game===

The All-America Football Conference was created in June 1944 to compete against the NFL. Even though the league drew comparable crowds to the NFL in its final three seasons, the continuing dominance of the Cleveland Browns led to the league&#x27;s downfall.
For its first three seasons, the league was divided into two divisions: Eastern and Western (1946–1948). The league had no divisions in 1949. The site of the championship game during the first three was determined just as it was in the NFL—a divisional rotation. In 1949, the league held a four-team playoff, with home field based upon won-lost record.
The Browns, led by Quarterback Otto Graham, won all four of the league championship games.
A tiebreaker playoff game was played in 1948 to break a tie between the Baltimore Colts and Buffalo Bills (AAFC) for the Eastern Division championship. Semifinal playoff games were held in 1949, setting up a championship final between the first-place Browns and the second-place San Francisco 49ers.
In 1948, the Browns became the first professional football team to complete an entire season undefeated and untied — 24 years before the 1972 Miami Dolphins of the NFL would accomplish the task, but this feat is not recognized by NFL record books. Unlike the AFL statistics which are treated as NFL statistics, records of the AAFC and its teams (most of which folded) are not recognized. However, individual AAFC player statistics are included in Pro Football Hall of Fame records, and the defunct conference is memorialized in the Hall.

From 1946 to 1948 the champions of each division met in the AAFC championship game. In 1949, there was only one seven-team division, so the championship game was the final round of a four team tournament.

:1946 December 22 Cleveland Browns 14–9 New York Yankees, Cleveland Municipal Stadium, 41,181
:1947 December 14 Cleveland Browns 14–3 New York Yankees, Yankee Stadium, 60,103
:1948 December 19 Cleveland Browns 49–7 Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Municipal Stadium, 22,981
:1949 December 11 Cleveland Browns 21–7 San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Municipal Stadium, 22,550

===1960–1969: AFL Championship Game===

With its creation in 1960, the AFL determined its champion via a single playoff game between the winners of its two divisions, the Eastern and Western. The AFL Championship games featured classics such as the 1962 double-overtime championship game between the Dallas Texans and the defending champion Houston Oilers. At the time it was the longest professional football championship game ever played. Also in 1963, an Eastern Division playoff was needed to determine the division winner between the Boston Patriots and Buffalo Bills.

==1966–1969: NFL vs. AFL—The beginning of the Super Bowl era==

In 1966, the success of the rival AFL, the spectre of the NFL&#x27;s losing more stars to the AFL, and concern over a costly &quot;bidding war&quot; for players precipitated by the NFL&#x27;s Giants&#x27; signing of Pete Gogolak, who was under contract to the AFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills, led the two leagues to discuss a merger. Pivotal to this was approval by Congress of a law (PL 89-800) that would waive jeopardy to anti-trust statutes for the merged leagues. The major point of the testimony given by the leagues to obtain the law was that if the merger were permitted, &quot;Professional football operations will be preserved in the 23 cities and 25 stadiums where such operations are presently being conducted.&quot; The merger was announced on June 8, 1966, and became fully effective in 1970.
After expanding to enfranchise the New Orleans Saints in , the NFL split its 16 teams into two conferences with two divisions each: the Capitol and Century Divisions in the Eastern Conference, and the Coastal and Central Divisions in the Western Conference. The playoff format was expanded from a single championship game to a four-team tournament, with the four divisional champions participating. The two division winners in each conference met in the &quot;Conference Championships&quot;, with the winners advancing to the NFL Championship Game. Again, the home team for each playoff game was determined by a yearly divisional or conference rotation.

The AFL, on the other hand, raised its total franchise number to ten with the Miami Dolphins joining the Eastern Division in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals joining the Western Division in 1968. The league until 1969 kept using the one-game-playoff format except when division tie-breakers were needed. In its final season, 1969, the AFL adopted a four-team playoff to determine its champion.

Following the NFL and AFL Championship Games for the through seasons, the NFL champion played the AFL champion in Super Bowls I through IV, the only true inter-league championship games in the history of professional football. The first two of these games were known as the &quot;AFL-NFL Championship Game&quot;, as the title &quot;Super Bowl&quot; was not chosen until 1968. Thus the third AFL-NFL matchup was dubbed &quot;Super Bowl III&quot; and the first two matches were retronamed as Super Bowls I and II. The first two games were convincingly won by the NFL&#x27;s Packers, the last two by the AFL&#x27;s New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs, leaving the leagues even at 2–2 in &quot;Championship&quot; competition when they subsequently merged.

All participants in those four AFL-NFL championship games were either AFL champions or NFL champions in the record books, no matter the outcome of the Super Bowl. Three of the four league champions who lost one of the first four Super Bowls would eventually win at least one. The exception is the Minnesota Vikings which went to three others and lost all of them.

==1970–present: The Super Bowl era==
===Post–merger===
After the season and Super Bowl IV, the AFL and NFL fully merged and underwent a re-alignment for the season. Three of the pre-merger NFL teams were transferred to the AFC (Browns, Colts, and Steelers) to level the conferences (AFC and NFC) at 13 teams each; each conference split into three divisions.
With only six division winners in the newly merged league, the NFL designed an eight-team playoff tournament, with four clubs from each conference qualifying. Along with the three division winners in each conference, two &quot;wild card&quot; teams (one from each conference), the second-place finishers with the best records in each conference, were added to the tournament. The first round was named the &quot;Divisional Playoffs&quot;, the winners advancing to the &quot;Conference Championships&quot; (AFC &amp; NFC). Two weeks later, the AFC and NFC champions met in the Super Bowl, now the league&#x27;s championship game. Thus, Super Bowl V in January 1971 was the first Super Bowl played for the NFL title.

With the introduction of the wild card, a rule was instituted to prohibit two teams from the same division (champion and wild card) from meeting in the first-round (Divisional Playoffs). This rule would remain in effect through the season. More significantly, the home teams in the playoffs were still decided by a yearly divisional rotation, not on regular-season records (excluding the wild-card teams, who would always play on the road). This lack of &quot;home-field advantage&quot; was most evident in the 1972 playoffs, when the undefeated Miami Dolphins played the AFC Championship Game at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh against the Steelers, who were undefeated at home during the regular season, but had three losses on the road.

Beginning in , tie games were included in the computing of each team&#x27;s winning percentage. Each tie was then counted as half of a win and half of a loss, rather than being omitted from the computation. Previously, the NFL disregarded any tie games played when they computed the standings, basing it on winning percentage with any ties thrown out and ignored. Overtime games were not played during the regular season until .

===The institution of &quot;home-field advantage&quot;===
In , the league modified its 1970 playoff format by instituting a seeding system. The surviving clubs with the higher seeds were made the home teams for each playoff round. The three division champions in each conference were seeded first through third based on their regular-season records, with the wild-card team in each conference as the fourth seed.

Teams that earned the top seed became known as clinching &quot;home-field advantage&quot; throughout the playoffs, since they played all of their playoff games at their home stadium (except for the Super Bowl, played at a neutral site).

However, the league continued to prohibit meetings between teams from the same division in the Divisional Playoffs. Thus, there would be times when the pairing in that round would pit the first seed versus the third, and the second versus the fourth.

===Further playoff expansion===

The league expanded the playoffs to 10 teams in , adding a second wild-card team (a fifth seed) from each conference. The two wild-card teams from each conference (the fourth and fifth seeds) played each other in the first round, called the &quot;Wild Card Playoffs.&quot; The division winners (the first three seeds) would then receive a &quot;bye&quot; to automatically advance to the Divisional Playoffs, which became the second round of the playoffs. In the divisional round, much like the playoff format, teams from the same division were still prohibited from playing each other, regardless of seeding. Under the format, teams from the same division could meet only in the wild-card round or the conference championship. Thus, as before, a divisional champion could only play a divisional foe in the conference championship game.

A players&#x27; strike shortened the 1982 season to nine games. The league used a special 16-team playoff tournament for that year. The top eight teams from each conference qualified (ignoring the divisional races—there were no division standings, and in some cases, two teams from the same division did not play each other at all that season). The playoffs reverted to the 1978 format in the following year.

In , the NFL expanded the playoffs to twelve teams by adding a third wild-card team (a sixth seed) from each conference. The restrictions on intra-division playoff games during the Divisional Playoffs were removed. However, only the top two division winners in each conference (the 1 and 2 seeds) received byes and automatically advanced to the Divisional Playoffs as host teams. The 3 seed, the division winner with the worst regular-season record in each conference, would then host the 6 seed in the Wild Card Playoffs.

In each conference, the matchup between the 3 and 6 seeds in the wild-card round dictated where the wild-card round winners traveled to for the divisional round:

* If the 3-seeded team won, they traveled to the 2-seeded team while the winner of the 4 vs. 5 matchup traveled to the 1-seeded team.
* If the 6-seeded team won, they traveled to the 1-seeded team while the winner of the 4 vs. 5 matchup traveled to the 2-seeded team.

In , the NFL realigned into eight divisions, four per conference, to accommodate a 32nd team, the Houston Texans. The playoffs remained a 12-team tournament, with four division winners (the 1, 2, 3, and 4 seeds) and two wild cards (the 5 and 6 seeds) from each conference advancing to the playoffs. Again, only the top two division winners in each conference would automatically advance to the Divisional Playoffs, while everybody else had to play in the Wild Card round. Furthermore, the league still maintains the names &quot;Wild Card Playoffs&quot;, &quot;Divisional Playoffs&quot;, and &quot;Conference Championships&quot; for the first, second, and third rounds of the playoffs, respectively.

Playoff expansion was initially tabled by the league owners in 2013. However, beginning with the season, the NFL did expand the playoffs to 14 teams. With the new format, seven teams per conference made the playoffs, with only the top seed in each conference receiving a bye.

==Championship games per season==
Below is a list of professional football champions per season as recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===APFA/NFL standings champions (1920–1932)===

For the first thirteen seasons, the APFA/NFL did not hold a championship game, except in , when a playoff game was held. Played indoors on a reduced-size field in order to break a tie in the standings, it was the precursor to the championship game (though the losing team finished in third place in the final standings). For the seasons from –, the NFL did not include tie games in the winning percentage; they were omitted from the calculation.

===NFL Championship Game (1933–1965)===
===Super Bowl championship (1966–present)===

==NFL championships by franchise==
In the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of wins, then by number of appearances, then by year of first championship won, and finally by year of first appearance. Does not include folded NFL teams with zero &quot;Appearances/Top 2 Finishes.&quot; In the &quot;Seasons&quot; column, bold years indicate NFL championships won.


==List of various league/world championship game systems==


==Undefeated regular seasons and &quot;perfect seasons&quot; in professional football==

(*) Since the NFL did not count tied games in league standings until 1972, these seasons were considered to be &quot;perfect&quot; at the time they finished; further, these teams had no incentive to avoid tied games in order to maintain a &quot;perfect&quot; season. Thus, the accuracy of calling these seasons &quot;imperfect&quot; is still disputed.

<text>The Bay View Association of the United Methodist Church, known as Bay View, is an example of two uniquely American community forms: the Methodist camp meeting and the independent Chautauqua. Designed for the first purpose in 1876 as the county&#x27;s only romantically-planned campground, and adapted for the second from 1885 to 1915, Bay View has remained in continuous operation since its foundation.

==Description==

Bay View is incorporated as a domestic nonprofit organization under Act 39 of the Public Acts of 1899, being MCL 455.51. Act 39 of the Public Acts of 1899 establishes Bay View as a body politic and corporate. The association was originally formed as part of the Methodist Camp Meeting movement and adopted a Chautauqua program in 1886.

The association&#x27;s grounds contain approximately 440 cottages and 30 community-owned buildings. There are two hotels on premises: Stafford&#x27;s Bay View Inn (1886), and The Terrace Inn and 1911 Restaurant. Other facilities include a post office, beach with a swim area, children&#x27;s pool and a sail house. The community is located on about , dropping in a series of terraces from a to the shore of Little Traverse Bay. Residents lease the land under the cottages from the Association, which charges annual Chautauqua fees and taxes.

Bay View is located in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located in Bear Creek Township, Emmet County on Little Traverse Bay and abuts the east side of the city of Petoskey along U.S. Highway 31. The ZIP code is 49770 and the FIPS place code is 06260. The association is bounded by Little Traverse Bay on the north, Division Road on the east, Petoskey city limits on the west, and on the south by the south line of Township 35 North. The Bay View census-designated place (CDP) includes the association grounds and additional areas east of Division Road. As of the 2010 census the population of the CDP was 133, due to the inclusion of an area outside of the association grounds in the CDP.

===Architecture===
Nearly all the structures in the community were built in the 1875–1900 time period. Most buildings are Eastlake and Stick style, with some Queen Anne and Shingle style architecture. Cottages are set on along gently curving streets running along the natural terraces. In the center of the community is The Campus (originally Tabernacle Park). Many of the larger communal structures are located here, including the original 1877 preaching stand, as well an 1880 book store and multiple educational buildings constructed around 1890. In 1879, an artesian well water system was installed, providing spring water. However, the pipes were laid very shallowly, and had to be drained in the winter months to prevent freezing. Now, the community is closed from November through April, during which time the residences on the association grounds must be vacated. John M. Hall Auditorium, replaced the 1881 Chapel and the 1887 New Tabernacle/Old Auditorium.

== History ==
Bay View was founded in 1875 by Michigan Methodists as a camp meeting &quot;for scientific and intellectual culture, and for the promotion of religion and morality.&quot; Bay View&#x27;s origins can be traced to the camp meeting movement which saw the development of similar resorts such as Wesleyan Grove on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, or Lakeside, Ohio.

The group considered multiple locations, and eventually struck a deal with the citizens of Petoskey and the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, where the Petoskey citizenry would pay to extend the railroad line from their town to Bay View, the railroad would purchase the site, and the Methodists would agree to improve the location and hold camp meetings there for fifteen years. In 1876, the first group of Methodists travelled to the site, cleared an area of underbrush, and built a preaching stand and an audience area under the trees. Dr. Seth Reed chose the name of Bay View. He was secretary of the Bay View Association for 14 years. Dr. Reed platted the grounds and named the streets, some of which were named after early settlers. On August 2, 1876, the first meeting was held at the site. Dr. Pilcher suggested the name Bay View, and selected the site of the Speaker&#x27;s Stand. He wrote articles of incorporation, stating the assembly was &quot;organized for intellectual and scientific culture, and for the promotion of the cause of religion and morality.&quot; Shelter at the time was only in tents. Construction of cottages began almost immediately, and by 1881 there were about 150 at the site. By this time, the original religious-oriented camp meeting program had languished and the association hired John M. Hall to organize Bay View&#x27;s interdenominational Assembly program: a &quot;Christian Institution of the broadest catholicity.&quot; Departments included Bible, Missionary, Social, Health, Industrial, Country Life: American and International.

Under the leadership of John M. Hall, Bay View adopted a Chautauqua program which included a series of educational lectures, classes, entertainment, political speeches, and music, began in 1886, and the community developed around these activities. These programs, along with programs for children and a variety of classes, took place in July and August of each year. The program was immensely successful, as a result, number of cottages in the community soared, with 200 in 1887, 400 in 1895, and 500 in 1901. Many of these newcomers were from other, non-Methodist denominations, and many stayed all summer rather than for only a few weeks of the year. Hall writes of the transformation of Bay View from its camp meeting roots to a Chautauqua: &quot;founded by Methodists, it is now by its organic law interdenominational in management and life. People of every denomination are there in large numbers and so beautiful is the hospitality of ideas that another&#x27;s specific church affiliations never occurs to one.&quot; In 1887, the Bay View Summer University opened. The University was associated with Albion College in 1919 until 1969.

The Bay View Association was listed as a National Historic Landmark district in 1987 as &quot;one of the finest remaining examples of two uniquely American community forms, the Methodist Camp Meeting and the independent Chautauqua.&quot;

==The Four Pillars of Chautauqua==
Bay View&#x27;s continues to the Chautauqua program established by John M. Hall to this day. The four pillars are arts, education, recreation, and religion.

===Religion===

Sundays find members and visitors participating in Communion, Sunday School and Assembly Worship. Vespers are now concerts beginning and ending with a hymn and closing benediction. Carillon bells call us to Worship and eventide. Youth groups, Bible studies and prayer meetings are offered throughout the summer. Daily Religion and Life lectures offer further study from Sunday&#x27;s preacher.

History - Founders desired a setting for spiritual refreshment and renewal of soul, mind and body. &quot;We came to worship God, to establish a center of Christian influence...a place where Christian people could meet, enjoy fellowship...where God shall be honored...&quot; &quot;Tabernacle Park&quot;, in the center of the grounds was &quot;God&#x27;s first temple&quot;, the camp meeting place. &quot;Rev. Dr. E.H. Pilcher, president, preached the opening sermon in 1876..., dedicating the grounds to the worship of Almighty God.&quot; Soon thousands came by rail and boat for all-day Big Sundays filled with worship, singing, and learning. Local Odawa and Ojibwa attended camp meeting services, where &quot;Chief Petoskey&#x27;s granddaughter accompanied the singing on the pump organ.&quot; By 1885 Ministerial Unions, Preacher&#x27;s Conferences for lay preachers and teachers were added. Bay View&#x27;s 25th anniversary pamphlet highlights that &quot;Though a Methodist Institution, Bay View is not a church or denominational establishment, but a Christian Institution of the broadest catholicity, welcoming to full membership all men and women of any or no denomination who have a desire to be part of such a community as this.&quot; 

The first Sunday School Congress, 1877, featured famous preachers and teachers including Rev. Jesse Lyman Hurlbut and Frank Beard, initiator of Chalk Talks. Inspirational lessons were taken from the &quot;Course of Sabbath School Normal Lessons,&quot; developed at the Chautauqua Sunday School Conference. Horace Hitchcock took over the popular Bay View Sunday school in 1886. Donations from state Sunday Schools provided funds for building of Hitchcock Hall, dedicated in 1889. John H. Vincent sent Chautauqua congratulations.

===Music Festival===
The Bay View Music Festival is one of the longest running collegiate chamber music festivals in North America. It was begun in 1886 with the choir from Court Street Methodist Church from Flint, Michigan. The program grew rapidly led by respected musicians from conservatories in Detroit, Ann Arbor, and Chicago. The music program has been associated and accredited through Oberlin College, Cornell College, DePaul University, Albion College Alma College, and the University of Michigan. Most noted among the directors in the festival&#x27;s 132-year history is William Reddick and Howard Barlow. Concertmaster Max Bendix of the Theodore Thomas Orchestra in Chicago was the first of many violinists including Robert Mann, Mikhail Press, Leon Marx, concertmaster of the Chicago Opera Orchestra and Austrian violinist Hugo Gottesmann.

Madame Schumann Heink, Gladys Swarthout, John Charles Thomas, Richard Crooks, James Melton, Jennie Tourel, Martha Lipton, Thomas L. Thomas, Walter Taussig, Etta Moten, Mildred Dilling, Ossip and Clara Gabrilovisch, Jerome Hines, Sherrill Milnes, Diane Bish, George Shirley, Boston Brass, Ara Berberian, Martina Arroyo, and Virginia Zeani, are a few of the musicians to teach and perform at Bay View. The Fisk Jubilee Singers made four appearances as did other jubilee groups. The Williams&#x27; Jubilee Singers were the featured group to open the John M. Hall Auditorium in 1914.

The festival has followed the national trends over the decades in featuring large choral works, classical music, devotional repertoire, chamber music, and recently has included a wide variety of popular groups to appeal the variety of musical tastes.
Theatrical production date back to the 1890s with road shows such as the Ben Greet Players and sporadic local productions. It became a regular feature of the Performing Arts Department when New York tenor Director Willard Pierce joined the music staff. Plays, musicals, children&#x27;s productions, and opera productions are all featured on the annual schedule.

Today, the Bay View Music Festival offers approximately 180 students scholarships for coaching and teaching chamber music, vocal performance, collaborative piano, opera, musical theater taught by over 40 faculty members. An annual hand bell concert features directors and professionals from all over the US. A special opera seminar is offered in June. The 10-week program includes a mix of nearly 80 theatrical productions, recitals, chamber music concerts, choral performances, brass, woodwind and string instrument concerts and appearances by classical artists and famous jazz and popular individuals and groups.

===Recreation===
The Bay View Recreation program offers recreational activities for people of all ages and has always been a primary element of the Bay View Association. It is one of the pillars of its Chautauqua foundation. The program revolves around the Day Camp (Boys &amp; Girls Club) that offers a safe, stimulating environment in which children participate in healthy and creative activities. From mid-June to August, children participate in age-appropriate morning activities at Tot Lot (ages 3–4), Fawns (5-6), and Boys&#x27; And Girls&#x27; Club (7-14). These activities include games, athletics, arts &amp; crafts, songs, scavenger hunts, and educational programming. The camp is located at Swift Field, centrally located in the community. Every Friday, an all-camp event is held for a large group activity such as the carnival, capture the flag, and the Ernie Gray Olympics. In the afternoon, activities move to the waterfront where children can participate in swimming, tennis, and sailing, including lessons in each activity. Weekend activities include tennis tournaments and sailing races. On Monday nights, the recreation program hosts a community hotdog roast. The motto of the Boys and Girls Club is &quot;Fun and recreation for all.&quot;

The recreational facilities include Swift Field, the Tot Lot building, the Fawn House, the Boys &amp; Girls Club clubhouse, the craft house, 3 playgrounds, 9 tennis courts, 4 pickleball courts, the boathouse (with sunfish, lasers, kayaks, paddle boards, and other boats available for use by the community), a beach, a children&#x27;s pool, a teen center, a fitness trail, lawn bowling, shuffleboard, and croquet courts. There are also 167 acres of pristine woods with trails along with multiple parks and open spaces around the community grounds.

In 2020, Bay View enhanced its waterfront with a 125-foot extension to its pier. This was a multimillion dollar project aimed at increasing safety for the swimming and boating areas and to protect against erosion.

History - 
The site of Bay View was chosen in part for its recreational opportunities. In 1875, the Conference Committee tasked with locating a proposed site for what would become Bay View foresaw &quot;the great summer resort of the northwest…for scores of miles in almost every direction offers facilities for recreation which are simply endless.&quot; At the 2nd Annual Meeting, the trustees were asked to amend the By Laws to add the Committee on Recreations to its list of standing Committees. By 1901, the Boys and Girls Club was established.

In 1910, additional development expanded the waterfront program with the construction of Recreation Hall on the shoreline. The building contained a swimming pool and a 4-lane bowling alley. Long since removed, the building now houses the &quot;Rec Club&quot; teen center and the boathouse. In the early 1920s, what would become Swift Field was developed. Since its dedication in 1924, it has been the central location for land-based recreational activities for youth, including baseball, archery, tetherball, badminton, and ping-pong. In 1955, the Boys and Girls Clubhouse was erected at Swift Field. The Boys &amp; Girls Club evolved during this time and came to its modern form under the direction of Ernie Gray. Activities were organized for children, ages 3–14. Swimming lessons, sailing, and tennis were also incorporated into the afternoon programming.

===Education===
Education has been an important part of the Chautauqua movement, beginning with the New York Chautauqua Institution then spreading to Bay View Association and other Midwest Chautauquas.

Bay View offered more than sixty classes in 2017 including art, literature, history, reading circles, and culinary classes. Education classes have been offered in Bay View for over a century. In 1888, a comprehensive set of Education courses was offered. This School of Liberal Arts attracted college professors to teach the courses. A School of Elocution was part of the curriculum in that year.

Guest Lecturers have been enhancing the summer experience for over one hundred years. In 1895, Jane Addams, leader of the settlement house movement, spoke on &#x27;The Inception, Establishment, &amp; Accomplishments of Chicago&#x27;s Hull House&#x27;. She returned in 1903 to speak on her controversial stand on saloons and dancing. Helen Keller came to speak in 1913 on &#x27;The Heart &amp; the Hand; or the Right use of our senses&#x27;. Each year American Experience lecturers visit and speak on campus, as well as Faith lecturers as part of the Religion Program. Recent Lecturers include David Kennedy in 2016. Professor Kennedy, a Pulitzer Prize winner, presented a series of lectures on &#x27;WWII and the World It Made&#x27;. Reverend Dr. Barbara Essex gave a series of 5 lectures in 2012. Dr. Akhil Reed Amar, Professor of Constitutional Law at Yale University lectured in 2012 and will be the 2018 American Experience speaker.

Each year, Bay View initiates a &#x27;Big Read&#x27; where a book is selected for all the surrounding communities to read. The author visits in July and holds a discussion on Bay View&#x27;s campus. In 2017 the &#x27;Big Read&#x27; was &quot;Terror in the City of Champions – Murder, Baseball, and the Secret Society that Shocked Depression-era Detroit&quot; by Tom Stanton.

==Controversies==
On August 7, 2018 the Bay View Association removed the requirement that members be of &quot;Christian persuasion.&quot; Nearly 70 percent of Bay View members voted in favor of the amendment, which immediately went into effect. Membership in the Bay View Association is required to own a cottage in the community. That vote left in place a bylaw which required that five of the nine members of the resort&#x27;s ruling board must be Methodist. A subsequent lawsuit resulted in a consent decree, approved by the board on July 9, 2019, which removed that requirement.

The Bay View Association has had other membership requirements. When the association was founded in 1875 there were no explicit requirements, but in 1942 the Bay View Board adopted the following resolution: &quot;No person shall be accepted as a member of this association or be allowed to rent or lease property or a room, for longer than a period of one day, unless such person is of the white race and a Christian who must provide acceptable and good recommendations. This resolution does not apply to servants within a household or to employes[sic]&quot;.

In 1947 the by-laws were revised to add &quot;Any person twenty-one years of age and good moral character, by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Trustees, may be accepted as a member of this Association provided that he or she is of the Caucasian race and of Christian persuasion.&quot; The two provisions Caucasian requirements were removed in 1959.

From the 1960s through to the 1980s there was a quota on how many Catholics were allowed to be members. Membership of Catholics was not to exceed 10% of the total membership. Once the quota was met additional Catholics applicants were rejected. This quota requirement was abandoned in the 1980s.

On August 6, 2011, the Bay View Association members voted on a proposal that would remove the Christian affiliation requirement. The proposal was defeated by a vote of 52% (381 members) opposed to 48% (346 members) in favor of the proposal. The proposal needed a two thirds majority to pass.

On August 3, 2013, another vote was taken to change the membership qualification requirements to include non-Christians. The proposal was again defeated by a vote of 51.85% (364 members) for the change to 48.14% (338 members) opposed to the change. A two-thirds majority is required to pass the amendment.

The Board, led by President Jon Chism, held the belief that Bay View should defend the membership requirements, resulting in a increase in the Association&#x27;s directors and officers insurance.

In July 2017, The Bay View Chautauqua Inclusiveness Group filed a civil rights and religious discrimination lawsuit against the Bay View Association in the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan.
In May 2019, mediation resulted in an agreement to resolve the controversy. The agreement was implemented on July 18, 2019 by a Consent Order from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. There is no longer any religious requirement for membership in the Association or to buy a cottage.

The Consent Order which ended the membership controversy did not restrict the religious program of the Association. As a Chautauqua, the Bay View Association conducts programming in the areas of religion, education, recreation, and the performing arts. The Association employs a Director of Worship and Religious Activities, conducts Sunday worship services, and presents lectures on religious subjects daily during the summer Assembly Season. All elements of all the programs are open to the general public.

The Association&#x27;s Mission Statement is also not affected by the Court&#x27;s Order. The mission of the Bay View Association is to be an institution in which Christian values and traditions are central; To enrich the human experience for individuals and families within Bay View and the surrounding community through a seasonal program of religious, educational, cultural and recreational opportunities; And to provide a Christian perspective in a changing world.

In July 2020, Bay View faced backlash from their community for perceived racist activity. Members in support of the Black Lives Matter movement wrote the names of Black victims of police brutality on sidewalks in Bay View as part of the &quot;say their names&quot; campaign. The President of the Board of Trustees ordered the grounds crew to wash away the chalk, and sent an email to members threatening to fine those who chalked the sidewalk. This sparked divisive discourse within the association. Members asked the Board of Trustees to release a statement condemning racism, which the Board ultimately voted against in a 7 - 2 vote.

<text>Fundy Royal (formerly known as Royal from 1914 to 1966, Fundy—Royal from 1966 to 2003, and Fundy in 2003–2004) is a federal electoral district in southern New Brunswick, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1917.

The riding roughly covers the area in between the three largest cities in the province; Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton. Included in the riding are the towns of Quispamsis, Hampton, Sussex, Fundy-St. Martins, Three Rivers, Salisbury and part of Riverview. Also included are the area around Loch Lomond east of Saint John, and the Kingston Peninsula.

The neighbouring ridings are Saint John—Rothesay, New Brunswick Southwest, Fredericton, Miramichi—Grand Lake, Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, and Beauséjour.

==History==
The riding of &quot;Royal&quot; was created in 1914. The name came from the counties of Queens and Kings, of which it was composed.

In 1966, Royal riding was amalgamated with most of Albert County and a rural portion of Saint John County into a new riding, &quot;Fundy—Royal&quot;. One parish in Queens county was reapportioned into York—Sunbury at this time. In the 2003 redistribution, it lost almost all of Queens County and a large part of Kings County to other ridings; while gaining western Westmorland County. The riding was renamed &quot;Fundy&quot;. This name was changed to &quot;Fundy Royal&quot; in 2004. As per the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, this riding will gain territories from Beauséjour, Saint John and New Brunswick Southwest, and lose a small territory to the new riding of Saint John—Rothesay.

The riding has been one of the most supportive of the Conservatives in the country, returning a member of that party or its predecessors in every election, except for the 1993 election when Liberal Paul Zed won and the 2015 election when Liberal Alaina Lockhart won.

<text>An essential patent or standard-essential patent (SEP) is a patent that claims an invention that must be used to comply with a technical standard. Standard-setting organizations (SSOs) normally require their members to agree to license their essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Determining which patents are essential to a particular standard can be complex.

<doc id="656932" wikidata="Q131215" url="?curid=656932" title="SK Rapid Wien">
<text>Sportklub Rapid (), commonly known as Rapid Wien or Rapid Vienna in English, is an Austrian professional football club playing in the country&#x27;s capital city of Vienna. Rapid has won the most Austrian championship titles (32), including the first title in the season 1911–12, as well as a German championship in 1941 during Nazi rule, although its cross-city arch rival FK Austria Vienna has won more combined league and cup titles. Rapid twice reached the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1985 and 1996, losing on both occasions.

The club is often known as &quot;Die Grün-Weißen&quot; (The Green-Whites) for its team colours or as &quot;Hütteldorfer&quot;, in reference to the location of the Gerhard Hanappi Stadium, which is in Hütteldorf, part of the city&#x27;s 14th district in Penzing.

==History==

The club was founded in 1897 as Erster Wiener Arbeiter-Fußball-Club (First Viennese Workers&#x27; Football Club). The team&#x27;s original colours were red and blue, which are still often used in away matches. On 8 January 1899, the club was (thanks to Wilhelm Goldschmidt), taking on its present name of Sportklub Rapid, following the example of Rapide Berlin. &quot;Wien&quot; or &quot;Vienna&quot; are commonly added when referring to the club but are not part of the official name. In 1904, the team colours were changed to green and white. The club won Austria&#x27;s first ever national championship in 1911–12 by a single point, and retained the title the following season.
===Between World Wars===
Rapid became a dominant force during the years between the world wars, an era in which Austria was one of the leading football nations on the continent. It won its first hat-trick of titles from 1919 to 1921. After the annexation of Austria to Germany in 1938, Rapid joined the German football system, playing in the regional first division Gauliga Ostmark along with clubs such as Wacker Wien and Admira Vienna. Rapid would be the most successful of these clubs. They won the Tschammerpokal, predecessor of today&#x27;s DFB-Pokal, in 1938 with a 3–1 victory over FSV Frankfurt, and followed that with a German Championship in 1941 by defeating Schalke 04, the most dominant German club of the era. The team was able to overcome a 3–0 Schalke lead to win the match 4–3.

===Post-World War II===
As the winners of the 1954–55 season, Rapid were Austria&#x27;s entrant for the inaugural European Cup in the following season. They were drawn in the first round against PSV and opened with a 6–1 home victory, with Alfred Körner scoring a hat-trick. Despite losing the away leg 1–0, the club still advanced to a quarter-final, where they started with a 1–1 home draw against Milan before being defeated 7–2 in the away match at the San Siro to lose 8–3 on aggregate.

Rapid&#x27;s best performance in the European Cup came in the 1960–61 season when they reached the semi-final before being eliminated by eventual winners Benfica, 4–1 on aggregate. Previously, in the quarter-final the club required a replay to eliminate East German club Aue from the tournament after a 3–3 aggregate draw. The away goals rule would have seen Aue advance without needing the replay, held at the St Jakob Park in neutral Basel.

The club was involved in a controversial episode in 1984 when they eliminated Celtic from the last 16 of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Celtic were leading 4–3 on aggregate with 14 minutes left in the match when Rapid conceded a penalty. As the Rapid players protested to the match officials, their defender Rudolf Weinhofer then fell to the ground and claimed to have been hit by a bottle thrown from the stands. However, television images clearly showed that a bottle was thrown onto the pitch and did not hit Weinhofer. The match finished 4–3, but Rapid appealed to UEFA for a replay, and both teams were fined. The replay appeal was turned down initially, but Rapid appealed for a second time. On this occasion, Rapid&#x27;s fine was doubled but UEFA also stipulated the match be replayed from Celtic&#x27;s ground. The game was held on 12 December 1984 at Old Trafford, Manchester, and Rapid won 1–0 through a Peter Pacult strike.

Rapid reached its first European final in 1985, losing 3–1 in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final to Everton in Rotterdam. Eleven years later, in the same tournament&#x27;s final in Brussels, Rapid lost 1–0 to Paris Saint-Germain.

Rapid last reached the group stage of the UEFA Champions League in 2005–06 after beating F91 Dudelange of Luxembourg 9–3 on aggregate and then defeating Lokomotiv Moscow 2–1 on aggregate in a play-off after a 1–0 victory in Russia. They eventually finished last in their group after losing all of their matches against Bayern Munich, Juventus and Club Brugge.

In 2015, the Rapid youth team took part in the third season of the Football for Friendship international children&#x27;s social program, the final events of which were held in Berlin.

==Club culture==

===Rapid Viertelstunde===
Almost since the club&#x27;s beginnings, Rapid fans have announced the last 15 minutes of the match by way of the traditional &quot;Rapid-Viertelstunde&quot; – rhythmic clapping at home or away regardless of the score. The first mention of the practice goes back to 1913, and on 21 April 1918 a newspaper wrote about the fans clapping at the beginning of the &quot;Rapid-Viertelstunde&quot;. Over the decades, there have been many instances where the team managed to turn around a losing position by not giving up and, with their fans&#x27; support, fighting their way to a win just before the final whistle.

===Fans===

The biggest fan club is Ultras Rapid, which was founded in 1988. Other important fan clubs are the ultras group Tornados Rapid and Spirits Rapid and the hooligan firm Alte Garde Dritte Halbzeit.

The active supporters are situated in the Block West stand, which has a capacity of 8,500 spectators. The old Block West in the now demolished Gerhard-Hanappi-Stadion had about 2,700 seats.

The fan-base of Rapid is connected, in a friendly way, with the supporters of the German club Nürnberg, the Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb, the Italian club Venezia, the Hungarian club Ferencváros and the Greek club Panathinaikos. As Rapid, Ferencváros and Panathinaikos also play in green the alliance is nicknamed the &quot;Green Brothers&quot;

==Stadium==
Rapid played at the Gerhard Hanappi Stadium - which was opened on 10 May 1977 with a Vienna derby match against Austria Wien - until the 2013–14 season. The stadium bore the name of its architect Gerhard Hanappi, who also played for Rapid from 1950 to 1965. Prior to 1980, when it was renamed in his honour, it was known as the &quot;Weststadion&quot; (Western Stadium), due to its geographical location in the city.

In June 2014, it was announced that a new stadium, the Allianz Stadion, will be built in place of the old Gerhard Hanappi Stadium. During its construction, Rapid played its home games in the Ernst Happel Stadion.

The stadium was officially unveiled when Rapid Wien hosted Chelsea in a pre-season friendly on 16 July 2016 and won 2–0.

==Rivalries==

Rapid Wien contest the Vienna derby with their local Vienna rival FK Austria Wien. The two clubs are amongst the most supported and successful football teams in the entire country, and are the only Austrian clubs to have never been relegated. Both teams originate from Hietzing, the 13th district in the west of the city, but have since moved into different districts. While Austria Wien is seen as a middle-class club, Rapid traditionally hold the support of the capital&#x27;s working class. The two clubs first met in a league championship match on 8 September 1911, a 4–1 victory for Rapid. The fixture is the most-played derby in European football after the Old Firm in Glasgow between Rangers and Celtic.

==Honours==

===Domestic===
Rapid Wien is Austria&#x27;s record titleholder, lifting the trophy a total of 32 times, and the club also won a German Championship and German Cup while part of that country&#x27;s football competition from 1938 to 1945 following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany on 12 March 1938.

<text>The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men&#x27;s national football teams organised by FIFA. It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America.

31 national teams advanced through qualification competitions to join the host nation in the final tournament (with Bosnia and Herzegovina as the only debutant). A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues located in as many host cities across Brazil. For the first time at a World Cup finals, match officials used goal-line technology, as well as vanishing spray for free kicks. FIFA Fan Fests in each host city gathered a total of 5 million people, and the country received 1 million visitors from 202 countries. Spain, the defending champions, were eliminated at the group stage. Host nation Brazil, who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, lost to Germany 7–1 in the semi-finals and eventually finished in fourth place.

In the final, Germany defeated Argentina 1–0 after extra time thanks to a Mario Götze half-volley in the 113th minute of the final to win the tournament and secure the country&#x27;s fourth world title, their first major tournament win since UEFA Euro 1996, the first after German reunification in 1990, when as West Germany they also beat Argentina by the same score in 90 minutes in the World Cup final. Germany became the first European team to win a World Cup staged in the Americas, and this result marked the third consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010.
==Host selection==
In March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978, in line with its policy at the time of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations. With the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted in South Africa, it would be the second consecutive World Cup outside Europe, which was a first for the tournament. It was also sixth time (second consecutive) in the Southern Hemisphere. Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but, after the withdrawal of the latter from the process, Brazil was officially elected as host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007.

==Participating teams and officials==

===Qualification===
Following qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with their last pre-tournament FIFA world ranking – qualified for the final tournament. Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup. Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals. Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence, while Belgium and Russia both returned after 12 years. Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994. This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries. Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd).

As of 2022, this was the last time Chile, Ivory Coast, Greece, Italy, Honduras, and Algeria qualified for the World Cup finals, the only time Bosnia and Herzegovina have qualified, and the last time Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Denmark, Poland, and Serbia failed to qualify. This was also the most recent World Cup finals to feature every prior winning team.

===Final draw===
The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players. Hosted by TV presentators Fernanda Lima and Tadeu Schmidt and conducted by the FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke, the draw featured football celebrities from all FIFA World Cup champion countries such as Cafu (Brazil), Fabio Cannavaro (Italy), Lothar Matthäus (Germany), Zinédine Zidane (France), Mario Alberto Kempes (Argentina), Fernando Hierro (Spain), Geoff Hurst (England) and Alcides Ghiggia (Uruguay).

The 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups. In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot. As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations. Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.

===Officials===

In March 2013, FIFA published a list of 52 prospective referees, each paired, on the basis of nationality, with two assistant referees, from all six football confederations for the tournament. On 14 January 2014, the FIFA Referees Committee appointed 25 referee trios and eight support duos representing 43 countries for the tournament.
Yuichi Nishimura from Japan acted as referee in the opening match whereas Nicola Rizzoli from Italy acted as referee in the final.

===Squads===
As with the 2010 tournament, each team&#x27;s squad consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers). Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than 10 days before the start of the tournament. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game. During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team were available to be one of the three permitted substitutions (provided the player was not serving a suspension).

==Venues==
12 venues (seven new and five renovated) in twelve cities were selected for the tournament. The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil. Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams. During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base camps, as well as staging official fan fests where supporters could view the games.

The most used stadiums were the Maracanã and Brasília, which hosted seven matches each. The least-used venues were in Cuiabá, Manaus, Natal, and Curitiba, which hosted four matches each; as the four smallest stadiums in use at the tournament, they did not host any knockout round matches.

===Team base camps===
Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team, having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations. Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region. Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest.

===FIFA Fan Fests===

For a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA staged FIFA Fan Fests in each of the 12 host cities throughout the competition. Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo&#x27;s Vale do Anhangabaú. The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.

==Innovations==

===Technologies===

In order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at, among other competitions, the 2013 Confederations Cup. The chosen Goal Control system featured 14 high speed cameras, 7 directed to each of the goals. Data were sent to the central image-processing centre, where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal. The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal. France&#x27;s second goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given.

Following successful trials, FIFA approved the use of vanishing spray by the referees for the first time at a World Cup Finals. The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.

The Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan. Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.

===Cooling breaks===
Due to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced. Breaks could take place at the referee&#x27;s discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded ; the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.

The first cooling break in a World Cup play took place during the 32nd minute of the match between the Netherlands and Mexico in the round of 16. At the start of the match, FIFA listed the temperature at with 68% humidity.

===Anti-doping===
The biological passport was introduced in the FIFA World Cup starting in 2014. Blood and urine samples collected from all players before the competition, and from two players per team per match, were analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses. FIFA reported that 91.5% of the players taking part in the tournament were tested before the start of the competition and none tested positive. However, FIFA was criticised for how it conducted doping tests.

==Format==

The first round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four, where each group engaged in a round-robin tournament within itself. The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage. Teams were awarded three points for a win and one for a draw. When comparing teams in a group over-all result came before head-to-head.
In the knockout stage there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. The two semi-final losers competed in a third place play-off. For any match in the knockout stage, a draw after 90 minutes of regulation time was followed by two 15 minute periods of extra time to determine a winner. If the teams were still tied, a penalty shoot-out was held to determine a winner.

The match schedule was announced on 20 October 2011 with the kick-off times being confirmed on 27 September 2012; after the final draw, the kick-off times of seven matches were adjusted by FIFA. The competition was organised so that teams that played each other in the group stage could not meet again during the knockout phase until the final (or the 3rd place match).
The group stage began on 12 June, with the host nation competing in the opening game as has been the format since the 2006 tournament. The opening game was preceded by an opening ceremony that began at 15:15 local time.

==Opening ceremony==
On 12 June 2014, the 20th edition of the FIFA World Cup began with the opening ceremony at Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. The event saw 660 dancers take to the stadium and perform in a ceremony which celebrated the nature of the country and its love of football. Following the dancers native singer Claudia Leitte emerged on centre stage to perform for the crowd. She was later joined by Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, and American singer Jennifer Lopez to perform the tournament&#x27;s official song &quot;We Are One (Ole Ola)&quot; which had been released as an official single on 8 April 2014. Following the ceremony, the opening match was played, which saw the hosts come from behind to beat Croatia 3–1.

==Group stage==
The group stage of the cup took place in Brazil from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each team played three games. The group stage was notable for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals. The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930. The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament. This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998 and the largest average in a group stage since 1958. World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy&#x27;s from the 1950 tournament. Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002. For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.

===Bracket===
Results decided after extra time are indicated by (a.e.t.), and results decided via a penalty shoot-out are indicated by (p).

===Round of 16===
All the group winners advanced into the quarter-finals. They included four teams from UEFA, three from CONMEBOL, and one from CONCACAF. Of the eight matches, five required extra-time, and two of these required penalty shoot-outs; this was the first time penalty shoot-outs occurred in more than one game in a round of 16. The goal average per game in the round of 16 was 2.25, a drop of 0.58 goals per game from the group stage. The eight teams to win in the round of 16 included four former champions (Brazil, Germany, Argentina and France), a three-time runner-up (Netherlands), and two first-time quarter-finalists (Colombia and Costa Rica). Belgium reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 1986.

&quot;All times listed below are at local time (UTC−3)&quot;
----







===Quarter-finals===
With a 1–0 victory over France, Germany set a World Cup record with four consecutive semi-final appearances. Brazil beat Colombia 2–1, but Brazil&#x27;s Neymar was injured and missed the rest of the competition. Argentina reached the final four for the first time since 1990 after a 1–0 win over Belgium. The Netherlands reached the semi-finals for the second consecutive tournament, after overcoming Costa Rica in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw at the end of extra time, with goalkeeper Tim Krul having been substituted on for the shoot-out and saving two penalties.
----



===Semi-finals===
Germany qualified for the final for the eighth time with a historic 7–1 win over Brazil – the biggest defeat in Brazilian football since 1920. Miroslav Klose&#x27;s goal in this match was his 16th throughout all World Cups, breaking the record he had previously shared with Ronaldo. Klose set another record by becoming the first player to appear in four World Cup semi-finals. Argentina reached their first final since 1990, and their fifth overall, after overcoming the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw at the end of extra time.



===Third place play-off===
The Netherlands defeated Brazil 3–0 to secure third place, the first for the Dutch team in their history. Overall, Brazil conceded 14 goals in the tournament; this was the most by a team at any single World Cup since 1986, and the most by a host nation in history, although their fourth-place finish still represented Brazil&#x27;s best result in a World Cup since their last win in 2002.

===Final===

The final featured Germany against Argentina for a record third time after 1986 and 1990.

This marked the first time that teams from the same continent had won three consecutive World Cups (following Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010). It was also the first time that a European nation had won the World Cup in the Americas. On aggregate Europe then had eleven victories, to South America&#x27;s nine.

==Statistics==

===Goalscorers===
In total, 171 goals were scored by a record 121 players, with five credited as own goals. Goals scored from penalty shoot-outs are not counted.
===Discipline===
The most notable disciplinary case was that of Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez, who was suspended for nine international matches and banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months, following a biting incident on Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. He was also fined CHF100,000. After an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Suárez was later allowed to participate in training and friendly matches with new club Barcelona.

===Awards===
The following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament:

;Technical Study Group
The members of the Technical Study Group, the committee that decided which players won the awards, were led by FIFA&#x27;s head of the Technical Division Jean-Paul Brigger and featured:
* Gérard Houllier
* Raul Arias
* Gabriel Calderón
* Ricki Herbert
* Abdel Moneim Hussein
* Kwok Ka Ming
* Ioan Lupescu
* Ginés Meléndez
* Tsuneyasu Miyamoto
* Sunday Oliseh
* Mixu Paatelainen
* Jaime Rodríguez
* Theodore Whitmore
There were changes to the voting procedure for awards for the 2014 edition: while in 2010 accredited media were allowed to vote for the Golden Ball award, in 2014 only the Technical Study Group could select the outcome.

===All-Star Team===
As was the case during the 2010 edition, FIFA released an All-Star Team based on the Castrol performance index in its official website.

===Dream Team===
FIFA also invited users of FIFA.com to elect their Dream Team.

===Prize money===
The total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA as US$576 million (including payments of $70 million to domestic clubs and $100 million as player insurances), a 37 percent increase from the amount allocated in the 2010 tournament. Before the tournament, each of the 32 entrants received $1.5 million for preparation costs. At the tournament, the prize money was distributed as follows:

* $8 million – To each team eliminated at the group stage (16 teams)
* $9 million – To each team eliminated in the round of 16 (8 teams)
* $14 million – To each team eliminated in the quarter-finals (4 teams)
* $20 million – Fourth placed team
* $22 million – Third placed team
* $25 million – Runner-up
* $35 million – Winner

==Final standings==
Per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws.


==Preparations and costs==
Costs of the tournament totalled $11.6 billion, making it the most expensive World Cup to date, until surpassed by 2018 FIFA World Cup which cost an estimated $14.2 billion. FIFA was expected to spend US$2 billion on staging the finals, with its greatest single expense being the US$576 million prize money pot.

Although organisers originally estimated costs of US$1.1 billion, a reported US$3.6 billion was ultimately spent on stadium works. Five of the chosen host cities had brand new venues built specifically for the World Cup, while the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in the capital Brasília was demolished and rebuilt, with the remaining six being extensively renovated.

An additional R$3 billion (US$1.3 billion, €960 million, £780 million at June 2014 rates) was earmarked by the Brazilian government for investment in infrastructure works and projects for use during the 2014 World Cup and beyond. However, the failed completion of many of the proposed works provoked discontent among some Brazilians.

The Brazilian government pledged US$900 million to be invested into security forces and that the tournament would be &quot;one of the most protected sports events in history.&quot;

==Marketing==

The marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the official mascot as well as an official video game that has been developed by EA Sports. As a partner of the German Football Association, part of German major airline Lufthansa&#x27;s fleet was branded &quot;Fanhansa&quot; for the time being. Branded planes flew the Germany national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.

The Sony Xperia Z2 was dubbed the &quot;official smartphone of the 2014 FIFA World Cup&quot;.

===Sponsorship===
The sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.

==Symbols==
===Mascot===
The official mascot of this World Cup was &quot;Fuleco&quot;

===Match ball===
The official match ball was &quot;Brazuca&quot;, manufactured by Adidas.

===Music===

The official song of the tournament was &quot;We Are One (Ole Ola)&quot; with vocals from Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte.

The official mascot song was &quot;Tatu Bom de Bola&quot;.

The official anthem was &quot;Dar um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)&quot;.

==Media==

For a fourth consecutive FIFA World Cup Finals, the coverage was provided by HBS (Host Broadcast Services), a subsidiary of Infront Sports &amp; Media. Sony was selected as the official equipment provider and built 12 bespoke high definition production 40-foot-long containers, one for each tournament venue, to house the extensive amount of equipment required. Each match utilised 37 standard camera plans, including Aerial and Cablecam, two Ultramotion cameras and dedicated cameras for interviews. The official tournament film, as well as three matches, will be filmed with ultra high definition technology (4K resolution), following a successful trial at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.

The broadcasting rights – covering television, radio, internet and mobile coverage – for the tournament were sold to media companies in each individual territory either directly by FIFA, or through licensed companies or organisations such as the European Broadcasting Union, Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana, International Media Content, Dentsu and RS International Broadcasting &amp; Sports Management. The sale of these rights accounted for an estimated 60% of FIFA&#x27;s income from staging a World Cup. The International Broadcast Centre was situated at the Riocentro in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro.

Worldwide, several games qualified as the most-watched sporting events in their country in 2014, including 42.9 million people in Brazil for the opening game between Brazil and Croatia, the 34.1 million in Japan who saw their team play Ivory Coast, and 34.7 million in Germany who saw their national team win the World Cup against Argentina, while the 24.7 million viewers during the game between the US and Portugal is joint with the 2010 final as the most-watched football game in the United States. According to FIFA, over 1 billion people tuned in worldwide to watch the final between Germany and Argentina.

==Controversies==

The 2014 FIFA World Cup generated various controversies, including demonstrations, some of which took place even before the tournament started. Furthermore, there were various issues with safety, including the death of eight workers and a fire during construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable makeshift staircase at the Maracanã Stadium, a monorail collapse, and the collapse of an unfinished overpass in Belo Horizonte. The houses of thousands of families living in Rio de Janeiro’s slums were cleared for redevelopments for the World Cup in spite of protests and resistance. Favela do Metrô, near the Maracanã Stadium, was completely destroyed as a result, having previously housed 700 families in 2010.

===Protests===

Prior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place outside the venue, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup. Both the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and FIFA president Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches at the 2013 tournament&#x27;s opening, which resulted in FIFA announcing that the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony would not feature any speeches. Further protests took place during the Confederations Cup as well as prior to and during the World Cup.

===Breaches into stadiums===

At the Group B match between Spain and Chile, around 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracanã Stadium forced their way into the stadium and caused damage to the media centre. Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the events, while others reached the stands. Earlier, about 20 Argentinians made a similar breach during Argentina&#x27;s Group F game against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the same stadium.

===Bridge collapse===

On 3 July 2014, an overpass under construction in Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured.

===Head injuries===
During the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious. The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players&#x27; union FIFPro, and from Michel D&#x27;Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.

Second, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing was in the World Cup Final.
