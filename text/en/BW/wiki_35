<text>Winston Churchill (November 10, 1871 – March 12, 1947) was an American best-selling novelist of the early 20th century.

He is nowadays overshadowed, even as a writer, by the more famous British statesman of the same name, to whom he was not related.

==Early life==
Churchill was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Edward Spalding Churchill by his marriage to Emma Bell Blaine. He attended Smith Academy in Missouri and the United States Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1894. At the Naval Academy, he was conspicuous in scholarship and also in general student activities. He became an expert fencer and he organized at Annapolis the first eight-oared crew, which he captained for two years. After graduation he became an editor of the &quot;Army and Navy Journal&quot;. He resigned from the U.S. Navy to pursue a writing career. In 1895, he became managing editor of the &quot;Cosmopolitan Magazine&quot;, but in less than a year he retired from that, to have more time for writing. While he would be most successful as a novelist, he was also a published poet and essayist.

==Career==
His first novel to appear in book form was &quot;The Celebrity&quot; (1898). However, &quot;Mr. Keegan&#x27;s Elopement&quot; had been published in 1896 as a magazine serial and was republished as an illustrated hardback book in 1903. Churchill&#x27;s next novel—&quot;Richard Carvel&quot; (1899) — was a phenomenal success. The novel was the third best-selling work of American fiction in 1899 and eighth-best in 1900, according to Alice Hackett&#x27;s &quot;70 Years of Best Sellers&quot;. It sold some two million copies in a nation of only 76 million people, and made Churchill rich. His other commercially successful novels included &quot;The Crisis&quot; (1901), &quot;The Crossing&quot; (1904), &quot;Coniston&quot; (1906), &quot;Mr. Crewe&#x27;s Career&quot; (1908) and &quot;The Inside of the Cup&quot; (1913), all of which ranked first on the best-selling American novel list in the years indicated.

Churchill&#x27;s early novels were historical, but his later works were set in contemporary America. He often sought to include his political ideas into his novels.
In 1898, Churchill commissioned Charles Platt to design a mansion in Cornish, New Hampshire. Churchill moved there the following year and named it Harlakenden House. From 1913 to 1915, he leased it to Woodrow Wilson, who used it as his summer residence. Churchill became involved in the Cornish Art Colony and went into politics, winning election to the state legislature in 1903 and 1905. In 1906, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor of New Hampshire. In 1912, he was nominated as the Progressive candidate for governor but did not win the election and did not seek public office again. In 1917, he toured the battlefields of World War I and wrote his first non-fiction work about what he saw.

Sometime after the move to Cornish, he took up painting in watercolors and became known for his landscapes. Some of his works are in the collections of the Hood Museum of Art (part of Hopkins Center for the Arts at Dartmouth College) in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site in Cornish, New Hampshire.

In 1919, Churchill decided to stop writing and withdrew from public life. He was gradually forgotten by the public. In 1923, Harlakenden House burned down. The Churchills moved to an 1838 Federal estate, part of the Cornish Colony called Windfield House (now called Hillside) at 23 Freeman Road in Plainfield, furnishing it with items saved from the fire. In 1940, &quot;The Uncharted Way&quot;, his first book in twenty years, was published. The book examined Churchill&#x27;s thoughts on religion. He did not seek to publicize the book and it received little attention. Shortly before his death, he said, &quot;It is very difficult now for me to think of myself as a writer of novels, as all that seems to belong to another life.&quot;

==Death==
Churchill died in Winter Park, Florida, in 1947 of a heart attack. He was predeceased in 1945 by his wife of fifty years, the former Mabel Harlakenden Hall. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 16) along New Hampshire Route 12A in Cornish.

Churchill and his wife had three children. Their son John Dwight Winston Churchill was married to Mary Deshon Hand, daughter of Judge Learned Hand. Another son Creighton Churchill was a well-known writer on wines. Journalist Chris Churchill of Albany, New York is his great-grandson.

==The British statesman==
In the 1890s, Churchill&#x27;s writings first came to be confused with those of the British writer with the same name. At that time, the American was the much better known of the two, and it was the Englishman who wrote to his American counterpart about the confusion their names were causing among their readers.

They agreed that the British Churchill should adopt the pen name &quot;Winston Spencer Churchill&quot;, using his full surname, &quot;Spencer-Churchill&quot;. After a few early editions this was abbreviated to &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot;—which remained the British Churchill&#x27;s pen name. The two men arranged to meet on two occasions when one of them happened to be in the other&#x27;s country, but were never closely acquainted.

Their lives had some other coincidental parallels. They both gained their tertiary education at service colleges and briefly served (during the same period) as officers in their respective countries&#x27; armed forces (one was a naval officer, the other an army officer). Both Churchills were keen amateur painters, as well as writers. Both were also politicians, although the British Churchill&#x27;s political career was far more illustrious.

<doc id="641995" wikidata="Q752718" url="?curid=641995" title="Asymptotic analysis">
<text>In mathematical analysis, asymptotic analysis, also known as asymptotics, is a method of describing limiting behavior.

As an illustration, suppose that we are interested in the properties of a function as becomes very large. If , then as becomes very large, the term becomes insignificant compared to . The function is said to be &quot;&quot;asymptotically equivalent&quot; to , as &quot;. This is often written symbolically as , which is read as &quot; is asymptotic to &quot;.

An example of an important asymptotic result is the prime number theorem. Let denote the prime-counting function (which is not directly related to the constant pi), i.e. is the number of prime numbers that are less than or equal to . Then the theorem states that
formula_1

Asymptotic analysis is commonly used in computer science as part of the analysis of algorithms and is often expressed there in terms of big O notation.

== Definition ==
Formally, given functions and , we define a binary relation
formula_2
if and only if 
formula_3

The symbol is the tilde. The relation is an equivalence relation on the set of functions of ; the functions and are said to be &quot;asymptotically equivalent&quot;. The domain of and can be any set for which the limit is defined: e.g. real numbers, complex numbers, positive integers.

The same notation is also used for other ways of passing to a limit: e.g. , , . The way of passing to the limit is often not stated explicitly, if it is clear from the context.

Although the above definition is common in the literature, it is problematic if is zero infinitely often as goes to the limiting value. For that reason, some authors use an alternative definition. The alternative definition, in little-o notation, is that if and only if
formula_4

This definition is equivalent to the prior definition if is not zero in some neighbourhood of the limiting value.

== Properties ==
If formula_5 and formula_6, then, under some mild conditions, the following hold:

* formula_7, for every real 
* formula_8 if formula_9
* formula_10
* formula_11

Such properties allow asymptotically equivalent functions to be freely exchanged in many algebraic expressions.

==Examples of asymptotic formulas==
* Factorial formula_12 —this is Stirling&#x27;s approximation
* Partition function For a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the partition function, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), gives the number of ways of writing the integer &quot;n&quot; as a sum of positive integers, where the order of addends is not considered. formula_13
* Airy function The Airy function, Ai(&quot;x&quot;), is a solution of the differential equation ; it has many applications in physics. formula_14
* Hankel functions formula_15

==Asymptotic expansion==

An asymptotic expansion of a function is in practice an expression of that function in terms of a series, the partial sums of which do not necessarily converge, but such that taking any initial partial sum provides an asymptotic formula for . The idea is that successive terms provide an increasingly accurate description of the order of growth of .

In symbols, it means we have formula_16 but also formula_17 and formula_18 for each fixed &quot;k&quot;. In view of the definition of the formula_19 symbol, the last equation means formula_20 in the little o notation, i.e., formula_21 is much smaller than formula_22

The relation formula_18 takes its full meaning if formula_24 for all &quot;k&quot;, which means the formula_25 form an asymptotic scale. In that case, some authors may abusively write formula_26 to denote the statement formula_27 One should however be careful that this is not a standard use of the formula_19 symbol, and that it does not correspond to the definition given in .

In the present situation, this relation formula_29 actually follows from combining steps &quot;k&quot; and &quot;k&quot;−1; by subtracting formula_30 from formula_31 one gets formula_32 i.e. formula_33

In case the asymptotic expansion does not converge, for any particular value of the argument there will be a particular partial sum which provides the best approximation and adding additional terms will decrease the accuracy. This optimal partial sum will usually have more terms as the argument approaches the limit value.

===Examples of asymptotic expansions===

* Gamma function formula_34
* Exponential integral formula_35
* Error function formula_36 where is the double factorial.

===Worked example===

Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence. For example, we might start with the ordinary series
formula_37

The expression on the left is valid on the entire complex plane formula_38, while the right hand side converges only for formula_39. Multiplying by formula_40 and integrating both sides yields
formula_41

The integral on the left hand side can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral. The integral on the right hand side, after the substitution formula_42, may be recognized as the gamma function. Evaluating both, one obtains the asymptotic expansion
formula_43

Here, the right hand side is clearly not convergent for any non-zero value of &quot;t&quot;. However, by keeping &quot;t&quot; small, and truncating the series on the right to a finite number of terms, one may obtain a fairly good approximation to the value of formula_44. Substituting formula_45 and noting that formula_46 results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article.

== Asymptotic distribution ==
In mathematical statistics, an asymptotic distribution is a hypothetical distribution that is in a sense the &quot;limiting&quot; distribution of a sequence of distributions. A distribution is an ordered set of random variables for , for some positive integer . An asymptotic distribution allows to range without bound, that is, is infinite.

A special case of an asymptotic distribution is when the late entries go to zero—that is, the go to 0 as goes to infinity. Some instances of &quot;asymptotic distribution&quot; refer only to this special case.

This is based on the notion of an asymptotic function which cleanly approaches a constant value (the &quot;asymptote&quot;) as the independent variable goes to infinity; &quot;clean&quot; in this sense meaning that for any desired closeness epsilon there is some value of the independent variable after which the function never differs from the constant by more than epsilon.

An asymptote is a straight line that a curve approaches but never meets or crosses. Informally, one may speak of the curve meeting the asymptote &quot;at infinity&quot; although this is not a precise definition. In the equation formula_47 &quot;y&quot; becomes arbitrarily small in magnitude as &quot;x&quot; increases.

==Applications==
Asymptotic analysis is used in several mathematical sciences. In statistics, asymptotic theory provides limiting approximations of the probability distribution of sample statistics, such as the likelihood ratio statistic and the expected value of the deviance. Asymptotic theory does not provide a method of evaluating the finite-sample distributions of sample statistics, however. Non-asymptotic bounds are provided by methods of approximation theory.

Examples of applications are the following.
* In applied mathematics, asymptotic analysis is used to build numerical methods to approximate equation solutions.
* In mathematical statistics and probability theory, asymptotics are used in analysis of long-run or large-sample behaviour of random variables and estimators.
* In computer science in the analysis of algorithms, considering the performance of algorithms.
* The behavior of physical systems, an example being statistical mechanics.
* In accident analysis when identifying the causation of crash through count modeling with large number of crash counts in a given time and space.

Asymptotic analysis is a key tool for exploring the ordinary and partial differential equations which arise in the mathematical modelling of real-world phenomena. An illustrative example is the derivation of the boundary layer equations from the full Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow. In many cases, the asymptotic expansion is in power of a small parameter, : in the boundary layer case, this is the nondimensional ratio of the boundary layer thickness to a typical length scale of the problem. Indeed, applications of asymptotic analysis in mathematical modelling often center around a nondimensional parameter which has been shown, or assumed, to be small through a consideration of the scales of the problem at hand.

Asymptotic expansions typically arise in the approximation of certain integrals (Laplace&#x27;s method, saddle-point method, method of steepest descent) or in the approximation of probability distributions (Edgeworth series). The Feynman graphs in quantum field theory are another example of asymptotic expansions which often do not converge.

=== Asymptotic versus Numerical Analysis ===
De Bruijn illustrates the use of asymptotics in the following dialog between Dr. N.A., a Numerical Analyst, and Dr. A.A., an Asymptotic Analyst:
N.A.: I want to evaluate my function formula_48 for large values of formula_49, with a relative error of at most 1%.

A.A.: formula_50.

N.A.: I am sorry, I don&#x27;t understand.

A.A.: formula_51

N.A.: But my value of formula_49 is only 100.

A.A.: Why did you not say so? My evaluations giveformula_53

N.A.: This is no news to me. I know already that formula_54.

A.A.: I can gain a little on some of my estimates. Now I find thatformula_55

N.A.: I asked for 1%, not for 20%.

A.A.: It is almost the best thing I possibly can get. Why don&#x27;t you take larger values of formula_49?

N.A.: !!! I think it&#x27;s better to ask my electronic computing machine.

Machine: f(100) = 0.01137 42259 34008 67153

A.A.: Haven&#x27;t I told you so? My estimate of 20% was not far off from the 14% of the real error.

N.A.: !!! . . . !

Some days later, Miss N.A. wants to know the value of f(1000), but her machine would take a month of computation to give the answer. She returns to her Asymptotic Colleague, and gets a fully satisfactory reply.

<text>The Staten Island Yankees were a minor league baseball team located in the New York City borough of Staten Island from 1999 to 2020. Nicknamed the &quot;Baby Bombers&quot;, the Yankees were the Class A Short Season affiliate of the New York Yankees and played in the New York–Penn League at Richmond County Bank Ballpark along the waterfront in St. George. The Yankees won six New York–Penn League championships (2000, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2011).

==History==
The franchise originated in 1983 as the Watertown Pirates (affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates), and became the Watertown Indians (affiliated with the Cleveland Indians) in 1989.

In 1999, in a deal brokered by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the Yankees affiliation was transferred from the Oneonta Yankees to the Watertown franchise, which was relocated and renamed the Staten Island Yankees. The Oneonta Yankees, in turn, became a Detroit Tigers affiliate and were renamed the Oneonta Tigers.

The Staten Island Yankees played their first two seasons at College of Staten Island Baseball Complex before moving into the Richmond County Bank Ballpark for the 2001 season.

The first SI Yankee to reach the major leagues as a New York Yankee was in 2003; pitcher Jason Anderson, pitching in relief in an 8–4 Yankee win over the Toronto Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre. (The first Staten Island Yankee to reach the majors for any team was Wily Mo Peña, who broke in with the Cincinnati Reds, in 2002.)

On March 26, 2006, the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; reported that the team&#x27;s majority owners, the Getzler family, were considering selling their 51% share of the team, and were asking for between three and five million dollars. The New York Yankees purchased the Getzlers’ interest in the team and in return hired Mandalay Sports Properties to run the day-to-day operations of the team. Part of the agreement was that the New York Yankees and Mandalay become equal partners with Mandalay owning 50% of the Staten Island Yankees.
In 2006, the Yankees were managed by Gaylen Pitts, noted for frequently being ejected from games. In a game on August 25, 2006, Pitts was ejected and then returned to the field in sandals after a batter was hit by a pitch in the 9th inning of a 21–6 victory over the Brooklyn Cyclones.

In 2007, the Yankees were managed by Mike Gillespie, who had led the 1998 USC Trojans to a College World Series championship. Gillespie led the Baby Bombers to their third consecutive playoff appearance before losing to the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2007 NYPL Playoffs, 2 games to none.

Former Florida Gator coach Pat McMahon managed the Yankees for the 2008 season.

Former major league catcher Josh Paul managed the Yankees for the 2009 and 2010 seasons. in 2010, due to Dave Eiland taking a leave of absence, SI Yankees manager Paul was summoned to fill in as the New York Yankees bullpen coach, during which time former major leaguer Jody Reed filled in as the interim manager for the Staten Island Yankees.

On June 20, 2016, the team launched a campaign to rename the organization starting with the 2017 season. On September 8, 2016, the potential names were whittled down to five, with an online vote beginning on the team&#x27;s website from that date; the candidate names were the Bridge Trolls, Heroes, Killer Bees, Pizza Rats, and Rock Pigeons. Ultimately, the team decided to retain the Yankees moniker but to call itself the Staten Island Pizza Rats for select games as an alternate identity.

Prior to the 2020 season, it was announced that the team would be shuttered when the MLB/MiLB agreement ended at the conclusion of the 2020 season under a proposed plan calling for the Short Season Class A designation to be eliminated. The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. On November 7, 2020, the New York Yankees announced that they were withdrawing from Staten Island as well as abandoning their affiliation with the Trenton Thunder as they were moving forward with their new Double-A affiliate: the Somerset Patriots, but they would seek to place a team from the independent Atlantic League at Richmond County Bank Ballpark in 2021. On December 3, 2020, the Staten Island Yankees announced that the club would cease operations. The Staten Island FerryHawks began play in the Atlantic League in 2022.

==Year-by-year record==
==Notable alumni==

Over a hundred Staten Island Yankees players reached the major leagues, not including MLB players who were with the team on a rehab assignment.

The following MLB players made rehab appearances with the Staten Island Yankees:
*Orlando Hernandez (2001)
*José Contreras (2003)
*Kevin Brown (2004)
*Steve Karsay (2004)
*Felix Rodríguez (2005)
*Octavio Dotel (2006)
*Jeff Karstens (2007) – the only former SI Yankee to return on an MLB rehab assignment
*Darrell Rasner (2007)
*Jonathan Albaladejo (2008)
*Phil Hughes (2011)

==Mascots==
The original Staten Island Yankees Mascot was Scooter the &quot;Holy Cow.&quot; A combination of the nickname of former New York Yankees shortstop and broadcaster Phil &quot;Scooter&quot; Rizzuto and his commentating catch phrase &quot;Holy Cow!&quot; Scooter debuted for the Staten Island Yankees when the franchise relocated from Watertown, New York, in 1999. In summer 2003, the Baby Bombers debuted Scooter&#x27;s sisters Red and Huckleberry (or &quot;Huck&quot;). Scooter and his sisters were a staple at SI Yankee games, leading fan rallies and between-inning on-field games. The cows were known to have a The Three Stooges-like relationship in which Red and Huck often teamed up to trick and trap Scooter

<doc id="641998" wikidata="Q3327225" url="?curid=641998" title="Dave Catching">
<text>David Catching (born June 7, 1961) is an American musician from Memphis, Tennessee. He is a founding member of the California stoner rock bands earthlings? from 1993–present, and Queens of the Stone Age from 1996-2000, a former touring member of Eagles of Death Metal from 2003-2017 and the current operator of the Rancho De La Luna recording studio.

== Career ==

Catching has played the guitar for well-known hard rock bands Eagles of Death Metal, Queens of the Stone Age, Tex and the Horseheads, as well as Mark Lanegan, The Ringling Sisters, earthlings?, Mondo Generator and the Masters of Reality, Yellow #5, and Gnarltones.

Catching has been associated with the desert country rock band, Smith &amp; Pyle. He contributed to the debut album of country rock duo Smith &amp; Pyle, &quot;It&#x27;s OK to be Happy&quot;, which was recorded at his recording studio Rancho de la Luna and released in 2008. He currently resides in Joshua Tree, California.

Catching was on stage with Eagles of Death Metal during the November 2015 Paris attacks, and escaped the Bataclan with the rest of the band. Catching talked about this at length on the show Conan Neutron&#x27;s Protonic Reversal, Rolling Stone and other media.

== Musical equipment ==
With earthlings?, Mojave Lords and other live performances Catching plays a 1984 Gibson Les Paul, gifted to him by his brother in law, Frank Watts. He also uses for live shows and recording Echopark Guitars Albert 58, and Yamaha AES 1500. His pedalboard consists of Earthquaker Devices, Dispatch Master and Astral Destiny, a T.C. Electronics Polytune 2 tuner, and Spark, Jim Dunlop Wah pedal and Rotovibe pedal, Origin Me-Q Drive, Dr No Effects Colossus, Solid Gold FX Lysis and EM-III, Boss DD#3 Delay, Radial BigShot, into a combination of Bruce Zinky Tremoverb, and Mofo, or Lanham Amps Dragonslayer with Colby Amps Elpico. With the Eagles of Death Metal, Catching played his 1967 Gibson Flying V through a tuner and distortion pedal and Supro amplifier with a 2x12 cabinet and Orange Amplifiers. He also used an Ampeg Dan Armstrong guitar when playing with Eagles of Death Metal. Catching also uses HipStrap vintage styled guitar straps. He is endorsed by and uses Ernie Ball ultra slinky guitar strings, coiled red Bullet Cable.

Catching released a signature fuzz wah pedal in 2015, the Roadrunner, through Dr. No Effects.

In 2023 partnered with Grancasino Factory to imagine and develop the F.R.E.D. or Frequency Re-arranging Experimentation Device, cited by Catching as a tribute to Fred Drake, his departed former partner in Rancho de la Luna as &#x27;an unequalled sonic enhancement device befitting such a fantastic, uniquely wonderful, talented man as Fred Drake

From 1993-2015 with earthlings?, he used his 1958 Fender Stratocaster or his 1972 double cutaway Gibson Les Paul through a tuner and a distortion Rat pedal. His Les Paul is 1 of 6 ever made by Strings &amp; Things in Memphis, Tennessee. Other guitars were bought by Ace Frehley, Jeff Beck, Pat Travers, and Michael Woods, guitarist for the group America. Photos have circulated of Dave&#x27;s very guitar nearly being bought by Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer fame, but opting out at the last minute for an acoustic bass.

Catching co-founded Rancho de la Luna recording studio with Fred Drake in 1993. After Drake&#x27;s death in 2002, Catching has since run the studio and continues to this day, hosting such musical acts as Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, Arctic Monkeys, Iggy Pop, Daniel Lanois and many others

<text>The common hill myna (Gracula religiosa), sometimes spelled &quot;mynah&quot; and formerly simply known as the hill myna or myna bird, is the myna most commonly sighted in aviculture, where it is often simply referred to by the latter two names. It is a member of the starling family (Sturnidae), resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Sri Lanka hill myna, a former subspecies of &quot;G. religiosa&quot;, is now generally accepted as a separate species &quot;G. ptilogenys&quot;. The Enggano hill myna (&quot;G. enganensis&quot;) and Nias hill myna (&quot;G. robusta&quot;) are also widely accepted as specifically distinct, and many authors favor treating the southern hill myna (&quot;G. indica&quot;) from the Nilgiris and elsewhere in the Western Ghats of India as a separate species.

The common hill myna is a popular talking bird. Its specific name &quot;&quot; may allude to the practice of teaching mynas to repeat prayers.

==Taxonomy==
The common hill myna was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Gracula religiosa&quot;. The type location is the Indonesian island of Java. The genus name is from Latin &quot;graculus&quot;, an unknown bird sometimes identified as the western jackdaw. The specific epithet &quot;religiosa&quot; is from Latin &quot;religiosus&quot; meaning &quot;sacred&quot;.

Seven subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;G. r. peninsularis&quot; Whistler &amp; Kinnear, 1933 – central east India
* &quot;G. r. intermedia&quot; Hay, 1845 – north India to south China, Indochina and Thailand
* &quot;G. r. andamanensis&quot; (Beavan, 1867) – Coco, Andaman and Nicobar Islands
* &quot;G. r. religiosa&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo and nearby islands
* &quot;G. r. miotera&quot; Oberholser, 1917 – Simeulue (west of north Sumatra) (sometimes synonymised with the nominate &quot;G. r. religiosa&quot;)
* &quot;G. r. batuensis&quot; Finsch, 1899 – Batu Islands and Mentawai Islands (off west Sumatra)
* &quot;G. r. palawanensis&quot; (Sharpe, 1890) – Palawan (southwest Philippines)

The southern hill myna (&quot;Gracula indica&quot;), the Nias hill myna (&quot;Gracula robusta&quot;), the Enggano hill myna (&quot;Gracula enganensis&quot;) and the Tenggara hill myna (&quot;Gracula venerata&quot;) have all been classified as subspecies.

==Description==
This is a stocky jet-black myna, with bright orange-yellow patches of naked skin and fleshy wattles on the side of its head and nape. At about 29 cm length, it is somewhat larger than the common myna (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;).

It is overall green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. Its large, white wing patches are obvious in flight, but mostly covered when the bird is sitting. The bill and strong legs are bright yellow, and there are yellow wattles on the nape and under the eye. These differ conspicuously in shape from the naked eye-patch of the common myna and bank myna (&quot;A. ginginianus&quot;), and more subtly vary between the different hill mynas from South Asia: in the common hill myna, they extend from the eye to the nape, where they join, while the Sri Lanka hill myna has a single wattle across the nape and extending a bit towards the eyes. In the southern hill myna, the wattles are separate and curve towards the top of the head. The Nias and Enggano hill mynas differ in details of the facial wattles, and size, particularly that of the bill.

Sexes are similar; juveniles have a duller bill. The subspecies differ in size, in the pattern of wattles on the head and in the glossiness of the plumage.
A 2020 study found that the subspecies &quot;G. religiosa miotera&quot; likely represents a distinct species and was likely driven to extinction in the wild in the late 2010s due unsustainable collecting for the wildlife trade. The paper recommends rescuing the last genetically pure captive individuals for the purpose of captive breeding. The International Ornithological Congress tentatively recognises it as a subspecies.

===Vocalisations===

The common hill myna is often detected by its loud, shrill, descending whistles followed by other calls. It is most vocal at dawn and dusk, when it is found in small groups in forest clearings high in the canopy.

Both sexes can produce an extraordinarily wide range of loud calls – whistles, wails, screeches, and gurgles, sometimes melodious and often very human-like in quality. Each individual has a repertoire of three to 13 such call types, which may be shared with some near neighbours of the same sex, being learned when young. Dialects change rapidly with distance, such that birds living more than 15 km apart have no call-types in common with one another.

Unlike some other birds, such as the greater racket-tailed drongo (&quot;Dicrurus paradiseus&quot;), the common hill myna does not imitate other birds in the wild, although it is a widely held misconception that they do. On the other hand, in captivity, they are among the most renowned mimics, the only bird, perhaps, on par with the grey parrot (&quot;Psittacus erithacus&quot;). They can learn to reproduce many everyday sounds, particularly the human voice, and even whistled tunes, with astonishing accuracy and clarity.

==Distribution and ecology==

This myna is a resident breeder from Kumaon division in India (80° E longitude) east through Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, the lower Himalayas, terai and foothills up to 2,000 m ASL. Its range continues east through Southeast Asia northeastwards to southern China, and via Thailand southeastwards across northern Indonesia to Palawan in the Philippines. It is virtually extinct in Bangladesh due to habitat destruction and overexploitation for the pet trade. A feral population on Christmas Island has likewise disappeared. Introduced populations exist in Saint Helena, Puerto Rico and perhaps in the mainland United States and possibly elsewhere; feral birds require at least a warm subtropical climate to persist.

This myna is almost entirely arboreal, moving in large, noisy groups of half a dozen or so, in tree-tops at the edge of the forest. It hops sideways along the branch, unlike the characteristic jaunty walk of other mynas. Like most starlings, the hill myna is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects.

They build a nest in a hole in a tree. The usual clutch is two or three eggs. There is no sexual dimorphism in these birds, which results in a limited possibility of choosing the sex to work with for mating.

===Pet trade and conservation===
The hill mynas are popular cage birds, renowned for their ability to imitate speech. The widely distributed common hill myna is the one most frequently seen in aviculture. Demand outstrips captive breeding capacity, so they are rarely found in pet stores and usually purchased directly from breeders or importers who can certify the birds are traded legally.

This species is widely distributed and locally common, and if adult stocks are safeguarded, it is able to multiply quickly. On a worldwide scale, the IUCN thus considers the common hill myna a Species of Least Concern. But in the 1990s, nearly 20,000 wild-caught birds, mostly adults and juveniles, were brought into trade each year. In the central part of its range, &quot;G. r. intermedia&quot; populations have declined markedly, especially in Thailand, which supplied much of the thriving Western market. Its neighbor countries, from where exports were often limited due to political or military reasons, nevertheless supplied a burgeoning domestic demand, and demand in the entire region continues to be very high. In 1992, Thailand had the common hill myna put on CITES Appendix III, to safeguard its stocks against collapsing. In 1997, at the request of the Netherlands and the Philippines, the species was uplisted to CITES Appendix II. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands subspecies &quot;G. r. andamanensis&quot; and (if valid) &quot;G. r. halibrecta&quot;, described as &quot;exceedingly common&quot; in 1874, qualified as Near Threatened in 1991. The former is not at all common anymore in the Nicobar Islands and the latter—if distinct—has a very limited range.

Elsewhere, such as on the Philippines and in Laos, the decline has been more localized. It is also becoming increasingly rare in the regions of northeastern India due to capture of fledged birds for the illegal pet trade. In the Garo Hills region, however, the locals make artificial nests of a split-bamboo framework covered with grass, and put them up in accessible positions in tall trees in a forest clearing or at the edge of a small village to entice the mynas to breed there. The villagers are thus able to extract the young at the proper time for easy hand-rearing, making common hill myna farming a profitable, small-scale cottage industry. It helps to preserve the environment, because the breeding birds are not removed from the population, while habitat destruction is curtailed because the mynas will desert areas of extensive logging and prefer more natural forest to plantations. As the mynas can be somewhat of a pest of fruit trees when too numerous, an additional benefit to the locals is the inexpensive means of controlling the myna population: failing stocks can be bolstered by putting out more nests than can be harvested, while the maximum proportion of nestlings are taken when the population becomes too large.

<text>The southern hill myna (Gracula indica) is a member of the starling family. It is a resident of the forested regions of south India and Sri Lanka. This species moves around in flocks in the forest, and members of a flock keep in contact with a wide range of vocalizations.

== Etymology ==
The French word for the bird &quot;mainate&quot; is probably derived from the Indo-Portuguese mainato, from the name of a songbird living near water, and is probably a metaphor since it refers to a man whose job is to wash the clothes of others.

== Description ==
The southern hill myna has a shiny black plumage. It generally measures about twenty centimeters. It can live between 15 and 30 years. The legs are yellow, the beak is bright orange at the base and yellow at the tip. It has white spots on the primary remiges. Like other species of hill myna, the southern hill myna has yellow wattles on the head.

== Habitats and behavior ==
The southern hill myna is present in southwestern India and Sri Lanka. It inhabits tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, mountains, mangrove forests and plantation areas. It is usually found high in the canopy, moving in large noisy groups of about half a dozen, in treetops at the edge of the forest. It hops sideways along the branch. Like most starlings, the hill myna is omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects. 

Its voice is melodious, it is able to emit various croaks and calls. The hill myna is considered to be one of the best talking birds, often imitating human sounds and voice, better than parrots. It is also bred in captivity for this particularity. The southern hill myna is claimed to be less vocally gifted than the common hill myna, a very similar species whose range does not overlap.

== Reproduction ==
It builds a nest in a hole in a tree. They are usually two or three eggs in the nest. Male and female birds look alike. 

== Conservation status ==
Although the population is declining it is considered &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the IUCN.

<doc id="642006" wikidata="Q2058297" url="?curid=642006" title="Laplace's method">
<text>In mathematics, Laplace&#x27;s method, named after Pierre-Simon Laplace, is a technique used to approximate integrals of the form

:formula_1

where formula_2 is a twice-differentiable function, formula_3 is a large number, and the endpoints formula_4 and formula_5 could be infinite. This technique was originally presented in the book by .

In Bayesian statistics, Laplace&#x27;s approximation can refer to either approximating the posterior normalizing constant with Laplace&#x27;s method or approximating the posterior distribution with a Gaussian centered at the maximum a posteriori estimate. Laplace approximations are used in the integrated nested Laplace approximations method for fast approximations of Bayesian inference.

==Concept==
Let the function formula_6 have a unique global maximum at formula_7. formula_8 is a constant here. The following two functions are considered:

:formula_9

Then, formula_7 is the global maximum of formula_11 and formula_12 as well. Hence:

:formula_13

As &quot;M&quot; increases, the ratio for formula_12 will grow exponentially, while the ratio for formula_11 does not change. Thus, significant contributions to the integral of this function will come only from points formula_16 in a neighborhood of formula_7, which can then be estimated.

==General theory==
To state and motivate the method, one must make several assumptions. It is assumed that formula_7 is not an endpoint of the interval of integration and that the values formula_6 cannot be very close to formula_20 unless formula_16 is close to formula_7.

formula_6 can be expanded around &quot;x&quot;0 by Taylor&#x27;s theorem,

:formula_24

where formula_25 (see: big O notation).

Since formula_2 has a global maximum at formula_7, and formula_7 is not an endpoint, it is a stationary point, i.e. formula_29. Therefore, the second-order Taylor polynomial approximating formula_6 is

:formula_31

Then, just one more step is needed to get a Gaussian distribution. Since formula_7 is a global maximum of the function formula_2 it can be stated, by definition of the second derivative, that formula_34, thus giving the relation

formula_35

for formula_16 close to formula_7. The integral can then be approximated with:

:formula_38

If formula_39 this latter integral becomes a Gaussian integral if we replace the limits of integration by formula_40 and formula_41; when formula_3 is large this creates only a small error because the exponential decays very fast away from formula_7. Computing this Gaussian integral we obtain:

:formula_44

A generalization of this method and extension to arbitrary precision is provided by the book .

===Formal statement and proof===

Suppose formula_6 is a twice continuously differentiable function on formula_46 and there exists a unique point formula_47 such that:

:formula_48

Then:

:formula_49
Lower bound: Let formula_50. Since formula_51 is continuous there exists formula_52 such that if formula_53 then formula_54 By Taylor&#x27;s Theorem, for any formula_55

:formula_56

Then we have the following lower bound:

:formula_57

where the last equality was obtained by a change of variables

:formula_58

Remember formula_59 so we can take the square root of its negation.

If we divide both sides of the above inequality by

:formula_60

and take the limit we get:

:formula_61

since this is true for arbitrary formula_62 we get the lower bound:

:formula_63

Note that this proof works also when formula_64 or formula_65 (or both).

Upper bound: The proof is similar to that of the lower bound but there are a few inconveniences. Again we start by picking an formula_66 but in order for the proof to work we need formula_62 small enough so that formula_68 Then, as above, by continuity of formula_51 and Taylor&#x27;s Theorem we can find formula_70 so that if formula_71, then

:formula_72

Lastly, by our assumptions (assuming formula_73 are finite) there exists an formula_74 such that if formula_75, then formula_76.

Then we can calculate the following upper bound:

:formula_77

If we divide both sides of the above inequality by

:formula_78

and take the limit we get:

:formula_79

Since formula_62 is arbitrary we get the upper bound:

:formula_81

And combining this with the lower bound gives the result.

Note that the above proof obviously fails when formula_64 or formula_83 (or both). To deal with these cases, we need some extra assumptions. A sufficient (not necessary) assumption is that for formula_84

:formula_85

and that the number formula_86 as above exists (note that this must be an assumption in the case when the interval formula_87 is infinite). The proof proceeds otherwise as above, but with a slightly different approximation of integrals:

:formula_88

When we divide by

:formula_89

we get for this term

:formula_90

whose limit as formula_91 is formula_92. The rest of the proof (the analysis of the interesting term) proceeds as above.

The given condition in the infinite interval case is, as said above, sufficient but not necessary. However, the condition is fulfilled in many, if not in most, applications: the condition simply says that the integral we are studying must be well-defined (not infinite) and that the maximum of the function at formula_7 must be a &quot;true&quot; maximum (the number formula_94 must exist). There is no need to demand that the integral is finite for formula_95 but it is enough to demand that the integral is finite for some formula_96
This method relies on 4 basic concepts such as
:1. Relative error
The “approximation” in this method is related to the relative error and not the absolute error. Therefore, if we set

:formula_97

the integral can be written as

:formula_98

where formula_99 is a small number when formula_3 is a large number obviously and the relative error will be
:formula_101

Now, let us separate this integral into two parts: formula_102 region and the rest.

:2. formula_103 around the stationary point when formula_3 is large enough

Let’s look at the Taylor expansion of formula_105 around &quot;x&quot;0 and translate &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; because we do the comparison in y-space, we will get

:formula_106

Note that formula_29 because formula_7 is a stationary point. From this equation you will find that the terms higher than second derivative in this Taylor expansion is suppressed as the order of formula_109 so that formula_110 will get closer to the Gaussian function as shown in figure. Besides,

:formula_111

:3. The larger formula_3 is, the smaller range of formula_16 is related

Because we do the comparison in y-space, formula_114 is fixed in formula_102 which will cause formula_116; however, formula_99 is inversely proportional to formula_118, the chosen region of formula_16 will be smaller when formula_3 is increased.

:4. If the integral in Laplace&#x27;s method converges, the contribution of the region which is not around the stationary point of the integration of its relative error will tend to zero as formula_3 grows.

Relying on the 3rd concept, even if we choose a very large &quot;Dy&quot;, &quot;sDy&quot; will finally be a very small number when formula_3 is increased to a huge number. Then, how can we guarantee the integral of the rest will tend to 0 when formula_3 is large enough?

The basic idea is to find a function formula_124 such that formula_125 and the integral of formula_126 will tend to zero when formula_3 grows. Because the exponential function of formula_128 will be always larger than zero as long as formula_124 is a real number, and this exponential function is proportional to formula_130 the integral of formula_131 will tend to zero. For simplicity, choose formula_124 as a tangent through the point formula_133 as shown in the figure:

If the interval of the integration of this method is finite, we will find that no matter formula_6 is continue in the rest region, it will be always smaller than formula_124 shown above when formula_3 is large enough. By the way, it will be proved later that the integral of formula_126 will tend to zero when formula_3 is large enough.

If the interval of the integration of this method is infinite, formula_124 and formula_6 might always cross to each other. If so, we cannot guarantee that the integral of formula_131 will tend to zero finally. For example, in the case of formula_142 formula_143 will always diverge. Therefore, we need to require that formula_144 can converge for the infinite interval case. If so, this integral will tend to zero when formula_145 is large enough and we can choose this formula_145 as the cross of formula_124 and formula_148

You might ask why not choose formula_149 as a convergent integral? Let me use an example to show you the reason. Suppose the rest part of formula_6 is formula_151 then formula_152 and its integral will diverge; however, when formula_153 the integral of formula_154 converges. So, the integral of some functions will diverge when formula_3 is not a large number, but they will converge when formula_3 is large enough.
Based on these four concepts, we can derive the relative error of this method.

==Other formulations==
Laplace&#x27;s approximation is sometimes written as

:formula_157

where formula_12 is positive.

Importantly, the accuracy of the approximation depends on the variable of integration, that is, on what stays in formula_159 and what goes into formula_160
First, use formula_161 to denote the global maximum, which will simplify this derivation. We are interested in the relative error, written as formula_162,

:formula_163

where

:formula_164

So, if we let

:formula_165

and formula_166, we can get

:formula_167

since formula_168.

For the upper bound, note that formula_169 thus we can separate this integration into 5 parts with 3 different types (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Therefore,

:formula_170

where formula_171 and formula_172 are similar, let us just calculate formula_171 and formula_174 and formula_175 are similar, too, I’ll just calculate formula_174.

For formula_171, after the translation of formula_178, we can get

:formula_179

This means that as long as formula_180 is large enough, it will tend to zero.

For formula_174, we can get

:formula_182

where

:formula_183

and formula_184 should have the same sign of formula_185 during this region. Let us choose formula_124 as the tangent across the point at formula_133 , i.e. formula_188 which is shown in the figure

From this figure you can find that when formula_99 or formula_180 gets smaller, the region satisfies the above inequality will get larger. Therefore, if we want to find a suitable formula_124 to cover the whole formula_6 during the interval of formula_174, formula_180 will have an upper limit. Besides, because the integration of formula_195 is simple, let me use it to estimate the relative error contributed by this formula_174.

Based on Taylor expansion, we can get

:formula_197

and

:formula_198

and then substitute them back into the calculation of formula_174; however, you can find that the remainders of these two expansions are both inversely proportional to the square root of formula_3, let me drop them out to beautify the calculation. Keeping them is better, but it will make the formula uglier.

:formula_201

Therefore, it will tend to zero when formula_180 gets larger, but don&#x27;t forget that the upper bound of formula_180 should be considered during this calculation.

About the integration near formula_204, we can also use Taylor&#x27;s Theorem to calculate it. When formula_205

:formula_206

and you can find that it is inversely proportional to the square root of formula_3. In fact, formula_208 will have the same behave when formula_184 is a constant.

Conclusively, the integral near the stationary point will get smaller as formula_118 gets larger, and the rest parts will tend to zero as long as formula_180 is large enough; however, we need to remember that formula_180 has an upper limit which is decided by whether the function formula_124 is always larger than formula_214 in the rest region. However, as long as we can find one formula_124 satisfying this condition, the upper bound of formula_180 can be chosen as directly proportional to formula_118 since formula_124 is a tangent across the point of formula_214 at formula_133. So, the bigger formula_3 is, the bigger formula_180 can be.
In the multivariate case, where formula_223 is a formula_145-dimensional vector and formula_225 is a scalar function of formula_223, Laplace&#x27;s approximation is usually written as:

:formula_227

where formula_228 is the Hessian matrix of formula_2 evaluated at formula_230 and where formula_231 denotes matrix determinant. Analogously to the univariate case, the Hessian is required to be negative-definite.

By the way, although formula_223 denotes a formula_145-dimensional vector, the term formula_234 denotes an infinitesimal volume here, i.e. formula_235.

==Steepest descent extension==
In extensions of Laplace&#x27;s method, complex analysis, and in particular Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, is used to find a contour &quot;of steepest descent&quot; for an (asymptotically with large &quot;M&quot;) equivalent integral, expressed as a line integral. In particular, if no point &quot;x&quot;0 where the derivative of formula_2 vanishes exists on the real line, it may be necessary to deform the integration contour to an optimal one, where the above analysis will be possible. Again, the main idea is to reduce, at least asymptotically, the calculation of the given integral to that of a simpler integral that can be explicitly evaluated. See the book of Erdelyi (1956) for a simple discussion (where the method is termed &quot;steepest descents&quot;).

The appropriate formulation for the complex &quot;z&quot;-plane is

:formula_237

for a path passing through the saddle point at &quot;z&quot;0. Note the explicit appearance of a minus sign to indicate the direction of the second derivative: one must &quot;not&quot; take the modulus. Also note that if the integrand is meromorphic, one may have to add residues corresponding to poles traversed while deforming the contour (see for example section 3 of Okounkov&#x27;s paper &quot;Symmetric functions and random partitions&quot;).

==Further generalizations==
An extension of the &quot;steepest descent method&quot; is the so-called &quot;nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method&quot;. Here, instead of integrals, one needs to evaluate asymptotically solutions of Riemann–Hilbert factorization problems.

Given a contour &quot;C&quot; in the complex sphere, a function formula_2 defined on that contour and a special point, such as infinity, a holomorphic function &quot;M&quot; is sought away from &quot;C&quot;, with prescribed jump across &quot;C&quot;, and with a given normalization at infinity. If formula_2 and hence &quot;M&quot; are matrices rather than scalars this is a problem that in general does not admit an explicit solution.

An asymptotic evaluation is then possible along the lines of the linear stationary phase/steepest descent method. The idea is to reduce asymptotically the solution of the given Riemann–Hilbert problem to that of a simpler, explicitly solvable, Riemann–Hilbert problem. Cauchy&#x27;s theorem is used to justify deformations of the jump contour.

The nonlinear stationary phase was introduced by Deift and Zhou in 1993, based on earlier work of Its. A (properly speaking) nonlinear steepest descent method was introduced by Kamvissis, K. McLaughlin and P. Miller in 2003, based on previous work of Lax, Levermore, Deift, Venakides and Zhou. As in the linear case, &quot;steepest descent contours&quot; solve a min-max problem. In the nonlinear case they turn out to be &quot;S-curves&quot; (defined in a different context back in the 80s by Stahl, Gonchar and Rakhmanov).

The nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method has applications to the theory of soliton equations and integrable models, random matrices and combinatorics.

==Median-point approximation generalization==

In the generalization, evaluation of the integral is considered equivalent to finding the norm of the distribution with density

:formula_240

Denoting the cumulative distribution formula_241, if there is a diffeomorphic Gaussian distribution with density

:formula_242

the norm is given by

:formula_243

and the corresponding diffeomorphism is

:formula_244

where formula_245 denotes cumulative standard normal distribution function.

In general, any distribution diffeomorphic to the Gaussian distribution has density

:formula_246

and the median-point is mapped to the median of the Gaussian distribution. Matching the logarithm of the density functions and their derivatives at the median point up to a given order yields a system of equations that determine the approximate values of formula_247 and formula_11.

The approximation was introduced in 2019 by D. Makogon and C. Morais Smith primarily in the context of partition function evaluation for a system of interacting fermions.

==Complex integrals==
For complex integrals in the form:

:formula_249

with formula_250 we make the substitution &quot;t&quot; = &quot;iu&quot; and the change of variable formula_251 to get the bilateral Laplace transform:

:formula_252

We then split &quot;g&quot;(&quot;c&quot; + &quot;ix&quot;) in its real and complex part, after which we recover &quot;u&quot; = &quot;t&quot;/&quot;i&quot;. This is useful for inverse Laplace transforms, the Perron formula and complex integration.

==Example: Stirling&#x27;s approximation==
Laplace&#x27;s method can be used to derive Stirling&#x27;s approximation

:formula_253

for a large integer &quot;N&quot;. From the definition of the Gamma function, we have

:formula_254

Now we change variables, letting formula_255 so that formula_256 Plug these values back in to obtain

:formula_257

This integral has the form necessary for Laplace&#x27;s method with

:formula_258

which is twice-differentiable:

:formula_259
:formula_260

The maximum of formula_261 lies at &quot;z&quot;0 = 1, and the second derivative of formula_261 has the value −1 at this point. Therefore, we obtain

:formula_263

<doc id="642009" wikidata="Q5029384" url="?curid=642009" title="Canada Health and Social Transfer">
<text>The Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST) was a system of block transfer payments from the Canadian government to provincial governments to pay for health care, post-secondary education and welfare, in place from the 1996–97 fiscal year until the 2004–05 fiscal year. It was split into the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) and Canada Social Transfer (CST) effective April 1, 2004, to provide greater accountability and transparency for federal health funding.

==Background==
The CHST was announced in the 1995 Canadian federal budget as an amalgamation of two federal programs prior to 1996: 
* The Established Programs Financing program, which paid for health care and post-secondary education and was established in 1977 ;
* And the Canada Assistance Plan, which supported social assistance and was established in 1966.

Under the Constitution of Canada, health, education and social assistance are all areas of provincial responsibility and authority. The federal government does not directly participate in the administration of government services in these areas, though federal money through the CHST and its successors is used to fund them. But unlike equalization payments, which provinces can spend on anything, money distributed through the CHST is conditional and must be spent on health, post-secondary education or welfare. Legislation such as the Canada Health Act specify standards that the provinces must maintain in order to receive funding.

The rate of increase to the amounts in the transfer are driven by economic growth, due to the underlying program being designed on the basis of the &quot;transfer&quot; of tax points, however, occasional supplements to the program can be made either through increases in the base rate, such $11 billion more in funding per year through bilateral amendment agreements in 2016, or through special time-limited funding, such as the 2006 Wait Time Reductions Fund, which provided funding over a decade. The CHST and its successors consist of both cash transfers and tax transfers. Cash transfers are direct transfers of money from the federal government to the provinces. Tax transfers work because both federal and provincial governments collect personal and corporate income tax. A tax transfer involves the federal government reducing its income tax rates, leaving the provinces room (&quot;tax points&quot;) by which they can increase their own taxes (and thus their revenues) without increasing the total tax burden on their citizens.

==Criticism==
The amount of transfer payments from the federal to the provincial governments is always controversial, particularly in the area of health care, which is of particular importance to Canadians. The premiers of Canadian provinces allege that federal funding has decreased markedly since the beginning of publicly funded health care, from fifty to sixteen cents of every dollar. Some argue against the principle of the Canada Health Transfer cash contributions being at 50%, arguing that reforms in 1977 led to the removal of that cost sharing principle due to incorporating the transfer of tax points.

Critics of the CHST, CHT and CST note that the programs have allowed the federal government to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction by giving Ottawa a power through the threat of withdrawing the transfers to any province that administers programs contrary to federal requirements.

<doc id="642012" wikidata="Q13560779" url="?curid=642012" title="Gullah">
<text>The Gullah () are a subgroup of the African American ethnic group, who predominantly live in the Lowcountry region of the U.S. states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida within the coastal plain and the Sea Islands. Their language and culture have preserved a significant influence of Africanisms as a result of their historical geographic isolation and the community&#x27;s relation to its shared history and identity. 

Historically, the Gullah region extended from the Cape Fear area on North Carolina&#x27;s coast south to the vicinity of Jacksonville on Florida&#x27;s coast. The Gullah people and their language are also called Geechee, which may be derived from the name of the Ogeechee River near Savannah, Georgia. &quot;Gullah&quot; is a term that was originally used to designate the creole dialect of English spoken by Gullah and Geechee people. Over time, its speakers have used this term to formally refer to their creole language and distinctive ethnic identity as a people. The Georgia communities are distinguished by identifying as either &quot;Freshwater Geechee&quot; or &quot;Saltwater Geechee&quot;, depending on whether they live on the mainland or the Sea Islands.

Because of a period of relative isolation from whites while working on large plantations in rural areas, the Africans, enslaved from a variety of Central and West African ethnic groups, developed a creole culture that has preserved much of their African linguistic and cultural heritage from various peoples; in addition, they absorbed new influences from the region. According to the Gullah/Geechee Nation website, many Gullah/Geechees also have some native American or indigenous American ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gullah/Geechee Nation&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Gullah people speak an English-based creole language containing many African loanwords and influenced by African languages in grammar and sentence structure. Sometimes referred to as &quot;Sea Island Creole&quot; by linguists and scholars, the Gullah language is sometimes considered as being similar to Bahamian Creole, Barbadian Creole, Guyanese Creole, Belizean Creole, Jamaican Patois, Trinidadian Creole, Tobagonian Creole, and the Sierra Leone Krio language of West Africa. Gullah crafts, farming and fishing traditions, folk beliefs, music, rice-based cuisine and story-telling traditions all exhibit strong influences from Central and West African cultures.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;Gullah&quot; can be traced to the Kikongo language, spoken around the Congo River&#x27;s mouth, from which the Gullah language dialects spoken by black Americans today come. Some scholars suggest that it may be cognate with the name &quot;Angola&quot;, where the ancestors of many of the Gullah people originated. Shipping records from the Port of Charleston revealed that Angolans accounted for 39% of all enslaved Africans shipped to the port. The story of Gullah Jack (an African slave trafficked from Angola to the United States) further supports the theory that the word &quot;Gullah&quot; originated in Angola.

Some scholars also have suggested that it may come from the name of the Gola, an ethnic group living in the border area between present-day Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa, another area of enslaved ancestors of the Gullah people. British planters in the Caribbean and the Southern colonies of North America referred to this area as the &quot;Grain Coast&quot; or &quot;Rice Coast&quot;; many of the tribes are of Mandé or Manding origins. The name &quot;Geechee&quot;, another common name for the Gullah people, may derive from the name of the Kissi people, an ethnic group living in the border area between Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia.

Another possible linguistic source for &quot;Gullah&quot; are the Dyula ethnic group of West Africa, from whom the American Gullah might be partially descended. The Dyula civilization had a large territory that stretched from Senegal through Mali to Burkina Faso and the rest of what was French West Africa. These were vast savanna lands with lower population densities. Slave raiding was easier and more common here than in forested areas with natural forms of physical defenses. The word &quot;Dyula&quot; is pronounced &quot;Gwullah&quot; among members of the Akan ethnic group in Ghana and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The primary land route through which captured Dyula people then came into contact with European slavers was the &quot;Grain Coast&quot; and &quot;Rice Coast&quot; (present-day Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegambia, and Guinea).

One scholar suggested that the Gullah-Geechee name could have also been adopted from the Ogeechee River. Sapelo Island, the site of the last Gullah community of Hog Hammock, was also a principal place of refuge for Guale people who fled slavery on the mainland.

==History==
===African roots===

According to Port of Charleston records, African slaves shipped to the port came from the following areas: Angola (39%), Senegambia (20%), the Windward Coast (17%), the Gold Coast (13%), Sierra Leone (6%), the Bight of Benin and Bight of Biafra (5% combined), Madagascar and Mozambique.

Particularly along the western coast, the local peoples had cultivated African rice, related to but distinct from Asian rice, for what is estimated to approach 3,000 years. It was originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper Niger River. Once Carolinian and Georgian planters in the American South discovered that African rice would grow in that region, they often sought enslaved Africans from rice-growing regions because they had the skills and knowledge needed to develop and build irrigation, dams and earthworks.

Two British trading companies operated the slave castle at Bunce Island (formerly called Bance Island), located in the Sierra Leone River. Their main contact in Charleston was American Founding Father Henry Laurens. His counterpart in Britain was the Scottish merchant and slave trader Richard Oswald. Many of the enslaved Africans taken in West Africa were processed through Bunce Island, a prime export site for slaves to South Carolina and Georgia. Slave castles in Ghana, by contrast, shipped many of the people they traded to ports and markets in the Caribbean islands.

After Freetown, Sierra Leone, was founded in the late 18th century by the British as a colony for poor black people from London and black Loyalists from Nova Scotia resettled after the American Revolutionary War. The British did not allow slaves to be taken from Sierra Leone, protecting the people from kidnappers. In 1808 both Great Britain and the United States prohibited the African slave trade. After that date, the British, whose navy patrolled to intercept slave ships off Africa, sometimes resettled Africans liberated from slave trader ships in Sierra Leone. Similarly, Americans sometimes settled freed slaves at Liberia, a similar colony established in the early 19th century by the American Colonization Society. As it was a place for freed slaves and free blacks from the United States, some free blacks emigrated there voluntarily, for the chance to create their own society.

===Origin of Gullah culture===
The Gullah people have been able to preserve much of their African cultural heritage because of climate, geography, cultural pride, and patterns of importation of enslaved Africans. The peoples who contributed to Gullah culture included the Bakongo, Mbundu, Vili, Yombe, Yaka, Pende, Mandinka, Kissi, Fulani, Mende, Wolof, Kpelle, Temne, Limba, Dyula, Susu, and the Vai.

By the middle of the 18th century, thousands of acres in the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry, and the Sea Islands were developed as African rice fields. African farmers from the &quot;Rice Coast&quot; brought the skills for cultivation and tidal irrigation that made rice farming one of the most successful industries in early America.

The subtropical climate encouraged the spread of malaria and yellow fever, which were both carried and transmitted by mosquitoes. These tropical diseases were endemic in Africa and might have been carried by enslaved Africans to the colonies. Mosquitoes in the swamps and inundated rice fields of the Lowcountry picked up and spread the diseases to European settlers, as well. Malaria and yellow fever soon became endemic in the region.

Because they had acquired some immunity in their homeland, Africans were more resistant to these tropical fevers than were the Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import enslaved Africans. By about 1708, South Carolina had a black majority. Coastal Georgia developed a black majority after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant. Others lived mostly in cities such as Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands.

The planters left their European or African &quot;rice drivers&quot;, or overseers, in charge of the rice plantations. These had hundreds of laborers, with African traditions reinforced by new imports from the same regions. Over time, the Gullah people developed a creole culture in which elements of African languages, cultures, and community life were preserved to a high degree. Their culture developed in a distinct way, different from that of the enslaved African Americans in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, where the enslaved lived in smaller groups, and had more sustained and frequent interactions with whites and British American culture.

In late 2024 underwater sonar was used to map 45 previously unknown irrigation devices used to control water flow for rice fields in conjunction with earthen dams and levees, developed by the Gullah Geechee over an area of 2,000 acres (800 hectares) of the northern end of Eagles Island, North Carolina, US. This provided evidence of the Gullah Geechee engineering and technological skills used for rice cultivation.

===Civil War period===
When the U.S. Civil War began, the Union rushed to blockade Confederate shipping. White planters on the Sea Islands, fearing an invasion by the US naval forces, abandoned their plantations and fled to the mainland. When Union forces arrived on the Sea Islands in 1861, they found the Gullah people eager for their freedom, and eager as well to defend it. Many Gullah served with distinction in the Union Army&#x27;s First South Carolina Volunteers. The Sea Islands were the first place in the South where slaves were freed. Long before the War ended, Unitarian missionaries from Pennsylvania came to start schools on the islands for the newly freed slaves. Penn Center, now a Gullah community organization on Saint Helena Island, South Carolina, was founded as the first school for freed slaves.

After the Civil War ended, the Gullahs&#x27; isolation from the outside world increased in some respects. The rice planters on the mainland gradually abandoned their plantations and moved away from the area because of labor issues and hurricane damage to crops. Free blacks were unwilling to work in the dangerous and disease-ridden rice fields. A series of hurricanes devastated the crops in the 1890s. Left alone in remote rural areas of the Lowcountry, the Gullah continued to practice their traditional culture with little influence from the outside world well into the 20th century.

===Since late 20th century===
In the 20th century, some plantations were redeveloped as resort or hunting destinations by wealthy whites. Gradually more visitors went to the islands to enjoy their beaches and mild climate. Since the late 20th century, the Gullah people—led by Penn Center and other determined community groups—have been fighting to keep control of their traditional lands. Since the 1960s, resort development on the Sea Islands greatly increased property values, threatening to push the Gullah off family lands which they have owned since emancipation. They have fought back against uncontrolled development on the islands through community action, the courts, and the political process.

The Gullah have also struggled to preserve their traditional culture in the face of much more contact with modern culture and media. In 1979, a translation of the New Testament into the Gullah language was begun. The American Bible Society published &quot;De Nyew Testament&quot; in 2005. In November 2011, &quot;Healin fa de Soul&quot;, a five-CD collection of readings from the Gullah Bible, was released. This collection includes &quot;Scipcha Wa De Bring Healing&quot; (&quot;Scripture That Heals&quot;) and the Gospel of John (&quot;De Good Nyews Bout Jedus Christ Wa John Write&quot;). This was the most extensive collection of Gullah recordings, surpassing those of Lorenzo Dow Turner. The recordings have helped people develop an interest in the culture, because they get to hear the language and learn how to pronounce some words.
The Gullah achieved another victory in 2006 when the U.S. Congress passed the &quot;Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Act&quot;; it provided US$10 million over 10 years for the preservation and interpretation of historic sites in the Low Country relating to Gullah culture. The Act provides for a Heritage Corridor to extend from southern North Carolina to northern Florida in a project administered by the US National Park Service with extensive consultation with the Gullah community.
The Gullah have also been in contact with West Africa. Gullah groups made three celebrated &quot;homecomings&quot; to Sierra Leone in 1989, 1997, and 2005. Sierra Leone is at the heart of the traditional rice-growing region of West Africa where many of the Gullahs&#x27; ancestors originated. Bunce Island, the British slave castle in Sierra Leone, sent many African captives to Charleston and Savannah during the mid- and late 18th century. These dramatic homecomings were the subject of three documentary films—&quot;Family Across the Sea&quot; (1990), &quot;The Language You Cry In&quot; (1998), and &quot;Priscilla&#x27;s Legacy&quot;.

==Customs and traditions==

===African influences===
*The Gullah word &quot;guba&quot; (or &quot;goober&quot;) for peanut derives from the Kikongo and Kimbundu word &quot;N&#x27;guba&quot;.
*The Gullah dishes red rice and okra soup are similar to West African jollof rice and okra soup. Jollof rice is a traditional style of rice preparation brought by the Wolof people of West Africa.
*The Gullah version of &quot;gumbo&quot; has its roots in African cooking. &quot;Gumbo&quot; is derived from a word in the Umbundu language of Angola, meaning okra, one of the dish&#x27;s main ingredients.
*Gullah rice farmers once made and used mortar and pestles and winnowing fanners similar in style to tools used by West African rice farmers.
*Gullah beliefs about &quot;hags&quot; and &quot;haunts&quot; are similar to African beliefs about malevolent ancestors, witches, and &quot;devils&quot; (forest spirits).
*Gullah &quot;root doctors&quot; protect their clients against dangerous spiritual forces by using ritual objects similar to those employed by African traditional healers.
*Gullah herbal medicines are similar to traditional African remedies.
*The Gullah &quot;seekin&quot; ritual is similar to coming of age ceremonies in West African secret societies, such as the Poro and Sande.
*The Gullah ring shout is similar to ecstatic religious rituals performed in West and Central Africa.
*Gullah stories about &quot;Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; are similar to West and Central African trickster tales about the figures of the clever and conniving rabbit, spider, and tortoise.
*Gullah spirituals, shouts, and other musical forms employ the &quot;call and response&quot; method commonly used in African music.
*Gullah &quot;sweetgrass baskets&quot; are coil straw baskets made by the descendants of enslaved peoples in the South Carolina Lowcountry. They are nearly identical to traditional coil baskets made by the Wolof people in Senegal.
*Gullah &quot;strip quilts&quot; mimic the design of cloth woven with the traditional strip loom used throughout West Africa. Kente cloth from the Ashanti and the Ewe peoples, as well as Akwete cloth from the Igbo people are woven on the strip loom.
* An African song, preserved by a Gullah family in coastal Georgia, was identified in the 1940s by linguist Lorenzo Turner and found to be a Mende song from Sierra Leone. It is probably the longest text in an African language to survive the transatlantic crossing of enslaved Africans to the present-day United States. Later, in the 1990s, researchers Joseph Opala, Cynthia Schmidt, and Taziff Koroma located a remote village in Sierra Leone where the song is still sung today, and determined it is a funeral hymn. This research and the resulting reunion between a Gullah family and a Mende family that have both retained versions of the song is recounted in the documentary &quot;The Language You Cry In&quot; (1998).
* Some words coming from other African languages such as Yoruba, Fon, Ewe, Twi, Ga, Mende, and Bini are still used by Gullah people.
*The Gullahs’ English-based creole language is strikingly similar to Sierra Leone Krio of West Africa and contains such identical expressions as &quot;bigyai&quot; (&quot;greedy&quot;), &quot;pantap&quot; (&quot;on top of&quot;), &quot;ohltu&quot; (&quot;both&quot;), &quot;tif&quot; (&quot;steal&quot;), &quot;yeys&quot; (&quot;ear&quot;), and &quot;swit&quot; (&quot;delicious&quot;).

===Cuisine===
The Gullah have preserved many of their west African food ways growing and eating crops such as Sea island red peas, Carolina Gold rice, Sea island Benne, Sea island Okra, sorghum, and watermelon all of which were brought with them from West Africa. Rice is a staple food in Gullah communities and continues to be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures. 

Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah food system: a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then hand wash the rice numerous times before it was ready for cooking. The Gullah people would add enough water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that one would have to stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people.

The first high-profile book on Gullah cooking was published in 2022 by Emily Meggett, an 89-year-old Gullah cook.

===Celebrating Gullah culture===
Over the years, the Gullah have attracted study by many historians, linguists, folklorists, and anthropologists interested in their rich cultural heritage. Many academic books on that subject have been published. The Gullah have also become a symbol of cultural pride for blacks throughout the United States and a subject of general interest in the media. Numerous newspaper and magazine articles, documentary films, and children&#x27;s books on Gullah culture, have been produced, in addition to popular novels set in the Gullah region. In 1991 Julie Dash wrote and directed &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot;, the first feature film about the Gullah, set at the turn of the 20th century on St. Helena Island. Born into a Gullah family, she was the first African-American woman director to produce a feature film.

Gullah people now organize cultural festivals every year in towns up and down the Lowcountry. Hilton Head Island, for instance, hosts a &quot;Gullah Celebration&quot; in February. It includes &quot;De Aarts ob We People&quot; show; the &quot;Ol’ Fashioned Gullah Breakfast&quot;; &quot;National Freedom Day,&quot; the &quot;Gullah Film Fest&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Gullah&quot; food and entertainment, a &quot;Celebration of Lowcountry Authors and Books,&quot; an &quot;Arts, Crafts &amp; Food Expo,&quot; and &quot;De Gullah Playhouse&quot;. Beaufort hosts the oldest and the largest celebration, &quot;The Original Gullah Festival&quot; in May. The nearby Penn Center on St. Helena Island holds &quot;Heritage Days&quot; in November. Other Gullah festivals are celebrated on James Island, South Carolina, and Sapelo Island, Georgia.

Gullah culture is also being celebrated elsewhere in the United States. The High Art Museum in Atlanta has presented exhibits about Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana conducted a research tour, cultural arts festival, and other related events to showcase the Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center Library maintains a bibliography of Gullah books and materials, as well. Metro State College in Denver, Colorado, hosted a conference on Gullah culture, called &quot;The Water Brought Us: Gullah History and Culture,&quot; which featured a panel of Gullah scholars and cultural activists. These events in Indiana and Colorado are typical of the attention Gullah culture regularly receives throughout the United States.

===Cultural survival===
Gullah culture has proven to be particularly resilient. Gullah traditions are strong in the rural areas of the Lowcountry mainland and on the Sea Islands, and among their people in urban areas such as Charleston and Savannah. Gullah people who have left the Lowcountry and moved far away have also preserved traditions; for instance, many Gullah in New York, who went North in the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century, have established their own neighborhood churches in Harlem, Brooklyn, and Queens. Typically they send their children back to rural communities in South Carolina and Georgia during the summer months to live with grandparents, uncles, and aunts. Gullah people living in New York frequently return to the Lowcountry to retire. Second- and third-generation Gullah in New York often maintain many of their traditional customs and many still speak the Gullah language.

The Gullah custom of painting porch ceilings haint blue to deter haints, or ghosts, survives in the American South. It has also been adopted by White Southerners.

==Representation in art, entertainment, and media==
&quot;Gullah Gullah Island&quot; is an American musical children&#x27;s television series that was produced by and aired on the Nick Jr. programming block on the Nickelodeon network from October 24, 1994, to April 7, 1998. The show was hosted by Ron Daise—now the former vice president for Creative Education at Brookgreen Gardens in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina—and his wife Natalie Daise, both of whom also served as cultural advisors, and were inspired by the Gullah culture of Ron Daise&#x27;s home of St. Helena Island, South Carolina, part of the Sea Islands.

<text>Kanchenjungha (&quot;Kanchonjônggha&quot;) is a 1962 Indian film directed by Satyajit Ray.

The film is about an upper class Bengali family on vacation in Darjeeling, a popular hill station and resort, near Kanchenjunga.

== Plot ==
A wealthy family from Calcutta is on the last day of their vacation in Darjeeling, a hill station at the foot of Mount Kanchenjungha, the second highest peak of the Himalayas. Until now, they have been unable to catch a glimpse of the peak of Kanchenjungha. The family members are dominated by the father, Indranath (Chhabi Biswas), an industrialist. He wants his daughter to marry a man of his choice and hopes that the man will propose if they are left together alone for some time.

Several long walks and long conversations form the main body of the film. The real-time drama unfolds the daughter&#x27;s feelings about her father&#x27;s idea, and the negative reactions to this by her mother and others. By accident, she meets an outsider, Ashoke, a young student who has refused a job offer from Indranath. Though nothing develops between them, his presence coupled with the setting of mountains and the failure of her sister&#x27;s marriage prompts her to reject the proposed suitor.

At the end of his walk, the industrialist arrives at a rendezvous point, expecting to meet his family and the successful suitor. None of them is present to greet him. As the mist clears, the peak of Kanchenjungha is revealed in its full glory. But Indranath is too pre-occupied to admire it.
==Cast==
*Chhabi Biswas: Indranath Roy
*Karuna Banerjee: Labanya, wife
*Anil Chatterjee: Anil, son
*Alokananda Roy: Monisha, unmarried daughter
*Anubha Gupta: Anima, elder daughter
*Arun Mukherjee: Ashoke, young man from Calcutta
*Subrata Sen: Sankar
*Sibani Singh: Tuklu
*Vidya Singh: Anil&#x27;s girlfriend
*Pahari Sanyal: Jagadish
*N. Viswanathan: Bannerjee

== Production ==

Kanchenjungha was Ray&#x27;s first original screenplay and for the first time, he was shooting in color. The film shows about 100 minutes (in real time) in the life of a group of rich Bengalis on vacation. Unlike the usual Ray films, it has a linear narrative with no central characters, and no straight narrative in the classical sense.

It is a very structured and composed film that uses color and nature to heighten the drama. Ray told his biographer Andrew Robinson: &quot;The idea was to have the film starting with sunlight. Then clouds coming, then mist rising, and then mist disappearing, the cloud disappearing, and then the sun shining on the snow-peaks. There is an independent progression to Nature itself, and the story reflects this.&quot;

As the weather becomes misty - the young daughter and the suitor part at that point, Indranath meets Ashoke, and the elder daughter, Anima and her husband have a bitter moment between them. And then when the sun appears again - Anima&#x27;s daughter comes back to her parents and they accept her, the misunderstanding is cleared up, and the younger daughter and Ashoke develop a tentative relationship with a hint of future prospects.

== Analysis ==

=== Narrative structure ===

The structure of the film contrasts a primary plot with a secondary plot. The secondary plot involves two characters, largely static, and is played out in scenes involving only them. The primary plot pulls in most of the characters, in various groups coming together and breaking apart, across many different locations, as they all walk the circular path rising and falling over the mountainside.

The film happens in linear realtime, i.e. the runtime of the film covers events happening over approximately the same period. However frequent inter-cutting between the different groups fractures this linearity, as does the thematically opposed trajectories of the two plots, one proceeding from family to the individual while the other proceeds from the individual to the family.

However there are elements cutting across this chopped up structure. The youngest child of the family, riding in circles and singing a counting rhyme, keeps moving across the background of the scenes like a metronome. The shifting states of weather are a constant backdrop, anchoring everything in time. In the end the climax of all trajectories is capped by the snowy peaks of Kanchenjungha finally appearing out of the clouds, suggesting an underlying unity of everybody&#x27;s private struggles and their resolutions.

=== Characters ===

The characters and the Nature are interrelated in mood. In his later film Asani Sanket (Distant Thunder, 1973), Ray attempted quite the opposite. While the Nature is shown in its full glory and lushness, in contrast, the characters starve and do inhuman things.

As the characters do not change their clothes during the film (it being depiction of a real time event that happens in 100 odd minutes), the colors of clothes too add a dimension to the characters.

About Kanchenjungha, Ray told in an interview to Cineaste magazine, &quot;(It was) a very personal film. It was a good ten to fifteen years ahead of its time... Kanchenjungha told the story of several groups of characters and it went back and forth. ... It&#x27;s a very musical form, but it wasn&#x27;t liked. The reaction was stupid. Even the reviews were not interesting. But, looking back now, I find that it is a very interesting film.&quot;

<text>The Sri Lanka hill myna or Ceylon myna (Gracula ptilogenys) is a myna, a member of the starling family. This bird is endemic to Sri Lanka.

This passerine is typically found in forest and cultivation. The Sri Lanka myna builds a nest in a hole. The normal clutch is two eggs.

These 25 cm long birds have green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. There are large white wing patches, which are obvious in flight. The strong legs are bright yellow, and there are yellow wattles on the nape.

The different shape and position of the wattles and the stouter orange-red bill distinguish this species from the southern hill myna, which also occurs in Sri Lankan forests. The sexes are similar in plumage, but can be distinguished by iris color, which is pale in females and dark in males. Juveniles have a duller bill and smaller wattles, and are less glossy overall.

Like most starlings, the Sri Lanka myna is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects.

==In culture==
In Sri Lanka, the Myna bird is known in many names including &quot;Sela lihiniya&quot;, &quot;Mal kawadiya&quot;, &quot;Kampatiya&quot; in the Sinhala language. The name &quot;Sela Lihiniya&quot; is often mentioned in poems and other similar literature and is quoted for its melodious calls. This bird appears in a 10 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp. It is also the media icon of Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.

<text>John Henry Mackay (February 6, 1864 – May 16, 1933) was a Scottish-German egoist anarchist, thinker and writer. Born in Scotland and raised in Germany, Mackay was the author of &quot;Die Anarchisten&quot; (The Anarchists, 1891) and &quot;Der Freiheitsucher&quot; (The Searcher for Freedom, 1921).

Later in life, under the pseudonym Sagitta, he became an advocate for homosexual love between men and boys.

==Biography==
Mackay was born in Greenock, Scotland, on 6 February 1864. His mother came from a prosperous Hamburg family. His father was a Scottish marine insurance broker who died when Mackay was less than two years old. Mother and son then returned to Germany, where Mackay grew up.

He gained fame as a poet and author of naturalist novels. Some of his earliest poems attracted the attention of censors for their socialist sentiments, so Mackay republished them in Switzerland.

During a one-year stay in London (1887/88), he discovered the works of Max Stirner, whose book (&quot;The Ego and its Own&quot;) had nearly been forgotten in the second half of the 19th century. Stirner soon became his life&#x27;s topic. When an English translation of Stirner&#x27;s work was published in 1907, James Huneker wrote: &quot;To Mackay&#x27;s labors we owe all we know of a man who was as absolutely swallowed up by the years as if he had never existed.&quot;

The publication of the novel in Zurich in 1891 and in an English translation as &quot;The Anarchists: A Picture of Civilization at the Close of the Nineteenth Century&quot; the same year brought him far wider fame. The novel &quot;tirelessly championed&quot; the ideas of Stirner. He further lifted this 19th century philosopher from obscurity by writing the biography &quot;Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk&quot; (1898).

His novel (&quot;The Swimmer: The Story of a Passion&quot;) (1901), was one of the first sports novels, set in the world of competitive swimming and diving. Mackay described himself as &quot;always a passionate swimmer&quot; thought not a sport for him. He dedicated the book to &quot;my beloved art of swimming&quot;. The novel describes &quot;the rise and fall of an individual who prides himself on his individuality, but who finally comes to see that individuality by itself is not enough to sustain him&quot;.

After his mother&#x27;s death, he embarked on a literary project under the pseudonym Sagitta, to argue on behalf on homosexual relations between men and boys. He himself was attracted to boys aged 14 to 17. He planned to publish several volumes under the pseudonym &quot;Sagitta&quot;, but government authorities had the early ones banned for indecency in 1909. His publisher never revealed Mackay&#x27;s identity, though he was subject to fines, which Mackay paid on his behalf. Mackay published these works and additional material as &quot;Die Bücher der namenlosen Liebe von Sagitta&quot; (Sagitta&#x27;s Books of the Love without a Name). Included was &quot;Fenny Skaller&quot;, an autobiographical account of his own love interests. The series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913. One of his themes was the variability of sexual identity and expression. He attacked the medical establishment&#x27;s attempt to create categories and labels: &quot;For physicians, people are only valuable when they are sick.&quot;

He published the novel &quot;Der Freiheitsucher&quot; (&quot;The Freedom Seeker&quot;), a sequel to &quot;Die Anarchisten&quot;, in 1920. It failed to achieve the earlier volume&#x27;s success and Mackay was ruined financially by the inflation of the early Weimar years.

He nevertheless published his seventh Sagitta novel in 1926, (&quot;The Hustler&quot;). Providing a blurb for the 1985 English translation, Christopher Isherwood wrote that the novel &quot;gives a picture of the Berlin sexual underworld early in this century which I know, from my own experience, to be authentic.&quot; It depicted the social world of &quot;young men who prostitute themselves in Berlin, without much concern for their own sexual identity or that of their clients&quot;. In the course of a year centered on his 16th birthday, Gunther learns to survive in Berlin, selling himself and socializing with his peers, living the narrowest of lives, without plans beyond surviving another day. His counterpart Hermann, six or seven years older, &quot;tedious and ineffectual&quot; in one critic&#x27;s view, arrives to take a job in a publishing house and is destroyed by his infatuation with Gunther. In the closing pages, a new character argues for the decriminalization of same-sex relations and tells Hermann his love for Gunther was certain to end as Gunther became a man, asserting Mackay&#x27;s particular sexual interest and undercutting Hermann&#x27;s sentimental vision.

He published his last novel (&quot;The Innocent: The Story of a Transformation&quot;) in 1931; it was the first work published under his own name to include homosexual characters.

A volume of his selected works was published in a single volume in 1928.

Mackay died in Stahnsdorf, a town not far from Berlin, on 16 May 1933. His will asked for his manuscripts and letters to be destroyed, and for one of his creditors to receive his unsold books. His will specified that any new printings of the Sagitta novels should be published under his own name.

A brief notice of his death in the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted he became famous in the 1890s for &quot;Anarchists&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot; (his poetry collection) and said that in Germany he was called &quot;an anarchistic lyricist&quot;.

Mackay lived in Berlin from 1896 onwards and became a friend of Benedict Friedlaender, a scientist and the co-founder of the &quot;Gemeinschaft der Eigenen&quot;.

Mackay was published in the United States in his friend Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Liberty&quot;.

=== Adaptations ===
Max Reger set a Mackay poem as &quot;Morgen&quot; (Op. 66 No. 10).

Richard Strauss set two of Mackay&#x27;s poems to music in his &quot;Vier Lieder&quot; for high voice and piano (Op. 27), a wedding gift to his wife in 1894, &quot;Morgen!&quot; and &quot;Heimliche Aufforderung&quot;. Other settings of Mackay&#x27;s poems by Strauss include &quot;Verführung&quot; for voice and orchestra in 1896 (Op. 33 No. 1) and &quot;In der Campagna&quot; for voice and piano in 1899 (Op. 41 No. 2).

Arnold Schoenberg set Mackay&#x27;s poem &quot;Am Wegrand&quot; to music, his Op. 6 No. 6.

<text>Before European colonization, the Turks and Caicos Islands were inhabited by Taíno and Lucayan peoples. 
The first recorded European sighting of the islands now known as the Turks and Caicos occurred in 1512. In the subsequent centuries, the islands were claimed by several European powers, with the British Empire eventually gaining control. For many years the islands were governed indirectly through Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. When the Bahamas gained independence in 1973, the islands received their own governor, and have remained a separate autonomous British Overseas Territory since. In August 2009, the United Kingdom suspended the Turks and Caicos Islands&#x27; self-government following allegations of ministerial corruption. Home rule was restored in the islands after the November 2012 elections.

== Pre-colonial history ==

Long before Christopher Columbus first set foot on the capital island of Grand Turk during his discovery voyage of the new world in 1492, the islands of the Turks and Caicos were inhabited by Taino and Lucayan peoples. These original settlers left a rich heritage of seafaring, salt raking and farming, which still lingers on today. Words such as &quot;canoe&quot;, Caribbean and &quot;caicos&quot; are derived from the Arawak language. Even the name of the country comes from these earliest inhabitants. Turks is a reference to the indigenous Turk&#x27;s head cactus and Caicos is from the Lucayan term &quot;caya hico&quot; meaning string of islands, words which entered the natives&#x27; language through an early colonist, Bernard Caicos.

For almost 700 years, the Taino and Lucayan were the sole residents of the islands, settling mainly in Middle Caicos and Grand Turk. They lived peacefully and were skilled in farming, fishing and gardening. They cultivated almost 50 types of plants, some of which can still be found on undeveloped sections of the islands.

Another peculiarity that has been passed down through the generations is a love of shellfish, particularly conch – which is actually available in abundance to this day, thanks to the work of the Caicos Conch farm, the only commercial conch farm in the world. It closed after damages caused by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in 2017.

==Colonial history prior to settlement==

Shortly after Columbus arrived in 1492, the Lucayan civilization disappeared and the islands remained sparsely populated for about 30 years.

The island &quot;Caico[s]&quot; received its name from the Lucayan &quot;caya hico&quot;, meaning &#x27;string of islands&#x27;. The Turks Islands were named after the Turk&#x27;s cap cactus, &quot;Melocactus intortus&quot;, whose red cephalium resembles the fez hat worn by Turkish men in the late Ottoman Empire.

During the second half of the XVI century the salt making industry was born. Bermudians came to Turks and Caicos to rake the salt and take it back to Bermuda. Salt was a precious commodity back then as it was used for preserving food. The shallow waters surrounding the islands were ideal for salt raking but treacherous for nautical navigation and more than 1000 ships were wrecked during the journey to and from.

The first recorded European sighting of the islands now known as the Turks and Caicos occurred in 1512. 
During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, the islands passed from Spanish, to French, to English (subsequently British) control, but none of the three powers ever established any settlements. In 1709, an early British colonist, Bernard Caicos, settled on the island.

From about 1690 to 1720, pirates hid in the cays of the Turks and Caicos Islands, attacking Spanish treasure galleons en route to Spain from Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Spanish possessions in Central America and Peru. The islands were not fully colonised until 1681, when salt collectors from Bermuda built the first permanent settlement on Grand Turk Island.

The salt collectors were drawn by the shallow waters around the islands that made salt mining a much easier process than in Bermuda. They occupied the Turks only seasonally, for six months a year, however, returning to Bermuda when it was no longer viable to rake salt. Their colonization established the British dominance of the archipelago that has lasted into the present day. Huge numbers of trees were felled by the Bermudians to discourage rainfall that would adversely affect the salt mining operation. This deforestation has yet to be repaired. Most of the salt mined in the Turks and Caicos Islands was sold through Bermudian merchant houses on the American seaboard, including in Newfoundland where it was used for preserving cod.

The agricultural industry sprung up in the islands in the late 1780s after 40 Loyalists arrived after the end of the American Revolution, primarily from Georgia and South Carolina. Granted large tracts of land by the British government to make up for what they lost in the American colonies, the Loyalists imported well over a thousand slaves and planted vast fields of sisal, harvested for its stiff fibre used in making various products such as rope.

Though in the short term highly successful, the cotton industry quickly went into decline, with hurricanes and pests destroying many crops. Though a few of the former cotton magnates changed to salt mining, just about every one of the original Loyalists had left the islands by 1820, leaving their slaves to live a subsistence lifestyle through fishing and hunter-gathering.

==Bermudian century==

In 1706, the French and the Spanish briefly captured the Turks and Caicos Islands from the Bermudians. Four years later the British reclaimed the islands for Bermuda but in subsequent years the place became primarily a haven for pirates and British Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution. Ultimately, Britain retained the island country by the end of the century as part of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1766, after being controlled by the Spanish, French and British, Turks and Caicos became part of the Bahamas colony and was placed under the Bahamian government. Attempts to integrate the two distinct communities failed and in 1874 after &quot;the Great Bahamas Hurricane&quot; devastated much of the chain of islands, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands became dependencies to the British Crown Colony of Jamaica.

Bermuda spent much of the 18th century in a protracted legal battle with the Bahamas (which had itself been colonised by Bermudian Puritans in 1647) over the Turks Islands. Under British law, no colony could hold colonies of its own. The Turks Islands were not recognised by Britain either as a colony in its own right, or as a part of Bermuda. They were held to be, like rivers in Britain, for the common use. As a result, there was a great deal of political turmoil surrounding the ownership of the Turks (and Caicos).

Spanish and French forces seized the Turks in 1706, but Bermudian forces expelled them four years later in what was probably Bermuda&#x27;s only independent military operation. The Bermudian privateer, the &quot;Rose&quot;, under the command of Captain Lewis Middleton, attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the &quot;Rose&quot; then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.

A virtual state-of-war existed between Bermuda and the Bahamas through much of the 18th century. When the Bermudian sloop &quot;Seaflower&quot; was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of Bermuda Governor Bennett was to issue letters-of-marque to Bermudians vessels. The legal struggle with the Bahamas began in 1766, when the King&#x27;s representative in the Bahamas, Andrew Symmer, on his own authority, wrote a constitution which legislated for and taxed the Bermudians on the Turks. The Secretary of State, Lord Hillsborough, for the Crown, issued orders that the Bermudian activities on the Turks should not be obstructed or restrained in any way. As a result of this order, Symmer&#x27;s constitution was dissolved. The Bermudians on the Turks appointed commissioners to govern themselves, with the assent of the King&#x27;s local agent. They drew up regulations for good government, but the Bahamian governor Shirley drew up his own regulations for the Turks and ordered that no one might work at salt raking who had not signed assent to his regulations.

Following this, a raker was arrested and the salt pans were seized and divided by force. The Bahamas government attempted to appoint judicial authorities for the Turks in 1768, but these were refused by the Bermudians. In 1773 the Bahamian government passed an act attempting to tax the salt produced in the Turks, but the Bermudians refused to pay it. In 1774, the Bahamians passed another, similar act, and this they submitted for the Crown&#x27;s assent. The Crown passed this act on to the Bermudian government which objected to it, and which rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. The Crown, as a consequence, refused assent of the Act as applied to include the Turks, and, in the form in which it finally passed, the Bahamas, but not the Turks, were included.

The Bermudians on the Turks continued to be governed under their own regulations, with the assent of the royal agent, until 1780, when a more formal version of those regulations was submitted for the assent of the Crown, which was given. Those regulations, issued as a royal order, stated that all British subjects had the right (&quot;free liberty&quot;) to rake and gather salt on the Turks, providing that they conformed to the regulations, which expressly rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. Despite this refutation by a higher authority of their right to impinge upon Bermudian activities on the Turks, the Bahamian government continued to harass the Bermudians (unsurprisingly, given the lucrativeness of the Turks salt trade).

Although the salt industry on the Turks had largely been a Bermudian preserve, it had been seen throughout the 17th century as the right of all British subjects to rake there, and small numbers of Bahamians had been involved. In 1783, the French landed a force on Grand Turk which a British force of 100 men, under then-Captain Horatio Nelson, was unable to dislodge.

Following this, the Bahamians were slow to return to the Turks, while the Bermudians quickly resumed salt production, sending sixty to seventy-five ships to the Turks each year, during the six months that salt could be raked. Nearly a thousand Bermudians spent part of the year on the Turks engaged in salt production, and the industry became more productive.

The Bahamas, meanwhile, was incurring considerable expense in absorbing loyalist refugees from the now-independent American colonies, and returned to the idea of taxing Turks salt for the needed funds. The Bahamian government ordered that all ships bound for the Turk Islands obtain a license at Nassau first. The Bermudians refused to do this. Following this, Bahamian authorities seized the Bermuda sloops &quot;Friendship&quot; and &quot;Fanny&quot; in 1786. Shortly after, three Bermudian vessels were seized at Grand Caicos, with $35,000 worth of goods salvaged from a French ship. French privateers were becoming a menace to Bermudian operations in the area, at the time, but the Bahamians were their primary concern.

The Bahamian government re-introduced a tax on salt from the Turks, annexed them to the Bahamas, and created a seat in the Bahamian parliament to represent them. The Bermudians refused these efforts also, but the continual pressure from the Bahamians had a degrative effect on the salt industry. In 1806, the Bermudian customs authorities went some way toward acknowledging the Bahamian annexation when it ceased to allow free exchange between the Turks and Bermuda (this affected many enslaved Bermudians, who, like the free ones, had occupied the Turks only seasonally, returning to their homes in Bermuda after the year&#x27;s raking had finished).

That same year, French privateers attacked the Turks, burning ships and absconding with a large sloop. The Bahamians refused to help, and the Admiralty in Jamaica claimed the Turks were beyond his jurisdiction. Two hurricanes, the first in August, 1813, the second in October, 1815, destroyed more than two-hundred buildings, significand salt stores, and sank many vessels. By 1815, the United States, the primary client for Turks salt, had been at war with Britain (and hence Bermuda) for three years, and had established other sources of salt.

With the destruction wrought by the storm, and the loss of market, many Bermudians abandoned the Turks, and those remaining were so distraught that they welcomed the visit of the Bahamian governor in 1819. The British government eventually assigned political control to the Bahamas, which the Turks and Caicos remained a part of until the 1840s.

One Bermudian salt raker, Mary Prince, however, was to leave a scathing record of Bermuda&#x27;s activities there in &quot;The History of Mary Prince&quot;, a book which helped to propel the abolitionist cause to the 1834 emancipation of slaves throughout the Empire.

==Bahamian and Jamaican jurisdictions==

The islands remained part of the Bahamas until 1848, when the inhabitants successfully petitioned to be made a separate colony governed by a council president under the supervision of the governor of Jamaica. This arrangement proved to be a financial burden.

In 1873, the islands were annexed to Jamaica with a commissioner and a Legislative Board; in 1894, the chief colonial official was restyled commissioner. In 1917, Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden suggested that the Turks and Caicos join Canada, but this suggestion was rejected by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The islands remained a dependency of Jamaica.

The islands remained a dependency of Jamaica until 1959, when they received their own administration under an administrator, although the governor of Jamaica remained the governor of the islands. When Jamaica was granted independence from Britain in August 1962, the Turks and Caicos Islands became a crown colony. From 1965 the governor of The Bahamas was also governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands and oversaw affairs for the islands.
From 1950 to 1981, the United States had a missile tracking station on Grand Turk. In the early days of the American space program, NASA used it. After his three earth orbits in 1962, American astronaut John Glenn successfully landed in the nearby ocean and was brought back ashore to Grand Turk island.

The salt industry, along with small sponge and hemp exports, sustained the Turks and Caicos Islands (only barely, however; there was little population growth and the economy stagnated) until in the 1960s American investors arrived on the islands and funded the construction of an airstrip on Provo Island and built the archipelago&#x27;s first hotel, &quot;The Third Turtle&quot;. A small trickle of tourists began to arrive, supplementing the salt economy. Club Med set up a resort at Grace Bay soon after. In the 1980s, Club Med funded an upgrading of the airstrip to allow for larger aircraft, and since then, tourism has been gradually on the increase. It is common for foreign couples to be married in the Turks and Caicos Islands today.

==Autonomy==

When the Bahamas gained independence in 1973, the Turks and Caicos received their own governor (the last administrator was restyled). In 1974, Canadian New Democratic Party MP Max Saltsman tried to use his Private Member&#x27;s Bill for legislation to annex the islands to Canada, but it did not pass in the House of Commons of Canada.

The islands adopted their first constitution on 30 August 1976, which is Constitution Day, the national holiday. Since then, the islands have had their own government headed by a chief minister (now premier). The winning party of Turks and Caicos&#x27; first general election in 1976, the People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (PDM) under &quot;Jags&quot; McCartney, sought to establish a framework and accompanying infrastructure in the pursuit of an eventual policy of full independence for the islands. However, with the early death of McCartney, confidence in the country&#x27;s leadership waned.

In 1980, the ruling pro-independence party, the People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (PDM), agreed with the British government that independence would be granted in 1982 if the PDM was reelected in the elections of that year. That election was effectively a referendum on the independence issue. The PDM lost the elections to the Progressive National Party (PNP), which supported continued British rule. The PNP&#x27;s leader, Norman Saunders, became chief minister, and won again the 1984 elections. With these developments, the independence issue largely faded from the political scene. However, in 1985 Saunders and two associates were convicted in the USA on drug charges.

The PNP emerged victorious from the following by-elections, but on 24 July 1986, the governor dissolved the government and replaced it with an advisory council after a report on allegations of arson and fraud found that the chief minister post-Saunders, Nathaniel Francis, along with four other PNP officials were unfit to rule.

The constitution was suspended in 1986, but restored and revised 5 March 1988. In the interim two Advisory Councils took over with members from the Progressive National Party (PNP), People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (PDM) and National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which was a splinter group from the PNP:

Under the careful guidance of the governor and the advisory council, a new constitution of the Turks and Caicos Islands was created and elections held in 1988, with the PNP winning by a landslide, and Washington Misick becoming the new chief minister.

Elections in the Turks and Caicos Islands were held on 24 April 2003 and again on 9 February 2007 with the PNP, led by Michael Misick, winning both. The Progressive National Party, led by Michael Misick, held thirteen seats, and the People&#x27;s Democratic Movement, led by Floyd Seymour, held two seats.

A new constitution came into force on 9 August 2006, but was in parts suspended and amended in 2009. 
Under the 2006 constitution, the head of government was the premier, filled by the leader of the elected party. The cabinet consisted of three &quot;ex officio&quot; members and five appointed by the governor from among the members of the House of Assembly. The unicameral House of Assembly consisted of 21 seats, of which 15 were popularly elected; members serve four-year terms.

However, in the mid-2000s, the issue of independence for the islands was again raised. In April 2006, PNP Premier Michael Misick reaffirmed that his party saw independence from Britain as the &quot;ultimate goal&quot; for the islands, but not at the present time.
In 2008, opponents of Misick accused him of moving toward independence for the islands to dodge a commission of inquiry, which examined reports of corruption by the Misick Administration.

In 2008, after members of the British parliament conducting a routine review the administration received several reports of high-level official corruption in the Turks and Caicos, Governor Richard Tauwhare announced the appointment of a Commission of Enquiry into corruption. The same year, Premier Misick himself became the focus of the corruption investigation. He resigned under fire in March 2009. As a result, Governor Gordon Wetherell suspended the local government and the British took over direct rule which lasted from August 2009 until the general elections of November 2012 under a new (15 October 2012) constitution.

===Corruption scandal and suspension of self-government===

In 2008, after members of the British parliament conducting a routine review of the administration received several reports of high-level official corruption in the Turks and Caicos, then-Governor Richard Tauwhare announced the appointment of a Commission of Enquiry into corruption. The same year, Premier Michael Misick himself became the focus of a criminal investigation after a woman identified by news outlets as an American citizen residing in Puerto Rico accused him of sexually assaulting her, although he strongly denies the charge.

On Monday, 16 March 2009, the UK threatened to suspend self-government in the islands and transfer power to the new governor, Gordon Wetherell, over systemic corruption.

On 18 March 2009, on the advice of her UK ministers, Queen Elizabeth II issued an Order in Council giving the Governor the power to suspend those parts of the 2006 Constitution that deal with ministerial government and the House of Assembly, and to exercise the powers of government himself. The order, which would also establish an Advisory Council and Consultative Forum in place of the House of Assembly, would come into force on a date to be announced by the governor, and remain in force for two years unless extended or revoked.

On 23 March 2009, after the enquiry found evidence of &quot;high probability of systemic corruption or other serious dishonesty&quot;, Misick resigned as Premier to make way for a new, unified government. Politicians were accused of selling crown land for personal gain and misusing public funds. The following day, Galmo Williams was sworn in as his replacement. Misick denied all charges, and referred to the British government&#x27;s debate on whether to remove the territory&#x27;s sovereignty as &quot;tantamount to being re-colonised. It is a backwards step completely contrary to the whole movement of history.&quot;

On 14 August 2009 after Misick&#x27;s last appeals failed, the Governor, on the instructions of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, imposed direct rule on the Turks and Caicos Islands by authority of the 18 March 2009 Order in Council issued by the Queen. The islands&#x27; administration was suspended for up to two years, with possible extensions, and power was transferred to the Governor, with the United Kingdom also stationing a supply vessel in between Turks and Caicos. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Chris Bryant said of the decision to impose rule, &quot;This is a serious constitutional step which the UK Government has not taken lightly but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management.&quot;

The move was met with vehement opposition by the former Turks and Caicos government, with Misick&#x27;s successor Williams calling it a &quot;coup&quot;, and stating that, &quot;Our country is being invaded and re-colonised by the United Kingdom, dismantling a duly elected government and legislature and replacing it with a one-man dictatorship, akin to that of the old Red China, all in the name of good governance.&quot; Despite this, the civilian populace was reported to be largely welcoming of the enforced rule. The British government stated that they intended to keep true to their word that the country would regain home rule in two years or less, and Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant said that elections would be held in 2011, &quot;or sooner&quot;. Governor Wetherell stated that he would aim to &quot;make a clean break from the mistakes of the past&quot; and create &quot;a durable path towards good governance, sound financial management and sustainable development&quot;. Wetherell added: &quot;In the meantime we must all learn to foster a quality of public spirit, listen to all those who have the long-term interests of these islands at heart, and safeguard the fundamental assets of the Territory for future generations... Our guiding principles will be those of transparency, accountability and responsibility. I believe that most people in the Turks and Caicos will welcome these changes.&quot;

=== Restoration of autonomy ===

On 12 June 2012 British Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that fresh elections would be held in November 2012, stating that there had been &quot;significant progress with an ambitious reform programme&quot; and that there had been &quot;sufficient progress, on the milestones and on putting in place robust financial controls&quot; A new constitution was approved on 15 October 2012. The terms of the election are specified in the constitution.
Under the new Constitution, legislative power is held by a unicameral House of Assembly, consisting of 19 seats, 15 elected and 4 appointed by the governor; of elected members, five are elected at large and 10 from single member districts for four-year terms.

After the 2012 elections, Rufus Ewing of the Progressive National Party won a narrow majority of seats and was appointed premier. Sharlene Cartwright-Robinson of the People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (PDM) becoming the leader of the opposition.

In the 2016 elections the People&#x27;s Democratic Movement prevailed and Sharlene Cartwright-Robinson became Premier.

<text>Nekor (Berber language: N&#x27;kor; ) is a historic site in the Rif region of Morocco near modern-day Bni Bouayach. It was founded by Idris ibn Salih, Emir of the medieval Kingdom of Nekor, between 749 and 761 AD. His son Sa&#x27;id I ibn Idris moved the capital to Nekor from Temsaman. At its height, it was described as the greatest center of Berber culture in the region of Rif.

In the winter of 859 to 860 AD Nekor, founded 200 years prior and defended by Sa&#x27;id II ibn Salih, was sacked by Viking raiders, apparently for attempting to interfere with their plunderings in the area, under Hastein and Björn Ironside, who sailed through the Straits of Gibraltar. After staying for eight days in Morocco, the Vikings went back to Spain and continued up the east coast. Of the 62 ships that went to the Iberian peninsula and then Morocco, only 20 returned.
 Many of the inhabitants of Nekor were taken as slaves and later sold in Ireland.

The city was destroyed by the Almoravid Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1080 during his conquest of the Rif.

The site has been partially submerged by the reservoir of the Abdelkrim Khattabi dam.

<text>Alphonsus Josephus de Ridder (7 May 1882 – 31 May 1960) was a Belgian writer and poet who wrote under the pseudonym Willem Elsschot (). One of the most prominent Flemish authors, his most famous work, &quot;Cheese&quot; (1933) is the most translated Flemish-language novel of all time.

== Early life and education ==
Elsschot was born Alphonsus Josephus de Ridder on 7 May 1882 in Antwerp, to a family of bakers. As a child he would often visit his uncle in rural Blauberg, near Herselt, where they would walk in the Helschot area, from which he would later derive his pen name.

After studying at a state school in Van Maerlantstraat, then the Royal Athenaeum of Antwerp, he attended the &quot;Institut Supérieur de Commerce de l&#x27;État&quot; , later known as the &quot;Rijkshandelshogeschool,&quot; where he would study economics and business, achieving a masters&#x27; degree in commercial sciences in 1904. It was during his studies there that he would develop a love for literature, while under the tutorship of Pol de Mont.

== Professional career ==
After finishing his studies, Elsschot worked in Paris for a South American businessman, then for various businesses in the Netherlands.

During the First World War, he served as the secretary of a national food relief committee in Antwerp, after which he moved into the world of advertising, setting up his own agency in 1911, which he would run until his death.

Elsschot did not enjoy the world of advertising. Before his death in 1960 he was quoted as saying: &quot;I am not only disgusted by advertising, but also by commercialism in general. And I wrote &quot;Lijmen&quot; because I had to get rid of it somehow. I had to advertise, because I could never live off my pen.&quot;

== Literary career ==
Elsschot began writing poetry in 1900, making his authorial debut as a poet (publishing in the magazine &quot;Alvoorder&quot;).

Yet it was as a writer of prose that he achieved much of his fame. Whilst living in Rotterdam he wrote &quot;Villa des Roses&quot; (1913), following the adventures of the guests of a Paris boardinghouse. While it was ignored by critics and readers alike upon its publication, his most famous works would come in the 1920s and 1930s: &quot;Lijmen&quot; (1924), &quot;Kaas&quot; (1933), &quot;Tsjip&quot; (1934) en &quot;Het Been&quot; (1938), novels with tragic and comic elements.

Central themes in his work are business and family life. His style is characterised by detailed descriptions of surroundings and a mild cynicism. In his first books he works with the same characters, giving the readers a familiarity and a sketch of life in Antwerp during the 1930s. His characters Boorman, an entrepreneur always looking for scams and opportunities, and Frans Laarmans, a clerk, evolve through these books.

== Personal life and death ==
He was married to Fine de Ridder, with whom he had a daughter, Ida. He also had a relationship with the poet Liane Bruilants.

In 1920, he became a knight of the Order of the Crown.

Elsschot died in Antwerp from a heart attack on 31 May 1960, at the age of 78. He was cremated and his ashes buried with the body of his wife in the Antwerpen Schoonselhof. He was posthumously awarded the State Prize for Literature, and in 1994 a statue of him was erected at Mechelseplein in Antwerp.

In 2005 he finished at No. 49 in the Flemish version of &quot;De Grootste Belg&quot; (&quot;The Greatest Belgian&quot;).

== Adaptations ==
=== Film adaptations ===
His novel &quot;Lijmen/Het Been&quot; was adapted into film by Robbe De Hert in 2001 as &quot;Lijmen/Het Been&quot;. &quot;Villa des Roses&quot; was adapted to film in 2002 by Frank Van Passel as &quot;Villa des Roses&quot;.

=== Comic book adaptation ===
In 2008 the novel &quot;Kaas&quot; (&quot;Cheese&quot;, 1933) and the novella &quot;Het dwaallicht&quot; (&quot;Will o&#x27;the Wisp&quot;, in &quot;Three Novels&quot;, 1946) were made into graphic novels by Dick Matena.

<text>Pinmonkey was an American country music band from Nashville, Tennessee. The band was formed in 2002 by Michael Reynolds (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), brothers Michael Jeffers (vocals, bass guitar) and Chad Jeffers (Dobro, lap steel guitar), and Rick Schell (drums, vocals). The band released two albums in 2002: &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; independently, and &quot;Pinmonkey&quot; via BNA Records. The latter produced two singles in &quot;Barbed Wire and Roses&quot; and a cover of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, both of which charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. Schell and Chad Jeffers both left in 2005, with Mike Crouch briefly replacing the former. After these membership changes, Pinmonkey released their third album &quot;Big Shiny Cars&quot; on Back Porch Records in 2006 before disbanding. Afterward, the Jeffers brothers became backing musicians for other artists, Schell joined Pure Prairie League, and Reynolds released a solo album. Pinmonkey received general critical favor for Reynolds&#x27;s singing voice, bluegrass and country rock influences, and the breadth of their cover song choices.

==Biography==
Pinmonkey was founded by Michael Reynolds (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Rick Schell (drums, vocals), Michael Jeffers (bass guitar, vocals), and Chad Jeffers (Dobro, lap steel guitar), the latter two of whom are brothers. The Jeffers brothers are natives of Kingsport, Tennessee, and had played in a band called the Habaneros, which was based out of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in the 1990s. Chad attended Belmont University; after graduating in 1994, he worked in the mail room of Starstruck Studios, a recording studio owned by Reba McEntire, in addition to serving as a backing musician for the Wilkinsons. Rick Schell, a native of Homer, New York, moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1993. He had been hired by Steve Earle as a backing musician, which led to him also playing for Joy Lynn White, Buddy Miller, Chris Knight, and Elizabeth Cook. Michael Reynolds grew up in Natural Bridge, Virginia. His father&#x27;s side of the family had several musicians who played bluegrass, and Reynolds himself sang in church as a child. He moved to Nashville after graduating high school, wanting to pursue a country music career. After working his first job at a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, he befriended Chad Jeffers in 1995. Reynolds went on to work various jobs in Nashville, including a record store called Cat&#x27;s, an attorney&#x27;s office, and the mail room of Capitol Records&#x27;s Nashville branch. Reynolds initially performed at various Nashville venues as a solo artist, as a means of promoting his songwriting, through the suggestion of another Cat&#x27;s employee. However, he felt uncomfortable performing by himself and thus had Chad perform with him. As they both wanted a bass player, Chad&#x27;s brother Michael joined the two. Rick Schell heard about Reynolds&#x27;s music through connections the two had at the attorney&#x27;s office, and the other three hired him to contribute on drums and sopranist harmony.

===Musical career===
Once all four musicians were in place, they began performing at nightclubs around Nashville. Through connections Schell had made at the attorney&#x27;s office, they hired Rick Alter as their manager. Originally, the four did not consider pursuing music full-time, and only performed when their schedules allowed it. However, due to positive fan reception, they chose to become a band. They were booked to play at a Nashville club called the Sutler, whose manager asked them to pick a name so the venue could advertise them. Reynolds chose &quot;Pinmonkey&quot; after a slang term for a pinsetter, a person who resets pins in the game of bowling. He came up with the name after hearing the word on an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Record executive Joe Galante heard the band perform at 12th and Porter, another nightclub in Nashville, and signed them to BNA Records in 2002. Just before their signing with BNA, Pinmonkey had recorded an album titled &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; on the independent Drifter&#x27;s Church label; Galante allowed the band to release the album, so they could have a product to promote before signing tour dates. Among said tour dates were eight stops on CMT&#x27;s &quot;Most Wanted Live&quot; tour. One of tracks on &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; was a cover of Gwil Owen&#x27;s &quot;Augusta&quot;. The independent album received a positive review in &quot;Billboard&quot;, which compared the band favorably to Pure Prairie League and Poco, while also praising Reynolds&#x27;s lead vocals and the musicianship.

In April 2002, BNA released the band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Barbed Wire and Roses&quot;. Co-written by Tia Sillers, Mark Selby, and Sean Locke, the song peaked at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. It served as the lead-off single to their self-titled album, released in late 2002. The album included covers of Sugar Ray&#x27;s &quot;Fly&quot;, Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, the Staple Singers&#x27;s &quot;Stay with Us&quot;, Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Falling Out of Love with Me&quot;, and a re-recording of the &quot;Augusta&quot; cover. The Parton cover also featured her on backing vocals. Reynolds wrote the tracks &quot;Jar of Clay&quot; and &quot;The Longest Road&quot;. Contributing musicians on the album included Ricky Skaggs, Al Perkins, and former Poco member Rusty Young, with Paul Worley and Mike Poole serving as producers. Jack Leaver of &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the cover songs in particular, as well as the use of Dobro and vocal harmony. AllMusic writer Erik Hage praised the &quot;tight musicianship&quot; and Reynolds&#x27;s lead vocals. By year&#x27;s end, Pinmonkey began to tour with Tim McGraw, Lee Ann Womack, and Brad Paisley. Additionally, the band was nominated by the Academy of Country Music for Top New Vocal Duo or Group. The only other single from the project was the cover of &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, which the band took to number 36 on the country chart in early 2003.

===200406: Membership changes, &quot;Big Shiny Cars&quot;, and disbanding===
A third single for BNA, a cover of Robbie Fulks&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Saturday Night&quot;, peaked at number 44 on Hot Country Songs in 2004. However, BNA dropped the band for undisclosed reasons weeks after the single&#x27;s release, and Schell quit soon after. In 2005, Schell released a solo album titled &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. Mike Crouch took over as drummer, while Chad Jeffers left to join Keith Urban&#x27;s road band. The three remaining members — Crouch, Reynolds, and Michael Jeffers — were signed to a recording contract with Back Porch Records, with the album &quot;Big Shiny Cars&quot; being released in 2006. This album produced one single in &quot;That Train Don&#x27;t Run&quot;. Matraca Berg co-wrote the song, and previously reached the Hot Country Songs charts in 1997 with her rendition. Reynolds wrote three tracks on the album, while other contributing writers included Kieran Kane, Joy Lynn White, and Billy Montana. The track &quot;Coldest Fire in Town&quot; included Rusty Young and Elizabeth Cook on backing vocals. Also included was a cover of Kelly Willis&#x27;s &quot;Wrapped&quot; (written by her then-husband, Bruce Robison); a year later, George Strait would have a number two hit on the country charts with his own version. Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time reviewed the album positively, praising the country rock sound and Reynolds&#x27;s singing voice. Giving the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, Jonathan Keefe of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;the album is too stylistically scattershot to stand as a coherent statement of artistic identity, but the elements of greatness—the technical skill, the recognition of good material, the charisma—are all present to varying degrees, making Pinmonkey one of the few honest-to-God bands on Music Row worth following.&quot;

After &quot;Big Shiny Cars&quot;, the members of Pinmonkey went on to other projects. Michael Jeffers became a touring musician for Joe Nichols, and Chad Jeffers joined Carrie Underwood&#x27;s touring band. Schell joined Pure Prairie League as a vocalist and drummer in 2007, but exited the band by 2012. In 2024, Michael Reynolds released a solo album titled &quot;Tarnished Nickel Sky&quot;. Writing for the blog Country Universe, Keefe called it &quot;an album of thoughtfully composed songs that are accessible without sounding beholden to country...trends.&quot;

==Musical style==
Pinmonkey&#x27;s sound combines a number of influences. Erik Hage of AllMusic wrote that Pinmonkey &quot;boasts a heady blend of country/Americana styles: traditional Southern gospel, Appalachian folk, Carter Family harmonizing, Muscle Shoals pop-soul, and even traces of &#x27;70s rock.&quot; Remz called Reynolds&#x27;s voice &quot;a bit smooth...and heartfelt at the same time&quot;. Leaver compared it favorably to that of Pure Prairie League vocalist Craig Fuller, a comparison also made by &quot;Billboard&quot; in their review of &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;, while Keefe found it similar to Jeff Hanna of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Of his singing voice, Reynolds said, &quot;everything I sing comes out bluegrass.&quot; In a concert review, Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time thought the band was unusual for having a Dobro player instead of a lead guitarist, while also considering Reynolds&#x27;s voice as strong in concert as it was on the albums. In a review of &quot;Big Shiny Cars&quot; for &quot;Country Weekly&quot;, Chris Neal described the band as having &quot;crisp harmonies&quot; and a &quot;bracing country rock sound&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, Greg Crawford thought the band&#x27;s sound mixed bluegrass with 1970s country rock, also highlighting Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;soulful&quot; voice and inclusion of Dobro in the arrangements. He thought the band&#x27;s sound would appeal to fans of the then-Dixie Chicks&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot;. Keefe also spoke favorably of the inclusion of Dobro in the band&#x27;s work.

Pinmonkey is also noted for their range of cover songs. According to Reynolds, Chad Jeffers suggested the &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; cover because his girlfriend at the time was a fan of Cyndi Lauper, and the band chose to listen to an acoustic recording made by Jeffers so that they could come up with a version not influenced by the original. Reynolds also said the band chose to cover Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Falling Out of Love with Me&quot; because he liked Parton&#x27;s songwriting and wanted to cover one of her songs. Although he liked the song, he did not consider it suitable for Pinmonkey until Chad started singing it during a conversation. However, the band had not considered including it on the album until artists and repertoire representatives at BNA Records asked them to include a ballad. While the band&#x27;s repertoire included relatively few original songs, Remz highlighted Reynolds&#x27;s composition &quot;Jar of Clay&quot;, noting that its lyrics about death showcased Pinmonkey&#x27;s bluegrass influences. Keefe thought Pinmonkey&#x27;s choices of cover songs were strong, particularly highlighting those of Robison and Berg, and that the original compositions &quot;Shady Grove&quot; and &quot;Mountain Song&quot; showed a newgrass influence, although he thought the range of cover song choices impacted the sequencing of &quot;Big Shiny Cars&quot;.

<doc id="642043" wikidata="Q1709337" url="?curid=642043" title="Emirate of Nekor">
<text>The Emirate of Nekor or Salihid Emirate () was an Arab emirate centered in the Rif area of present-day Morocco. Its capital was initially located at Temsaman, and then moved to Nekor. The dynasty was of Himyarite Arab descent from a certain companion of Uqba ibn Nafi (d. 683). The emirate was founded in 710 CE by Salih I ibn Mansur through a Caliphate grant. Under his guidance, the local Berber tribes adopted Islam, but later deposed him in favor of one az-Zaydi from the Nafza tribe. They subsequently changed their mind and reappointed Ibn Mansur. His dynasty, the Banū Sālih, thereafter ruled the region until 1019.

==History==
In 859, the kingdom became subject to a 62 ship-strong group of Vikings who defeated a Moorish force in Nekor that had attempted to interfere with their plundering in the area. After staying for eight days in Morocco, the Vikings returned to Spain and continued up the east coast.

The Nekor kingdom comprised part of the Moroccan Rif and included the tribes of Zouagha and Djeraoua of Ibn Abī l-ʻAys, about five days&#x27; journey from Nekor. This area was flanked by the territory of the Matmata, Kebdana, Mernissa, Ghassasa of Mount Herek, and Quluʻ Jarra belonging to the Banū Urtendi. On the west, it extended to the Banū Marwan of Ghomara and the Banū Humayd and bordered the Mestassa and Sanhaja. Behind these lay the Awraba, the band of Ferhun, the Banū Walīd, the Zenata, the Banū Irnian and the Banū Merasen of the band of Qāsim, Lord of Sa. In the north, it was bounded by the sea, some five miles from Nekor.

==Salihid rulers==
*Salih I ibn Mansur &quot;al-`Abd as-Salih&quot; (710–749)
*al-Mu&#x27;tasim ibn Salih (749–?), said to have been very pious
*Idris I ibn Salih (?–760), who founded Nekor
*Sa&#x27;id I ibn Idris (760–803), who moved the capital to Nekor. In his reign, Nekor was sacked by the Vikings, who took many prisoners, a few of whom were ransomed by the Umayyad ruler of Spain. Later, part of the Ghomara tribe revolted, led by a person called Segguen; their revolt was defeated.
*Salih II ibn Sa&#x27;id (803–864), whose brother led a revolt against him, but was defeated.
*Sa&#x27;id II ibn Salih (864–916); his older brother and uncle led an unsuccessful revolt against him, but he was ultimately defeated and killed by the Fatimid general Masala ibn Habus, who conquered the area for six months. However, his sons took refuge in Málaga with the Umayyad caliph of Córdoba, and returned once Masala had left the region and successfully expelled his garrison.
*Salih III ibn Sa&#x27;id (917–927); in gratitude, he acknowledged the Umayyads as the rightful caliphs, thus transferring his nominal allegiance.
*Abd al-Badi&#x27; ibn Salih &quot;el-Mu&#x27;ayyid&quot; (927–929); he was defeated and killed by another Fatimid general, Musa ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya, who destroyed Nekor again. However, the line was resumed (and the city rebuilt) by:
*Abu Ayyub Isma&#x27;il ibn &#x27;Abd al Malik ibn Abd ar-Rahman ibn Sa&#x27;id I ibn Salih (930?–935), who was defeated and killed by yet another Fatimid general, Sandal the mawla. However, when Sandal departed for Fez, installing a governor called Marmazu of the Kutama tribe, the inhabitants rebelled and installed yet another member of the line:
*Musa ibn Rumi ibn Abd as-Sami` ibn Salih ibn Idris I ibn Salih (936?–940), who defeated Marmazu and sent his head to the Umayyad caliph in Cordoba. However, he was soon exiled by his relative:
*Abd as-Sami&#x27; ibn Jurthum ibn Idris ibn Salih I ibn Mansur (940–947). His people rose up and killed him, and then sent for one of his relatives from Málaga:
*Jurthum ibn Ahmad ibn Ziyadat Allah ibn Sa&#x27;id I ibn Idris (947–970), who adopted the Maliki school of jurisprudence.

Thenceforth, the emirate remained in his line until the Azdaji emir Ya&#x27;la ibn Futuh conquered it in 1019 and expelled the family.

All dates are converted from Hijri, and may be up to a year out. This is largely based on Ibn Khaldun, whose account is itself based on al-Bakri.

<text>Hal Harry Magee Sparks III (born September 25, 1969) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, musician, political commentator, television and radio host and television personality. He made contributions to VH1, hosting E!&#x27;s &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, and played the roles of Michael Novotny on the American television series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, Donald Davenport in &quot;Lab Rats&quot; and the voice of Tak in &quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot; television series and video games.

==Early life==
Sparks was born on September 25, 1969, in Cincinnati, Ohio, but grew up in Peaks Mill, Kentucky, outside of Frankfort.

Sparks played Dungeons &amp; Dragons every Sunday with a group of friends at the local library in Frankfort. At the age of 11, he became a &quot;de facto dungeon master&quot; because none of his friends wanted to do the reading required to be a dungeon master.

When he was 14 years old, he moved to the Chicago area and enrolled at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, where he entered the theater department. Despite some initial opposition by his father, by 15 he began performing standup comedy and by 17 he won the title of &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Funniest Teenager&quot; from a stand-up contest sponsored the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

==Career==

=== Film ===
His first breakout role in a mainstream movie was in &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; (2000), as Zoltan, the bubble-wrapped leader of a clan of nerds obsessed with outer space. In a 2009 interview with We Are Movie Geeks, he confirmed he created the hand gesture in a &quot;Z&quot; formation. The &quot;Z&quot; hand gesture became the celebratory sign of choice among the members and fans of baseball&#x27;s Pittsburgh Pirates, of whom Sparks is a fan, starting in 2012. On July 25, 2012, he threw out the first pitch during a Pirates/Cubs series at PNC Park.

Sparks has appeared in other films, including &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, where he had a cameo as the elevator passenger who enjoys an awkward moment with Spider-Man. He also appeared in the opening scene of the 2009 Mike Judge film &quot;Extract&quot;, as one of the guitar salesmen scammed out of a guitar by the con-woman played by Mila Kunis.

In 2004, he starred as Deputy Dale in the independently produced &quot;Lightning Bug&quot;, which was written and directed by Robert Hall, who was an original bandmate in Hal&#x27;s hard rock band Zero 1.

=== Television ===

Sparks had his screen debut on the television movie &quot;Frog&quot;, starring Shelley Duvall, Elliott Gould, and Scott Grimes in 1987. Upon graduation, Sparks moved to Los Angeles and ten years later he was hired to host &quot;Talk Soup&quot; in 1999. He appeared as himself in the video &quot;Beat It,&quot; the Michael Jackson cover, by Fall Out Boy, and voiced a cameo on &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

Sparks had made appearances on various television programs from as early as 1994, when he played a long-haired skateboarder on the fourteenth episode of the first season of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. In 1995, he appeared in the &quot;Gentle Horse&quot; episode of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;. From 2000 through 2006, he appeared in &quot;Martial Law&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;One on One&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Las Vegas&quot;.

He went on to independently produce his first standup comedy DVD &quot;Escape from Halcatraz&quot; in 2008. Sparks is a regular guest on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Your $$$$$&quot;, &quot;The Joy Behar Show&quot; and &quot;The View&quot; when he is not hosting his own weekly progressive radio show. He has also participated in the Progressive Voices Cruise in 2009 and 2010.

Sparks had a leading role on the breakthrough Showtime television series, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, where he played Michael Novotny, a gay man living in Pittsburgh with his queer friends. The show is an American adaptation of the UK series of the same name written by Russell T Davies. In 2007, Sparks became the voice of the lead character in the animated series for children, &quot;Tak &amp; the Power of Juju&quot; for Nickelodeon (replacing Jason Marsden), which ran for twelve episodes between 2007 and 2008.

Sparks played Nelson Burkhard in the second season of &quot;Fuller House&quot; (replacing Jason Marsden). He portrayed Donald Davenport in &quot;Lab Rats&quot;. In early 2012, the &quot;Lab Rats&quot; premiere received the highest ratings for original series for the network. Sparks continued portraying Davenport in the spin-off &quot;Lab Rats: Elite Force&quot;. He provided the voice of the computer named &quot;Mr. Q&quot; on the U.S. television adaptation of &quot;20Q&quot;, which aired on the Game Show Network (GSN) in 2009.

==== Reality series and hosting ====
Sparks became the United States&#x27; youngest game show emcee in 1988 when he hosted the short-lived, syndicated game show &quot;Treasure Mall&quot;. He also participated on GSN&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Dodgeball&quot; as captain of the Chicago Hitmen team.

In 2006, Sparks competed for the charity Habitat for Humanity on the Fox celebrity competition &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;. He performed with such musical legends as Smokey Robinson, Gladys Knight, Wynonna Judd, Dennis DeYoung, Dee Snider and Sebastian Bach. He made it to the finale along with Lucy Lawless and Alfonso Ribeiro, and came in third in the series.

In 2007, Sparks was cast as the host for the WB reality series &quot;Survival of the Richest&quot;, where wealthy young adults were paired with those young adults with massive debts to complete challenges together and work as a team. Also in 2007, Sparks joined Roseanne to judge Nick at Night&#x27;s search for &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Mom&quot;.

Sparks was a contestant on the 2008 VH1 celeb-reality series &quot;Celebracadabra&quot;, where the celebrities vie to out-perform each other with magic they have learned from their experienced coaches. Other celebrity contestants competing included Ant, Lisa Ann Walter, Carnie Wilson, Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Reid, Kimberly Wyatt, and C. Thomas Howell. Howell was the winner, with Sparks taking second place.

In 2009, Sparks recorded his first Showtime comedy special &quot;Charmageddon&quot; in front of a standing-room-only crowd at the OC Pavilion in Santa Ana, California. The special aired in 2010, and was released on DVD.

In 2019, Sparks appeared in the premiere episode of &quot;Famously Afraid&quot; on the Travel Channel, a series in which celebrities tell of their personal unusual encounters, to describe his experience with alien abduction.

====VH1 appearances====
Sparks was one of five celebrities to appear in the first episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Paranormal Project&quot;. He has also been a regular commentator on several VH1 series, including the following:

== Other ventures ==

=== Radio ===
Sparks appears as a regular guest and fill-in host on the national &quot;Stephanie Miller Radio Show&quot;, providing three hours of commentary and humor on Wednesday mornings. The program is known as &quot;Hump Days with Hal&quot;, and is broadcast weekly from his U-stream channel. Sparks also appeared as guest host for Norman Goldman&#x27;s former Los Angeles-based show. Sparks broadcast hosting was also made available through Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Norm&quot; segments.

He continued this free &quot;behind the scenes&quot; Ustream show. In June 2010 he got his own radio program on WCPT (AM) as host of &quot;The Hal Sparks Radio Program (megaworldwide)&quot;, which broadcasts between 11am and 1pm CST each Saturday.

===Music===

In addition to acting, Sparks is also the lead singer and guitarist for a rock band, ZERO 1 (previously called The Hal Sparks Band). At the start, the band consisted of Sparks, his friend Rob Hall on bass and Sparks&#x27; cousin Miles Loretta on drums. Their self-titled debut album was released in December 2006 and produced by King&#x27;s X&#x27;s frontman DUg Pinnick. The album is available through iTunes and on Sparks&#x27; official website.

In 2007, both Sparks and Loretta from Zero 1 participated on Doug&#x27;s solo project &quot;Strum Sum Up&quot;.

The band now has a new lineup consisting of Sparks (lead vocals and guitar), Brian Crow (guitar and backup vocals), Bumper Renga (bass and backup vocals) and Lance Tamanaha (drums and backup vocals). They signed with the record label &quot;rocket science&quot; and have a new album on the way called &quot;The sacred nothing&quot;. Also expected to debut is the band&#x27;s first video for the single &quot;American Psycho,&quot; which was directed by Adrienne Wanyo and filmed on location at the Houdini Mansion.

Sparks was a contestant in the first season of &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;. He often joins the Los Angeles cover band Steel Panther to sing classic 1980s metal tunes, such as the Skid Row hit &quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot;.

===Stand-up===
In 2011 he joined Stephanie Miller and John Fugelsang for the successful &quot;Sexy Liberal Comedy Tour&quot; in various cities across the country. This tour topped more than a million dollars in ticket sales while raising money for local progressive causes. In 2012, Sparks and Fugelsang began the &quot;Politics, Sex and Religion Tour.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sparks is an activist who regularly participates in charitable events for organizations like AIDS Walk, Farm Sanctuary, the Lilli Claire Foundation, Imagine a Cure and the Marijuana Policy Project. He is straight edge and claims to never have drunk, smoked or used recreational drugs.

While at Los Angeles International Airport in 2010, Sparks and an airline passenger used CPR on an unconscious, elderly man who had collapsed in the airport terminal.

In May 2011, Sparks announced he would become a father during a Ustream show on Father&#x27;s Day. He debuted his son Camden Harrison Sparks at the 2011 AIDS Walk in Los Angeles.

Sparks has studied martial arts since the age of 8 years old and holds belts in Karate, Tae Kwon Do, and several forms of Kung Fu including Wushu.

In 2012, the Pittsburgh Pirates began using the iconic &quot;Zoltan&quot; hand gesture from &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; as a good luck symbol to turn around a 19-season losing streak. After a Twitter campaign to encourage the &quot;real Zoltan&quot; to appear at a game, Sparks flew to Pittsburgh on July 25, 2012, to throw out the honorary first pitch, and was on hand to see the Pirates win 3–2 over his hometown team, the Chicago Cubs. Despite picking up a cult following in Pittsburgh and helping the team contend in the playoff race well into September, the Pirates finished with a 79–83 record, extending their major North American professional sports record to 20 consecutive losing seasons.

Sparks is a Freemason, having been initiated on November 6, 2016, at Los Angeles Lodge No 42 F. &amp; A. M.

He lives in Chinatown, Los Angeles. He also does a political commentary talk show on the Chicago radio station WCPT 820 AM on Saturdays, which is uploaded on his YouTube channel. He also has a Twitch account.

<text>Nunawading railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Nunawading, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Nunawading station is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces, connected by two concourses. It opened on 4 June 1888, with the current station provided in 2010. 

Initially opened as Tunstall, the station was given its current name of Nunawading on 1 November 1945.

==History==
Nunawading station opened almost six years after the railway line from Camberwell was extended to Lilydale. Like the suburb itself, the name of the station is from an Indigenous word, &quot;numphawading&quot;, meaning ceremonial ground or battlefield. The settlement immediately adjacent to the station was originally named after Tunstall, England, famous for its potteries.

In 1956, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the former Springvale Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station.

In 1979, the station was one of three used as trial sites for new bike lockers under the Melbourne Bicycle Strategy, available either for occasional, monthly, or quarterly hire.

On 18 December 2009, the original ground-level station closed as part of a grade separation project to replace the Springvale Road level crossing. A new station, in a cutting west of Springvale Road, opened on 11 January 2010.

== Platforms and services ==
Nunawading is served by Lilydale and Belgrave line trains and consists of an island platform with two faces located on the western side of Springvale Road, with concourses on both sides of the road.

The main concourse, on the western side, comprises a customer service counter, an enclosed waiting room, toilets and a café. The concourse on the eastern side is linked to the platforms via an underpass beneath Springvale Road. Both concourses have stairs and lifts that provide access to the platforms. Both concourses of the station have access to the Ringwood – Box Hill bike path. On the platforms, there are metal benches, vending machines, and passenger information displays. The station car park is on the corner of Laughlin Avenue and Springvale Road.

<text>Hawthorn railway station is a commuter railway station on the Alamein, Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are all part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Hawthorn, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Hawthorn station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 13 April 1861. The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

==History==

Hawthorn station opened when the railway line from Pic-nic was extended across the Yarra River. When it opened, Hawthorn was a terminus, with a single platform, the current Platform 1. In 1882, after the line was extended to Camberwell, an additional platform was constructed. In 1890, an island platform was provided to accommodate the newly opened branch line to Kew, using a canopy from the original Flinders Street station.

In 1963, a third track was provided between Hawthorn and Camberwell, which was extended across the Yarra River to Burnley in 1972. The third track allows bi-directional running on the middle track for express services during peak hour. A signal box at the station was abolished in that same year.

In 1973, bulk briquette handling facilities were abolished at the station and, by 1977, the goods yard was closed altogether, with the siding and connection to the yard abolished in 1978.

By the mid 1980s, the station had not been maintained for many years and was in a dilapidated state. In 1984, the Victorian State Government, with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (The Met), approved a $300,000 face-lift of the station, which included repainting, the re-panelling of the waiting room, the re-cladding of the canopies and landscaping. The refurbishment was completed by May 1986.

==Platforms and services==

<text>Auburn railway station is a commuter railway station on the Alamein, Lilydale and Belgrave lines, which are all part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Hawthorn East, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Auburn station is a ground level host station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 3 April 1882, with the current station provided in 1916.

Initially opened as Auburn Road, the station was given its current name of Auburn on 1 September 1882.

==History==

Auburn station opened on 3 April 1882, when the railway line from Hawthorn was extended to Camberwell. The station was named after two nearby residences which were built in the 1850s. Reverend Henry Liddiard&#x27;s &quot;Auburn Lodge&quot; was built south of Burwood Road, between Glenferrie and Auburn Roads, while John Collings&#x27; &quot;Auburn House&quot; was built south of Liddiard&#x27;s residence in the present day Goodall Street.

The current two-storey station building dates back to 1916, when the line between Hawthorn and Camberwell was regraded. It features brick and stucco facades punctuated by arches, and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

In 1963, a third line was provided between Hawthorn and Camberwell. These works included a new up platform (Platform 1), with Platform 2 becoming a bi-directional platform.

== Platforms and services ==

Auburn has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Lilydale, Belgrave and Alamein line services.

Platform 1:
* weekday all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

<text>Camberwell railway station is a commuter railway station and the junction point for the Alamein, Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are all part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Camberwell, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Camberwell station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform connected by a ramp and accessible overground concourse. It opens on 3 April 1882, with the current station provided in 1919.

==History==

Camberwell station opened on 3 April 1882, when the railway line was extended from Hawthorn. It remained the terminus of the line for a few months in that year, until the railway was extended to Lilydale. When the first section of the Outer Circle line opened in 1891, a new station was built at East Camberwell, to provide an interchange. However, the Outer Circle line quickly failed. By 1898, only the section from East Camberwell to Ashburton remained in operation (later extended to Alamein in 1948), and services for Ashburton began to depart from Camberwell.

In the late 1910s, the line from Hawthorn to Camberwell was regraded, to ease the steep gradient facing down services. Steam locomotives could not pull a fully laden train between the two stations, so peak-hour services had to be split. The locomotive would bring one set of carriages to Camberwell, then return for the other set, causing significant delays. With the regrading, the tracks at Camberwell were sunk into a cutting and the existing station was demolished. In 1919, the current Federation-style station buildings were provided, when the works were completed.

Immediately east of the station, the Alamein line diverges south, with a flyover carrying the southbound line over the Lilydale and Belgrave lines. This flyover was provided in 1959, when the line was duplicated to Riversdale. In 1963, a third line was provided between Hawthorn and Camberwell and, in 1964, the third line was extended to East Camberwell. Also occurring in November of that year, the signal box at Camberwell was the first in Victoria to have push-button signalling installed. In 1972, the centre track was extended to East Camberwell and, in 1974, the platforms were renumbered to their current arrangement.

At around 7:20am on 9 August 1975, a Tait train set rolled away from the station prior to operating an Alamein service. It occurred after the driver and guard left the train and went into the station building. It reached speeds of up to 30kph before it slowed to walking speed near Flinders Street, allowing a driver&#x27;s supervisor to jump aboard and stop the train. No passengers were onboard at the time.

On 27 April 1996, Camberwell was upgraded to a premium station. In 1997, four stabling sidings were constructed on the site of the former goods yard, to replace sidings that were removed at Jolimont Yard, with the sidings brought into service on 5 January 1998. The stabling sidings had been first proposed by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (The Met) in the mid-1980s.

===Redevelopment controversy===
In 2001, the Victorian State Government launched a new metropolitan planning strategy, &quot;Melbourne 2030&quot;, which proposed intensification of development around public transport nodes, such as railway stations and tram routes, along with limits on such development in residential neighbourhoods. The precinct around the station was identified as one of a number of &quot;activity centres&quot; earmarked for redevelopment.

In March 2003, VicTrack announced plans to develop the airspace over the site, including the construction of a deck over the station platforms and adjacent stabling yard, with 3–4 levels of car park, and 3–4 storeys of commercial space. The original plans, involving the station&#x27;s demolition, led to protests from the local community. They received a significant amount of media attention, with actor Geoffrey Rush and comedian Barry Humphries publicly backing the campaign, and heading a protest march up Burke Road from Camberwell Junction to the station. The comedian performed a poem about planners at the rally, and noted that the railway line was sometimes called &quot;The Orient Express&quot;. To those supporting development of the station, the actions of the protesters were seen as an example of NIMBYism.

The Boroondara Residents Action Group worked with architects McGauran Giannini Soon to provide alternative ideas for developing the air-space over the station and yard that were more in-keeping with their view of community preferences, including a small public plaza and a new public library, with some small-scale shops.

Although the station is historic, it is not protected by any of the state&#x27;s heritage listings for any architectural or cultural reasons, and failed to gain that protection when nominated to the Victorian Heritage Register by local residents groups.

In July 2009, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal approved a nine-story development on the site, provided that 14 design modifications were made within 28 days.

In October 2012, VicTrack announced that it had discontinued negotiations with the preferred developer, CSTP Pty Ltd.

<text>East Camberwell railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines, serving the eastern Melbourne suburb of Camberwell in Victoria, Australia. East Camberwell is a ground level unstaffed station featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 14 May 1900, with the current station provided in 1986 following a fire.

A substation is located north-east of the station, along with a former works depot.

==History==

East Camberwell station opened on 14 May 1900, and was originally the interchange station for the &quot;Deepdene Dasher&quot; service, which operated north along the Outer Circle line, that had originally opened in 1891. Three platforms were provided; two high-level platforms for services on the Lilydale line, and a single low-level platform for services on the Outer Circle line. Steps were provided between all platforms, to enable passengers to change between services. Between 1915 and 1922, a signal box at the Melbourne (up) end was provided, to control the junction towards Riversdale (on today&#x27;s Alamein line), as the three tracks through to Camberwell had been reduced to two, to allow the regrading works at Camberwell to proceed. On 9 October 1927, the &quot;Deepdene Dasher&quot; service was withdrawn, and the northern section of the Outer Circle line closed on 6 September 1943, when goods services to East Kew ended. The low level platform was removed after World War II.

In 1964, the platforms on the Lilydale and Belgrave lines were rebuilt, when work to provide a third track between Camberwell and East Camberwell was carried out, with the southern platform converted into an island platform. The track amplification work also removed the bridge that had carried the Lilydale and Belgrave lines over the Outer Circle line. In 1971, the third track was extended to Box Hill.

In 1981, the Edwardian timber station building on Platforms 1 and 2 was replaced with a brick structure, partly due to the perceived fire risk. However, on 12 August 1986, it was destroyed by fire, and was replaced with the current open canopy.

In 1990, actor and comedian Barry Humphries described the station as a &quot;scrawled-on urine-reeking wasteland.&quot;

<text>Canterbury railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Canterbury, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Canterbury station is an elevated unstaffed station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 1 December 1882, with the current station provided in 1968 and platform 3 in 1971.

==History==
Canterbury station opened on 1 December 1882, when the railway line from Camberwell was extended to Lilydale. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Viscount Canterbury, Governor of Victoria between 1866 and 1873.

In the 1930s, a crossover was provided at the southern (up) end of the station, and a signal box provided to work the interlocked level crossing gates.

In early 1966, work on the grade separation of the Canterbury Road level crossing commenced. To facilitate construction, the interlocked gates were replaced with boom barriers, and the signal box was abolished. On 15 September 1968, the current station opened, with all works completed by December of that year. The works involved raising the station six metres, and the use of a temporary track to keep services operating. In December 1971, services on the third track from East Camberwell were extended though the station to Box Hill.

<doc id="642064" wikidata="Q5401769" url="?curid=642064" title="Estragon">
<text>Estragon (affectionately Gogo; he tells Pozzo his name is Adam) is one of the two main characters from Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. His name is the French word for tarragon.

== Personality ==
=== The impulsive misanthrope ===

Estragon represents the impulsive, simplistic side of the two main characters, much in contrast to his companion Vladimir&#x27;s careful intellectualism and verbosity. He cares little for appearances, and is mostly concerned with eating and sleeping (much to Vladimir&#x27;s chagrin). Due to his pessimistic outlook on life, he has abandoned all hope of any alleviation from their suffering, and regards &quot;Godot&quot; suspiciously.

This is perhaps because Estragon has far more to worry about. Of the two, Estragon suffers the most physically. He is kicked by Lucky, takes numerous pratfalls, and is beaten by a gang of thugs every night. He also has great difficulty with his boots. In the first act, they do not fit and cause him pain. At the end of the act, he leaves them on the side of the road in disgust. In the second act, he finds them in the same place, now mysteriously fitting him. This boot focus (in terms of the character being foot centred) may be interpreted as being representative of his lower status (see Vladimir&#x27;s hat) and his &quot;earthy&quot; nature (e.g. his love of carrots, radishes, etc.).

Estragon has a misanthropic view of humanity: he considers people to be &quot;ignorant apes&quot; and seems to want them to leave him alone. However, he is very attached to Vladimir (despite occasionally bickering with him): he needs protection, and Vladimir provides it. Estragon is often seen as the child to Vladimir&#x27;s adult, and as such looks for parental security in him.

=== The poet ===

Estragon should not, however, be written off as merely a childish simpleton. He easily matches Vladimir in verbal melee (he delivers the ultimate insult in calling Vladimir a &quot;Critic!&quot;). He also shows an artistic side, and even claims to have once been a poet. His brief, but evocative, monologue about the &quot;maps of the Holy Land&quot; is very poetic in nature. He can even quote Shelley (with a slight alteration):

Excerpt from Shelley&#x27;s poem:

&quot;Art thou pale for weariness/Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth...&quot;

Estragon&#x27;s play on it:

&quot;Pale for weariness...Of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us.&quot;

== Appearance ==

Estragon is given perhaps the most minimal description in the play. He is only described as wearing &quot;rags&quot;, walking with a limp (that eventually wears off) and being lighter than Vladimir. Because of his rather gluttonous nature, however, he is often played as being short and slightly fat (in comparison to the often tall and lanky Vladimir). His clothes are usually a bit dirtier than Vladimir&#x27;s as well, and seem to be in far worse condition. This interpretation is best attributed to his total lack of restraint and inhibitions (diving for food, sleeping in ditches, etc.).

Many famous actors have taken on the role (especially those of the aforementioned body type), notably Bert Lahr, Sir Ian McKellen, Robin Williams (with Steve Martin as Vladimir), and Keanu Reeves (with Alex Winter as Vladimir). Beckett is even said to have wanted Marlon Brando in one production (with Buster Keaton as Vladimir).

=== Relatives ===

In Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Godot&quot; pastiche, &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, the character Rosencrantz closely resembles Estragon.

It was located between Chatham and Mont Albert and it opened on 13 August 1883 and closed on 17 February 2023, due to the works associated with the Level Crossing Removal Project.

== History ==

Initially, two trains ran to Lilydale each day and five only to Box Hill. At the time, engineers were unwilling to allow trains to stop at Surrey Hills, claiming potential difficulties with re-starting the gradient, and also that there was not enough traffic to warrant the stop.

In April 1883, a deputation asked for Surrey Hills to be a flag station, so that passengers wishing to alight could inform the guard of that at the previous station, while those wishing to join the train could show a red flag, or a red lamp at night. By August of that year, trains would stop on request. On 1 September of that year, Surrey Hills was brought into regular service. The station first appeared in the Victorian Railways working timetable on 15 October of that year.

On 9 December 1888, a second track opened, combined with a new platform on the north side of the line. By the 1930s, a small goods yard had been provided to the south of the station, in what later became a car-park. The connection to the mainline was at the Box Hill (down) end of the station.

In 1962, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Union Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station. In 1966, the goods yard, a signal box, a number of sidings and a crossover were removed to allow work on a third track to be carried out. At that time, the current station buildings were provided, and the former city-bound platform was converted to an island platform. In December 1971, services on the third track from East Camberwell were extended though the station to Box Hill.

In June 2001, Surrey Hills was upgraded to a premium station.

On 14 September 2016, two people were killed when a motor vehicle and an express X&#x27;Trapolis train set collided at the Union Road level crossing. Severe damage resulted to the train, and the vehicle was dragged before coming to a mangled rest between the station platform and train. The station underpass was also damaged.

In 2020, it was announced by the Level Crossing Removal Project that the level crossings at Union and Mont Albert roads would be removed by 2023. The project will involve the closure of both Surrey Hills and nearby Mont Albert, with a brand new railway station at Union, to be provided between the two current stations. Plans for the grade separation of the Union Road level crossing with a road overpass have dated as far back as the late 1970s.

On 17 February 2023, the station was permanently closed for demolition, alongside Mont Albert. The replacement new station, Union, opened on 22 May of that year.

==Platforms and services==

Surrey Hills had one island platform (Platforms 1 and 2) and a side platform (Platform 3), linked by an underpass. The island platform featured a large brick building with a customer service window, an enclosed waiting room and toilets. There was a small brick building on Platform 3.

It was serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Lilydale and Belgrave line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Lilydale
* all stations and limited express services to Belgrave

Platform 3:
* weekday all stations and limited express services to Lilydale; weekday all stations services to Blackburn
* weekday all stations and limited express services to Belgrave; weekday all stations services to Blackburn

==Transport links==

At the time of closure, two bus routes serviced Surrey Hills, both under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

* : Box Hill station – Chadstone Shopping Centre (operated by CDC Melbourne)
* : Box Hill station - Burwood (operated by Ventura Bus Lines)

<doc id="642071" wikidata="Q223840" url="?curid=642071" title="Hardstyle">
<text>Hardstyle is an electronic dance genre that emerged in the late 1990s, with origins in the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. Hardstyle mixes influences from techno, new beat and hardcore.

Early hardstyle was typically written at 140 BPM (&quot;beats per minute&quot;); however, modern hardstyle is faster, produced around 150 BPM. It consisted of overdriven and hard-sounding kick drums, often accompanied by an offbeat bass, known as a &quot;reverse bass&quot;. As the genre grew, the production techniques and songwriting changed to be suited to a more commercial audience. Modern hardstyle can be recognized by its use of synthesizer melodies and distorted sounds, coupled with hardstyle&#x27;s signature combination of percussion and bass. The genre is particularly known for its harmonic use of kickdrums. Due to the sustained nature of a hardstyle kick, producers are able to play basslines by using only the kick itself, which becomes a distinct bass tone through a series of distortion, equalization and layering (among other methods). This technique is known as &quot;pitching&quot; a kick.

The genre gained commercial acceptance in the 2010s, with hardstyle artists performing on the biggest stages in EDM worldwide.

Hardstyle influenced other styles of electronic dance music such as big room house, which began sharing similarities with hardstyle like structures, rhythms, and later, pitching kicks became popular in big room too. Hardstyle also played a large influence in frenchcore and happy hardcore music, which both became popular in the late 2010s with the hardstyle audience after producers started applying hardstyle production techniques and melodic styles to the genres.

==History==
===Origins===
The exact origin of hardstyle cannot be specifically defined; however, it is clear the characteristic of hardstyle originates from hard trance (notably hard trance&#x27;s &#x27;reverse bass&#x27;, and artists such as German deejay Scot Project) with influence from other genres such as hardcore, this genre is what is now known as early hardstyle. As it progressed, the genre gathered characteristics from other electronic music genres and refined its own sound and identity. Over time, the BPM of hardstyle music increased, from a range of 135 to 150 to a range of 150 to 160. Some hardcore producers brought hardstyle elements back to the hardcore scene, which made modern hardstyle and hardcore very similar and often indistinguishable in some cases, only differing in BPM.

The first event credited as a hardstyle event was Qlubtempo, which took place in the year 2000 in Zaandam. Qlubtempo was the first event produced by Q-dance, a Dutch event company which would later go on to produce hardstyle festivals in other countries in Europe, Australia, North America, South America and Asia. In 2001, Q-dance produced the first edition of Qlimax. Q-dance trademarked the term &quot;hardstyle&quot; on the 4th of July, 2002, after both Qlimax and Qlubtempo proved to be successful. Since its inception, Q-dance has guided the evolution of hardstyle music with its events and is often involved with hardstyle artists on a creative level. In 2003, Q-dance hosted the first edition of Defqon.1.

The first few years of hardstyle were characterized by a tempo of around 140–150 BPM, a distorted kick drum sound, vocal samples, dissonant synth sounds known as &quot;screetches&quot; and the use of a &quot;reverse bass&quot;, a hard kick distorted offbeat bass within the same beat. Around 2002, more hardstyle labels emerged. Fusion Records (with DJ Zany and others) and Scantraxx (founded by Dov Elkabas) were the two largest Dutch Hardstyle labels in that period. At this point in time, hardstyle artists were primarily from either the Netherlands or Italy.

==Subgenres==
===Early hardstyle===
Early hardstyle is a modern name for what was at the time called &quot;hardstyle&quot;, the genre is focused mostly on reverse bass kicks, which can still be found in songs today as a pre-drop.

===Nustyle===
====Euphoric hardstyle====
From roughly 2010 onwards, the move towards a more melodic emphasis from older hardstyle evolved into the subgenre &quot;euphoric hardstyle&quot;, characterized by highly emotional melodies and heavy pitch-shifting of kicks.

==== Trapstyle ====
The Trapstyle is a sub-genre of the hardstyle scene linked to trap which appeared in the mid- 2010s. It was pioneered by Pittsburgh DJ, Black Daddy, CEO and Founder of Hardstyle Family. 

====Dubstyle====
In early 2010, a new variation in hardstyle, named dubstyle was introduced. Dubstyle is the name given to the genre fusion of hardstyle and dubstep. Dubstyle tends to have reversed wobble basslines and takes the kick styling of hardstyle tracks, while combining them with the rhythm, groove and dubstep tempo and effects a fusion of elements of hardstyle with a dubstep rhythm, usually a 2-step or a breakstep rhythm.

<doc id="642072" wikidata="Q751327" url="?curid=642072" title="Socket 478">
<text>Socket 478, also known as mPGA478 or mPGA478B, is a 478-contact CPU socket used for Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 and Celeron series CPUs. 

Socket 478 was launched in August 2001 in advance of the Northwood core to compete with AMD&#x27;s 462-pin Socket A and their Athlon XP processors. Socket 478 was intended to be the replacement for Socket 423, a Willamette-based processor socket which was on the market for only a short time. 

This was the last Intel desktop socket to use a pin grid array (PGA) interface. All later Intel desktop sockets use a land grid array (LGA) interface.

Socket 478 was phased out with the launch of LGA 775 in 2004.

==Technical specifications==
Socket 478 was used for all Northwood Pentium 4 and Celeron processors. It supported the first Prescott Pentium 4 processors and all Willamette Celerons, along with several of the Willamette-series Pentium 4s. Socket 478 also supported the newer Prescott-based Celeron D processors (which were also one of the last CPUs made for the socket), and early Pentium 4 Extreme Edition processors with 2 MB of L3 CPU cache.

While Intel&#x27;s mobile CPUs are available in 478-pin packages, they in fact only operate in a range of slightly differing sockets such as Socket 479, Socket M, and Socket P, all of which are electrically incompatible with each other including Socket 478.

Socket 478 is used in combination with DDR SDRAM, as well as SDR SDRAM, RDRAM and DDR2 SDRAM.

== Heatsink ==
The 4 holes for fastening the heatsink to the motherboard are placed in a rectangle with lateral lengths of 60 mm and 75 mm.

==Mechanical load limits==
All sockets (Pentium 4 and Celeron) have the following mechanical maximum load limits which should not be exceeded during heatsink assembly, shipping conditions, or standard use. Load above those limits may crack the processor die and make it unusable. The limits are included in the table below.

<text>Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, Duke of Aiguillon (&quot;Armand Désiré&quot;; 31 October 1761 – 4 May 1800), was a French military officer and politician. 

==Life and career==

He was the only son of Emmanuel-Armand de Vignerot du Plessis-Richelieu and his wife, Louise-Félicité de Bréhan. In 1788, he succeeded his father as Duke of Aiguillon.

In 1789, as a member of the National Assembly, he became one of the first to ally himself with the Third Estate and to renounce the privileges of the nobility. He became a general in the Republican Army, but had to flee during the Reign of Terror of 1793–1794.

According to Michael Kelly in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, the Duke of Aiguillon was, in 1796, in London with the revolutionaries Charles Lameth and the orator Dupont. He states that the duke had been &#x27;one of the twelve peers of France, who, in former days, had an immense fortune, was a great patron of the arts, and so theatrical that he had a box in every theatre in Paris. He was particularly fond of music, and had been a pupil of Viotti (then leader of the Opera House orchestra, at which Kelly was stage manager).&#x27; Kelly introduced them to Richard Brinsley Sheridan and other friends, though the Duke of Queensberry refused to meet the Duke of Aiguillon. 

On learning that the Duke of Aiguillon&#x27;s fortune was entirely lost or sequestered, Kelly arranged for him to make a little money by copying sheet-music, which he did secretly during the day, continuing to attend the theatre in the evening. Eventually, an order came from the Alien Office of the British Government that he and his friends must leave England in two days. The duke went to Hamburg where he died. The duke left his favourite Danish dog in Kelly&#x27;s care, shedding many tears on parting from it: the animal outlived its master, but pined and died soon afterwards.

<doc id="642080" wikidata="Q778292" url="?curid=642080" title="Three Red Banners">
<text>Three Red Banners () was an ideological slogan in the late 1950s which called on the Chinese people to build a socialist state. The &quot;Three Red Banners&quot; also called the &quot;Three Red Flags,&quot; consisted of the General Line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward and the people&#x27;s communes.

After the first Five-Year Plan, the People&#x27;s Republic of China continued its socialist construction by introducing &quot;Three Red Banners Movement&quot;. The General Line directed the Chinese people to &quot;go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.&quot; By the end of 1958, nearly all Chinese peasants had been organized into communes averaging 5000 households each. All privately owned property was taken for or contributed to the communes and people were not allowed to cook their own food and instead ate in communal dining halls.

The Great Leap Forward, begun in 1958, was a campaign to rapidly modernize by using China&#x27;s vast labor resources in agricultural and industrial projects. The Leap instead resulted in economic destruction and tens of millions of famine deaths, and had been mostly abandoned by early 1962. Membership in communes was gradually reduced in the early 1960s, with some private property ownership and enterprise again being allowed. The communes continued until being dismantled in the early 1980s under Deng Xiaoping.

<doc id="642083" wikidata="Q293679" url="?curid=642083" title="Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud">
<text>Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud (; born 7 March 1955) is a Saudi Arabian billionaire businessman, investor, and a House of Saud royal. In 2008, he was listed on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Time 100&quot;, an annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world. Al Waleed is a grandson of Abdulaziz, the first king of Saudi Arabia, and of Riad Al Solh, Lebanon&#x27;s first prime minister.

Al Waleed is the founder, chief executive officer and 95 percent owner of the Kingdom Holding Company, a company with investments in companies in the financial services, tourism and hospitality, mass media, entertainment, retail, agriculture, petrochemicals, aviation, technology, and real-estate sectors. In 2013, the company had a market capitalization of over $18 billion. He owns Paris&#x27; Four Seasons Hotel George V and part of New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel. &quot;Time&quot; has called him the &quot;Arabian Warren Buffett&quot;. In November 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Al Waleed as the 7th-richest man in the world, with a net worth of $39.8 billion.

On 4 November 2017, Al Waleed and other prominent Saudis (including fellow billionaires Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim and Saleh Abdullah Kamel) were arrested in Saudi Arabia, in a purge that the Saudi government characterized as an anti-corruption drive. The allegations against Al Waleed include money laundering, bribery, and extorting officials. 
Some of the detainees were held in the Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh. Al Waleed was released from detention on 27 January 2018, following a financial settlement of some kind, after nearly three months in detention. In March 2018 he was dropped from the World&#x27;s Billionaires list due to lack of current information. He was listed in the &#x27;Top 100 most powerful Arabs&#x27; from 2013 to 2021 by &quot;Gulf Business&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Al Waleed bin Talal was born in Jeddah on 7 March 1955 to Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz and Mona El Solh. His father was Saudi Arabia&#x27;s finance minister during the early 1960s, before he went into exile due to his advocacy for political reform. Al Waleed&#x27;s paternal grandparents were King Abdulaziz and Munaiyir. His grandmother, an Armenian, was presented by the emir of Unayzah to King Abdulaziz in 1921, when she was 12 years old and Abdulaziz was 45. His maternal grandparents were Riad Al Solh, the first prime minister of Lebanon, and Fayza Al Jabiri, the sister of Syrian Prime Minister Saadallah al-Jabiri.

Al Waleed&#x27;s parents separated when he was seven, and he lived with his mother in Lebanon. He first attended Pinewood College in Beirut. As a boy, he ran away from home for a day or two at a time, sleeping in unlocked cars, before attending the King Abdulaziz Military Academy in Riyadh. In 1974, he returned to Lebanon, attending the Choueifat School and then Manor School. Al Waleed received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from Menlo College in California in 1979, finishing in two-and-a-half years, and a master&#x27;s degree with honors in social science from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1985, finishing in eleven months.

==Business career==
Al Waleed began his business career in 1979 after graduating from Menlo College. He returned to Saudi Arabia, which was in the midst of the 1974–85 oil boom. Operating from a small, four-room cabin in Riyadh and $30,000 start-up money provided by his father, Al Waleed formed Kingdom Establishment in 1980. When that money ran out in a few months, he secured a $300,000 loan from the Saudi American Bank, partly owned by Citibank. Rather than taking a commission for facilitating contracts as the legally required middleman, Al Waleed insisted on a stake in the project. His first success was in 1982, partnering with a South Korean construction company, and from then on, his commissions were used to fund his real estate deals. In his own words, &quot;All the money I used to get from this construction I would plough back into real estate, and in the stock market, both.&quot;

After the end of the Saudi oil boom, Al Waleed acquired the underperforming United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB). Through mergers with Saudi Cairo Bank (SCB), forming United Saudi Bank (USB), and the Saudi American Bank (SAMBA), it became a leading Middle Eastern bank. The hostile takeover of USCB in 1986, the merger with SCB in 1997, and the merger of USB with SAMBA in 1999, were the first of their kind in the Kingdom. He then secured a majority in Al-Azizia Panda, merging it with the Savola Group, and took over National Industrialization Company.

By 1989, his net worth was $1.4 billion, and included stakes in Canary Wharf, Four Seasons Hotel Group, and News Corporation. When Al Waleed turned to the international market, he focused on &quot;established brands going through hard times,&quot; as Riz Khan puts it. Al Waleed would do his homework, and then wait for the proper purchase entry point. He invested about $250 million in Chase Manhattan, Citigroup, Manufacturers Hanover, and Chemical Bank. After seven months, he sold his stakes in the other banks and concentrated on investing in Citicorp, acquiring 4.9 percent of the bank. Though the worst performing bank of the four, Al Waleed considered Citicorp had the best potential.

In September 1990, Citibank was undercapitalized due to real estate credit losses and exposure to Latin America debt, prompting a need for a capital reserve. By November, they were actively seeking investors. Based on his banking experience in the Kingdom, Al Waleed agreed in January 1991 to invest $590 million, about half his accumulated wealth, in a five-year convertible security paying 11 percent interest. By Feb., that took his total investment in Citicorp to $797 million, or about 15 percent of the company. Though he had received a Federal Reserve temporary waiver to own such a large portion of the company, Al Waleed sold enough shares in 1993 to get below the 10 percent threshold. Still, he was the largest shareholder in the largest US financial institution at the time. Yet, in Alwaleed&#x27;s words, &quot;It is not a relationship, it&#x27;s an alliance. We are there forever with them.&quot; Sandy Weill says of Al Waleed, &quot;I think what he did really saved the bank.&quot;

In 1993, Al Waleed purchased a 10 percent stake in Saks Fifth Avenue for $100 million. A flagship store was then opened in Riyadh.

In 1994, Al Waleed secured a 50 percent controlling interest in Fairmont, and a 22 percent stake in the Four Seasons. In 1995, he bought a 42 percent stake in the Plaza Hotel, and it was reported that he was working on a music channel for his satellite TV platform.

Then, in 1996, he bought the George V for $185 million, and spent $120 million renovating it for a reopening in Dec 1999. Regarding Al Waleed&#x27;s investment in the George V, Issy Sharp states, &quot;...he created value where no one else could...&quot;

In the same year, Al Waleed purchased a 24 percent stake in Euro Disney for $345 million.

In 1995, Kingdom Establishment for Trading and Contracting was reorganized as the Kingdom Holding Company, and Al Waleed announced construction of the Kingdom Centre, Kingdom Hospital, Kingdom School and Kingdom City. Also in 1995, he bought a 2.3 percent share of Mediaset after having invested earlier in the Arab Radio and Television Network, acquiring 30 percent. In October 1995, Al Waleed joined a consortium which paid $1.2 billion for control of Canary Wharf, with his share of the company amounting to 6 percent, costing him $66 million.

In March 1997, Al Waleed purchased a 5 percent stake in Apple Inc., making him the largest shareholder. In Nov. 1997, he purchased 1 percent share of Motorola for $287 million and a five percent share of Netscape for $146 million, before its purchase by AOL and merger with Time Warner. In 2001 and 2002, Al Waleed increased his stake in AOL Time Warner by another $540 million. He also invested in MCI, Fox Broadcasting and other technology and media companies.

&quot;Time&quot; reported in 1997 that Al Waleed owned about five percent of News Corporation, which he purchased for $400 million, making him the third largest shareholder. In April 1999, Al Waleed purchased an additional $200 million of preferred shares. In 2010, his News Corporation stake was about seven percent ($3 billion). Three years later, News Corporation had a $175 million (19-percent) investment in Al Waleed&#x27;s Rotana Group, the Arab world&#x27;s largest entertainment company. A review of his holdings implied that Al Waleed had sold his investment in AOL.

In April 1997, Al Waleed purchased a 4 percent stake in Planet Hollywood for $57 million, and another 16 percent in November 1998 for $45 million.

In October 1997, Al Waleed bought 27 percent of Mövenpick Hotels &amp; Resorts, which he increased to 33 percent in 2003.

In 1999, &quot;The Economist&quot; expressed doubts about the source of his income, wondering if he was a front man for other Saudi investors:

He has not earned enough income from his investments to pay for all that he has spent in the 1990s. The mystery goes back to that first stake in Citicorp. The prince has declared that this money came entirely from his personal funds. He says he started out in 1979 with a loan of just $30,000 from his father. He also mortgaged a house that his father had given him, raising something like $400,000. And each month, as a grandson of Ibn Saud, he receives $15,000. You could barely clothe a Saudi prince for such sums, let alone furnish him with a multi-billion-dollar empire. Nevertheless, by 1991 Prince Alwaleed had felt able to risk an investment of $797m in Citicorp.

Al Waleed invested in WorldCom, Priceline.com, Coca-Cola, and Ford Motor Company, totaling almost $2 billion. In Asia, he bought 5.9 percent of Daewoo for $50 million, which he increased to 18 percent with an additional $100 million investment, 3 percent of PROTON Holdings for $46 million, 3 percent of Ong Beng Seng&#x27;s Hotel Properties Ltd., and $50 million worth of Hyundai Motor Company bonds. In Africa, he invested $50 million, acquiring 10 percent of Sonatel, 10 percent of Ecobank, 13.7 percent of United Bank for Africa, and 14 percent of CAL Bank. Investments which turned out poorly included WorldCom, Priceline, Teledesic, and KirchMedia, besides Planet Hollywood and Euro Disney.

His stake in Apple was sold in 2005. Al Waleed also invested in Eastman Kodak and TWA, both of which performed moderately well.

In 2002, Al Waleed formed Kingdom Hotel Investments to oversee his hotel assets.

By 2003, Al Waleed owned 100 percent of Rotana, and 49 percent of LBC Sat.

His real-estate holdings included large stakes in the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel; Al Waleed sold half his shares in the Plaza in August 2004. He has invested in London&#x27;s Savoy Hotel and Monaco&#x27;s Monte Carlo Grand Hotel. Al Waleed holds a ten-percent stake in Euro Disney S.C.A., the company which owns, manages and maintains Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée.

The 2004 &quot;Forbes&quot; list of wealthiest people had Al Waleed fourth, with a net worth of $21.5 billion. More than $1.3 billion was in hotel holdings.
In January 2005, Al Waleed purchased the Savoy Hotel in London for an estimated £250 million, to be managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts; his sister, Sultana Nurul, owns an estimated 16 percent stake. In January 2006, in partnership with the U.S. real-estate firm Colony NorthStar, Kingdom Holding acquired Toronto-based Fairmont Hotels and Resorts for an estimated $3.9 billion. It was reported in 2009 that Al Waleed owned 35 percent of Research and Marketing Group (SRMG), a large mid-east media company.

In August 2011, Al Waleed announced that his company had contracted with the Saudi Binladin Group to build the world&#x27;s tallest building, the Kingdom Tower (at a height of at least ) for SR 4.6 billion. The original plan—announced in 2008—called it برج الميل (Arabic for &quot;One-Mile Tower&quot;), at a height of and an estimated cost of $20 billion.

In December 2011, Al Waleed invested $300 million in Twitter, purchasing secondary shares from insiders. The purchase gave Kingdom Holding &quot;more than 3% share&quot; in the company, which was valued at $8 billion in late summer 2011.

In 2015, he announced that he would donate his fortune to charity at an unspecified date. He had previously donated $3.5 billion over the course of 35 years through his charitable organization Alwaleed Philanthropies.

From 2015 to 2021, he lost several lawsuits against Pierre El Daher, CEO of LBCI, and would be required to pay $22m, due to breaches in contract conditions with the Lebanese broadcaster.

In May 2022, he was listed as committing to purchase approximately 35 million shares of Twitter Inc. at or immediately prior to the purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk and other private-equity investors behind Musk&#x27;s bid.

==Arrest and release==

On 4 November 2017, Al Waleed was one of those arrested in Saudi Arabia in a &quot;corruption crackdown&quot; conducted by a new royal anti-corruption committee. In total, 320 princes, ministers and businessmen were detained at the five-star Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh. This was done on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who acted with the aim of consolidating his position as the next ruler of the kingdom. Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is Al Waleed&#x27;s first cousin; both are male-line grandsons of Ibn Saud, first monarch and founder of Saudi Arabia.

Al Waleed and most of the other Saudi notables arrested made financial settlements of some kind with the Saudi government before they were released. In his case, as in the case of most of the other detainees, the Saudi Arabian government did not disclose charges or produce evidence, and the negotiations were held in secret. In December, some weeks after the arrests, it was reported that the Saudi Arabian authorities were demanding $6 billion from Prince Al Waleed bin Talal in exchange for his release.

Al Waleed was released from detention in late January 2018, nearly three months after his arrest. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the price for his release was $6 billion. In comparison, his first cousin Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, son of the late King Abdullah (1924–2015), was released after reportedly paying $1 billion.

Just days before his arrest, Al Waleed reportedly contacted US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi (who had publicly criticized the Saudi government in the past) and invited him to return to the Kingdom to contribute to Mohammad bin Salman&#x27;s vision.

==&quot;Forbes&quot; dispute ==
In 2013, Kerry Dolan, editor of &quot;Forbes&quot;″ annual billionaires&#x27; list, wrote an article accompanying the list entitled &quot;Prince Alwaleed and the Curious Case of Kingdom Holding Stock&quot;. According to Dolan, Al Waleed attached great importance to the &quot;Forbes&quot; list and she alleged a correlation between changes in the share price of Kingdom Holdings and the annual run-up to the list&#x27;s publication. In the &quot;Forbes&quot; article, Dolan wrote that Al Waleed would blind copy Dolan on text messages he sent to prominent people in an attempt to impress her. She spent a week with him in Riyadh in 2008, at his behest, touring his palaces. In 2006 &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Al Waleed&#x27;s net worth at $7 billion less than he claimed. He telephoned Dolan at home, according to the editor, &quot;nearly in tears&quot;. Al Waleed had Kingdom Holding&#x27;s chief financial officer fly to New York before a previous list was published to ensure that &quot;Forbes&quot; used his stated numbers.

The article explains the methodology behind &quot;Forbes&quot;″ 2013 estimate of his wealth at $20 billion, examines Kingdom Holdings&#x27; share performance and contains Dolan&#x27;s communications with Kingdom Holdings CFO Shadi Sanbar. Sanbar demanded that Al Waleed&#x27;s name be removed from the billionaires&#x27; list if &quot;Forbes&quot; did not increase its valuation of his wealth. Dolan wrote, &quot;As &quot;Forbes&quot; asked increasingly specific questions in the process of fact-checking this story, the prince acted unilaterally the day before it was published, announcing through his office that he would &#x27;sever ties&#x27; with the list.&quot; Sanbar said in a press release, &quot;Prince Alwaleed has taken this step as he felt he could no longer participate in a process which resulted in the use of incorrect data and seemed designed to disadvantage Middle Eastern investors and institutions.&quot;

Al Waleed said in a March 2013 interview with &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; that he would pursue legal action against &quot;Forbes&quot;. &quot;They are accusing me of market manipulation,&quot; Al Waleed said. &quot;This is all wrong and a false statement. We will fight it all the way against &quot;Forbes&quot;.&quot; He called the &quot;Forbes&quot; list &quot;flawed and inaccurate&quot;, saying that it &quot;displays bias against Middle East investors and financial institutions.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that on 6 June 2013, Al Waleed had brought a defamation claim in London against the publisher of &quot;Forbes&quot;; its editor, Randall Lane, and two journalists from the magazine. &quot;Forbes&quot; expressed surprise at the libel action and the fact that it was filed in London. According to the magazine, &quot;The Prince&#x27;s suit would be precisely the kind of libel tourism that the UK&#x27;s recently passed libel reform law is intended to thwart. We would anticipate that the London high court will agree. &quot;Forbes&quot; stands by its story.&quot; As of 20 June, &quot;Forbes&quot; had not been served with papers.

A statement issued by the Kingdom Holding Company accused &quot;Forbes&quot; of publishing a &quot;deliberately insulting and inaccurate description of the business community in Saudi Arabia and specifically, &quot;Forbes&quot;″ denigration of the Saudi stock exchange (Tadawul), which is one of the most regulated in the world&quot;. According to Al Waleed, the magazine used an &quot;irrational and deeply flawed valuation methodology, which is ultimately subjective and discriminatory&quot;.

On 16 June 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; and Al Waleed released a joint statement announcing that they had settled their dispute &quot;on mutually agreeable terms&quot;. The opening of the Saudi stock exchange to foreign investors was cited as key in the defendants&#x27; willingness to consider the stock price of Al Waleed&#x27;s publicly traded Kingdom Holding Company in valuing the KHC component of his wealth.

== Political views ==
Al Waleed tweeted a statement with a picture of himself holding an honorary Palestinian passport, &quot;In response to the news of the visit to Israel: I have not and will not visit Jerusalem or pray inside it until its liberation from the Zionist enemy. And I carry an honorary Palestinian passport&quot;.

In 2015, Al Waleed was criticised for offering to buy Bentley cars for Saudi fighter pilots involved in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In a tweet later deleted, he said: &quot;In appreciation of their role in this operation, I&#x27;m honoured to offer 100 Bentley cars to the 100 Saudi [fighter] pilots&quot;.

Al Waleed advocates for pragmatic governance, praises Giorgia Meloni’s centrist approach, and aligns with Donald Trump on social issues.

==Philanthropy==
In July 1997, Al Waleed invested $10 million with the Palestinian Investment and Development Company (PADICO), and then helped cofound the Jerusalem Development and Investment Company (JEDICO).

In 2002, Al Waleed donated $500,000 to help fund the George Herbert Walker Bush scholarship at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He donated £18.5 million to Palestinian families during a TV telethon ordered by Saudi King Fahd to help relatives of Palestinians after Israeli operations in the West Bank city of Jenin. In 2004, he contributed $17 million to victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

On 1 July 2015, Al Waleed held a press conference announcing his intention to donate $32 billion to philanthropic causes. He said that the funds would be used for humanitarian projects such as the empowerment of women and youth, disaster relief, disease eradication and building bridges of understanding between cultures.

===Donation after 11 September attacks===
After the 11 September attacks, Al Waleed gave a cheque for $10 million to New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, despite Saudi opposition. In a written statement after his donation, Al Waleed said: &quot;At times like this, we must address some of the issues that led to such a criminal attack. I believe the government of the United States of America should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stance toward the Palestinian cause.&quot; As a result of that statement, Giuliani returned his cheque. Al Waleed said to a Saudi weekly magazine about Giuliani&#x27;s rejection of his check, &quot;The whole issue is that I spoke about their position [on the Middle East conflict] and they didn&#x27;t like it because there are Jewish pressures and they are afraid of them.&quot;

Giuliani replied to this by suggesting that Al Waleed&#x27;s comment was actually part of the problem: &quot;There is no moral equivalent for this [terrorist] act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they&#x27;re part of the problem.&quot;

===Western universities===
In 2005, Al Waleed gave Georgetown University $20 million to create the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU) in the university&#x27;s School of Foreign Service, the second largest donation in the school&#x27;s history. On 8 May 2008, Al Waleed gave £16 million to Edinburgh University to fund a &quot;centre for the study of Islam in the contemporary world&quot;. He has also endowed the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Center for American Studies and Research (CASAR). The Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medical College is named for Al Waleed. The Centre of Islamic Studies at the University of Cambridge and the Islamic Studies Program at Harvard University are also named after him. At his alma mater Syracuse University, Al Waleed is an honorary member of the advisory board of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

===First Saudi female pilot===
Al Waleed is considered a proponent of female emancipation in the Arab world. He financed the training of Hanadi Zakaria al-Hindi as the first Saudi woman commercial airline pilot, and said at her graduation that he is &quot;in full support of Saudi ladies working in all fields&quot;. Al-Hindi became certified to fly within Saudi Arabia in 2014.

==Assets==
Al Waleed owns the 65th-largest private yacht in the world, the &quot;Kingdom 5KR&quot; (originally built as the &quot;Nabila&quot; for Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi in 1979). In 1983, owned by Khashoggi, it appeared as the &quot;Flying Saucer&quot; (the yacht of James Bond&#x27;s villain, Largo) in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. It was sold to Donald Trump, who renamed her the &quot;Trump Princess&quot;. Al Waleed bought the yacht after Trump experienced financial problems in the late 1980s.

Al Waleed ordered a yacht known as the &quot;New Kingdom 5KR&quot;, about long with an estimated cost of over $500 million. The yacht is designed by Lindsey Design, and its design was delivered in late 2010. 

He owns several aircraft converted for private use: a Boeing 747, an Airbus A321 and a Hawker Siddeley 125. Al Waleed was the first individual to purchase an Airbus A380 and was due to take delivery of it in the spring of 2013, but it was sold before delivery.

Among his assets are a 95-percent stake in Kingdom Holding Company; 91-percent ownership of Rotana Video and Audio Visual Company; 90-percent ownership of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation; seven-percent ownership of News Corporation; about six-percent ownership of Citigroup, and a 17-percent ownership of &quot;Al Nahar&quot; and a 25-percent ownership of &quot;Ad-Diyar&quot; (two daily newspapers published in Lebanon). Al Waleed topped the first Saudi Rich List in 2009, with assets of $16.3 billion.

===Palaces===
Al Waleed owns three palaces: two existing and a third under construction. The Kingdom Palace, in central Riyadh, is his primary home. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Al Waleed lives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in a $130 million sand-colored palace whose 317 rooms are adorned with 1,500 tons of Italian marble, silk oriental carpets, gold-plated faucets and 250 TVs. It has four kitchens, for Arabic, Continental and Asian cuisines, and a fourth just for dishing up desserts, run by chefs who can feed 2,000 people on an hour&#x27;s notice. There is also a lagoon-shaped pool and a 45-seat basement cinema&quot;. The Kingdom Resort, also in central Riyadh, has three lakes interspersed with gardens. The Kingdom Oasis, under construction, will have a lake and a private zoo.

===Awards===
Al Waleed received the first order of the Order of King Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia in 2002 and is a recipient of the Lebanese National Order of the Cedar. On 2 December 2009, he received the Order of Izzudin from Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed; that year he also received the Star of Palestine, the highest honour conferred by the State of Palestine. In 2010, Al Waleed received the Dwight D. Eisenhower Award for Innovation. He received the Bahrain Medal of the First Order, the country&#x27;s highest honorary medal in late May 2012. He received the Nepalese third-order Mahaujjval Rastradip Manpadvi, the highest award bestowed on a foreigner, and Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s Colina De Boe Medal in August 2012. In June 2013 Al Waleed was made Grand Commander of the Order of the Republic of Sierra Leone (GCRSL), the country&#x27;s highest honour. On 13 December 2014, he was made an Honorary Companion of the National Order of Merit of the Republic of Malta.

==Personal life==
Al Waleed has been married multiple times. His first marriage was in 1976, at the age of 19. His first wife was his cousin, Princess Dalal bint Saud, a daughter of King Saud. They have two children (Prince Khaled, born on 21 April 1978 and Princess Reem, born on 20 June 1982), and later divorced, in December 1994.

In 1996, Al Waleed married Princess Iman Sudairi, but the marriage lasted only approximately a year. After divorcing his second wife, Al Waleed married Kholood Al Anazi, in 1999. They were divorced in 2004.

His fourth wife was Ameera al-Taweel; after about six years of marriage, they divorced in 2014. In an interview, he said: &quot;Yes, I announce it through &quot;Okaz&quot;—&quot;Saudi Gazette&quot; for the first time. I have officially separated from Princess Ameera Al-Taweel, but she remains a person that I have all respect for.&quot;

<doc id="642084" wikidata="Q4075481" url="?curid=642084" title="Joseph Beyrle">
<text>Joseph R. Beyrle (pron. BYE-er-lee) (; romanized: &quot;Dzhozef Vilyamovich Bayyerli&quot;; August 25, 1923 – December 12, 2004) is the only known American soldier to have served in combat with both the United States Army and the Soviet Red Army in World War II. He took part in Mission Albany, the airborne landings of the 101st Airborne Division on June 5–6, 1944, as a member of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. He was captured by the Germans and sent east as a prisoner of war.

After several unsuccessful attempts, Beyrle escaped from the German Stalag III-C in January 1945 and joined a Soviet tank battalion under the command of Aleksandra Samusenko. Wounded, he was evacuated and eventually made his way to the United States in April 1945. Beyrle died in 2004 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His son John Beyrle later became the United States Ambassador to Russia.

==Early life==

Joseph Beyrle was the third of seven children born to William and Elizabeth Beyrle, whose parents had come to America from Germany in the 1800s. He was six years old when the Great Depression struck; his father, a factory worker, lost his job. The family was evicted from their home and was forced to move in with Joseph&#x27;s grandmother. Some of his earliest memories, Beyrle later told his children, were of standing in government food lines with his father. His two older brothers dropped out of high school and joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, an unemployment work-relief program, sending home enough money to allow the rest of the family to stay together. His older sister died of scarlet fever at age 16.

==US Army==
Upon his enlistment, Beyrle volunteered to become a paratrooper, and after completing basic airborne infantry training at Camp Toccoa he was assigned to the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, the &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot;. Beyrle specialized in radio communications and demolition, and was first stationed in Ramsbury, England, to prepare for the upcoming Allied invasion from the west. After nine months of training, Beyrle completed two missions in occupied France in April and May 1944, delivering gold to the French Resistance.

On 6 June, D-Day, Beyrle&#x27;s C-47 came under enemy fire over the Normandy coast, and he was forced to jump from the exceedingly low altitude of . After landing in Saint-Côme-du-Mont, Sergeant Beyrle lost contact with his fellow paratroopers, but succeeded in blowing up a power station. He performed other sabotage missions before being captured by German soldiers a few days later.

==Prisoner of war==

Over the next seven months, Beyrle was held in seven German prisons. He escaped twice, and was both times recaptured. Beyrle and his fellow prisoners had been hoping to find the Red Army, which was a short distance away. After the second escape (in which he and his companions set out for Poland but boarded a train to Berlin by mistake), Beyrle was turned over to the Gestapo by a German civilian. Beaten and tortured, he was released to the German military after officials stepped in and determined that the Gestapo had no jurisdiction over prisoners of war. The Gestapo were about to shoot Beyrle and his comrades, claiming that he was an American spy who had parachuted into Berlin.

Beyrle was taken to the Stalag III-C POW camp in Alt Drewitz, from which he escaped in early January 1945. He headed east, hoping to meet up with the Soviet army. Encountering a Soviet tank brigade in the middle of January, he raised his hands, holding a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, and shouted in Russian, &#x27;Amerikansky tovarishch! (&quot;American comrade!&quot;). Beyrle was eventually able to persuade the battalion&#x27;s commander (Aleksandra Samusenko, reportedly the only female tank officer of that rank in the war) to allow him to fight alongside the unit on its way to Berlin. Beyrle began a month-long stint in a Soviet tank battalion, where his demolitions expertise was appreciated.

==Soviet Army==
Beyrle&#x27;s new battalion was the one that freed his former camp, Stalag III-C, at the end of January, but in the first week of February, he was wounded during an attack by German dive bombers. He was evacuated to a Soviet hospital in Landsberg an der Warthe (now Gorzów Wielkopolski in Poland), where he received a visit from Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who, intrigued by the only non-Soviet in the hospital, learned his story through an interpreter, and provided Beyrle with official papers in order to rejoin American forces.

Joining a Soviet military convoy, Beyrle arrived at the U.S. embassy in Moscow in February 1945, only to learn that he had been reported by the U.S. War Department as killed in action on June 10, 1944, in France. A funeral mass had been held in his honor in Muskegon, and his obituary was published in the local newspaper. Embassy officers in Moscow, unsure of his bona fides, placed him under Marine guard in the Metropol Hotel until his identity was established through his fingerprints.

==Post-military==
Beyrle returned home to Michigan on April 21, 1945, and celebrated V-E Day two weeks later in Chicago. He was married to JoAnne Hollowell in 1946 in the same church and by the same priest who had held his funeral mass two years earlier. Beyrle worked for Brunswick Corporation for 28 years, retiring as a shipping supervisor.

His unique service earned him medals from U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House marking the 50th anniversary of D-Day in 1994.

==Death and legacy==
Beyrle died in his sleep of heart failure on December 12, 2004, during a visit to Toccoa, Georgia, where he had trained as a paratrooper in 1942. He was 81. He was buried with honors in Section 1 of Arlington National Cemetery in April, 2005.

Beyrle and his wife JoAnne had a daughter, Julie, and two sons. The elder son, Joe Beyrle II, served in the 101st Airborne during the Vietnam War. His son John Beyrle served as the United States Ambassador to Russia 2008–2012.

On September 17, 2002, a book by Thomas Taylor about Beyrle, &quot;The Simple Sounds of Freedom&quot;, was published by Random House. A Ballantine paperback version, &quot;Behind Hitler&#x27;s Lines&quot;, came out June 1, 2004.

In 2005, a plaque was unveiled on the wall of the church in Saint-Côme-du-Mont, France, where Beyrle landed on June 6, 1944. A permanent plaque was dedicated at the site on July 5, 2014.

An exhibition devoted to Joe Beyrle&#x27;s life and wartime experiences was shown in Moscow and three other Russian cities in 2010. The exhibition opened a four-city American tour at The National World War II Museum in New Orleans, with showings in Toccoa and Omaha in 2011, and Beyrle&#x27;s hometown of Muskegon in June 2012. A permanent installation of the exhibition is now on display at the USS Silversides Museum in Muskegon.

<doc id="642086" wikidata="Q466228" url="?curid=642086" title="Bronislav Kaminski">
<text>Bronislav Vladislavovich Kaminski (, 16 June 1899 – 28 August 1944) was a Soviet Nazi collaborator. Some publications mistakenly give Kaminski&#x27;s first name as &quot;Mieczyslaw&quot;.

Kaminski was the commander of the eponymous Kaminski Brigade, an anti-partisan and rear-security formation made up of people from the so-called Lokot Autonomy territory (1941–1943) in part of the German-occupied area of the Soviet Union. The Kaminski Brigade later became part of the Waffen-SS as the &quot;SS Sturmbrigade RONA&quot; (&quot;Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya&quot; — Russian People&#x27;s Liberation Army). Under Kaminski&#x27;s command, the unit committed numerous war crimes and atrocities in the German-occupied Soviet Union and in Poland. The unit is regarded as one of the most brutal units, with Kaminski himself feared by his subordinates. Kaminski&#x27;s behavior made the Germans lose confidence in him: in August 1944, he was court-martialed and executed. His brigade was later disbanded and its remaining personnel absorbed into General Andrey Vlasov&#x27;s Russian Liberation Army.

==Early life==
Bronislav (also transliterated German-style as &quot;Bronislaw&quot;) Kaminski was born in Vitebsk Governorate, the Russian Empire, now in Polotsk District, Belarus. His father was an ethnic Pole and his mother was an ethnic German (later termed Volksdeutsch in Nazi Germany). He studied at the Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University and then served in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. After demobilization he returned to the institute, and after graduation worked at a chemical plant. In 1935 he was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and in 1937 during the Great Purge he was arrested for criticising Stalin&#x27;s policy of farm collectivisation, as well as working with Germans and Poles. He was accused of &quot;belonging to a counter-revolutionary group&quot;. In 1941 he was released from prison and settled in Bryansk, where he obtained a position as an engineer in the local distillery.

== Lokot Republic leader ==
By October 1941, the German military advance into the Soviet Union reached the area of Lokot near the city of Bryansk, which was captured by German forces on 6 October 1941. In November 1941, Bronislav Kaminski, along with his close friend, a local technical school teacher, Konstantin Voskoboinik, approached the German military administration with a proposal to assist the Germans in establishing a civil administration and local police. Voskoboinik was appointed by the Germans as the Starosta (or Mayor) of the &quot;Lokot volost&quot; and the head of the German-controlled local militia. Kaminski became Voskoboinik&#x27;s deputy; working with Heinz Guderian the two collaborators organized a militia of 10,000 armed men with the aim of crushing the Russian partisans. After the death in combat of Voskoboinik on 8 January 1942, Kaminski took over as Mayor and leader of the militia. In 1942 the militia was named Russian Liberation National Army (RONA) (rus. Русская Освободительная Народная Армия), which reached a force of tens of thousands. During this time Kaminski was leader of the Lokot Republic, which had half a million inhabitants.

In mid March 1942, Kaminski&#x27;s representative at the German Second Panzer Army at Orel assured the commanders that Kaminski&#x27;s unit was &quot;ready to actively fight the guerrillas&quot; as well as to carry on a propaganda campaign against &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot; and Soviet partisans. Soon after the commander of the 2nd Army Generaloberst Rudolf Schmidt, appointed Kaminski Major of the Army Rear Area 532, around Lokot. On 19 July 1942, after approval by the Commander of Army Group Centre, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, Schmidt and the 532 Area commander, Kaminski received a degree of autonomy and nominal self-governing authority, under the supervision of Major von Veltheim and Colonel Rübsam. Kaminski was appointed the Chief Mayor of the republic of Lokot, and brigade commander of the local militia. He administered local government and established his own courts, jails and newspaper. Private enterprise was encouraged and collective farming abolished.

From June 1942, Kaminski&#x27;s militia took part in an action, &quot;Operation Vogelsang&quot;, as a part of General Werner von Gilsa&#x27;s Kampfgruppe (taskforce) Gilsa II. In autumn 1942, Kaminski ordered a compulsory draft into the militia of able-bodied men in the area. Units were also reinforced with &quot;volunteers&quot; drafted from Soviet POWs at nearby Nazi concentration camps. Kaminski ordered the collection of abandoned (usually because of minor mechanical failures, or lack of fuel) Soviet tanks and armored cars. By November 1942, his unit was in possession of at least two BT-7 tanks and one 76 mm artillery piece. Owing to a lack of military uniform and boots, the Germans provided Kaminski&#x27;s brigade with enough used uniforms to outfit four battalions. By late 1942, the militia of the Lokot Republic had expanded to the size of a 14-battalion brigade, of around 8,000 men under arms. By January 1943 the brigade had 9,828 men, including an armored unit with one KV-2 heavy tank, two T-34 medium tanks, three BT-7s, two BT-5 light tanks and three armoured cars (one BA-10, two BA-20).

The brigade was reorganized in the spring of 1943. After the reorganization, the brigade consisted of 5 regiments with 3 battalions each, an anti-aircraft battalion (3 AA guns and 4 heavy machine guns) and an armored unit. A separate &quot;guard&quot; battalion was also created, bringing the total brigade strength up to an estimated 12,000 men.

The brigade took part, with German units, in the May–June 1943 Operation Zigeunerbaron (&quot;Gypsy Baron&quot;). Following this operation, the brigade was part of Operation Citadel, the offensive to destroy the Kursk salient. This operation was followed by similar operations, Freischütz and Tannhäuser, where the brigade, together with other units under German command, was involved in action against partisans and also took part in reprisal operations against the civilian population.

In the summer of 1943, the brigade began to suffer many desertions, due in part to the recent Soviet victories, but also due in part to the efforts of the partisans to &quot;turn&quot; as many of Kaminski&#x27;s troops as possible. As a part of these efforts, there were several attempts on Kaminski&#x27;s life. Each time, Kaminski narrowly avoided death and any captured conspirators were punished by execution. Several German officers passing through Lokot reported seeing bodies hanging from gallows outside Kaminski&#x27;s headquarters. Fearing a breakdown in command, a German liaison staff was attached to Kaminski&#x27;s HQ to restructure the brigade and return stability to the unit. According to post-war Soviet estimates, up to 10,000 civilians were killed during the existence of the Kaminski formation in Lokot.

==In Belarus==
After the failure of the German Operation Citadel, Soviet counter offensives forced the brigade to retreat. On 29 July 1943 Kaminski issued orders for the evacuation of the property and families of the RONA brigade and the Lokot authorities. Up to 30 thousand persons (10-11 thousand of them were brigade members) were transferred by the Germans to the Lepel area of Vitebsk in Belarus by the end of August 1943. The brigade, together with &quot;evacuated&quot; civilians, finally settled in the Lepel area of Vitebsk. This area had active partisans, and the brigade was involved in heavy combat for the rest of the year.

During the retreat, desertions from the brigade increased greatly, and the entire formation seemed close to disintegration. When the commander of the Second Regiment, Major Tarasov, decided to join the Soviet partisans with all his regiment (he was offered amnesty if his entire regiment joined the partisans), Kaminski flew to his headquarters and according to one account, strangled him and eight others in front of his men. Despite this, up to 200 people deserted within the following two days. By the beginning of October 1943, the brigade had lost two thirds of its personnel, while still in possession of 12 tanks (8 of them T-34s), one 122 mm, three 76 mm and eight 45 mm artillery pieces.

At the end of 1943, after German withdrawal from Russia to Belarus, local Belarus police, Soviet prisoners of war and convicts freed from prison were incorporated into the brigade. The force became part of the Waffen-SS and was formed as Stormtroopers Brigade &quot;Kaminski&quot;. On 27 January 1944, Himmler rewarded Kaminski&#x27;s &quot;achievements&quot; by decorating him with the Iron Cross, 2nd Class, and on the same day with the Iron Cross, 1st Class.

On 15 February 1944, Kaminski issued an order for the brigade and Lokot administration to retreat further west to the Dzyatlava area in western Belarus. At this point, the brigade&#x27;s ranks were replenished by the addition of police forces from Belarus. In March 1944, the brigade was renamed Volksheer-Brigade &quot;Kaminski&quot;. From 11 April 1944, it was attached to SS-Kampfgruppe von Gottberg, which also included the notorious Dirlewanger unit, and participated in a mass murder and security operations: Regenschauer (up to 7,000 &quot;bandits&quot; reported as killed), Frühlingsfest (7,011 &quot;bandits&quot; reported as killed and 1,065 weapons captured) and Kormoran (7,697 &quot;bandits&quot; reported as killed and 325 weapons captured). During these operations, local civilians were murdered as &quot;suspected partisans&quot; or deported as slave laborers, their villages burnt down.

==In the SS==
In June 1944, the brigade was absorbed as a part of the Waffen-SS and renamed Waffen-Sturm-Brigade RONA, with Kaminski being given the rank of &quot;Waffen-Brigadeführer der SS&quot;, the only man with such rank.

As the result of Operation Bagration, the anti-partisan activities of the brigade were halted and its personnel (6–7,000 people, though some sources state 3–4,000) were collected at the SS training camp Neuhammer. Plans were made for a non-German SS Division, and the structure was laid down for the 29.Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS (russische Nr.1). On 1 August 1944 Kaminski received a new rank - Waffen-Brigadeführer and Major-General of the Waffen-SS.

==Warsaw Uprising==
In 1944 Kaminski took part in the crushing of the Warsaw Uprising, in the Ochota area, where the Kaminski Brigade committed numerous atrocities (murder, rape and robbery). His troops committed almost 700 murders though numbering only 1% of German forces at the time of the Warsaw uprising. Kaminski thought himself to have direct authority from the SS commander Heinrich Himmler and he did not want to accept orders from SS General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, who was in charge of German forces in Warsaw.

The Warsaw Uprising began 1 August 1944. On 4 August 1944, a combat-ready regiment of the brigade was ordered to assist in crushing the rebellion. SS-Gruppenführer Heinz Reinefarth was placed in charge of Kampfgruppe Reinefarth, a pacification unit which consisted of the Kaminski along with the Dirlewanger and several other Ordnungspolizei and SS rear area units. Hitler personally requested Kaminski&#x27;s assistance, and the latter obliged by gathering a task force of 1,700 unmarried men and sending them (some sources mentioned that they had four T-34 tanks, one SU-76 and a few artillery pieces) to Warsaw as a mixed regiment under field command of Kaminski&#x27;s brigade chief-of-staff, SS-Sturmbannführer Yuri Frolov. Later in 1945 Frolov stated that the regiment had up to 1,600 men and 7 artillery pieces and 4 mortars.

Frolov noted in 1944 that Kaminski gave his men permission to loot and many did. Kaminski&#x27;s brigade soon lost any combat worthiness and Kaminski focused entirely on collecting valuables stolen from civilian homes. Perhaps 10,000 residents of Warsaw were killed in the Ochota massacre, most murdered by Kaminski&#x27;s men.

==Death==
Heinrich Himmler used the misconduct of the Warsaw group as a pretext for having Kaminski and his leadership executed after trial by court martial in Litzmannstadt (Łódź). They were tried for stealing the &quot;property of the Reich&quot;, as the stolen property was to have been delivered to Himmler, but Kaminski and his men had attempted to keep it for themselves. Also executed with Kaminski was his brigade chief-of-staff Waffen-Obersturmbannführer Ilya Shavykin, his driver, and his brigade surgeon, F.N. Zabora, and his translator, G. Sadovsky.

The men of the brigade were given the false explanation that Kaminski had been killed by Polish partisans. When Kaminski&#x27;s men rejected this explanation, the Gestapo took Kaminski&#x27;s car, pushed it into a ditch, shot it up with a machine gun, and smeared goose blood all over it, as evidence. The demoralized unit was soon moved out of town and stationed to the north, far from any partisan activity.

The death of Kaminski and the unreliability of his troops as a combat unit brought the plans to expand the Kaminski Brigade to a division to an end. After Kaminski&#x27;s death, his unit was placed under the command of SS-Brigadeführer and Generalmajor der Polizei Christoph Diehm.

<text>Johann Georg Wagler (28 March 1800 – 23 August 1832) was a German herpetologist and ornithologist.

Wagler was assistant to Johann Baptist von Spix, and gave lectures in zoology at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich after it was moved to Munich. He worked on the extensive collections brought back from Brazil by Spix, and published partly together with him books on reptiles from Brazil. Wagler wrote &quot;Monographia Psittacorum&quot; (1832), which included the correct naming of the blue macaws.

In 1832, Wagler died of an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound while out collecting in München-Moosach.

==Life==
Johann Georg Wagler was a German naturalist and scientist in the 19th century, whose works primarily focused on herpetology and ornithology (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011). Johan Georg Wagler was born on 28 March 1800, in the city of Nuremberg, where the Chancellor of the City Court was Wagler&#x27;s father (Wagler, 1884). After taking up gymnastics at Nuremberg, Johann Georg Wagler began to show a unique predilection for Natural History. Johann Georg Wagler started his scientific research at the University of Erlangen in 1818. After Johann Baptist von Spix returned from his expedition to Brazil in 1819, Johann Georg Wagler, nineteen years of age at the time, was invited become Spix&#x27;s assistant at the Museum of Academy of Sciences in Munich. Johann Georg Wagler later became one of Spix&#x27;s colleagues (Wagler, 1884). In 1820 Johann Georg Wagler obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Leipsic (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011). In 1825, after being Spix&#x27;s assistant in a large number of his zoological works, Johann Georg Wagler was tasked by King Maximillian-Joseph on a special trip to visit the museums of Holland, England, and France (Wagler, 1884).

During this mission across Europe, Johann Georg Wagler was not only made the personal acquaintance of some of the most decorated naturalists and scientists of these nations at the time but also succeeded in acquiring a significant quantity of valuable specimens for the Museum and Menagerie of Munich (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011). Upon Johann Baptist von Spix&#x27;s death in 1826, Johann Georg Wagler became the Director of the Zoological Museum and Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, where Wagler continued working on Spix&#x27;s extensive Brazilian collection from years prior (Beolens, B., Watkins, M., &amp; Grayson, M, 2011). In 1827 Wagler was appointed Professor Extraordinary in the then newly instituted University of Munich (Wagler, 1884). In 1832, Johann Georg Wagler was unfortunately injured from a self-inflicted gunshot on a hunting trip, an incident that led directly to his demise (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011). During his short life span of only thirty-two years, Wagler managed to become a valuable member of the science community with many great and important contributions and discoveries.

==Works==
During his time, Johann Georg Wagler specialised mostly in the fields of herpetology and ornithology. Ornithology is a branch of zoology that specialises in the “methodological study and consequent knowledge of birds with all that relates to them.&quot;(Newton &amp; Gadow, 1986). There are several aspects of ornithology that stem from the related disciplines because of the high level of visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds (Newton, 1998). Herpetology, on the other hand, is a branch within zoology that concerns the research and study of amphibians and reptiles (Zug, Vitt &amp; Caldwell, 2001). From his research and discoveries, Johann Georg Wagler had written and co-written multiple papers on herpetology and ornithology, of which the most famous was a book regarding ornithology named Monographia Psittacorum. Johann Georg Wagler&#x27;s other books, articles and research papers are currently available for viewing at the Biodiversity Heritage Library (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011). Given his short life span, Johann Georg Wagler did not get many chances to publish, however, in 1884, a memoir of Johann Georg Wagler, Wagler&#x27;s Six ornithological memoirs from the “Isis”, was edited and published (Wagler, 1884). The memoirs contained unfinished and unpublished works of Johann Georg Wagler, along with personal details of his expeditions throughout the years (Wagler, 1884).

==Legacy==
Wagler is commemorated in the specific names of three species of reptiles: &quot;Atractus wagleri&quot;, &quot;Podarcis waglerianus&quot;, and &quot;Tropidolaemus wagleri&quot;.

Wagler described a taxonomic arrangement of psittacine fauna, parrots and cockatoos, some of which are recognised in the systematic classification of these birds.

==Awards==
Despite the works and contributions in the fields of herpetology and ornithology made during his career (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011), Johann Georg Wagler did not receive any awards. His legacy and discoveries in the fields of ornithology and herpetology, however, have received appraisals from fellow scientists. Johann Georg Wagler&#x27;s works have stood the test of time and continue to be used and referenced today for scientific research (Kieckbusch, Mader, Kaiser &amp; Mecke, 2018).

==Contributions==
Johann Georg Wagler had made some important and valuable discoveries in the fields of herpetology and ornithology, which contributed greatly to the study of those fields in particular and to the science community as a whole (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011; Wagler, 1884). Johann Georg Wagler has been honoured and celebrated in the specific names of three species of reptiles and eight species of birds (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011). Some of the prominent names include Pteroglossus beauharnaesii Wagler 1832 (Wright, 2015; David, Wright, Elliot &amp; Costa, 2020; Costa, Pacheco &amp; Silveira, 2017), Cylindrophis Wagler 1828 (Kieckbusch, Mader, Kaiser &amp; Mecke, 2018), Blanus Wagler 1830, Altractus Wagleri, Podacris Waglerianus and Tropidolaemus Wagleri (Beolens, Watkins &amp; Grayson, 2011). Johann Georg Wagler had also made a contribution in describing the taxonomic arrangement of psittacine fauna, parrots and cockatoos, some of which are established in the systematic classification of these birds (Wagler, 1832). Johann Georg Wagler&#x27;s contributions to the scientific community in general, ornithology and herpetology in particular, have withstood the test of time for more than one hundred years. Johann Georg Wagler&#x27;s works are used nowadays as the foundation for new discoveries, research and experiments in the fields of ornithology and herpetology (Kieckbusch, Mader, Kaiser &amp; Mecke, 2018).

More recently, Wagler&#x27;s discoveries and works have helped scientists to categorise and research some newfound species from the Iberian Peninsula (Ceríaco &amp; Bauer, 2018). Scientists have also recently found a new species of snake in Indonesia that shared similarities with that of Wagler&#x27;s discovery in the 1800s, the fossorial snake genus Cylindrophis Wagler 1828 (Kieckbusch, Mader, Kaiser &amp; Mecke, 2018). The fossorial snake genus Cylindrophis Wagler, 1828 currently includes 13 species and is common and widely distributed in tropical Asia. There is evidence of existence in Sri Lanka (one species), mainland Southeast Asia including south-eastern China (three species), and the Malay Archipelago (ten species). All species in the genus seem viviparous and share a myriad of morphological characteristics, such as the lack of true gastrosteges, the presence of pelvic spurs, an extremely short tail with conspicuous coloration, and contrasting light and dark ventral blotches. Since the new species was recognised as Cylindrophis melanotus, it is important to discuss the taxonomic history of C. melanotus. The name C. melanotus was first created by Johann Georg Wagler in his Observationes along with the description of C. resplendens (synonym of C. ruffus).

The name showed up in its ablative form as “Cylindrophe melanoto.” While at the time of discovery, a specimen was available to Johann Georg Wagler in the collection of the “Museo Lugdunensi Bat[avorum]” (now RMNH), Wagler also referred to a figure of “Tortricis melanoti” by Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt (1773–1854), which was likely part of Heinrich Boie&#x27;s (1794–1827) unpublished manuscript Erpétologie de Java. The nominative form “Cylindrophis melanotus” (nomen corrigendum) was instead listed by Wagler (1830) in an account for the genus Cylindrophis. Two further species, currently in synonymy with Cylindrophis melanotus, were described in the early 20th Century, C. celebensis Smith, 1927 from Sulawesi and C. heinrichi Ahl, 1933 from the Moluccan island of Halmahera. Johann Georg Wagler described his new species as possessing a light snout with dark mottling.

In 2008, a study was conducted to determine the important impacts for the nomenclature of Kinglet Calyptura Calyptura cristata as well as of its distribution (Stopiglia, Straker &amp; Raposo, 2008). The work of Johann Georg Wagler was used to analyse the findings. A specimen (ZMB 2306) of Kinglet Calyptura Calyptura cristata retrieved in São Paulo by Friedrich Sellow (1789–1831) and Ignaz Franz J. M. von Olfers (1793–1872) was rediscovered in the ornithological collection of the Museum für Naturkunde (ZMB) in Berlin in 2007. Specimen ZMB 2306 has two labels: a label in red inscribed ‘Pipra tyrannulus Wagler and a green label from the original mount that identifies the specimen as Pipra (R.) tyrannulus. In relation to the species of Pipra tyrannulus Wagler, 1830, it appears that Wagler (1830) worked on a revision of the genus Pipra and proposed a new combination for ‘Regulus tyrannulus Lichtenstein’.

The name tyrannulus has been interpreted in two different ways throughout the course of history. Sclater considered Pipra tyrannulus Wagler, 1830, as a synonym of Calyptura cristata, whereas Hellmayr claimed Pipra tyrannulus Wagler, 1830, to be a new name for Pardalotus cristatus Vieillot, 1818. Breaking down the specimen and history, it is obvious that Wagler (1830) was first to publish the name tyrannulus. Although Johann Georg Wagler never claimed to be the author of the specific name, in accordance with the terms of the Code (ICZN 1999) he is, nevertheless, its author. Wagler never brought up tyrannulus as being a new name for cristatus. He instead mentioned Pardalotus cristatus as a synonym of Pipra tyrannulus.

Some of Johann Georg Wagler&#x27;s works in the 1800s remains an interesting topic of discussion today among scientists within the fields of ontology and herpetology. The Curl-crested Aracari Pteroglossus beauharnaesii Wagler, 1832 is one of the most scientifically significant species in the family Ramphastidae (Costa, Pacheco &amp; Silveira, 2017). Among its distinctive characteristics, its modified curly, shiny black crown feathers are one-of-a-kind in the family and are altered to an extent not similar in any other living bird species. The crown feathers, accompanied with the distinctive white throat, were considered enough in the past to include the species in the monotypic genus Beauharnaisius Bonaparte; nevertheless, molecular research have pointed out that it is embedded within the genus Pteroglossus Illiger, sister to P. bitorquatus. It is a southern Amazonian species, showing up around the lowlands area of northern Peru, north and central Bolivia and western and central Amazonian Brazil. The correct publication date of the species’ description and the species’ epithet spelling have been matter of a recent controversy.

Some argued that Pteroglossus beauharnaesii, treated in scientific literature as originally published by Johann Georg Wagler in Isis in 1832, was published earlier as Pteroglossus beauharnaisii by Wagler in 2831 in a daily Munich newspaper, Das Ausland, on 28 April 1831. Hence, beauharnaesii might be regarded as an incorrect subsequent spelling of beauharnaisii. However, others go against that reasoning, claiming that regardless being either an incorrect subsequent spelling of Pteroglossus beauharnaisii Wagler, 1831, or a universally used junior synonym, the name Pteroglossus beauharnaesii Wagler, 1832 need to be preserved as the valid name for the species according to Articles 23.9 and 33.3.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (1999). Pteroglossus beauharnaesii was described by Wagler in honor of Prince August Karl Eugen Napoleon Beauharnais (1810–1835), Duke of Leuchtenberg.

In the original description, Johann Georg Wagler presented the type locality only as “Brasilia, prov. Pará”; and in Wagler&#x27;s earlier work in 1831, he mentioned that Pteroglossus beauharnaesii was “collected in Pará” (“bei Para erlegten”), or “in vicinity of Para”. The holotype&#x27;s label shows only “Pará” as locality. The specimen that Wagler based the description of P. beauharnaesii was possibly obtained by L. Riedel in 1829 on the Rio Madeira, and thus the locality presented by Wagler was imprecise, yet also not incorrect. In fact, until 1889 most of the Brazilian Amazon region was occupied by the enormous “Province Grão-Pará&quot;, commonly referred to only as &quot;Pará&quot;. In addition, the type locality given by Wagler possibly indicated the place from where the material collected in Amazonia during the Langsdorff expedition was shipped, the current city of Belém, which was formerly known as “Pará”, capital of the homonymous province.

During the life span of only thirty-two years, Johann Georg Wagler had managed to bring forth many important contributions and discoveries to the scientific community that stands valid and uncontested until nowadays.

<text>A greave (from the Old French &quot;greve&quot; &quot;shin, shin armor&quot;) or jambeau is a piece of armor that protects the leg.

==Description==
The primary purpose of greaves is to protect the tibia from attack. The tibia, or shinbone, is very close to the skin, and is therefore extremely vulnerable to just about any kind of attack. Furthermore, a successful attack on the shin results in that leg being rendered useless, greatly hampering one&#x27;s ability to maneuver in any way. Greaves were used to counteract this. They usually consisted of a metal exterior with an inner padding of felt. The felt padding was particularly important because, without it, any blow would transfer directly from the metal plating to the shin.

==History==

===Bronze Age===
Bronze greaves were used in Bronze Age Europe by the Mycenaean Greeks and the Central European Urnfield culture, among others.

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The reference to greaves (Ancient Greek: κνημίδες) exists in various texts of classical antiquity, including &quot;The Shield of Heracles&quot;, &quot;The Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, &quot;The Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus&quot;, and &quot;The Aeneid&quot;. In the &quot;Illiad&quot;, the Greek forces are commonly referred to as &quot;well-greaved Acheans&quot; (&quot;euknēmidas Achaioi&quot;, ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοί). The Iliad also mention the ἐπισφύρια which were either plates covering the ankle , attached to the lower edge of the greaves , or more probably a clasp fastening them round the ankle and were often silver.
While these are primarily mythological texts, they still dealt with warfare and the fact that greaves were mentioned is evidence that they were indeed in use. There are also non-fictional testimonies of their use among Roman light infantry (or hastati) from Polybius up to Vegetius. These greaves are thought to have been mass-produced by the Romans using presses on sheets of metal and then attaching lining, usually leather or cloth. While it is generally assumed that greaves were always worn in pairs, there is evidence that many wore just a single greave on the left or right leg. Many skeletons have been found buried with only a single greave, including gladiators and soldiers. People may have worn a single greave as a sign of status, as opposed to any practical use.

===Medieval Europe===
Greaves were common until around the 9th century AD, when they largely disappeared from use. The first evidence of their reappearance is in the 1230s or 1250s, most notably the depiction of Goliath in the Trinity College Apocalypse manuscript (c. 1230). The lack of other evidence suggests that they were uncommon at the time. Almost all greaves used at this time are known as schynbalds, or greaves that only protected the shin. Illustrations showing “closed greaves”, or greaves that protected the entire leg first appear around 1290 and become popular in the 1320s. Closed greaves are made of two plates joined on the outside by hinges and fastening with buckles and straps on the inside.

===Feudal Japan===
Japanese greaves, known as suneate, were first introduced during the eleventh century, during the late Heian period. The earliest form consisted of three plates of metal covering the shin. By the Kamakura period (1186–1333), greaves became a standard part of Japanese armor. Around the Muromachi period (1334–1572), these took on the form of a splint mounted on a piece of fabric with mail in between the metal splint and fabric, not unlike European greaves. This is the most common form of suneate, termed shino-suneate, and saw continued use throughout the Momoyama period (1573–1602). Sometimes, cavalrymen used the older three-plate model, known as tsutsu-suneate. Like their European counterparts, most suneate contain leather padding on the interior to reduce the impact of blows and to reduce chafing.

<text>In mathematics, an asymptotic expansion, asymptotic series or Poincaré expansion (after Henri Poincaré) is a formal series of functions which has the property that truncating the series after a finite number of terms provides an approximation to a given function as the argument of the function tends towards a particular, often infinite, point. Investigations by revealed that the divergent part of an asymptotic expansion is latently meaningful, i.e. contains information about the exact value of the expanded function.

The theory of asymptotic series was created by Poincaré (and independently by Stieltjes) in 1886.

The most common type of asymptotic expansion is a power series in either positive or negative powers. Methods of generating such expansions include the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula and integral transforms such as the Laplace and Mellin transforms. Repeated integration by parts will often lead to an asymptotic expansion.

Since a &quot;convergent&quot; Taylor series fits the definition of asymptotic expansion as well, the phrase &quot;asymptotic series&quot; usually implies a &quot;non-convergent&quot; series. Despite non-convergence, the asymptotic expansion is useful when truncated to a finite number of terms. The approximation may provide benefits by being more mathematically tractable than the function being expanded, or by an increase in the speed of computation of the expanded function. Typically, the best approximation is given when the series is truncated at the smallest term. This way of optimally truncating an asymptotic expansion is known as superasymptotics. The error is then typically of the form where is the expansion parameter. The error is thus beyond all orders in the expansion parameter. It is possible to improve on the superasymptotic error, e.g. by employing resummation methods such as Borel resummation to the divergent tail. Such methods are often referred to as hyperasymptotic approximations.

See asymptotic analysis and big O notation for the notation used in this article.

==Formal definition==

First we define an asymptotic scale, and then give the formal definition of an asymptotic expansion.

If formula_1 is a sequence of continuous functions on some domain, and if formula_2 is a limit point of the domain, then the sequence constitutes an asymptotic scale if for every ,

:formula_3 

(formula_2 may be taken to be infinity.) In other words, a sequence of functions is an asymptotic scale if each function in the sequence grows strictly slower (in the limit formula_5) than the preceding function.

If formula_6 is a continuous function on the domain of the asymptotic scale, then has an asymptotic expansion of order formula_7 with respect to the scale as a formal series 

:formula_8 

if

:formula_9

or the weaker condition

:formula_10

is satisfied. Here, formula_11 is the little o notation. If one or the other holds for all formula_7, then we write

:formula_13

In contrast to a convergent series for formula_6, wherein the series converges for any &quot;fixed&quot; formula_15 in the limit formula_16, one can think of the asymptotic series as converging for &quot;fixed&quot; formula_7 in the limit formula_5 (with formula_2 possibly infinite).

==Examples==

* Gamma function (Stirling&#x27;s approximation) formula_20
* Exponential integral formula_21
* Logarithmic integral formula_22
* Riemann zeta function formula_23where formula_24 are Bernoulli numbers and formula_25 is a rising factorial. This expansion is valid for all complex &quot;s&quot; and is often used to compute the zeta function by using a large enough value of &quot;N&quot;, for instance formula_26.
* Error functionformula_27 where is the double factorial.

==Worked example==
Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence. Thus, for example, one may start with the ordinary series

:formula_28

The expression on the left is valid on the entire complex plane formula_29, while the right hand side converges only for formula_30. Multiplying by formula_31 and integrating both sides yields

:formula_32

after the substitution formula_33 on the right hand side. The integral on the left hand side, understood as a Cauchy principal value, can be expressed in terms of the exponential integral. The integral on the right hand side may be recognized as the gamma function. Evaluating both, one obtains the asymptotic expansion

:formula_34

Here, the right hand side is clearly not convergent for any non-zero value of &quot;t&quot;. However, by truncating the series on the right to a finite number of terms, one may obtain a fairly good approximation to the value of formula_35 for sufficiently small &quot;t&quot;. Substituting formula_36 and noting that formula_37 results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article.

=== Integration by parts ===
Using integration by parts, we can obtain an explicit formulaformula_38For any fixed formula_39, the absolute value of the error term formula_40 decreases, then increases. The minimum occurs at formula_41, at which point formula_42. This bound is said to be &quot;asymptotics beyond all orders&quot;.

==Properties==
===Uniqueness for a given asymptotic scale===
For a given asymptotic scale formula_43 the asymptotic expansion of function formula_44 is unique. That is the coefficients formula_45 are uniquely determined in the following way:
formula_46
where formula_47 is the limit point of this asymptotic expansion (may be formula_48).

===Non-uniqueness for a given function===
A given function formula_44 may have many asymptotic expansions (each with a different asymptotic scale).

===Subdominance===
An asymptotic expansion may be an asymptotic expansion to more than one function.

<text>&quot;Les Champs magnétiques &quot; &quot;(The Magnetic Fields)&quot; is a 1920 book by André Breton and Philippe Soupault. It is famous as the first work of literary Surrealism. The authors used a surrealist automatic writing technique.

The book is considered Surrealist, rather than Dadaist, because it attempts to create something new rather than react to an existing work.

&quot;Les Champs magnetiques&quot; is characterised by rich textured language that often seems to border on the nonsensical. This is considered a &quot;normal&quot; result of automatic writing and is considerably more logical than the output from other Surrealist techniques, such as &quot;exquisite corpse&quot; (a method whereby each of a group of collaborators, in sequence, adds words or images to a composition).

A typical paragraph in (a translation of) &quot;Les Champs magnetiques&quot; is:

:&quot;It was the end of sorrow lies. The rail stations were dead, flowing like bees stung from honeysuckle. The people hung back and watched the ocean, animals flew in and out of focus. The time had come. Yet king dogs never grow old – they stay young and fit, and someday they might come to the beach and have a few drinks, a few laughs, and get on with it. But not now. The time had come; we all knew it. But who would go first?&quot;

The division between chapters was the point where the writers stopped writing at the end of the day. The next chapter was started the following morning.

Breton gave many interviews about the creation of the book.

<doc id="642101" wikidata="Q207726" url="?curid=642101" title="Cardioid">
<text>In geometry, a cardioid () is a plane curve traced by a point on the perimeter of a circle that is rolling around a fixed circle of the same radius. It can also be defined as an epicycloid having a single cusp. It is also a type of sinusoidal spiral, and an inverse curve of the parabola with the focus as the center of inversion. A cardioid can also be defined as the set of points of reflections of a fixed point on a circle through all tangents to the circle.

The name was coined by Giovanni Salvemini in 1741 but the cardioid had been the subject of study decades beforehand. Although named for its heart-like form, it is shaped more like the outline of the cross-section of a round apple without the stalk.

A cardioid microphone exhibits an acoustic pickup pattern that, when graphed in two dimensions, resembles a cardioid (any 2d plane containing the 3d straight line of the microphone body). In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone which is the &quot;stalk&quot; of the apple.

== Equations ==

Let formula_1 be the common radius of the two generating circles with midpoints formula_2, formula_3 the rolling angle and the origin the starting point (see picture). One gets the
* parametric representation: formula_4 and herefrom the representation in
* polar coordinates: formula_5
* Introducing the substitutions formula_6 and formula_7 one gets after removing the square root the implicit representation in Cartesian coordinates: formula_8

===Proof for the parametric representation===
A proof can be established using complex numbers and their common description as the complex plane. The rolling movement of the black circle on the blue one can be split into two rotations. In the complex plane a rotation around point formula_9 (the origin) by an angle formula_3 can be performed by multiplying a point formula_11 (complex number) by formula_12. Hence
: the rotation formula_13 around point formula_1 isformula_15,
: the rotation formula_16 around point formula_17 is: formula_18.
A point formula_19 of the cardioid is generated by rotating the origin around point formula_1 and subsequently rotating around formula_17 by the same angle formula_3:
formula_23
From here one gets the parametric representation above:
formula_24
(The trigonometric identities formula_25 formula_26 and formula_27 were used.)

== Metric properties ==
For the cardioid as defined above the following formulas hold:
* &quot;area&quot; formula_28,
* &quot;arc length&quot; formula_29 and
* &quot;radius of curvature&quot; formula_30
The proofs of these statements use in both cases the polar representation of the cardioid. For suitable formulas see polar coordinate system (arc length) and polar coordinate system (area)

 \; d\varphi = \cdots = 8a\int_0^\pi\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}(1 - \cos\varphi)}\; d\varphi = 8a\int_0^\pi\sin\left(\tfrac{\varphi}{2}\right) d\varphi = 16a.&lt;/math&gt;


{r(\varphi)^2 + 2 \dot r(\varphi)^2 - r(\varphi) \ddot r(\varphi)} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

For the cardioid formula_31 one gets
formula_32

== Properties ==
=== Chords through the cusp ===
; C1: &quot;Chords&quot; through the cusp of the cardioid have the same length formula_33.
; C2: The &quot;midpoints&quot; of the chords through the cusp lie on the perimeter of the fixed generator circle (see picture).

==== Proof of C1 ====
The points formula_34 are on a chord through the cusp (=origin). Hence formula_35

==== Proof for C2 ====
For the proof the representation in the complex plane (see above) is used. For the points formula_36 and formula_37

the midpoint of the chord formula_38 is formula_39 which lies on the perimeter of the circle with midpoint formula_17 and radius formula_1 (see picture).

=== Cardioid as inverse curve of a parabola ===
: A cardioid is the inverse curve of a parabola with its focus at the center of inversion (see graph)

For the example shown in the graph the generator circles have radius formula_42. Hence the cardioid has the polar representation
formula_43
and its inverse curve
formula_44
which is a parabola (s. parabola in polar coordinates) with the equation formula_45 in Cartesian coordinates.

&quot;Remark: &quot;Not every inverse curve of a parabola is a cardioid. For example, if a parabola is inverted across a circle whose center lies at the &quot;vertex&quot; of the parabola, then the result is a cissoid of Diocles.

=== Cardioid as envelope of a pencil of circles ===

In the previous section if one inverts additionally the tangents of the parabola one gets a pencil of circles through the center of inversion (origin). A detailed consideration shows: The midpoints of the circles lie on the perimeter of the fixed generator circle. (The generator circle is the inverse curve of the parabola&#x27;s directrix.)

This property gives rise to the following simple method to &quot;draw&quot; a cardioid:
# Choose a circle formula_46 and a point formula_47 on its perimeter,
# draw circles containing formula_47 with centers on formula_46, and
# draw the envelope of these circles.

=== Cardioid as envelope of a pencil of lines ===

A similar and simple method to draw a cardioid uses a pencil of &quot;lines&quot;. It is due to L. Cremona:

# Draw a circle, divide its perimeter into equal spaced parts with formula_50 points (s. picture) and number them consecutively.
# Draw the chords: formula_51. (That is, the second point is moved by double velocity.)
# The &quot;envelope&quot; of these chords is a cardioid.
==== Proof ====
The following consideration uses trigonometric formulae for formula_52, formula_53, formula_54, formula_55, and formula_56.
In order to keep the calculations simple, the proof is given for the cardioid with polar representation
formula_57 (&quot;§ Cardioids in different positions&quot;).

===== &quot;Equation of the tangent&quot; of the &quot;cardioid&quot; with polar representation =====

From the parametric representation
formula_58

one gets the normal vector formula_59. The equation of the tangent
formula_60 is:
formula_61

With help of trigonometric formulae and subsequent division by formula_62, the equation of the tangent can be rewritten as:
formula_63

===== &quot;Equation of the chord&quot; of the &quot;circle&quot; with midpoint and radius =====
For the equation of the secant line passing the two points formula_64 one gets:
formula_65

With help of trigonometric formulae and the subsequent division by formula_66 the equation of the secant line can be rewritten by:
formula_67

===== Conclusion =====
Despite the two angles formula_68 have different meanings (s. picture) one gets for formula_69 the same line. Hence any secant line of the circle, defined above, is a tangent of the cardioid, too:
: &quot;The cardioid is the envelope of the chords of a circle.&quot;

&quot;Remark:&quot;
The proof can be performed with help of the &quot;envelope conditions&quot; (see previous section) of an implicit pencil of curves:
formula_70

is the pencil of secant lines of a circle (s. above) and
formula_71

For fixed parameter t both the equations represent lines. Their intersection point is
formula_72

which is a point of the cardioid with polar equation formula_73


=== Cardioid as caustic of a circle ===
The considerations made in the previous section give a proof that the caustic of a circle with light source on the perimeter of the circle is a cardioid.
: If in the plane there is a light source at a point formula_74 on the perimeter of a circle which is reflecting any ray, then the reflected rays within the circle are tangents of a cardioid.

 \varphi, \sin{\color{red}\tfrac{3}{2}} \varphi\right)^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt; (see graph) and contains point formula_75. The reflected ray is part of the line with equation (see previous section)
formula_76
which is tangent of the cardioid with polar equation
formula_77
from the previous section.}}

&quot;Remark:&quot; For such considerations usually multiple reflections at the circle are neglected.

=== Cardioid as pedal curve of a circle ===

The Cremona generation of a cardioid should not be confused with the following generation:

Let be formula_78 a circle and formula_47 a point on the perimeter of this circle. The following is true:
: The foots of perpendiculars from point formula_47 on the tangents of circle formula_78 are points of a cardioid.

Hence a cardioid is a special pedal curve of a circle.

==== Proof ====
In a Cartesian coordinate system circle formula_78 may have midpoint formula_83 and radius formula_84. The tangent at circle point formula_85 has the equation
formula_86
The foot of the perpendicular from point formula_47 on the tangent is point formula_88 with the still unknown distance formula_89 to the origin formula_47. Inserting the point into the equation of the tangent yields
formula_91
which is the polar equation of a cardioid.

&quot;Remark:&quot; If point formula_47 is not on the perimeter of the circle formula_78, one gets a limaçon of Pascal.

== The evolute of a cardioid ==

The evolute of a curve is the locus of centers of curvature. In detail: For a curve formula_94 with radius of curvature formula_95 the evolute has the representation
formula_96
with formula_97 the suitably oriented unit normal.

For a cardioid one gets:
: The &quot;evolute&quot; of a cardioid is another cardioid, one third as large, and facing the opposite direction (s. picture).

=== Proof ===
For the cardioid with parametric representation
formula_98
formula_99
the unit normal is
formula_100
and the radius of curvature
formula_101
Hence the parametric equations of the evolute are
formula_102
formula_103
These equations describe a cardioid a third as large, rotated 180 degrees and shifted along the x-axis by formula_104.

(Trigonometric formulae were used: formula_105)

== Orthogonal trajectories ==

An orthogonal trajectory of a pencil of curves is a curve which intersects any curve of the pencil orthogonally. For cardioids the following is true:

(The second pencil can be considered as reflections at the y-axis of the first one. See diagram.)

=== Proof ===
For a curve given in polar coordinates by a function formula_106 the following connection to Cartesian coordinates hold:
formula_107

and for the derivatives
formula_108

Dividing the second equation by the first yields the Cartesian slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point formula_109:
formula_110

For the cardioids with the equations formula_111 and formula_112 respectively one gets:
formula_113 and formula_114

(The slope of any curve depends on formula_3 only, and not on the parameters formula_1 or formula_117!)

Hence
formula_118
That means: Any curve of the first pencil intersects any curve of the second pencil orthogonally.

== In different positions ==
Choosing other positions of the cardioid within the coordinate system results in different equations. The picture shows the 4 most common positions of a cardioid and their polar equations.

== In complex analysis ==

In complex analysis, the image of any circle through the origin under the map formula_119 is a cardioid. One application of this result is that the boundary of the central period-1 component of the Mandelbrot set is a cardioid given by the equation
formula_120

The Mandelbrot set contains an infinite number of slightly distorted copies of itself and the central bulb of any of these smaller copies is an approximate cardioid.

== Caustics ==
Certain caustics can take the shape of cardioids. The catacaustic of a circle with respect to a point on the circumference is a cardioid. Also, the catacaustic of a cone with respect to rays parallel to a generating line is a surface whose cross section is a cardioid. This can be seen, as in the photograph to the right, in a conical cup partially filled with liquid when a light is shining from a distance and at an angle equal to the angle of the cone. The shape of the curve at the bottom of a cylindrical cup is half of a nephroid, which looks quite similar.

<doc id="642105" wikidata="Q696937" url="?curid=642105" title="Timeshare">
<text>A timeshare (sometimes called a vacation ownership or vacation club) is a property with a divided form of ownership or use rights. These properties are typically resort condominium units, in which multiple parties hold rights to use the property, and each owner of the same accommodation is allotted their period of time. Units may be sold as a partial ownership, lease, or &quot;right to use&quot;, in which case the latter holds no claim to ownership of the property. The ownership of timeshare programs is varied, and has been changing over the decades.

== History ==
The term &quot;timeshare&quot; was coined in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s, expanding on a vacation system that became popular after World War II. Vacation home sharing, also known as holiday home sharing, involved four European families that would purchase a vacation cottage jointly, each having exclusive use of the property for one of the four seasons. They rotated seasons each year, so each family enjoyed the prime seasons equally. This concept was mostly used by related families because joint ownership requires trust and no property manager was involved. However, not many families vacation for an entire season at a time; so the vacation home sharing properties were often vacant for long periods.

British businesses decided to go one step further and divide a resort room into 1/50th ownership, have two weeks each year for repairs and upgrades, and charge a maintenance fee to each owner. It took almost a decade for timeshares in Europe to evolve into a smoothly run, successful business venture.

The first timeshare in the United States was started in 1974 by Caribbean International Corporation (CIC), based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It offered what it called a 25-year &quot;vacation license&quot; rather than ownership. The company owned two resorts the &quot;vacation license holder&quot; could alternate their vacation weeks with: one in St. Croix and one in St. Thomas; both in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands properties began their timeshare sales in 1973.

The contract was simple and straightforward: The company, CIC, promised to maintain and provide the specified accommodation type (a studio, one bedroom, or two bedroom unit) for use by the &quot;license owner&quot; for a period of 25 years (from 1974 to 1999, for example) in the specified season and number of weeks agreed upon, with only two extra charges: a $15.00 per diem (per night) rate, frozen at that cost for the life of the contract, and a $25.00 switching fee, should the licensee decide to use their time at one of the other resorts. The contract was based on the fact that the cost of the license, and the small per diem, compared with the projected increase in the cost of hotel rates over 25 years to over $100.00 per night, would save the license owner many vacation dollars over the span of the license agreement. Between 1974 and 1999, in the United States, inflation boosted the current cost of the per diem to $52.00, validating the cost savings assumption. The license owner was allowed to rent, or give their week away as a gift in any particular year. The only stipulation was that the $15.00 per diem must be paid every year whether the unit was occupied or not. This &quot;must be paid yearly fee&quot; would become the roots of what is known today as &quot;maintenance fees&quot;, once the Florida Department of Real Estate became involved in regulating timeshares.

The timeshare concept in the United States caught the eye of many entrepreneurs due to the enormous profits to be made by selling the same room 52 times to 52 different owners at an average price in 1974–1976 of $3,500.00 per week. Shortly thereafter, the Florida Real Estate Commission stepped in, enacting legislation to regulate Florida timeshares, and make them fee simple ownership transactions. This meant that in addition to the price of the owner&#x27;s vacation week, a maintenance fee and a homeowners association had to be initiated. This fee simple ownership also spawned timeshare location exchange companies, such as Interval International and RCI, so owners in any given area could exchange their week with owners in other areas.

Cancellations, or rescission, of the timeshare contract, remain the industry&#x27;s biggest problems to date; the difficulty has been the subject of comedy in popular entertainment.

== Legislation ==
The industry is regulated in all countries where resorts are located. In Europe, it is regulated by European and by national legislation. In 1994, the European Communities adopted &quot;The European Directive 94/47/EC of the European Parliament and Council on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis&quot;, which was subject to recent review, and resulted in the adoption on January 14, 2009, on European Directive 2008/122/EC.

=== Established regulations in Mexico ===

On May 17, 2010, Mexico’s Ministry of Economy through the General Directorate of Standards established new regulations and requirements for developers of timeshare services. The new regulations are outlined in the Official Mexican Norm (NOM), which consists of a series of official standards and regulations applicable to diverse activities in Mexico. The following institutions were involved during the new standardization:
* Mexican Resort Development Association (AMDETUR)
* National Fund for Tourism Development (FONATUR)
* Federal Consumer Protection Office (PROFECO)
* Ministry of Economy (SE)
* Secretary of Tourism (SECTUR)

NOM is officially called: &quot;NOM-029-SCFI-2010, Commercial Practices and Information Requirements for the Rendering of Timeshare Service&quot;. It established the following standards:
* Marketing companies are not allowed to offer gifts and solicit for prospective timeshare owners without clearly specifying the real purpose of the offer.
* The requirements to cancel a timeshare contract must be more practical and less burdensome.
* NOM recognizes the privacy rights of timeshare consumers. It is strictly prohibited for the timeshare provider to dispose of the consumer&#x27;s personal information without written consent.
* Verbal promises must be written and established in the original timeshare contract.
* The timeshare provider must comply with all obligations written in the timeshare contract, as well as the internal rules of the timeshare resort.
* The charges that are intended to be made to the consumer must be plainly and clearly defined on the timeshare application forms, including the membership cost, and all extra fees (maintenance fees/exchange club fees).

To make the new regulations applicable to any person or entity that provides timeshares, the definition of a timeshare service provider was substantially extended and clarified. If the timeshare provider does not follow the rules decreed in NOM, the consequences may be substantial, and may include financial penalties that can range from $50 to $200,000.

==Methods of use==
Owners can:

* Use their usage time
* Rent out their owned usage
* Give it as a gift
* Donate it to a charity (should the charity choose to accept the burden of the associated maintenance payments)
* Exchange internally within the same resort or resort group
* Exchange externally into thousands of other resorts
* Sell it either through traditional or online advertising, or by using a licensed broker. Timeshare contracts allow transfer through sale, but it is rarely accomplished. According to the EU Directive, Long-term holiday ownership products in the EU, which includes timeshare fixed weeks, points and fractional ownerships cannot be sold as resellable assets.

Recently, with most point systems, owners may elect to:

* Assign their usage time to the point system to be exchanged for airline tickets, hotels, travel packages, cruises, amusement park tickets
* Instead of renting all their actual usage time, rent part of their points without actually getting any usage time and use the rest of the points
* Rent more points from either the internal exchange entity or another owner to get a larger unit, more vacation time, or to a better location
* Save or move points from one year to another

Some developers, however, may limit which of these options are available at their respective properties.

Owners can elect to stay at their resort during the prescribed period, which varies depending on the nature of their ownership. In many resorts, they can rent out their week or give it as a gift to friends and family.

=== Exchanging timeshares ===
Used as the basis for attracting mass appeal to purchasing a timeshare, is the idea of owners exchanging their week, either independently or through exchange agencies. The two largest—often mentioned in media—are RCI and Interval International (II), which combined, have over 7,000 resorts. They have resort affiliate programs, and members can only exchange with affiliated resorts. It is most common for a resort to be affiliated with only one of the larger exchange agencies, although resorts with dual affiliations are not uncommon. The timeshare resort one purchases determines which of the exchange companies can be used to make exchanges. RCI and II charge a yearly membership fee, and additional fees for when they find an exchange for a requesting member, and bar members from renting weeks for which they already have exchanged.

Owners can also exchange their weeks or points through independent exchange companies. Owners can exchange without needing the resort to have a formal affiliation agreement with the companies, if the resort of ownership agrees to such arrangements in the original contract.

Due to the promise of exchange, timeshares often sell regardless of the location of their deeded resort. What is not often disclosed is the difference in trading power depending on the location, and season of the ownership. If a resort is in a prime vacation region, it will exchange extremely well depending on the season and week that is assigned to the particular unit trying to make an exchange. However, timeshares in highly desirable locations and high season time slots are the most expensive in the world, subject to demand typical of any heavily trafficked vacation area. An individual who owns a timeshare in the American desert community of Palm Springs, California, in the middle of July or August will possess a much reduced ability to exchange time, because fewer come to a resort at a time when the temperatures are in excess of .

== Varieties ==

===Deeded versus right-to-use contracts===
A major difference in types of vacation ownership is between deeded and right-to-use contracts.

With deeded contracts the use of the resort is usually divided into week-long increments and are sold as real property via fractional ownership. As with any other piece of real estate, the owner may do whatever is desired: use the week, rent it, give it away, leave it to heirs, or sell the week to another prospective buyer. The owner is also liable for an equal portion of the real estate taxes, which usually are collected with condominium maintenance fees. The owner can potentially deduct some property-related expenses, such as real estate taxes from taxable income.

Deeded ownership can be as complex as outright property ownership in that the structure of deeds vary according to local property laws. Leasehold deeds are common and offer ownership for a fixed period of time after which the ownership reverts to the freeholder. Occasionally, leasehold deeds are offered in perpetuity, however many deeds do not convey ownership of the land, but merely the apartment or unit (housing) of the accommodation.

With right-to-use contracts, a purchaser has the right to use the property in accordance with the contract, but at some point the contract ends and all rights revert to the property owner. Thus, a right-to-use contract grants the right to use the resort for a specific number of years. In many countries there are severe limits on foreign property ownership; thus, this is a common method for developing resorts in countries such as Mexico. Care should be taken with this form of ownership as the right to use often takes the form of a &quot;club membership&quot; or the right to use the reservation system, where the reservation system is owned by a company not in the control of the owners. &quot;The right to use may be lost with the demise of the controlling company&quot;, because a right to use purchaser&#x27;s contract is &quot;usually&quot; only good with the current owner, and if that owner sells the property, the lease holder could be out of luck depending on the structure of the contract, and/or &quot;current&quot; laws in foreign venues.

===Fixed-week ownership===
The formerly common unit of sale is a fixed week; the resort will have a calendar enumerating the weeks roughly starting with the first calendar week of the year. An owner may own a deed to use a unit for a single specified week; for example, week 51 typically includes Christmas. An individual who owns Week 26 at a resort can use only that week in each year.

===Floating-week ownership===
Sometimes units are sold as floating weeks, in which a contract specifies the number of weeks held by each owner and from which weeks the owner may select for his stay. An example of this may be a floating summer week, in which the owner may choose any single week during the summer. In such a situation, there is likely to be greater competition during weeks featuring holidays, while lesser competition is likely when schools are still in session. Some floating contracts exclude major holidays so they may be sold as fixed weeks.

===Rotating or flex-week ownership===
Some are sold as rotating weeks, commonly referred to as &quot;flex&quot; weeks. In an attempt to give all owners a chance for the best weeks, the weeks are rotated forward or backward through the calendar, so in year 1 the owner may have use of week 25, then week 26 in year 2, and then week 27 in year 3. This method gives each owner a fair opportunity for prime weeks, but unlike its name, it is not flexible.

===Points programs===
A variant form of real estate-based timeshare that combines features of deeded timeshare with right-to-use offerings was developed by Disney Vacation Club (DVC) in 1991. Purchasers of DVC timeshare interests, whom DVC calls &quot;members&quot; receive a deed conveying an undivided real property interest in a timeshare unit. Each DVC member&#x27;s property interest is accompanied by an annual allotment of &quot;vacation points&quot; in proportion to the size of the property interest. DVC&#x27;s vacation points system is marketed as &quot;highly flexible&quot; and may be used in different increments for vacation stays at DVC resorts in a variety of accommodations from studios to three-bedroom villas. DVC&#x27;s vacation points can be exchanged for vacations worldwide in non-Disney resorts, or may be &quot;banked&quot; into or &quot;borrowed&quot; from future years.

DVC&#x27;s deeded/vacation point structure, which has been used at all of its timeshare resorts, has been adopted by other large timeshare developers including the Hilton Grand Vacations Company, the Marriott Vacation Club, the Holiday Inn Club Vacations, the Hyatt Residence Club and Accor in France.

Resort-based points programs are also sold as deeded and as right to use. Points programs annually give the owner a number of points equal to the level of ownership. The owner in a points program can then use these points to make travel arrangements within the resort group. Many points programs are affiliated with large resort groups offering a large selection of options for destination. Many resort point programs provide flexibility from the traditional week stay. Resort point program members, such as WorldMark by Wyndham and Diamond Resorts International, may request from the entire available inventory of the resort group.

A points program member may often request fractional weeks as well as full or multiple week stays. The number of points required to stay at the resort in question will vary based on a points chart. The points chart will allow for factors such as:
* Popularity of the resort
* Size of the accommodations
* Number of nights
* Desirability of the season

==Types and sizes of accommodations==
Timeshare properties tend to be apartment style accommodations ranging in size from studio units (with room for two), to three and four bedroom units. These larger units can usually accommodate large families comfortably. Units normally include fully equipped kitchens with a dining area, dishwasher, televisions, DVD players, etc. It is not uncommon to have washers and dryers in the unit or accessible on the resort property. The kitchen area and amenities will reflect the size of the particular unit in question.

Units are usually listed by how many the unit will sleep and how many the unit will sleep privately. Traditionally, but not exclusively:
* Sleeps 2/2 would normally be a one bedroom or studio
* Sleeps 6/4 would normally be a two bedroom with a sleeper sofa
Timeshares are sold worldwide, and every venue has its own unique descriptions.

Sleep privately usually refers to the number of guests who will not have to walk through another guest&#x27;s sleeping area to use a restroom. Timeshare resorts tend to be strict on the number of guests permitted per unit.

Unit size affects the cost and demand at any given resort. The same does not hold true comparing resorts in different locations. A one-bedroom unit in a desirable location may still be more expensive and in higher demand than a two-bedroom accommodation in a resort with less demand. An example of this may be a one-bedroom at a desirable beach resort compared to a two-bedroom unit at a resort located inland from the same beach.

==Sales incentives==
Timeshare sales staffs often provide incentives, including free or deeply discounted hotel rooms, tickets, and gifts, for the prospective buyer to take a tour of the property.

===The tour===
The prospective buyers (or &quot;prospects&quot;) are seated in a hospitality room with many tables and chairs to accommodate families. The prospects are assigned a tour guide, who may be a licensed real estate agent. Procedures vary from venue to venue. After a warm-up period and some coffee or snack, a podium speaker welcomes the prospects to the resort, and shows a promotional video.

The prospects are then invited to take a tour of the property. Depending on the resort&#x27;s available inventory, the tour will include an accommodation that the tour guide or agent feels will best fit the prospect&#x27;s family&#x27;s needs. After the tour, the group returns to the hospitality room for a verbal sales presentation. During the presentation, they are handed the resort exchange book from RCI, Interval International, or whatever exchange company is associated with that particular resort property. The prospects are asked about the places they would like to visit if they were timeshare owners. The rest of the presentation is designed around the responses the prospective buyers give to that question.

If the guide is licensed, the prospect is quoted the retail price of the particular unit that best seemed to fit the prospective buyer&#x27;s needs. If the tour guide is not a licensed agent, a licensed agent steps in to present the price. If the prospect replies with &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;I would like to think about it&quot;, the prospect will then be given a new incentive to buy. This incentive will usually be a discounted price that is only &quot;good today&quot; (which is untrue). If again, the reply is &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;I would like to think about it&quot;, the sales agent asks the prospect to please talk to one of the managers before the prospect leaves.

A sales manager, assistant manager or project director may be called to the table for &quot;T.O.&quot;, for &quot;takeover&quot;, to find an incentive, usually in the form of a smaller, less expensive unit, or a traded in unit from another owner. A common T.O. tactic is to claim that a lower price is exclusive to a specific buyer. If one incentive doesn&#x27;t move a prospect to purchase, another will follow shortly, until the prospect has either purchased, convinced the sales crew that they are uninterested, or has left on their own.

===Cancellation of a timeshare contract===
Timeshare sales are often high pressure and fast moving. Some people sign a contract, then want to cancel it shortly thereafter.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission mandates a &quot;cooling-off period&quot; that allows people to cancel some types of purchases without penalty within three days. Additionally, almost all U.S. states have laws that specifically govern cancellation of timeshare contracts. In Florida, a new timeshare owner can cancel the purchase within ten days. The law differs by jurisdiction as to whether out-of-state purchasers are subject to the rescission period of their state of residence, or the rescission period of the state where the timeshare purchase was made.

Another common practice is to have the prospective buyer sign a &quot;cancellation waiver&quot;, using it as an excuse to lower the price of the timeshare in exchange for the buyer waiving cancellation rights (or paying a penalty, such as losing 10% of the purchase price, if the sale is cancelled). However, such a waiver is not legally enforceable anywhere in Mexico or the United States.

There are companies that specialize in timeshare cancellation, although some cancellation companies are suspected of fraud.

== Resale market ==

=== Market value ===
A resale value of a timeshare unit varies between the timeshare systems and properties. While it&#x27;s possible for certain units in certain timeshare systems to appreciate in value over time, this is a rather rare event. Most properties in most timeshare systems are worth a fraction of the original price after the purchase, and often carry no value at all.

Deeds with severe restrictions on resale are typically given out for free. For example, upon resale of most Holiday Inn Club Vacations properties, the new owner can no longer use the allotted point value to make reservations at any HICV resort. They are limited to their home resort only, and booking window is shorter.

Deeds with no resale restrictions may carry some resale value, depending on the location, season, unit size, or the allotted points value. For example, large units in mountain resorts during ski season and large penthouse units in popular destinations will have some resale value. Likewise, small units in destinations saturated by timeshares, or with expensive maintenance fees compared to the value of offered points in their respective system, will have no resale value at all.

==== List of timeshare systems with severe resale restrictions ====

* Holiday Inn Club Vacations (excluding Gatlinburg, Lake Geneva and Myrtle Beach)
* Westgate Resorts (including some HGV-managed deeds at Elara purchased from Westgate)

=== Right of first refusal ===
Most timeshare companies retain the right of first refusal for most of their properties. If that is a case, each owner is required to submit their purchase agreement contract to the developer and ask for a waiver. The developer may decide to exercise ROFR to purchase the subject property, thus refusing the sale to the original buyer. A transaction is typically exempted from ROFR if the purchaser is a direct family member.

Even though resales come at a fraction of original costs, developers are often reluctant to exercise the ROFR. Many sought-after deeds change hands uninterrupted. When a developer exercises the ROFR, they become the owner and must pay the same maintenance fees and property taxes to the resort&#x27;s HOA, so they must maintain a healthy balance between inventory ready for sale and maintenance costs.

* Disney Vacation Club
* Hilton Grand Vacations (excluding HGV at the Flamingo, and all affiliate resorts)
* Marriott Vacation Club

== Criticism ==
The United States Federal Trade Commission provides consumers with information regarding timeshare pricing and other related information. Also known as Universal Lease Programs (ULPs), timeshares are considered to be securities under the law.

Many timeshare owners complain about the annual maintenance fee (which includes property taxes) being too high.

Timeshare developers contend that pricing compared to staying at hotels in the long term is projected to be lower to the timeshare owner. However, a hotel guest does not have a monthly vacation mortgage payment, upfront cost, fixed schedule, maintenance fees, and preset vacation locations. Many owners also complain that the increasing cost of timeshares and accompanying maintenance and exchange fees are rising faster than hotel rates in the same areas.

The industry&#x27;s reputation has been severely injured by the comparison of the timeshare salesman to the used car salesman, because of the sales pressure put on the prospective buyer to &quot;buy today&quot;. &quot;The discounted price I quoted you is only good if you buy today&quot;, is the industry standard&#x27;s pitch to close the sale on the first visit to the resort. Many have left a timeshare tour complaining of being exhausted by the barrage of salespeople they had to deal with before they finally exited the tour. The term &quot;TO&quot;, or &quot;turn over&quot; man, was coined in the land industry, and quickly evolved to the timeshare industry. Once the original tour guide or salesman gives the prospective buyer the pitch and price, the &quot;TO&quot; is sent in to drop the price and secure the down payment.

Exiting a timeshare without the cooperation of the developer is not easy, and often requires the assistance of a specialist. This specialist may be a broker who works both sides of the market, or an attorney who can litigate the contract. While some timeshare exit specialists are legitimate, the business is plagued by scammers who cold-call owners and solicit payment in advance for nonexistent services. The original buyer of a timeshare generally takes a substantial loss when a timeshare is successfully resold. In 2017, Spanish police arrested 35 people in connection with a fraudulent timeshare resale operation on the Costa del Sol that had taken an estimated £11m profit from 500 victims.

<text>Wokingham, or the Borough of Wokingham, is a local government district with borough status in Berkshire, England. Since 1998 its council has been a unitary authority, having taken on county-level functions when Berkshire County Council was abolished. The borough is named after its main town, Wokingham. Other places in the district include Arborfield, Barkham, Charvil, Earley, Finchampstead, Hurst, Remenham, Ruscombe, Shinfield, Sonning, Spencers Wood, Three Mile Cross, Twyford, Wargrave, Winnersh and Woodley. The population of the borough is 177,500 according to 2021 census.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 as Wokingham District, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Wokingham and Wokingham Rural District. It is governed by Wokingham Borough Council (formerly Wokingham District Council), which has been a unitary authority since 1 April 1998, following the abolition of Berkshire County Council under the Banham Review. The district was granted borough status in 2007, following a petition to the Queen.

==Geography==
Elevations range between 30 and 70 metres above sea level except higher in about 5% of the borough. The highest is an escarpment containing parts of the rural and wooded northern area, the hinterland of three Thames-side villages, facing the 30-mile long Chilterns AONB, west and north. A geological part of that range of hills, Bowsey Hill reaches 137m, in Wargrave civil parish, from the river.

Approximately a right-angled triangle, the borough is long north to south. It uses as its longest edge the course of the Loddon and Thames along its north-west, with a similarly salient-containing eastern boundary and an almost straight southern boundary. Clockwise the boundaries are approximately 10, 8 and 5 miles on a direct path from point to point. The southern boundary is approximately the Roman road from London to Bath through a highly coniferous Swinley Forest which sits in geology on the naturally acidic, Bagshot Formation.

The whole borough is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils of Wokingham, Earley and Woodley have officially declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &#x27;town council&#x27;. Villages include Arborfield, Barkham, Charvil, Finchampstead, Hurst, Sonning, Remenham, Ruscombe, Shinfield, Twyford, Wargrave, Three Mile Cross, Winnersh, Spencers Wood. Two villages have a wide range of small retail and visitor facilities: Wargrave and Twyford. In major employment areas of trading and manufacturing Winnersh and Finchampstead are prominent. The village of Crowthorne is shared between Wokingham and the neighbouring borough of Bracknell Forest.

==Governance==
The local authority is Wokingham Borough Council, which has its headquarters at Shute End in Wokingham.

==Education==
State-funded schools in the borough include nine secondary schools, two special schools and numerous primary schools. There are also a number of private schools.

Bracknell and Wokingham College is the main further and adult education provider for the borough, just outside the borough its headquarters is in Bracknell. The Borough&#x27;s closest higher education provider is the main Whiteknights Park campus of the University of Reading immediately north-west, most of which falls within the Wokingham Borough boundary.

==Home ownership==
The borough has the highest proportion of home ownership of the six local authorities in Berkshire: combining the social (housing association and local authority provided) and private (private landlord) rented sectors, Slough&#x27;s returns recorded in 2011 that its rented sector comprised 46% of its housing, whereas 18% of Wokingham&#x27;s residents rented their homes.

Excluding lower-tier districts, Central Government has classified Wokingham as the least needy Local Authority. Government funding is about £120 per head per year. This is the lowest among the combined category of county councils and unitary authorities, the basis on which it is overall assessed, and compares with over £1000 per head in others such as the London Borough of Hackney.


==Freedom of the Borough==

<doc id="642128" wikidata="Q4709885" url="?curid=642128" title="Albert Carnesale">
<text>Albert Carnesale (born July 2, 1936) is an American academic and a specialist in arms control and national security. He is a former chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, provost of Harvard University, and dean of the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University. He was also acting president of Harvard while President Neil L. Rudenstine was on leave for three months. He has also been active in international diplomacy on nuclear arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. From 1970 to 1972, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) with the Soviet Union—a major step towards controlling nuclear weapons. Carnesale teaches undergraduate and graduate courses at UCLA on topics relating to U.S. national security.

==Early years==
Carnesale was born on July 2, 1936, in the Bronx, New York. His father was a taxi driver; his mother was an office clerk. He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science, where admission is based solely on a competitive written exam. The first person in his family to attend college, he began his university education at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering in 1957. He received a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering at Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1961 and a PhD in nuclear engineering at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 1966. While earning his master&#x27;s degree, Carnesale also worked as a senior engineer at Martin Marietta Corporation.

==Career==
=== North Carolina State University ===
Carnesale served on the nuclear engineering faculty at NCSU from 1962 to 1969 and as professor and head of the Division of University Studies from 1972 to 1974.

===Harvard University===
Carnesale became a member of the Harvard faculty in 1974, and concentrating on the study of international relations, national security policy, and nuclear arms control. In 1981 he became academic dean of the Harvard Kennedy School. A decade later, Carnesale became dean and was charged with restructuring the school, which faced a budget deficit, and served in that post from 1991 to 1995. According to a lecturer at the School, Carnesale was appointed &quot;because by the force of his personality, his great sense of humor and his capacity for getting to the heart of things quickly, he defused tensions.&quot; When the &quot;New York Times&quot; announced the appointment, Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine described Carnesale as &quot;an exceptional human being.&quot; At the time of Carnesale&#x27;s appointment, the Kennedy School faced &quot;a debate over its identity,&quot; as tension developed between faculty who were professional scholars and those who were practitioners. Carnesale said the solution lay in finding the right balance and respecting each other&#x27;s contribution. In 1994, Carnesale was tapped to fill the role of university provost, where he served until 1997. In that position he coordinated the university&#x27;s central administration and oversaw academic programs that extended beyond Harvard&#x27;s individual schools. He was key to the university&#x27;s $2.1 billion capital campaign and efforts to apply information technology to academic and administrative operations. He also was part of the campaign to draw together Harvard&#x27;s nine different faculties. In November 1994, Carnesale was appointed acting president of Harvard while President Rudenstine was on medical leave due to exhaustion. He served in that position for three months.

===University of California, Los Angeles ===
On July 1, 1997, Carnesale was appointed chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, a position he held until June 30, 2006. Some of Carnesale&#x27;s Harvard colleagues saw his departure as &quot;a terrible loss.&quot; Some at both Harvard and UCLA were concerned about his ability to understand a large public university system. His response: &quot;I have enormous interest in all things public. I spent nine years teaching at a public university. In between I was in government. I spent my academic years at Harvard in the areas of public policy and administration.&quot;

Carnesale arrived at UCLA when the UC system was facing soaring costs and sharp budget cuts. He said the university must remain affordable for all Californians. While chancellor, he wrote and spoke about the &quot;public-private gap in higher education,&quot; presenting funding models that could potentially enable public institutions to &quot;remain true to the basic values on which they were founded: excellence and access for qualified students, regardless of ability to pay.&quot; Throughout his tenure, Carnesale concentrated on attracting research funding and private gifts to sustain UCLA&#x27;s trajectory toward the top tier of research universities in the face of declining state support. From 1997 to 2005, UCLA&#x27;s annual operating budget grew from $2.2 billion to $3.5 billion, while the state&#x27;s portion shrank from 20.7 percent to 15 percent.

When Carnesale was appointed at UCLA, California&#x27;s Proposition 209 had just gone into effect, forbidding all state institutions from giving preference in admissions based on race or ethnicity. Carnesale believed diversity was essential in order for UCLA to fulfill its responsibilities as a public university. He cited three reasons: 1) Diversity is essential for providing the best possible education because students learn from each other. 2) Diversity is necessary in order to prepare leaders for all segments of society—a charge of public universities. 3) Education is key to social and economic mobility. He said affirmative action is just one means of achieving diversity. &quot;We can encourage minority students whose records make them eligible to apply, and then encourage those admitted to enroll. . . .We have to get more minorities eligible [so] we have to get more engaged in the high schools. . . . Equal opportunity should be a goal, an aspiration.&quot; In May 1998, 88 UCLA students were arrested for refusing to leave a building during a 12-hour non-violent protest, demanding that Carnesale defy Prop 209. He replied that while he supported diversity on campus, he could not ignore Prop 209. &quot;I came to this university, knowing that Prop 209 would go into effect on my watch,&quot; he said. &quot;I made the decision that it was important to do the best we could within the law, rather than stay at Harvard and not try.&quot;

Following the events of September 11, 2001, Carnesale initiated a seminar program named for the university&#x27;s motto, , which means &quot;Let there be light.&quot; The program of 200 seminars was established to help students understand the events of September 11. The seminars enabled small, interdisciplinary groups of students to explore critical issues with faculty. Carnesale taught a seminar on national security.

As chancellor, Carnesale oversaw the completion of a $3.1 billion fundraising campaign—at the time the most ambitious in the history of higher education. He also launched the California Nanosystems Institute (CNSI), the Broad Stem Cell Research Institute, the Nazarian Center for Israeli Studies, and the Institute for Society and Genetics. Under his leadership, research funding from competitively awarded grants and contracts doubled, and UCLA formed more than 100 partnerships through Carnesale&#x27;s &quot;UCLA in L.A.&quot; initiative. During this time, the university took major steps toward transformation from a commuter school to a residential campus. From 1997 to 2005, UCLA completed or had under construction new housing for more than 4,600 undergraduate and graduate students. Other additions to the campus included the UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, Broad Art Center and new buildings for health sciences, physics, engineering, and CNSI. In addition, Glorya Kaufman Hall, Haines Hall, and the Humanities Building were renovated. Construction began on the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. UCLA Athletics added 23 NCAA titles.

When Carnesale announced that he was stepping down in 2006, he said he had missed teaching and policymaking and that his decision was prompted in part by current events. He said there were relatively few people working in national security who had Ph.D.s in fields like nuclear engineering. &quot;If you&#x27;re worried about nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction and the like, and can bring that technical background as well as the policy background in international affairs and security . . . It&#x27;s a comparative advantage that I have in an area that&#x27;s terribly important to the country right now. When he stepped down, he took a year-long sabbatical and then resumed teaching in UCLA&#x27;s Luskin School of Public Affairs and Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. In 2013, a new building in the residential portion of the UCLA campus was named Robin and Albert Carnesale Commons in honor of the chancellor emeritus and his wife. The building houses one of the nation&#x27;s first health-themed dining halls, as well as a fitness hall and multipurpose space.

=== Government and public policy ===
From 1969 to 1972 Carnesale served as chief of the Defensive Weapons Systems Division, Science and Technology Bureau of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in Washington, D.C. From 1970 to 1972, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) with the Soviet Union -- a major step towards controlling nuclear weapons.

Between 1977 and 1980, he led the U.S. delegation to the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE). This 66-nation multilateral meeting was intended to investigate and ultimately make recommendations regarding the relationships between civilian and military uses of nuclear energy and materials. In 1980 Carnesale was nominated by President Carter to be chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. However, Carter&#x27;s term as president ended before the nomination was brought to a Senate vote. At the time of Carnesale&#x27;s nomination, one of his Harvard colleagues said, &quot;He&#x27;s really perfect for the job. First, he&#x27;s got a technical background--he&#x27;s not a political appointee. At the same time, he can communicate complex technical issues in a way that is understandable to lay audiences.&quot; In 1995, President Clinton appointed Carnesale to the Scientific and Policy Advisory Committee of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

In 2009, Carnesale chaired a National Academies committee overseeing efforts to outline &quot;America&#x27;s Climate Choices&quot; at the request of Congress. When the committee submitted their report, in 2011, Carnesale said, [Climate change] is an urgent problem to turn to, and what we&#x27;ve done differently is look at this as a risk management problem. We don&#x27;t know exactly when the tsunami will hit or how high it will be, but we know it is coming, and we should prepare.&quot; In 2010 the U.S. Department of Energy appointed Carnesale to a high-level national commission on nuclear waste production, the 15-person Blue Ribbon Commission on America&#x27;s Nuclear Future. Carnesale said the issues before the commission related &quot;not only to nuclear power and reduced dependence on fossil fuels but also to climate change and nuclear proliferation.&quot; In 2014, he was appointed to the U.S. Secretary of Energy&#x27;s Advisory Board. He also chaired the National Academies Committees on NASA&#x27;s Strategic Direction, on Nuclear Forensics and on the U.S. Conventional Prompt Global Strike. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Pacific Council on International Policy.

== Honors ==
Carnesale was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996 and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2008. In 2011 he received the Harvard Medal for service to the university. Also in 2011, he was elected to the Nation Academy of Engineering &quot;for bringing engineering excellence and objectivity to international security and arms control, and for leadership in higher education.&quot; In 1997, he received an honorary doctor of letters degree from NCSU. He also holds honorary degrees from Harvard University (A.M.), New Jersey Institute of Technology (Sc.D.), Drexel University (LL.D.) and Pardee RAND Graduate School (D.P.P). In 1985, he received the Gano Dunn Award for Outstanding Professional Achievement from the Cooper Union.

<text>Specularity is the visual appearance of specular reflections. 

==In computer graphics==
In computer graphics, it means the quantity used in three-dimensional (3D) rendering which represents the amount of reflectivity a surface has. It is a key component in determining the brightness of specular highlights, along with to determine the size of the highlights.

It is frequently used in real-time computer graphics and ray tracing, where the mirror-like specular reflection of light from other surfaces is often ignored (due to the more intensive computations required to calculate it), and the specular reflection of light directly from point light sources is modeled as specular highlights.

=== Specular mapping ===

A materials system may allow specularity to vary across a surface, controlled by additional layers of texture maps.

===The early misinterpretation of &quot;Specularity&quot; in computer graphics===

Early shaders included a parameter called &quot;Specularity&quot;. CG Artists, confused by this term discovered by experimentation that the manipulation of this parameter would cause a reflected highlight from a light source to appear and disappear and therefore misinterpreted &quot;specularity&quot; to mean &quot;light highlights&quot;. In fact &quot;Specular&quot; is defined in optics as &quot;Optics. (of reflected light) directed, as from a smooth, polished surface (opposed to diffuse ).&quot; A specular surface is a highly smooth surface. When the surface is very smooth, the reflected highlight is easy to see. As the surface becomes rougher, the reflected highlights gets broader and dimmer. This is a more &quot;diffused&quot; reflection.

==In seismology==
In the context of seismic migration, specularity is defined as the cosine of the angle made by the surface normal vector and the angle bisector of the angle defined by the directions of the incident and diffracted rays. For a purely specular seismic event the value of specularity should be equal to unity, as the angle between the surface normal vector and the angle bisector should be zero, according to Snell&#x27;s Law. For a diffractive seismic event, the specularity can be sub-unitary. During the seismic migration, one can filter each seismic event according to the value of specularity, in order to enhance the contribution of diffractions in the seismic image. Alternatively, the events can be separated in different sub-images according to the value of specularity to produce a specularity gather.

<doc id="642141" wikidata="Q13581586" url="?curid=642141" title="Bishopsgate railway station">
<text>Bishopsgate was a railway station located on the eastern side of Shoreditch High Street in the parish of Bethnal Green (now within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets) on the western edge of the East End of London and just outside the City of London.

It was in use from 1840 to 1875 as a passenger station and then as a freight terminal until it was destroyed by fire in 1964. Substantial remains lay derelict until they were demolished in the early 2000s to make way for Shoreditch High Street railway station which now stands on part of the site.

==History of the site up to 1840==

In connection with the extension of the East London Line, some archaeological excavations were undertaken on the site 2007-2010 by the Museum of London Archaeology Service. To the west of the site the discovery of Mesolithic struck flint suggested occupation of the banks of the River Walpole. Bishopsgate follows the line of the Roman road and burial plots were found on both sides of the road. The site remained as open fields until the 17th century although there were a number of brick quarries giving their name to Brick Lane, which were active as long ago as the 14th century. The area developed with residential and industrial premises between 1652 and 1682, and this grew up and by the time of the development had declined into one of the poorest areas of London well known for its criminal elements.

===Construction (1838–1840)===

When initially surveyed in 1834 the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) considered a number of sites before settling on Shoreditch. These were reviewed in detail by engineer John Braithwaite and the more difficult sites discounted. A major reason for selecting the Shoreditch site was it was close to the financial district and land at that location was relatively cheap. The area it was being built in was by this time riven by poverty and criminality and during construction armed guards were provided.

Unfortunately for the ECR, the landowners soon realised they could extract a high price for the required land and many delayed for a better price. Although work had begun on the ECR line in late March 1837, it was not until 1838 that work commenced between Shoreditch and Bow. Meanwhile, the Northern and Eastern Railway were looking at a London terminus in Islington and had also given up negotiating access to the Commercial Railway line to Minories in 1838 The ECR invited the N&amp;ER to share the Shoreditch site and the plan was to have two separate stations, one for each company, on the same site. As the build commenced, this plan was abandoned and the station was designed to operate as a single entity.

==Passenger railway station (1840–1873)==
===Description===
The station was built as part of the London Viaduct engineered by John Braithwaite. The structure was a mile and a quarter long and consisted mostly of brick arches with three cast iron arches, between Shoreditch and Devonshire Street, over Dog Row, Hare Marsh and Globe Road.

When originally built the station had five tracks and these were covered with an overall roof. The two outer tracks each had a platform – one for arrivals and one for departures – whilst the three inner tracks were used for stabling carriages between services. There were a number of small turntables that were used to transfer carriages from one track to another. The carriages at this time were based on the stagecoach design and were shorter than modern day carriages so the space required to move them between tracks was less.

Arriving trains were stopped outside the station and the locomotive would run round the carriages to propel them first to one of two ticket inspection platforms, where ticket inspectors would check tickets, before the train pulled forward into the arrival platform. Later ticket inspection was transferred to the station itself.

The structure itself had three levels above street level and the railway was on the first level above the street and approached by ramps. The architect was Sancton Wood and the station building had two four-storey towers. The main roof was constructed of corrugated iron as were the two side roofs covering the arrival and departure platforms. The main roof was supported by two rows of 17 columns.

As the railways expanded, further platforms were added on the north/west side of the complex notably for the introduction of the North Woolwich services. A short bay platform was also added on the opposite side of the station.

There were a number of goods facilities on the approach to the station and over the years these expanded and stretched back to Bethnal Green. Locomotives could be turned, coaled and watered just outside the station or would run back to the nearest engine shed at Stratford.

A full description dated 1844 in &quot;The Builder&quot; magazine stated:

===History===
The station was opened with the name Shoreditch (or London) on 1 July 1840 to serve as its new permanent terminus when the railway was extended westwards from an earlier temporary terminus at Devonshire Street, near Mile End.

The Northern and Eastern Railway started operating services to and from Shoreditch on 15 September 1840.

When the station opened it was not completed and work continued on the site for many years although this is partly attributable to the fact railways grew in popularity.

In the early years the station handled goods traffic as well as passenger traffic. As the latter increased it became impractical to unload goods at the station (which included cattle) and a new goods facility was opened at Brick Lane in 1844 (although goods traffic continued until 1845 at Shoreditch).

As built the track gauge on the ECR was 5 feet but provision was made to convert it to Great Western broad gauge had that gauge been adopted as a national standard. With the extension of the ECR in the early 1840s, it became apparent that was a better choice, and in September and October 1844 gauge conversion was carried out throughout the ECR and N&amp;ER systems.

The station was renamed Bishopsgate on 27 July 1846 with the intention of drawing more City commuters by naming it after the major thoroughfare in the heart of the financial district.

By 1847 the ticket inspection platform on the south side had been converted into an arrival platform and an additional platform was provided on the north side for the North Woolwich services. Trains used a timber viaduct built on brick piers to access the platform which had its own booking office. The ECR hoped traffic would be generated by a ferry connection to Woolwich which at that time had no rail link.

By 1850 the departure platform had been extended and widened at the expense of one of the three stabling sidings located between the arrival and departure platforms. The turntable had been enlarged reflecting that larger more powerful locomotives were operating the services, and the station buildings were also extended at this time.

A big storm on 26/27 December 1852 saw the corrugated iron roof damaged beyond repair and this was replaced during 1853. During 1853 the southern side of the viaduct was extended to enable lengthening of the 1847 arrival platform.

By the end of 1853 an additional platform had been added on the north side (near to the North Woolwich platform) and two further sidings were added. These were used as rail access to a street level coal depot.

By 1855 a further bay platform had been added on the south side.

In 1862, the ECR amalgamated with a number of other East Anglian railway companies to form the Great Eastern Railway (GER). At the time the GER also used Fenchurch Street as a terminus but with new lines planned the GER decided the Bishopsgate station was too cramped (and badly positioned) for further development as a passenger service and began building the approaches to a new station at Liverpool Street in 1865.

The GER did extend the northside of the viaduct approaching Bishopsgate which saw the N&amp;ER Brick Lane goods depot (see below) demolished. It is thought this was to improve access to the coal depot at Bishopsgate. Continuing congestion issues saw two new platforms built as late as 1872 on the site of the former coal depot. This was then final alteration at Bishopsgate which totalled eight platforms on closure to passengers.

The new extension to Liverpool Street opened to a new station called Bishopsgate (Low Level) in 1872, before extension into the new Liverpool Street station which opened in 1874. After a brief period where both terminus stations were in operation and Bishopsgate Low Level station operated as a through station, Bishopsgate station was closed to passenger traffic on 1 November 1875.

The new line into Liverpool Street paralleled the viaduct so a number of goods facilities were demolished or altered at this time.

===Passenger services===
When the station opened on services were run by the Eastern Counties Railway to Romford there were 11 weekday ECR trains to Brentwood. This increased to 18 when the Northern and Eastern Railway started operation on 15 September 1840.

As new lines were built other destinations were served.

* Bishops Stortford 1842
* Colchester 1843 
* Hertford 1843
* Cambridge 1845
* Norwich (via Cambridge) 1845
* Ipswich 1846 (via Eastern Union Railway)
* North Woolwich 1847
* Enfield (via Angel Road) 1849

The Bradshaw&#x27;s Railway Guide dated 1 March 1850 had the following services departing Shoreditch (although the station had been renamed Bishopsgate in 1846):
Generally, there was a 15-minute time interval between services which was the journey time of a stopping train to Stratford (calling at Mile End and Victoria Park &amp; Bow. A fast train took 10 minutes which was the minimum time allowed, and a physical barrier was placed across the track after a train had departed. Absolute block between Bishopsgate and Stratford was introduced in 1851. Some services operated together with the coaches for the rear service being slipped approaching Stratford.

Following the opening of the London Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) in 1854, services from Tilbury and, by 1856 Southend, operated via Stratford where the train would split into Bishopsgate and Fenchurch Street portions. This arrangement lasted until 1858 when the LT&amp;SR opened a more direct route avoiding an increasingly busy Stratford station. Other ECR services to Loughton and about half of the North Woolwich operated from Fenchurch Street rather than Bishospgate. The London &amp; Blackwall Railway charged for each train using Fenchurch Street and a dispute lasting until 1857 saw some Loughton line services using Bishopsgate for a period.

By the 1860s with the suburbs expanding and new lines being proposed the GER decided to build a new bigger terminus nearer the city at Liverpool Street. As part of this project a new station called Bishopsgate (Low Level) was opened in 1872 and acted as a temporary terminus for suburban services from the Enfield (via Seven Sisters) and Walthamstow lines. Early in 1874 the first four platforms at Liverpool Street station opened, and Bishopsgate (Low Level) station became a normal through station. However, longer distance trains continued to use Bishopsgate (High-Level) as it was referred to then.

===Staffing===
An 1844 report for the ECR recommended staffing levels as:

===Accidents and incidents===
*On 21 November 1856, nine people were injured in a low-speed collision at Bishopsgate. The author of a Board of Trade report into the incident stated: &quot;I have no doubt that it was occasioned by the carelessness of the driver, and a loose way of conducting the shunting in the yard; and I am of the opinion that proper instructions on the subject of signalling for the shunting of trains should form part of those issued for the guidance of drivers and shunters.&quot;
*On 22 November 1871, a head-on collision due to a driver&#x27;s error and inadequate signalling resulted in a derailment. Fourteen people were injured in the incident.
*On 19 June 1872, the driver of a service from Enfield on its approach to Bishopsgate crossed the path of a Shenfield-bound train, resulting in a collision that injured eight people.
*On 9 August 1872, six people were injured when a train hit the buffers at Bishopsgate. The Board of Trade reported: &quot;The accident appears to have been caused by miscalculation on the part of the engine-driver of the speed at which he was entering the station.&quot;

==Goods station==
Bishopsgate was extensively reconstructed by the Great Eastern Railway between 1878 and 1880 to convert it into a goods station. &quot;By May 1880 the old facade and side walls had been completely removed.&quot;

The new goods station opened in 1881 and became known as Bishopsgate goods yard. The existing depot at Brick Lane closed as a consequence.
The new goods depot had three levels.

* A basement at street level – this was in two separate halves with the site being bisected by Wheeler Street. Wagons could be lowered to this level and moved around by a system of rails and pulleys.
* The rail level – hoists from this level connected to the basement level. There were ten sidings for the wagons to be loaded and unloaded grouped around five loading banks.
* A warehouse above the rail level where incoming goods could be stored in the warehouse on-site or transferred directly to road vehicles for onward transportation to their destinations.

There was also a large cartage yard at rail level. For many years most of the goods would have gone on by horse and cart and the GER maintained stables nearby in Quaker Street.

As a goods depot, Bishopsgate handled very large volumes of goods from the eastern ports and was arranged over three levels with turntables and hoists allowing railway wagons to be moved individually around the station for loading and unloading.

===London &amp; North Eastern Railway (1923–1947)===
Following the Railways Act 1921, Bishopsgate goods station become a London and North Eastern Railway facility on 1 January 1923.

During the 1920s there were 1,020 people employed on the site including 648 being employed in the delivery of goods (cartage), 200-300 clerical staff and operating staff. It is likely at times of high demand, temporary staff were taken on to assist with loading and unloading wagons.

During the 1930s typically 350 wagons per day would be dealt with, equating to between 20 and 30 trains per day. During the fruit and vegetable seasons this number might reach 850.

===The nationalisation era (1948–1964)===

Following nationalisation on 1 January 1948 Bishopsgate Goods station became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways.
By the 1950s the majority of trains serving Bishopsgate were transfer-freights from Temple Mills or Goodmayes yards, although direct services carrying goods from Europe operated from Parkeston Quay. To allow processing of this traffic, facilities at Bishopsgate included a bonded customs store. The bulk of the traffic was food with two fish trains arriving overnight. The yard also handled steel, machinery and small containers (the forerunner of today&#x27;s intermodal container wagons). During the late 1950s/1960s it was difficult to recruit staff to work the yard as better paid opportunities were available within London.

Shunting was carried out by steam locomotives in the 1950s – generally former GER 0-6-0T locomotives from classes J67 or J69. These would have been replaced by small diesel shunters later in the decade. Some railtours used Bishopsgate in its latter years.

A major fire on 5 December 1964 destroyed the station. Within 40 minutes of the first firefighters arriving on scene, the scale of the blaze was so intense and widespread that the London Fire Brigade had mobilised 40 fire engines. In addition, 12 aerial turntable platforms, two firehose-laying vehicles and two emergency tenders as well as 235 firefighters battled the fire which killed two customs officials, Mr Thomas S. Tanner aged 44 and Mr George Humphrey aged about 60, and destroyed hundreds of railway wagons, dozens of motor vehicles and millions of pounds worth of goods. At this time 1200 people were employed on the site.

The station was subsequently closed and the upper-level structures were largely demolished.

==After closure (1964–present day)==

Over the next 40 years much of the site became derelict. Following an extended period of planning, the entire site was demolished in 2003–04, with the exception of a number of Grade II listed structures: ornamental gates on Shoreditch High Street and the remaining of the so-called &quot;Braithwaite Viaduct&quot;, one of the oldest railway structures in the world and the second-oldest in London. The demolition of the former Bishopsgate station made way for Shoreditch High Street station on the East London line extension in 2010, part of the new London Overground network, replacing Shoreditch Underground station to the east which had closed in June 2006.

The rail bridge that passed over the Liverpool Street approaches and into the site was demolished over Christmas 2007.

A mixed-use development on the former goods yard site, named The Goodsyard, has also been proposed.

==Other goods facilities==
The line between Bishospgate and Bethnal Green was lined with a number of other goods facilities.

===Brick Lane===
The Northern and Eastern Railway opened a small goods depot here in 1843. This depot was closed in 1865 when additional tracks into Bishopsgate were provided.

This was followed by the ECR goods facility which opened slightly to the east in May or June 1844 and was located north of the line. The facility was later expanded and occupied a sizeable plot.

The shed was located at street level and a steeply graded cable worked incline saw wagons lowered from track to street level. This was later replaced by a number of wagon hoists.

The Brick Lane facility closed and was replaced by the Bishopsgate Goods station in 1882.

===Pedley Street Goods depot===
This was located east of the granary (below) and opened in 1848. However, the site was used by the granary expansion in the 1850s and it was demolished during 1852 and 1853.

===The Granary===
Located near Pedley Street this was constructed in the 1840s and is thought to have been opened in October 1846. It was located on the south side of the viaduct, and the granary was further extended taking over the goods depot site (above) and opening in October 1854.

At its greatest extent it had enough storage capacity to store 44,000 sacks of grain.

The granary was destroyed by a fire on 1 January 1919 that burned for two days.

===Shoreditch Coal depot===
Opened in 1868 by the GER, this was located south and west of Bethnal Green station and its main feature was a curving brick viaduct carrying six lines. At ground level, the arches were rented out by coal merchants and used for storage with coal being dropped directly into the arches from the wagons above. A couple of sidings were provided at ground level and accessed through a hoist in the granary. In 1900 a steel viaduct was built with a two-wagon hoist to serve the street level sidings and a siding on the East London Line.

Transfers to the East London Line stopped in the 1950s although the hoist was used to supply the ground-level sidings in the coal yard. The yard was run down and closed in the 1960s. A small section of the brick viaduct exists at the end of Tent Street E15.

Before Shoreditch coal depot was built a small coal depot existed on the northern side of the Bishopsgate site and it is thought this closed &quot;c1872/3&quot; when two new platforms were added.

<text>KrAZ (, &quot;Kremenchutskyi Avtomobilnyi Zavod&quot;, Kremenchuk Automobile Plant, АвтоКрА́З or AvtoKrAZ) is a factory in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, that produces trucks and other special-purpose vehicles, particularly heavy-duty off-road models. The factory was incorporated as a holding company combining several other factories nationwide and becoming the industrial wing of the finance-industrial group Finance and Credit, which also held the Finance and Credit bank.

==History==
=== Soviet era ===
KrAZ was founded on 31 August 1945 when the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Transportation Routes issued a warrant to build a mechanical bridge plant in Kremenchuk. The first brick was laid in the plant foundation in 1946 and during the next eight years it produced about 600 bridges with the total length of about 27 km for use on the Dnieper, Moscow, Dniester, Volga and Daugava rivers etc. In 1956 the plant has manufactured combine harvesters and other farming machines. The Kremenchuk Combine Plant has produced 11,000 agricultural machines in the first two years of its existence.

On April 17, 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to rebuild a plant for heavy-duty vehicle production. Heavy-duty truck manufacture was transferred from the Yaroslavl Motor Plant (YaAZ). The first two KrAZ-222 dump trucks were assembled from imported units and components on 10 April 1959, and by 1961 the plant exported over 500 vehicles in 26 countries of the world such as Argentina, Afghanistan, Bulgaria, China, India, Vietnam etc.

On December 30, 1968, 100,000th truck was assembled at the KrAZ main assembly plant

On January 26, 1971, KrAZ was awarded the Order of Lenin for completion of the five-year plan ahead of schedule and successful developments of new truck models. On January 15, 1976, the plant became &quot;AvtoKrAZ&quot;.

On April 30, 1984, 500,000th truck was assembled at the KrAZ main assembly plant.

By 1986 the KrAZ&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 30655 vehicles.

1990 the KrAZ&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 27667 trucks. 1991 the KrAZ&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 25094 trucks.

=== Ukrainian era ===

In March 1993 750,000th truck was assembled at the KrAZ main assembly plant.

KrAZ was registered as a Holding company in June 1996. 1996 the company&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 1919 trucks.

In 1999, the privatization of KrAZ began. 1999 the company&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 827 trucks

In 2001, a block of stock being purchased by a joint Ukrainian-German enterprise called Mega-Motors.

In 2003, KrAZ opened vehicle assembly plants in Russia and Vietnam. In 2004 KrAZ was awarded an order for 2200 KrAZ vehicles to be delivered to Iraq. KrAZ received an ISO 9001:2000 for quality control.

On January 27, 2006, the 800,000th truck was assembled at the KrAZ main assembly plant. In October of the same year KrAZ won first prize among 100 Ukrainian companies with the best rate of development according to the net profit growth pursuant to the results of rating &quot;Top 100 Most dynamic companies&quot;

In 2007, the company&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 4206 trucks

After the Financial crisis of 2007–08 orders for vehicles declined drastically as Ukraine was severely affected by the event, the factory worked at minimal capacity. 2009 the company&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 280 trucks

In 2010, the company&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 1002 trucks

On August 23, 2011, the KrAZ-5233 &quot;Spetsnaz&quot; entered into service with the Ukrainian Army.
In 2013, the company&#x27;s yearly production output totalled 891 trucks.

The government of Ukraine placed large orders for new military vehicles.
The Border Guards, National Guard, and Army of Ukraine have all been scheduled to receive new KrAZ armored trucks. Moreover, KrAZ partnered with the Canadian defense firm Streit Group to produce the Cougar and Spartan armored vehicles. A total of 21 Spartans were ordered with the Ministry of Defense having an option for an additional 40, 20 Cougars were also ordered.

Several Streit Group Spartan APC&#x27;s were seen at the Kyiv independence day parade indicating that the order was at least partially complete.

In November 2014, the Ukrainian government placed an order for 1200 vehicles and 200 armored personnel carriers. The contract was worth ₴1 billion ($64,267,360.00).

On 19 May 2021, KrAZ signed a three-year contract to supply the United States Army Contracting Command with KrAZ 4x4 heavy-duty vehicles and spare parts.

== 2022 Nationalisation ==
On November 6, 2022, the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used martial law to nationalise the company. “Such steps, which are necessary for our country in conditions of war, are carried out in accordance with current laws and will help meet the urgent needs of our defense sector.” The government of Ukraine also took control of engine maker Motor Sich, energy companies Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta and transformer maker Zaporozhtransformator at the same time.

<doc id="642147" wikidata="Q208398" url="?curid=642147" title="Karaite Judaism">
<text>Karaism is a non-Rabbinical Jewish sect characterized by the recognition of the written Tanakh alone as its supreme authority in &quot;halakha&quot; (religious law) and theology. Karaites believe that all of the divine commandments which were handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah without any additional Oral Law or explanation. Unlike mainstream Rabbinic Judaism, which regards the Oral Torah, codified in the Talmud and subsequent works, as authoritative interpretations of the Torah, Karaite Jews do not treat the written collections of the oral tradition in the Midrash or the Talmud as binding.

Karaite interpretation of the Torah strives to adhere to the plain or most obvious meaning (&quot;peshat&quot;) of the text; this is not necessarily the literal meaning of the text—instead, it is the meaning of the text that would have been naturally understood by the ancient Hebrews when the books of the Torah were first written—without the use of the Oral Torah. By contrast, Rabbinic Judaism relies on the legal rulings of the Sanhedrin as they are codified in the Midrash, Talmud, and other sources to indicate the authentic meaning of the Torah. Karaism holds every interpretation of the Torah to the same scrutiny regardless of its source, and teaches that it is the personal responsibility of every individual Jew to study the Torah, and ultimately to decide personally its correct meaning. Karaites may consider arguments made in the Talmud and other works, but without exalting them above other viewpoints.

According to the Karaite Mordecai ben Nissan (born 1650), the ancestors of the Karaites were a group called &quot;Benei Ṣedeq&quot; during the Second Temple period. Historians have argued over whether Karaism has a direct connection to the Sadducees dating back to the end of the Second Temple period (70 CE) or whether Karaism represents a novel emergence of similar views. Karaites have always maintained that while there are some similarities to the Sadducees due to the rejection of rabbinical authority and of the Oral Law, there are major differences.

According to Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud, in his &quot;Sefer ha-Qabbalah&quot; (written 1160), the Karaite movement crystallized in Baghdad in the Gaonic period ( 7th–9th centuries) under the Abbasid Caliphate in present-day Iraq. This is the view universally accepted among Rabbinic Jews. However, some Arab scholars claim that Karaites were already living in Egypt in the first half of the seventh century, based on a legal document that the Karaite community in Egypt had in its possession until the end of the 19th century, in which the first Islamic governor ordered the leaders of the Rabbinite community against interfering with Karaite practices or with the way they celebrate their holidays. It was said to have been stamped by the palm of Amr ibn al-ʿĀṣ as-Sahmī, the first Islamic governor of Egypt (d. 664), and was reportedly dated 20 AH (641 CE).

At one time, Karaites made up about 10 percent of the Jewish population. However as of 2013, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 Karaites resided in Israel, with smaller communities in Turkey, Europe and the United States. A 2007 report estimated that, of 30,000 worldwide, more than 20,000 descend from those who made aliyah from Egypt and Iraq to Israel. The largest Karaite community today resides in the Israeli city of Ashdod.

==History==

===Origins===

Some scholars trace the origin of Karaism to those who rejected the Talmudic tradition as an innovation. Judah Halevi, an 11th-century Jewish philosopher and rabbi, wrote a defense for Rabbinic Judaism entitled &quot;Kuzari&quot;, placing the origins of Karaism in the first and second centuries BCE, during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (&quot;King Jannai&quot;), king of Judaea from 103 to 76 BCE:

Abraham Geiger, a 19th-century German scholar who founded Reform Judaism, posited a connection between the Karaites and a remnant of the Sadducees, the 1st-century Jewish sect that followed the Hebrew Bible literally and rejected the Pharisees&#x27; notion of an Oral Torah even before it was written. Geiger&#x27;s view is based on comparison between Karaite and Sadducee &quot;halakha&quot;: for example, a minority in Karaite Judaism do not believe in a resurrection of the dead or afterlife, a position also held by the Sadducees. The British theologian John Gill (1767) noted, 
Gill also traces the Karaite sect to the split between the schools of Hillel the Elder and Shammai in 30 BCE.

American scholar Bernard Revel rejects many of Geiger&#x27;s arguments in his 1913 published dissertation, &quot;The Karaite Halakah&quot;. Revel also points to the many correlations between Karaite halakha and theology and the interpretations of Philo of Alexandria, the 1st-century philosopher and Jewish scholar. He also notes the writings of a 10th-century Karaite who refers to Philo&#x27;s works, showing that the Karaites made use of Philo&#x27;s writings in the development of their movement. Later Medieval Karaite commentators did not view Philo in a favorable light. These attitudes show a friction between later Karaite theology and possible connections to Philo&#x27;s philosophy, which could serve as either a rejection of their origins, rejection of theological positions no longer accepted, or that Philo&#x27;s philosophy was not entirely used in the founding of the Karaites (although some influences remain possible).

Early 20th-century scholars Oesterley and Box suggested that Karaism formed in a reaction to the rise of Islam. The new religion recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith, but claimed that it detracted from its belief by deferring to rabbinical authority.

===9th century===
Anan ben David (, c. 715 – 795 or 811?) is widely considered to be a major founder of the Karaite movement. His followers, called Ananites, did not believe the rabbinical oral law was divinely inspired.

According to a 12th-century Rabbinic account, in approximately 760, Shelomoh ben Ḥisdai II, the Exilarch in Babylon died, and two brothers among his nearest kin, ʻAnan ben David (whose name according to the Rabbinical account was ʻAnan ben Shafaṭ, but was called &quot;ben David&quot; due to his Davidic lineage) and Ḥananyah were next in order of succession. Eventually, Ḥananyah was elected by the rabbis of the Babylonian Jewish colleges (the Geonim) and by the notables of the chief Jewish congregations, and the choice was confirmed by the Caliph of Baghdad.

A schism may have occurred, with ʻAnan ben David being proclaimed exilarch by his followers. However, not all scholars agree that this event occurred. Leon Nemoy notes, &quot;Natronai, scarcely ninety years after ‘Anan&#x27;s secession, tells us nothing about his aristocratic (Davidic) descent or about the contest for the office of exilarch which allegedly served as the immediate cause of his apostasy.&quot; Nemoy later notes that Natronai—a devout Rabbanite—lived where ʻAnan&#x27;s activities took place, and that the Karaite sage Jacob Qirqisani never mentioned ʻAnan&#x27;s purported lineage or candidacy for Exilarch.

ʻAnan&#x27;s allowing his followers to proclaim him as Exilarch was considered treason by the Muslim government. He was sentenced to death, but his life was saved by his fellow prisoner, Abu Hanifa, the founder of the madhhab or school of fiqh (Muslim jurisprudence) known as the Hanafi. Ultimately he and his followers were permitted to migrate to Palestine. They erected a synagogue in Jerusalem that continued to be maintained until the time of the Crusades. From this center, the sect diffused thinly over Syria, spread into Egypt, and ultimately reached Southeast Europe.

Ben David challenged the Rabbinical establishment. Some scholars believe that his followers may have absorbed Jewish Babylonian sects such as the Isunians (followers of Abū ʻĪsā al-Iṣfahānī), Yudghanites, and the remnants of the pre-Talmudic Sadducees and Boethusians. Later, sects such as the Ukbarites emerged separately from the Ananites.

However, the Isunians, Yudghanites, Ukabarites, and Mishawites all held views that did not accord with those of either the Ananites or the Karaites. Abū ʻĪsā al-Iṣfahānī, who was an illiterate tailor, claimed to be a prophet, prohibited divorce, claimed that all months should have thirty days, believed in Jesus and Muhammad as prophets, and told his followers that they must study the New Testament and the Quran. Yudghan was a follower of Abū ʻĪsā al-Iṣfahānī and claimed to be a prophet and the Messiah, saying that the observance of Shabbat and Holy Days was no longer obligatory. Isma‘il al-‘Ukbari believed he was the prophet Elijah, and hated ʻAnan. Mishawayh al-‘Ukbari, who was a disciple of Isma‘il al-‘Ukbari and the founder of the Mishawites, taught his followers to use a purely solar calendar of 364 days and 30-day months, insisting that all the Holy Days and fast days should always occur on fixed days in the week, rather than on fixed days of the months. He further said that Shabbat should be kept from sunrise on Saturday to sunrise on Sunday. Most Ananites and Karaites rejected such beliefs.

ʻAnan developed his movement&#x27;s core tenets. His &quot;Sefer HaMiṣwot&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Commandments&quot;) was published about 770. He adopted many principles and opinions of other anti-rabbinic forms of Judaism that had previously existed. He took much from the old Sadducees and Essenes, whose remnants still survived, and whose writings—or at least writings ascribed to them—were still in circulation. Thus, for example, these older sects prohibited the burning of any lights and the leaving of one&#x27;s dwelling on the Sabbath. Unlike the Sadducees, ʻAnan and the Qumran sectaries allowed persons to leave their house, but prohibited leaving one&#x27;s town or camp. ʻAnan said that one should not leave one&#x27;s house for frivolous things, but only to go to prayer or to study scripture. The Sadducees required the observation of the new moon to establish the dates of festivals and always held the Shavuot festival on a Sunday.

===The Golden Age===
In the &quot;Golden Age of Karaism&quot; (900–1100) a large number of Karaite works were produced in all parts of the Muslim world, the most notable being a work penned by Jacob Qirqisani, entitled &quot;Kitāb al-Anwār wal-Marāqib&quot; (&quot;Code of Karaite Law&quot;), which provides valuable information concerning the development of Karaism and throws light also on many questions in Rabbinic Judaism. Karaite Jews were able to obtain autonomy from Rabbinic Judaism in the Muslim world and establish their own institutions. Karaites in the Muslim world also obtained high social positions such as tax collectors, doctors, and clerks, and even received special positions in the Egyptian courts. Karaite scholars were among the most conspicuous practitioners of the philosophical school known as Jewish Kalam. 

According to historian Salo Wittmayer Baron, at one time as much as 10 percent of world Jewry was affiliated with Karaism, and debates between Rabbinic and Karaite leaders were not uncommon.

Among the staunchest critics of Karaite thought and practice at this time was Saadia Gaon, whose writings brought about a permanent split between some Karaite and Rabbinic communities.

===Anecdote about Karaites in Egypt during the 13th-century===
Egypt had long been a bastion for Karaites and their teachings. According to David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra, in one day in Egypt, a great congregation of Karaites became Rabbinical Jews during the time of the Nagid Rabbi Abraham Maimonides, who, in his words, &quot;was not reluctant to receive them.&quot;

===Karaites in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union===

During the 19th century, Russian authorities began to differentiate Karaite Jews from Rabbanite Jews, freeing them from various oppressive laws that affected Rabbinic Jews. In the 1830s the Tsarist governor of the Taurida Governorate, Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, told the Karaite leaders that, even though the Russian Empire liked the idea that the Karaites did not accept the Talmud, they were still Jews and responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus and thus subject to the laws. The leaders, hearing that, devised a ruse by which they could be freed of the oppressive laws and told him that the Karaites had already settled in the Crimea before the death of Jesus. The Tsarist government then said that, if they could prove it, they would be free of the oppressive laws.

The community leaders charged Abraham Firkovich (1786–1874) with gathering anything that could help show that Karaites were not in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus, and thus not responsible for the crucifixion. Through his work, Firkovich helped establish the idea among the Russian authorities that the Karaites, as descendants of the exiled northern kingdom of Israel, had already gone into exile centuries before the death of Jesus and thus had no responsibility for it. Firkovich referenced tombstones in Crimea (altering the dates) and gathered thousands of Karaite, Rabbinic, and Samaritan manuscripts, including one rabbinic document from Transcaucasia that claims that the Jews there were descendants of the exiles from the northern Kingdom of Israel. 

These actions convinced the Tsar that Karaite ancestors could not have killed Jesus and that thus their descendants were free of familial guilt.

Despite this, within the community &quot;Ḥakhamim&quot; still taught that the Karaites were and had always been a part of the Jewish people; prayer was in Hebrew, the lineage of Kohens, Levites, and families of Davidic descent were meticulously preserved, and books printed in Hebrew adamantly identified the Karaites as Jews.

In 1897, the Russian census counted 12,894 Karaites in the Russian Empire.

By the early 20th century, most European Karaites were no longer very knowledgeable about the religion and Seraya Shapshal, a Karaite soldier of fortune who had been the tutor of the last Qajar Shah of Persia, Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar, and a Russian spy, managed c. 1911 to get himself elected Chief &quot;Ḥakham&quot; of the Karaites in the Russian Empire (by that time, due to Russian regulations, the position had become more of a political than a spiritual one). Influenced by the Pan-Turkic movement in Turkey, Shapshal made his position into something of a Priest-king. He changed the title &quot;Hakham&quot; to &quot;Ḥakhan&quot; (a portmanteau between &quot;Hakham&quot; and the Mongol-Turkic title khan), forbade the use of Hebrew, and in the 1930s reintroduced Yahwist elements (such as the veneration of sacred oak trees in the cemetery). He also recognized both Jesus and Muhammad as prophets (in order to appease both the Tsarist Russian Orthodox government and the Muslim Turkic peoples).

After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, atheism became official state policy in Soviet territories and Karaite religious schools and places of worship were the very first religious institutions closed by the Soviet government. The authorities allowed only the teaching of Shapshalian doctrines about the Karaites, and the official stance according to Soviet law (carried over from Russian Imperial law) erroneously regarded the Karaites as Turkic descendants of the Khazars and not as Jews.

Not all European Karaites accepted the Shapshalian doctrines. Some Hachamim and a small part of the general Karaite population still preserved their Jewish heritage, but most dared not oppose Shapshal openly due to his official standing with regard to the Soviet Union.

===Karaites in Egypt===

The Karaite community in Egypt was considered one of the oldest and had existed in that country for about 1,300 years. Many interactions, including financial support, religious leadership positions, and marriages have taken place between the various Karaite communities, including those in Egypt, Turkey, Jerusalem and Crimea.

A split emerged within the Karaite community of Egypt around the turn of the 20th century, between those now termed &quot;progressives&quot; and those termed &quot;traditionalists&quot;. The progressives, of which noted writer and intellectual Murat Faraj Lisha‘ was at the forefront, called for a more liberal interpretation of &quot;Halakha&quot;, along with societal reforms and greater solidarity with Rabbanites. The traditionalists were led by Chief &quot;Hakham&quot; Tubiah ben Simhah Levi Babovich, and called not only for a more obdurate interpretation, but for greater separatism from both Rabbanites and Zionism. Although Babovich was respected for his dedication towards the community, his conservatism and opposition towards local customs met with little success.

In the 1950s, the entire Jewish population in Egypt was estimated at 80,000 including 5,000 Karaite Jews. Following the United Arab Republic&#x27;s participation in the Six-Day War, Jewish men in Egypt were placed in short term detention, before being expelled from the country. This resulted in the near 
complete disappearance of the Jewish and Karaite communities by the 1970s. Karaites were among the last to leave and most of Egypt&#x27;s Karaite Jews settled in Israel.

The latest Chief Karaite sages of the Karaite community in Egypt (החכמים הראשיים הקראים) were:

# Hakham Moshe El-Kodsi (1856–1872)
# Hakham Shlomo Ben Afeda Ha-Kohen (1873–1875)
# Hakham Shabbatai Mangoubi (1876–1906)
# Hakham Aharon Kefeli (1907)
# Hakham Brakhah Ben Itshaq Kohen (1908–1915)
# Hakham Abraham Kohen (1922–1933)
# Hakham Tubiah ben Simhah Levi Babovich (1934–1956)

From 1916 to 1921, due to World War I, there was no Chief sage in Egypt.

==Beliefs==
===Core tenets===
The oldest Karaite articles of faith were formulated by the 12th century scholar and liturgist Judah ben Elijah Hadassi in his &quot;Eshkol ha-Kofer&quot;:
===Karaite interpretations of the Torah===
Karaite Jews do not object to the idea of a body of interpretation of the Torah, along with extensions and development of non-rabbinic &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) that strives to adhere to the Tanakh&#x27;s straightforward meaning. Several hundred such books have been written by various Karaite &quot;Ḥakhamim&quot; (sages) throughout the movement&#x27;s history, although most are lost today. The disagreement arises over the rabbinic tradition&#x27;s raising of the Talmud and the other writings of the rabbis above the Torah. The Karaites believe this has led to traditions and customs being kept under rabbinic law that contradict what is written in the Torah. The Karaites also have their own traditions and customs passed down from their ancestors and religious authorities. These are known as &quot;Sevel HaYerushah&quot;, which means &quot;the Yoke [or burden] of Inheritance.&quot; Most of these practices are kept primarily by traditional Karaites; theoretically, any tradition thereof is said to be rejected if it contradicts the simple meaning of the Tanakh&#x27;s text. The vast majority of these traditions are not forced upon any Karaite Jew or convert to Judaism through the Karaite movement, except very few such as donning a head covering in the Karaite &quot;kenesa&quot;.

Those Karaites Jews who are new to the Karaite lifestyle do not have such an inheritance or tradition and tend to rely solely upon the Tanakh and those practices mentioned in it, and to adapt Biblical practices to their cultural context. Karaite communities are so small and generally isolated, that their members commonly adopt the customs of their host country. In Israel, too, traditional Karaites tend to be culturally assimilated into mainstream society (both secular and Orthodox).

Many modern Karaite Jews have emerged from the Karaite revival of the late 20th century; the World Karaite Movement was founded by Nehemia Gordon and &quot;Ḥakham&quot; Meir Rekhavi in the early 1990s. Karaite Jewish University (KJU), approved by the &quot;Mo‘eṣet HaḤakhamim&quot; (the Council of Sages) in Israel, was founded to teach an introductory course on Karaite Judaism. It could lead to a student&#x27;s conversion by a &quot;Beit Din&quot; (religious Jewish court) authorized by the &quot;Mo‘eṣet HaḤakhamim&quot;. KJU teaches various forms of Karaite Judaism and includes &quot;Sevel HaYerushah&quot; in its course materials. Thus, newly admitted converts to Karaite Judaism can choose to accept or reject Sevel HaYerushah.

===Shabbat===
As with other Jews, during Shabbat, Karaites attend synagogue to worship and to offer prayers. Most Karaites refrain from sexual relations on that day since they maintain that engaging in them can cause fatigue and copulation, in particular, results in ritual impurity on this holy day, concerns that Rabbinic Judaism ceased to have long ago; additionally, impregnating one&#x27;s wife is considered &quot;melakha&quot; (forbidden work). Their prayer books are composed almost completely of biblical passages. Karaite Jews often practice full prostration during prayers, while most other Jews no longer pray in this fashion.

Unlike Rabbinic Jews, Karaites do not practice the ritual of lighting Shabbat candles. They have a differing interpretation of the Torah verse, &quot;You shall not [burn] (Hebrew: &quot;bi‘er&quot; the &quot;pi‘el&quot; form of &quot;ba‘ar&quot;) a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of Shabbat.&quot; (Ex. 35:3) In Rabbinic Judaism, the &quot;qal&quot; verb form &quot;ba‘ar&quot; is understood to mean &quot;burn&quot;, whereas the &quot;pi‘el&quot; form (present here) is understood to be, not intensive as usual but causative, the rule being that the pi‘el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif‘il. Hence &quot;bi‘er&quot; means &quot;kindle&quot;, which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits &quot;starting&quot; a fire on Shabbat. The vast majority of Karaite Jews hold that, throughout the Tanakh, &quot;ba‘ar&quot; explicitly means &quot;to burn&quot;, while the Hebrew word meaning &quot;to ignite&quot; or &quot;to kindle&quot; is &quot;hidliq&quot;. Accordingly, the mainstream in Karaite Judaism takes the passage to mean that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. However, the minority of Karaites who view the prohibition to be on kindling a fire often permit a fire to continue burning into the Sabbath.

Historically, Karaites refrained from using or deriving benefit from fire until the Sabbath ends, and accordingly their homes were not lit during the night of the Sabbath. Many modern Karaites today use a fluorescent or LED lamp powered by batteries, which is turned on prior to Shabbat. Many observant Karaites either unplug their refrigerators on Shabbat or turn off the circuit breakers. Karaites consider producing electricity to be a violation of Shabbat, no matter who produces it. Additionally, some Karaites view the purchasing of electricity that is charged on an incremental basis during the Shabbat as a commercial transaction that the Tanakh prohibits, no matter when the payment is made; the recording of the electric meter is considered by them to be a commercial transaction.

===Laws of ritual purity===
Karaites maintain that in the absence of a Temple, ordinary washing with flowing waters (described in the Torah as &quot;living&quot;—flowing—water) should be substituted for purification with water that includes ashes obtained through the red heifer burning ritual. Karaites believe that this was the practice before the Tabernacle was built in the Sinai Peninsula following the Exodus. They follow certain Torah laws for avoiding &quot;Ṭum’at Met&quot; (ritual impurity caused by contact with a dead body, human bones, graves, or being present in a space under any ceiling where a human died) which are no longer considered relevant in Rabbinic Judaism, except for Kohanim (members of the Jewish priestly class).

===Sephirath Ha‘Omer and Shavu‘oth===
The Karaite method of counting the days from the offering of the ‘Omer is different from the rabbinic method. The Karaites understand the term &quot;morrow after the Sabbath&quot; in Leviticus 23:15–16 to refer to the weekly Sabbath, whereas Rabbinic Judaism interprets it as referring to the day of rest on the first day of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot. So while Rabbinic Judaism begins the count on the 16th of Nisan and celebrates Shavu‘ot on the 6th of Sivan, Karaite Jews count from the day after the weekly Sabbath (i.e., the Sunday) that occurs during the seven days of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot to the day after the seventh weekly Sabbath. They celebrate Shavu‘ot on that Sunday, no matter what the calendar date of that Sunday on which it happens to fall.

===Tzitzit (Ṣiṣiyot)===

A Tzitzit (alternatively spelled Ṣiṣit, plural: Tzitziyot or Ṣiṣiyot) is a knotted or braided tassel worn by observant Jews (both Karaite and Rabbinic) on each of the four corners of what is often an outer garment or their Tallit. The Torah commands Israel to make tassels on the corners of their four-cornered garment containing a thread of &quot;Tekhelet&quot; () and repeats this commandment using the word for &quot;twisted cords&quot; (&quot;Gedilim&quot;) instead of &quot;tassels&quot; at . The purpose of the tassels is stated in the Book of Numbers as a visual reminder to the Israelites to remember the commandments given by God.

The thread of Tekhelet is a blue-violet or blue thread, which, according to the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism, is to be dyed with a specific kind of dye derived from a mollusc (notably the &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot; sea snail). Due to a number of factors, including Rome outlawing the use of Tekhelet by commoners, the source and practice of using a Tekhelet thread in Tzitzit was lost for most Rabbinic Jews. Their Tzitziyot are usually all white. Karaite Jews believe that the importance of Tekhelet is that the color of thread is blue-violet and it may be produced from any source, including synthetic industrial dyes, except impure (a state mostly overlapping unkosher) marine creatures, rather than insist on a specific dye. Therefore, they believe that the rabbinic tradition of relying on a dye from a mollusc is incorrect. They suggest that the source of the dye was indigo or &quot;Isatis tinctoria&quot;.

Rabbinic Jews have specific traditions on how the tassels are to be knotted. Karaite Jews, for their part, have certain traditions on the manner of braiding the tassels, although they are not binding. Consequently, the way the &quot;Tzitziyot&quot; are made usually distinguishes Karaite &quot;Tzitziyot&quot; from rabbinic &quot;Tzitziyot&quot;.

===Tefillin===
Karaite Jews do not wear tefillin in any form. According to Karaites, the Biblical passages cited for this practice are metaphorical, and mean to &quot;remember the Torah always and treasure it&quot;. This is because the commandment in scripture is &quot;And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart&quot;... &quot;And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for forehead ornaments between thine eyes&quot;. (Deuteronomy 6:5,9) Since words cannot be on one&#x27;s heart, or bound on one&#x27;s hand, the entire passage is understood metaphorically. Furthermore, the same expressions (&quot;And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand&quot; as well as &quot;and they shall be as frontal ornaments between thine eyes&quot;) are used in Exodus 13:9 in reference to the commandments of Ḥagh HaMaṣṣot, in Exodus 13:16 in reference to the ritual of redeeming the first born, in Deuteronomy 6:8 in reference to the ‘Aseret HaDevarim (the Ten Utterances, usually mistranslated as &quot;the Ten Commandments&quot;), and in Deuteronomy 11:18 in reference to all the words of the Torah, indicating that, from a Karaite perspective, they must be metaphorical in nature (because one could never ritually &quot;write&quot; and &quot;bind&quot; upon their hearts themselves).

===Marriage===
Marriage among Karaite Jews is not unlike that among Rabbanites. One notable difference being there is no restriction on polygyny within Karaite Judaism. This is increasingly rare in the modern day, however, and the ability of the husband to take other wives hinged, not only on his ability to equally fulfill his duties to them, but also the acceptance of the act by the primary wife. The primary wife is well within her rights to include an anti-polygamy clause in their betrothal contract.

===Mezuzot===
Like Tefillin, Karaites interpret the scripture that mandates inscribing the Law on doorposts and city gates as a metaphorical admonition, specifically, to keep the Law at home and away. This is because the previous commandment in the same passage is the source for Tefillin for Rabbinic Judaism, and is understood metaphorically due to the language. As a result, the entire passage is understood as a metaphor. Therefore, they do not put up mezuzot, although many Karaite Jews do have a small plaque with the Ten Commandments on their doorposts.

However, a Christian account in the 19th century tells of a Karaite synagogue in Constantinople that reportedly had a mezuzah. In Israel, in an effort to make Rabbinic Jews comfortable, many Karaite Jews do put up mezuzot, but not out of belief that it is commanded.

===Mamzerim===
In both Deuteronomy 23:3, and Zechariah 9:6, the Hebrew word &quot;mamzer&quot; is referenced alongside the nations of Ammon and Moab (in Deut 23:3), and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod (in Zech 9:5–6). From such, Karaites have come to consider the most logical understanding of the Hebrew word &quot;mamzer&quot;, which modern Rabbinical Jews understand to refer to either children born from adultery or from incest (Talmud Bavli, Masekhet Yevamot), to actually speak of a nation or people. Karaites think that such an understanding fits perfectly into the context of both Deuteronomy 23 and Zechariah 9, (and this was also the understanding of the Rabbinist commentator Yehudah ben Shemu’el ibn Bil‘am). Several Medieval Rabbinite Jewish sages felt it necessary to debate this topic with Medieval Karaite Jewish sages.

===Four species===
Karaite Judaism defines the Four species (&quot;Arba`at haMinim&quot;) somewhat differently than Rabbinic Jews, i.e. (1) fruit of splendorous tree (&quot;Peri `Eṣ Hadar&quot;), which need not be the Etrog (yellow citrus fruit) demanded by rabbinic law, yet may be either any seasonal fruit tree considered splendorous by an individual Jew, or branches of olive trees featuring the olives, that were considered splendorous by the Judean Israelites in the generation of Nehemiah, as seen in Neḥemyah 8; (2) date palm fronds (&quot;Kappoth Temarim&quot;) instead of the closed palm frond used by Rabbinic Jews; (3) branches of thickly leaved trees (&quot;‘Eṣ ‘Avoth&quot;) which may be from fig, laurel and eucalyptus rather than myrtle branches only; and (4) willow branches (&quot;‘Aravoth Naḥal&quot;) e.g. maple, oak, yew and butternut, as opposed to the rabbinically dictated willow tree&#x27;s boughs. Karaite Jews have always understood the &quot;Arba`at haMinim&quot; to be used for the purpose of constructing the roof of the Sukkah (pl. &quot;Sukkot&quot;); they are not made into a &quot;lulav&quot; and shaken in six directions, as is the rabbinic practice. In the Book of Nehemiah (8:15), the Israelites are instructed to construct their Sukkot out of the four species: olive branches and oil tree branches (fruit of splendorous tree), as well as date palm fronds, myrtle branches and branches of thickly leaved trees are mentioned in the same passage as materials for the Sukkah&#x27;s construction.
===Who is a Jew / Karaite?===

Most Karaites follow patrilineal descent, meaning a Jew is either someone whose father is Jewish (since almost all Jewish descent in the Tanakh is traced patrilineally) or both of whose parents are Jews, or one who has undergone a formal conversion which entails circumcision for uncircumcised males and formally accepting the God of Israel as one&#x27;s own God and the people of Israel as one&#x27;s own people.

In contrast, Eastern European Karaites traditionally believe both parents must be Karaites for an individual to be considered a Karaite.

=== Conversion ===
Historically, Karaite communities have both accepted and rejected the concept of giyyur. From 1465 until 2007, Egyptian Karaite communities had a ban on the acceptance of gentile converts. Rabbinical Jews, however, were not required to convert, rather they affiliate with a community or choose to follow Karaism.

Egyptian Karaites believe that conversion to the Jewish people should be done after living among Jews (preferably Karaite) in the form of a vow (the dominant position among modern Karaites maintains that this oath should be taken before a Karaite Beit Din whose members act on the behalf of the Israeli Council of Sages); see Exodus 12:43–49, Ruth 1:16, Esther 8:17, and Isaiah 56:1–8 and studying the Tanakh. Also Ezekiel the prophet states that &quot;gerim&quot; (&quot;sojourners&quot;) who have joined themselves to the Children of Israel will be given land inheritance among the tribes of Israel among whom they live during the final Redemption.

Eastern European Karaite communities consider Karaism to be a separate ethno-religion entirely and mostly reject conversion, though there have historically been exceptions. In early 20th century Harbin, after the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II, a local Karaite community begin to accept gentile converts after they were inspired by the dubious claim of a mass Khazar conversion to Karaism. Rabbinical Jews also had to convert to become Karaites in Eastern Europe, though this practice was notably rare.

===Pronouncing the Tetragrammaton===
In the Middle Ages, some, such as the Karaite Jews in Greater Khorasan, viewed pronouncing the Tetragrammaton as a mitzvah because the name appears some 6800 times throughout the Tanakh. Today, publicly uttering the Tetragrammaton is a controversial issue among Karaites. Virtually all traditional Karaites view the pronunciation of God&#x27;s name to be blasphemous, and adhere to the rabbinic tradition of substituting Adonai when coming across YHWH while reading. Other Karaites and some of those coming from a rabbinic background like Nehemia Gordon and &quot;Ḥakham&quot; Meir Rekhavi, as well as some joiners to the people of Israel through Karaite Judaism such as James Walker and Daniel ben Immanuel, do not consider the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton to be forbidden. There is, however, disagreement among scholars as to the correct pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton.

==Writings==
Karaism has produced a vast library of commentaries and polemics, especially during its &quot;Golden Age&quot;. These writings prompted new and complete defenses of the Mishnah and the Talmud, the culmination of these in the writings of Saadia Gaon and his criticisms of Karaism. Though he opposed Karaism, the rabbinic commentator Abraham ibn Ezra regularly quoted Karaite commentators, particularly Yefet ben Ali, to the degree that a legend exists among some Karaites that Ibn Ezra was ben Ali&#x27;s student.

The most well-known Karaite polemic is Yiṣḥaq ben Avraham of Troki&#x27;s &quot;Faith Strengthened&quot; (), a comprehensive counter-Christian missionary polemic, which was later translated into Latin by Johann Christoph Wagenseil as part of a larger collection of Jewish anti-Christian polemics entitled &quot;Tela Ignea Satanæ, sive Arcani et Horribiles Judæorum Adversus Christum, Deum, et Christianam Religionem Libri&quot; (Altdorf, 1681: &quot;The Fiery Darts of Satan, or the Arcane and Horrible Books of the Jews Against Christ, God, and the Christian Religion&quot;). Many counter-missionary materials produced today are based upon or cover the same themes as this book.

Scholarly studies of Karaite writings are still in their infancy, and owe greatly to the Firkovich collections of Karaite manuscripts in the National Library of Russia that have become accessible after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The cataloguing efforts of scholars at the Bibliothèque nationale de France and in the United States and England is continuing to yield new insights into Karaite literature and thought.

== Cuisine ==
Karaite cuisine exhibits a profound influence from Egyptian culinary traditions alongside notable Ottoman-Turkish and Persian elements. The influence of Egyptian cuisine is evident in the adoption of dishes such as &quot;tamiyya&quot; (Egyptian-style falafel), fava beans, and mulukhiyah stew. Ottoman-Turkish elements include &quot;baba ghanoush&quot; (termed &quot;baba nouga&quot; in Karaite cuisine), &quot;pastirma&quot;, &quot;muhallebi&quot; and &quot;kunafeh&quot;, which in Karaite tradition, is prepared with nuts rather than cheese, aligning with earlier renditions of the dessert. Indications of Persian influence may be seen in the preparation of &quot;keshk&quot;, a rice and greens dish.

Karaite cuisine features a unique noodle-making tradition, creating thin, handmade noodles called &quot;tigrinins&quot;, seasoned with a special Karaite za&#x27;atar blend that combines dried hyssop leaves and ground garlic, diverging from the more typical regional za&#x27;atar mix of hyssop, sumac and sesame. &quot;Matfunah&quot; is a type of frittata or quiche made with potatoes and onions, sometimes incorporating leftover Sabbath stew meat. The cuisine&#x27;s characteristic spice blend, &quot;makleef&quot;, includes allspice, white pepper, black pepper, nutmeg, roses, cinnamon, and cloves, contributing to the flavor profiles of Karaite dishes.

During the Festival of Matzot, as Karaites refer to Passover Eve, their observance is distinct: the Seder plate is absent, and blessings are specifically for &quot;matzot&quot;, &quot;maror&quot;, and grilled meat. The holiday&#x27;s basic menu typically features roasted meat prepared on the grill, a salad of bitter herbs using chicory leaves enhanced with lemon juice and zest, and homemade crispy flatbreads. While traditionally Karaites abstain from wine on Passover because it is a fermented product, changes due to secularization and intermarriage have led some within the community to include wine in their Passover celebration.

==Karaites, Aharon Ben Mosheh Ben Asher, and the Masoretic Text==
Aaron ben Moses ben Asher was a Jewish scholar from Tiberias, famous as the most authoritative of the Tiberian Masoretes, and a member of a family who had been involved in creating and maintaining the Masoretic Text (authoritative text of the Hebrew scripture), for at least five generations. His Tiberian vocalization of the Bible is still, for all intents and purposes, the text all Jews continue to use, and he was the first systematic Hebrew grammarian.

His &quot;Sefer Diqduqei HaTe‘amim&quot; (&quot;Grammar of the Punctuation/Vocalizations&quot;) was an original collection of grammatical rules and Masoretic information. Grammatical principles were not at that time considered worthy of independent study. The value of this work is that the grammatical rules presented by ben Asher reveal the linguistic background of vocalization for the first time. He had a tremendous influence on the world of Biblical criticism.

In the nineteenth century, certain scholars suggested that Aharon Ben Asher might have been a Karaite and not a Rabbinic Jew. Aharon Dothan has examined this issue from many angles, and his conclusion is that Ben Asher was a Rabbinic Jew, but Raphael Zer has raised this issue again and presented new evidence.

In 989, an unknown scribe of a former &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; manuscript vouched for the care with which his copy was written by claiming that he had vocalized and added the Masoretic text &quot;from the books that were vocalized by Aaron ben Moses Ben-Asher&quot;. Maimonides, by accepting the views of ben Asher in regard to open and closed sections, helped establish and spread his authority. &quot;The book on which we have relied for these matters is the book that is well-known in Egypt, which includes twenty-four books, which was in Jerusalem for many years for the purpose of proofreading books from it. Everybody relied on it since Ben-Asher proofread it and scrutinized it for years, and proofread many times as he copied it. I relied on it when I wrote a Sefer Torah properly&quot;.

==Karaites today==
Estimates of the size of the modern Karaite movement put the number at 1,500 Karaites in the United States, some 80 Constantinopolitan Karaites in Turkey, and around 30,000 in Israel, the largest communities being in Ramla, Ashdod and Beersheba. There are around 1,800 in Europe, primarily in Ukraine (with Crimea), which has about 800, 350 in Poland, 250 in Kazakhstan, 200 in Lithuania and 200 in Russia (without Crimea). Most of these communities have experienced serious decline in recent decades.

During the early 1920s, a British mandate official in Jerusalem records visiting the Karaite synagogue, which he describes as being &quot;small, mediaeval, semi-underground&quot; serving &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s tiny colony of Qaraites&quot;.

In the early 1950s, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel originally objected to the immigration of Karaite Jews to Israel, and unsuccessfully tried to obstruct it. In 2007, however, Rabbi David Ḥayim Chelouche, the chief rabbi of Netayana was quoted in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; as saying, &quot;A Karaite is a Jew. We accept them as Jews and every one of them who wishes to come back [to mainstream Judaism] we accept back. There was once a question about whether Karaites needed to undergo a token circumcision in order to switch to Rabbinic Judaism, but the rabbinate agrees that today that is not necessary.&quot;

Moshe Marzouk, one of the Egyptian Jews executed in 1954 for planting bombs in Cairo in the service of Israeli Military Intelligence (the Lavon Affair) was a Karaite. Marzouk was considered a hero in Israel; however, his Karaite identity was downplayed in newspapers, which usually just described him as an Egyptian Jew. However, in 2001, the Israeli government, through the Israel Postal Authority, issued a special memorial sheet honoring him and many other Karaite Jews that gave their lives for Israel.

In Israel, the Karaite Jewish leadership is directed by a group called Universal Karaite Judaism. Most of the members of its Board of &#x27;Ḥakhamim&#x27; are of Egyptian Jewish descent. The largest Karaite community today resides in Ashdod.

There are about 1,500 Karaites living in the United States. The Congregation B&#x27;nai Israel is located in Daly City, California, which is a suburb of San Francisco. It is the only Karaite synagogue in the United States with a permanent dedicated facility. The leaders of the congregation are of Egyptian Karaite extraction. One notable congregant, Mark Kheder, the synagogue&#x27;s treasurer, has described his internment in an Egyptian prisoner-of-war camp during the 1967 Six-Day war. The congregation&#x27;s acting &quot;Rav (Ḥakham&quot;), Joe Pessah, was also among those who were arrested by the Egyptian government. Another, much smaller congregation, Karaite Jewish Congregation Oraḥ Ṣaddiqim, exists in Albany, NY, but they have yet to find a permanent dedicated facility and, in the meantime, continue to use a room in the home of their &quot;Ḥakham&quot;, Avraham Ben-Raḥamiël Qanaï, as their temporary synagogue.

On 1 August 2007, some members of the first graduating class of Karaite Jewish University were converts, representing the first new officially authorized members into Karaite Judaism in 542 years. At a ceremony in its Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors joined the Jewish people by taking the same oath that Ruth took. The group&#x27;s course of study lasted over one year. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts. On 17 February 2009, the second graduating class of converts took the oath. This included 11 adults and 8 minors.

There are about 80 Karaites living in Istanbul, Turkey, where the only Karaite synagogue in Turkey, the &quot;Kahal haKadosh Bene Mikra&quot;, is still functional (on Shabbat and holy days) in the Hasköy neighborhood in the European part of the city.

In Poland, Karaites are a recognized minority, represented by the Association of Polish Karaites () and the Karaite Religious Association in the Polish Republic (). Karaites live primarily in and around Warsaw, Wrocław and Tricity; they are linguistically assimilated.

In Switzerland there is also a Karaite Jewish community: the Karaite Jews of Europe (KJE). This community is accepted by the Universal Karaite Judaism (UKJ) in Israel and the Karaite Jews of America (KJA), its members are also recognized as Jews by the Israeli State. Aliyah to Israel is also possible for converts. The community follows the traditional Egyptian-style rite. In Eglisau, a small community center with a prayer- room is run and is supported by Hakham Meir Yosef Rekhavi. The Karaite Jewish University is maintained together with the KJA and UKJ.

In 2016, the Religious Council of Karaite Jews unanimously reelected their chief rabbi, Rabbi Moshe Firrouz, for another four-year term. Firrouz has been serving as chief rabbi since 2011.

==Karaism in Rabbinic Jewish opinion==
Rabbinic Judaism&#x27;s scholars, such as Maimonides, write that people who deny the divine authority of the Oral Torah are to be considered among the heretics. However, at the same time, Maimonides holds (&quot;Hilkhot Mamrim&quot; 3:3) that most of the Karaites and others who claim to deny the &quot;oral teachings&quot; are not to be held accountable for their errors in the law because they are led into error by their parents and are similar to a tinok shenishba (a captive baby), or to one who was forced.

Rabbinic scholars have traditionally held that, because the Karaites do not observe the rabbinic law on divorce, there is a strong presumption that they are mamzerim (adulterine bastards), so that marriage with them is forbidden even if they return to Rabbinic Judaism. Some recent Ashkenazi Ḥaredi scholars have held that Karaites should be regarded as Gentiles in all respects, though this is not universally accepted. They hasten to add that this opinion is not intended to insult the Karaites, but only to give individual Karaites the option of integrating into mainstream Judaism by way of conversion. In contrast, in 1971, Ovadia Yosef, who was then the Chief Rabbi of the Sefaradim and ‘Edot HaMizraḥ of Israel, proclaimed that Egyptian Karaites are Jews and that it is permissible for Rabbinic Jews to marry with them.

In response to the position taken by the Karaites in regards to the authority of the Talmud, Orthodox Judaism counters first that the majority of the Oral Law codified in the Mishnah and Talmud are the legal rulings of the last Sanhedrin, a body of 71 elders that made up the highest court of jurisprudence in ancient Israel, and that not all of the Oral Law are literally &quot;Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai&quot;. The decisions made by this High Court must be upheld, per se the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 17), this gives their legal rulings divine authority. Karaites reject the authority of this Sanhedrin that developed during the second Temple period partly because it was an admixture of different people and not just priests and levites as mandated by the Torah. The Sanhedrin also took legal authority away from the descendants of Zadok who served as priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. This is essentially the same view held by the Sadducees and Boethusians during the second Temple period. Secondly, Rabbinic Judaism points to the innumerable examples of biblical commandments that are either too ambiguous or documented in such a concise fashion that proper adherence could not be enforced on a national scale without the further legislation provided by the Talmud. Karaites respond that the Torah itself states &quot;this law I am commanding you is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, to say, who shall ascend into the heavens and bring it to us, and cause us to understand it, that we do it?&quot; indicating the Torah could easily be understood by the average Israelite. Examples cited in Rabbinic Judaism as laws requiring rabbinic explanation include:
*Tefillin: As indicated in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin are to be placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes. However, there are no details provided regarding what tefillin are or how they are to be constructed. Karaites, however, argue that since other passages in the Tanakh with similar language are read metaphorically, the verses from which the Rabbis derive the law of tefillin should also be read metaphorically.
*Kashrut laws: As indicated in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a kid may not be boiled in its mother&#x27;s milk. In addition to numerous other problems with understanding the ambiguous nature of this law, there are no vowelization characters in the Torah; they are provided by the Masoretic tradition. This is particularly relevant to this commandment, as the Hebrew word for &quot;milk&quot; is identical to the word for &quot;fat&quot; when vowels are absent. Without the oral tradition, it is not known whether the violation is in mixing meat with milk or with fat. Karaites maintain the vowels of the text have been preserved by the Masoretes who themselves were Karaites.
*Shabbat laws: With the severity of Sabbath violation, namely the death penalty, one would assume that direction would be provided as to how exactly such a serious and core commandment should be upheld. However, there is little to no information as to what can and cannot be performed on the Sabbath. Karaites, nonetheless, do keep the Shabbat according to their own traditions and interpretations, as described in the section above.
*Mezuzah: Deuteronomy 6:9 is sometimes interpreted to mean that a mezuzah needs to be placed on the doorposts of a house. However, there are no details regarding where on the doorpost, if it is all doorposts or just one, what words go in it, how the words should be written or how the mezuzah should be constructed. As with the passage from which the rabbis derive the tradition of tefillin, Karaites state this passage is also intended to be understood metaphorically and not literally.

Orthodox Judaism also notes that the Torah was never meant to be observed as a personal covenant between the individual Jew and God, but a national covenant wherein the Torah functions as the constitution of Israel as a whole. Orthodox Jews point out that the Torah could never be enforced as a national law, as it was during the time of Joshua, King David, and Ezra, if every individual Jew had their own opinion on how to observe its commandments. In order for the Torah to properly govern the Jewish people, and for its laws be legally enforced with the punishments and penalties prescribed in the Torah, those laws must be legislated and clearly defined by a ruling Sanhedrin. Karaites counter that the enforcement of the Torah on a national scale can only be legislated by the descendants of Zadok in the Temple in Jerusalem as per the Torah (Deuteronomy 17) and prophets (Ezekiel 44), not by a collection of opinions by various rabbis.

For Karaites, in sum, the rabbinic interpretations above, as codified in oral law, are only one form of interpretation. They are not divinely ordained, and they are neither binding halakhah nor practical religious law.

===Rabbinical classification of a Jew===
The child of a Karaite mother is regarded as halakhically Jewish by the Orthodox Rabbinate. By contrast, somebody who is patrilineally Jewish (one whose father is Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the &quot;Mo′eṣet HaḤakhamim&quot; (the Karaite Council of Sages) on the condition that they were raised Jewish during childhood. Although it is widely accepted that Karaite Jews are halakhically Jewish (apparently with the exception of those who join the Jewish people through the Karaite movement), there is still a question as to whether or not marriage between the Karaite and Rabbinite communities is permitted. Two Sephardi chief rabbis, Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron and Ovadia Yosef encouraged such marriages, hoping it would help Karaites to assimilate into mainstream Judaism. Maimonides decreed that Jews raised in a Karaite household are considered to be &quot;Tinoq she&#x27;Nishba&quot;, like babies taken captive by non-Jews; they cannot be punished for their supposedly wayward behavior, because it is the result of their parents&#x27; influence.

In 2013, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported, &quot;rabbis working for Israel&#x27;s ministry of religion deemed Karaite marriages invalid, fined their butchers for claiming to be kosher, and demanded that Karaites marrying Orthodox Jewish women should convert, sometimes having to undergo tavila, or baptism.&quot; The chief rabbinate&#x27;s spokesman told &quot;The Economist&quot; that &quot;Israel is a Jewish state and Jews have superior rights. But the Karaites are not Jewish.&quot; R. Moshe Firrouz, head of the Karaites&#x27; Council of Sages, protested, saying that &quot;the rabbinate is denying us our religious freedom.&quot;

<doc id="642161" wikidata="Q320618" url="?curid=642161" title="Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi">
<text>Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, (29 January 1873 – 18 March 1933) was an Italian mountaineer and explorer, briefly Infante of Spain as son of Amadeo I of Spain, member of the royal House of Savoy and cousin of the Italian King Victor Emmanuel III. He is known for his Arctic explorations and for his mountaineering expeditions, particularly to Mount Saint Elias and K2. He also served as an Italian admiral during World War I. He created Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi in Italian Somalia during his last years of life.

==Early years==
He was born in Madrid, Spain as the third oldest son of Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta and his first wife Donna Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo della Cisterna. Prince Luigi Amedeo was a grandson of King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy. He was born during his father&#x27;s brief reign as King Amadeo of Spain. His siblings are Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Prince Vittorio Emanuele, and Prince Umberto. Shortly after his birth, his father, who had reigned in Spain since 1870, abdicated and returned to Italy in 1873. Prince Luigi Amedeo was a member of the House of Savoy, well known in Europe since the 12th century. His uncle became King Umberto I of Italy in 1878, and his cousin became King Vittorio Emanuele III in 1900.

The title Duke of the Abruzzi (Italian: &quot;Duca degli Abruzzi&quot;) was created by King Umberto I in 1890 for Luigi Amedeo, who was a son of the abdicating King of Spain Amadeus and initially was given the title of Infante of Spain. His ducal title referred to the central Italian region of Abruzzo.

From 1893 to 1896, Luigi Amedeo traveled around the world, including Eritrea, then an Italian possession, and Vancouver. In September 1893, he traveled to Italian Somaliland to quell the unrest and stayed for a month to guard the port of Mogadishu, giving him his first contact with a land to which he would later devote the last years of his life and in which he would choose to die. He had begun to train as a mountaineer in 1892 on Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa (Italian Alps): in 1897 he made the first ascent of Mount Saint Elias (Canada/U.S., 5,489 m). There the expedition searched for a mirage, known as the Silent City of Alaska, that natives and prospectors claimed to see over a glacier. C. W. Thornton, a member of the expedition, wrote: &quot;It required no effort of the imagination to liken it to a city, but was so distinct that it required, instead, faith to believe that it was not in reality a city.&quot;

==Arctic expedition==
In 1898, Prince Luigi Amedeo organized an expedition towards the North Pole and consulted the famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen that had sailed the furthest north with the Colin Archer-built polar ship in 1893–1896. In 1899 Amedeo acquired , a steam whaler of 570 tons. He renamed her &quot;Stella Polare&quot; and took her to Colin Archer&#x27;s shipyard in Larvik, Norway. The interior was stripped out and beams, diagonals and knees heavily strengthened the ship.

In the spring of 1899 he arrived in the Norwegian capital Christiania with ten companions and &quot;Stella Polare&quot; (&quot;Pole Star&quot;) took the expedition through the frozen sea. On 12 June they headed for Archangel (Arkhangelsk).

On 30 June &quot;Stella Polare&quot; dropped anchor in the docks of Arkhangelsk and the duke was solemnly received by Governor Engelhardt. The same day, Prince Luigi Amedeo was invited to meet the local authorities and the present foreign diplomats.

On 7 July, a local newspaper wrote:

:The city theatre arranged an extraordinary spectacle in the presence of the Duke of the Abruzzi. The drama &quot;The princess of Baghdad&quot;, consisting of three acts, was performed. Before the curtain was raised the orchestra had played the Italian royal anthem...

Later the duke himself wrote about his stay in Arkhangelsk: &quot;Our departure was set for July 12. Early in the morning the church was open to us and we, although being Catholic, were allowed to join the mass. In the afternoon all the dogs were brought back on board to their kennels. In the evening the &quot;Stella Polare&quot; put out and was escorted by two steamers down the Dvina. I still remained on shore, as well as Doctor Cavalli, in order to spend the evening together with our Italian friends. Next evening we left Arkhangel’sk. During the whole journey we saw flags being hoisted to welcome us...&quot;

Twenty men took part in the expedition, among them Captain Umberto Cagni, Lieutenant F. Querini and Doctor A. Cavalli Molinelli. They planned to go to Franz Joseph Land, in the Arctic wilderness, to establish a camp in which to stay during winter time and, afterwards, to reach the North Pole by dogsled across the frozen sea.

Prince Luigi Amedeo established the winter camp on Rudolf Island. The expedition was to start at the end of the Arctic night. The duke lost two fingers during winter because of the cold, which made it impossible for him to join the trip by sledge. He left the command over the pole expedition to Captain Cagni. On 11 March 1900, Cagni left the camp and reached latitude 86° 34’ on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen&#x27;s result of 1895 by . Cagni barely managed to return to the camp on 23 June. On 16 August &quot;Stella Polare&quot; left Rudolf Island heading south and the expedition returned to Norway. During the expedition, the northern coast of Rudolf Island and two other islands were explored and measured.
==Later years==
In 1906, inspired by Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s last wishes, the Duke led an expedition to the Ruwenzori Range (5,125 m), in Uganda. He scaled sixteen summits in the range, including the six principal peaks. One of them, Mount Luigi di Savoia, bears his name. The highest peak was reached on 18 June 1906.

His next great expedition, in 1909, aimed to climb K2 in Karakoram. A team led by Prince Luigi Amedeo reached a height of 6,250 m on the ridge. The standard route up the mountain (formerly known as K2&#x27;s East Ridge) climbs today on the Abruzzi Spur.

In an attempt on Chogolisa he and his companions again failed to reach the summit, but set a world altitude record, a height of approximately 7,500 m (24,600 ft) before turning around just 150 m below the summit due to bad weather.

=== In the Italian Navy ===

A vice-admiral in the Italian Royal Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;), he was Inspector of Torpedo Craft from 1911 to 1912. During World War I, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Fleet (1914–1917) based in Taranto, his flagship being the . Under the duke, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; was responsible for saving the Army of the Kingdom of Serbia. In February 1917, he was replaced by Paolo Thaon di Revel, under pressure from the British and French allies. In February 1918, he was promoted to admiral, but played no further role of importance.

The Explorers Club in New York elected the duke to its highest category of membership — Honorary Member — in 1912.

The duke assisted Italian dictator Benito Mussolini with the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928. He traveled to Addis Ababa with gifts. One gift, a Fiat 3000 tank, ended up playing a role in crushing the abortive &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 1928.

In 1932, the duke was briefly the president of the newly merged Italian Line of steamships. In 1931, combining all of Italy&#x27;s transatlantic carriers into the Italian Line was one of Mussolini&#x27;s biggest business deals. However, the duke resigned soon after broke down at Gibraltar. According to him, &quot;My reason is that I have been unable to achieve harmony among executives who formerly headed competing lines.&quot;

===Italian Somaliland===
In 1918, the Duke returned to Italian Somaliland. In 1920, he founded the &quot;Village of the Duke of Abruzzi&quot; (&quot;Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi&quot; or &quot;Villabruzzi&quot;) some ninety kilometres north of Mogadishu. It was an agricultural settlement experimenting with new cultivation techniques.

By 1926, the colony comprised 16 villages, with 3,000 Somali and 200 Italian (Italian Somalis) inhabitants. Abruzzi raised funds for a number of development projects in the town, including roads, dams, schools, hospitals, a church and a mosque.

He died in the village on 18 March 1933.

In the late 1930s, the village area was one of the most socio-economically developed in eastern Africa. The area around the &quot;Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi&quot; was the most agriculturally developed of Somalia before World War II and had some important food industries.

After Italian Somaliland was officially dissolved in 1947, the town was later renamed to Jowhar.

==Personal life==

In the early years of the twentieth century, Abruzzi was in a relationship with Katherine Hallie &quot;Kitty&quot; Elkins, daughter of the wealthy American senator Stephen Benton Elkins, but Abruzzi&#x27;s cousin King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy refused to grant him permission to marry a commoner. His brother, Emanuele Filiberto, to whom Luigi was very close, persuaded him to give up the relationship. His brother later approved of young Antoinette &quot;Amber&quot; Brizzi, the daughter of Quinto Brizzi, one of the largest vineyard owners in Northern Italy. Despite this, Abruzzi was never officially married; however, in the later years of his life, Abruzzi had a relationship and deep romantic partnership with Faduma Ali, a young Somali woman who stayed by his side even while he was on his deathbed.

<doc id="642163" wikidata="Q34205" url="?curid=642163" title="Cockburn Town">
<text>Cockburn Town ( ) is the capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands, spreading across most of Grand Turk Island. It was founded in 1681 by salt collectors.

==Geography==
Cockburn Town is located on the largest island in the Turks Islands archipelago, Grand Turk. Historic 18th and 19th century Bermudian architecture lines Duke and Front Streets in the town. The town is known for its long, narrow streets and old street lamps.

The closest anchorage to Cockburn Town is Hawk&#x27;s Nest Anchorage, which, though sheltered, should only be entered in good light because of reefs near the entrance.

==History==
The seat of government ever since 1766, Cockburn Town was the first permanent settlement on any of the islands, founded in 1681 by salt collectors who arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The city supposedly lies on the place where Juan Ponce de León first landed on the island. It is named for Francis Cockburn, former Governor of the Bahamas.

==Main sights==

===National Museum===
Cockburn Town is home to the Turks &amp; Caicos National Museum, which is housed in the colonial-era Guinep House, on Front Street. The house is believed to be over 180 years old and much of its structural material came from local shipwrecks, including a ship&#x27;s mast, which is one of the building&#x27;s main supports. The site was donated to the Museum in 1990.

Among the National Museum&#x27;s collections is an exhibit of shipwrecks, including the oldest known European shipwreck in the Americas, the Molasses Reef Wreck, dated 1505.

Other exhibits detail the history of the Lucayans, the Space Race, Turks and Caicos postage stamps, slavery and the history of the slave trade, the sisal and salt industries, royal events, as well as a general history of the islands. The museum also maintains a garden, which is adjacent to the Guinep House.

Also of interest are the museum&#x27;s research projects, including its Message in a Bottle Project, recording nearly 40 years&#x27; worth of messages to wash upon the shores of Grand Turk.

===Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison===
&quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison&quot; on Pond Street was built in the 1830s and remained in operation until 1994. In addition to the main cell block and offices for prison officials, it hosts a bell tower and its own museum.

== Climate ==
Grand Turk has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with summer-like weather occurring all year round and a rainier season from September to December when the northeastern trade winds are strongest and hurricanes common.
==Education==
The sole high school is HJ Robinson High School.

<doc id="642168" wikidata="Q1326180" url="?curid=642168" title="Plaistow tube station">
<text>Plaistow ( or ) is a London Underground station on Plaistow Road in the London Borough of Newham in Greater London. It is on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines between West Ham and Upton Park stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 3.

==History==
The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway direct line from Bow to Barking was constructed east to west through the middle of the Parish of West Ham in 1858. Before this, trains took a longer route to the north via Stratford and Forest Gate on the Eastern Counties Railway&#x27;s line. The new line opened with stations initially at Bromley, Plaistow and East Ham. Upton Park was added as a new station to the east in 1877 and West Ham was added to the west in 1901. From 18 May 1869 the North London Railway ran a daily service to Plaistow via the Bow–Bromley curve, terminating at the northern bay platform. In 1905 the service switched to a new bay platform on the southern side. The North London Railway service to Plaistow ceased on 1 January 1916.

With the completion of the Whitechapel and Bow Railway in 1902 the line was doubled to four tracks and through services of the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) were able to operate to Upminster. The District Railway converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to East Ham. The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and became known as the District line.

The 1947 timetable shows only a few services a day on the main lines and a frequent service provided by the District line. The remaining Fenchurch Street–Southend services were withdrawn in 1962 when the LT&amp;SR route was electrified with overhead lines.

Ownership of the station passed to the Midland Railway in 1912 and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways. In 1969 ownership was transferred to the London Underground.

==Design==
The station has three platforms in use, comprising two through platforms and a third bay platform enabling eastbound trains to terminate and reverse back to central London. Two other platforms used to serve the LTSR line but are now closed and derelict; c2c trains pass through non-stop. Plaistow used to have sidings on the north side of the line, but the site is now derelict, having formerly been occupied by a Dagenham Motors car showroom.

The station booking hall, built in 1905, is the subject of a local listing which, while not conferring any additional planning controls on a building under current legislation, encourages the proper consideration of a building&#x27;s architectural or historic interest(s) in the exercise of normal planning controls.

==Works and engine sheds==
Plaistow railway works were built adjacent to the station on the north side of the line to the west of the station in 1879 to 1880. A separate engine shed was opened in 1899 adjoining the western end of the works. The locomotive works closed in 1925, with responsibility being transferred to Bow railway works which were a short distance away. Carriage and wagon work lasted until 1932 when that work was transferred to Wolverton railway works.

On 30 September 1911 a new depot—initially called &quot;West Ham&quot;—opened on the south side of the line and this became a Midland Railway depot in 1912 when the Midland Railway took over the London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) and then a London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) shed in 1923 following the grouping, when it was allocated the 13a depot code. Following nationalization in 1948 the depot was initially part of British Railways London Midland Region, although on 20 February 1949 it transferred to the Eastern Region. The depot code was changed to 33A which it retained until November 1959. From then until closure in 1962 it was a sub-shed of Tilbury (33B), then closed following electrification of the LTSR system.

In 1950 Plaistow had an allocation of 83 locomotives, the majority (70) of which were tank engines for passenger traffic to and from Fenchurch Street with 6 freight engines and 7 shunting engines making up the balance.

==Location==
Although there is no station car park, there is a Newham London Borough Council-run pay and display car park to the immediate south, connected by a set of steps. This was closed for neighbouring building works that were expected to run until 2023.

==Buses==
London Buses routes 69, 241, 262 and 473 serve the station.

<text>Peter H. Irons (born August 11, 1940) is an American political activist, civil rights attorney, legal scholar, and professor emeritus of political science. He has written many books on the U.S. Supreme Court and constitutional litigation.

== Education ==

Irons graduated from Antioch College (an early incubator of progressive politics).

He embarked on his current path in 1963 when he was sentenced to three years imprisonment at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut for refusing military induction on the ground that the Federal government perpetuated racial discrimination. While serving most of that sentence, he began corresponding with Howard Zinn, who sent him books on civil liberties and American politics. His conviction was ultimately reversed by a federal judge on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. Later, President Gerald Ford granted him a pardon for refusing induction.

== Career ==
Irons completed a PhD at Boston University in 1973. Afterwards, Zinn helped arrange for him to work at a law firm defending Daniel Ellsberg, who was under federal prosecution at the time for stealing the Pentagon Papers. His work at the law firm would later serve as motivation for him to pursue a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School, which he received in 1978.

Upon graduating, he taught at Boston College Law School and the University of Massachusetts before moving to the University of California, San Diego. There in 1982 he established the Earl Warren Bill of Rights Project, of which he is the director. He was chosen in 1988 as the first Raoul Wallenberg Distinguished Visiting Professor of Human Rights at Rutgers University. He has lectured on constitutional law and civil liberties at the law schools of Harvard, Yale, Berkeley, Stanford, and more than 20 other schools.

He was also elected to two terms on the national board of the American Civil Liberties Union.

In addition to teaching and authoring several books, he has also helped reopen the wartime internment cases of Fred Korematsu, Minoru Yasui, and Gordon Hirabayashi. Judge Marilyn Hall Patel heard the Korematsu case.

He is an Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego and an author on legal history. He retired from the university in 2004 and now devotes some of his time to causes that interest him. He has undertaken some legal work in issues of the separation of church and state and written some articles for the &quot;Montana Law Review&quot;.

Starting in 1989, Irons represented the plaintiffs in the Mount Soledad case in San Diego, pro bono. He discontinued his involvement in the case in 1998 when threats made him fear for the safety of his two daughters.

== Awards ==
* 1984 – Durfee Award
* 1986 – UCSD certificate of excellence
* 1989 – Ceil Podoloff Award by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)

<doc id="642171" wikidata="Q770496" url="?curid=642171" title="Mount Saint Elias">
<text>Mount Saint Elias (Was&#x27;eitushaa also designated Boundary Peak 186), the second-highest mountain in both Canada and the United States, stands on the Yukon and Alaska border about southwest of Mount Logan, the highest mountain in Canada. The Canadian side of Mount Saint Elias forms part of Kluane National Park and Reserve, while the U.S. side of the mountain is located within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.

== History and features ==

The name of the mountain in Tlingit, &quot;Yasʼéitʼaa Shaa&quot; or &quot;Was&#x27;eitushaa&quot;, means &quot;mountain behind Icy Bay&quot;; the YakutatTlingit occasionally call it &quot;Shaa Tlein&quot; &quot;Big Mountain&quot;. It is one of the most important crests of the Kwaashkʼiḵwáan clan, who used it as a guide during their journey down the Copper River. Mount Fairweather at the apex of the British Columbia and Alaska borders at the head of the Alaska Panhandle is known as &quot;Tsalx̱aan&quot;; legend states that this mountain and &quot;Yasʼéitʼaa Shaa&quot; (Mt. St. Elias) originally stood next to each other, but had an argument and separated. Their children, the mountains in between the two peaks, are called &quot;Tsalx̱aan Yátxʼi&quot; (&quot;Children of Tsalxaan&quot;).

European explorers first sighted the mountain on July 16, 1741, with the arrival of the expedition commanded by Vitus Bering, a Danish-born Russian explorer to what is now called Cape Saint Elias. While some historians contend that Bering named the mountain, others believe that eighteenth-century mapmakers named it after Cape Saint Elias when Bering left the peak unnamed.

Mount Saint Elias is notable for its immense vertical relief. Its summit rises vertically in just horizontal distance from the head of Taan Fjord, off of Icy Bay.

In 2007 Gerald Salmina directed an Austrian documentary film, &quot;Mount St. Elias&quot;, about a team of skier/mountaineers determined to make &quot;the planet&#x27;s longest skiing descent&quot; by ascending the mountain and then skiing nearly all 18,000 feet down to the Gulf of Alaska; the movie finished editing and underwent limited release in 2009. The climbers ended up summiting on the second attempt and skiing down to .

== Climbing history ==
Mt. St. Elias was first climbed on July 31, 1897, by an Italian expedition led by famed explorer Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, (who also reconnoitered the current standard route on K2 in 1909) and included noted mountain photographer Vittorio Sella.

The second ascent was not until 1946, when a group from the Harvard Mountaineering Club including noted mountain historian Dee Molenaar climbed the Southwest Ridge route. The summit party comprised Molenaar, his brother Cornelius, Andrew and Betty Kauffman, Maynard Miller, William Latady, and Benjamin Ferris. William Putnam was a member of the expedition but did not make the summit. They used eleven camps, eight of which were on the approach from Icy Bay, and three of which were on the mountain. They were supported by multiple air drops of food.

The first winter ascent was made on February 13, 1996, by David Briggs, Gardner Heaton and Joe Reichert. After being flown by pilots Steve Ranney and Gary Graham, in to on the Tyndall Glacier, they climbed the southwest ridge and followed the &quot;Milk Bowl&quot; variation in order to avoid 2,000 feet of loose rock on the normal route. The team had originally planned to begin their ascent from the ocean and cross the Tyndall Glacier but the terrain was in very poor condition.

Mount Saint Elias is infrequently climbed today, despite its height, because it has no easy route to the summit and because of its prolonged periods of bad weather (mainly snow and low visibility).

<doc id="642175" wikidata="Q2529946" url="?curid=642175" title="National Liberation Front of Tripura">
<text>The National Liberation Front of Tripura (abbreviated NLFT) was a banned Christian Tripuri nationalist militant organisation based in Tripura, India. It had an estimated 1500 members in 2001. 

The NLFT sought to secede from India and establish an independent Tripuri state and was an active participant in the Insurgency in Northeast India. 

The NLFT is currently designated as a terrorist organization in India.

== History ==
With the increased immigration of Bengalis from the Bangladesh and West Bengal in the aftermath of one of the worst ethnic riots, the NLFT was born in 1989 with the backing of the Baptist Church of Tripura. Since then, the NLFT has been advancing its cause through armed rebellion. In its constitution, the organization claims to represent the indigenous population which it claims has been marginalized by &quot;the subjugation policy of imperialist Hindustani (India)&quot;; its constitution makes no mention of any specific religion and claims to extend membership to &quot;any person irrespective of caste, sex or creed&quot;. However, some people who have left the NLFT, including former area commander Nayanbashi Jamatia, include animists who are Hindu and animists personal religions and faiths.

The NLFT has been described as engaging in terrorist violence motivated by their. The NLFT is listed as a terrorist organization in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. The state government contends that the Baptists of Tripura supply arms and give financial support to the NLFT. In April 2000, according to the state government, the secretary of the Noapara Freedom Front in Tripura, Nagmanlal Halam, was arrested with explosives and confessed that for two years he had been buying explosives for the NLFT. In 2000, the NLFT threatened to kill Hindus celebrating the religious festival of Durga Puja. At least 20 in Tripura have been killed in two years for resisting forced conversion to Christianity. A leader of the Jamatia tribe, Rampada Jamatia, said that armed NLFT militants were forcibly converting tribal villagers to Christianity which he said was a serious threat to peace These forcible conversions back to Christianity sometimes including the use of &quot;rape as a means of intimidation,&quot; were noted by academics outside of India in 2007.

In accordance with its stated goal of turning Tripura into the &quot;land of Tripura free of Bengalis&quot;, the NLFT has told tribal communities to do act cleansing Tripura from Bengalis. This has caused the Bengali, Jamatia tribesmen and the predominantly animist Reangs to oppose the NLFT.

On August 7, 1998, 4 senior leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were kidnapped by the NLFT, and all 4 of them are now said to be dead.

In early 2000, 16 Bengali Hindus were killed by the NLFT at Gourangatilla. On 20 May 2000, the NLFT killed 25 Bengali Hindus at the Bagber refugee camp. In August 2000, a tribal Hindu spiritual leader, Shanti Kali, was shot dead by about ten NLFT guerrillas who said it wanted to convert all people in the state to Christianity. In December 2000, Labh Kumar Jamatia, a religious leader of the state&#x27;s second largest Hindu group, was kidnapped by the NLFT, and found dead in a forest in Dalak village in southern Tripura. According to police, rebels from the NLFT wanted Jamatia to convert to Christianity, but he refused. A local Marxist tribal leader, Kishore Debbarma, was clubbed to death in Tripura&#x27;s Sadar by militants from the Biswamohan faction of the NLFT in May 2005.

In 2001, there were 826 reported terrorist attacks in Tripura, in which 405 people lost their lives and 481 kidnappings were made by the NLFT and related organizations such as the Christian All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTP). Nagmanlal Halam, secretary of the Noapara Baptist Church in Tripura, was arrested for and confessed, under torture from police, to providing munitions and financial aid to the NLFT from 1998 until 2000.

The BBC reported in 2005 that independent investigations as well as confessions from surrendered members showed that the NLFT had been making and selling pornography to finance their activities. This includes DVDs of pornographic films made by the group with tribal men and women kidnapped and forced to participate in sex acts while being filmed. The movies are dubbed into various languages and sold illegally throughout the region for a profit. Statements from former members and one report state that the NLFT has a history of sexually abusing tribal women.

According to the Institute for Conflict Management, approximately 90% of the NLFT&#x27;s attacks were against Bengali&#x27;s. 

==Factions==
The NLFT was originally started by Dhananjoy Reang, then vice chief Tripura National Volunteers On 12 March 1989 after disagreement with the tripartite agreement signed between TNV, Government of India and Government of Tripura. He initiated the formation of &quot;NLFT&quot; along with some other disgruntled TNV rebel leaders at Gandatwisa TRIPURA.

He sought the formation of armed wing of NLFT with the name NATIONAL HOLY ARMY in the year 1991 after launching operation Genesis at TAINANI Police station which led to the new phase of Tripuri nationalism which lasted over three decades. Dhananjoy Reang was removed from his position of PRESIDENT by an organised coup by his counterparts due to internal conflict in the year 1993.The group was then first led by Nayanbashi Jamatia and then Biswamohan Debbarma after the split occurred in 2002.

Cited causes of internal conflicts include the reluctance of Biswamohan Debbarma&#x27;s Central Executive Committee to nominate Joshua Debbarma as the King of ‘Tripura Kingdom’; misappropriation of funds by senior leaders; lavish lifestyles led by the senior leadership; and forcible conversion of tribal cadres/civilians to Christianity. 

Other leaders of the original NLFT included ‘Vice President’ Kamini Debbarma, ‘Publicity Secretary’ Binoy Debbarma, ‘Chief of Army’ Dhanu Koloi, and ‘Finance Secretary’ Bishnu Prasad Jamatiya. 

===Biswamohan faction===
The Biswamohan faction (NLFT/BM) is earlier headed by Biswamohan Debbarma. In May 2017 In a meeting at an undisclosed location, selected Subir Debbarma alias Yamorok (45), as the new &#x27;president&#x27; of the organization renaming it as the NLFT SD. It later signed a memorandum of Settlement with Government of India to abide by The Constitution of India &amp; join the mainstream on 10 August 2019.

Upon the surrender of Mantu Koloi, second in command, he requested that Biswamohan Debbarma and Ranjit Debbarma engage in talks with the Government of India to resolve the crisis. This was sparked by the Bangladeshi government&#x27;s crackdown on hostile groups. The government there were able to do this by extensively searching the Sacherri jungles where the organization had many of its hideouts.
However, both leaders vowed to fight on.

 This group signed peace pact with Government of India ending decade long insurgency in the presence of president Biswamohan Debbarma and vice president Upendra Reang alias Twijwlang@zerifa as the dignitaries of NLFT(BM) at 4 September 2024 in NEW DELHI.

===Nayanbasi faction===
The Nayanbasi faction has approximately 50 sophisticated weapons, 50 persons in collaboration with the group, and 150 cadres in active duty. In January 2004, the Nayanbasi faction group sent a message to the Additional Director of General Police (ADG) with the intention to start peace talks. These meetings ultimately were not successful. Later that year it peacefully entered into a Memorandum of Settlement with India.

==Location==
The group has been banned from the Indian government since the Unlawful Activities Act of 1967. Therefore, the group operates from its headquarters in Khagrachari, a district in Bangladesh around 45 km from Simanapur. The National Liberation Front of Tripura has the ability to utilize this 856 km of the border that is unfenced and susceptible to invasion.

==Attacks==
The National Liberation Front of Tripura had conducted 81 attacks on various locations in South Asia and specifically in Tripura. Of these 81 attacks, handguns and firearms have been the most common weapon.

During the period 1992–2001, total of 764 civilians and 184 security forces personnel were killed in NLFT attacks, 124 members of the organization were killed in these attacks. Later, during the period 2005–2015, NLFT has been responsible for 317 incidents in which 28 security forces and 62 civilians lost their lives.

==Objectives/Ideologies==
A common ideology within the NLFT was Tripuri Nationalism. This has two components: a Tripura state that is for only the native citizens, and the Bengalis that inhabit Tripura have no political rights or power. Among the leadership and followers of the NLFT, there are a few common objectives that come to the surface when doing analysis on this group. 

# To liberate Tripura from the union of India
# To deport all Indians and Bangladeshis who entered into Tripura after 1947.
# To restore alienated tribal lands

== Peace Accord ==
Tripura Peace Accord is the tripartite accord signed-in on 10 August 2019 by the Government of India, Government of Tripura and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) to end the insurgency.

The tripartite memorandum of understanding was signed by Satyendra Garg, Joint Secretary (Northeast) of Ministry of Home Affairs, Kumar Alok, Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Tripura and Sabir Kumar Debbarma and Kajal Debbarma of NLFT.

On 4 September 2024, the remaining faction of NLFT along with ATTF signed the 2024 Tripura Peace Accord with Government of India, Government of Tripura ending the 35 year old Insurgency in Tripura.

==Flag==
The NLFT has its own flag which consists of three colors: green, white, and red. The green portion of the flag symbolizes sovereignty over Tripura, the land to which they lay claim. The white portion of the flag signifies the peace they desire to. The color red represents the revolution and the blood that has been shed in the name of their revolution. The final part of the flag is the star which acts as the guiding light for the Borok during this struggle.

<doc id="642180" wikidata="Q503481" url="?curid=642180" title="Cay">
<text>A cay ( ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans, including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef.

==Etymology==
The Taíno word for &quot;island&quot;, &quot;cairi&quot;, became &quot;cayo&quot; in Spanish and &quot;cay&quot; in English (spelled &quot;key&quot; in American English).

==Formation and composition==
A cay forms when ocean currents transport loose sediment across the surface of a reef to where the current slows or converges with another current, releasing its sediment load. Gradually, layers of deposited sediment build up on the reef surface – a &quot;depositional node&quot;. Such nodes occur in windward or leeward areas of reefs, where flat surfaces sometimes rise around an emergent outcrop of old reef or beach rock.

The island resulting from sediment accumulation is made up almost entirely of the skeletal remains of plants and animals – &quot;biogenic sediment&quot; – from the surrounding reef ecosystems. If the accumulated sediments are predominantly sand, then the island is called a &quot;cay&quot;; if they are predominantly gravel, the island is called a &quot;motu&quot;.

Cay sediments are largely composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO), primarily of aragonite, calcite, and high-magnesium calcite. They are produced by myriad plants (e.g., coralline algae, species of the green algae &quot;Halimeda&quot;) and animals (e.g., coral, molluscs, foraminifera). Small amounts of silicate sediment are also contributed by sponges and other creatures. Over time, soil and vegetation may develop on a cay surface, assisted by the deposition of sea bird guano.

==Development and stability==
A range of physical, biological and chemical influences determines the ongoing development or erosion of cay environments. These influences include:
* the extent of reef surface sand accumulations,
* changes in ocean waves, currents, tides, sea levels, and weather conditions,
* the shape of the underlying reef,
* the types and abundance of carbonate producing biota and other organisms such as binders, bioeroders, and bioturbators (creatures that bind, erode, and mix sediments) living in surrounding reef ecosystems.

Significant changes in cays and their surrounding ecosystems can result from natural phenomena such as severe El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. Also, tropical cyclones can either help build up or tear down these islands.

There is much debate and concern over the future stability of cays in the face of growing human populations and pressures on reef ecosystems, and predicted climate changes and sea level rise. There is also debate around whether these islands are relict features that effectively stopped expanding two thousand years ago during the late Holocene or, as recent research suggests, they are still growing, with significant new accumulation of reef sediments.

Understanding the potential for change in the sediment sources and supply of cay beaches with environmental change is an important key to predicting their stability. Despite, or perhaps because of, all the debate around the future of cays there is consensus that these island environments are very complex and fairly fragile.

==Examples==
Examples of cays include: 

* A few of the Florida Keys, such as Sand Key, are &quot;cays&quot; as defined above. (Most of the Florida Keys are exposed ancient coral reefs, and the oolite beds that formed behind reefs.)
* Heron Island, Australia, a coral cay on the southern Great Barrier Reef 
* Prickly Pear Cays, Anguilla
* Rama Cay, Nicaragua
* Tobacco Caye, Dangriga, Belize
* Warraber Island in central Torres Strait (), Australia, a small &quot;vegetated sand cay&quot; according to McLean and Stoddart (1978) and Hopley (1982). Approximately , this island is situated on the leeward surface of a large emergent reef platform. This cay and the surrounding reef flat formed in the Holocene, over a prior Pleistocene platform.
* Elbow Cays, Bahamas
* Great Goat Island, Jamaica
* Ocean Cay
* The Cays of Morrocoy, Venezuela

<text>The Waipā River is in the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand. The headwaters are in the Rangitoto Range east of Te Kūiti. It flows north for , passing through Ōtorohanga and Pirongia, before flowing into the Waikato River at Ngāruawāhia. It is the Waikato&#x27;s largest tributary. The Waipā&#x27;s main tributary is the Puniu River.

In the headwaters upstream of Ōtorohanga the river can be very clear during low flow conditions. This section of the river flows through rough farmland and patches of native bush. In this clearer part of the river there can be very good fly fishing for trout but access to the river may be limited without landowner permission.

The Waipā is prone to flooding in its lower reaches as flood flows can be over 100 times——those of dry flows and the river can rise up to .

In 2013 Maniapoto Māori Trust Board and the riparian local councils set up a joint management agreement for the river, following the passing of Nga Wai o Maniapoto ( Waipā River) Act 2012. On 16 July 2020 the official name was gazetted as Waipā River.

The table below shows the time water takes to flow the from Te Kūiti to its confluence with the Waikato in times of low flow (15% of days are slower than this) and high flow (15% of days faster).

== Floods ==
Years with large floods have included 1875, 1892, 1893, 1897, 1907, 1926, 1930, 1946, 1953, 1958, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1995, 1998, 2002, 2004 and 2012.

In August 1893 the river was 3 inches (7.6 cm) higher than it was in during the 1875 flood. Maunder&#x27;s mill at Whatawhata and bridges on the Whatawhata to Tuhikaramea road were washed away.

A minimum flow of /second was measured in 1946 and a flood flow of over /sec was measured in the May 1953 floods. In 1958 hundreds of houses were flooded in Ōtorohanga and Tu Kuiti. The July 1998 peak flows in the upper Waipā 776 were the highest recorded since 1958 and at Whatawhata flows were /sec, compared to /sec in 1958.

In July 2002 flows at Whatawhata were /sec and, in March 2004, /sec. The 2004 flood was comparable to that of 1958. At Ōtorohanga, the Primary School and surrounding houses were flooded, when the river spilled into its old course (see map below) and filled the area behind the stop banks. There was also flooding in July 2012.

== Power stations ==
In 2003 Hydro Power Ltd was given consent to build a hydro-electric power station, with weirs in the Okahukura Stream, upstream from Owen Falls, and penstocks carrying water down the gorge to a station on the west bank below the falls. Work was done in 2006, but, in 2007, Hydro Energy ( Waipā) Ltd was fined for unconsented damage to native vegetation in building the penstock. The resource was initially estimated to be able to generate 10 to 20MW. Construction halted, though Renewable Power Ltd bought the asset in 2010 and estimates potential at 9MW.

In 2017 Nova Energy gained consent to build a 360MW gas-turbine station (connected to the Maui Gas Pipeline) on the Ongaruhe Stream, close to its confluence with the Waipā. The mid-merit Waikato Power Plant at 869 Kawhia Rd, Ōtorohanga was expected to be used for 10 to 15 minutes, 3 or 4 times a day, but was shelved in 2021.

==Pollution==
Waikato Regional Council measures water quality monthly at five sites from Mangaokewa to Whatawhata. The measurements show poor quality along most of the river, with excess nitrogen, silt and phosphorus, though E. coli levels have improved with improved sewage treatment, though generally not enough for safe swimming; recreational rivers should have median E. coli levels below 126 per 100ml, but Waipā&#x27;s range from 160 to 320. Turbidity levels north of Ōtorohanga rise to more than double the levels needed to support plant photosynthesis and phosphorus levels also rise above targets in that stretch. Nitrogen levels increased at all five sites between 1993 and 2012 due to intensified land use, now adding 3,075 tonnes a year. By comparison, the total from sewage works and Te Awamutu dairy factory is 66 tonnes.

Ministry for the Environment figures averaged between 1998 and 2007 showed the Waipā at Ōtorohanga had 280 E.coli per 100ml (53rd worst out of 154), 360 faecal coliforms per 100ml (83rd of 252), 0.55 mg/litre nitrogen (161th of 342) and 0.03 mg/litre phosphorus (187th of 361).

At Pirongia the figures were 390 E.coli per 100ml (35th worst out of 154), 425 faecal coliforms per 100ml (64th of 252), 0.49 mg/litre nitrogen (174th of 342) and 0.06 mg/litre phosphorus (80th of 361).
At Whatawhata the figures were 0.92 mg/litre nitrogen (94th of 342) and 0.06 mg/litre phosphorus (69th of 361).
In the Mangaokewa stream 0.02 mg/litre phosphorus (237th of 361).

Pollution has been worsening for nitrogen and phosphorus, though turbidity has improved, as shown in this table of important (ie slope direction probability over 95% and RSKSE over ±1% pa) improvements, or deteriorations (-) in relative seasonal Kendall slope estimator (RSKSE) trends (% per year). in the river at Whatawhata (monthly records are flow-adjusted using a Lowess curve fit with 30% span.) -
== Soil conservation ==
Regional Council estimates that is at risk of severe erosion in the Middle Waipā (Waitomo, Turitea, Pirongia, Karakariki, Puniu, Mangaotama, Mangawhero and Mangapiko catchments) and of stream bank to be prone to erosion. Project Watershed plans for planting on , plus 976 km of stream bank and 1,332 km of fencing, from 2017 to 2026.

=== Organic farming ===
In 2018 a scheme was launched by the Waikato River Authority to attract investment in $100 million of hybrid bonds to convert up to 18 dairy farms on , or roughly 5% of the catchment, to organic farms, with the aim of reducing pollution from the worst farms by about 45%.

== Bridges ==
Listed in order from the confluence with the Waikato and moving south they are:-
*1898 Ngāruawāhia bridge opened. Collapsed under a herd of cattle 20 December 1916 (see 1917 photo) and rebuilt in 1922 with three trusses. The bridges were preceded by a punt (see 1922 photo), supplied by the government in 1887. A new bridge was opened on 18 January 1974.
*1914–1958 Waipā Railway and Coal Co. long bridge.
*1881 (20 April) Whatawhata bridge, originally wooden and long and above high water mark, consisted of two spans of , 7 of 40 and 4 of , and cost £3700. Repairs were done in 1909, but it was in poor repair again by 1917. For £11,250 a new wooden truss bridge was built over the top of it in 1924 and finished in 1925. The current SH23 concrete bridge, which is south of the original site, was shown on the 1974 edition of the 1 inch Lands &amp; Survey map, but not on the 1965 3rd edition. Records of the road structure show it dates from 1971, which is probably the date of the bridge. The bridge replaced a punt, which had operated from 1867.
*1881 (12 August – see photo) long Te Rore bridge. Replaced 1957. In 1905, 1907 and 1958, the bridge was flooded to the handrails.
*1865 (about) Alexandra Bridge, Baffin St, Pirongia, originally built by the army. Pukehoua Bridge was built upstream in 1912–13 to replace the 1865 bridge, which was damaged by floods and by 1909 was only fit for pedestrians and light traffic. Public Works Department estimated its cost at £4,500, £1,500 coming from Government and £3,000 from Waipā (50%), Raglan (30%) and Waitomo (20%) councils.
*1882 Alexandra Bridge, McClure St, Whatiwhatihoe, Pirongia.&quot;Mr. Wright has superintended the construction of the Alexandra Bridge, over the Waipā River, to give access to Tāwhiao&#x27;s new settlement, Whatiwhatihoe (see map), and which will at the same time eventually be on the main line leading into the King country. The bridge will be open now in a fortnights&#x27; time, it consists of six spans, and three trusses, a total length of , the height being above ordinary river level. The approaches and about a mile of road, and a large culvert have been made by Mr. Wright, with Maori labor. The whole will have been completed at a cost of about £1,800.&quot; There was a plan to replace it in 1939. SH39 now crosses on a 1953 bridge.
*1915 Te Kawa Rd bridge long, high.
*Kawhia Rd, Ōtorohanga, SH31/SH39 cross on a 1964 bridge. 
*Maniapoto St, Ōtorohanga photo about 1910 SH3 now crosses on a 1964 bridge. It replaced a bridge built in the early 1950s.
*1887 North Island Main Trunk railway bridge.
*1928 Toa Bridge, Otewa Rd.

== Steamer services ==
Over was navigable by waka and Pirongia (Alexandra) was busy as the head of steamboat navigation until the railway was built to Te Awamutu in 1880, though some settlers used it as far as Te Kūiti, though possibly only as far as the confluence of the Mangapu and Mangaokewa streams, about upstream from Ōtorohanga. In 1885 the river was used to carry material for the railway construction as far as Te Kūiti. Mr Gibbons&#x27; steamship, Lillie, started in 1876 to 1878. In 1895 Walsh Bros were running &quot;SS Victory&quot;. From 1902 to 1909 H H Gould ran the 1899 5 hp &quot;SS Opuatia&quot; from Ngāruawāhia to Whatawhata one day and on to Pirongia next day. A 1915 guidebook still said, &quot;Small steamers ply up and down the river from Huntly&quot;. An 1881 article said a journey upriver would normally take 36 hours, but more in dry weather, when shoals at Whatawhata and Te Rore were hard to cross. An 1898 petition complained about wharfage charges at Mercer being a tax on residents along the Waipā. Around 1900 the Freetrader, owned by the Waikato Company, &quot;was withdrawn owing to competition from the Walsh brothers with their launch Victory, which could traverse the winding Waipā much more easily than the cumbersome stern-wheeler.&quot;

As late as 1919 Waipā County Council pressed for removal of shingle shoals to permit navigation to Pirongia and got money for improvements from government and the county councils. Evidence given to the Inland Waterways Commission in 1921 said boats carrying 20 tons could reach Pirongia for most of the year and, up to about 30 years before, vessels carried 60 tons to Pirongia and a special fleet of steamers ran to Te Kūiti. Steamers were set back by the sinking of the Opuatia at Whatawhata in 1920. The Waikato Shipping Co had been running a weekly service to Pirongia with the former Waihou River steamer, SS Erin (and sometimes SS Excelsior), which seems to have continued until WSC stopped trading in 1922. A Public Works Department report in 1925 said the river was non-navigable above its junction with the Mangapu at Ōtorohanga.

== Settlements==
Settlements near the river include Rangitoto, Ōtewā, Ōtorohanga, Pokuru, Puketōtara, Pirongia, Te Pahu, Te Rore, Ngāhinapōuri, Whatawhata, Te Kowhai, Ngāruawāhia.

<doc id="642196" wikidata="Q352462" url="?curid=642196" title="Francis II, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Francis II (Breton: &quot;Frañsez II&quot;, French: &quot;François II&quot;) (23 June 1433 – 9 September 1488) was Duke of Brittany from 1458 to his death. He was the grandson of John IV, Duke of Brittany. A recurring theme in Francis&#x27; life would be his quest to maintain the quasi-independence of Brittany from France. As such, his reign was characterized by conflicts with King Louis XI of France and with his daughter, Anne of France, who served as regent during the minority of her brother, King Charles VIII. The armed and unarmed conflicts from 1465 to 1477 and 1484–1488 have been called the &quot;War of the Public Weal&quot; and the Mad War (&quot;la Guerre Folle&quot;), respectively.

==Early life==

Francis was born on 23 June 1433 to Richard of Brittany, Count of Étampes (1395–1438) and his wife, Margaret of Orléans, Countess of Vertus (1406–1466). Richard of Brittany was the youngest son of Duke John IV of Brittany. Richard&#x27;s older brothers, John V and Arthur III, both succeeded their father as duke, but upon Arthur&#x27;s death in 1458 (John V&#x27;s sons Francis I and Peter II died in 1450 and 1457 respectively, without sons), the only legitimate male heir was his nephew Francis.

==Relationship with English royalty==

===Protector of the House of Lancaster===
Francis unexpectedly became the protector of England&#x27;s House of Lancaster in exile from 1471 to 1484. During the latter half of the 15th century, civil war existed in England as the House of York and House of Lancaster fought each other for the English throne. In 1471, the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury. The Lancastrian king, Henry VI of England and his only son, Edward of Westminster, died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. Subsequently, the Yorkist king, Edward IV of England, was in complete control of England. He attainted those who refused to submit to his rule, such as Jasper Tudor and his nephew Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII of England), naming them as traitors and confiscating their lands.

Francis gained custody over the Tudors when they tried to flee to France but strong winds in the English Channel forced them to land at Le Conquet in Brittany. Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne, and King Edward IV regarded him as &quot;a nobody&quot;. However, Francis viewed Henry as a valuable bargaining tool for England&#x27;s aid, when in conflicts with France, and therefore kept the Tudors under his protection. He housed Jasper Tudor, Henry Tudor, and the core of their group of exiled Lancastrians at the Château de Suscinio in Sarzeau, where they remained for 11 years. There, Francis generously supported this group of exiled Englishmen against all the Plantagenet demands that he should surrender them.

In October 1483, Henry Tudor launched a failed invasion of England from Brittany. Francis supported this invasion by providing 40,000 gold crowns, 15,000 soldiers, and a fleet of transport ships. Henry&#x27;s fleet of 15 chartered vessels was scattered by a storm, and his ship reached the coast of England in company with only one other vessel. Henry realised that the soldiers on shore were the men of the new Yorkist king, Richard III of England, and so he decided to abandon the invasion and return to Brittany. As for Henry&#x27;s main conspirator in England, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, he was convicted of treason and beheaded on 2 November 1483, way before Henry&#x27;s ships landed in England. For Henry&#x27;s conspiracy against King Richard III had been unravelled, and without the Duke of Buckingham or Henry Tudor, the rebellion was easily crushed.

Survivors of the failed uprising then fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry Tudor&#x27;s claim to the throne. On Christmas Day in 1483 at the Rennes Cathedral, Henry swore an oath to marry King Edward IV&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth of York, and thus unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster. Henry&#x27;s rising prominence made him a great threat to King Richard III, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to Duke Francis II to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from the King. In mid-1484, Francis was incapacitated by one of his periods of illness, and while recuperating, his treasurer, Pierre Landais, took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with King Richard III to send Henry and his uncle Jasper back to England in exchange for a pledge of 3,000 English archers to defend Brittany against a threatened French attack. John Morton, a bishop of Flanders, learnt of the scheme and warned the Tudors in time. The Tudors then managed to escape separately, hours ahead of Landais&#x27; soldiers, across the nearby border into France. They were received at the court of King Charles VIII of France, who allowed them to stay and provided them with resources. Shortly afterwards, when Francis had recovered, he offered the 400 remaining Lancastrians, still at and around the Château de Suscinio, safe-conduct into France and even paid for their expenses. For the French, the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that King Richard III did not interfere with French plans to acquire Brittany. Thus, the loss of the Lancastrians seriously played against the interests of Francis II.

==Relationship with French royalty==
===King Louis XI===
Louis XI was renowned as a cunning adversary and a master at diplomacy, if not the military arts. His contemporary nickname was &quot;The Universal Spider,&quot; reflecting his constant political plotting.

Francis became a member of the League of the Public Weal. This was an alliance of feudal nobles organized in 1465 in defiance of the centralized authority of King Louis XI of France, whose declared aim was to enlarge the French royal domain by annexing all of the duchies – Burgundy, Berry, Normandy, Orléans, Brittany, etc. It was masterminded by Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais, son of the Duke of Burgundy, with the king&#x27;s brother Charles, Duke of Berry, as a figurehead.

In 1467 Charles the Bold inherited the Duchy of Burgundy, which held fiefs in France that included the counties of Artois and Flanders, and the Imperial lands of Holland, Brabant, and Luxembourg. As Duke of Burgundy, Charles aspired to forge a kingdom of his own between France and Germany, approximating the former domains of the Frankish Emperor Lothair I. But Charles was killed in 1477 at the Battle of Nancy against René II, Duke of Lorraine and a hired army of Swiss mercenaries, and Louis was saved from his greatest adversary. The great Duchy of Burgundy was then absorbed into the Kingdom of France, and the League of the Public Weal was essentially defeated, although several members would re-ally for the Mad War in 1485.

The fortunes of Francis and Brittany would continue to deteriorate after Louis XI&#x27;s death in 1483, as his daughter Anne of France would serve as regent for putative successor Charles VIII.

===Regency of Anne of France===
Francis was anxious to maintain his duchy&#x27;s autonomy during the minority of Charles VIII of France. He aligned himself with Louis, the Duke of Orléans (the future Louis XII) and Charles, Count of Angoulême, against the regency of Anne of France. She had been pursuing the same underhand politics towards Brittany as her father Louis XI.

In focusing on relations with his neighbour France, however, Francis II neglected his own realm. His corrupt and oppressive prime minister, Guillaume Chauvin, who was overthrown by treasurer general Pierre Landais in 1477, died in prison on 5 April 1484. A large part of the nobility had been bribed by Anne and Charles and supported them in their eagerness to subjugate Brittany. These nobles performed a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; ousting Landais, who was eventually hanged in 1485.

In 1486, the Estates of Brittany confirmed Francis&#x27; daughter Anne and heir and successor to further assure the Duchy&#x27;s autonomy from France. The Treaty of Chateaubriant was signed with France in 1487 and reaffirmed Brittany&#x27;s autonomy. Despite the Treaty of Chateaubriant, however, the French continued to harass the Duchy. Under the leadership of Louis II de la Trémoille, the French royal army struck against Vannes and Fougères, controlling access to Brittany.

====&quot;La Guerre Folle&quot; (The Mad War)====

Francis then allied with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, against France. Alain d&#x27;Albret, a rebel lord, believing he would marry Francis&#x27; daughter Anne, reinforced the Breton army with 5000 troops supplied by the king of Spain. Maximilian I of Austria also sent 1500 men, and Edward Woodville, Lord Scales, brought over a force of archers from Britain. Francis, however, was defeated on 28 July 1488 in the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier. This battle also destroyed the power-base of the warring noble leaders as Edward Woodville was killed, and Louis of Orléans and John IV of Chalon-Arlay were captured. Alain d&#x27;Albret and the Maréchal de Rieux succeeded in escaping, and played an important part in continuing the conflict.

A few days later, on 10 August, Francis was forced to sign the Treaty of Verger. Under the terms of the treaty, the duke was compelled to submit himself and his duchy as a vassal of the king of France, and to expel foreign princes and troops from Brittany. It also restricted his ability to marry his children to suitors of his choosing and required that he cede territory in Saint-Malo, Fougères, Dinan, and Saint-Aubin to the king as a guarantee that in the absence of a male successor the king would determine the succession. Francis died a month later as a result of a fall from his horse during a leisurely ride. He left only a daughter, Anne of Brittany, so the treaty was used to force her, as his successor, to marry Charles VIII, and later Louis XII. Despite the French victory and the signing of the treaty, la Guerre Folle dragged on beyond Francis&#x27; death for three more years until December 1491, when Anne married Charles VIII.

Francis is interred in an elaborate tomb in the Nantes Cathedral. His tomb was commissioned by his daughter Anne, and is an important early example of Renaissance sculpture in France.

==Family==

Francis was married twice. His first wife was Margaret of Brittany, the eldest daughter of Francis I, Duke of Brittany (his first cousin) and Isabella of Scotland. They had one son who died shortly after his birth:
* John, Count of Montfort (29 June – 25 August 1463)

Francis&#x27; second wife was Margaret of Foix, Princess of Navarre, daughter of Gaston IV, Count of Foix and Queen Eleanor of Navarre. They had:
* Anne of Brittany (1477–1514), his only legitimate heir to reach adulthood.
* Isabeau of Brittany (1478–1490), betrothed to Jean d&#x27;Albret in 1481, died young, and was buried in the cathedral of Rennes.

Francis also had five illegitimate children with Antoinette de Maignelais, the former mistress of King Charles VII of France.

==Legacy==
Breton nobles acted to safeguard Anne as their Duchess and to protect the Duchy&#x27;s autonomy for which Francis had fought so hard. In 1489 these nobles signed the Treaty of Redon with Henry VII; that treaty between Brittany and England was intended to prevent the annexation of Brittany by France. However, in 1491 Charles VIII of France invaded Brittany and forced Anne to marry him, thereby gaining control of the duchy. Then in 1492 Henry VII signed the Treaty of Étaples with France, effectively removing England&#x27;s defense of Breton autonomy in return for promises from the French to no longer support Perkin Warbeck, pretender to the English throne, and to pay a war indemnity. The duchy&#x27;s autonomy was all but lost as the process of merging it into the French crown began, and Brittany&#x27;s strongest ally was neutralized. Anne, however, became a formidable queen consort and fought to preserve Brittany&#x27;s autonomy and Francis II&#x27;s legacy for herself, the Breton people, and her descendants.

<doc id="642213" wikidata="Q939053" url="?curid=642213" title="Chuck Knoblauch">
<text>Edward Charles Knoblauch (; born July 7, 1968) is an American former professional baseball player. He played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1991 through 2002, for the Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees, and Kansas City Royals. He played mostly as a second baseman before moving to left field for his final two seasons.

==Early life==
Born in Houston, Texas, Knoblauch came from a baseball family, as his uncle Eddie Knoblauch and father Ray Knoblauch played and managed in the minor leagues between the late 1930s and mid-1950s. Knoblauch played for the Bellaire High School baseball team, which also produced many other former major leaguers, including Chris Young and Jose Cruz, Jr. Knoblauch missed his senior season (1986) due to a broken leg, but he cheered from the bench as the team won the state championship.

The Philadelphia Phillies selected Knoblauch in the 18th round of the 1986 amateur draft, but he did not sign. He attended Texas A&amp;M University and played college baseball for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, where he was a second-team All-American. He later played on the 1989 team that finished the season with 58 wins, the highest total in school history.

In 1988, Knoblauch played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), and received the league&#x27;s Outstanding Pro Prospect award. In 2001, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.

==Major league career==

===Minnesota Twins===

Knoblauch was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the 1989 MLB draft. Knoblauch won the American League Rookie of the Year award and a World Series ring as a member of the 1991 Minnesota Twins. In Game 7 of the World Series, Knoblauch attempted to deceive Lonnie Smith by appearing to start a double play on a Terry Pendleton double (causing Smith to get only to third base when he might have scored for the Atlanta Braves). Smith claimed he lost track of the ball and Knoblauch&#x27;s decoy was not a factor.

During the 1994–96 seasons, Knoblauch batted .312, .333, and .341, respectively, won the AL Gold Glove Award at second base in 1997, and stole over 40 bases in three consecutive seasons.

The Twins traded Knoblauch to the New York Yankees for Eric Milton, Cristian Guzmán, Brian Buchanan, Danny Mota, and $3 million on February 6, 1998. Once a popular player in Minnesota, his request to be traded from the Twins resulted in being booed on successive trips to the Metrodome. This included throwing hot dogs, bottles, and golf balls at Knoblauch during a visit to the Metrodome in 2001.

===New York Yankees===
Knoblauch&#x27;s arrival in New York was greeted with anticipation. Buster Olney, then with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, predicted that Knoblauch and Derek Jeter would form the greatest double play combination in history. Though he struggled early on with the team, he hit a career-high 17 home runs as the Yankees won a then-American league-record 114 games. In game 2 of the 1998 American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians, Knoblauch was involved in an infamous defensive play. In the 12th inning with the score tied 1–1, Indians batter Travis Fryman bunted, and Knoblauch covered first base for a possible putout. Jeff Nelson&#x27;s throw hit Fryman and rolled away, but instead of retrieving the ball, Knoblauch argued with the first-base umpire interference should have been called, while the ball was still live at which Indians baserunner Enrique Wilson was able to score from first base on the play, giving Cleveland the lead in an eventual 4–1 victory. A New York newspaper called Knoblauch a &quot;Blauch-head&quot;. Knoblauch recovered and was an important factor in the World Series victory over the San Diego Padres, and the 1999 World Series victory over the Atlanta Braves. In Game 3 of the 1999 World Series, Knoblauch scored the game&#x27;s first run and hit a dramatic two-run home run in the eighth inning to tie the score, with the Yankees eventually winning in the 10th inning. In Game 5 of 2001 World Series, Knoblauch scored the winning run, having led off the inning with a single and scoring on a single by his replacement at second base, Alfonso Soriano. The Yankees won the American League pennant every year he was with the team, winning three World Series championships.

===Kansas City Royals===
Towards the end of his career, Knoblauch&#x27;s performance at the plate grew worse, with many observers believing he was preoccupied by his fielding troubles and trying too hard to hit home runs. Knoblauch was benched in the final game of the 2001 World Series (he hit just .056), and left for Kansas City as a free agent in the off season. Knoblauch played in just 80 games in left field for the Royals, batting .210, and the team declined to offer him a new contract the following year. In 2003, having failed to gain a job with an MLB team, Knoblauch announced his retirement.

==Throwing troubles==
Once considered one of the game&#x27;s best fielders (in fact, ESPN personalities nicknamed him &quot;Fundamentally Sound&quot; Chuck Knoblauch), Knoblauch&#x27;s play deteriorated shortly into his Yankee career; his errors at second doubled from 13 in 1998 to 26 the following year; all of these were throwing errors. In 2000, he began to have difficulty making accurate throws to first base, a condition sometimes referred to in baseball as the &quot;yips&quot; or &quot;Steve Sax syndrome&quot; in more recent years.

Knoblauch tried various solutions to his problem, but his throwing did not improve. He made 15 errors in less than half a season in 2000, including 10 throwing miscues. (During one game, an errant throw sailed into the stands and hit sportscaster Keith Olbermann&#x27;s mother in the head). After making three throwing errors in six innings of the Yankees&#x27; 12–3 loss to the Chicago White Sox, on June 15, 2000, Knoblauch voluntarily left the game. He then left Yankee Stadium in his street clothes while the game was still in progress. He was back at second the next day, but Knoblauch never fully recovered his throwing accuracy, especially after missing most of August with an injury. Knoblauch returned to the Yankees in September, but was often used as a designated hitter in lieu of playing second; he was exclusively a DH in the Yankees&#x27; run to a World Series title. Finally, in 2001, he was reassigned to left field by manager Joe Torre, never to return to his old position.

==Spousal assaults==
On September 25, 2009, an officer from the Memorial Villages Police Department, near Houston, was told by Knoblauch&#x27;s wife that he hit and choked her. A police officer&#x27;s affidavit alleged that &quot;redness around her neck and swelling near her eye [were] consistent with her statement.&quot; On September 29, 2009, the Harris County, Texas District Attorney charged Knoblauch with assaulting a family member by choking, a third-degree felony in Texas. Knoblauch pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in connection with the case on March 16, 2010. The couple was reportedly going through a divorce.

On July 24, 2014, the 46-year-old Knoblauch was charged with assault of a family member again. Due to this incident, the Twins cancelled the planned induction of Knoblauch into the Twins Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==
A four-time All-Star, in his career Knoblauch batted .289 with 98 home runs and 615 runs batted in. He stole 25 or more bases in 10 of his 12 seasons, finishing with 407 in his career — including 276 with the Twins, the most for the team since its move from Washington in 1961. On August 18, 2018, Knoblauch returned to the new Yankee Stadium to commemorate the 1998 championship team.

==HGH use==
In December 2007, Knoblauch was included in the Mitchell report, which provided evidence that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his career. In the Mitchell report, Brian McNamee stated that he procured human growth hormone (HGH) from Kirk Radomski for Knoblauch in 2001 when he served as the New York Yankees assistant strength coach. McNamee stated that during the season, he injected Knoblauch seven to nine times with HGH. McNamee states that Knoblauch paid Radomski for the drugs through him or Jason Grimsley, and also believed that Knoblauch obtained HGH from Grimsley. Knoblauch did not respond to a request to meet with the Mitchell investigators to discuss the allegations.

On December 20, 2007, Knoblauch was named in Jason Grimsley&#x27;s unsealed affidavit as an alleged user of HGH. Knoblauch and Grimsley were teammates on the Yankees from 1999 to 2000.

On January 11, 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a look at Chuck Knoblauch&#x27;s post-baseball life. The article painted Knoblauch&#x27;s outlook on baseball and the Mitchell report as being apathetic. As he has been retired for 5 years, he expressed &quot;bewilderment at his inclusion&quot; in the report and stated, &quot;I have nothing to defend and I have nothing to hide at the same time.&quot; In 2008, Knoblauch owned a condominium and house in the Houston area, and was not interested in returning to pro baseball in any capacity.

On January 22, 2008, Knoblauch was subpoenaed by the congressional committee investigating steroids in baseball after he failed to respond to an invitation to give a deposition by a January 18, 2008, deadline. On January 23, federal marshals had as yet been unable to find Knoblauch to serve him with the subpoena.

On January 28, 2008, the congressional subpoena was withdrawn after Knoblauch agreed to provide a deposition on February 1, 2008.

Knoblauch admitted to using HGH: &quot;I did HGH. It didn&#x27;t help me out. It didn&#x27;t make me any better. I had the worst years of my career from a batting average standpoint. And I got hurt. So there was no good that came out of it for me — it was not performance-enhancing for me.&quot;

<doc id="642214" wikidata="Q201143" url="?curid=642214" title="Anne of Brittany">
<text>Anne of Brittany (; 25/26 January 1477 – 9 January 1514) was reigning Duchess of Brittany from 1488 until her death, and Queen of France from 1491 to 1498 and from 1499 to her death. She was the only woman to have been queen consort of France twice. During the Italian Wars, Anne also became Queen of Naples, from 1501 to 1504, and Duchess of Milan, in 1499–1500 and from 1500 to 1512.

Anne was raised in Nantes during a series of conflicts in which the King of France sought to assert his suzerainty over Brittany. Her father, Francis II, Duke of Brittany, was the last male heir of the House of Montfort. Upon his death in 1488, Anne became duchess regnant of Brittany, countess of Nantes, Montfort, and Richmond, and viscountess of Limoges. She was only 11 at that time, but she was already considered a desirable prospect for marriage because of Brittany&#x27;s strategic position. The next year, she married Maximilian I of Austria by proxy, but Charles VIII of France saw this as a threat since his realm was located between Brittany and Austria. He started a military campaign which eventually forced the duchess to renounce her marriage.

Anne eventually married Charles VIII in 1491. None of their children survived early childhood, and when the king died in 1498, the throne went to his cousin, Louis XII. Following an agreement made to secure the annexation of Brittany, Anne had to marry the new king. Louis XII was deeply in love with his wife and Anne had many opportunities to reassert the independence of her duchy. They had two daughters, although neither could succeed to the French throne due to the Salic law, the elder was proclaimed the heiress of Brittany. Anne managed to have her elder daughter engaged to Charles of Austria, grandchild of Maximilian I, but after Anne&#x27;s death in 1514, her daughter married her cousin Francis I of France. This marriage later led to the formal union between France and Brittany.

Anne was highly regarded in Brittany as a conscientious ruler who defended the duchy against France. In the Romantic period, she became a figure of Breton patriotism and she was honoured with many memorials and statues. Her artistic legacy is important in the Loire Valley, where she spent most of her life. She was notably responsible, with her husbands, for architectural projects in the &quot;châteaux&quot; of Blois and Amboise.

==Life==

===Early years and education===
Anne was born on 25 or 26 January 1477 in the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in the city of Nantes in what is now the Loire-Atlantique &quot;département&quot; of France, as the eldest child of Duke Francis II of Brittany and his second wife Margaret of Foix, Infanta of Navarre. Four years later (before 10 May 1481), her parents had a second daughter, Isabelle. Her mother died when Anne was nine, while her father died when Anne was eleven years old.

It is likely that she learned to read and write in French, and perhaps a little Latin. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, it was unlikely that she learned Greek or Hebrew and never spoke or understood the Breton language. She was raised by a governess, Françoise de Dinan, Lady of Chateaubriant and by marriage Countess of Laval. In addition, she had several tutors, including her butler and court poet, Jean Meschinot, who is thought to have taught her dancing, singing and music.

===Heiress of Brittany===
In this period, the law of succession was unclear, but prior to the Breton War of Succession mainly operated according to semi-Salic Law; i.e., noble women could inherit, but only if the male line had died out. The Treaty of Guérande in 1365, however, stated that in the absence of a male heir from the House of Montfort, the heirs of Joanna of Penthièvre would succeed. By the time Anne was born, her father was the only male from the Breton House of Montfort-Brittany, and the Blois-Penthièvre heir was a female, Nicole of Blois, who in 1480 sold her rights over Brittany to King Louis XI of France for the amount of 50,000 écus.

The lack of a male heir gave rise to the threat of a dynastic crisis in the Duchy, or to its passing directly into the royal domain. To avoid this, Francis II had Anne officially recognised as his heiress by the Estates of Brittany on 10 February 1486; however, the question of her marriage remained a diplomatic issue.

===Betrothals===
Being the first eldest surviving child and heiress of the Duchy of Brittany, Anne was, above all, the instrument of paternal politics. Francis II indeed promised his daughter to various French or foreign princes in order to obtain military and financial aid, and to strengthen his position against the King of France. The prospect for these princes to add the duchy to their domain thus allowed the Duke of Brittany to initiate several marriage negotiations and to forge various secret alliances which accompanied these matrimonial projects. Anne became the stake of these rival ambitions, and her father, reassured by the signing of these alliances, could afford to refuse various marriage projects and contracts. These political calculations thus led to Anne&#x27;s engagement with different European princes:

*In 1480 she was officially promised in marriage to Edward, Prince of Wales, son of Edward IV of England; however, soon after the death of Edward IV in 1483, the boy disappeared, presumed to have been killed – possibly on the orders of his regent, Richard III.
*Henry Tudor, the future King Henry VII of England, last male representative of the Lancaster branch, then in exile in Brittany showed interest in being a suitor for Anne&#x27;s hand, but this marriage did not interest her father.
*Maximilian, King of the Romans and Archduke of Austria, widower of Mary of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Charles the Bold.
*Alain I of Albret, son of Catherine of Rohan and Jean I of Albret. Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of Duke John V of Brittany, and thus a possible heir. Although he was an ally of Duke Francis II, Anne refused to marry him because she found him repulsive. Before the papal court, convened by Marshal Rieux, a proponent of Albret&#x27;s suit, to give the couple a dispensation to marry, Anne declared that she had only entertained his offer of marriage due to &quot;l&#x27;obéissance, crainte &amp; révérence&quot; [the obedience, fear, and reverence] due to her father, and that she herself did not want it.
*Louis, Duke of Orléans, cousin of King Charles VIII and in turn future King, was another aspirant for her hand, despite being already married to the King&#x27;s sister Joan.
*John IV of Chalon-Arlay, Prince of Orange. A grandson of Richard, Count of Étampes, and nephew of Francis II, he was in line to the throne after Anne and Isabelle.
*Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham. In 1488 Henry VII had suggested a marriage between Buckingham and Anne, but in December 1489 the executors of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, paid the King £4000 for Buckingham&#x27;s marriage to Percy&#x27;s eldest daughter Eleanor.
*Viscount John II of Rohan, also in line to the Breton Ducal throne, offered with the support of Marshal Jean IV de Rieux a double marriage of his sons François and Jean with Anne and her sister Isabelle, but Francis II opposed this plan.

===Marriages===
In 1488, Francis II was defeated at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier, ending the Mad War (&quot;la Guerre Folle&quot;) between Brittany and France. In the Treaty of Sablé (19 August 1488), which concluded the peace settlement, the Duke was forced to accept clauses stipulating that his daughters were not to marry without the approval of the King of France.

With the death of Francis II soon afterwards (9 September 1488) as a result of a fall from his horse, Brittany was plunged into a fresh crisis, leading to the final Franco-Breton war. On his deathbed, the Duke made his daughter promise never to consent to the subjugation of the Duchy to the Kingdom of France. Before he died, Francis II appointed the Marshal of Rieux guardian of his daughter.

After fleeing Nantes following the division of her advisors over the issue of her marriage, Anne was crowned Duchess of Brittany in Rennes on 10 February 1489. At the age of thirteen, on 19 December 1490, she was married by proxy to Maximilian I of Austria at Rennes Cathedral. This conferred upon her the title Queen of the Romans. The French regarded it as a serious provocationit not only violated the Treaty of Sablé (the King of France not having consented to the marriage), but also reintroduced an enemy of the French as ruler of Brittany, which they had wanted to avoid during the 14th and 15th centuries. The marriage also proved ill-timed: the Habsburgs were too busy in Hungary to pay any serious attention to Brittany, and the Castilians were busy fighting in Granada.

Although both Castile and England sent small numbers of troops to supplement the Ducal army, neither wished for open warfare with France. The spring of 1491 brought new successes by the French general La Trémoille (the previous victor of the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier), and King Charles VIII of France came to lay siege to Rennes, where Anne stayed, to force her to desist from her Habsburg marriage. Aided by troops from England, the Holy Roman Empire, and Aragon and Castile, Rennes lasted through two months of Charles&#x27;s siege before falling. During this time, Anne&#x27;s sister Isabelle died.

Charles VIII entered the city on 15 November, and both parties signed the Treaty of Rennes, ending the fourth military campaign of the French over Brittany. After refusing all proposed marriages with French princes, Anne became engaged to the King on 17 November 1491, in the vault of the Jacobins in Rennes. Then, escorted by her army (ostensibly to show that she had willingly consented to the marriage), Anne went to Langeais to be married. Austria made diplomatic protests (especially before the Holy See), claiming that the marriage was illegal because the bride was unwilling, that she was already legally married to Maximilian, and that Charles VIII was legally betrothed to Margaret of Austria, Maximilian&#x27;s daughter.

The official marriage between Anne and King Charles VIII of France was celebrated in the Great Hall of the Château de Langeais on 6 December 1491 at dawn. The ceremony was concluded discreetly and urgently because it was technically illegal until Pope Innocent VIII, in exchange for substantial concessions, validated the union on 15 February 1492, by granting the annulment of the marriage by proxy with Maximilian, and also giving a dispensation for the marriage with Charles VIII, needed because the King and Anne were related in the forbidden fourth degree of consanguinity. The marriage contract provided that the spouse who outlived the other would retain possession of Brittany; however, it also stipulated that if Charles VIII died without male heirs, Anne would marry his successor, thus ensuring the French kings a second chance to annex Brittany permanently.

===Queen of France===
By the marriage of 1491, Anne of Brittany became Queen consort of France. Her marriage contract stated that it was concluded to &quot;ensure peace between the Duchy of Brittany and the Kingdom of France&quot;. She made Charles VIII her perpetual representative. On 8 February 1492, Anne was crowned Queen of France at St. Denis Basilica. She was the first Queen crowned there and consecrated, &quot;anointed in the head and chest&quot; by André d&#x27;Espinay, Archbishop of Bordeaux. Her husband forbade her to use the title of Duchess of Brittany, which became a bone of contention between the two. Gabriel Miron became the Chancellor of the Queen and her first doctor; he signed the marriage contract of the Queen with King Louis XII on 1 January 1499.

Anne&#x27;s marriage began badly: she brought two beds with her when she came to marry Charles, and the King and Queen often lived apart; despite this, she was pregnant for most of her married life (with a child every fourteen months on average). When her husband fought in the wars in Italy, the regency powers were exercised by his sister Anne of Beaujeu, who had held this position between 1483 and 1491. Anne of Brittany had a limited role in France and Brittany and sometimes had to accept being separated from her children in infancy. She lived primarily in the royal castles of Amboise, Loches and Plessis or in the towns of Lyon, Grenoble or Moulins (when the king was in Italy). At Amboise, when Charles VIII had work, she mainly resided in the nearby Clos Lucé, the future home of Leonardo da Vinci. She built her chapel.

She became Queen Consort of Naples and Jerusalem during the conquest of Naples by Charles VIII.

===Duchess of Brittany and remarriage===
When Charles VIII died as the result of an accident on 4 April 1498, Anne was 21 years old and without surviving children. She then personally took charge of the administration of the Duchy of Brittany. She restored the faithful Philippe de Montauban to the chancellery of Brittany, named Jean de Châlon, Prince of Orange, as Hereditary Lieutenant General of Brittany, appointed her squire Gilles of Texue as responsible of the Château de Brest, convened the Estates of Brittany, and ordered production of a gold coin bearing her name.

Around her, there was a famous circle of court poets, among them the Italian humanist Publio Fausto Andrelini from Forlì (who spread the New Learning in France), historian Jean Lemaire de Belges and poet Jean Marot. She also took into her service the most famous musicians of her time: Johannes Ockeghem, Antoine de Févin, Loyset Compère and Jean Mouton. Anne of Brittany was undoubtedly the first Queen of France to appear as a patron sought after by artists and writers of her time.

Three days after her husband&#x27;s death, the terms of her marriage contract came into force; however, the new King, Louis XII, was already married to Joan, daughter of Louis XI and sister to Charles VIII. On 19 August 1498, at Étampes, Anne agreed to marry Louis XII if he obtained an annulment from Joan within a year. Days later, the process for the annulment of the marriage between Louis XII and Joan of France began. In the interim, Anne returned to Brittany in October 1498.

If Anne was gambling that the annulment would be denied, she lost: Louis&#x27;s first marriage was dissolved by Pope Alexander VI before the end of the year. Anne&#x27;s third marriage contract, signed the day of her marriage (Nantes, 7 January 1499), was concluded under conditions radically different from those of the second. She was no longer a child, but a Dowager Queen, and determined to ensure the recognition of her rights as sovereign Duchess from that point forward. Although her new husband exercised the ruler&#x27;s powers in Brittany, he formally recognized her right to the title &quot;Duchess of Brittany&quot; and issued decisions in her name. The contract also stipulated that, since Anne personally retained rights to the duchy, the couple&#x27;s second child, son or daughter, would be Anne&#x27;s own heir, thus keeping the duchy separate from the throne of France. This clause would not be respected. Anne&#x27;s second coronation ceremony as Louis XII&#x27;s consort took place on 18 November 1504, again at St. Denis Basilica.

Anne lived mainly at the Château de Blois, where the presence of the Duchess of Brittany was visible everywhere. She built the tomb of her parents at Nantes Cathedral (where her heart would also return under the terms of her last will) with the symbols of the four virtues: Courage, Temperance, Justice and Prudence, that she always tried to wear. All Italian arts were appreciated by the Queen. During an illness of Louis XII she made a tour of Brittany (not the Tro Breizh, contrary to what is often said).

As Duchess, Anne fiercely defended the independence of her Duchy. She arranged the marriage of her daughter, Claude, heiress of the Duchy, to Charles of Austria. This match would reinforce the Franco-Spanish alliance and ensure French success in the Italian Wars. The marriage contract was signed on 10 August 1501 in Lyon by François de Busleyden, Archbishop of Besançon, William de Croÿ, Nicolas de Rutter and Pierre Lesseman, all ambassadors of Duke Philip of Burgundy, Charles&#x27; father. Louis XII assented to this plan publicly, but in private worked to match Claude with the heir to the French throne, Francis of Angoulême. Every time Louis&#x27; precarious health threatened his death, steps were taken to cement this match between Claude and Francis. Anne, determined to maintain Breton independence, refused to sanction the marriage until her death, pushing instead for Claude to marry Charles, or for her other daughter, Renée, to inherit the Duchy. When Louis XII definitively settled their daughters&#x27; dispositions counter to her wishes, Anne left his side to tour the Duchy, visiting many places she had never been able to see as a child. Officially, it was a pilgrimage to the Breton shrines in thanks for one of Louis&#x27; recent recoveries, but in reality it was a political journey: an act of independence that sought to assert her sovereignty within the marriage. Letters imply how much Louis took her absence to heart: according to a July letter from Louise of Savoy to Michelle de Saubonne, Louis &quot;could not be more anxious&quot; for Anne&#x27;s return and &quot;is as wretched as can be without her.&quot; By September, he is reported as asking about her return at least six times a day. From June to September 1505, she made triumphal entries into the cities of the Duchy, where her vassals received her sumptuously. In addition, she ensured the proper collection of taxes.

==Death==
Exhausted by many pregnancies and miscarriages, Anne died of a kidney-stone attack in the Château de Blois at 6 a.m. on 9 January 1514, after having dictated in her will the customary partition of her body (&quot;dilaceratio corporis&quot;, &quot;division of the body&quot; in heart, entrails and bones) with multiple burials, a privilege of the Capetian dynasty, which allowed for multiple ceremonies (funerals of the body – the most important – and heart) and places (the burial of the body and heart). Anne&#x27;s will also conferred the succession of Brittany upon her second daughter, Renée. Her husband ignored this, confirmed Claude as Duchess, put her under the guardianship of Anne&#x27;s political rival, Louise of Savoy, and married her to Francis, Louise&#x27;s son, in the year following Anne&#x27;s death. When Francis became king in 1515, the Duchy of Brittany was once again the property of the queen consort of France.

She was buried in the necropolis of Saint Denis. Her funeral was exceptionally long, lasting 40 day. The Herald of arms of Brittany Pierre Choqué pronounced for the first time the traditional lament: &quot;La reine est morte!, la reine est morte!, la reine est morte!&quot; (The Queen is dead!, The Queen is dead!, The Queen is dead!). Choqué, in his record of Anne&#x27;s funeral commissioned by Louis XII, &quot;Récit des Funérailles d&#x27;Anne de Bretagne,&quot; recorded that two Masses were read, the first by the &quot;Cordeliers&quot; (i.e., Franciscans) and the second by the Jacobins (i.e., Dominicans). Two requiems were also sung, possibly those that survive by Johannes Prioris and Antoine de Févin. Separate mourning motets by other members of the two royal choirs also survive: &quot;Quis dabit oculis&quot; by Costanzo Festa and &quot;Fiere attropos&quot; by Pierre Moulu.
In accordance to her will, Anne&#x27;s heart was placed in a raised enamel gold reliquary before it was transported to Nantes to be deposited in her parents&#x27; tomb in the chapel of the Carmelite friars. This was done on 19 March 1514, but it was later transferred to the Saint-Pierre Cathedral. Anne&#x27;s reliquary is a bivalvular box oval articulated by a hinge, made of a sheet of gold pushed back and guillochéd, broadside of a gold and topped by a crown of lily and clover. It is inscribed on the obverse as follows:

:&quot;En ce petit vaisseau &quot;
:&quot;De fin or pur et munde &quot;
:&quot;Repose ung plus grand cueur &quot;
:&quot;Que oncque dame eut au munde&quot;

:&quot;Anne fut le nom delle&quot;
:&quot;En France deux fois royne&quot;
:&quot;Duchesse des Bretons&quot;
:&quot;Royale et Souveraine.&quot;

It was made by anonymous goldsmiths of the court of Blois, and has been attributed to Geoffroy Jacquet and Pierre Mangot working to the designs of Jean Perréal. In 1792, by order of the National Convention, the reliquary was disinterred and emptied as part of the collection of precious metals belonging to churches. It was sent to Paris to be melted down, but was kept instead in the National Library. It was returned to Nantes in 1819 and kept in various museums; it has been in the Dobrée Museum since 1896. This relic was stolen 13 April 2018 from the Thomas-Dobree museum in Nantes, France. It was recovered undamaged later that month

The double mausoleum Louis XII and Anne of Brittany, carved in Carrara marble, was unveiled at Saint Denis Basilica in 1531. The baldachin was in arcades, while the base of the sarcophagus depicted the victories of Louis XII (Battle of Agnadello, the triumphal entry into Milan), statues of the Twelve Apostles and the four Cardinal virtues, the work of the Juste brothers, Italian sculptors who received the order in 1515. The &quot;transi&quot; (whose realism was so shocking that it included an open abdomen stitched after the extraction of the entrails) and orans before a Prie-dieu crowning the platform are attributed to Guillaume Regnault. The tomb was desecrated during the Revolution on 18 October 1793 and the bodies were thrown into a mass grave. Alexandre Lenoir saved much of the monument, which was preserved in the Museum of French Monuments in 1795 before being returned to the Royal Basilica under the Second Bourbon Restoration.

==Personal characteristics==

Anne was a highly intelligent woman who spent much of her time on the administration of Brittany. She was described as shrewd, proud and haughty in manner. She made the safeguarding of Breton autonomy, and the preservation of the Duchy outside the French crown, her life&#x27;s work, although that goal would prove to have failed shortly after her death.

Anne was also a patron of the arts and enjoyed music. A prolific collector of tapestries, it is very likely that the unicorn tapestries now on view at The Cloisters museum in New York City were commissioned by her in celebration of her wedding to Louis XII. Of her four surviving illuminated manuscript books of hours the most famous is the Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany. She also supported printed books and their authors, for example commissioning a more modern French version, for print, of Christine of Pizan&#x27;s book &quot;The City of Ladies&quot;, of a century earlier.

She was a devoted mother, spending as much time as possible with her children. She commissioned a book of prayers for her son, Charles-Orland, to use in teaching him how to pray, and as guidance for his role as future King of France. Unfortunately, Charles-Orland died in 1495, and no other son lived more than a few weeks. She also commissioned a primer, yet extant, for her then 8-year-old daughter Claude. The prevalence of Anne&#x27;s own coat of arms in the illumination, rather than Louis&#x27;s, marks this book as a mechanism of transmission of values inter-generationally from mother to daughter, and from queen to queen. Claude, in turn, commissioned another such book for her younger sister, Renée, whom she raised after Anne&#x27;s death. The contents of these books produced specifically for childrenLatin, Biblical scenes, models of proper female behaviorgive insight into the priorities of the Princesses&#x27; childhood education.

According to the memoirs of Brantôme, Anne greatly expanded her household and retinue at court, especially in respect to young girls, forming a kind of finishing school, and in having a company of 100 Breton gentlemen at court. These innovations influenced later French courts.

At her marriage to Charles VIII at age 14, Anne was described as a young and rosy-cheeked girl. By the time of her marriage to Louis, aged 22, after six pregnancies with no surviving children, she was described as pale-faced and wan. By the end of her life, at 36, she had been pregnant at least 11 times, from which only two children survived to adulthood.

Anne was trained from a young age to hide her limp, caused by a difference in the length of her legs, linked to a congenital displacement of her hips. She wore special heeled shoes to aid in smoothing her gait. She passed this limp on to her daughter, Claude.

==Issue==
Her marriage with Charles VIII of France produced six documented pregnancies:
* Charles Orland, Dauphin of France (11 October 1492 – 16 December 1495). Her only healthy son, born when Anne was 15, he died of the measles when three years old. Buried at Tours Cathedral.
* Francis (August 1493). Anne had become pregnant in late 1492/early 1493, but travelled with her husband from castle to castle; she went into labour during a drive in the forest of Courcelles, and the child was premature and stillborn. Buried at Notre-Dame de Cléry.
* Stillborn daughter (March 1495). She had become pregnant again in late 1494, but lost the child soon after.
* Charles, Dauphin of France (8 September 1496 – 2 October 1496). His death prompted Anne to withdraw temporarily to Moulins in despair. Buried at Tours Cathedral.
* Francis, Dauphin of France (July 1497). He died several hours after his birth. Buried at Tours Cathedral.
* Anne of France (20 March 1498). She died on the day of her birth at Château de Plessis-lez-Tours. Buried at Tours Cathedral.

Her marriage with Louis XII of France, produced at least another five recorded pregnancies:
* Claude of France (13 October 1499 – 20 July 1524), who succeeded her as Duchess of Brittany and later also became Queen consort of France as wife of Francis I.
* Son ([late 1500/early 1501] – died young).
* Stillborn son (21 January [1503/07]). 
* Renée of France (25 October 1510 – 12 June 1574), married Ercole II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, and became Duchess of Chartres and Lady of Montargis on the occasion of her wedding.
* Stillborn son (January [1513]).

Each miscarriage or stillbirth is said to have delighted the ambitious Louise of Savoy, whose son Francis was the heir presumptive under the Salic law. There even existed contemporary rumours that Louise used witchcraft to kill Anne&#x27;s sons.

Through her granddaughter Margaret, Duchess of Savoy (Claude&#x27;s youngest daughter), Anne of Brittany was the ancestor of Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice, head of the House of Savoy and the current pretender to the throne of Italy. Through her great-granddaughter Claude, Duchess of Lorraine (daughter of Henry II of France), Anne is also the ancestor of Karl von Habsburg, the current head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

Through her granddaughter Anna d&#x27;Este (Renée&#x27;s eldest daughter), Anne of Brittany is also the ancestor of the House of Guise and Savoy-Nemours.
==Emblems and mottos==
Anne had inherited from her predecessors the Breton dynastic emblems: a bandwidth Ermine (from John V), a simple Ermine (from John III) and a cord (from Francis II). As a widow of Charles VIII, and inspired by her father, she founded in 1498 the Order of the Ladies of the Cord.

As a personal emblem, she also used the letter &quot;A&quot; crowned, with the motto &quot;Non mudera&quot; (&quot;I will not change&quot;) and a particular form of the father&#x27;s cord, knotted at 8. Her emblems were joined in the decoration of her castles and manuscripts with those of her husbands: the flaming sword of Charles VIII and the porcupine of Louis XII. She also used the motto &quot;Potius Mori Quam Foedari&quot; (&quot;Rather die than dishonor&quot;) (in Breton &quot;Kentoc&#x27;h mervel eget bezañ saotret&quot;).

This could be found in many places related to her functions as Duchess or Queen:

*wall covering of the burial in Solesmes Abbey, by Michel Colombe, 1496.
*stained glass at Ervy-le-Châtel church, 1515.
*stained glass at the town hall of Étampes, 1853.

==The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries==
There is unproven speculation that the tapestries &quot;The Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; relate to her marriage to King Louis.

==Representations and social legacy==

Even while she was alive, the royal propaganda of Charles VIII and of Louis XII depicted Anne of Brittany as a perfect queen, a symbol of union and peace between the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Brittany (the popular tradition of the &quot;&quot;Good Duchess&quot;). In the following centuries, historians and popular culture sometimes presented Anne of Brittany in differing fashions, ascribing to her physical and psychological characteristics that are not necessarily supported by historical evidence.

After her death, she was gradually forgotten until the mid-19th century. After the foundation of the Breton Association in 1843, Breton regionalists sought a figure which could embody their ideal of agrarian and regional renewal, while expressing their attachment to the French nation. Their choice was Anne of Brittany (hence the legend of the &quot;Duchess in clogs&quot;).

Many myths now surround Anne of Brittany, as a woman forced into an arranged marriage with Charles VIII, the Duchess of Brittany committed to the independence and happiness of her country, or otherwise of a Queen symbol of union and peace between Brittany and France. It has become an issue between those Breton historians pursuing a mythologizing of their past, and those forging a national historiography with the myth of a French nation one and indivisible.

This symbolism explains the release of fifty books during the last 200 years giving contrasting visions of Anne: at one extreme there is Georges Minois, who presented her as a person &quot;limited, petty and vindictive&quot;, and at the other Philippe Tourault, who gave her a &quot;quite richly and favorable personality, ardently attached to her country and people&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="642218" wikidata="Q5451218" url="?curid=642218" title="Firangoji Narsala">
<text>Firangoji Narsala was a Maratha warrior and military leader in the army of Shivaji Maharaj, in 17th century India. He is famous for his defence of Sangram Durg, a fort, against a Mughal army led by Shaista Khan in 1660 .
Firangoji was a &#x27;Killedar&#x27; (fortress commander) of this fort in Chakan (Pune). When Shaista Khan invaded Pune with a lakh of soldiers, he selected Sangram Durga as the first target. He attacked the fort with 20,000 soldiers on 23 June 1660.

==Battle of Chakan==
Firangoji Narasala was prepared for this attack, however, even though he had only 320 soldiers. Just before this attack Shivaji Maharaj had asked his commander to leave the fort. However, Firangoji decided not to abandon the fort and instead started a fierce guerrilla war against the Mughals and defended the fort in this way for 56 days. War ended on 14 August 1660.

The Mughals tried another way of taking the fort. They dug a tunnel up to the fort; which was a challenge because of the water around it. They filled this tunnel with explosives and blew up the wall of the fort. This was a major setback for Firangoji and his soldiers; 75 soldiers died in this attack. The Mughal army rushed into the fort; fierce fighting ensued and many Maratha soldiers were killed.

Shaista Khan was astonished by Firangoji&#x27;s bravery, and offered him Mughal Sardari. But Firangoji refused to accept it; instead Shaista Khan gave him and his soldiers safe passage. Firangoji came to meet Shivaji and apologised for surrendering the fort. But Shivaji was very happy with him as he had defended a small fort for almost 2 months. He said &quot;if it took 60 days for Shaista Khan to take a small fort, imagine how many days will be required to capture an entire swarajya (kingdom). Shaista Khan will be here for few days, he is not going to take Sangram Durg with him. Whatever you have done is praiseworthy&quot;.

<text>Hoodia (; known locally as &quot;ghaap&quot; or &quot;bobbejaanghaap&quot;) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, under the subfamily Asclepiadoideae, native to Southern Africa.

One species of &quot;Hoodia&quot; in particular, &quot;Hoodia gordonii&quot;, has achieved a degree of fame and controversy, after being investigated for use as a possible appetite suppressant.

==Description==
The group was first described as a genus in 1844.

Hoodia are stem succulents, described as &quot;cactiform&quot; because of their remarkable similarity to the unrelated cactus family. They have a branching, shrub-like form, and the largest species (&quot;Hoodia parviflora&quot;) can grow to the size of a tree — over in height.

The flowers are extremely variable in size — from less than 1 cm, to almost 20 cm in diameter, depending on the species. Flowers appear in large numbers, always near the tops of the stems. Those of larger-flowered species (such as &quot;Hoodia gordonii&quot;) are often a papery pink-tan colour, plate-shaped, with an unpleasant smell to attract their fly pollinators. The smaller, darker flowers of some species have a far stronger and more unpleasant smell than the larger flowers.

==Distribution==
The genus &quot;Hoodia&quot; is restricted to the arid regions in the western part of southern Africa, ranging from western South Africa to central Namibia and as far north as southern Angola. It is especially common in the Namib desert and in the Orange River valley. Typical habitat is rocky slopes and open stone plains. Plants usually germinate in the shelter of bushes or rocks, but survive in the open as adult plants.

;Species
Several of the small-flowered species of &quot;Hoodia&quot; were formerly in a separate genus, &quot;Trichocaulon&quot; (&quot;ghaap&quot;), but have been moved into the genus &quot;Hoodia&quot;, and the two groups are now synonymous. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus &quot;Hoodia&quot; to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the stapeliad genus &quot;Lavrania&quot;. Marginally more distantly related is a sister branch of related genera including &quot;Larryleachia&quot;, &quot;Richtersveldia&quot; and &quot;Notechidnopsis&quot;.

==Uses and horticulture==
===Supplement===
&quot;Hoodia gordonii&quot; is traditionally used by the San people (Bushmen) of the Namib desert as an appetite suppressant as part of their indigenous knowledge about survival in the harsh desert conditions. In 2006, the plant became internationally known, after a marketing campaign falsely claimed that its use as a dietary supplement was an appetite suppressant for weight loss. As of 2018, there is no high-quality clinical research showing that hoodia has actions as an appetite suppressant or is effective for weight loss.

In a case of biopiracy, bioprospectors from South Africa&#x27;s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) realized that the plant was marketable and patented its use as an appetite suppressant without recognizing the Sans&#x27; traditional claims to the knowledge of the plant and its uses. The patent was later sold to Unilever, which marketed hoodia products as diet supplements. In 2003, the South African San Council entered into a benefit sharing agreement with CSIR in which they would receive from 6 to 8% of the revenue from the sale of &quot;H. gordonii&quot; products, money which would be deposited in a trust for all San peoples across Southern Africa.

===Horticulture===
Several species are grown as garden plants, and one species, &quot;H. gordonii&quot;, is being investigated for use as an appetite suppressant. However, in 2008, UK-based Unilever PLC, one of the largest packaged-food firms in the world, abandoned plans to use hoodia in a range of diet products. In a document on Unilever&#x27;s website entitled &quot;Sustainable Development 2008: An Overview&quot;, signed by Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever states: &quot;During 2008, having invested 20 million [pounds] in R&amp;D, Unilever abandoned plans to use the slimming extract hoodia in a range of diet products. We stopped the project because our clinical studies revealed that products using hoodia would not meet our strict standards of safety and efficacy.&quot;

Many &quot;Hoodia&quot; species are protected plants. &quot;Hoodia&quot; is currently listed in Appendix II to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which includes species not currently considered endangered but are at risk if trade is not controlled.

<text>The Nguni is a cattle breed indigenous to Southern Africa. A hybrid of different Indian and later European cattle breeds, they were introduced by pastoralist tribes ancestral to modern Nguni people to Southern Africa during their migration from the North of the continent. Nguni cattle are dairy and beef cattle. 

The cattle breed is medium-sized and adapted to grazing on the highveld.

==Characteristics==
Nguni cattle are known for their fertility and resistance to diseases, being the favourite and most beloved breed amongst the local Bantu-speaking people of southern Africa (South Africa, Eswatini, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Angola). They are characterised by their multicoloured skin, which can present many different patterns, but their noses are always black-tipped. 

They are a principal form of Sanga cattle, which originated as hybrids of Zebu and humpless cattle in East Africa. DNA analyses have confirmed that they are a combination of &quot;Bos indicus&quot; and &quot;Bos taurus&quot;, that is a combination of different Zebu and European cattle breeds. 

They are characterised by low cervicothoracic humps, in front of the front legs, instead of the high thoracic humps of pure Zebu. Besides the various colour patterns, these animals present a variety of horn shapes. 

All different combinations were catalogued in the beginning of the century by a South African herdmaster. This work inspired the &quot;Nguni Cattle Register&quot;, a compilation of terms to describe in full a Nguni cow or bull. The cattle are medium-sized, with bulls weighing between 500 and 600 kg, while cows weigh between 300 and 400 kg.

==Origins==
The ancestors of Nguni cattle were brought by ancestors of Nguni (Zulu, Xhosa, Ndebele, Swazi people, etc.), during their postulated migration to the south of Africa.
