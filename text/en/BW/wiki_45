<text>A United States military occupation code, or a military occupational specialty code (MOS code), is a nine-character code used in the United States Army and United States Marine Corps to identify a specific job. In the United States Air Force, a system of Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) is used. In the United States Navy, a system of naval ratings and designators are used along with the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) system. A system of ratings is also used in the United States Coast Guard.

Since an individual can obtain multiple job specialties, a duty military occupational specialty (DMOS) is used to identify what their primary job function is at any given time. An individual must complete and pass all required training for their military occupational specialty qualification (MOSQ).

==Army==
===World War Two (1942–1946)===
Originally, the four-digit MOS code mostly listed the recruit&#x27;s civilian profession. This was to aid in classifying what military job they could be assigned. With so many recruits being processed, identifying any semi-skilled or skilled civilian tradesmen made it easier to match them with the right military job. There was an additional list of military trades and trainings added so a trained soldier could be assigned to the right unit. There were no grouping of similar trades together, making it hard for someone to know the meaning of an MOS code without a manual.

===Post-War reform===
The MOS system now had five digits, with a period after the third digit. The first four-digit code number indicated the soldier&#x27;s job; the first two digits were the field code, the third digit was the sub-specialty and the fourth code number (separated by a period) was the job title. A fifth code digit was for the soldier&#x27;s special qualification identifier (SQI) digit, which indicated what specialized training the soldier had. If the soldier did not have an SQI, the digit was listed as &quot;0&quot; or was omitted. The codes for the civilian trades were removed as unnecessary. 
;Examples:
:11 (One-one) is the field code for infantry, 1.1 is the sub-specialty of light weapons, and 7 is the SQI for airborne training. Therefore, 111.10 is the MOS for an infantryman and 111.17 is for an airborne-qualified paratrooper.
:91 (Nine-one) was the old field code for the medical field, 912.0 was the MOS for medical NCO and 912.00 was a generalist medical NCO with no SQI.

===1964 reform===
In 1964 the system was revamped. There were completely different codes for enlisted / non-commissioned officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers.

Enlisted and NCO personnel had a five-symbol code. The first four code symbols were made up of a two-digit code for the career field, a letter code for the field specialty, and a number code (1 to 5) indicating level of instruction in their field specialty. The fifth code symbol was an SQI code letter indicating training in a special skill (the letter &quot;O&quot; indicating that the soldier had no SQI). An exception to the 5-symbol rule was made for an SQI which indicated language fluency. In this case, 7 symbols were used, with &quot;L&quot; as the language qualification indicator, followed by two characters indicating the specific language.

Warrant officers also had a five-symbol code but it was different. The first three numbers were the career field, then a letter code for the field specialty, and ended in the SQI code letter.

Officers had a four-digit code number for their career field and specialty. Officers with a special qualification also had an SQI code number prefix to their MOS rather than a code letter suffix. Officers without a special qualification had no prefix number.

===1983 reform===
In 1983, there was a reform of this system. Some of the field code numbers were changed and the MOS codes were streamlined.

Warrant officers and officers received the same career field codes as enlisted and NCO personnel and ended in the same SQI letter codes. Warrant officers received a five-symbol MOS consisting of a four-symbol field specialty code consisting of the two-digit field code, a one-digit sub-field code number (usually &quot;0&quot;), the field specialty code letter, and followed by the SQI code letter. Officers now had a four-symbol alphanumeric MOS. It consisted of the three-symbol field specialty code of two numbers and a specialty code letter and ended in the SQI letter code.

The field code &quot;18&quot; was created for US Army Special Forces, which are now considered part of the regular US Army. Previously they had been considered a layer between the intelligence services and the army. The 18A was for special forces officers and 180A was for special forces warrant officers. The 18X was for special forces candidates who had not yet passed the &quot;Q&quot; course. The &quot;A&quot; team leaders had to be captains instead of lieutenants and were rotated to conventional postings.

Certain field specialty code letters were reserved. The &quot;X&quot; was for recruits or candidates who have pre-selected a career field but had not graduated from AIT. The &quot;Z&quot; is for senior NCOs of E8 or E9 grade. The &quot;A&quot; is for officers and warrant officers in a general capacity. Specialist officers and warrant officers have other field code letters reserved for them.

===Current version===
The list of US Army military occupational specialty codes is published on the United States Army Human Resources Command (HRC) PAMXXI website.

===Enlisted personnel===
The MOS code (MOSC), consisting of nine characters, provides more information than a soldier&#x27;s MOS. It is used by automated management systems and reports. The MOSC is used with active and reserve records, reports, authorization documents, and other personnel management systems.

The elements of the MOSC are as follows:

* First three characters: the MOS. The first two characters are always numbers, but the third character is always a letter. The two-digit number is usually (but not always) synonymous with the career management field (CMF). For example, CMF 11 covers infantry, so MOS 11B is &quot;rifle infantryman&quot;. Among the letters, &quot;Z&quot; is reserved for &quot;senior sergeant&quot; (E-8), such that 11Z is &quot;senior infantry sergeant&quot;.
* The fourth character of the MOSC represents skill level (commensurate with rank and grade):
** &quot;0&quot; is used to identify personnel undergoing training for award of a primary MOS (PMOS).
** &quot;1&quot; identifies a private (PVT) through specialist (SPC/pay grade E-4) or corporal (CPL/also pay grade E-4)
** &quot;2&quot; identifies a sergeant (SGT/pay grade E-5)
** &quot;3&quot; identifies a staff sergeant (SSG/pay grade E-6)
** &quot;4&quot; identifies a sergeant first class (SFC/pay grade E-7)
** &quot;5&quot; identifies a master sergeant (MSG) or first sergeant (1SG) (see E-8, below)
** &quot;6&quot; identifies a sergeant major (SGM/pay grade E-9) or command sergeant major (CSM/pay grade E-9) (as of 1 April 2011) 
* Fifth character: a letter or number and a special qualification identifier (SQI). It may be associated with any MOS unless otherwise specified. Only Enlisted Soldiers without any special SQI are assigned the SQI &quot;O&quot; (oscar), often confused with a zero. Warrant Officers without any special SQI are assigned the SQI &quot;0&quot; zero.
* Sixth and seventh characters: an additional skill identifier (ASI). They are an alphanumeric combination and may only be associated with specified MOSs, although in practice some ASIs are available to every MOS (e.g. ASI P5 for &quot;master fitness trainer&quot;). Soldiers without any ASIs are assigned the default ASI of &quot;mk lmk00&quot; (zero-zero).
* Eighth and ninth characters: two-letter requirements and qualifications which are a language identification code (LIC). Soldiers without a language skill are assigned the default LIC &quot;YY&quot; (Yankee-Yankee). Language identification codes can be found in AR 611–6.

====MOSC for E-8 and above====
When an enlisted soldier is promoted from sergeant first class to master sergeant in most career types, that soldier will be reclassified administratively to the &quot;senior sergeant&quot; of their career management field. For example, a combat engineer (MOS 12B, part of CMF 12) is promoted from sergeant first class to master sergeant. That soldier is reclassified administratively from MOS 12B to MOS 12Z &quot;senior engineer sergeant&quot;). An example of when this conversion occurs at the MSG to SGM level is the 68 (formerly the 91) CMF. In this case, the soldier becomes a 68Z at the SGM level, not the MSG level. When promoted from master sergeant or first sergeant or sergeant major to command sergeant major, that soldier will be reclassified administratively from their previous &quot;senior sergeant&quot; MOS to the MOS 00Z (zero-zero-zulu), &quot;command sergeant major&quot;. Some MOS do not change though, for example 25U starts out as 25U1O (E1-E4), and advances though 25U2O (E5/SGT), 25U3O (E6/SSG), 25U4O (E7/SFC), and 25U5O (E8, E9/MSG, 1SG, SGM, CSM)

===Warrant officers===
Warrant officers are sometimes specialized technicians and systems managers, and were not originally assigned to traditional arms or services of the Army. Approximately 50% of warrant officers are aviators (aircraft pilots, rotary wing and fixed wing), and can be appointed directly from civilian life or within the service, regardless of previous enlisted MOS. The remaining 50% are technicians appointed from experienced enlisted soldiers and NCOs in a &quot;feeder&quot; MOS directly related to the warrant officer MOS.

During 2004, all army warrant officers began wearing the insignia of their specialty&#x27;s proponent branch rather than the 83-year-old &quot;Eagle Rising&quot; distinctive warrant officer insignia. The following year, a revision of commissioned officer professional development and career management integrated warrant officer career development with the officer career development model. In practice, warrant officer MOSC are very similar to enlisted codes except they begin with three digits instead of two before the first letter, and do not have a &quot;skill level&quot; identifier. They are then followed by the SQI, ASI, and SLI as an enlisted MOS would be.

===Officers===
Commissioned officers&#x27; occupational codes are structured somewhat differently. A newly commissioned army officer first receives a &quot;career branch&quot;. This is similar to the career management field of the enlisted personnel. Career branch numbers range from 11 to 92. For example: 13 for field artillery, 19 for armor/armored cavalry and 92 for quartermaster. Within each occupational field, there are usually several codes available. Within armor (branch 19) there are three specialties available: 19A (armor, general), 19B (armor), and 19C (cavalry). After an officer&#x27;s fifth or sixth year of service, he or she may receive a &quot;functional area&quot; designation. More specific than a career branch, this is a specific skill set in which the officer is proficient. For example, an artillery officer who has had schooling in communications and public speaking could end up with a functional area in public affairs (FA46).

==Marine Corps==

The U.S. Marine Corps begins by separating all jobs into &quot;occupational fields&quot; (OccFld), in which no distinction is made between officers and enlisted Marines. The fields are numbered from 01 to 99 and include general categories (intelligence, infantry, logistics, public affairs, ordnance, etc.) under which specific jobs fall.

Each field contains multiple MOS&#x27;s, each designated by a four-digit numerical indicator and a job title. Most fields have at least one &quot;basic MOS&quot; for enlisted, and one &quot;basic MOS&quot; for officers, who have yet to be fully trained in any other MOS within that field. Upon completion of required training, the Marine is reclassified from their &quot;basic MOS&quot; to a &quot;primary MOS&quot; in which Marines generally will serve the remainder of their careers, be assigned, seek promotion, and be retained.

Additionally, many fields have specialty MOS&#x27;s, such as &quot;necessary MOS&#x27;s&quot;, for which there may be varying prerequisites and assignment criterion. Marines do not compete for promotion or retention based on their NMOS, only their PMOS (or basic MOS, for those who have yet to complete training for a PMOS). A Marine who earns an NMOS retains it in their service records as an additional MOS beyond their PMOS, and multiple NMOS&#x27;s (and PMOS&#x27;s, in some cases) may be earned showing additional skills.

For example, the infantry field (03) has multiple enlisted classifications:

* basic infantry Marine (Basic MOS 0300),
* rifleman (Primary MOS 0311), 
* light armored reconnaissance Marine (Primary MOS 0313), 
* combat rubber reconnaissance craft (CRRC) coxswain (Necessary MOS 0316), 
* scout sniper (Necessary MOS 0317), 
* reconnaissance Marine (Primary MOS 0321), 
* reconnaissance Marine (parachute qualified) (Necessary MOS 0323), 
* reconnaissance Marine (combatant diver qualified) (Necessary MOS 0324), 
* reconnaissance Marine (parachute and combatant diver qualified) (Necessary MOS 0326), 
* machine gunner (Primary MOS 0331), 
* mortarman (Primary MOS 0341), 
* infantry assault Marine (Primary MOS 0351), 
* antitank missile gunner (Primary MOS 0352), 
* light armored reconnaissance leader (Primary MOS 0363), 
* infantry squad leader (Primary MOS 0365), 
* light armored reconnaissance master gunner (Necessary MOS 0367), 
* infantry unit leader (Primary MOS 0369), 
* critical skills operator (Primary MOS 0372), 
* light armored reconnaissance operations chief (Primary MOS 0393), and 
* operations chief (Primary MOS 0399).

Each of the jobs have authorized ranks associated with them. For example, anyone ranking from private to sergeant can be a rifleman (0311), but only Marines ranking from staff sergeant to gunnery sergeant can be an infantry unit leader (0369).

Duties and tasks are identified by rank because the Marine Corps MOS system is designed around the belief that increased duties and tasks accompany promotions. The first two digits designate the field and, the last two digits identify the promotional channel and specialty.

For example, the MOS 0311 indicates that it is in occupational field 03 (infantry) and designates the &quot;rifleman&quot; (11) MOS. For warrant officers, the MOS 2305 indicates that it is in occupational field 23 (ammunition and explosive ordnance disposal) and designates the &quot;explosive ordnance disposal officer&quot; (05) MOS. For officers, the MOS 0802 indicates that it is in occupational field 08 (field artillery) and designates the &quot;field artillery officer&quot; (02) MOS.

==Navy==

On September 29, 2016, the Navy announced it would &quot;modernize&quot; all rating titles for Sailors with a new classification system that would move towards occupational specialty codes similar to how the other services operate.

Former Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Michael Stevens led the controversial review earlier that year for the Secretary of the Navy on behalf of Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral John Richardson.

Initially, the Navy Rating Modernization System eliminated all rating titles. The former Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, Steven S. Giordano, said:

&quot;Sailors would no longer be called, &#x27;Yeoman Second Class&#x27; or YN2, for example,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead they will be &#x27;Second Class Petty Officer, or &#x27;Petty Officer&#x27;. However, Sailors&#x27; ranks will not change: an E-7 will remain a Chief Petty Officer and an E-3 will remain a Seaman. Additionally, there will no longer be a distinction between &#x27;airman, fireman and seaman.&#x27;&quot;

The fleet at large did not respond to this favorably. As a result, Admiral Richardson rescinded this change on December 21, 2016, restoring all rating titles.

However, the plan retains the goal of producing sailors with more than one NOS, which might give them a broader range of professional experience and expertise and will be grouped under career fields that will enable flexibility to move between occupational specialties within the fields and will be tied to training and qualifications.

The transformation will occur in phases over a multi-year period and the Chief of Naval Personnel will lead the implementation efforts

The United States Navy has not released its NOS details yet and has not changed &quot;designators&quot; for officers.

===Enlisted personnel ratings===

The Navy indicates its &quot;ratings&quot; by a two or three character code based on the actual name of the rating. These range from ABE (aviation boatswain&#x27;s mate – equipment) to YN (Yeoman). Each sailor and chief petty officer wears a rating badge indicating their rating as part of their rate (rank) insignia on full dress and service dress uniforms.

===Commissioned officer designators===

The navy officer &quot;designator&quot; is similar to an MOS but is less complicated and has fewer categories. For example, a surface warfare officer with a regular commission has a designator of 1110; a reserve officer has an 1115 designator. A reserve surface warfare officer specializing in nuclear training (i.e., engineer on a carrier) has a designator of 1165N. Navy officers also have one or more three-character additional qualification designators (AQD) that reflect completion of requirements qualifying them in a specific warfare area or other specialization. In some senses this functions more like the MOS in other services. An officer with the naval aviator designator of 1310 might have an AQD of DV3, SH-60F carrier anti-submarine warfare helicopter pilot, or DB4, F-14 fighter pilot. An officer designated 2100, medical corps officer (physician) may hold an AQD of 6CM, trauma surgeon, or 6AE, flight surgeon who is also a naval aviator. Some AQDs may be possessed by officers in any designator, such as BT2, freefall parachutist, or BS1, shipboard Tomahawk strike officer. Navy officer designators and AQD codes may be found in NAVPERS 15839I, &quot;The Manual of Navy Officer Manpower and Personnel Classification&quot;.ip

==Coast Guard==
The United States Coast Guard does not use the military occupational specialty concept either, instead dividing their occupational specialties into groups such as aviation, administrative and scientific, deck and weapons, and engineering and hull. Their rating system is very similar to the US Navy (e.g., BM, boatswain&#x27;s mate).

===Enlisted personnel ratings===

The Coast Guard indicates its &quot;ratings&quot; by a two or three character code based on the actual name of the rating. These range from AMT (aviation maintenance technician) to YN (yeoman). Coast Guardsmen wear a rating badge indicating their rating as part of their rate (rank) insignia on full dress and service dress uniforms.

==Air Force==

The Air Force utilizes a similar system, but titled &quot;Air Force Specialty Code&quot; (AFSC). Enlisted airmen have a five digit code, and officers have a four digit code.

<doc id="644677" wikidata="Q5161070" url="?curid=644677" title="Conifold">
<text>In mathematics and string theory, a conifold is a generalization of a manifold. Unlike manifolds, conifolds can contain conical singularities, i.e. points whose neighbourhoods look like cones over a certain base. In physics, in particular in flux compactifications of string theory, the base is usually a five-dimensional real manifold, since the typically considered conifolds are complex 3-dimensional (real 6-dimensional) spaces.

==Overview==
Conifolds are important objects in string theory: Brian Greene explains the physics of conifolds in Chapter 13 of his book &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;—including the fact that the space can tear near the cone, and its topology can change. This possibility was first noticed by and employed by to prove that conifolds provide a connection between all (then) known Calabi–Yau compactifications in string theory; this partially supports a conjecture by whereby conifolds connect all possible Calabi–Yau complex 3-dimensional spaces.

A well-known example of a conifold is obtained as a deformation limit of a quintic - i.e. a quintic hypersurface in the projective space formula_1. The space formula_1 has complex dimension equal to four, and therefore the space defined by the quintic (degree five) equations:

formula_3

in terms of homogeneous coordinates formula_4 on formula_1, for any fixed complex formula_6, has complex dimension three. This family of quintic hypersurfaces is the most famous example of Calabi–Yau manifolds. If the complex structure parameter formula_6 is chosen to become equal to one, the manifold described above becomes singular since the derivatives of the quintic polynomial in the equation vanish when all coordinates formula_4 are equal or their ratios are certain fifth roots of unity. The neighbourhood of this singular point looks like a cone whose base is topologically just.

In the context of string theory, the geometrically singular conifolds can be shown to lead to completely smooth physics of strings. The divergences are &quot;smeared out&quot; by D3-branes wrapped on the shrinking three-sphere in Type IIB string theory and by D2-branes wrapped on the shrinking two-sphere in Type IIA string theory, as originally pointed out by . As shown by , this provides the string-theoretic description of the topology-change via the conifold transition originally described by , who also invented the term &quot;conifold&quot; and the diagram

for the purpose. The two topologically distinct ways of smoothing a conifold are thus shown to involve replacing the singular vertex (node) by either a 3-sphere (by way of deforming the complex structure) or a 2-sphere (by way of a &quot;small resolution&quot;). It is believed that nearly all Calabi–Yau manifolds can be connected via these &quot;critical transitions&quot;, resonating with Reid&#x27;s conjecture.

<text>The Mataura River is in the Southland Region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is long.

==Description==
The river&#x27;s headwaters are located in the Eyre Mountains to the south of Lake Wakatipu. From there it flows southeast towards Gore, where it turns southward. It then passes through the town of Mataura, and enters the Pacific Ocean at Toetoes Bay on the southern coast of the South Island. Much of its channel is braided.

The Mataura is renowned as a source of brown trout, and is a popular fishing venue, including whitebaiting. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of the endangered black-billed gull.

==History==
Until about 18,000 years ago the Mataura drained Lake Wakatipu. The Kingston Flyer follows part of the former river bed, now blocked by glacial moraine.

For Māori, the Mataura was an important (traditional travel route) that provided direct access from Murihiku to Whakatipu Waimāori (Lake Wakatipu). The Mataura was a significant (food-gathering place) for local Kāi Tahu, and was tribally renowned for its abundance of (lamprey, &quot;Geotria australis&quot;). Kanakana are normally caught when climbing natural waterfalls, such as Te Au-nui-pihapiha-kanakana (Mataura Falls).

The Mataura, along with the three other main Southland rivers, the Waiau, Ōreti and Aparima, breached during the Southland floods of January 1984. Commercial and residential areas of the town of Mataura were particularly affected, including the pulp and paper plant.

<doc id="644684" wikidata="Q717856" url="?curid=644684" title="Darryl Sutter">
<text>Darryl John Sutter (born August 19, 1958) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former player. He most recently served as head coach of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is one of seven Sutter brothers, six of whom made the NHL (Brian, Darryl, Duane, Brent, Rich and Ron); all but Rich and Gary (the seventh Sutter brother) worked alongside Darryl in some capacity during his first tenure with the Flames.

As a player, Sutter, like his brothers, earned a reputation for high work ethic and aggressive, tough play as he suited up for more than 400 games. Sutter served as the captain of the Chicago Blackhawks for five years until injuries forced him to retire from professional hockey at age 28.

In addition to the Flames, Sutter has served as the head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks, San Jose Sharks, and Los Angeles Kings. He coached the Kings to Stanley Cup championships in 2012 and 2014 and is the winningest coach in their history. He also previously worked for the Flames in multiple capacities, serving as the team&#x27;s head coach from 2002 to 2006 and general manager between 2003 and 2010. Sutter rejoined the Flames in 2021 for his second stint as the team&#x27;s head coach.

==Playing career==
Sutter grew up playing hockey near his home of Viking, Alberta, and like his brother Brian Sutter he was coached and mentored by former NHL defenceman and Chicago Black Hawks coach Clem Loughlin.

Sutter received an offer to try out for the Red Deer Rustlers of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) following in Brian&#x27;s footsteps, the Rustlers served as the starting point for all six Sutter brothers. Sutter joined the Rustlers in 1974–75, and in his three seasons, Sutter scored 114 goals and compiled 306 points in 176 games while the Rustlers failed to make the playoffs in each of Sutter&#x27;s three seasons. Sutter&#x27;s 136 points in the 1975–76 season was good enough for third in league scoring, and the following season Sutter put up 133 points which led the AJHL. At the end of the 1976–77 season Sutter joined the Lethbridge Broncos of the Western Canadian Hockey League (WCHL), playing one regular season game and 15 playoff games. In the following season, Sutter appeared in 68 games for the Broncos, scoring 33 goals and compiling 81 points as the team finished first in the Central division. Despite a strong showing in the WCHL Sutter fell to the 11th round of the 1978 NHL Entry Draft where he was selected by the Chicago Black Hawks 179th overall. Sutter was dejected by his low draft position and felt an NHL career would not be possible. Pat Shimbashi the co-owner of the Lethbridge Broncos offered Sutter CA$13,000 to join the Iwakura Tomakomai of the Japan Ice Hockey League for the 1978–79 Season. Sutter put up 28 goals and 41 points in 20 games in the JPN, after which he returned to North America in February 1979 to join the Black Hawks American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate New Brunswick Hawks where the following season he was awarded the 1979–80 Dudley &quot;Red&quot; Garrett Memorial Award for AHL rookie of the year after scoring 35 goals and 66 points in 69 games.

===Chicago Blackhawks===
Standing at and weighing , Sutter made the jump to the NHL in the 1979–80 season, playing eight games and scoring his first NHL goal in December 16, 1979 in a 7–3 win over the Detroit Red Wings. In the 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs Sutter suited up for all seven games including a first-round three-game sweep victory over the St. Louis Blues captained by his older brother Brian. During the series, Darryl scored one goal and one assist, while Brian was held pointless in three games. The Black Hawks were subsequently eliminated in the second round in a four-game sweep loss to the Buffalo Sabres. In his first seven playoff games, Sutter scored three goals and one assist.

Sutter&#x27;s first complete season came in 1980–81 where he put up a career-high 40 goals and 62 points as the Black Hawks finished with the 10th best record in the NHL at 31–33–16. Among the highlights of the season included a hattrick in a 7–5 win over the Edmonton Oilers on October 18, 1981. Sutter&#x27;s 40 goals left him tied for 17th in scoring across the NHL, and he finishing fourth in the Calder Memorial Trophy voting. The Black Hawks were swept three games to zero by the Calgary Flames in the first round of the 1981 Stanley Cup playoffs.

In the 1981–82 season Sutter played 40 games scoring 23 goals and 12 assists. His season was shortened due to nagging injuries, however, Sutter headed into the playoffs healthy. The Black Hawks defeated the Minnesota North Stars three games to one and St. Louis Blues four games to two until losing to the Vancouver Canucks in five games. Sutter&#x27;s playoffs ended prematurely when he tripped on a coin tossed on the ice during game three of the North Stars series, suffering a separated shoulder and requiring surgery.

In the 1982–83 season the Chicago Black Hawks traded captain Terry Ruskowski to the Los Angeles Kings on October 24, and two months later coach Orval Tessier named Sutter team captain on December 10, 1982. Sutter finished 1982–83 with 31 goals and 30 assists in 80 games. In the 1983 Stanley Cup playoffs Sutter scored four goals and six assists as the Black Hawks defeated Brian Sutter&#x27;s St. Louis Blues three games to one, and the Minnesota North Stars four games to one, and eventually fell to the Edmonton Oilers in Conference finals in a four-game sweep. Sutter played through the playoffs with broken ribs.

In the 1983–84 season Sutter played 59 games due to injury while scoring 20 goals and 20 assists. Sutter missed a number of games after he was struck in the face by a deflected slapshot in a January 2 game against the Minnesota North Stars. Sutter&#x27;s left eye was knocked from the socket and he was rushed to the hospital where he spent four days recovering before returning to Chicago for surgery, and was out for six weeks. While in the Minnesota hospital, Sutter was visited daily by North Stars&#x27; head coach Glen Sonmor who suffered a career-ending injury under similar circumstances in 1954. The Black Hawks finished the season with a record of 30–42–8 and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in five games against the Minnesota North Stars.

In the 1984–85 season Sutter played 49 games due to injury while scoring 20 goals and 18 assists. Before the start of the season Sutter underwent knee surgery, and later in the season suffered a fractured ankle, and eventually fractured his ribs before the playoffs. In the 1985 Stanley Cup playoffs Sutter scored 12 goals and 7 assists in 15 games as the Chicago Black Hawks swept the Detroit Red Wings in a three games, followed by a six-game victory over the Minnesota North Stars in which Sutter scored two overtime game-winning goals during the series. Finally the Black Hawks were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers led by Wayne Gretzky, four games to two.

Once again in the 1985–86 season, Sutter failed to play a complete season, suiting up for 50 games once again due to injuries while scoring 17 goals and 10 assists. Sutter sat out the preseason with a knee injury and separated his shoulder in the November 14 game against the Quebec Nordiques. The Black Hawks finished the season 39–33–8 and fell to the Toronto Maple Leafs in a three-game sweep in the first round of the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs.

Sutter&#x27;s final NHL season came in 1986–87 where he scored eight goals and six assists in 44 games as the Chicago Blackhawks finished with a 29–37–14 record and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep. After the 1986–87 season Sutter announced his retirement from the NHL at the age of 28. Sutter noted his ongoing injuries had played a part in his decision as he failed to play more than 60 games in the previous four seasons. Sutter had contemplated retirement for the previous two seasons, and his decision was made following a standing offer by the Black Hawks general manager Bob Pulford to provide him with a job in the organization two years earlier.

Over his 406-game NHL career, Sutter exclusively played for the Chicago Blackhawks franchise scoring 161 goals, and 118 assists totaling 279 points and 288 penalty minutes, in addition to 24 goals, 19 assists, and 26 penalty minutes in 51 Stanley Cup playoff games. Owing to his early retirement and injuries, Sutter&#x27;s 406 games and 51 playoff games are both the lowest amongst the six Sutter brothers. Despite his low number of games Darryl averaged 0.397 goals per game, the highest amongst the Sutter brothers, slightly ahead of Brian&#x27;s 0.389.

==Coaching career==
===Early coaching career===
Sutter began his coaching career with the Chicago Blackhawks after his retirement, becoming an assistant coach for the 1987–88 season under head coach Bob Murdoch. The Murdoch-led Blackhawks finished with a record of 30–41–9 and lost in the division semi-finals against the St. Louis Blues four games to one.

Sutter got his first experience as a head coach with the International Hockey League (IHL) when he was hired to coach the Blackhawks&#x27; farm team Saginaw Hawks for the 1988–89 season finishing with a 46–26–10 record and a loss in the first round of the playoffs. For the following season, he joined the Indianapolis Ice where he led the team to a 53–21–8 record and the Turner Cup as IHL champions. For his efforts, Sutter was awarded the IHL Commissioners&#x27; Trophy for the coach of the year.

===Chicago Blackhawks===
Following the 1989–90 IHL season Sutter returned to the Chicago Blackhawks, this time under head coach Mike Keenan in the role of an associate coach. Sutter served in the associate coach role for the 1990–91 and 1991–92 NHL seasons including the four-game sweep loss during the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Following the loss in the Stanley Cup Finals there was significant interest in Sutter as a head coach for the Los Angeles Kings. In June 1992 Mike Keenan stepped down as head coach and signed a new contract to remain the general manager of the Blackhawks, Keenan then allowed Sutter to negotiate with the Kings. The Blackhawks&#x27; owner Bill Wirtz and senior vice president Bob Pulford intervened preventing the Kings from continuing to negotiate with Sutter and followed through on an earlier promise to hire Sutter as the Blackhawks head coach. Shortly afterwards Sutter signed a three-year contract to become the Blackhawks head coach. Only a few months later in November Mike Keenan left the Blackhawks organization, claiming later that he quit and was not fired.

In Sutter&#x27;s first season, he led Chicago to a first-place finish in the Norris Division—and the best record in the Campbell Conference—in 1992–93 with a 47–25–12 record (106 points), only to be swept in the opening playoff round by the St. Louis Blues, which featured his brother Rich on the team.

In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, he led Chicago to a 24–19–5 record and the Western Conference Finals falling to the Detroit Red Wings. Sutter&#x27;s contract was set to expire following the 1994–95 season and he was offered an extension before the start of the playoffs which he rejected. On June 20 Sutter announced he would step away from hockey and return home to the family farm in Viking, Alberta. The decision was largely made out of necessity for him to be with his son, Christopher, who has Down syndrome.

===San Jose Sharks===
After a two-year hiatus from coaching, Sutter returned to the NHL in 1997–98 season as head coach of the San Jose Sharks under general manager Dean Lombardi. The Sharks in the previous season finished with a dismal 27–47–8 record good enough for second last in the NHL. In his first season behind the bench, Sutter led the Sharks to a 34–38–10 record, which was eighth in the Western Conference and sixteenth in the NHL. The Sharks made their first playoff appearance in three seasons, losing in the first round to the Dallas Stars four games to two.

In the 1998–99 season Sutter improved on his previous regular season record finishing 31–33–18, which was seventh in the Western Conference and fifteenth in the NHL. Despite the two-point increase in the regular season record, the Sharks once again lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Colorado Avalanche four games to two.

In the 1999–2000 season Sutter improved on his previous regular season record for the third season in a row, finishing 35–30–10–7, which was eighth in the Western Conference and fifteenth in the NHL. The team was led by Owen Nolan, who tallied 44 goals, second in the NHL behind Pavel Bure. In the playoffs the Sharks defeated the St. Louis Blues in the first round in seven games, then fell to the Dallas Stars four games to one.

In the 2000–01 season Sutter further improved on his previous regular season record finishing 40–27–12–3, which was fifth in the Western Conference and eleventh in the NHL. In his debut season, goaltender Evgeni Nabokov won 32 games with the fourth-ranked goals against average at 2.19, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy. In the playoffs the Sharks fell to the St. Louis Blues four games to two in the first round.

In the 2001–02 season Sutter further improved on his previous regular season record finishing 44–27–8–3, which was good enough for 3rd in the Western Conference. In the playoffs the Sharks defeated the Phoenix Coyotes four games to one and were once again knocked out in the second round, this time to the Colorado Avalanche four games to three.

Sutter&#x27;s final season in San Jose came only months after agreeing to a new one-year contract from the Sharks. On December 1, 2002, Sutter along with assistant coaches Lorne Molleken and Rich Preston, was fired just 24 games into the 2002–03 season. At that point in the season Sutter had accumulated a record of 8–12–2–2, and would also be the first time in his professional career as a player or coach in which he failed to make the playoffs. His dismissal as head coach came weeks after earning his 300th career NHL coaching victory on November 16 in a 7–3 win against the Florida Panthers. Ron Wilson was hired by the Sharks four days later as head coach.

Darryl&#x27;s younger brother Ron played under him for three seasons in San Jose before heading to the Calgary Flames.

===Calgary Flames (first tenure)===
On December 28, 2002, four weeks after he was fired by San Jose, Sutter was named head coach of the Calgary Flames, replacing Greg Gilbert, who had been fired by Calgary on December 3. In April 2003, with Calgary already out of contention of a 2003 playoff spot and then-general manager Craig Button&#x27;s contract expiring, the Flames promoted Sutter to general manager along with his coaching responsibilities.

In the 2003–04 season, his first full season in Calgary, Sutter led the Flames to a 42–30–7–3 record and the organization&#x27;s first trip to the playoffs in seven seasons. As general manager, Sutter acquired San Jose goalie Mikka Kiprusoff for a second-round pick on November 16, 2003, after starting goaltender Roman Turek suffered an injury. Kiprusoff won 12 of 17 starts between November 20 and December 29, giving up one goal or fewer 11 times in that stretch. En route to the Stanley Cup Finals, where Calgary ultimately lost in seven games to the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Flames defeated three higher-ranked opponents in the Western Conference playoff bracket including the third seed Vancouver Canucks, the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winning Detroit Red Wings and second seed San Jose Sharks. Sutter and the Flames were unable to build upon their surprise success, however, as the entire following season, 2004–05, was cancelled due to a lockout.
In the 2005 off-season, Sutter selected his son Brett Sutter 179th overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, the same draft position Darryl was selected at in 1978. In 2010 Darryl traded his son Brett to the Carolina Hurricanes along with Ian White for Tom Kostopoulos and Anton Babchuk. The trade came one week after Brett was charged with assault following an incident at an Arizona bar.

Sutter&#x27;s final season as head coach of the Calgary Flames came in the 2005–06 season where he led the team to a 46–25–11 record finishing first in the Northwest Division. The team was propelled by strong performances by rookie defenseman Dion Phaneuf, captain Jarome Iginla, and Vezina Trophy winner Mikka Kiprusoff. However, the Flames were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs four games to three by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.

On July 12, 2006, Sutter stepped down as head coach of the Flames to focus on his role as general manager of the club. He has said that he found it difficult to handle the jobs of both head coach and general manager of the Flames. Sutter compiled a 107–73–15–15 record in parts of three seasons behind the Calgary bench. The Flames promoted Jim Playfair who served as assistant coach for the previous two and a half seasons as Sutter&#x27;s replacement, but after a first-round loss to Detroit in 2006–07 Sutter looked for a new head coach.

Before the 2007–08 season Sutter hired Mike Keenan as head coach, whom he coached under in Chicago at the beginning of his coaching career. Playfair remained with the Flames and accepted an associate coaching position. Sutter made a number of changes to the roster before the season, bringing in players with size and grit in Adrian Aucoin, Owen Nolan, Cory Sarich, Anders Eriksson and re-signing Wayne Primeau. The bigger and tougher Flames led by Mike Keenan finished the season 42–30–10, and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the San Jose Sharks four games to three.

Mike Keenan coached one more season behind the bench, improving to 46–30–6 in the 2008–09 season, but was then fired by Sutter a month after the Flames were eliminated from the playoffs by Chicago in the first round four games to two.

On June 23, 2009, Sutter hired his younger brother Brent Sutter as head coach to replace the recently fired Mike Keenan. Brent resigned as head coach of the New Jersey Devils on June 8, 2009, with one year left on his contract, and shortly afterward Darryl approached the Devils&#x27; general manager Lou Lamoriello for permission to speak to Brent for the coaching position. With the addition of Brent the Flames employed four of the Sutter brothers, with Duane the director of player personnel in 2008, and Ron the western pro scout.

On December 28, 2010, Sutter resigned as the general manager of the Calgary Flames by request of the club president Ken King, exactly eight years to the day Sutter joined the Flames. At the time the Flames had a record of 16–18–3 which was good enough for fourteenth in the Western Conference. Assistant general manager Jay Feaster was promoted to fill Sutter&#x27;s position as general manager.

===Los Angeles Kings===
On December 17, 2011, the Los Angeles Kings hired Sutter mid-season as the team&#x27;s new head coach after the dismissal of Terry Murray. It was the second time general manager Dean Lombardi hired Sutter, having previously hired Sutter to the San Jose Sharks in 1997, and firing him later in 2002. Sutter&#x27;s first game with the Kings was a December 22, 2011, shootout victory over the rival Anaheim Ducks. He led the Kings to a 25–13–11 mark in 49 games, finished third in the Pacific Division, and entered the 2012 playoffs as the eighth and last seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the team beat the first-seed Vancouver Canucks, second-seed St. Louis Blues, and third-seed Phoenix Coyotes to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, the only team to accomplish that feat in the 119-year history of the Finals. The Kings then went on to defeat New Jersey four games to two to give Los Angeles its first Stanley Cup championship in its 45-year history. The Kings set several records during the playoffs, including winning ten straight games on the road and being the first team to go three games to zero in each of their playoff series.

In the 2012–13 lock-out shortened season Sutter led the Kings to a record of 27–16–5 which was good enough for second in the Pacific Division. In the playoffs the Kings defeated the St. Louis Blues four games to two, and the San Jose Sharks four games to three until being defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks four games to one in the Western Conference finals.

In the 2013–14 season the Kings improved to 46–28–8 and finished third in the Pacific Division. The Kings started the playoffs against the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Quarterfinals, dropping the first three games, then winning the remaining four to become only the fourth team in NHL history to complete a reverse sweep. The Kings then went on to defeat the Anaheim Ducks four games to three, and the defending Stanley Cup champions Chicago Blackhawks four games to three to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. The Kings went on to defeat the New York Rangers four games to one to win their second Stanley Cup in three years. The 26 playoff games played by the Kings is the most for any Stanley Cup champion in NHL history.

Despite posting a 40–27–15 record in the 2014–15 season, Sutter and the Kings missed the 2015 playoffs by four points, becoming the first team since the 2006–07 Carolina Hurricanes to miss the playoffs entirely after winning the Stanley Cup the previous year, and only the fourth in NHL history.

In the 2015–16 season the Kings put up a record of 48–26–6 finishing second in the Pacific Division led by strong performances by Frank J. Selke Trophy and Lady Byng Memorial Trophy winner Anze Kopitar, and James Norris Memorial Trophy winner Drew Doughty. However, the playoffs resulted in a disappointing first-round loss to the San Jose Sharks four games to one.

The 2016–17 season was disappointing for Sutter as the Kings finished with a record of 39–35–8, missing the playoffs. On April 10, 2017, Anschutz Entertainment Group, owner of the Los Angeles Kings, relieved Sutter of his coaching duties as well as general manager Dean Lombardi after the Kings missed the playoffs for the second season in three years.

On June 20, 2018, Sutter announced his retirement from coaching and returned to his ranch in Viking, Alberta.

===Anaheim Ducks===
On July 2, 2019, the Anaheim Ducks named Sutter as an advisor to the coaching staff at the request of head coach Dallas Eakins. In the role Sutter reunited with former Blackhawks teammate and Ducks general manager Bob Murray.

===Calgary Flames (second tenure)===
On March 4, 2021, Sutter was re-hired mid-season as head coach of the Flames, after former coach Geoff Ward was fired the same day. Arriving at a time when the team was low in the standings, Sutter focused the remainder of the shortened 2020–21 season on laying the groundwork for new systems. The Flames did not qualify for the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs, finishing four points back of the Montreal Canadiens for the final playoff berth in the North Division.

The 2021–22 season would prove to be one of the most successful in the Flames organization&#x27;s history, with Sutter widely cited as a central reason for the improvements. On April 23, 2022, Sutter set a new personal best win record for a single season with the Flames&#x27; 6–3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks giving the team its 49th win. The Flames finished with a 50–21–11 record, first in the Pacific Division and sixth overall in the NHL. In recognition of his achievements, Sutter won the Jack Adams Award for best coach in the league for the first time. He was presented the award by his brother Brian, who had previously won the award in 1991 while coaching the St. Louis Blues. The postseason ended in disappointment, with the Flames being eliminated in the second round by the Edmonton Oilers.

On May 1, 2023, Sutter was fired by the Flames after a disappointing season that saw the team fail to make the playoffs by 2 points.

==Reputation==
===Playing style===
Darryl Sutter earned a reputation as a tough, hyper-competitive, and high work ethic NHL player who played at a high level despite the small size and absence of natural hockey ability, a reputation that applied to the six Sutter brothers. Sutter mastered a hardnose type of hockey to slow down faster and more skilled players while still providing scoring capability evidenced by his 40-goal first NHL season. Sutter&#x27;s hard nose and gritty style expected players to outwork their opponents and play &quot;old-fashioned playoff hockey&quot; throughout the season. The Sutter brothers owed their tough and competitive nature to childhood competitions and fights which were common around their childhood home. Describing himself and his brothers, Sutter has admitted,&quot;None of us has that much ability...we just relied on effort&quot;.

The combination of high work ethic and understanding of the game led the Chicago Blackhawks to name Sutter team Captain at the age of 24, only partway through his third full NHL season. In practices Sutter was known for his vocal leadership during practices, noticing and calling out teammates on sloppy play and errors.

Despite Sutter&#x27;s strong early seasons, his play began to decline as injuries accumulated. Sutter only played more than 60 games in two of his seven NHL seasons, owing to multiple injuries and surgeries for his ankle, knee, shoulder, ribs, and face after taking a deflected slapshot. Despite his injury history, Sutter claimed in an interview he often plays better when he is hurt as it makes him more upset or angry. Teammate Rick Paterson noted &quot;&quot;(Darryl) does more hurt than most guys do healthy&quot;, and coach Bob Pulford remarked &quot;players like him that always get hurt just because they play with so much intensity, but he wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. He&#x27;s a winner&quot;&quot;.

On the date of his retirement Sutter noted he was unable to keep up with the bigger and faster NHL and owing to his competitiveness stated &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be a hanger-on&quot;.

===Coaching and management style===
Former NHL coach and broadcaster Don Cherry in his 2014 book ranked Sutter as the 17th most successful NHL head coach. Cherry describes Sutter as an inspirational figure who is capable of motivating inferiorly skilled teams into overcoming more talented opponents. Sutter&#x27;s philosophy starts with strong goaltending, team defense, and two-way forwards. Sutter led several teams which relied on strong goaltending including the late-1990s San Jose Sharks behind Mike Vernon and Evgeni Nabokov, his acquisition of an untested Miikka Kiprusoff for the Calgary Flames who went on to help the Flames to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals and later win the Vezina Trophy and William M. Jennings Trophy. Finally, in Los Angeles, Conn Smythe Trophy-winning goalie Jonathan Quick helped the Kings with two Stanley Cups.

Sutter&#x27;s teams are built in the mold of his career as a player: physical, aggressive, willing to fight, and exhibiting a strong work ethic. Sutter demands these values from his players and has been willing to bench or trade players that do not meet his expectations. Sutter coached teams have an expectation to be tough and difficult to play against, which was most evident during the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs which saw physicality and fighting lead the Kings to the Stanley Cup. Sutter was described by former player and assistant coach Martin Gélinas as capable of pushing buttons, driving and motivating players.

Sutter&#x27;s coaching style has not come without criticism, former Los Angeles Kings player Justin Williams said Sutter was condescending to players and had a temper when games were not going well. Sutter&#x27;s exit from the Kings came three seasons after winning his second Stanley Cup in three years, with reports linking the reason to players being fed up with his coaching style and quitting on him, exemplified by public comments from defenseman Drew Doughty supporting a coaching change. As well, Sutter&#x27;s aggressive personality, serious demeanor, and near-permanent scowl (when combined with the fact that Sutter owns a cattle ranch in his personal life) have led to him being ironically nicknamed &quot;The Jolly Rancher.&quot;

As a general manager, Sutter had much more limited success. Across his eight drafts for the Calgary Flames between 2003 and 2010, Sutter made 59 draft picks, of which 33 never played an NHL game, nine played 10 or fewer NHL games, six played between 11 and 100 NHL games, and only four players appeared in more than 400 NHL games.

==Personal life==
Sutter was born on August 19, 1958, in Viking, Alberta approximately east of Edmonton, to Louis John Sutter (1930―2005) and Grace Sutter ( Sauers), both farmers. Darryl was the third of seven brothers and the second member of the Sutter family after his brother Brian to play in the NHL. Growing up the family did not have many luxuries, first living in a house with electricity and indoor plumbing in 1967 when Darryl was nine years old.

Sutter met his wife Wanda in a recreational softball league; they have three children, Brett, Jessie, and Christopher, who has Downs Syndrome. Sutter built a home neighbouring his parents on the family&#x27;s 3,000-acre farm outside of Viking where he raises cattle.

During his hiatus from coaching professional hockey in February 1997, Sutter fell from a height of 12 feet while doing repairs on the farm and suffered a skull fracture and a broken shoulder blade.

In 1996 the Sutter brothers established &quot;The Sutter Fund&quot; a non-profit group which raises money for family and child-centred organizations in Central Alberta.

<doc id="644688" wikidata="Q7726758" url="?curid=644688" title="The College Preparatory School">
<text>The College Preparatory School (CPS or College Prep) is a four-year private non-residential high school in Oakland, California. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Mens Conscia Recti&quot;, a Latin phrase adapted from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; that means &quot;a mind aware of what is right&quot;.

==History==
Founded in 1960, College Prep&#x27;s first campus was located in a house in the Claremont neighborhood of Oakland/Berkeley. The school was founded by Mary Harley Jenks, former head of the Bentley School, and Ruth Willis. Miss Jenks, the first Head of School, envisioned a school that valued &quot;high standards of scholarship and conduct.&quot; In 1983 College Prep moved to its current campus on Broadway.

College Prep has received accolades for its academic excellence. A 2007 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article ranked College Prep as the sixth best high school in the United States. In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked College Prep as the seventeenth best private school in the United States. In 2016, niche.com ranked College Prep the fourteenth best private school in the nation. For 2020, niche.com ranked College Prep the fourth best private school in the nation.

College Prep&#x27;s Heads of School have been Mary Harley Jenks (1960–1969), Robert Baldwin, Jr. (1969–1990), Clint Wilkins (1990–1994), Janet Schwartz (1994–1999), Murray Cohen (1999–2011), and Monique DeVane (2011–present). 

==Campus ==
At the current campus, a large central courtyard serves as the center of daily activity to create intimacy and a sense of community between students and faculty. Major projects have been the Scott MacPherson Stapleton World Languages and Cultures Building (created and dedicated in 2011), a new campus master plan (completed in 2014), and in 2020 the school began work on the Hill Project, a new array of buildings on the upper left of campus. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic they leased space at a nearby training center named Seneca and began to host some classes there.

As of January 2022, the Hill Project has been completed, and the Seneca campus lease has ended.

==Curriculum==

===English===

In the first two years of English at College Prep, students are sorted into classes that all read similar (or the same) books and have no specific focus. In a student&#x27;s Junior and Senior years, however, they are allowed to select seminars with specific focuses (for example Poetry or Harlem Renaissance).

In order to facilitate discussion, classes are conducted at Harkness tables: oval, wooden tables popularized by philanthropist Edward Harkness. Harkness believed that the tables encouraged students to actively participate in discussion, and that they constituted a &quot;revolution&quot; in liberal arts education.

===History===
The first three years of history have a preset focus. Freshmen take Asian Worlds, where they look at the history of India and China from its founding to the modern day. Sophomores take Atlantic World, which explores the development of the European and American history from the conclusion of the crusades through the end of the Enlightenment. Juniors take United States and the World to learn about the history of the United States as a nation, in part building off of the work the previous year in Atlantic Worlds. In their Senior year, students can elect to take seminars similar to those in English.

===Mathematics===
College Prep follows an integrated curriculum that combines numerous topics and strands of mathematics throughout the year. Despite the integrated format, each section does maintain a concentration on a core mathematical field; Math 1 (algebra), Math 2 (geometry), Math 3 (trigonometry), Math 4 (applied mathematics and analysis), Math 5 (AB &amp; BC calculus), and Math 6 (linear algebra). In addition, there are advanced classes for some levels: Math 3i, Math 4i, Math 5i. Math classes are assigned based on skill entering the school, and classes commonly span several grades. At the start of the year, freshmen take a placement exam, where they are placed into either Math I, Math II, or Math III (very rarely are they placed higher).

=== Science ===
College Prep&#x27;s science program establishes a foundation in scientific principles by requiring interdisciplinary study. While most public high schools teach introductory biology courses to freshmen, College Prep follows the Physics First model of teaching basic concepts of physics to Freshmen within an integrated laboratory format. After completing courses in chemistry (Sophomores) and biology (Juniors), students often elect to take other science electives (examples include Molecular Genetics, Developmental Biology, and Physical/Organic Chemistry). Elective classes are offered in most scientific disciplines.

===World languages===
College Prep offers four-year programs in Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and Latin. Depending on skill level, students are placed into level 1, 2, or 3 when they arrive, and after level 3 they are allowed to take seminars. Seminar levels of all world language classes are Advanced Placement preparatory. Students are required to take three years of one language or two years of two languages each.

College Prep&#x27;s Latin curriculum places emphasis on ancient Roman literature and history. All Latin students take the National Latin Exam annually.

=== Honors and AP ===
Students are not distinguished between enrollment in honors and standard courses, as all classes are taught at the honors level, and are designated as such by the University of California. Students&#x27; grade point averages are calculated on an unweighted 4.0 scale. Students are required to take three years of core curricular classes and an extra year of English. Many formal AP classes are not offered but students are given extracurricular preparation if they are interested.

===Arts===
College Prep students are required to fulfill the University of California Visual and Performing Arts education requirement by completing two semesters of arts classes within two disciplines. The Arts department therefore offers courses in visual arts, drama, music and dance.

The Visual Arts department teaches foundation- and advanced-level classes on creative and technical skills in drawing and design.

The drama program is centered around its Acting class and conducts two major drama productions each year, and is supported by stagecraft, drama tech, and digital video production classes.

Students in the music program often perform in instrumental ensembles (such as the jazz band or the orchestra), performing both standard and &quot;pop&quot; repertoire. The school also has a dedicated chorus and vocal ensemble. Many students participate in the non-audition Chorus class, but advanced singers can audition for an Advanced Vocal Ensemble. Members of the A.V.E. are regularly selected to perform in the prestigious National Honor Choir organized by the American Choral Directors Association.

Dance classes are offered at all levels, and students perform in high school dance festivals, senior centers, and in theaters throughout the Bay Area. The dance program focuses on modern dance with an emphasis on African American choreographers, and teaches the techniques of Lester Horton, José Limón, Martha Graham, Katherine Dunham, and Alvin Ailey. Guest choreographers regularly visit the school to teach students. Dance is highly popular at College Prep, and the program usually has around 70 dancers at one time.

==Student life==

=== Clubs ===
On-campus clubs usually meet weekly. Though each has a faculty advisor, they are mainly student facilitated. Clubs range from hobbies and interests (Gardening (DIRT) Club, Linguistics and Languages Club, Chess Club), to activism and social justice (Chinese Culture Club, Black Student Union, CPS Against Human Trafficking) to academia (Science Olympiad, Math Club, Latin Club, Only Connect Club, Gimkit Club, Quiz Bowl, Space and Rockets Club, Computer Science Team).

===Community service===
College Prep students participate in service efforts as a class, wherein Sophomores and Seniors are involved in maintenance projects at Point Reyes, and Juniors cooperate with Rebuilding Together to assist in various projects around the Bay Area. Seniors are required to complete a Senior Project in which they help out the greater Oakland community in some way. Students also do outside of school community service such as cooking for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s shelters in Oakland. School-wide participation in Oxfam and Amnesty International is common.

===The Radar===
The school has a student-run newspaper called The Radar. The Radar regularly publishes students&#x27; art and article submissions to its website and in its newsletters to the student body, which includes the regular &quot;Humans of CPS&quot; and &quot;Artist of The Week&quot; features. The Radar&#x27;s website is cpsradar.com

===Technology===
In an attempt to combine technology and student life, the school operates three full-service computer labs and four classrooms fully equipped with laptop computers. Each faculty member is provided a laptop and each incoming student is provided an Apple MacBook Pro laptop. The program is financed by a supplementary &quot;technology fee&quot; to the tuition. Families may opt out of the school-purchase plan if they purchase their own equipment. When students graduate, the computers belong to them.

CPS Campus is a student created app, supporting only with iOS and macOS and enables tracking of easily customized school schedules. The app is integrated with other programs such as the Clubs Calendar.

===Advising===
In their first year, students are put into a CAP (compass advising program) advisory group aimed at helping ease the transition to High School. Senior mentors in CAP help freshmen facilitate their transition into high school. After that, students are put in another advisory which they stay with for the remainder of their High School experience. The second advisory groups are aimed more at helping students with any troubles they might have than a rigorous curriculum.

College Prep also offers counseling and health education programs conducted by a full-time health educator and counselor, a trained child psychologist, who provides comprehensive support to students and conducts a mandatory health program for sophomores intended to introduce them to health topics and encourage them to make healthful choices.

===Retreats===
The school organizes a number of special retreats for each class. Freshman retreat is conducted at the Catholic Youth Organization&#x27;s campsite near Occidental, California, and is designed to help students adjust to high school. Sophomores retreat on the American River and participate in a whitewater rafting trip. Junior retreat is an exercise in leadership training and involves extensive group discussion and activities on an outdoor ropes course. Seniors discuss the transition from high school to college, providing an informal setting to say goodbye before graduation.

===Intraterm===
An Intraterm period takes place in the week before spring break, and consists of special courses (such as pottery or Dungeons &amp; Dragons), field studies (examples include trips to Seattle and Washington D.C.), and internships offered to students outside of the regular curriculum. Juniors may opt out of Intraterm classes or trips in order to visit colleges. Annual participation in Intraterm is a graduation requirement.

===College counseling===
College Prep has an intensive and individualized counseling process for college admissions – two counselors are staffed full-time, and students begin regularly meeting with their assigned counselor beginning in the middle of their Junior year. Individual meetings take place weekly, and students are required to attend periodic workshops regarding the admissions process.

===Diversity===
A Dean of Equity and Belonging facilitates discussion of diversity among faculty, staff, and students. A delegation of students attend the yearly conference for People of Color in Independent Schools and stage regular events such as forums, guest speakers, and classroom discussions. The mission of the Office of Equity and Belonging is to teach bias management, cultural competency, and servant leadership. Students also lead affinity spaces on campus, including the Asian American Association (AAA), Black Student Union (BSU), Feminist Union (FemU), Gender Sexuality Alliance (GSA), Jewish Student Union (JSU), Latinos Unidos, Muslim Student Association, South Asian Alliance (SAA), and Students with Interracial Lives (SWIRL). The Student Equity Action Team is a coalition of student leaders across affinity clubs that organizes events like Community, Purpose, and Service (CPS) Day. No Place for Hate Coalition and Showing Up for Racial Justice are student organizations that focus on training bias management, allyship, and facilitation skills.

== Speech and debate ==

=== Public Forum Debate ===
In the 2020–2021 season, College Prep&#x27;s public forum team earned seven bids to the national Tournament of Champions, a JV team came in second place at the Western Novice &amp; JV National Championship, and a team went undefeated in the qualification tournament for the National Speech and Debate Tournament. In addition, at the 2021 national Tournament of Champions, a team placed 8th in the country, making it to the quarterfinal round of Gold Public Forum.

=== Competitive Speech ===
College Prep&#x27;s speech team earned five bids to the national Tournament of Champions in the 2020-2021 season and sent several competitors to qualification tournaments for the Tournament of Champions, National Individual Events Tournament of Champions, Extemp Tournament of Champions, California State Championship, and National Speech and Debate Tournament. In the 2020-2021 season one competitor in Extemporaneous Speech qualified for all five championship tournaments including a double qualification to the National Speech and Debate Tournament. In past years several speech competitors made it to championship tournaments as well. In the 2021 season students placed in the semifinal round of the California State Championship, and quarterfinal rounds of national championships.

===Policy Debate===
College Prep has a competitive Policy Debate team, which has reached elimination rounds at numerous national tournaments, including winning the national Tournament of Champions in 2003 and reaching the final round of the National Speech and Debate Tournament in 2004 and 2012. In 2014, a novice CPS policy debate team won the Western Novice &amp; JV National Championship. Alumni of the College Prep debate program have gone on to win the prestigious Rex Copeland Award for the top-ranked college policy debate team in the country as well as reach late elimination rounds of the National Debate Tournament.

=== Lincoln-Douglas Debate ===
College Prep&#x27;s former Lincoln-Douglas debate team used to regularly compete at the Tournament of Champions, the National Speech and Debate Tournament, and the California State Championship. In 2008, a College Prep lincoln-douglas debater placed third in the California State Championship.

=== California Round Robin ===
College Prep hosts an annual round-robin policy debate tournament known as the &quot;California Round Robin&quot; every February, where top policy, Lincoln-Douglas, and public forum debate teams in the country are invited to participate. Rounds are held on the school campus and in conference rooms provided by the Oakland office of the Reed Smith law firm. The California Round Robin is unique from traditional tournaments in that the school invites experts on the year&#x27;s resolution to judge the final rounds. Because the final round is held the night before the popular California Invitational tournament at UC Berkeley, it is usually well attended by the invitational&#x27;s competitors.

=== Julia Burke Foundation ===
The debate team is supported by an endowment from the Julia Burke Foundation, and the foundation offers a scholarship to both the &quot;Debater of the Year&quot; at College Prep and the Julia Burke Flame for Excellence scholarship at the national policy debate Tournament of Champions.

==Athletics==
College Prep has a variety of interscholastic teams. Because of the school&#x27;s small size, and the school policy of exempting students from Physical Education classes during a semester of participation, the percentage of students who join sports teams is exceptionally high: 65% of Prep students play team sports. The school&#x27;s mascot is the Cougar, and the school colors are blue, maroon, and white.

College Prep is one of ten schools in the Bay Counties League – East. The school has won twenty-one League titles since 2010, namely:

* 7 NCS Championships
* 12 NCS Second Place Finishes
* 64 League Championships
* 5 League Sportsmanship Awards (by vote of the schools in the BCL East)
* Sent 90 student-athletes on to play at the collegiate level

As a separate component of the school&#x27;s modernization and expansion project, the Board also negotiated the unrestricted use of the Tom Bates Regional Sports Complex, an athletic compound adjacent to the Golden Gate Fields, for use by College Prep athletics.

==Tuition and endowment==
Tuition for the 2024–2025 school year was $57,600. In 2024–2025, 25 percent of the student body received need-based grants.

College Prep&#x27;s endowment is currently $19 million, or about $52,000 per student.

==Test scores==
The mean SAT Reasoning Test scores for the College Prep Class of 2024 were 746 (evidence-based reading and writing) and 747 (math; on scales of 200–800). The mean ACT (test) score for the College Prep Class of 2024 was 34. Of the Class of 2022, Class of 2023, and Class of 2024, 42% received National Merit Recognition, compared to approximately 5% of students nationwide. In 2019-20, 155 students took 349 Advanced Placement exams, with 82% of the scores being fours or fives.

<text>Mount Kerinci (Kerinci: &quot;Gunung Kincai&quot;, , ), also spelled Kerintji, is an active stratovolcano and the highest mountain in Sumatra, Indonesia. At above sea level, it provides Sumatra with the fifth-highest maximum elevation of any island in the world. It is surrounded by the lush forest of Kerinci Seblat National Park, home to several endangered species including the Sumatran tiger. Mount Kerinci is ranked 32nd by topographic isolation.

==Geography==
At above sea level, Kerinci is the highest volcano in Indonesia, and the highest of any situated on an island that is a part of Asia. Kerinci is located on the border of the titular Kerinci Regency of Jambi province and South Solok Regency of West Sumatra province, in the west-central part of the island near the west coast, and is about south of Padang.
It is part of the Barisan Mountains, a chain of volcanoes that span from the extreme northwest of the island (in Aceh province) to the extreme southeast (in Lampung province). It is the most prominent feature of the terrain of Kerinci Seblat National Park, with pine-forested slopes rising above the surrounding basin, and a cone wide and long at the base, elongated in the north-south direction. At the summit, there is a deep wide crater, often partially filled by a small crater lake on the northeast side of the crater floor.

==Volcanic activity==
Kerinci is more active than most Indonesian volcanoes, with nearly annual phreatic eruptions. In 2004, Kerinci erupted and continues to spew clouds of sulfurous smoke, with plumes reaching as high as above the summit. In 2009, Kerinci erupted again, followed by a June 2, 2013 eruption with spewed black smoke rising .

==Climbing==
Kerinci was first climbed in December 1877 by Dutch mountaineers Arend Ludolf van Hasselt and Daniël David Veth. It can be climbed from the village of Kersik Tuo, 6 or 7 hours away from Padang by car or bus. The climb and descent normally takes 2 days and 1 night, when choosing to go all the way to the summit. Climbers may also choose to go up only as far as Camp 2 or 3, skipping the summit attempt, which requires a pre-dawn climb. Kerinci&#x27;s terrain consists of thick jungle and can get muddy and slippery even if in only mild drizzles, which may occur occasionally even during the dry season. Anyone wishing to climb the volcano requires the services of a guide, under the Kerinci Seblat National Park regulations. There have been rare cases of people disappearing and/or dying from exposure or falls after attempting to trek alone.

==Lakes==
The Kerinci Seblat National Park has at least fifteen lakes of note, with the biggest being Kerinci Lake, followed by Gunung Tujuh Lake. The 4,200 hectares of Kerinci Lake lies at a height of , and is the host of the annual Kerinci Lake Festival. Gunung Tujuh Lake (literally, Seven Mountains Lake) is a caldera lake formed in an extinct volcano and is surrounded by seven peaks. It is also the highest lake in Southeast Asia at .

==Kecik Wok Gedang Wok==
Based on research in 1973, the &#x27;Kecik Wok Gedang Wok&#x27; people are recognized as the first tribe to settle at a plateau around Mount Kerinci 10,000 years ago. Today, the Kecik Wong Gedang Wok people are limited due to assimilation with the Proto-Malay tribes which came later. Around 135 dialects are used only along the valley. This makes ethnographic analysis difficult to conduct.

<text>Mataura is a town in the Southland region of the South Island of New Zealand. Mataura has a meat processing plant, and until 2000 it was the site of a large pulp and paper mill.

==Geography==
Mataura is situated on and the Main South Line railway, on the eastern fringe of the Southland Plain 13 kilometres south west of Gore and 53 kilometres north east of Invercargill. On the southern side of the town, diverges from SH 1 and runs westward through nearby communities such as Te Tipua and Waitane, ultimately terminating in Ohai. The town straddles the Mataura River which flows south through the town and is a source of brown trout. On the northern outskirts of the town the river falls over a bed of sandstone 6.1 metres (20 ft) high to create the Mataura Falls which is known by local Māori as Te Aunui (the great current).

The land rises to the Hokonui Hills 13 km to the north-west, while to the east is a series of hills.

==History and culture==

===Pre-European settlement===

While there was no permanent Māori settlement in the present day location of Mataura prior to the arrival of European settlers, the location was well known to local Maori for the harvest of lamprey (which they called &#x27;kana kana&#x27;) in October of each year as they made their annual passage up the falls. The closest Māori settlement was the kaika (unfortified village) of Tūtūrau, which was located near the east bank of the Mataura River downstream from the present town. In 1836 this village was the scene of the last act of Maori warfare in the South Island. A war party of approximately 70 members of the Ngāti Tama and Te Āti Awa tribes under the command of Te Pūoho-o-te-rangi, chief of the Ngāti Tama tribe and an ally and distant relative of Te Rauparaha attacked and occupied the village which was later retaken by the local Ngāi Tahu under the leadership of Hone Tūhawaiki (paramount chief of the Ngāi Tahu) and Te Matenga Taiaroa who had been at the Bluff when news of the war party&#x27;s presence in the Southland came.

===European settlement===
In 1854 the Murihiku block of land (which included Mataura) was purchased from local Maori by the Otago Provincial Council, with the objective of developing it up for settlement by immigrants from Great Britain.
At the time, travellers between Southland and Otago were drawn to the Mataura area by the presence of the Tuturau ford located about 3.2 km downstream of the falls and the northern ford which was located approximately above the falls.
By 1856 the Otago Provincial Council had recognised that if development was to succeed a ferry had to be established at the falls to enable a direct overland transport between Dunedin and Invercargill. At the time the only alternative route was going by sea along the dangerous southern coast.

In 1859 the Otago Provincial Government built a wooden truss bridge which rested on a large rock in the middle of the falls and was suitable only for foot traffic with large animals and vehicles restricted to crossing on the ferry. As the bridge was always wet and slippery with spray from the falls, the face of the falls was removed by dynamite which moved the falls upstream. This work which damaged the look of the falls was in vain as the bridge was totally destroyed by a major flood on 22 April 1861. To encourage use of the bridge the council also built the Mataura Ferry Hotel on the west bank of the river. This was leased to John MacGibbon who with his family were the first inhabitants of the settlement and as part of his 7-year lease had the right to charge a toll on anyone crossing the river within a mile below and above the falls. At the time the only other Europeans living in the area were John Turnbull who owned the Tuturau Run and the Shanks family who owned the Marairua Run.
The loss of the bridge meant that travellers reverted to using the ferry which had been established north of the falls.
In 1866 James Pollack won the tender for the lease of the Mataura Ferry Hotel and offered to build a replacement bridge in return for the right to charge tolls for 12 years. His offer was declined by the Otago Provincial Government who built a replacement bridge of the suspension type, which was opened on 27 August 1868. Crossing the gorge downstream of the falls it was a more substantial timber structure with 16 supporting cables passing over stone pillars before being anchored in rock. A footbridge was added in 1898.

In response to the commencement on construction on the new bridge James Pollack built the Bridge Hotel on the east bank of the river by the bridge and sold the Mataura Ferry Hotel. He also petitioned the government to undertake the first survey of the location which subsequently named the area the Town of Mataura Bridge.

As a major mail coach stop on the route from Dunedin to Invercargill the bridge soon attracted a number of businessman who set up premises on the east bank around an area called Bridge Square. The construction of the telegraph line between Dunedin and Invercargill which passed through the town lead to the establishment in December 1868 of the first post and telegraph office in the Mataura Valley. This consolidated the settlement&#x27;s position as a major transportation and communications hub. This in turn led to it attracting more businessmen, and becoming a major service centre. As a result of this growth a school was established in 1870. The moving of the former Mataura Ferry Hotel (by now renamed Cameron&#x27;s Hotel) downstream to a location on the west bank where it was better able to service the passing traffic initiated development on the west bank which was assisted by the surveying of the west and north Mataura in 1874.

In 1875 a railway line was built from Gore to Mataura which in conjunction with establishment of the Mataura Paper Mill helped the town evolve and develop into the major industrial centre in Eastern Southland. The 1921 railway station has been listed NZHPT Category II since 1996. It is a standard class B station, of weatherboard and slate. In 2021 a feasibility study was started to consider moving the building to a new site.

===Replacement of the bridge===

By the 1930s the narrowness of the bridge which restricted travel to one direction at a time and its light construction had become inadequate for the increasing traffic and heavy loads. As a result, a new bridge was constructed by the Ministry of Works immediately upstream of the suspension bridge (which was subsequently demolished) and opened in July 1939 by Bob Semple, the Minister of Works. It was a single span bow-arch reinforced concrete 53.8 metres (176 ft 6 inches) in length.

=== Toxic waste ===
Aluminium dross from the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter was stored at the paper mill in Matuara from 2015 until 2021. It was moved into the disused paper mill without resource consent by a now defunct company. The 8000 tonnes of aluminium dross, also known as ouvea premix, if mixed with water would have released clouds of ammonia gas. The paper mill site could potentially be flooded by the Mataura river. There were concerns in August 2020 when firefighters had to put out a fire that came within 30 metres of the ouvea premix. The New Zealand government and New Zealand Aluminium Smelters shared the cost of removing this toxic waste, which was completed by July 2021.

===Marae===

Mataura Marae began being built in Mataura in the 1980s. Work resumed in 2017, including converting an old dairy factory into a &quot;wharekai&quot; (dining hall). The carvings on the &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house) were carried out by Te Puia in Rotorua.

In October 2020, the Government committed $294,009 from the Provincial Growth Fund towards funding the marae development trust, creating 17 jobs.

==Demographics==
Mataura covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Mataura had a population of 1,629 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 120 people (8.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 69 people (4.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 660 households, comprising 813 males and 816 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.0 males per female. The median age was 39.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 348 people (21.4%) aged under 15 years, 300 (18.4%) aged 15 to 29, 723 (44.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 258 (15.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 75.5% European/Pākehā, 31.5% Māori, 2.8% Pasifika, 2.2% Asian, and 1.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 6.1, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.4% had no religion, 32.4% were Christian, 2.0% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.7% were Muslim and 1.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 51 (4.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 465 (36.3%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,600, compared with $31,800 nationally. 81 people (6.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 648 (50.6%) people were employed full-time, 159 (12.4%) were part-time, and 54 (4.2%) were unemployed.

==Local government==

Prior to 1882 local government had been undertaken first by the Tutarau Wardens and then by the Tutarau Road Board. On 29 March 1892 a newly established Town Board took over local government administration of the town&#x27;s affairs and representation of the town&#x27;s 70 ratepayers.
The town&#x27;s affairs remained under the administration of the Town Board until 1895 when it changed to the Mataura Borough Council. In 1989 the Mataura Borough Council was merged into the Gore District Council.

===Mayors===
*Thomas Culling – 1895 to 1897. Prior to becoming the borough&#x27;s first mayor he had been chairman of the town board.
*Hugh Cameron
*Thomas MacGibbon
*John Lowden – 1903 to 1906
*John Galt – 1906 to 1909
*Andrew Balneaves – 1909 to 1912
*Forrest William Brown – 1915 to 1917
*Charles Donohue McConnell – 1919 to 1935, 1938 to 1950
*John Buchanan – 1935 to 1938
*James William Ingram – 1950 to 1959
*Malcolm Tulloch – 1959 to 1962
*S.I.L (Logie) McKelvie – 1962 to 1970
*Keith Raymond Henderson – 1970 to 1982
*Ian Tulloch – 1982 to 1989. The last mayor of the town before it became part of the Gore District Council

==Education==

Mataura School serves years 1 to 6 with a roll of as of It opened in 1878.

Children of intermediate and secondary school age are bussed to Gore to continue their education there.

==Facilities==
The town&#x27;s swimming pool opened in 1956 and closed in 2017.

==Electricity supply==
Because it had surplus generation capacity the freezing works had since 1905 been supplying electricity to the nearby town of Gore, while due to the town&#x27;s financial situation Mataura residents were still using candles and kerosene powered lamps. It wasn&#x27;t until 1911 the Borough Council was able to reach agreement with the freezing works for them to increase their generating capacity so that they could supply the Mataura load. After taking out a loan to finance the expansion of the generation capacity and the installation of a distribution system around the town the first power began being supplied from 5 October 1912.
Mataura retained its own independent power system until 1932 when due to technical issues it became impossible for the freezing works to continue supplying the town. As a result, the borough council accepted an offer to sell their power system to the Southland Electric Power Board, which took over responsibility for supplying the town from its distribution network.

==Industry==

===Mataura Dairy Factory===
In January 1887 a company was formed to construct and operate a dairy factory. After procuring land a factory was constructed and up and running by November of that year. Water for use in the milk and cheese making processes was obtained from a private spring while power was provide by a steam engine powered by local lignite. It was not until 1917 that the factory converted to electric power from the local distribution network. By the early 1970s the company was in financial trouble and closed in May 1980, when dairy processing in the area was concentrated at the Edendale Dairy Factory.

===Mataura Paper Mill===
In the mid-1870s a company led by James Bain was formed in Invercargill to establish a pulp and paper mill on the east bank of the river downstream of the Mataura falls. To assist them the Government granted the company freehold of land on both sides of the river at the falls, as well as all water rights, which would allow the head to be utilised to provide cheap power to the paper making machinery. The company however installed obsolete second hand machinery, which lead to the mill being unprofitable. 

In 1884 it was sold to the partners of Dunedin-based Coulls Culling and Co. and Thomas S. Culling, who was senior partner in the Dunedin-based business of R. Wilson and Co. Under the direction of Thomas Culling, the company had by 1888 installed new paper making machinery as well as two hydro generators one of 50 Hp and the other of 250 hp. In 1891 the paper mill and the freezing works jointly built a weir to a race to improve the water supply to their respective hydro generators. In 1892 the mills became profitable, and by 1895 the paper mill was employing 54 staff. Thomas Culling eventually purchased the interests of four of the partners leaving him owner in partnership with J. L. Gregory. In late 1904 as a means of ending an unprofitable price war between Mataura Falls Paper Mill, Otago Paper Mills at Woodhaugh near Dunedin and Riverhead Paper Mills at Auckland these companies amalgamated into a new company called the New Zealand Paper Mills. 

By 1905 the mill had three bag-making machines, and two machines for printing the bags. In 1913 the mill was badly damaged by a major flood, which took a month to repair. In 1923 a second paper making machine designated No.3 was transferred from the Riverhead mill (which was subsequently closed) to join the No.2 machine, which up till then had been the only machine at the mill. At the same time a new machine designated the No.4 was installed.

In 1936 a new paper making machine designated the No.5 machine was installed.

In 1960 Fletchers Ltd bought an interest in the company. As a result of their injection of new capital the mill was completely modernised. In 1964 NZ Forest Products took a 30% share in the company with Fletchers having 30%. On 8 July 1970 NZ Forest Products took complete ownership of New Zealand Paper Mills.
In 1976 the mill celebrated its centennial year.

By 1990 the mill, owned by NZ Forest Products, had become a division of Elder Resources, until it was taken over by Carter Holt Harvey in 1991. Between 1984 and 1991, due to upgrades and efficiency gains, productively had increased by 25% with 216 staff employed at the end of the period. Employees had increased by 1993 to 230 people, of which twenty were women. A four shift system was being used, which operated every day except for two days during the Christmas holiday period. The shifts were eight hour long with shift workers working six days on and two days off.
By 1997 the mill was producing approximately 25,000 tonnes of paper products per year. 
The mill&#x27;s equipment was powered by a combination of onsite hydro power, steam boilers powered by local coal and supply from the local grid.

By the late 20th century the mill was coming under intense pressure from Asian competitors which had depressed the world price for paper, and as a result the mill was losing NZ$1 million a year. Faced with these losses and forecasts that they would continue, and with the mill contributing only 3% of Carter Harvey Holt output by volume, the company closed the mill on 18 August 2000 with 155 staff being made redundant.

===Mataura Flour Mill===
As a result of concerns expressed by local citizens about the proposed new paper mill&#x27;s proposal to secure sole rights to harnessing all the electrical potential of the falls, the paper mill&#x27;s proprietors obtained the goodwill of the citizens by building a flour mill on the west bank. The three grinding stones in the mill were driven by a water wheel.
The flour mill was demolished in 1893 to make room for the freezing works.

===Mataura Freezing Works===
The Southland Frozen Meat And Produce Export Company (which had been established in 1882) purchased land on the west bank of the river from Thomas Culling (the principal of the Mataura Paper Mills) upon which they built and opened the second freezing (meat processing) works in Southland. At the time eastern Southland sheep farmers tended to send their livestock by rail to Dunedin for slaughtering and it was intended that the new works would compete for their business.

The plant opened on 21 April 1893, with freezing starting 4 days later. The complex&#x27;s machinery was powered by electricity from a hydro generator powered by water diverted from the falls. A steam engine provided backup power. 

By early May production had increased to 300 carcasses a day. The complex at the time of its opening featured 3 freezing chambers, each capable of holding 600 carcasses. The storerooms could accommodate 16,000 carcasses, which by 1897 had been increased to 24,000 carcasses.
By 1905 40 to 50 people were being employed at the works. 

In 1931 a new slaughter board was installed in the complex.

In the 1947 to 1948 season the slaughterhouse changed over from solo butchering to the chain system of slaughtering livestock. Whereas previously one man took responsibility for butchering an animal from start to finish, with the chain system one man was limited to undertaking one task. Compared with the previous system where the workers were permanent residents of the town the chain system lead to increasing numbers of seasonal workers who lived in the town only during the killing season.

In 1982 a methane plant was installed which allowed the complex to supply more of its power demand.

After a series of takeovers the Mataura works came under the ownership of Alliance Group Limited in 1989. The works currently undertakes the processing of lamb, sheep, cattle and bobby calves. 

Due to intensive development and expansion throughout its history, the plant extends for some distance along the bank of the river, sandwiched between it and State .

===Fibreboard manufacturing===
In 1997 Rayonier NZ limited opened on a greenfield site a medium-density fibreboard (MDF) manufacturing plant at Brydone, 8 kilometres south of Mataura. The facility was subsequently purchased by Dongwha in 2005. Renamed as the Patinna mill it specializes in thin and high density fibreboard products with 90% of its output exported. The mill was acquired by Japanese company Daiken in 2018.

<text>Peter Philip Laviolette Jr. (born December 7, 1964) is an American professional ice hockey coach and former player who is the head coach for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Originally undrafted by teams in the NHL, he played a total of 12 games with the Rangers in the 1988–89 season. Following retirement from active play, Laviolette also served as head coach of the New York Islanders, Carolina Hurricanes, Philadelphia Flyers, Nashville Predators, and Washington Capitals. He led the Hurricanes to a Stanley Cup win in 2006, and later coached the Flyers to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2010, as well as the Predators in 2017. Laviolette is the fourth coach in NHL history to lead three teams to the Stanley Cup Finals.

On October 13, 2021, Laviolette won his 647th game as an NHL head coach, passing John Tortorella to become the winningest American-born head coach in league history. In February 2022, Laviolette became the 10th head coach in NHL history to record 700 wins, and in March 2024 he became the eighth coach to record 800 wins.

Laviolette was born in Franklin, Massachusetts, and attended Franklin High School, where he played baseball and ice hockey. He played college ice hockey at Westfield State College in Westfield, Massachusetts.

==Playing career==
As a player, Laviolette spent the majority of his 10-year career playing for various minor league teams. He played 12 games in the NHL for the New York Rangers during the 1988–89 season, but failed to record a point. Laviolette also played for the United States in the Olympics twice (1988 and 1994).

==Coaching career==

He began his coaching career as head coach of the ECHL&#x27;s Wheeling Nailers. In one season as coach, he led his team to a 37–24–9 record and a berth in the playoffs, wherein they lost in the third round. He left Wheeling to take over the head coaching job for the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL). In 1998–99, he coached the team to a 56–15–4 regular-season record. In the playoffs, Providence won the AHL Calder Cup Championship with a 15–4 playoff record. Laviolette was named the AHL Coach of the Year.

Laviolette&#x27;s success in the AHL earned him a stint as an assistant coach for the Boston Bruins. Having grown up in the Boston suburb of Franklin, Laviolette was disappointed when he did not get the head coaching job in Boston after that season so he left for the head coaching job on Long Island.

===New York Islanders===
He became head coach of the New York Islanders in 2001. After taking over the New York Islanders, which had missed the playoffs for seven years before his arrival, he led his team to the playoffs in both seasons he was there. His first season in New York, the Islanders earned 96 points (42–28–8–4 record), nearly winning the Atlantic Division before losing in the first round to the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games. The Islanders snuck into the playoffs the following season and then lost in five games to the Ottawa Senators in the first round. On June 3, 2003, he was fired by general manager Mike Milbury.

===Carolina Hurricanes===
Laviolette came to the Carolina Hurricanes as head coach in the 2003–04 season, taking over following the firing of Paul Maurice. In his first season, he coached 52 games during a rebuilding year. Laviolette led the Hurricanes to an excellent regular season during his second year at the helm, winning the Southeast Division with 112 points (52–22–8 record). He also coached the U.S. Olympic men&#x27;s hockey team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The Hurricanes won their first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history during the 2006 playoffs, after winning two very close seven-game playoff series over the Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers. Laviolette was the fourth American-born coach to win it. He was also the runner-up for the Jack Adams Award for the NHL&#x27;s Coach of the Year, which was awarded to Lindy Ruff in the closest vote ever recorded for this award, 155–154.

After winning their first Stanley Cup, Laviolette&#x27;s Hurricanes suffered through an injury-plagued 2006–07 season that saw the team finish with a disappointing 40–34–8 record. The next season, the team once again got off to a poor start, but held first place in a weak division for most of the season, despite having a sub-.500 record until February. The team then got hot and built what was seen as a solid lead. However, the Washington Capitals got red hot in the final weeks, Carolina lost several games down the stretch, and Laviolette&#x27;s group missed the post-season.

On November 7, 2008, following his 240th victory, Laviolette moved past John Tortorella to become the winningest American-born coach in the NHL. Tortorella later eclipsed this record in 2009, and after several years of being within a few wins of each other, Laviolette regained the lead in 2021 while coaching the Washington Capitals.

On December 3, 2008, Laviolette was fired as coach of the Hurricanes and replaced by his predecessor, Paul Maurice.

Laviolette worked on the panel for the TV network TSN.

===Philadelphia Flyers===
On December 4, 2009, Laviolette replaced John Stevens as the head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers. Barely making it into the playoffs thanks to a shootout victory over rival New York Rangers, Laviolette&#x27;s Flyers became the third NHL team to come back from a 3–0 series deficit, defeating the Boston Bruins 4–3 in Game 7 to reach the 2010 Eastern Conference Finals. On May 24, 2010, Laviolette led the Flyers to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks. The Flyers would lose the Finals in six games, with Chicago winning the Cup in overtime on June 9.

On April 1, 2012, in a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Laviolette jawed with the Penguins&#x27; head coach Dan Bylsma after Penguin Joe Vitale hit Flyer Daniel Brière late in the game. Laviolette swung a stick against the boards which broke in half, and continued to verbally go after Bylsma and assistant coach Tony Granato, an American teammate of Laviolette during the 1988 Winter Olympics.

The HBO series &quot;24/7: Flyers/Rangers&quot; leading up to the 2012 Winter Classic gave fans rare access to the Flyers locker room, and many of Laviolette&#x27;s quotes became popular catch-phrases, such as, &quot;We need to start playing with some jam,&quot; and, &quot;It&#x27;s about as casual as it gets.&quot; Laviolette himself acknowledged the popularity of his &quot;jam&quot; catch-phrase by making a video for the Flyers 2012 Fan Appreciation Game thanking Philadelphia fans for &quot;bringing more jam than any other city in sports.&quot; For the Flyers&#x27; Game 6 Eastern Conference Quarter-final game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Flyers gave away orange shirts to all fans attending featuring an angry likeness of Laviolette and the phrase, &quot;Time for some JAM!!&quot;

After a 0–3 start of the 2013–14 season by the Flyers, Laviolette was fired on October 7, 2013. He was replaced by assistant coach Craig Berube.

===Nashville Predators===
On May 6, 2014, Laviolette was hired to become the head coach of the Nashville Predators, becoming the second head coach in the team&#x27;s history. He replaced Barry Trotz, who served 15 years as head coach of the Predators and the only coach the franchise had seen. Laviolette and his Nashville staff were chosen to coach one of the teams in the 2015 NHL All-Star Game for having the highest points percentage in the NHL through January 8, 2015. Laviolette guided the Predators to a franchise record ninth consecutive home win with a 4–3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on February 4, 2015. During the 2015-16 season, Laviolette guided the Predators to a new franchise record 14-game point streak. The team qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs but lost to the San Jose Sharks in the second round.

In 2017, the Predators again qualified for the playoffs as the second wild card spot with 94 points. In the first round, the team swept the Chicago Blackhawks 4–0, marking the first time that an eighth seed swept a playoff series against the top seed in the conference in National Hockey League history. In the second round, the Predators defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games, marking the first time the team advanced to the Western Conference Finals. On May 16, the Predators beat the Anaheim Ducks in game 3 of the Western Conference Finals and became the first team in 20 years (since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997) to achieve 10 straight wins at home in the postseason. On May 22, 2017, Laviolette guided the Predators to the franchise&#x27;s first Western Conference Championship by beating the Ducks 6–3 to move on to the Stanley Cup Finals. After going down to the Pittsburgh Penguins 2–0, the Predators evened the series at 2, winning games 3 and 4 at home. Returning to Pittsburgh, the Predators lost 6–0 before being eliminated at home 2–0 in game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals on June 11, 2017.

Laviolette was fired by the Predators on January 6, 2020, with the team sitting in sixth place in the division at the time with a record of 19–15–7.

===Washington Capitals===
On September 15, 2020, Laviolette was named head coach of the Washington Capitals, replacing the recently fired Todd Reirden.

On April 14, 2023, Laviolette and the Capitals mutually agreed to part ways after the team missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2013–14 season and finished with a below-.500 win percentage.

===New York Rangers===
On June 13, 2023, the New York Rangers hired Laviolette as head coach, replacing Gerard Gallant. In his first year, Laviolette led the Rangers to a 55–23–4 record, winning the Presidents&#x27; Trophy, also becoming the first head coach in NHL history to guide six different teams to the Stanley Cup playoffs.

===International===
On February 26, 2020, Laviolette was named head coach of the United States men&#x27;s national team.

==Personal life==
Laviolette and his wife Kristen have two sons and one daughter. Laviolette&#x27;s oldest son, Peter Laviolette III, plays for the ECHL&#x27;s Wheeling Nailers, with whom Laviolette began his coaching career during which Laviolette III was born.

<text>Günther Johannes Jauch (; born 13 July 1956) is a German television presenter, television producer, and journalist, best known as the longtime host of &quot;Wer wird Millionär?&quot;, the German version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;

== Career ==
Jauch is known for a unique style of informing and entertaining people that is generally considered witty and funny. He won several awards for his appearances in German television. Jauch also owns the production company &quot;i&amp;u TV&quot;, which stands for &quot;Information und Unterhaltung&quot; (&quot;information and entertainment&quot;). He is known to make large donations to charity from money he receives from his appearances in advertisements and other promotional work.

Jauch has used his personal wealth to purchase and restore several historic buildings in and around Potsdam, his current town of residence.

In the 1980s, Jauch worked for radio programs of Bayerischer Rundfunk. Jauch has produced and hosted the prime time TV programme &#x27;, a television news magazine programme, on the private German RTL national TV network since 1990. The programme caused some sensation due to the transmission of falsified articles delivered by the journalist Michael Born who was subsequently convicted to a four-year prison sentence in 1996, a few other prominent German TV networks had also been deceived with such material. In January 2011, after celebrating the end of his 21-year reign hosting &#x27;, Jauch will now host a weekly political talkshow on the national German public TV network Das Erste (&quot;The First&quot;).

In 2005, Jauch was named by &quot;Stern&quot; magazine the most famous German in the world. In late 2006, Jauch announced that he would only host the first broadcast of the Four Hills Tournament (from Oberstdorf) and celebrate New Year&#x27;s Eve with his family. Jauch had hosted all events of the Four Hills Tournament since 2000. The 2007 season tournaments from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Innsbruck and Bischofshofen were hosted by Marco Schreyl instead.

Jauch, together with Thomas Gottschalk, is also part of the German TV show &quot;Die 2 – Gottschalk und Jauch gegen alle&quot;.

In 2015, shortly after Stefan Raab announced the end of his TV career, Jauch declared publicly that he intended to gradually reduce his TV appearances; stating that he will eventually give up his political talk show &quot;Günther Jauch&quot; on ARD and to focus on his other TV shows such as &quot;Wer wird Millionär?&quot; on RTL.

==Personal life==
After 18 years of common-law marriage, Jauch married Thea in the Orangerie at Schloss Sanssouci in Potsdam in 2006. He is a member of the Hamburg Jauch family.

Jauch and Thea have two biological daughters, Svenja (born in 1989) and Kristin (born in 1993). The couple adopted two orphaned daughters in 1997 and 2000, named Katja and Masha.

===Philanthropy===

Jauch is characterised by his secluded lifestyle. He stated in interviews that he takes the liberty of leading a life that does not correspond to his supposed economic possibilities. According to his own statement, he has spent considerable amounts of his income, including all the profit from advertising jobs, on charitable causes since the early years of his career. In 2002, he made significant financial contributions to the reconstruction of the Fortunaportal (Gate of the Fortuna) at the Potsdam Stadtschloss city palace. Jauch has also given financial support to other projects in Potsdam, e.g. the Belvedere on the Pfingstberg, (where he got married in 2006), the Potsdam city canal, the Kloebersaal, a hall in the north wing of the Marmorpalais (Marble Palace), which is opposite his villa at Heiligen See lake, as well as the restoration of the Neptungrotte (Neptune Grotto) in the palace gardens of Schloss Sanssouci. Furthermore, he supported the construction of the Marienschule Potsdam, a co-educational Roman-Catholic school for primary and secondary education, which belongs to the archdiocese of Berlin. The prime minister of Brandenburg, Matthias Platzeck, called him a citizen every mayor could ever wish for. Jauch was an ambassador for the Berlin Pro-Reli-Kampagne, a petition which aimed to change the Education Act of the state of Berlin in order to introduce religious studies as an elective subject instead of ethics as a sole compulsory subject. The campaign eventually failed in April 2009.

Jauch&#x27;s ancestress on his grandmother&#x27;s side, Anna Weißebach, founded the Caritas Konferenzen, the German branch of the International Association of Charities. Jauch&#x27;s own family set up soup kitchens in Hamburg as early as the 19th and 20th century and founded and maintained poorhouses in Hamburg and other places. In line with his family&#x27;s tradition of charitable foundations, Jauch endowed the founding of a branch of Die Arche in Drewitz (Potsdam) in 2009, which provides free meals for children in need. He also covers ongoing property and personnel expenses. Die Arche – Christliches Kinder- und Jugendwerk e.V. is a Christian organisation for children and adolescents.

===Vineyard owner===
Jauch also continues a 200-year-old family tradition of wine-growing. In 2010, he successfully applied for membership in the German Prädikat Wine Estates VDP (German: &quot;Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter&quot;), in order to acquire a relative&#x27;s vineyard (Othegraven in Kanzem) which was approved by VDP that certifies Germany&#x27;s wines that meet the organizations requirements. The entire property, including a mansion and an English Garden, has been subject to preservation orders since 2003.

Jauch&#x27;s family has been running the winery since 1805, when his ancestor and merchant Emmerich Grach bought the property. Jauch&#x27;s grandmother Elsa von Othegraven, his grandfather Hans Jauch and his father Ernst-Alfred Jauch were part of the community of heirs. However, in 1996 the winery was inherited by a distant relative.

In order to ensure that the winery was not going to be sold to a party outside the family, Jauch decided to buy it. One of the previous owners had been Jauch&#x27;s famous great-great-uncle, Franz Weißebach. According to the VDP, the vineyard is a gem of a vineyard, rare in its quality and attractive location. In 2011, Jauch acquired a further vineyard (Wawerner Herrenberg) in Wawern that is 3.5 acres. It had also belonged to his ancestor Emmerich Grach. Jauch also co-produced wines that supermarket chain Aldi has been selling under his name since 2018.

===Dispute about privacy===
Jauch wanted to legally prohibit any type of media coverage in the preparation of his wedding in July 2006. The Landgericht Berlin granted him an interim injunction against the newspaper Bild and other publications of the Springer publishing house. The Kammergericht Berlin, however, decided against a prohibition of general media coverage in June 2006 due to his celebrity status. According to the judges, they were allowed to report about the date and place of the wedding. After the magazine Bunte published photos of the wedding and details about the ceremony, Thea Jauch went to court against the publishing house to demand damages and compensation for pain and suffering totalling 325,000 Euros. The Landgericht Hamburg awarded her only 25,000 Euros compensation in January 2008. The judgment was set aside by the Hanseatisches Oberlandesgericht in October 2008. As a public figure, interest in Jauch&#x27;s wedding was legitimate, it said. An anew appeal was refused by the Federal Constitutional Court. The demand for damages by Jauch in a separate lawsuit was in vain as well.

The couple then went before the European Court of Human Rights to claim that the German justice system did not protect Jauch&#x27;s right to privacy sufficiently and breached his right to protection of property, because they did not award him damages for the published photos. The court in Strasbourg affirmed the public&#x27;s interest in his wedding and therefore, their claims were without cause. German justice had carefully weighed between the right to privacy and the freedom of the press, it said. The complaint was declared inadmissible.

<text>Manuel Eduardo Sarmiento Aponte (born February 2, 1956) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher who played with the Cincinnati Reds (1976–79), Seattle Mariners (1980) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1982–83) in Major League Baseball.

Sarmiento played for four years with Cincinnati&#x27;s &quot;Big Red Machine&quot;. While with the Reds, he posted a 14–8 record with 138 strikeouts, six saves, and a 4.12 ERA in 132 appearances (including five as a starting pitcher).

For part of 1982, he switched from the bullpen in an emergency move and had a 9–4 record with 81 strikeouts and 3.39 ERA record before returning to relief duties in the 1983 season.

== Quote==
&quot;Sarmiento was a fine fielder with a lively split-finger fastball and a singing voice good enough to once sing the National Anthem before a game. As a 20-year-old rookie in 1976, the slender Venezuelan helped the Reds to a World Championship with five relief wins&quot;. - Ed Walton, at &quot;Baseball Library&quot;.

<text>The Bukit Barisan or the Barisan Mountains are a mountain range on the western side of Sumatra, Indonesia, covering nearly 1,700 km (1,050 mi) from the north to the south of the island. The Bukit Barisan range consists primarily of volcanoes shrouded in dense jungle cover, including Sumatran tropical pine forests on the higher slopes. The highest peak of the range is Mount Kerinci at 3,800 metres (12,467 ft). The Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park is situated towards the southern end of the range in Liwa, Indonesia.

The name Bukit Barisan actually means &quot;row of hills&quot; or &quot;hills that make a row&quot; in Malay, for the range stretches end to end along the island of Sumatra.

There are 35 active volcanoes in Bukit Barisan. The largest is the supervolcano Toba within the 100 km (62 miles) × 30 km (19 miles) Lake Toba, which was created after a caldera collapse (est. in 74,000 Before Present). The eruption is estimated to have been at level eight on the VEI scale, the largest possible for a volcanic eruption.

<doc id="644713" wikidata="Q1277124" url="?curid=644713" title="Family (1976 TV series)">
<text>Family is an American television drama series aired on ABC from March 9, 1976, to June 25, 1980. It was conceived as a six-episode limited series, but initial high ratings led to the production of 86 weekly episodes. Creative control of the show was split among executive producers Leonard Goldberg, Aaron Spelling and Mike Nichols.

== Overview ==
&quot;Family&quot; depicted a contemporary traditional family with realistic, believable characters. The show starred Sada Thompson and James Broderick as Kate and Doug Lawrence, an upper-middle-class couple living at 1230 Holland Street in Pasadena, California, with their three children: Nancy (portrayed by Elayne Heilveil in the original miniseries, then by Meredith Baxter), Willie (Gary Frank), and Letitia, nicknamed &quot;Buddy&quot; (Kristy McNichol). Their fourth child, Timmy, died five years before the first season, at age 10, in a boating accident.

&quot;Family&quot; raised the profiles of all its main actors. In particular, it catapulted Kristy McNichol and Meredith Baxter Birney to stardom.

* Kate is practical and rational. She is motivated to do what is right, even if it makes her unpopular (&quot;Jury Duty&quot;). A full-time homemaker, she resents people telling her she could have attained more in life (&quot;Home Movie&quot;). After expressing frustration with the monotony of her existence, she returns to college as a music major and joins the faculty at Buddy&#x27;s high school in season 4. 
* Doug is a calm, steadfast attorney who aspires to be a judge. He listens to and values his wife (although they grapple with issues such as Doug&#x27;s past infidelity and occasional workaholism) and always makes time for his children. 
* Willie is an aspiring writer. He secures his parents&#x27; permission to drop out of high school to write a screenplay; he later earns his GED. Willie pursues work, assisting in a photography studio, an advertising agency, and at a TV show called &quot;The Dame Game.&quot; His frequent romantic affairs drove many of the episodes involving his character.
* Younger daughter Buddy (Letitia) is a tomboy, although she sometimes considers adopting a more feminine appearance (&quot;Coming of Age&quot;). She is a loyal friend, compassionate toward others, and well-liked by her classmates. She has a habit of walking into a room where adults are discussing something confidential and demanding to know what is transpiring. She usually seeks her mother&#x27;s help when faced with a dilemma. Kate often calls her by the nickname &quot;Tizzylish.&quot; Buddy is also very close with older brother Willie, who calls her &quot;Peaches&quot;.
* In the pilot, eldest daughter Nancy Lawrence Maitland catches her husband, Jeff Maitland (recurring guest star John Rubinstein) in bed with another woman. They divorce between seasons one and two. Nancy moves into the family guesthouse with her young son, Timmy (Michael and David Shackelford) and enrolls in law school.
* In season 4, eleven-year-old Andrea &quot;Annie&quot; Cooper (Quinn Cummings) is adopted by the family after her biological parents, Kate and Doug&#x27;s college friends, are killed in a car accident. Annie excels academically and strives to fit in with her new family and classmates at school, not always with success.

Storylines were often topical. In the first episode, Nancy walks in on her husband Jeff having sex with one of her friends. Other storylines include Kate&#x27;s possible breast cancer and Buddy&#x27;s dilemmas about whether to have sex; she always chooses to wait. In 1976&#x27;s &quot;Rites of Friendship&quot;, Willie&#x27;s childhood friend is arrested in a gay bar, while 1977&#x27;s &quot;We Love You, Miss Jessup&quot; deals with Buddy&#x27;s friendship with a lesbian teacher. &quot;Family&quot; also contends with alcoholism (Doug&#x27;s sister; Buddy&#x27;s friend) and dementia: a 1979 episode directed by Joanne Woodward guest-stars Henry Fonda as Doug&#x27;s father, James Lawrence, who is beginning to experience cognitive decline. Two years later, Fonda won an Academy Award for playing a similar character in &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;.

==Episodes and production details==

The initial showrunners of &quot;Family&quot; were Nigel McKeand and Carol Evan McKeand, who had been writers for &quot;The Waltons&quot;. After the fourth season, the McKeands departed and were replaced by Edward Zwick, who later produced the acclaimed series &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, and &quot;Once and Again&quot;.

Exterior shots of the Lawrence family home were filmed at 1230 Milan Avenue in South Pasadena, California.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Family&quot; attracted widespread critical acclaim during its original run. TV critics called the show a rare quality offering in ABC&#x27;s schedule, which included &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; and other Spelling-Goldberg productions such as &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

Despite its occasional adult themes, the National Parent-Teacher Association consistently praised the series. In February 1979, the PTA said &quot;Family&quot; contained &quot;good parenting lessons&quot; and &quot;slightly controversial&quot; but &quot;excellent&quot; content, recommending it for viewing by teens and older.

In the fourth season, some critics took issue with the show&#x27;s direction. In February 1979, Noel Holston of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; called &quot;Family&quot; &quot;ABC&#x27;s most prestigious program&quot; but claimed &quot;the producers&#x27; crisis-of-the-week approach is starting to strain the series&#x27; credibility.&quot; Some critics complained that &quot;Family&quot;, like many TV shows of the period, had become too reliant on sex-related plots. In spring 1979, ABC shifted the show to Friday nights at 8 p.m. Eastern, and its previously solid ratings dropped to the bottom of the chart.

Although &quot;Family&quot; earned solid ratings and a loyal following, ABC was criticized for failing to promote the show; the network never aired summer reruns, which could have expanded its audience. In an interview before &quot;Family&quot;&#x27;s final season, star Sada Thompson called the network &quot;capricious&quot; and the lack of repeats &quot;most unusual&quot;. In December 1979, former showrunners Nigel McKeand and Carol Evan McKeand said, &quot;We worked on that show for 4 1/2 years and there wasn&#x27;t a day during that time that we felt the network (ABC) gave a damn.&quot;

Seven years after the series ended, it was widely reported that a &quot;Family Reunion&quot; TV movie was planned for the 1987–88 season. At least one report indicated that if the movie&#x27;s ratings were strong enough, the series would be revived for the current ABC schedule. The plot was to involve the Lawrence children gathering for Kate&#x27;s remarriage. (James Broderick had died of cancer in 1982.) But the 1988 writers&#x27; strike halted production, and the project was abandoned.

<text>Rusalka (), Op. 114, is an opera (&#x27;lyric fairy tale&#x27;) by Antonín Dvořák. His ninth opera (1900–1901), it became his most successful, frequenting the standard repertoire worldwide. Jaroslav Kvapil wrote the libretto on Karel Jaromír Erben&#x27;s and Božena Němcová&#x27;s fairy tales. The rusalka is a water sprite from Slavic mythology; it usually inhabits a lake or river.

For many years unfamiliarity with Dvořák&#x27;s operas outside the Czech lands helped reinforce a perception that composition of operas was a marginal activity, and that despite the beauty of its melodies and orchestral timbres &quot;Rusalka&quot; was not a central part of his output or of international lyric theatre. In recent years it has been performed more regularly by major opera companies. In the five seasons from 2008 to 2013 it was performed by opera companies worldwide far more than all of Dvořák&#x27;s other operas combined.

The most popular excerpt from &quot;Rusalka&quot; is the soprano aria, the &quot;Song to the Moon&quot; (&quot;&quot;) for the title character in act 1, which is often performed in concert and recorded separately. It has also been arranged for violin and used on film soundtracks.

==Composition history==

Dvořák had played viola for pit orchestras in Prague (the Estates Theatre from 1857 until 1859 while a student, then from 1862 until 1871 at the Provisional Theatre). He thus had direct experience of a wide range of operas by Mozart, Weber, Rossini, Lortzing, Wagner, Verdi as well as his compatriot Smetana. 

Kvapil&#x27;s libretto was written before he had any contact with the composer. The plot contains elements which also appear in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen and in &quot;Undine&quot; by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, and has been described as a &quot;sad, modern fairy tale&quot;, in a similar vein to his previous play, &quot;Princessa Pampeliška&quot;. The libretto was completed by 1899, when Kvapil began looking for composers interested in setting his text to music. His composer friends were engaged with other works, but mentioned that Dvořák was looking for a project. The composer, always interested in Erben&#x27;s stories, read the libretto and composed his opera quite rapidly, with the first draft begun on 22 April 1900 and completed by the end of November. Coming after his four symphonic poems inspired by the folk-ballads of Erben of 1896–97, &quot;Rusalka&quot; may be viewed as the culmination of Dvořák&#x27;s exploration of a &quot;wide variety of drama-creating musical techniques&quot;.

==Performance history==
&quot;Rusalka&quot; was first performed in Prague on 31 March 1901, with Růžena Maturová as the first Rusalka. It became an enormous success in Czech lands, and soon gained success also abroad. Shortly after the premiere Dvořák was in contact with Mahler, then at the Vienna Court Opera about mounting the work there, and having met Mahler signed a contract for a production to take place, but this fell through.

The first performance outside Bohemia took place in Ljubljana. The opera was given in Vienna by a Czech company in 1910; in German translation it was given in Stuttgart in 1935. 

The UK stage premiere was given by John Lewis Opera at Peter Jones, Sloane Square in May 1950. &quot;The Times&quot; commented: &quot;It is left to amateurs to stage for us those operas by composers howsoever eminent which do not get into the international repertory&quot;.
The first professional performances were at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in 1959; a 1983 production by English National Opera was filmed and revived several times.

The United States premiere of the opera was presented by the San Diego Opera in 1975 with Kathryn Bouleyn in the title role. &quot;Rusalka&quot; was first performed in New York at the Metropolitan Opera in 1993, a production from the Vienna State Opera, directed by Otto Schenk, with Gabriela Beňačková and Neil Rosenshein. The 2007 production by Opera Australia with Cheryl Barker in the title role and Richard Hickox conducting won the Helpmann Award for Best Opera.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===

&quot;A meadow by the edge of a lake&quot;

Three wood sprites tease the water goblin, Vodník, ruler of the lake. His daughter Rusalka, a water nymph, tells him that she has fallen in love with a human prince who comes to hunt around the lake, and she wants to become human to embrace him. He tells her it is a bad idea, but nonetheless steers her to a witch, Ježibaba, for assistance. Rusalka sings her &quot;Song to the Moon&quot;, asking it to tell the prince of her love. Ježibaba tells Rusalka that, if she becomes human, she will lose the power of speech and immortality; moreover, if she does not find love with the prince, he will die and she will be eternally damned. Rusalka agrees to the terms and drinks a potion. The prince, hunting a white doe, finds Rusalka, embraces her, and leads her away, as her father and sisters lament.

===Act 2===
&quot;The garden of the prince&#x27;s castle&quot;

A gamekeeper and his nephew, the kitchen boy, note that the prince is to be married to a mute and nameless bride. They suspect witchcraft and doubt it will last, as the prince is already lavishing attentions on a foreign princess who is a wedding guest. The foreign princess, jealous, curses the couple. The prince rejects Rusalka. Rusalka then goes back to the lake with her father the water goblin. Though she has now won the prince&#x27;s affections, the foreign princess is disgusted by the prince&#x27;s fickleness and betrayal and she scorns him, telling him to follow his rejected bride to Hell.

===Act 3===
&quot;A meadow by the edge of a lake&quot;

Rusalka returns to the lake and laments about her fate. She meets Ježibaba and asks for a solution to her woes. Ježibaba gives her a knife and tells her that she can save herself if she kills the prince with it. Rusalka rejects this, throwing the dagger into the lake. Rusalka becomes a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp, a spirit of death living in the depths of the lake, emerging only to lure humans to their deaths. The gamekeeper and the kitchen boy are worried about the deteriorating condition of the prince, and go to the lake in order to get rid of Rusalka. They meet Ježibaba and lash out on Rusalka&#x27;s betrayal, but are rebutted by the water goblin, who says that it was actually the prince that betrayed Rusalka. The wood sprites mourn Rusalka&#x27;s plight. The prince, searching for his white doe, comes to the lake, senses Rusalka, and calls for her. Rusalka appears and is now able to speak to him. He asks her to kiss him, even knowing her kiss means death. They kiss and he dies; and the water goblin comments that all sacrifices are futile. In her final song, Rusalka tells the prince, &quot;For your love, for that beauty of yours, for your inconstant human passion, for everything by which my fate is cursed, human soul, God have mercy on you!&quot;

==Instrumentation==
Rusalka is scored for 2 flutes, 1 piccolo, 2 oboes, 1 English horn, 2 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, percussion, harp and strings.

==Music==
Dvořák&#x27;s music is generally through-composed and uses motifs for Rusalka, her damnation, the water sprite and the forest. His word-setting is expressive while allowing for nationally inflected passages, and &quot;Grove&quot; judges that the work shows the composer at the height of his maturity. He uses established theatrical devices – dance sections, comedy (Gamekeeper and Turnspit) and pictorial musical depiction of nature (forest and lake). Rodney Milnes (who provided the translation for an ENO production) admired the &quot;wealth of melodic patterns that are dramatic in themselves and its shimmering orchestration&quot;. One writer considers the final section of the opera – the duet for the prince and Rusalka – as &quot;[twelve] or so of the most glorious minutes in all opera&quot; in their &quot;majestic, almost hymnic solemnity&quot; while another describes the opera as a &quot;vivid, profoundly disturbing drama&quot;.

In 2014, Slovak conductor and composer Marián Lejava produced a version for chamber orchestra that premiered at Theater Orchester Biel Solothurn in Switzerland that same year and would later be performed in other performing venues.

<text>RTL (from &quot;Radio Télévision Luxembourg&quot;), formerly RTL plus and RTL Television, is a German-language free-to-air television channel owned by RTL Deutschland, headquartered in Cologne. Founded as an offshoot of the German-language radio programme &quot;Radio Luxemburg,&quot; RTL is considered a full-service broadcaster under the &quot;Medienstaatsvertrag&quot; (Interstate Media Treaty) and is the largest private television network in Germany. As of August 2010, RTL employs some 500 permanent staff, having outsourced its news and technical departments. 

In September 2021, &quot;Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland&quot; (RTL Germany Media Group) was renamed RTL Deutschland. As part of the rebrand, both the group and the channel received new logos and branding.

== History ==

RTL plus was already known through the radio station. Even before the broadcast began, the pressure on politicians to introduce private television in Germany was growing in Saarland, which could be reached from the broadcasting systems in Luxembourg. Private television began operations in the Federal Republic of Germany on January 1, 1984 with the two-year Ludwigshafen cable pilot project (Kabelpilotprojekt). It was the birth of PKS (later Sat.1). A day later, RTL plus, which was then broadcasting from Luxembourg and named after the Luxembourg radio and television broadcaster RTL (derived from Radio Télévision Lëtzebuerg, see also RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg), began its German-language program from 5:27 p.m. The unusual broadcast start took place in a small studio in Bertrange with the following scene: Chief doctor Rainer Holbe delivered a television with the RTL-plus logo in a delivery room with his obstetricians. The broadcast times were Monday to Friday from 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. and Saturday to Sunday from 5:30 p.m. to midnight. The first RTL broadcast after the starting signal was the news 7 vor 7 with Hans Meiser and Geert Müller-Gerbes.

RTL plus was famous in its early years for showing low-budget films and American programmes. In 1988, it was the second most-viewed channel in Germany.

After reunification in 1990, broadcasting was extended to the entire country. RTL moved to Cologne and received the right to broadcast on free-to-air frequencies. That same year, RTL acquired the first-run rights to the German Football First Division. Deals with Cannon and Universal Studios finally provided more high-profile films for the channel. In 2012, RTL made a deal with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to air films from its media library until 2016, when it switched to Universal, as Disney Channel was relaunched as a free-to-air channel competing with RTL.

In July 2015, the channel introduced the slogan Willkommen zuhause (Welcome home) to complement Mein RTL, and launched its biggest advertising campaign in 20 years. This tagline (as Willkommen zu Hause, with a space between zu and Hause) was earlier used in the early 2000s.

On 1 September 2017, RTL flattened its logo, with brighter shades of the three colours. The slogan continues to be &quot;Willkommen zuhause&quot;, through &quot;Mein RTL&quot; would be used in rare cases. Another sister channel, n-tv was rebranded on the same day.

As part of a comprehensive restructuring within Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, RTL unveiled a new identity, a new, multi-colourful logo and a new graphics package. The rebrand rolled out on 15 September 2021, as well as RTL Crime, RTL Living and RTL Passion.

<text>Kimberly Jo Zimmer (born February 2, 1955) is an American actress, best known for her role as Reva Shayne on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. For this portrayal, she has won four Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

==Career==
Zimmer&#x27;s career began with stage work; an early television role was her portrayal of the character of Bonnie Harmon on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1978. In 1979, she was tapped to replace Kathleen Turner as Nola Dancy Aldrich on &quot;The Doctors&quot;. (She later appeared opposite Turner in the 1981 film &quot;Body Heat&quot; in a plot that addressed similarities in their appearance.) For much of her stint, she was the show&#x27;s leading lady, but left the show in July 1982 on a maternity leave, escorted off the show by her real life husband, A.C. Weary, who played Nola&#x27;s newest conquest. She would return one last time later in the year for the funeral of her former mother-in-law, Mona Croft. She had a brief return to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from February through November 1983 as Echo DiSavoy.

In 1983, Zimmer was cast in the role for which she is best known, the character of Reva Shayne on the television soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Her portrayal of Reva was a focus of the show until Zimmer left in 1990. She returned to &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in April 1995 and portrayed Reva until the show&#x27;s conclusion in September 2009. While Zimmer&#x27;s Reva was paired with several leading men, her work with Robert Newman (Josh) earned them the label of &quot;supercouple.&quot;

Zimmer left &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in July 1990 and moved to the West Coast for five years, during which she played Jodie DeWitt Walker on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1992 to 1993. In 1995, Zimmer appeared in an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (&quot;The Diplomat&#x27;s Club&quot;), as Mr. Pitt&#x27;s attorney, who suspected Elaine and Jerry were trying to kill Mr. Pitt.

In 2010, Zimmer returned to the role of Echo on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Zimmer was featured in a story along with former &quot;Guiding Light&quot; co-star Jerry verDorn &quot;(Clint Buchanan)&quot;, Robin Strasser &quot;(Dorian Cramer)&quot; and Erika Slezak &quot;(Viki Lord)&quot;.

Zimmer has also appeared in several episodic television programs, including &quot;Designing Women&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Models, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (episode &quot;And Now For a Word&quot;, year 1995). She also appeared in several made-for-television movies.

Zimmer has starred in a number of theater roles, including several at Augusta&#x27;s Barn Theatre. In 2011, it was announced that Zimmer would be cast in the Off-Broadway international hit &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;. She starred as Mrs. Hayes in Connecticut Repertory Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Odysseus D.O.A.&quot;, running through March 4, 2012. Zimmer made her musical theatre debut when she joined the first North American tour of Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Wicked&quot;. She played the role of Madame Morrible from 14 August 2012 through 13 December 2013. Zimmer returned to the role with the first North American tour on 30 September 2014. Zimmer has also appeared in several productions of the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;, first in 2006 at the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan, and in 2015 at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera opposite former &quot;Guiding Light&quot; leading man Robert Newman.

In 2011 she released her memoir called &quot; I&#x27;m Just Sayin&#x27;!: Three Deaths, Seven Husbands and a Clone! My Life as a Daytime Diva&quot;.

In 2023, after several years off-screen, Zimmer returned to acting starring in the drama film &quot;You Sing Louder, I Sing Louder&quot; starring opposite Ewan McGregor and her son Jake Weary.

==Personal life==
Zimmer was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the daughter of Burdina Elva (known as &quot;Dede&quot;) Zimmer and Walter Jack Zimmer. She has an older sister Karen Ann (née Zimmer) Witzel. She graduated from Forest Hills Central High School in Ada Township, which is just east of Grand Rapids, and then studied at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, and at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. She is married to actor/director A.C. Weary (Allen Cudney Weary), and they have three children: Rachel, Max, and Jake Weary. Jake is also an actor; he appeared on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as Luke Snyder in 2005, and has had various guest roles, including on &quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and currently stars as Deran Cody in &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;. She resides in Montclair, New Jersey.

On May 16, 2024, during an appearance on a special Stand Up to Cancer benefit episode of the YouTube podcast series &quot;The Locher Room&quot;, Zimmer revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2023 and was undergoing treatment.

<doc id="644753" wikidata="Q7410155" url="?curid=644753" title="Samples per inch">
<text>Samples per inch (SPI) is a measurement of the resolution of an image scanner, in particular the number of individual samples that are taken in the space of one linear inch. It is sometimes misreferred to as dots per inch, though that term more accurately refers to printing resolution. Generally, the greater the SPI of a scanner, the more detailed its reproduction of the scanned object.

Typical consumer-level flatbed scanners are capable of optical resolution ranging from 100 to 2400 SPI; high-end scanners may have an optical resolution of 4800 SPI or more. Many scanners use interpolation techniques to achieve a higher effective SPI rating, with some manufacturers offering nearly one million SPI, though the quality is primarily limited by the optical resolution; interpolated SPI does not provide additional pixels in the scanned image.

Horizontal and vertical SPI ratings may differ for a given scanner; typical flatbed scanners use a horizontal array of sensors that are passed across the bed using an electric stepper motor. The density of the array of sensors determines the horizontal scanning resolution, while the minimum step size of the motor determines the vertical resolution. Similar characteristics are present in drum scanners, which continuously spin the item being scanned past the sensor array for numerous imaging passes.

To calculate the number of raw data bytes that a scanned image will take up, you can use the follow formula :
formula_1

Where :
&quot;vSPI&quot; is the vertical SPI
&quot;hSPI&quot; is the horizontal SPI (can be considered the same as vSPI if not specified specifically)
&quot;area&quot; is the squared area of the scanned document in inches²
&quot;color depth encoding&quot; is the number of bits used to encode a given amount of color information (256 colors=8; 65&#x27;536 colors=16; 16million colors=24)
Remember that this will give raw data bytes, images are almost always compressed when saved to disk using lossless (like PNG, TIFF) or lossy image formats (like JPEG).

<doc id="644754" wikidata="Q2340742" url="?curid=644754" title="Irna Phillips">
<text>Irna Phillips (July 1, 1901 – December 23, 1973) was an American scriptwriter, screenwriter, casting agent, and actress who pioneered a style of daytime soap opera in the United States geared specifically toward women. Phillips created, produced, and wrote several radio and television daytime serials throughout her career, including &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, and &quot;Another World&quot;. She was also a mentor to several other pioneers of the American daytime soap opera, including Agnes Nixon, William J. Bell and Ted Corday.

==Personal life==
Phillips was one of 10 children born to a German-Jewish family in Chicago. Her father died when she was 8, leaving her mother alone to raise the children. She claimed to be a lonely child always given hand-me-down clothes and making up long and involved stories for her dolls to live out. At 19, she was pregnant, abandoned by her boyfriend, and then gave birth to a still-born baby. She studied drama at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (where she became a member of Phi Sigma Sigma sorority), receiving a Master of Arts degree before going on to earn a master&#x27;s degree in journalism at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. 

Phillips wanted to be an actress, but her teachers told her she was too plain to have any real success. From 1925 to 1930, she worked as a school teacher in Dayton, Ohio, teaching drama and theatre history to schoolchildren. While working in this capacity she continued to attempt a career as an actress, and after performing several acting roles for radio productions at WGN in Chicago, she left her career as a teacher. At the age of 42, Phillips adopted a son, Thomas Dirk Phillips. A year later, she adopted a daughter, Katherine Louise Phillips.

==Career==
===Early radio career: &quot;Painted Dreams&quot; and &quot;Woman in White&quot; (1930–40)===
After working as a staff writer on a daytime talk show, Phillips created the serial &quot;Painted Dreams&quot;, which aired daily except Sundays on local Chicago station WGN. Phillips wrote every episode of the series in addition being a starring cast member as the characters Mother Moynihan and Sue Morton. Mother Moynihan was a widowed matriarch of a large Irish-American family. Phillips based Mother Moynihan&#x27;s struggles on her own mother&#x27;s obstacles. After creating, producing and starring in &quot;Painted Dreams&quot;, Phillips became credited with innovating a daytime serial format for radio geared toward women. Later known as “Queen of the Soaps”, she introduced techniques such as the organ bridge to give a smooth flow between scenes and the cliff-hanger ending to each episode.

Phillips endured much disapproval for her writing, especially from sponsors like Procter &amp; Gamble. The radio business during the 1930s was heavily male-dominated, and as result, it was claimed the audience for Phillips&#x27; serials were childlike, unrealistic, vulgar, and distasteful. In reality, her female characters were depicted as strong women with options, education, and personality. Phillips&#x27; characters were not something of the ordinary for the stereotypical 1930s women. No regular male roles were introduced until later in the series&#x27; run. The conflict most basic to the programs&#x27; dramatic structure was that between traditional and changing gender roles: Irene Moynihan, the daughter was characterized as the “aspiring modern girl, with ambitions toward a career”, against Mother Moynihan&#x27;s and Sue Morton&#x27;s more traditional views. Although &quot;Painted Dreams&quot; began as an unsponsored program, Phillips believed that a radio series must be a &quot;utility to its sponsors&quot; and that it must &quot;actually sell merchandise; otherwise the object of radio advertising has failed&quot;. With this in mind, she wrote in an engagement and a wedding which provided the possibility of product tie-ins. 

In 1932, Phillips urged WGN to sell &quot;Painted Dreams&quot; to a national network. When they refused, Phillips took them to court, claiming the series as her own property. WGN manager Henry Selinger claimed to have come up with the original daytime serial to sell products for women. However, Phillips was hired to write as well as perform in this first series. Disputes of ownership over the innovative serial ended Phillips&#x27; association with WGN and she was picked up by opponent station WMAQ. &quot;Painted Dreams&quot; was then changed to &quot;Today’s Children&quot; featuring the same plot and debate over starting a career or starting a family. Phillips had then learned to retain all rights and ownership to her newly titled show and the many that followed during her career. 

By 1938, &quot;Painted Dreams&quot; emerged from the courts and was purchased by CBS. The nature of the court settlement prohibited Phillips from any future involvement with the series. That year, when Phillips&#x27;s mother died, she demanded that &quot;Today&#x27;s Children&quot; be discontinued out of respect. CBS agreed and replaced it with her new series, &quot;Woman in White&quot;, a serial which focused on the internal workings of a hospital; it was one of the first daytime serials to be set in a hospital. It was on &quot;Woman in White&quot; that Phillips first began working with Agnes Nixon. William J. Bell also began his apprenticeship under Phillips during her radio days. 

===Radio and television series: &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1940–60)===

In 1937, Phillips collaborated with Emmons Carlson on her third radio serial, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; (shortened to simply &quot;Guiding Light&quot; after 1975), basing it on personal experiences; after giving birth to a stillborn child at age 19, she found spiritual comfort listening to sermons by a preacher of a church centered on the brotherhood of man. It was these sermons that formed the nucleus of the creation of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;. From 1937 to 1946, the series was broadcast from Chicago on the NBC radio network. The show was cancelled by NBC twice; once in 1939, and once in 1946. After the first time on October 13, 1939, it was brought back by popular demand of the listening audience and began again only four months later on January 22, 1940. NBC cancelled the series a second time on November 29, 1946, coinciding with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission forcing a split of NBC and the creation of the ABC network. CBS would pick up the series seven months later on June 2, 1947, where it transferred to television in June 1952, and where it would stay for the remainder of its run until its television conclusion in September 2009.

In the 1940s, Phillips wrote two million words a year, dictated six to eight hours a day, and earned $250,000 a year. Her other serials of the era included &quot;The Right to Happiness&quot; (1939–60) and &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; (1954–62). In 1938, Phillips supervised the creation of the tie-in book, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, published by The Guiding Light Co. of 360 North Michigan Avenue Chicago, Illinois. The book traced the backstory of the radio series, told from the point of view of the &quot;keeper of the guiding light&quot;, Reverend John Ruthledge.

In 1949, Phillips created the first serial broadcast on a major television network, &quot;These Are My Children&quot;, which ran on NBC for one month. In 1956, she created &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, one of the first two daytime serials to run a half-hour in length (the other being &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which premiered on CBS the same day). Within two years, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; had become the highest-rated drama, a position it would retain for over two decades. Within six months of the series&#x27; debut, Phillips fired lead actress Helen Wagner because she reportedly did not like the way she poured coffee. Procter &amp; Gamble and CBS both backed Wagner, and Phillips was forced to rehire her. Wagner remained as a cast member on the series until her death in 2010, just months before &quot;As the World Turns&quot; concluded.

===Final years: &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; and return to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1964–73)===
Phillips co-created &quot;Another World&quot; with William J. Bell in 1964, originally planned as a sister show to &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Although Procter &amp; Gamble owned both series, CBS had no room for the program and rival network NBC acquired broadcast rights. Phillips fired veteran actor John Beal from &quot;Another World&quot; after only one episode, and actress Fran Sharon after two weeks. Actress Kay Campbell stated, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget once on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, Rosemary Prinz did a scene, and when we were only off the air five minutes, Irna was on the phone and tore her to pieces. I don&#x27;t think Irna liked actors.&quot; Phillips and Bell would cede the head writing role at &quot;Another World&quot; to James Lipton; Agnes Nixon would succeed him.

In 1965, Phillips was a story editor for &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and was a story consultant on &quot;Peyton Place&quot; before co-creating &quot;Our Private World&quot;, the first primetime series to be spun off from a daytime serial. The series featured the &quot;As the World Turns&quot; character Lisa Miller; the series ran during the spring, summer and early fall of 1965, before being cancelled. She left &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; when CBS censors refused to fully tell a love story involving an Amerasian woman (born out of the love affair in the original film) and a white man. CBS and Twentieth Century-Fox Television were co- producers of the show. All 1,430 episodes of &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; were recorded on videotape at CBS Broadcast Center Studio 41 in New York.

Phillips was the unofficial story editor for &quot;A World Apart&quot;, an ABC soap opera that was created by her daughter, Katherine. One of the main characters was a soap opera writer who lived in Chicago and was in charge of a soap opera in New York. Soon after, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; asked her to come back and write for them. Phillips introduced a number of characters to the show and integrated them with the core Hughes family. Her new story, and the show&#x27;s new heroine, Kimberly Sullivan (Kathryn Hays), became involved with longtime hero, Bob Hughes (Don Hastings). Bob was married to Kim&#x27;s sister Jennifer, but Phillips had Kim seduce Bob. She became pregnant. P&amp;G fired Phillips in early 1973; it was to be her last writing gig.

On January 25, 2007, in an episode celebrating the 70th Anniversary of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, the current cast portrayed actors and behind-the-scenes personnel from the early years of the series (both radio and TV). Beth Ehlers played Phillips, and several incidents in her life were fictionalized in the series.

Phillips was a fiercely independent entrepreneur who retained ownership rights to all her series, producing through Carl Wester and Company and allowing agencies, sponsors, and networks little control over her soap opera empire.

<text>Sunset Beach is an American television soap opera that aired on NBC from January 6, 1997, to December 31, 1999. The show follows the loves and lives of the people living in the Orange County coastal area named Sunset Beach, on the coast of California. Although there is a real community named Sunset Beach (now part of the city of Huntington Beach), the show&#x27;s beach scenes were shot in nearby Seal Beach, California. The show was co-produced by NBC and Spelling Television.

&quot;Sunset Beach&quot; won two Daytime Emmy Awards and was nominated another eleven times. The show also received 22 nominations for various other awards.

==Conception and development==
Developed as a co-production between its NBC Studios unit and Spelling Television (which formed a standalone daytime production subsidiary specifically for the program), &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; was ordered to series by NBC in 1996, in an attempt to both rebuild the network&#x27;s daytime lineup and target younger audiences. Charles Pratt, Jr. (who would also serve as an executive consultant), Robert Guza, Jr. and Josh Griffith were hired to develop the concept for the new series. Pratt, Guza and Griffith had met in 1988 when the latter two joined series veteran Pratt as writers for the NBC soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;; Pratt and Guza first met Spelling in 1992, when the two became part of the original writing staff of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and went on to work on its short-lived spinoff &quot;Models Inc.&quot;

&quot;Sunset Beach&quot; was the first (and only) daytime soap opera produced by Aaron Spelling, and NBC&#x27;s first new serial since the 1991 cancellation of &quot;Generations&quot; (which was also produced by the network&#x27;s production division). Spelling had experience in the genre producing several primetime soap operas (most notably &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;), and was also the executive producer of the 1991 film &quot;Soapdish&quot;, a satirical look at daytime soap operas.

Jonathan Levin, one of the show&#x27;s consulting producers, commented on the change that a new soap opera brings to the lineup, and the tough process of a viewer getting to know a new soap: &quot;It is very difficult to change the loyalty of the daytime viewer, and we’re talking about shows that have been on for 30 years. That&#x27;s one of the reasons we’re targeting young viewers — they’re the most available and the most flexible in their viewing habits.&quot;

In the process of making the show, Spelling liked the idea of naming it &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;, as suggested by Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone during a dinner with Spelling, but later tests proved that the viewers were more drawn to the title &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;. The soap opera debuted on January 6, 1997.

==Cast and crew==
When the show began, it had 21 contract actors, including Lesley-Anne Down (Olivia Richards), Sam Behrens (Gregory Richards), Leigh Taylor-Young (Elaine Stevens), Peter Barton (Eddie Connors), Laura Harring (Paula Stevens), Hank Cheyne (Ricardo Torres) and Kathleen Noone (Bette Katzenkazrahi). In its first year and a half on air, seven actors left the show. Adrienne Frantz was the first to be let go from her role of Tiffany Thorne. The character was recast to Jennifer Banko-Stewart, but this was not successful and she was eventually written out. Kelly Hu left the show in June 1997, due to her character not mixing well with the others. By the end of the year, when Meg Bennett took over as a new head writer, Taylor-Young and Harring also left the series, followed by the exit of Nick Stabile, whose character Mark Wolper was written out in a serial killer storyline. Elizabeth Alley had a short stint playing the role of Melinda Fall. The final original character to be written out was Eddie Connors (Barton), who exited in May 1998.

Shortly after the show premiered, Dominique Jennings, V. P. Oliver, and Russell Curry joined the cast as Virginia Harrison, Jimmy Harrison, and Tyus Robinson respectively. Oliver was let go in December 1997, and his character was recast with a younger actor, Jeffery Wood. Both Jennings and Wood were written out by March 1999, exactly two years after the introduction of their characters. The remaining 14 original characters stayed on the show until its end, and three of those characters were recast during the three-year run. The first recast happened soon after the show started airing. The role of Cole Deschanel a male jewel thief, initially played by Ashley Hamilton, was recast to Eddie Cibrian. In mid-1998, Vanessa Dorman vacated the role of Cole&#x27;s partner Caitlin Deschanel due to a change in storyline direction, and Kam Heskin was cast. The final recast was a temporary one. When Susan Ward left to film a movie, Sydney Penny stepped in to replace her, with Ward later returning to play the character for the show&#x27;s final few weeks.

The exits of many characters opened the doors to the introduction of new ones. Carol Potter and John H. Martin, who had been recurring during the show&#x27;s first year, were promoted to contract status, and the expansion of Meg&#x27;s family also included the arrival of her sister Sara Cummings. The role was first played by then-unknown actress Lauren Woodland, but she was fired two weeks later and replaced by Shawn Batten, who played the role for the remainder of the series. Aside from Meg&#x27;s family, Ricardo Torres got his family expanded, including the introduction of his mother Carmen (Margarita Cordova), brother Antonio (Nick Kiriazis), and the sudden reappearance of his sister Maria (Christina Chambers), Ben Evans&#x27; presumed dead wife.

The teen scene was revived in 1998, when Bette&#x27;s daughter Emily Davis (Cristi Harris) arrived in town and fell in love with Sean, prompting Amy (Krissy Carlson) and Brad (Michael Strickland) to intervene. The final teen cast was Leo Deschanel, Cole&#x27;s brother (David Mathiessen), but he was quickly written out. A long-time legend and Cole&#x27;s father, A.J. Deschanel, was also cast in the form of Gordon Thomson, and a female jewel thief named Francesca (Lisa Guerrero) was added to the cast in mid-1998. However, Guerrero was written out in early 1999 since her character was killed by Gregory.

In 1999, the show cast only three contract roles, the first two being in March, when Tracy Lindsey Melchior and Chasen Parker stunned the soap with their sudden arrival in town. The final role to be cast on the show was the one played by Sean Kanan in late August. Things changed at the end of the year, when Cibrian left the show to pursue a career in primetime. Several other cast members, including a few original ones, considered leaving, but the show&#x27;s cancellation came before they could make a decision.

During its three-year run, &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; was executive produced by Aaron Spelling, E. Duke Vincent, and Gary Tomlin. However, the head writing history was much different. Robert Guza Jr. was the first head writer (and also a co-creator), but he exited the show on October 21, 1997, when Meg Bennett, who had been serving as Associate Head Writer was promoted as head writer as of October 22. Four months after being the sole head writer, Bennett received a co-head writer in the form of Christopher Whitesell, on January 8, 1998. Bennett was dismissed during the summer of 1998 and her final episode aired October 5, 1998. She was replaced by Margaret DePriest, who stayed with the show until its cancellation.

==Storylines==
Storylines in its nearly three-year run ranged from the traditional to the supernatural. One of the first storylines concerned an Internet romance. Kansas farm girl Meg Cummings discovered her fiancé, Tim Truman, cheating on her on their wedding day. Meg had been talking online with SB, a man who lived in Sunset Beach, California. And after catching Tim with her maid of honor, Meg fled to Sunset Beach in search of SB, who turned out to be wealthy, widowed businessman Ben Evans.

The first year of the show revolved around Meg&#x27;s pursuit of Ben (including her briefly breaking into his house, stealing a journal she found there, and dressing up in his late wife&#x27;s clothes), who was initially not interested in her, and the gradual development of a romance between them. A side plot showed the antagonistic relationship between Meg and Annie Douglas, Ben&#x27;s longtime best friend. Meg hated Annie for being close to Ben and wanted to cut her out of his life; Annie hated Meg out of jealousy for her developing romance with Ben. Their problems reached a head with a physical fight in a hot tub. Meg&#x27;s ex-fiancé Tim Truman followed her to Sunset Beach to win her back, and ended up becoming Annie&#x27;s ally and almost love interest. Once Meg and Annie had overcome their differences, Meg soon had a new problem when she began to suspect Ben was a murderer, although this plot line was developed to lead up to the Terror Island storyline. After the Terror Island/Derek storyline (see below) none of the issues raised were ever mentioned again.

Meg and Ben became one of the show&#x27;s first couples, along with jewel thief Cole Deschanel and local heiress Caitlin Richards. Cole slept with and impregnated both Caitlin and Caitlin&#x27;s unhappy alcoholic mother Olivia Richards. Olivia and her fiendish ex-husband, Gregory Richards, planned to steal Caitlin&#x27;s baby and pass it off as Olivia&#x27;s (telling Caitlin her baby had died) in order to break up Caitlin&#x27;s relationship with Cole, who her parents disapproved of because of his criminal past. Caitlin lost the child in a car accident when she found out about her parents&#x27; horrible plan, and planned to fake the rest of her pregnancy and adopt a baby to pass off as her own, as she was worried her inability to have children (caused by the accident) would cause problems in her marriage to Cole. She enlisted the help of Annie, who was secretly trying to break up Olivia and Gregory, due to a term in her father&#x27;s will that stated she would only get her inheritance if she wed Gregory (her father&#x27;s way of breaking up his marriage to Olivia, who he had been having an affair with) Annie drugged Olivia and stole her baby, telling her the baby had been stillborn. Caitlin (unknowingly) raised her baby half-brother (who was also her step-son, having been fathered by her husband) until a grief-stricken Olivia discovered the truth. Olivia was eventually reunited with her son.

When the show began, it was the only soap on the air featuring Asian-American characters, though they were written off before the end of the first year. The show also had daytime television&#x27;s only African-American villainess, Virginia Harrison, who schemed to break up lifeguard Michael Bourne and reporter Vanessa Hart so she could have Michael for herself.

===Prominent storylines===
In one of the most outrageous storylines on the show, Virginia drugged Vanessa and, using a baster and some stolen sperm, impregnated her with the child of Tyus Robinson, to make it appear Vanessa had been unfaithful to Michael, who was infertile.

The show was known for other outrageous storylines, such as &quot;Terror Island&quot; in which several of the show&#x27;s main characters were stranded on an island with a masked serial killer (whose costume bore a close resemblance to that of the killer from &quot;Scream&quot;) intent on killing them, especially Meg. A handful of characters were killed by the maniac, mostly minor characters introduced as serial killer-fodder, but also one lead character, young runaway made good Mark Wolper. In his dying moments Mark pulled off the killer&#x27;s mask and audiences were stunned to see Ben&#x27;s face behind it. As it turned out, Ben had an evil twin, Derek Evans, who plagued Ben and Meg&#x27;s lives off and on for the rest of the run of the show. Derek was killed after being shot in a struggle with Ben during the show&#x27;s final weeks, following a long storyline where Derek kidnapped and impersonated his twin for months, sleeping with Ben&#x27;s wife Maria Torres (having previously also slept with Meg).

Maria Torres, who had wed Ben when she was still a teenager and he was barely in his twenties, had disappeared and been presumed drowned after a boating accident that took place some years prior to the start of the show. Ben was haunted by the terrible secret that he had caught her in bed with Derek (it was later revealed that Derek—who had impersonated Ben to Maria, who was unaware Ben had a twin—had not slept with Maria, as she had stabbed him with scissors when he tried to rape her). Ben&#x27;s guilt and grief over Maria caused a shadow over his relationship with Meg from the beginning, which worsened when an amnesiac Maria came back from the dead at Ben and Meg&#x27;s October 1998 wedding. Ben and Maria grew closer while he helped her to regain her memory, and once she did, Ben flip flopped between the two women for much of the rest of the show&#x27;s run. During the show&#x27;s last year a strange woman, Tess, turned up on his doorstep with a son she claimed was Ben and Maria&#x27;s. After a positive paternity test they raised the child, Benjy, together, causing even more problems for Meg, who left Ben and briefly started dating her sister&#x27;s boyfriend, Casey Mitchum. Derek (who was also wrongfully presumed dead) returned to kidnap Ben again, and it was revealed he and Tess were Benjy&#x27;s parents.

Another outrageous storyline was the earthquake/tsunami story, in which Sunset Beach was struck by a massive earthquake, trapping many characters – most of them each other&#x27;s rival – together in life and death situations. While half the cast battled the disaster on land, the rest of the cast was on a pleasure cruise aboard a ship that was overturned – à la &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; – by a tsunami created by the earthquake.

The tsunami storyline proved so popular that two weeks&#x27; worth of episodes were compiled and turned into an hour-long show that was included on NBC&#x27;s lineup for one night in August 1998. The show took a supernatural turn for a while with some cursed jewels, stolen from a religious icon, that turned those who&#x27;d touched them into shrivelled mummies. The story culminated on Christmas Eve with the return of the jewels to the Madonna just in time to prevent the deaths of several key characters.

The show also featured two murder mysteries in its run. The first was the murder of Annie&#x27;s father Del Douglas by Elaine Stevens. Del had kidnapped Cole as a baby and convinced Elaine the child was dead. The second murder mystery involved the death of seductress and jewel thief Francesca Vargas, whom just about everyone in town wanted dead. The twist in the Who Shot Francesca storyline and the killer was main antagonist character Gregory Richards.

===Cancellation===
The show was cancelled just before the third anniversary of its original air date. Most of the main characters were given happy endings. Ben and Meg and Michael and Vanessa married in a double wedding. Casey and Sara got engaged, Cole and Caitlin were happy in their marriage, and Olivia was happily raising her children alone. Maria gave Ben a divorce so he could marry Meg and met a new man, Ross English. Maria also adopted Benjy, the little boy she had regarded as her own, and she and Ben planned to raise him together. The &#x27;baddies&#x27; all got their comeuppances. Derek was accidentally shot and killed by Ben; his accomplice Tess went to jail, as did Gregory Richards (Francesca&#x27;s real killer). Tim Truman, who though not a villain spent most of the three years causing problems for Ben and Meg, was murdered by Derek. Virginia remained in a mental hospital of the criminally insane, while reformed Annie also got a happy ending, finding love with relatively new character Jude.

In a twist ending, Meg appeared to wake up in Kansas and realize that the entire three years in Sunset Beach had been a dream – and the characters from the show were actually her friends and family in Kansas (a reference to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;). However, at the last minute, Meg woke up in Sunset Beach and was in bed with Ben, the day after their wedding. Probably the dream was poking fun at how many writers use the sloppy ending of &quot;it was all a dream&quot; to bring a story to a close, as was done in stories such as &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; or more aptly, evoking the dream (9th) season of the prime-time soap, &quot;Dallas&quot;.

==Broadcast history==
Upon its premiere, &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; was made part of NBC&#x27;s daytime programming block; the show began airing on January 6, 1997. At first, the show was given a one-year deal, with 255 episodes to produce. NBC reclaimed the 12:00 pm hour from its affiliates in order to air the series in a more optimal timeslot, in exchange for giving them back the 10:00 am hour; in turn, the low-rated daytime newsmagazine &quot;Real Life with Jane Pauley&quot; (which occupied the earlier 10:00 timeslot) was cancelled to make room for &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; on the lineup.

Like all the other lower-rated daytime shows before it, however, not all of NBC&#x27;s affiliates would air &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; at its scheduled time due to their continuous longstanding practice of airing local newscasts or other syndicated programming in that hour; this resulted in some NBC stations airing the show in a different spot on their schedule while others did not air it at all, often relegating it either to other network affiliates or independent stations in some media markets (especially in Detroit and Houston, where affiliates WDIV-TV and KPRC-TV, both owned by what was then Post-Newsweek Stations (now Graham Media Group), preempted it for its entire run; NBC arranged to have then-UPN stations WKBD-TV and KTXH air the series in their place). In the markets that did air &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; at its scheduled time, the show&#x27;s first half-hour faced off against local newscasts from other network affiliates while its second half-hour went up against the first half-hour of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; on CBS and &quot;Port Charles&quot; on ABC.

In addition to its regular daytime airings, NBC ran same-day rebroadcasts of &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; as one of the initial offerings of the network&#x27;s &quot;NBC All Night&quot; block, which premiered on September 21, 1998 as a replacement for the overnight newscast &quot;NBC Nightside&quot;. As such, it was the only soap opera ever to have aired as part of a network&#x27;s late-night schedule (overnight soap opera broadcasts typically occur at the discretion of local affiliates in the event of preemptions caused by extended breaking news or severe weather coverage). Overnight repeats of &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; continued until the end of the show&#x27;s run.

Through its short existence, &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; remained in the daytime Nielsen ratings basement, despite being renewed twice. During the &quot;Shockwave&quot; storyline, it received its best ratings and showed signs that it might move off the bottom. However, this spike proved to be brief and was not sustained. As a result of all this, NBC cancelled &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; on September 17, 1999 and aired its last episode on December 31 of that year. The show&#x27;s cancellation marked the last time that NBC would feature three serials on its daytime schedule: before the series&#x27; debut, the long-running &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot; (the latter replaced by &quot;Passions&quot; in June 1999) were the only soaps on the network following the 1993 cancellation of &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, while the remainder of its daytime lineup was filled solely by unscripted talk and lifestyle programs until &quot;Today&quot; was expanded to a third hour in September 2000.

To date, &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; is the last regularly-scheduled NBC network program to air anywhere in the 12:00pm hour; NBC returned the hour to its affiliates after the show ended its run. As of October 6, 2003, three days after &quot;Port Charles&quot; aired its last episode, the 12:00pm hour is currently used by all network affiliates, especially those of NBC, for their midday local newscasts as well as other programing; the lone exception is CBS, which continues to air &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; at 12:30pm.

The show, however, gained a cult following in the UK, doing especially well in the ratings for Channel 5, with some universities holding &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; parties where students would go dressed as their favorite character. Channel 5 tried to save the show when its cancellation was announced, offering partially to fund it and trying to get other networks involved, as had happened previously with &quot;Baywatch&quot;, but NBC was not interested. It did buy NBC&#x27;s other soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, to air in &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;’s place, even running promos during the show&#x27;s final week, but &quot;Days&quot; failed to catch on and Channel 5 dropped the show approximately a year later.

Others ran only on satellite and cable channels). It became one of Channel 5s earliest successful imports, being part of its daytime launch schedule, so much so, when it ended in 1999, Channel 5 were a part of an international consortium who tried to invest in &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; to keep it being produced for its large international audience, but this bid failed, and it ended on this channel in 2000.

==References and casting==

===Satire and pop culture references===
It frequently referenced other television shows: many episodes featured characters fantasizing about their lives and dreams in sequences that show the cast dressed as &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; or performing the opening from &quot;Friends&quot;.

Fantasies involving the character Annie Douglas Richards included take offs of &quot;Leeza&quot; and &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; (titled &quot;Murderer of the Day&quot;), which guest-starred their respective hosts. Annie fantasized about being a superhero, had a play of the movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, a play on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, and even her own imaginary soap opera titled &quot;The Search for Dignity&quot;. Plus, the character of Annie was usually the one to deliver funny quotes.

In his biography, the Italian fashion model Den Harrow says that in 1997 he moved to California to take part in the serial.

===Stunt casting guest appearances===
The show went in for stunt casting guest appearances – Jerry Springer played talk show host Jerry Feller and a census taker, Marla Maples played socialite Barbara Birch, Joseph Wapner played himself – and featured a ripped from the headline story about a Washington intern, Meg&#x27;s sister Sara Cummings (Shawn Batten), who&#x27;d had an affair with a married politician. Her affair was exposed by her supposed friend – Melinda Fall (Elizabeth Alley), a take off on Linda Tripp. Sara went on to develop a relationship with local lifeguard Casey Mitchum, and their relationship and her sibling rivalry with her sister (who at one point started an affair with Casey) made up the bulk of Sara&#x27;s storylines, although she was also famous for her TV show-inspired fantasy sequences, which included spoofs of the opening titles for &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

Other notable guest appearances include Finola Hughes as Cole&#x27;s ex-fiancée Helena, Christopher Darden as Les Gordon, John O&#x27;Hurley as the host of &quot;Wheel of Misfortune&quot;, Kim Alexis as a hotel maid, Jack Wagner as a thief named Jacques Dumont, and Barbara Mandrell as Casey&#x27;s ill mother Alex Mitchum.

<text>Loving is an American television soap opera that ran on ABC from June 26, 1983, to November 10, 1995, for a total of 3,169 episodes. The serial, set in the fictional town of Corinth, Pennsylvania, was co-created by Agnes Nixon and former actor Douglas Marland.

&quot;Loving&quot; premiered on June 26, 1983, with a two-hour primetime movie and, on the next day, debuted as a half-hour weekday soap opera.

On July 4, 1995, ABC officially canceled &quot;Loving&quot; due to low ratings, and its final episode aired on November 10, 1995. On November 13, 1995, the following Monday, ABC replaced &quot;Loving&quot; with its spin-off &quot;The City&quot;, which ran until March 28, 1997.

== History ==
With the established and successful ABC daytime soap operas veering into a new trend of youth orientation and storylines with more action and adventure, soap creator Agnes Nixon and actor/writer Douglas Marland sought to create a new serial that would be introduced as a traditional, classic soap opera for the 1980s. Romance would be the show&#x27;s key centerpiece; its original working title was &quot;Love Without End&quot;. By early 1983, the new creation was fully developed as &quot;Loving&quot;, with a cast set for both a primetime premiere and a weekday run.

&quot;Loving&quot; premiered on June 26, 1983, as a two-hour primetime movie. It starred much of the original cast and featured film actors Lloyd Bridges and Geraldine Page. Set in the fictional town of Corinth, Pennsylvania, the early years of the show revolved around the blue-collar Donovans and the blue-blood Aldens. Major social issues such as incest, alcoholism, and post-traumatic stress syndrome of Vietnam veterans were covered. Marland and Nixon left the series after a few years and in spite of ABC&#x27;s bumping down &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; to give &quot;Loving&quot; a choice timeslot, and cast additions of such popular &quot;All My Children&quot; stars as Debbi Morgan and Jean LeClerc, the ratings remained low throughout the show&#x27;s run. &quot;Loving&quot; suffered from a constant revolving door of writers and producers, leading to questionable story moments such as a heroine&#x27;s addiction to cough syrup and one character&#x27;s selling his soul to the Devil. Circumstances became so desperate in the early 1990s that, in order to keep the show afloat, ABC assigned its own programming executives, network executive Haidee Granger and later, Vice President of Daytime Programming JoAnn Emmerich, to serve as executive producers. Despite its frequent subpar ratings, on June 26, 1993, &quot;Loving&quot; celebrated its 10th anniversary on ABC.

Long-running characters included Ava Rescott (played by Patty Lotz, 1983–1984; Roya Megnot, 1984–1988; Lisa Peluso, 1988–1995), a schemer whose adventures ranged from stuffing a pillow in her dress to simulate pregnancy to being kidnapped at Universal Studios to being menaced by her lover&#x27;s identical twin. Other longtime favorites included Stacey Donovan Forbes (portrayed by Lauren-Marie Taylor, the only continuously running original cast member), who was killed off via a poisoned powder puff in summer 1995; boarding house owner Kate Rescott (Nada Rowand), whose tenants often included teen and young adult characters in trouble, or in numerous romantic entanglements; and Gwyneth Alden (played for the majority of the run by Christine Tudor), the long-suffering matriarch who never stopped loving her roguish ex, Clay, or her mentally disturbed children, Trisha and Curtis.

In early 1995, ABC Daytime planned to cancel the show and asked new head writers James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten to find a way to salvage a few components of the series. The writers embarked upon the show&#x27;s last big storyline, the Corinth serial killer. Stacey, Clay, Curtis, Cabot, Isabelle, and Jeremy lost their lives, culminating in the revelation that an insane Gwyn had murdered most of her friends and family in a bid to &quot;make their pain go away.&quot; Gwyn then injected herself with poison before the police could take her into custody. &quot;Loving&quot; characters Ally, Alex, Angie, Buck, Frankie, Jacob, Steffi, Jocelyn, Richard, Tony, Danny and Tess moved to New York City&#x27;s SoHo District and began a new series, &quot;The City&quot;, which would run until the series finale on March 28, 1997.

In August 2013, the serial killer storyline was revisited on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Luke Spencer and Holly Sutton found their way into the abandoned Alden mansion, in pursuit of an adversary who was hiding out in Corinth. Framed photographs of Gwyneth, Trisha and Cabot Alden could be seen, as Luke and Holly recounted the story of &quot;The Loving Murders&quot;. Holly ruminated upon Gwyn&#x27;s rationale for being the killer as being her need to &quot;spare the people she loved from their pain.&quot; Following this, Luke found his ex-wife Laura tied up in the Alden family basement.

==Ratings history==

Although &quot;Loving&quot; had low ratings throughout its history, its first few years were relatively encouraging. In its debut year (1983), it finished in 11th place and 3.9, above the then ailing soaps &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. 1984 saw the show&#x27;s ratings climb to a fairly comfortable 10th place and 4.1, holding that position for the 1985-1986 television season with 4.2. A change in timeslot, with &quot;Loving&quot; occupying the slot previously held by &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, was a major factor in ratings improvement (albeit having the opposite effect on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;).

The slow but steady ratings growth was not sustained in the long run. &quot;Loving&quot; fell back to 11th place, hitting last place for the first time, in early 1989 (between the January series finale of &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; and the March premiere of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Generations&quot;). In 1990, the show ranked 11th place as well. After &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; went off the air on January 15, 1993, &quot;Loving&quot;, according to television historian Alex McNeil, &quot;was consistently the lowest rated of the ten network daytime soaps.&quot;

When it originally premiered, the show aired at 11:30 ET/10:30 CT/MT/PT. On October 8, 1984, the show was moved to the later 12:30 /11:30 timeslot, bumping &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; up to Noon/11:00. This caused &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; ratings to plummet because many East Coast ABC stations pre-empted network programming at Noon for local news. Some affiliates, such as WSB-TV in Atlanta, chose to keep &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; at 12:30, not airing &quot;Loving&quot; until after &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; cancellation in 1989. Despite airing in the 12:30 timeslot, &quot;Loving&quot; never achieved the ratings &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; had during its glory years. In the Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones, &quot;Loving&quot; was often pre-empted at 11:30 for local newscasts, airing on a one-day delay earlier in the morning or not at all.

On August 17, 1992, ABC officially stopped programming the Noon/11:00am CT timeslot. &quot;Loving&quot; was then made available to affiliates at Noon/11 or 12:30/11:30. Some affiliates in the Central and Pacific Time Zones moved &quot;Loving&quot; to 11:00 AM to air local newscasts at 11:30. Despite the time slot changes on some affiliates, the national ratings for the show never improved. In fact, the show&#x27;s national ratings were never strong enough to climb above tenth place. However, &quot;Loving&quot; did beat the genre&#x27;s top-rated program, CBS&#x27; &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, in markets such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia, which were home to four of ABC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations, despite only competing with the first half hour of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

The show had a short two-year run in the early years of UK satellite and cable channel Sky One, starting in February 1989. &quot;Loving&quot; aired in an afternoon slot, Monday to Friday at 14:45, later moved to 14:30, before being cancelled and replaced by &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in February 1991.

<text>Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser (22 January 1855, Schweidnitz – 30 July 1916, Breslau) was a German physician who discovered the causative agent (pathogen) of gonorrhea, a strain of bacteria that was named in his honour (&quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;).

== Life and career ==
Neisser was born in the Silesian town of Schweidnitz (now Świdnica, in Poland), the son of a well-known Jewish physician, Moritz Neisser. After he completed the elementary school in Münsterberg, Neisser enrolled in the St. Maria Magdalena School in Breslau (now Wrocław, in Poland). In this school, he was a contemporary of another great name in the history of medicine, Paul Ehrlich. He obtained the Abitur in 1872.

Neisser began to study medicine at the University of Breslau, but later moved to Erlangen, completing his studies in 1877. Initially Neisser wanted to be an internist, but did not find a suitable place. He found work, however as an assistant of the dermatologist Oskar Simon (1845–1892), concentrating on sexually transmitted diseases and leprosy. During the following two years he studied and obtained experimental evidence about the pathogen for gonorrhea, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;.

Neisser was also the co-discoverer of the causative agent of leprosy. In 1879 the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen gave to young Neisser (who had visited him in Norway to examine some 100 leprosy patients) some tissue samples of his patients. Neisser successfully stained the bacteria and announced his findings in 1880, claiming to have discovered the pathogenesis of leprosy. There was some conflict between Neisser and Hansen, because Hansen had failed to culture the organism and demonstrate unequivocally its link to leprosy, although he had observed the bacterium since 1872.

In 1882 Neisser was appointed professor extraordinarius by the University at the age of 29, and worked as a dermatologist in the university hospital of Breslau. Later he was promoted to the head of the hospital. In the following year he married Toni Neisser, née Kauffmann.

In 1898 Albert Neisser published clinical trials on serum therapy in patients with syphilis. He injected cell free serum from patients with syphilis into patients who were admitted for other medical conditions. Most of these patients were prostitutes, who were neither informed about the experiment nor asked for their consent. When some of them contracted syphilis Neisser argued that the women did not contract syphilis as a result of his serum injections but contracted the disease because they worked as prostitutes. Though the majority of his contemporary academic physicians supported him, Neisser was investigated by the Prussian public prosecutor and ultimately fined for failing to obtain consent.

In 1905 and 1906 Neisser travelled to Java, in order to study the possible transmission of syphilis from apes to humans. He later cooperated with August Paul von Wassermann (1866–1925) to develop the famous diagnostic test for detecting &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; infections, and also in the testing of the first chemotherapeutic agent for syphilis, Salvarsan, which was discovered by his former school fellow Paul Ehrlich in 1910. In 1907, Neisser was promoted to professor ordinarius of dermatology and sexually transmitted diseases at Breslau.

As a scientific leader, Neisser was also very active. In the field of public health, he promoted vigorously preventive and educational measures to the public, and the better sanitary control of prostitutes, in order to combat venereal diseases. He was one of the founder of the &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Bekämpfung der Geschlechtskrankheiten&quot; (German Society for the Fight Against Venereal Diseases) in 1902, and of the Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (German Dermatological Society) in 1888.

Neisser died of sepsis on 30 July 1916, at the age of 61 years, in Breslau.

==Albert Neisser Lectureship==
The Albert Neisser Lectureship has been awarded since 2005 by the Department of Dermatology at the University of Wrocław to dermatologists who have made significant clinical and research contributions to the field. Past awardees include:

<text>Lines per inch (LPI) is a measurement of printing resolution. A line consists of halftones that is built up by physical ink dots made by the printer device to create different tones. Specifically LPI is a measure of how close together the lines in a halftone grid are. The quality of printer device or screen determines how high the LPI will be. High LPI indicates greater detail and sharpness.

Printed magazines and newspapers often use a halftone system. Typical newsprint paper is not very dense, and has relatively high dot gain or color bleeding, so newsprint is usually around 85 LPI. Higher-quality paper, such as that used in commercial magazines, has less dot gain, and can range up to 300 LPI with quality glossy (coated) paper.

In order to effectively utilize the entire range of available LPI in a halftone system, an image selected for printing generally must have 1.5 to 2 times as many samples per inch (SPI). For instance, if the target output device is capable of printing at 100 LPI, an optimal range for a source image would be 150 to 200 PI. Using fewer SPI than this would not make full use of the printer&#x27;s available LPI; using more SPI than this would exceed the capability of the printer, and quality would be effectively lost.

Another device that uses the LPI specification is the graphics tablet.

== Conversion to DPI ==
Conversion of the LPI to the DPI is done by simple multiplication:

: 150 LPI x 2 = 300 DPI

== Conversion between Lines per inch and Lines per cm ==

Countries using the metric system tend to use lines per centimeter (L/cm).

In order to convert between L/in and L/cm the following formulas can be used:

Lines per inch to lines per cm: L/cm = 0.394 x L/in

i.e. 254 L/in = 100 L/cm

Lines per cm to lines per inch: L/in = 2.54 x L/cm

i.e. 100 L/cm = 254 L/in

<doc id="644779" wikidata="Q852072" url="?curid=644779" title="F-theory">
<text>In theoretical physics, F-theory is a branch of string theory developed by Iranian-American physicist Cumrun Vafa. The new vacua described by F-theory were discovered by Vafa and allowed string theorists to construct new realistic vacua — in the form of F-theory compactified on elliptically fibered Calabi–Yau four-folds. The letter &quot;F&quot; supposedly stands for &quot;Father&quot; in relation to &quot;Mother&quot;-theory.

==Compactifications==
F-theory is formally a 12-dimensional theory, but the only way to obtain an acceptable background is to compactify this theory on a two-torus. By doing so, one obtains type IIB superstring theory in 10 dimensions. The SL(2,Z) S-duality symmetry of the resulting type IIB string theory is manifest because it arises as the group of large diffeomorphisms of the two-dimensional torus.

More generally, one can compactify F-theory on an elliptically fibered manifold (elliptic fibration), i.e. a fiber bundle whose fiber is a two-dimensional torus (also called an elliptic curve). For example, a subclass of the K3 manifolds is elliptically fibered, and F-theory on a K3 manifold is dual to heterotic string theory on a two-torus. Also, the moduli spaces of those theories should be isomorphic.

The large number of semirealistic solutions to string theory referred to as the string theory landscape, with formula_1 elements or so, is dominated by F-theory compactifications on Calabi–Yau four-folds. There are about formula_2 of those solutions consistent with the Standard Model of particle physics.

==Phenomenology==
New models of Grand Unified Theory have recently been developed using F-theory.

==Extra time dimension==
F-theory has the metric signature (10,2), which means that it includes a second time dimension.

<doc id="644781" wikidata="Q302895" url="?curid=644781" title="Michelin Man">
<text>Bibendum (), commonly referred to in English as the Michelin Man or Michelin Tire Man, is the official mascot of the Michelin tire company. A humanoid figure consisting of stacked white tires, it was introduced at the Lyon Exhibition of 1894 where the Michelin brothers had a stand. He is one of the world&#x27;s oldest trademarks still in active use. The slogan &quot;Nunc est bibendum&quot; (&quot;Now is the time to drink&quot;) is taken from Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; (book I, ode xxxvii, line 1). He is also referred to as Bib or Bibelobis.

Michelin dominated the French tire industry for decades and remains a leading international tire manufacturer. Its famous guidebooks are widely used by travelers. Bibendum was depicted visually as a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic exponent of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America&#x27;s superior factory system, but to patriotically excel those factories&#x27; &quot;inferior&quot; products. As automobiles became available to the middle classes, the company&#x27;s advertising followed suit, and its restaurant and hotel guides expanded to a broader range of price categories.

==Development==
While attending the Universal and Colonial Exposition in Lyon in 1894, Édouard and André Michelin noticed a stack of tires that suggested to Édouard the figure of a man without arms. Four years later, André met French cartoonist Marius Rossillon, popularly known as O&#x27;Galop, who showed him a rejected image he had created for a Munich brewery — a large, regal figure holding a huge glass of beer and quoting Horace&#x27;s phrase &quot;Nunc est bibendum&quot; (&quot;Now is the time for drinking&quot;). André immediately suggested replacing the man with a figure made from tires, and O&#x27;Galop adapted the earlier image into Michelin&#x27;s symbol. Today, Bibendum is one of the world&#x27;s most recognized trademarks, representing Michelin in over 170 countries. According to Michelin, a study showed that 90% of the world’s population could instantly recognize him.

The 1898 poster showed him offering the toast to his scrawny Brand X competitors with a glass full of road hazards, with the title and tag (see illustration). The character&#x27;s glass is filled with nails and broken glass, implying that Michelin tires will easily take on road hazards.

The company used this basic poster format for 15 years, adding its latest products to the table in front of the figure. It is unclear when the name &quot;Bibendum&quot; was adopted. At the latest, it was in 1908, when Michelin commissioned Curnonsky to write a newspaper column signed &quot;Bibendum&quot;. In 1922, Michelin held a contest to name the character in the United States.

Rubber tires were originally gray-white, or light or translucent beige. In 1912, they became black when carbon was added to them as a preservative and strengthener. The company changed Bibendum&#x27;s colour to black as well, and featured him that way in several print ads. They decided to abandon the change, citing printing and aesthetic issues (not racial concerns, as is commonly believed).

The image of the plump tire-man is sometimes used to describe an obese person, or someone wearing comically bulky clothing (e.g. &quot;How can I wrap up warmly without looking like the Michelin Man?&quot;).

Bibendum&#x27;s shape has changed over the years. O&#x27;Galop&#x27;s logo was based on bicycle tires, wore pince-nez glasses with lanyard, and smoked a cigar. By the 1960s, Bibendum was shown running, often rolling a tyre as well, and no longer smoked. In 1998, his 100th anniversary, a slimmed-down version of him (sans glasses) was adopted, reflecting the lower-profile, smaller tires of modern cars. An animated version of Bibendum has appeared in American television ads, with a pet puppy similar in appearance to him.

A history of Bibendum, &quot;Le Grand Siècle de Bibendum&quot; (Hoëbeke, Paris, 1997), was written by Olivier Darmon.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Bibendum chair&quot; was designed by Eileen Gray in 1925.

Cayce Pollard, the main character of William Gibson&#x27;s novel &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;, has a strong aversion to corporate brands and logos. The sight of Bibendum in particular gives her panic attacks.

Bibendum made a brief guest appearance in the Asterix series, as the chariot-wheel dealer in certain translations, including the English one, of &quot;Asterix in Switzerland&quot;. (The original French version used the Gaulish warrior mascot of French service-station company Antar.)

The mascot appears in a BBC &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; comedy sketch, in which a restaurant waiter, and chef suspect a diner, dressed as Bibendum, might be a food critic for the Michelin Guide.

Michelin sued the performance artist Momus in 1991 for releasing a song about the trademarked Michelin Man. The song, simply titled &quot;Michelin Man&quot;, was released the same year as the third track on his album &quot;Hippopotamomus&quot; (which also had a hippopotamus-headed version of the Michelin Man on its cover) used the mascot as a metaphor for hypersexual rubber fetishism. The use of the Michelin Man in such explicit lyrics were not authorized by the Michelin company, and Momus was sued by the company for depicting their mascot in scenarios of a pornographic nature. As a result, all remaining copies of the album were destroyed, the song was removed from subsequent pressings of the album, and the hippo Michelin Man removed from the cover. The 2018 box set &quot;Recreate&quot; (containing some of Momus&#x27; albums, including the Hippopotamomus album that caused the lawsuit over his song) restored the track to the album, and came with a booklet by Anthony Reynolds titled &#x27;Sons of Pioneers&#x27;, mentioning the lawsuit but not explaining why the track was reinstated.

French reggae band Tryo sang about Bibendum on their album &quot;Grain de Sable&quot;. (&#x27;Mr. Bibendum, he is truly enormous, Mr. Bibendum; happiness personified&#x27;).

In the 2009 animated, Academy Award-winning satire &quot;Logorama&quot;, a series of Bibendums play police detectives, a sheriff, and a squad of SWAT personnel who all work together to try to bring down a psychotic, ultraviolent criminal played by Ronald McDonald.

In the French dubbed version of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is named &quot;Bibendum Chamallow&quot;. (&quot;Chamallow&quot; was originally a confectionery marketed in France under this name, which vaguely resembles the American marshmallow.) 

In the Australian Army Training Establishment at Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra, one of the five training companies, Gallipoli Company, uses the Michelin Man as its mascot. The reasons behind this involve an officer candidate who was sent to Turkey for a commemoration of World War One, and told to bring back a meaningful souvenir, but after heavy alcohol consumption instead stole the Michelin Man from the local garage.

<text>Charlene L. Tilton (born December 1, 1958) is an American actress and singer. She is widely known for playing Lucy Ewing on the CBS prime time soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;.

==Career==
Tilton had early roles on television series such as &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;. She made her first film appearance alongside Jodie Foster in &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (1976). In 1978, Tilton made a cameo appearance in the John Milius film &quot;Big Wednesday&quot;. The same year, she made her big break by landing the role of Lucy Ewing, the sly, vixenish, frequently frustrated granddaughter of John &quot;Jock&quot; Ewing Sr. and the former Eleanor &quot;Ellie&quot; Southworth (and out-of-wedlock daughter of Gary and Valene Ewing on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;) on the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, alongside actors Jim Davis, Barbara Bel Geddes, and Larry Hagman, from 1978 to 1985 and from 1988 to 1990. She also appeared on one episode of the series&#x27; spin-off &quot;Knots Landing&quot; in 1980. At the height of her &quot;Dallas&quot; fame, she received a $50,000 salary per episode, appeared on 500 magazine covers, and drew 65 million viewers for her 1981 TV wedding.

Tilton is also a singer, lending her vocal ability to a 1978 episode of &quot;Dallas&quot; titled &quot;Runaway&quot;, in which Greg Evigan guest-starred. In 1984, she released the dance-pop single &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot;, which became a hit in several European countries, though not in the United States. She appeared on &quot;Circus of the Stars&quot; in 1979 and 1991, on one occasion acting as a knife thrower&#x27;s target girl while dressed in a gold bikini. Tilton also appeared on game shows, such as &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Pyramid&quot;, &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;, and &quot;Catch 21&quot; including being a panelist on the 1979–1982 syndicated version of &quot;Match Game&quot;. She also hosted the unsold pilot for a potential revival of the show in syndication as &quot;MG2&quot; in 1996. After her breakthrough with &quot;Dallas&quot;, Tilton went to star in the television films &quot;Diary of a Teenage Hitchhiker&quot; and &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; both released in 1979. During the 1980s, she guest-starred on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

Tilton was the guest host on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 21, 1981, which featured a parody of the famed &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; episode of &quot;Dallas&quot;. In the episode, cast member Charles Rocket was shot in the chest by a sniper while doing a sketch about a sexy couple (with Gail Matthius as his partner) bathing a dog and spouting innuendo. At the end of the show, during the &quot;goodbyes&quot;, Tilton asked Rocket how he felt about being shot. In character, Rocket improvised, &quot;Oh, man, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever been shot in my life. I&#x27;d like to know who fucking did it.&quot; The improvisation by Rocket, which violated FCC broadcast standards, led to his dismissal from the show&#x27;s cast. 

After &quot;Dallas&quot;, Tilton appeared in the 1990 western film &quot;Border Shootout&quot; starring Glenn Ford, and the following year had supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;. She appeared in a number of commercials for the Abdominizer line of direct-market workout equipment in the 1990s. In 1993, she appeared as herself in an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; titled &quot;Tis Time to Smell the Roses&quot;, which sent up her involvement with the Abdominizer. In addition, she has appeared in several send-up comedies, such as &quot;The Silence of the Hams&quot; (1994), &quot;Superhero Movie&quot; (2008), and &quot;Paranormal Calamity&quot; (2010). In 2005, she appeared in the British reality television show &quot;The Farm&quot;.

In 2001, Tilton was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award for her role as Lucy Ewing on the original &quot;Dallas&quot; television series. In January 2012, Tilton was a contestant on the British ice-skating show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in its seventh season, in which she was paired with American figure skater Matthew Gonzalez. Tilton was voted out of the competition, though, in week five of a 12-week run.

In 2012, Tilton joined the cast of TNT&#x27;s &quot;Dallas&quot; revival series, and reprised her role as Lucy Ewing in a number of episodes. She later appeared in the ABC comedy series &quot;The Middle&quot; in 2015, and the thriller film &quot;&quot;. Tilton also appeared in a number of Lifetime and Hallmark Channel films in later years.

==Personal life==
Tilton was born in San Diego, California, the daughter of Katherine Thacker, a secretary. 

Tilton was married to country singer Johnny Lee from 1982 to 1984. Their daughter, Cherish Lee, was born in 1982. In 2001, Tilton began dating cinematographer Cheddy Hart. The couple enjoyed boating and lived together in a modest home in Oxnard, California. In December 2009, Hart suddenly died of heart failure at age 54. 

Tilton is a strong advocate for autism awareness in the media. She is currently the ambassador for Actors for Autism, an organization that leads improv and acting workshops for children and adults with autism. She approached AFA in 2010 with the desire to volunteer and has been affiliated with them ever since.

==Friendship with Larry Hagman==
While in high school, the young unknown actress met Larry Hagman, whom she regarded as a surrogate father. Then, a few years later, at age 17, she auditioned and won the role of Hagman&#x27;s confused niece, Lucy Ewing, on &quot;Dallas&quot;. The two had a remarkable on- and off-screen chemistry, for the show&#x27;s first eight seasons, and they also danced together, off camera. She left the show at the end of the eighth season, her contract having expired; Larry Hagman was very disappointed over her departure. She said of Hagman in 1988, &quot;He called me and said, &#x27;You&#x27;re certainly a good actress, we never realized.&#x27; I think Larry went to bat for me to come back on the show.&quot; That same year, she came back to the show, and stayed on for two more seasons, until her departure in 1990, a year before the series finale. After &quot;Dallas&quot;, Tilton remained on good terms with Hagman, and cared deeply about her TV uncle&#x27;s failing health. In 1995, Hagman was diagnosed with liver cancer and needed a liver transplant; he later received a transplant and survived the bout with cancer. She did not appear in any of the &quot;Dallas&quot; TV reunion movies, but in 2004, appeared in &quot;Dallas Reunion: The Return to Southfork.&quot; 

In September 2001, she was the only &quot;Dallas&quot; cast member to attend Larry Hagman&#x27;s 70th birthday. Eleven years later, she was reunited with Hagman for the last time to star in the second incarnation of &quot;Dallas&quot;. When Hagman died on November 23, 2012, due to complications from myelodysplastic syndrome, she was devastated, and attended his funeral. Upon his death, Tilton released a statement: &quot;At seventeen years old, my life took a turn that one could only dream of. I was cast as Lucy Ewing in the iconic show &quot;Dallas&quot;. &quot;Dallas&quot; was so much more than a television phenomenon to me. It was my family. I grew up with a mentally ill single mother raising me and no father figure in my life. I lived on my own in an apartment from the age of 15. I remember the day I met the force of nature that is Larry Hagman like it was yesterday. My Uncle Larry became the father figure that I so needed and longed for. He taught me how to be professional, work hard, but have fun at the same time, and how to respect the opportunities I was blessed to have been given. He was very protective because I was so young, but also expected the best from me on the set of &quot;Dallas&quot;. He was one of the best actors the world has ever known. To me, he will always be my Uncle Larry. I am so so very sad, but cherish the lifetime of memories I have with him.&quot;

<text>Joseph Peter Mascolo (March 13, 1929 – December 8, 2016) was an American musician and dramatic actor. During his long career, he acted in numerous motion pictures and television series. He played villain Stefano DiMera on NBC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1982 to 2016. He also starred as Massimo Marone on the CBS&#x27; soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; from 2001 to 2006.

== Early life ==
Mascolo was born on March 13, 1929, and raised in West Hartford, Connecticut. His parents, Anna Mascolo (née DeTuccio; 1910–2010) and Peter Mascolo (1901–2008), were immigrants from Naples, Italy, and had their 80th wedding anniversary shortly before his father died. Mascolo had one sister, Marie LaVoie. He attended the United States Military Academy after graduating high school. Mascolo attended the University of Miami. To support himself financially, he studied acting under famed acting coach Stella Adler in New York City. He originally was trained in classical music and opera.

== Career ==

Mascolo&#x27;s first film appearance was in 1968&#x27;s &quot;Hot Spur&quot; as Carlo. He was in 1972&#x27;s neo-noir action crime–drama film &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score!&quot; as Gus Mascola. Mascolo was in 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Spook Who Sat by the Door&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Jaws 2&quot; as Len Peterson. He was in 1981&#x27;s &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; as JoJo Tipps and 1982&#x27;s &quot;Yes, Giorgio&quot; Mascolo&#x27;s last film appearance was in 1986&#x27;s &quot;Heat&quot; as Baby.

=== Television ===
Mascolo was best known in the recurring role of Stefano DiMera on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1982 to 1985, returning briefly in 1988, again from 1993 to 2001, and making appearances again since 2007 until Stefano&#x27;s death in 2016, making his final appearance on February 9, 2017, airing 2 months after his death, and won three Soap Opera Digest Awards. He has also played a wide range of roles on many different series including (but not limited to) a Stefano-like villain named Nicholas Van Buren on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and Carlos Alvarez on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. Before achieving his fame, he was seen in the earlier soap operas &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; and &quot;From These Roots&quot;. He also made primetime television appearances on &quot;All in the Family,&quot; &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot; and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;.

Mascolo portrayed Massimo Marone on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; beginning August 2001. He decided not to renew his contract with the show in July 2006, due to a lack of storyline and decided to return to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, where his character Stefano DiMera was resurrected after six years.

Mascolo also appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; in October 1979, as Mr. Arnold in the episode &quot;Brain Child&quot;. 10 years later, he would appear again in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot;, as Albert G. Tendelli, a police confidant of Daredevil.
He also appeared in an episode of Hart to Hart on 1/3/84 as villain Mr. Rhodes.

== Personal life and death ==
Mascolo married Rose Maimone in 1953. They had a son named Peter. Maimone died in 1986. In 2005, Mascolo married his second wife, Patricia Schultz. In January 2016, he told &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; that he had suffered a stroke in the spring of 2015. &quot;During my rehab, I thought this would be a good time for Stefano to leave.&quot;

Mascolo died on December 8, 2016, in Santa Clarita, California at 87 after years of battling Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

<doc id="644792" wikidata="Q1141272" url="?curid=644792" title="Kamet">
<text>Kamet () is the second-highest mountain in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India, after Nanda Devi. It is the 29th highest mountain in the world. It lies in the Chamoli District of Uttarakhand.
Its appearance resembles a giant pyramid topped by a flat summit area with two peaks.

==Climbing==
Due to its position near the Tibetan Plateau, Kamet is very remote and not as accessible as some Himalayan peaks. It also receives a great deal of wind from the Plateau. However, by modern standards, it is a relatively straightforward ascent for such a high mountain. Early explorers of the region faced long approach marches of around from Ranikhet through dense mountain forest; access is easier today.

While attempts to climb Kamet began in 1855, the first ascent was not made until 1931 by Frank Smythe, Eric Shipton, R.L. Holdsworth, Raymond Greene, the expedition&#x27;s doctor, Bill Birnie and Lewa Sherpa, members of a British expedition. Kamet was the first peak over to be climbed, and was the highest summit reached until the first ascent of Nanda Devi five years later. However, far higher non-summit altitudes had been reached on the north side of Mount Everest in the 1920s.

The standard route begins from the East Kamet (or Purbi Kamet) Glacier, ascending via Meade&#x27;s Col (c. 7,100m/23,300 ft), the saddle between Kamet and its northern outlier Abi Gamin. From Meade&#x27;s Col the route ascends the northeast edge of the north face. The ascent to Meade&#x27;s col involves steep gullies, a rock wall, and several glacier climbs. Five camps are usually placed en route. The final ascent to the summit involves steep snow, possibly icy.

==Neighboring and subsidiary peaks==
Kamet is surrounded by three principal neighboring or subsidiary peaks:
* Mukut Parbat, 7,242 m (23,760 ft) , prominence = 840 m, , northwest of Kamet. First ascent 1951 (see below). The lower of Mukut Parbat&#x27;s twin summit has an elevation of 7,130 m (23,392 ft).
* Abi Gamin, 7,355 m (24,130 ft), prominence = 217 m , north-northeast of Kamet; connected to Kamet by Meade&#x27;s Col. First ascent 1950.
* Mana Peak, 7,272 m (23,858 ft) , prominence = 720 m, , south-southeast of Kamet. First ascent 1937.

Several adjoining peaks, such as Mana NW, 7,092 m, Point 6,977 m, Deoban, 6,855 m, and Bidhan Parbat, 6,519 m, also lie close to Kamet.

==Nomenclature==
There are varying explanations of the name &quot;Kamet.&quot; Charles Meade gives the pronunciation as , and claims that it is known to Tibetans as &quot;Kangmen&quot;, signifying &quot;huge grandmother of a sacred snow chain&quot;. However, Frank Smythe writes in his book &quot;Kamet Conquered&quot; that the genesis of the name is from the Tibetan word &quot;Kangmed&quot; (&quot;the lower snows&quot;, from &quot;kang&quot;, &quot;snow&quot;, and &quot;med&quot;, &quot;little&quot;), as distinct from the &quot;higher snows&quot; of the Kailash range, 110 miles east of Kamet. This range is slightly lower than Kamet, its highest peak being Gurla Mandhata, 7,728 m/25,355 ft; however it stands more fully on the high Tibetan Plateau. At dawn and dusk, &quot;the copper colored rock of Mount Kamet reflecting the oblique rays of the sun on its hanging glaciers appears to set these glaciers aglow with crackling flames and bathes the mountain in a red burning glow&quot;. Hence the term &quot;glacier fire&quot; is also used as an allusion to the name Kamet.

==Partial timeline==

* 1848: Richard Strachey determines the height and location of Kamet, as well as the neighboring peaks Abi Gamin, Mukut Parbat, and Mana.
* 1855: German explorers and scientists Adolphe and Robert Schlagintweit, invited by the East India Company to make surveys, travel into Tibet in disguise. After being discovered and arrested, they return, and attempt Abi Gamin from Tibet (via the Abi Gamin Glacier), believing it to be Kamet. (This mistake hampers expeditions until 1912.) They claim to reach a height of 6,785 m (22,260 ft), which is extraordinary for this date.
* 1877: I. S. Pocock of the Survey of India, under E. C. Ryall, accurately surveys Kamet&#x27;s position. However, he supports the inaccurate belief that Abi Gamin is a minor subpeak of Kamet and that a northern route to the summit is practical.
* 1907: Tom Longstaff, Charles Bruce and A. L. Mumm, with alpine guides Alexis and Henri Brocherel, make a preliminary reconnaissance of the eastern and western sides of Kamet. The highest point reached is 6,100 m (20,000 ft) above the East Kamet Glacier. Longstaff deems the East Kamet route as too dangerous due to avalanche risk.
* 1910–1911: Charles Meade, with Alpine guides Alexis Brocherel and Pierre Blanc, and a separate expedition under Alexander Kellas, make a preliminary reconnaissance of the western side of the peak; they explore Khaiam Pass and Glacier.
* 1911: Capt. A. M. Slingsby attempts Kamet on the western side from Ghastoli Glacier (or West Kamet Glacier) via the col on the ridge between Abi Gamin and Mukut Parbat (subsequently named as Slingsby&#x27;s Col, 6,400 m/21,000 ft).
* 1912: Meade, with Alpine guides Franz Lochmatter of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais, Pierre Blanc, Justin Blanc and Jean Perrin, attempts Kamet by Slingsby&#x27;s route, and also later explores the Raikhana glacier system to the east of Kamet. Meade concludes that the East Kamet Glacier is the only practicable route to Kamet&#x27;s summit.
* 1913: Slingsby attempts the same route as in 1911 and reaches 7,000 m (23,000 ft). He later dies in battle in Mesopotamia in 1916.
* 1913: Meade, with Alpine guide Pierre Blanc, attempts Kamet from the eastern side and reaches Meade&#x27;s Col, 7,138 m. (23,420 ft).
* 1914: Kellas makes another reconnaissance of which no records are available, and which is probably abandoned midway due to the commencement of World War I.
* 1920: Kellas and Henry Morshead attempt Meade&#x27;s 1913 route and reach a point slightly above Meade&#x27;s Col.
* 1931: The first ascent of Kamet, detailed above.
* 1937: Frank Smythe returns to the Bhyundar Valley and makes the solo first ascent of Mana on 12 August, through its south ridge from the plateau at the head of the Uttari Naktoni glacier. His companion P.R. Oliver stopped exhausted at 23000&#x27;.
* 1950: An Anglo-Swiss expedition ascends Abi Gamin from its North East ridge.
* 1951: Mukut Parbat is climbed via the steep northwest ridge by a New Zealand team that included Earle Riddiford (leader), Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, Edmund Cotter and Pasang Dawa Lama. Summitters were Riddiford, Cotter and Pasang Dawa Lama.

Summit by three sherpa (Lakpa Sherpa, Migma Sherpa and Dukkpa Sherpa) and three members (Md.Gazali Khan, Santu Biswash and Nandan Prasad Jaiswal &quot; Nandu&quot;).

==Glaciers and rivers==
The West (Pachmi or Paschimi) Kamet Glacier, the East (Purbi or Purva) Kamet Glacier and the Raikana Glacier systems surround Kamet. The branches of the West Kamet Glacier head on the western slopes of Kamet, Abi Gamin, and Mukut Parbat. The East Kamet Glacier flows from the eastern side of Kamet and Mana. The Raikhana glacier originates on the east side of Meade&#x27;s Col saddle, flows east of Abi Gamin, and unites with the East Kamet Glacier. The West Kamet Glacier drains into the Saraswati River while the East Kamet Glacier feeds the Dhauliganga River; both rivers are tributaries of the Alaknanda River, the major river of the Chamoli district.

==High altitude research==
Alexander Kellas and his companion Henry Morshead conducted scientific studies during their 1920 Kamet expedition focusing on the physiology of high altitude travel and acclimatization, and on the possibility of using supplemental oxygen. These studies eventually proved useful on expeditions to Mount Everest.

<text>Suzanne Rogers (born Suzanne Crumpler, July 9, 1943) is an American actress with film and television credits. Her stage name was inspired by Ginger Rogers, whom she cites as a personal inspiration for joining the entertainment industry. Rogers got her start as a dancer/performer at New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall, but she is best known for playing Maggie Horton, a role she originated in 1973 on the NBC/Peacock soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. In her over five-decade run as Maggie, Rogers is the longest-running actor in an American soap opera and plays one of the longest-running character roles in American soap operas.

==Early years==
Suzanne Rogers was born Suzanne Crumpler on July 9, 1943. While growing up in Colonial Heights, Virginia, she took an interest in dancing. She expressed interest in it at the age of two and started taking dancing lessons during her childhood.

==Career==
At the age of 17, Rogers left her hometown and decided to pursue a dancing career. She moved to New York City and became one of the dancers at the Radio City Music Hall. Along with becoming a Rockette, Rogers performed in several Broadway musicals including &quot;Coco&quot;, &quot;Hallelujah Baby&quot; and &quot;Follies&quot;, distinctly heard on the original cast album and mentioned in the book &quot;Everything Was Possible&quot; which covered the creation and history of the hit Broadway show. After spending 10 years in New York City, the actress wanted to try out an acting dream and moved to California in January 1973.

She attended acting classes in California with Stella Adler at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting. Soon after, she landed the role of Maggie Horton on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Maggie was introduced as a guest character in August 1973, by scriptwriter William J. Bell and executive producer Betty Corday. From the beginning, Bell considered the role ideal for her. He approached Rogers about taking the role of Maggie, and she agreed. She was immediately described by critics who gave reviews of the show as being one of the most energetic girls on daytime television. The news of Rogers being cast as Maggie was a different move, taking an actress who loves to dance, to a character of a crippled farm girl. This was her first television assignment, after being the youngest girl to take the stage at Radio City Music Hall.

In 1984, Rogers was diagnosed with the rare muscle disorder myasthenia gravis. This disease affected her facial muscles, and the medicine the doctors put her on made her feel ill, and her face appeared swollen while also suffering hair loss. She temporarily left the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse.

Her entire appearance changed, and she did not return to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for a year. Rogers returned to the serial when her health became better. Rogers, wanting to educate viewers about the disease, encouraged executive producer Betty Corday to have her character be diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has myasthenia gravis. The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since. In 2010, after her character&#x27;s husband is killed off, Maggie began to notice some effects she experienced when diagnosed with the disease in 1984.

In 2003, a major series of serial killings occurred on the show. Maggie was &quot;killed off&quot; in a &quot;whodunnit?&quot; murder storyline involving a serial killer. Maggie&#x27;s murder forced Rogers to depart from the series, although she made occasional appearances as Maggie&#x27;s &quot;spirit&quot;, appearing with all of the other victims when the apparent culprit, Marlena Evans, attacked Alice. To help with falling ratings at the time, current head writer James E. Reilly decided to bring all the characters back from the dead. They all turned up in the fictional town of Melaswen, or New Salem spelled backwards. This storyline sparked major controversy, and proved to be a daring move.

Since the death of original cast member Frances Reid (Alice Horton) in 2010, Rogers has been the longest-running actress to appear continuously on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as the new Horton family matriarch.

==Personal life==
Rogers married Sam Groom in 1980. They divorced in 1982.

<text>In the mathematical field of differential geometry, Ricci-flatness is a condition on the curvature of a Riemannian manifold. Ricci-flat manifolds are a special kind of Einstein manifold. In theoretical physics, Ricci-flat Lorentzian manifolds are of fundamental interest, as they are the solutions of Einstein&#x27;s field equations in a vacuum with vanishing cosmological constant.

In Lorentzian geometry, a number of Ricci-flat metrics are known from works of Karl Schwarzschild, Roy Kerr, and Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat. In Riemannian geometry, Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s resolution of the Calabi conjecture produced a number of Ricci-flat metrics on Kähler manifolds.

==Definition==
A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is said to be Ricci-flat if its Ricci curvature is zero. It is direct to verify that, except in dimension two, a metric is Ricci-flat if and only if its Einstein tensor is zero. Ricci-flat manifolds are one of three special types of Einstein manifold, arising as the special case of scalar curvature equaling zero.

From the definition of the Weyl curvature tensor, it is direct to see that any Ricci-flat metric has Weyl curvature equal to Riemann curvature tensor. By taking traces, it is straightforward to see that the converse also holds. This may also be phrased as saying that Ricci-flatness is characterized by the vanishing of the two non-Weyl parts of the Ricci decomposition.

Since the Weyl curvature vanishes in two or three dimensions, every Ricci-flat metric in these dimensions is flat. Conversely, it is automatic from the definitions that any flat metric is Ricci-flat. The study of flat metrics is usually considered as a topic unto itself. As such, the study of Ricci-flat metrics is only a distinct topic in dimension four and above.

==Examples==
As noted above, any flat metric is Ricci-flat. However it is nontrivial to identify Ricci-flat manifolds whose full curvature is nonzero.

In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the Schwarzschild metrics, which are Ricci-flat Lorentzian manifolds of nonzero curvature. Roy Kerr later found the Kerr metrics, a two-parameter family containing the Schwarzschild metrics as a special case. These metrics are fully explicit and are of fundamental interest in the mathematics and physics of black holes. More generally, in general relativity, Ricci-flat Lorentzian manifolds represent the vacuum solutions of Einstein&#x27;s field equations with vanishing cosmological constant.

Many pseudo-Riemannian manifolds are constructed as homogeneous spaces. However, these constructions are not directly helpful for Ricci-flat Riemannian metrics, in the sense that any homogeneous Riemannian manifold which is Ricci-flat must be flat. However, there are homogeneous (and even symmetric) Lorentzian manifolds which are Ricci-flat but not flat, as follows from an explicit construction and computation of Lie algebras.

Until Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s resolution of the Calabi conjecture in the 1970s, it was not known whether every Ricci-flat Riemannian metric on a closed manifold is flat. His work, using techniques of partial differential equations, established a comprehensive existence theory for Ricci-flat metrics in the special case of Kähler metrics on closed complex manifolds. Due to his analytical techniques, the metrics are non-explicit even in the simplest cases. Such Riemannian manifolds are often called Calabi–Yau manifolds, although various authors use this name in slightly different ways.

==Analytical character==
Relative to harmonic coordinates, the condition of Ricci-flatness for a Riemannian metric can be interpreted as a system of elliptic partial differential equations. It is a straightforward consequence of standard &quot;elliptic regularity&quot; results that any Ricci-flat Riemannian metric on a smooth manifold is analytic, in the sense that harmonic coordinates define a compatible analytic structure, and the local representation of the metric is real-analytic. This also holds in the broader setting of Einstein Riemannian metrics.

Analogously, relative to harmonic coordinates, Ricci-flatness of a Lorentzian metric can be interpreted as a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. Based on this perspective, Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat developed the well-posedness of the Ricci-flatness condition. She reached a definitive result in collaboration with Robert Geroch in the 1960s, establishing how a certain class of &quot;maximally extended&quot; Ricci-flat Lorentzian metrics are prescribed and constructed by certain Riemannian data. These are known as &quot;maximal globally hyperbolic developments&quot;. In general relativity, this is typically interpreted as an initial value formulation of Einstein&#x27;s field equations for gravitation.

The study of Ricci-flatness in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases are quite distinct. This is already indicated by the fundamental distinction between the geodesically complete metrics which are typical of Riemannian geometry and the maximal globally hyperbolic developments which arise from Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch&#x27;s work. Moreover, the analyticity and corresponding unique continuation of a Ricci-flat Riemannian metric has a fundamentally different character than Ricci-flat Lorentzian metrics, which have finite speeds of propagation and fully localizable phenomena. This can be viewed as a nonlinear geometric analogue of the difference between the Laplace equation and the wave equation.

==Topology of Ricci-flat Riemannian manifolds==
Yau&#x27;s existence theorem for Ricci-flat Kähler metrics established the precise topological condition under which such a metric exists on a given closed complex manifold: the first Chern class of the holomorphic tangent bundle must be zero. The necessity of this condition was previously known by Chern–Weil theory.

Beyond Kähler geometry, the situation is not as well understood. A four-dimensional closed and oriented manifold supporting any Einstein Riemannian metric must satisfy the Hitchin–Thorpe inequality on its topological data. As particular cases of well-known theorems on Riemannian manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature, any manifold with a complete Ricci-flat Riemannian metric must:
* have first Betti number less than or equal to the dimension, whenever the manifold is closed
* have fundamental group of polynomial growth.
Mikhael Gromov and Blaine Lawson introduced the notion of &quot;enlargeability&quot; of a closed manifold. The class of enlargeable manifolds is closed under homotopy equivalence, the taking of products, and under the connected sum with an arbitrary closed manifold. Every Ricci-flat Riemannian manifold in this class is flat, which is a corollary of Cheeger and Gromoll&#x27;s splitting theorem.

==Ricci-flatness and holonomy==
On a simply-connected Kähler manifold, a Kähler metric is Ricci-flat if and only if the holonomy group is contained in the special unitary group. On a general Kähler manifold, the &quot;if&quot; direction still holds, but only the &quot;restricted&quot; holonomy group of a Ricci-flat Kähler metric is necessarily contained in the special unitary group.

A hyperkähler manifold is a Riemannian manifold whose holonomy group is contained in the symplectic group. This condition on a Riemannian manifold may also be characterized (roughly speaking) by the existence of a 2-sphere of complex structures which are all parallel. This says in particular that every hyperkähler metric is Kähler; furthermore, via the Ambrose–Singer theorem, every such metric is Ricci-flat. The Calabi–Yau theorem specializes to this context, giving a general existence and uniqueness theorem for hyperkähler metrics on compact Kähler manifolds admitting holomorphically symplectic structures. Examples of hyperkähler metrics on noncompact spaces had earlier been obtained by Eugenio Calabi. The Eguchi–Hanson space, discovered at the same time, is a special case of his construction.

A quaternion-Kähler manifold is a Riemannian manifold whose holonomy group is contained in the Lie group . Marcel Berger showed that any such metric must be Einstein. Furthermore, any Ricci-flat quaternion-Kähler manifold must be &quot;locally&quot; hyperkähler, meaning that the &quot;restricted&quot; holonomy group is contained in the symplectic group.

A manifold or manifold is a Riemannian manifold whose holonomy group is contained in the Lie groups  or . The Ambrose–Singer theorem implies that any such manifold is Ricci-flat. The existence of closed manifolds of this type was established by Dominic Joyce in the 1990s.

Marcel Berger commented that all known examples of irreducible Ricci-flat Riemannian metrics on simply-connected closed manifolds have special holonomy groups, according to the above possibilities. It is not known whether this suggests an unknown general theorem or simply a limitation of known techniques. For this reason, Berger considered Ricci-flat manifolds to be &quot;extremely mysterious.&quot;

<text>In differential geometry and mathematical physics, an Einstein manifold is a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian differentiable manifold whose Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric. They are named after Albert Einstein because this condition is equivalent to saying that the metric is a solution of the vacuum Einstein field equations (with cosmological constant), although both the dimension and the signature of the metric can be arbitrary, thus not being restricted to Lorentzian manifolds (including the four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds usually studied in general relativity). Einstein manifolds in four Euclidean dimensions are studied as gravitational instantons.

If formula_1 is the underlying formula_2-dimensional manifold, and formula_3 is its metric tensor, the Einstein condition means that

:formula_4

for some constant formula_5, where formula_6 denotes the Ricci tensor of formula_3. Einstein manifolds with formula_8 are called Ricci-flat manifolds.

==The Einstein condition and Einstein&#x27;s equation==

In local coordinates the condition that formula_9 be an Einstein manifold is simply

:formula_10

Taking the trace of both sides reveals that the constant of proportionality formula_5 for Einstein manifolds is related to the scalar curvature formula_12 by

:formula_13

where formula_2 is the dimension of formula_1.

In general relativity, Einstein&#x27;s equation with a cosmological constant formula_16 is

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the Einstein gravitational constant. The stress–energy tensor formula_19 gives the matter and energy content of the underlying spacetime. In vacuum (a region of spacetime devoid of matter) formula_20, and Einstein&#x27;s equation can be rewritten in the form (assuming that formula_21):
:formula_22
Therefore, vacuum solutions of Einstein&#x27;s equation are (Lorentzian) Einstein manifolds with formula_5 proportional to the cosmological constant.

== Examples ==

Simple examples of Einstein manifolds include:
* All 2D manifolds admit Einstein metrics. In fact, in this dimension, a metric is Einstein if and only if it has constant Gauss curvature. The classical uniformization theorem for Riemann surfaces guarantees that there is such a metric in every conformal class on any 2-manifold. 
*Any manifold with constant sectional curvature is an Einstein manifold—in particular:
** Euclidean space, which is flat, is a simple example of Ricci-flat, hence Einstein metric.
** The &quot;n&quot;-sphere, formula_24, with the round metric is Einstein with formula_25.
** Hyperbolic space with the canonical metric is Einstein with formula_26.
* Complex projective space, formula_27, with the Fubini–Study metric, have formula_28
* Calabi–Yau manifolds admit an Einstein metric that is also Kähler, with Einstein constant formula_29. Such metrics are not unique, but rather come in families; there is a Calabi–Yau metric in every Kähler class, and the metric also depends on the choice of complex structure. For example, there is a 60-parameter family of such metrics on K3, 57 parameters of which give rise to Einstein metrics which are not related by isometries or rescalings.
* Kähler–Einstein metrics exist on a variety of compact complex manifolds due to the existence results of Shing-Tung Yau, and the later study of K-stability especially in the case of Fano manifolds. 
* Irreducible symmetric spaces, as classified by Elie Cartan, are always Einstein. Among these spaces, the compact ones all have positive Einstein constant formula_5. Examples of these include the Grassmannians formula_31, formula_32, and formula_33. Every such compact space has a so-called non-compact dual, which instead has negative Einstein constant formula_5. These dual pairs are related in manner that is exactly parallel to the relationship between spheres and hyperbolic spaces.

One necessary condition for closed, oriented, 4-manifolds to be Einstein is satisfying the Hitchin–Thorpe inequality. However, this necessary condition is very far from sufficient, as further obstructions have been discovered by 
LeBrun, Sambusetti, and others.

==Applications==

Four dimensional Riemannian Einstein manifolds are also important in mathematical physics as gravitational instantons in quantum theories of gravity. The term &quot;gravitational instanton&quot; is sometimes restricted to Einstein 4-manifolds whose Weyl tensor is anti-self-dual, and it is very often assumed that the metric is asymptotic to the standard metric on a finite quotient Euclidean 4-space (and are therefore complete but non-compact). In differential geometry, simply connected self-dual Einstein 4-manifolds are coincide with the 4-dimensional, reverse-oriented hyperkähler manifolds in the Ricci-flat case, but are sometimes called quaternion Kähler manifolds otherwise.

Higher-dimensional Lorentzian Einstein manifolds are used in modern theories of gravity, such as string theory, M-theory and supergravity. Hyperkähler and quaternion Kähler manifolds (which are special kinds of Einstein manifolds) also have applications in physics as target spaces for nonlinear σ-models with supersymmetry.

Compact Einstein manifolds have been much studied in differential geometry, and many examples are known, although constructing them is often challenging. Compact Ricci-flat manifolds are particularly difficult to find: in the monograph on the subject by the pseudonymous author Arthur Besse, readers are offered a meal in a starred restaurant in exchange for a new example.

<text>Cynthia Cristina Ferrare (born 1950) is an American fashion model, actress, author and talk-show host. She had lead roles in several films in the late-1960s and early-1970s, including the 1968 comedy &quot;The Impossible Years&quot; and the 1972 Western film &quot;J. W. Coop&quot;, as well as portraying the titular character in Juan López Moctezuma&#x27;s horror film &quot;Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary&quot; (also 1972).

In the 1980s, Ferrare transitioned from acting to hosting several television series, including &quot;The Home Show&quot;, &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot;, and &quot;Big Bowl of Love&quot; on the Oprah Winfrey Network. She has also authored several non-fiction cooking and self-help books.

==Early life==
Ferrare was born in 1950 in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of Renata and Tavio Ferrare, a butcher. Her family is of Italian descent. She was 14 years old when her family moved to Los Angeles, California, where her beauty landed her a contract with Nina Blanchard&#x27;s modeling agency. When she was 16, she signed with 20th Century Fox film studios.

==Career==
===Film career and television hosting===

Ferrare made her feature film debut in &quot;The Impossible Years&quot; (1968) opposite David Niven, playing the daughter of a university psychology professor. This was followed by a main role in the Western drama &quot;J. W. Coop&quot; (1972), directed by and starring Cliff Robertson and Geraldine Page. She subsequently starred as the titular character in Juan López Moctezuma&#x27;s horror film &quot;Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary&quot; (1975), portraying a vampire roving a Mexican village.

In 1975, Ferrare worked as the spokesperson for Max Factor.

Ferrare was co-host of &quot;A.M. Los Angeles&quot; on KABC-TV for several years during the late 1980s. She also co-hosted the ABC television series &quot;The Home Show&quot; for several months in early 1989. In 1990, Ferrare was featured in print advertising for Ultra Slim-Fast. She was also a substitute co-host on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;. In 1993, she was guest host for two episodes of &quot;Vicki!&quot;.

From November 1996 – August 1998, Ferrare co-hosted &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; on The Family Channel; the show ended on August 14, 1998, just one day before the channel became Fox Family Channel, which included a major restructuring of the network&#x27;s programing. She later co-hosted a revived version of the show from 2012-2016 with Mark Steines on its new network Hallmark Channel.

Ferrare&#x27;s departure was abrupt and the audience was not given any explanation nor any notice prior to her departure. On June 21, 2016, Hallmark Channel confirmed that Ferrare would no longer co-host the show with Steines; former co-host of &quot;The View&quot; Debbie Matenopoulos was named as her replacement. In a statement via Facebook, Ferrare addressed her exit: &quot;It&#x27;s really very simple, &quot;Home and Family&quot; will have a season 5 which I am so happy for and the Network decided that they want a new co-host and that will be Debbie. She will do a great job!&quot;

===Designing===
She and her mother created the Cristina Ferrare Collection, producing jewelry that, in 2002, was sold in seven Neiman Marcus stores and was &quot;beginning to pop up in specialty shops throughout the country.&quot;

===&quot;Big Bowl of Love&quot;===
Ferrare premiered in her new show &quot;Big Bowl of Love&quot; on Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s network (OWN) on January 3, 2011 with &quot;Iron Chef&quot; Cat Cora as the show&#x27;s first guest. &quot;Big Bowl of Love&quot; follows Ferrare cooking recipes alongside her friends, family, and other guests.

==Personal life==
According to Ferrare, in her book &quot;Realistically Ever After&quot;, she married a man in 1969 and annulled it six weeks later. In 1973, she married automobile executive John DeLorean. He had earlier adopted a son Zachary while single, and she also adopted him. Later, they had a daughter, Kathryn. After DeLorean lost his fortune and was accused, then exonerated, of cocaine trafficking charges, Ferrare divorced him in 1985. Two weeks later, on April 21, 1985, she married entertainment industry executive Anthony Thomopoulos.

Ferrare was portrayed by Isabel Arraiza in the 2018 film &quot;Driven&quot; and by Morena Baccarin in the 2019 documentary &quot;Framing John DeLorean&quot;.

Her niece (her sister&#x27;s daughter) is actress Danielle Bisutti.

<doc id="644821" wikidata="Q1030713" url="?curid=644821" title="Another World (TV series)">
<text>Another World is an American television soap opera that aired on NBC from May 4, 1964 to June 25, 1999. It was created by Irna Phillips along with William J. Bell, and was produced by Procter &amp; Gamble Productions at NBC Studios, 1268 East 14th Street in Brooklyn.

Set in the fictional town of Bay City, the series originally opened with announcer Bill Wolff intoning its epigram, &quot;We do not live in this world alone, but in a thousand other worlds,&quot; which Phillips said represented the difference between &quot;the world of events we live in, and the world of feelings and dreams that we strive for.&quot; &quot;Another World&quot; focused less on the conventional drama of domestic life as seen in other soap operas, and more on exotic melodrama between families of different classes and philosophies.

In 1964, &quot;Another World&quot; was the first soap opera to talk about abortion when such subjects were taboo. It was the first soap opera to do a crossover, with the character of Mike Bauer from &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, which was also created by Irna Phillips, coming from Springfield to Bay City. It was also the first to expand to one hour, then to ninety minutes, and then back to an hour. It was the first soap opera to launch two spin-offs, &quot;Somerset&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot;, as well as an indirect one, &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot;, which would be renamed &quot;For Richer, For Poorer&quot;. &quot;Another World&quot; was also the second soap opera with a theme song to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; record charts, &quot;(You Take Me Away To) Another World&quot; by Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris, in 1987.

On April 12, 1999, NBC announced it was canceling &quot;Another World&quot;. Its final episode aired on June 25, 1999. It was replaced with another soap opera, &quot;Passions&quot;, on July 5, 1999.

==Development==
In 1963, NBC approached PGP about Irna Phillips creating a new serial for them. She decided to base it on the concept of living not only in real life, but simultaneously living in an alternate world of hopes and desires. Attorney Mitchell Dru (played by Geoffrey Lumb), who had previously been a character on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, became a character on &quot;Another World&quot; during the early years of the program (1964-1971). Two characters from another CBS soap opera, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;—attorney Mike Bauer and his daughter Hope—did cross over in 1966, remaining for a year before returning to &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;. Expectations were so high that &quot;Another World&quot; had six weeks of commercial time sold in advance.

On November 22, 1963, a group of executives (including Executive producer Allen M. Potter and director Tom Donovan) met at the VMLY&amp;R ad agency in New York to discuss the show&#x27;s opening story, the death of William Matthews, when they heard the news of another death in Dallas: the assassination of President Kennedy.

After opening with a death in the core Matthews family, Irna planned to follow up with an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, a septic abortion, a shooting, and a murder trial. As Allen M. Potter explained, &quot;Irna just didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on waiting for the ratings. She felt that with this kind of showy story she could build an audience more quickly.&quot; Said Tom Donovan, &quot;In construction, Irna was attempting to follow the structure of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Irna would never conceive of a story not based on a family.&quot;

==Cancellation==
On April 12, 1999, as part of a shakeup of the network&#x27;s daytime and early morning schedules (in which NBC also canceled &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot; (with newcomer &quot;Early Today&quot; replacing it as the network&#x27;s early-morning newscast) and picked up the daytime talk show &quot;Later Today&quot; (a short-lived spinoff of &quot;Today&quot;) in exchange for the withdrawal of the talk show &quot;Leeza&quot; (which was renewed for the 1999–2000 season and subsequently sold into first-run syndication) from the network&#x27;s schedule), NBC announced that it would not renew &quot;Another World&quot;, ending the series&#x27; run after 35 years once the show&#x27;s previous renewal agreement ended that June. Many reasons abounded for &quot;Another World&quot; cancellation, with one of the more notable events occurring in the summer of 1998: the network&#x27;s San Francisco affiliate at the time, KRON-TV (now a CW owned-and-operated station) – at the time one of NBC&#x27;s highest-rated stations – stopped airing the show altogether to air the syndicated &quot;Howie Mandel Show&quot; in its timeslot, leaving &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; as the only NBC soap operas that the station cleared on its schedule, and resulting in additional erosion of the program&#x27;s already below-mediocre ratings. Independent station KICU-TV picked up the show and aired it for the rest of its run (with NBC logo bugs and end-credit vocal network promotions removed), but the series still experienced a steep ratings decline in the Bay Area market as KRON refused to guide viewers to the program&#x27;s new home.

==Cast==

==Spin-offs==
The show spawned two spin-offs: &quot;Somerset&quot; (1970–1976) and &quot;Texas&quot; (1980–1982). (In 1970, the two shows were known as &quot;Another World: Bay City&quot; and &quot;Another World: Somerset&quot; before reverting to their unique names.) One primetime special aired in 1992: &quot;Another World: Summer Desire&quot;.

A &quot;viewer-directed,&quot; text-based continuation of the series called &quot;Another World Today&quot; existed online, initially sanctioned by TeleNext Media, the production arm of Procter &amp; Gamble.

==Airtimes==
While individual NBC affiliates had the right to air any show whenever they wished, most of the affiliates (almost all of them, in the earlier days of television) aired the show when it would be transmitted to the network&#x27;s direct affiliates.

On March 5, 1979, the show moved to 90 minutes, making it the first US soap opera to do so. The show moved back to 60 minutes on August 1, 1980.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, when &quot;Another World&quot; was in its final ratings slump, many affiliates swapped &quot;Another World&quot;&#x27;s time slot with &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, which usually aired an hour earlier. Other affiliates transferred &quot;Another World&quot; to their morning schedule. One station, KXAS, aired &quot;Another World&quot; on a different local channel (KXTX) that had a programming and promotion agreement with KXAS, for a time in the late 1990s.

The network aired the show at the following times throughout its history:

*May 4, 1964, to January 3, 1975: 3:00–3:30 PM
*January 6, 1975, to March 2, 1979: 3:00–4:00 PM
*March 5, 1979, to August 1, 1980: 2:30–4:00 PM
*August 4, 1980, to June 25, 1999: 2:00–3:00 PM

==Theme songs==
A number of theme songs were used throughout the run of the series. The most sustained was &quot;(You Take Me Away to) Another World,&quot; which was performed by Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris. The song was used from 1987 to 1996.

Morris&#x27;s and Gayle&#x27;s song was only the second daytime serial theme to become a chart hit; released as a country pop single in 1987, it rose to number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart. (The first was &quot;Nadia&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, which had charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1976.)

<text>Dickson Greeting is an 1891 American short silent film. Directed, produced by, and starring motion-picture pioneer William K. L. Dickson, it displays a 3-second clip of him passing a hat in front of himself, and reaching for it with his other hand. It was filmed on May 20, 1891 in the Photographic Building at Edison&#x27;s Black Maria studio, West Orange, New Jersey, in collaboration with Thomas Edison using his kinetograph. The film was played for viewers at the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, one of the first public presentations of a motion picture.

<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 660, adopted on 2 August 1990, after noting its alarm of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, the council condemned the invasion and demanded Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally to positions as they were on 1 August 1990.

Yemen called upon Iraq and Kuwait to enter into immediate negotiations to resolve their differences, thanking the Arab League for its efforts. Talks between both sides broke down the day before in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The council also decided to meet again as necessary to ensure compliance with the current resolution.

The resolution was adopted by 14 votes to none, while Yemen did not participate in voting. It was the first of twelve resolutions on the conflict passed in 1990.

<doc id="644829" wikidata="Q280768" url="?curid=644829" title="Diocese of Sodor and Man">
<text>The Diocese of Sodor and Man is a diocese of the Church of England. It is one of only two Church of England dioceses not within the United Kingdom (the other is the Diocese in Europe). Originally much larger, today it covers just the Isle of Man and its adjacent islets. Today, the bishop&#x27;s office is in Douglas and the cathedral is in Peel. The diocese is &quot;not&quot; generally called either &quot;Sodor diocese&quot; or &quot;Man diocese&quot;.

==Structure==
The diocese administers 40 churches, which are organised in 15 ecclesiastical parishes. Formerly there were 27 such parishes, but their number has been reduced by extensive pastoral reorganisation between 2012 and 2015. Each parish forms a separate benefice, with the exception of two (Onchan; Lonan and Laxey) which are combined in a team ministry with a team rector and a team vicar. The Archdeacon of Man is the incumbent (vicar) of the parish of St George and All Saints, Douglas.

The Cathedral Church of St German at Peel (informally styled Cathedral Isle of Man) is one of five churches in the parish of the West Coast, the incumbent (vicar) of which is &quot;ex officio&quot; Dean of the Cathedral.

The parishes are grouped into four &quot;Mission Partnerships&quot; (Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern) for purposes of mission and inter-parochial co-operation. Originally informal (from 2010), these mission partnerships became legal entities on 1 January 2013 under the Mission and Pastoral Measure (Isle of Man) 2012. They have completely replaced the traditional rural deanery structure, and the former deaneries and the office of rural dean have been legally abolished. Each mission partnership has a team leader appointed by the bishop from amongst the constituent clergy.

In addition to the parish clergy, the bishop licenses a few ordained chaplains. These include the school chaplain of King William&#x27;s College (where there is an elegant Anglican chapel, with scissor-braced roof with canopied stalls designed by James Cowle), and the hospital chaplain of the island&#x27;s main Noble’s Hospital, where an interdenominational chapel is staffed by the Anglican chaplain together with two colleagues, one Roman Catholic, and one Free Church.

==Early history==
The Norwegian diocese of Sodor was formed in 1154, covering the Hebrides and the other islands along the west coast of Scotland. The name in the original Norse was &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (&quot;Sudreys&quot; or &quot;southern isles&quot;), in contrast to the &quot;Norðreyjar&quot;, the &quot;northern isles&quot; of Orkney and Shetland. The Isle of Man was included in with these southern isles. This diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Nidaros (Trondheim).
Norway controlled all these islands until 1266, when they were ceded to Scotland. The Isle of Man was detached from the Scottish islands and came under the suzerainty of the Kings of England in 1334. Thereafter it was held by feudal Lords of Man (the Stanleys, Earls of Derby, from 1406 to 1736 and the Dukes of Atholl from 1736) until the lordship was purchased by the British Crown in 1765. The right to appoint the Bishop of Sodor and Man belonged to the Lords of Man, and continued to be exercised by the Dukes of Atholl after the revestment in 1765 until it was surrendered to the Crown in 1828. The Isle of Man was never incorporated into the Kingdom of England, or the United Kingdom, but is a Crown Dependency. In common with the rest of the Church of England, at the English Reformation the Diocese left the Roman Catholic Church under Henry VIII. The bishop Thomas Stanley was not a supporter of the reforms (particularly the reallocation of his Diocese from the Province of Canterbury to the Province of York in 1542) and was deprived of office by Henry, but was briefly reinstated under Mary I, who restored Stanley to office, but was separated once again under the religious settlement under Elizabeth I. Since the Isle of Man was not part of the Kingdom of England, the Act of Uniformity 1662 passed at the English Restoration did not apply to it, so Thomas Wilson was free to introduce worship in the Manx language during his episcopate (1697–1755), and to resolve issues of clergy discipline resulting from the Isle of Man&#x27;s unique status.

==Usage of Sodor and Man==
As stated above, the Isle of Man was included in the Southern islands (&quot;Sudreys&quot;); the addition of &quot;and Man&quot; may have been made in the 17th century in ignorance of the proper application of the name of Sodor to the bishopric of Man. It is suggested that St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, being the location of the cathedral for the Norse diocese of Sodor, by some confusion itself became known as Sodor. By the late 16th century the terms &quot;Sodor&quot; and &quot;Man&quot; had become interchangeable, the bishopric being named in legal documents as &quot;Sodor&quot; or &quot;Man&quot; or &quot;Sodor and Man&quot;, or sometimes all three, for the avoidance of doubt (e.g. the grant of the lordship of the Island to the Earl of Derby in 1610 included &quot;the Patronage of the Bishopricke of the said Isle of Mann, and the Patronage of the Bishopricke of Sodor, and the Patronage of the Bishopricke of Sodor and Mann&quot;).

Until 1604 the bishops signed themselves &quot;&quot;Sodorensis&quot;; from 1604 to 1684, sometimes they used &quot;Soderensis&quot;&quot; and sometimes &quot;Sodor and Man&quot;; between 1684 and 2007 all bishops signed &quot;Sodor and Man&quot; or &quot;Sodor and Mann&quot;. However, the present bishop signs &quot;Sodor as Mannin&quot;, the Manx Gaelic equivalent, as did her predecessor.

==Later history==

The original cathedral of the Diocese of Sodor and Man was on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle at Peel. This cathedral fell into disuse during the 18th century and for many years the bishop&#x27;s chapel at Bishopscourt, near Kirk Michael, served as a pro-cathedral. This was a Gothic building, rebuilt in 1814 and again in 1858, and dedicated to St Nicholas. In 1979 Bishopscourt was sold, and the following year the parish church of St German in Peel was designated as &quot;the Cathedral Church of St German&quot; by Act of Tynwald.

An 1836 proposal to subsume the diocese into the Diocese of Carlisle was defeated, as was the 1875 proposal that the Diocese of Liverpool (then at the planning stage, founded 1880) should include the Isle of Man.

Since the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom, the bishop is never a Lord Spiritual and cannot sit in the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. However he is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man. Nevertheless, in common with other Church of England Crown Appointments, the appointment of the bishop is still made on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. However, unlike diocesan bishops in England, who are formally elected by the canons of the cathedral church in accordance with the monarch&#x27;s &quot;congé d&#x27;elire&quot;, the Bishop of Sodor and Man is appointed directly by the monarch by letters patent.

The name of the diocese served as inspiration for the fictional Island of Sodor, the primary setting of Wilbert Awdry&#x27;s &quot;The Railway Series&quot; and the later &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; TV series, which place the island in the Irish Sea.

<text>Santa Barbara is an American television soap opera that aired on NBC from July 30, 1984, to January 15, 1993. The show revolves around the eventful lives of the wealthy Capwell family of Santa Barbara, California. Other prominent families featured on the soap were the rival Lockridge family, and the more modest Andrade and Perkins families.

The serial was produced by Dobson Productions and New World Television, which also served as distributor for the show in international markets. &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; was the first series for New World Television.

&quot;Santa Barbara&quot; aired in the United States at 3:00 PM Eastern (2:00 PM Central) on NBC in the same time slot as &quot;General Hospital&quot; on ABC and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; on CBS and right after &quot;Another World&quot;. &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; aired in over 40 countries around the world. It became the longest-running television series in Russia, airing there from 1992 to 2002. &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; won 24 Daytime Emmy Awards and was nominated 30 times for the same award. The show also won 18 Soap Opera Digest Awards and various other awards.

==Plot==
The original plotline surrounded conflicts between the wealthy Capwell and Lockridge families. Stage legend and Oscar nominee Dame Judith Anderson received a great deal of publicity for headlining the cast as Lockridge matriarch, Minx. John Cory of the New York Times wrote “a good soap opera has plot, plot and more plot” describing the myriad of “dramatic possibilities”, “ideological/societal warfare” and predicting “bitterness along the blue collar versus country club divide.”

A central plot around which many of the others revolve: the murder of Channing Capwell, Jr. which takes place five years before the series begins. Joe Perkins has been jailed for the murder, paroled and returns to Santa Barbara determined to prove his innocence and renew his relationship with Kelly Capwell, sister of the victim.

One controversial storyline involved Eden being brutally raped, and later discovering that her assailant was her gynecologist Zack Kelton, who had examined her after her rape. Zack&#x27;s portrayer, former &quot;Dallas&quot; cast member Leigh McCloskey, stated that he was uncomfortable with the storyline as he felt that women had enough concerns about visiting gynecologists.

In 1988, Libby Slate for the LA Times wrote “Clearly, this is a show that is not afraid to take chances: Roles for deaf performers are a television rarity day or night” 

Over the course of the soap, almost every major character would be accused of the murder of Channing Capwell, Jr. or find his or her life involved in the incident in one way or another: from his illegitimate son to his mysterious, presumed-dead mother.

==Production==
The series was launched on NBC with high promotion on July 30, 1984, while the 1984 Summer Olympics was airing on rival network ABC. However, creators and executive producers Bridget and Jerome Dobson tightened the show&#x27;s cast among a handful of popular characters and proceeded to kill off or write out weaker links and supporting characters via a natural disaster and the &quot;Carnation Killer&quot; serial killer storyline. When the Lockridges staged a comeback in the early 1990s, the much younger Broadway and movie veteran Janis Paige assumed the part. The soap showed promise with an early Alexis Carrington-style villainess, Augusta Lockridge (Louise Sorel), but even though critics praised her performance, her storyline was suddenly dropped and Sorel left the show. She would return later on a recurring basis and signed a contract when the Lockridges were written back in as regular characters.

When a major earthquake hit Santa Barbara, core character Danny Andrade slept through the whole thing. Minx Lockridge was unfazed, saying that the 1984 Santa Barbara earthquake was nothing like the one in 1925. She was later locked in an empty sarcophagus. Luckily, her grandchildren were around to let her out and she escaped with merely a bruised ego.

Under new executive producer Jill Farren Phelps&#x27; tenure, most of the show revolved around Cruz and Eden. By concentrating on such popular characters as Eden Capwell and Cruz Castillo, C.C. Capwell and his wife Sophia, Mason Capwell and Julia Wainwright Capwell, Gina Blake, and Augusta and Lionel Lockridge, the program achieved critical acclaim as well as slowly but surely rising ratings. The show was famous for its comedic style and offbeat writing. For example, in the July 14, 1986, episode, former nun Mary Duvall McCormick (Harley Jane Kozak) was killed by a giant neon letter &quot;C&quot; (for &quot;Capwell&quot;) atop the Capwell Hotel toppling on her while she was standing on the hotel roof during an argument (this was later referenced in the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;Homeland Insecurity&quot;). Despite an irate letter-writing campaign by the show&#x27;s fans (and an offer from the soap to come back), Kozak was reported as saying that she had &quot;no desire to return to SB&quot;, or in fact, any other daytime soap. Another example from 1989 involved Greg Hughes (Paul Johansson) having a dream while unconscious about Mason and Julia being aliens and being taken to &quot;The Capwell Zone&quot;. Also in 1988, Julia backs out of her wedding to Mason while at the altar giving their wedding vows, revealing to Father Michael she is in love with him and they make love.

In October 1987, the Dobsons were locked out of NBC studios after repeated attempts to fire the head writer, Charles Pratt, Jr. They sued, and were eventually allowed to return to the program in 1991, but ratings never recovered, even as the show won three Daytime Emmys in a row for Outstanding Drama Series.

==Cast and characters==

Following common daytime drama practice, over the years the producers of &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; recast original characters multiple times. By the end of the series, almost every original character had been recast, excluding only Eden Capwell and Cruz Castillo, Lionel, and Augusta. Out of those four, not one stayed with the show during through the entire run. The characters of Kelly, C.C., and Santana had the highest number of recasts, four each. Some recasts proved successful, most notably Jed Allan (C.C. Capwell #4), Judith McConnell (Sophia Capwell #2) and Robin Mattson (Gina Blake DeMott #2), but many were upsetting to fans.

The first notable departure was Robin Wright, to focus on her film career following the success of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; the previous year, ending her four-year run as the original Kelly Capwell, in 1988, Following Wright were the departures of Todd McKee as the original Ted Capwell, Justin Deas in 1988, Lane Davies as Mason Capwell and Marcy Walker in 1991. By 1992, most of the original characters had either been recast a few times or written out, and new characters arrived on the scene. Roscoe Born was cast in the dual roles of twin brothers Robert Barr and Quinn Armitage from 1989 – 1991.

In 1990, Leonardo DiCaprio received a Best Young Actor in a Daytime Series Nomination at the 12th Youth in Film Awards for his appearance as a young Mason Capwell. After Zack Kelton&#x27;s death, McCloskey returned as a new character, district attorney Ethan Asher. Steven Nichols joined the cast as psychologist Scyler Gates in September 1992.

Louise Sorel was written out in 1991 because she did not want to have a romance with Dash Nichols, the man who had raped Augusta&#x27;s sister Julia. Eden, Cruz, and most of the Lockridges had been written out while new characters played by stars from other shows such as Kim Zimmer, Jack Wagner, and Sydney Penny took up most of the airtime. Nicolas Coster had returned after a 2½-year absence but his character disappeared soon after as Coster could not come to terms over the lack of storyline he had gotten after such promise when he came back. By the time Coster had resolved the issues and returned permanently, Louise Sorel was on her way out, and Lionel was paired in a romance with C.C.&#x27;s former wife, Gina.

The final episode aired in January 1993. The only remaining original actor from the pilot was Margarita Cordova as the faithful Capwell housekeeper Rosa Andrade, although many of the original characters remained, including C.C., Sophia, Kelly, Mason, Ted, Warren Lockridge, Lionel, Gina, and Minx. In the finale, Sophia and C.C. Capwell moved towards a reconciliation, Kelly found love with Connor McCabe, and at Warren and BJ&#x27;s wedding, unbalanced Andie Klein aimed a gun at the crowd; however, she was quickly disarmed and carried away by Connor. This was then followed by a roll-call list of the cast and crew. The final shot consisted of executive producer Paul Rauch standing in front of the camera, smashing a cigar under his shoe, and walking away.

== Crew history ==

During the first three years of the show, the main crew of &quot;SB&quot; stayed the same, with the Dobsons taking on a double duty as both head writer and executive producer. Jeffrey Hayden served as co-executive producer during the first year, and Mary-Ellis Bunim took over after him. In 1987, after the Dobsons were abruptly fired, associate head writer Charles Pratt Jr. received head writing status and Anne Howard Bailey joined him as co-head writer until 1989, when Sheri Anderson took over that duty.

Jill Farren Phelps was hired from the beginning of the production as the Music Director. In 1987, she took over as executive producer until 1990 when she was replaced by John Conboy, although there was a five-month transition period where both were credited. In 1990, Pratt was replaced by another associate writer, Maralyn Thoma, but her tenure was cut short when the Dobsons finally settled in court and returned to the series. Shortly before the Dobsons returned, Conboy was let go and Paul Rauch was brought on as executive producer. The Dobsons left their head writing duties in 1992, when Pam Long was hired as the show&#x27;s final head writer.

==Ratings history==
NBC usually pitted &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; against &quot;General Hospital&quot; on ABC and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; on CBS, both of which enjoyed high ratings at the time in the same time slot across all markets. When NBC canceled the long-running soap &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; in 1986, it launched its &quot;NBC Daytime... It Will Excite You&quot; campaign, which promoted their three-hour block of serials starting with &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, followed by &quot;Another World&quot;, and ending with &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in most markets across the U.S. However, some markets chose to air &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in a mid-morning timeslot, taking it out of competition with other soaps.

Although &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; enjoyed considerable worldwide popularity, it never achieved the same heights in the United States. In its debut (1984–1985) season, it finished in 11th place and 3.4, and edged up to 10th and 4.2 the next year. By 1987, however, it did begin to generate respectable numbers: it was still in 10th place, but achieved a 4.9 rating, the highest in the history of the show. (Incidentally, the 1987–1988 television season also proved to be the best ratings performance of the 1980s for NBC&#x27;s daytime soap lineup, which had been in ratings trouble since the late 1970s.)

As quickly as the ratings rose for &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, they fell just as quickly. After recording a 4.8 rating in the 1988–1989 season, the serial dropped a full ratings point the next season. Many of the stations airing the show began looking elsewhere for programming and began preempting &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in favor of other shows. Some dropped the program altogether while others moved it to either an earlier time slot, such as the open 10:00 a.m. hour that NBC gave back to the affiliates in 1991 while some stations even moved the program to late night. In September 1992, with ratings barely hovering above a 3.0, NBC decided to rework its daytime schedule. The network announced that &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; would be cancelled at the midway point of the 1992–93 season, with the final episode airing January 15, 1993. NBC would then give the 3:00 p.m. hour back to its affiliates, and in exchange for it they would take back the 12:00 p.m. hour, which they had not programmed since &quot;Generations&quot; (which aired in the 12:30 p.m. timeslot) was cancelled; NBC had already given back the 12:00 p.m. timeslot to its affiliates when &quot;Super Password&quot; ended its run in 1989. &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; saw its place on the schedule taken by two Reg Grundy Organisation-produced game shows, a revival of the company&#x27;s earlier hit &quot;Scrabble&quot; and a new program based on the board game &quot;Scattergories&quot;. Shortly before the program ended, New World Television tried to shop &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; to other broadcast and cable networks, but failed to find one that would air the show.

*In the United Kingdom, &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; was the first, and only, American daytime soap opera to be broadcast on ITV, the UK&#x27;s first commercial television network. It was launched Monday, 7 September 1987, as part of a brand new mid-morning line-up, and it was intended to compete with the sunshine and glamour of the BBC&#x27;s Australian soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;. This was an unusual move, considering all of ITV&#x27;s other daytime soap operas airing at the time were also from Australia. ITV bought the first 130 episodes of &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; and they were split into two 23-minute episodes (thus creating 260 editions), and initially aired across the network at 10:00-10:25, Monday to Friday. Less than a year later, by Friday, 15 July 1988, it was decided that the series had not been a success, and most ITV companies dropped the series. However, a few decided to keep the series going in their local area and they purchased the next 125 episodes (the rest of the first season), and they were broadcast in wildly varying timeslots between summer 1988 until May 1991, usually twice weekly. Satellite channel, Sky One, then picked it up from the second season, and it aired on from 25 February 1991 to 29 May 1992 in an afternoon slot, before briefly switching to the Sky Soap channel in 1994. &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; was mainly shown in the 23-minute format in the UK, although some ITV regions broadcast it in the hour-long format when burning off episodes during the early hours of the morning in the early 90s. The only American daytime soap opera that has successfully been broadcast in the UK is &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, which aired on Channel 5 in the late 90s. Coincidentally, &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; was NBC&#x27;s eventual replacement for &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; when it began in 1997.
*In Zimbabwe, the show aired on ZBC TV1 from 1991 to 1997.

The series enjoyed great success in France during the first seasons. It was broadcast at primetime at 7:00 p.m., attracting between 8 and 10 million viewers each evening.

==Reception==
New York Times television critic and cultural news reporter John Corry enthusiastically describes “Santa Barbara” as “good trashy fun” recapping characters, plot twists and social themes, while surmising “the dramatic possibilities here are endless.” He calls it “pretty good stuff” speculating “one wonders how Dame Judith, flicking her riding crop, is going to involve herself in what comes next” writing “It is probable that any number of viewers will tune in tomorrow to find out.”

Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;As for whether &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; really is worse than the soaps that are doing well in the ratings, that&#x27;s a tough call. On the surface, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be inferior to all those other daytime offerings designed for people with too much time to kill.&quot;

In its first year, a reviewer for &quot;People Weekly&quot; wrote that the &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; TV series &quot;could be the worst show on TV—ever&quot;.

Mark Dawidziak claimed in August 1984 that &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; was &quot;a serial full of hammy acting, predictable story lines and atrocious dialogue&quot;.

==Music==
Joe Harnell composed the theme music for the show. Shortly afterwards, Dominic Messinger took on the position of composer and Music Director of the show. Music on the show was contemporary in style, with popular music themes composed and memorable original pop songs written specifically for each character and romantic couple, rather than the usual practice of soap operas of matching recorded cues to a scene.

Starting from the first episode, the show featured “If Ever You’re in My Arms Again&quot; by Peabo Bryson as a love theme for Joe Perkins and Kelly Capwell.

As of July 1988, Soap Opera Digest reported the most-requested love themes:

=== Cruz and Eden and Adriana ===

* All My Life – State of The Heart
* Nothing Can Take Me Away From You
* The Change in Me is You – James Dunne
* A Little Bit of Heaven (Turn Out The Lights) by Natalie Cole
* If I Believed – Patti Austin
* Take This Love – Sergio Mendes
* Amazing Grace – Judy Collins
* Smooth Love – Metropolis

=== Michael and Julia ===

* Two Worlds Apart – Billie Hughes
* Turn It All Around
* Nothing In Common

=== Mason and Julia ===

* Never Thought That I Could Love – Dan Hill

=== 1990-1991 Robert Barr and Kelly Capwell and Craig Hunt ===

* Welcome to the Edge – Billie Hughes

<text>Cholatse (), also known as Jobo Lhaptshan, is a mountain in the Khumbu region of the Nepalese Himalaya. Cholatse is connected to Taboche (6,501m) by a long ridge, with the Chola glacier descending from the mountain&#x27;s east face. The north and east faces of Cholatse can be seen from Dughla, on the trail to Mount Everest base camp.

There is a lake just below this pass to the east, and in Tibetan &#x27;cho&#x27; is lake, &#x27;la&#x27; is pass, and &#x27;tse&#x27; is peak so Cholatse means literally &quot;lake pass peak&quot;.
Cholatse was first climbed via the southwest ridge on 22 April 1982, by Vern Clevenger, Galen Rowell, John Roskelley, Bill O&#x27;Connor and Peter Hackett. The mountain&#x27;s north face was first climbed in 1984.

==Notable ascents==
* 1996 &quot;North Face&quot; – First ascent by a French team (Boris Badaroux, Philippe Batoux, Marc Challamel, Christophe Mora, Paul Robach (leader)). The climb took three days, the route (IV+, 90°, 1600m) started at the center of the north face, with sharp turns to the right at the beginning, then left at the middle and finally taking a turn to the right to join the northwest ridge that led the team to the summit.
* 2005 &quot;North Face&quot; – first ascent in winter by Korean team (Park Jung-hun, Choi Gang-sik), 16 January 2005.
* 2005 &quot;North Face&quot; – first solo ascent, by Ueli Steck, 15 April 2005.
* 2005 &quot;Southwest Ridge&quot; – summit reached by Kevin Thaw, Conrad Anker, Kris Erickson, John Griber and Abby Watkins on 12 May 2005.
* 2010 &quot;North Face (new variant)&quot; – A team (Galya Cibitoke, Alexander Gukov, Sergei Kondrashkin, Viktor Koval, and Valery Shamalo) from St. Petersburg, Russia, made an ascent of a new variant of the north face at the end of the calendar winter. The route ascended a huge rock buttress on the right of the French route of 1996, which it joined at ca.5,900m. The route&#x27;s difficulty was Russian 6B, VI+, A2, 80°, 1,600m.
* 2021 &quot;North Face left flank&quot; – Five members from an eight-member French expedition opened a new route on the left flank of Cholatse&#x27;s north face/northeast face. After five days of climbing (25–29 October), the French reached the top. The route was named &quot;Brothers In Arms&quot; (ED, VI, M5+, WI5, 1,600m) and was dedicated to three of their colleagues (Thomas Arfi , Gabriel Miloche and Louis Pachoud) who went missing after an avalanche on Mingbo Eiger (6,070m) southeast of Ama Dablam on 26 October.

<text>EDtv is a 1999 American satirical comedy film directed by Ron Howard. An adaptation of the Quebecois film &quot;Louis 19, King of the Airwaves (Louis 19, le roi des ondes)&quot; (1994), it stars Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau, Rob Reiner, Sally Kirkland, Elizabeth Hurley, Clint Howard, and Dennis Hopper.

The movie received mixed-to-positive reviews, with some criticizing its similarity to &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), and was a box office failure, grossing $35.2 million against an $80 million production budget.

==Plot==
Television network True TV is commencing interviews for a planned reality show that shows a normal person&#x27;s life 24/7, created by TV producer Cynthia. They interview Ed Pekurny and his brother, Ray. When the producers see the interview, Cynthia chooses Ed. The show hits the airwaves under the title &quot;Ed TV.&quot; It is a total failure at first, as only boring things happen. The producers want to pull the plug, but Cynthia remains determined that the show will succeed.

Ed TV gets interesting when Ed visits Ray. Ed (along with the cameramen) discovers that Ray is cheating on his girlfriend Shari. Ed visits Shari to apologize to her for Ray&#x27;s actions, but a drunk Shari starts insulting Ray, calling him &quot;a bad lay&quot;, to the audience&#x27;s amusement. Ed tries to comfort Shari, revealing he has feelings for her; she reveals she has feelings for him too, and they kiss, making Ed TV extremely popular. At Cynthia&#x27;s insistence, Ed starts a relationship with Shari, but their relationship is short-lived, as Ed grows more interested in staying on TV and Shari is abused by viewers who find her unappealing.

Ed goes on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and meets beautiful model and actress Jill who takes a liking to Ed. Ed visits Shari, who tells him she does not want to be with him until Ed TV stops airing. She then leaves town. Ed goes to a park to play football with Ray when Jill arrives to invite Ed over for dinner at her house, as Cynthia brought her in to earn more ratings. When Ed arrives at Jill&#x27;s house, there is a massive crowd. The two have a small talk, and kiss on top of a table. They are about to have sex, but Ed falls off the table and lands on her cat, which results in a sore back for the former and a broken leg for the latter. Ed never sees Jill again, and he also finds out his brother wrote a book (called &quot;My Brother Pissed on Me&quot;).

Ed&#x27;s father Hank, who abandoned his family when Ed was thirteen, unexpectedly visits Ed and informs him that he left because Ed&#x27;s mother was having an affair with Ed&#x27;s current stepfather, Al. Ed is furious with his mother Jeanette, who had previously claimed that she had only met Al after Hank left, and argues with her. Ed then gets a phone call telling him to come to the hospital, where he is told his father died making love to his wife. Ed assumes the father in question is Al, but it is actually Hank, who was having an affair with Jeanette.

After Hank&#x27;s funeral, Ed becomes disheartened by how the producers want him to stay on longer and that he cannot do anything to change their minds or he would be in breach of his contract. Ed is depressed until he notices a disguised Shari. He chases her to a women&#x27;s bathroom in a movie theater, where she explains that she is staying with her brother for his birthday and that she just wanted to see Ed. Ed vows to find a way to end the show to be with Shari. When Ed exits, one cameraman stays with Shari, explaining that it is the producers&#x27; new idea: Ed&#x27;s entire family is being filmed, but they will focus on the most interesting person, eliminating his family&#x27;s right to privacy for as long as the show will air.

Ed gets an idea on how to stop the main producer from airing the show: he will give $10,000 to the person who can give him the best amount of &quot;dirt&quot; on the producers and that he will announce it live, with the desired result being that they stop airing the show before he can make the announcement. As Cynthia feels sorry for Ed, she tells him a secret of the main producer. Ed announces the secret (that the man has to pump a liquid into his penis to get an erection), but before he can announce who it is, the show is taken off the air.

After the camera crew finally leaves Ed&#x27;s apartment, he and Shari renew their relationship and celebrate as TV news panelists predict Ed will be forgotten in a short period of time.

==Release==
The film was screened out of competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;EDtv&quot; opened in third place behind &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; and &quot;Analyze This&quot;, making $8.3 million during its opening weekend. The film was a box-office failure, grossing $35.2 million against a production budget of $80 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;EDtv&quot; has an approval rating of 63%, based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;If it&#x27;s not as ambitious as &quot;The Truman Show&quot; in satirizing the voyeuristic nature of television, &quot;EdTV&quot; is an amiable, witty comedy with fine performances from Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a rating of 48 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Ross Anthony of &quot;Hollywood Report Card&quot; questioned the plausibility of parts of the script but wrote: &quot;Though the thunder of its big idea may have been lost to &quot;The Truman Show&quot; [...], this screenplay still has real and punchy dialogue. Despite its faults &quot;EDtv&quot; will engage from beginning till end.&quot;

Roger Ebert, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film 2 and a 1/2 out of 4 stars. Ebert stated that although they share the same idea, &quot;The Truman Show&quot; is a parable, and &quot;EDtv&quot; is an ambitious sitcom. Ebert wondered what type of person would sign up for a show like this, and did not believe that Ed is that kind of person, so &quot;the film never quite feels convincing.&quot;

<text>Cumrun Vafa (, ; born 1 August 1960) is an Iranian-American theoretical physicist and the Hollis Professor of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy at Harvard University.

==Early life and education==
Cumrun Vafa was born in Tehran, Iran on 1 August 1960. He became interested in physics as a young child, specifically how the moon was not falling from the sky, and he later grew his interests in math by high school and was fascinated by how mathematics could predict the movement of objects.

He graduated from Alborz High School in Tehran and moved to the United States in 1977 to study at university. He received a B.S. in mathematics and physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1981. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1985 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Symmetries, inequalities and index theorems&quot;, under the supervision of Edward Witten.

== Academia ==
After his PhD degree, Vafa became a junior fellow via the Harvard Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he later got a junior faculty position. In 1989 he was offered a senior faculty position, and he has been there ever since.

Vafa worked at Princeton University within the Institute for Advanced Study, within the School of Natural Sciences and the School of Mathematics in 1994.

==Research==
Vafa&#x27;s research is primarily in string theory, and is focused on the nature of quantum gravity and the relation between geometry and quantum field theories. He is known in the string theory community for his co-discovery with Strominger that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole can be accounted for by solitonic states of superstring theory, and for expounding the relation between geometry and field theories that arise through string dualities (culminating in the Gopakumar–Vafa conjecture). This topic has been known as &quot;geometric engineering of quantum field theories&quot;.

In 1997, he developed F-theory, a 12-dimensional theory that compactifies to 10-D Type IIB superstring theory.

He is also interested in understanding the underlying meaning of string dualities, as well as trying to apply superstring theory to some unsolved questions of elementary particle physics such as the hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem.

He has made contributions to topological string theories and to the understanding of mirror symmetry.

He is a trustee of Network of Iranians for Knowledge and Innovation (NIKI).

== Awards and honors ==
In 2017, Vafa, alongside Andrew Strominger and Joseph Polchinski, jointly won the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for their advancement of string theory and jointly won the 2014 Breakthrough Prize in Physics Frontiers Prize.

He is the recipient of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)&#x27;s, 2008 Dirac Medal, which was won alongside Juan Maldacena, and Joseph Polchinski for their advancement of string theory.

In 1998 he was a Plenary Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians.

In 2016, Vafa was awarded the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics.

Vafa was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005 and as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2009.

In 2021, Vafa was awarded the Mustafa Prize.

== Publications ==

=== Research articles ===
Vafa has co-authored and published more than 300 research articles in the fields of string theory, mathematics, and physics, with many other researchers including: Robbert Dijkgraaf, Hirosi Ooguri, Mina Aganagic, Sergei Gukov, Rajesh Gopakumar, Lotte Hollands, and many others.

<text>William Pinkney (March 17, 1764February 25, 1822) was an American statesman and diplomat, and was appointed the seventh U.S. Attorney General by President James Madison.

==Biography==
William Pinkney was born in 1764 in Annapolis in the Province of Maryland. His parents&#x27; home was on the banks of the Severn River, from where the family could see the Chesapeake Bay. He had English ancestry.

Pinkney attended the private King William school. His teacher was a Mr. Brefhard. Although Pinkney left school at the age of thirteen, he had impressed his teacher with his intelligence, and Brefhard agreed to give the youth private lessons at home.

Pinkney studied medicine (which he did not practice) and &quot;read the law&quot; with an established firm, as was the practice at the time for aspiring lawyers. He was admitted to the bar in 1786. After practicing law for two years in Harford County, Maryland, Pinkney was elected as a delegate to Maryland&#x27;s state constitutional convention.

Pinkney was an excellent orator who possessed an impressive command of language. He was said to have been articulate and pleasing in manner.

After beginning his law practice, he married Anne Rodgers. They had ten children together. Edward Coote Pinkney, born seventh, was ranked as an accomplished poet posthumously. He died of tuberculosis before his 26th birthday.

==Political career==
In April 1788, Pinkney was elected a delegate to the convention of the State of Maryland, which ratified the United States Constitution. This marked the beginning of his political career.

Pinkney served in numerous electoral offices, at the local, state and national level. He was elected to and served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1788 to 1792 and then again in 1795. He was elected mayor of Annapolis, serving from 1795 to 1800.

He was elected in 1790 as a U.S. Congressman from Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, serving in 1791. After the war of 1812, Pinkney was elected in 1814 from the fifth district, and served from 1815 until 1816.

He also had numerous political appointments. In 1801 he was appointed Attorney General for the District of Pennsylvania, by President Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson next appointed him as Attorney General of Maryland, where he served from 1805 to 1806.

Pinkney was nominated as a diplomat, serving with James Monroe as co-U.S. Ministers to the Court of St James&#x27;s in Great Britain, 1806 to 1807. President Jefferson asked them to negotiate an end to harassment of American shipping, but Britain showed no signs of improving relations. The men negotiated the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty, but it lacked provisions to end British impressment of American sailors, and was subsequently rejected by President Jefferson and never implemented.

Pinkney was Minister Plenipotentiary from 1808 until 1811. He returned to Maryland, serving in the Maryland State Senate in 1811. In 1811 he joined President James Madison&#x27;s cabinet as his Attorney General.

He was commissioned as a major in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812 and was wounded at the Battle of Bladensburg, Maryland in August 1814. After the War, he served as congressman from the fifth district of Maryland from 1815 to 1816. He was next appointed by President James Monroe as the U.S. Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia from 1816 until 1818, along with a special mission to the Kingdom of Naples.

Pinkney successfully argued many important cases before the Supreme Court, including the landmark case of &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot; (1819), in which the right of the U.S. Congress to charter the Bank of the United States was upheld.

In 1818 Pinkney was elected by the state legislature (as was the practice then) as a U.S. Senator from Maryland, serving from 1819 until his death in 1822. He is buried at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Criticism==

Writer, critic, and fellow Baltimore lawyer John Neal dedicated eight pages in his 1823 novel &quot;Randolph&quot; to criticizing William Pinkney. Though written before Pinkney&#x27;s death, it was published shortly afterward with a footnote explaining that the author acknowledged Pinkney&#x27;s death but decided to publish the book as originally written anyway. Though Neal referred to him as &quot;the greatest lawyer in America,&quot; he also characterized his speeches as &quot;a compound of stupendous strength; feeble ornament; affected earnestness, and boisterous, turbulent declamation,&quot; concluding that &quot;God never meant William Pinkney for an orator.&quot; Neal&#x27;s insults went as far as to call Pinkney &quot;a notorious sloven&quot; who could be seen &quot;wiping his nose and lips on the sleeve of his coat.&quot;

On the basis of these printed insults, Pinkney&#x27;s son Edward Coote Pinkney challenged Neal to a duel, which Neal refused. The episode likely contributed to Neal&#x27;s decision to leave Baltimore later that year.

<text>Einar is a Scandinavian given name deriving from the Old Norse name Einarr, which according to Guðbrandur Vigfússon is directly connected with the concept of the einherjar, warriors who died in battle and ascended to Valhalla in Norse mythology. Vigfússon comments that &#x27;the name Einarr is properly = einheri&quot; and points to a relation to the term with the Old Norse common nouns &quot;einarðr&quot; (meaning &quot;bold&quot;) and &quot;einörð&quot; (meaning &quot;valour&quot;).

<text>Deborah Denine Pryce (born July 29, 1951) is an American lawyer, jurist, and politician from Ohio who was the member of the United States House of Representatives for Ohio&#x27;s 15th congressional district, which includes the western half of Columbus and the surrounding suburbs, from 1993 to 2009. She is a member of the Republican Party.

== Education and early career ==
Born in Warren, Ohio, Pryce is a 1973 graduate of Ohio State University, where she was a member of Alpha Xi Delta. In 1976, she graduated from Capital University Law School.

Pryce was an administrative law judge for the Ohio State Department of Insurance for 1976–1978. From 1978 to 1985 she worked for the city of Columbus, Ohio, first as an assistant city prosecutor, then as a senior assistant city attorney, and finally as an assistant city manager.

Pryce was a judge in the Franklin County Municipal Court from 1985 to 1992, ending as presiding judge.

== Congressional career ==
Pryce was first elected to the U.S. House in November 1992. Until the election of 2006, she was the Chair of the House Republican Conference, which is the fourth-highest Republican position in the United States House of Representatives. This position has been held by J. C. Watts, Dick Cheney and Jack Kemp, among others. She also served as a deputy Republican whip.

Pryce was a member of the House Committee on Financial Services and was ranking minority member of the Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee. She returned to the committee after spending ten years on the House Rules Committee.

Pryce is a fiscally and socially conservative Republican, although she was a member of multiple center right groups such as the Republican Main Street Partnership, Republicans For Environmental Protection, the Republican Majority For Choice, Republicans for Choice and The Wish List (a pro-choice women&#x27;s group). She does not favor banning abortion, saying &quot;the Government should not interfere in decisions a woman makes about her pregnancy.&quot; 

In November 2006, when asked about the war in Iraq, Pryce ended an interview with CNN by walking away. In a statement later issued to CNN, Pryce said: &quot;What&#x27;s happening in Iraq is not a direct reflection on me.&quot; The statement also said that &quot;I voted to give the president the authority to use force in Iraq; that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m always happy with what I see, but I can think of nothing worse for our troops or our prospects for success than having 435 members of Congress second-guessing our commanders.&quot;

Pryce voted to make the United States Environmental Protection Agency a cabinet department, to expedite forest thinning projects, and to de-authorize &quot;critical habitat&quot; designated by the Endangered Species Act. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) has named her to its &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; list of environmentally irresponsible federal officeholders; the organization gave Pryce an environmental score of 13 out of 100 for 2006 and 16 out of 100 for her career record. LCV also criticized Price for accepting more than $90,000 from oil and gas companies and for voting in accordance with energy interests.

==Votes in the 110th Congress==
Formerly in charge of keeping GOP House members in line with the party&#x27;s message, Pryce appeared in early 2007 to be changing her voting record, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, on January 14, 2007: &quot;After narrowly escaping defeat in November, the swing-district Republican bolted from her party&#x27;s leadership last year. Last week, she virtually bolted from the party. With just one exception, Pryce sided with the new Democratic majority on every major bill and rule change that came to a vote in the past two weeks, even voting against her party on a procedural vote, a move considered heretical in the years of GOP control.&quot; 

However, on the topic of Iraq, which the House discussed in detail in winter and early spring of 2007, Pryce sided firmly with her Republican colleagues, supporting Ohio Republican congressman John Boehner&#x27;s H.R. 1062, &quot;holding the Administration and the Iraqi government accountable for progress in the prosecution of the war in Iraq.&quot; The bill &quot;requires the President to submit a status report to Congress every 30 days detailing the success of the recent 21,500 troop increase and the extent to which the Iraqi government is cooperating with the US stability efforts. It also creates a bipartisan panel to study proposals from relevant committees, the executive branch, and private sector entities concerning the development of US policy and strategy in Iraq.&quot; 

During her successful 2006 campaign to retain her seat, Pryce distanced herself from the Bush administration by stating on CNN radio that, &quot;What&#x27;s happening in Iraq is not a direct reflection on me.&quot; 

== Elections ==
In her first election in 1992, Pryce won in a three-way race in which an independent conservative, pro-life candidate, Linda Reidelbach, received almost 20% of the vote; Pryce got slightly over 45%. Between 1994 and 2002, Pryce won with at least 2/3 of the vote each election.

In the 2004 Republican party primary, Pryce defeated Charles R. Morrison II, 84%–16%. She won the general election with 62% of the vote, defeating Democrat Mark P. Brown. She had previously defeated Brown in the November 2002 election.

=== 2006 race ===
In the November 2006 general election, Pryce faced Democratic Franklin County Commissioner Mary Jo Kilroy .

The race in Ohio&#x27;s 15th district gained significant national attention as one of a handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. In mid-October 2006, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to Pryce&#x27;s high-ranking post in the Republican leadership as well as the strong anti-Republican mood in Ohio. The 15th had long been considered the more Republican of the two districts that divide Columbus but had become slightly less Republican as a result of the 2000 round of redistricting.

In an article titled &quot;Pork No Longer Paves the Way to Reelection,&quot; the Amherst Times cited Deborah Pryce as a counterexample of that thesis:

&quot;[In] several races... the ability to bring home hundreds of federal projects might have made enough of a difference to withstand a Democratic tide. Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, issued dozens of news releases over the last 18 months boasting of the projects she brought home to a district that is considered evenly divided between the two parties[:] $2.27 million to convert a mountain of garbage into a green energy center, $1.1 million to help keep residents of a fast-growing suburb from having to pay more in user fees for a new sewage system, and the latest installment in $2.7 million in federal disbursements to &#x27;evaluate freeze-dried berries for their ability to inhibit cancer&#x27;... [At one point] Ms. Pryce&#x27;s district stood to get the largest single earmark in Ohio—$1.75 million for a health research institute. In total, the Columbus area lined up about $4.5 million in special money... By comparison, Portland, Ore.—a similar-sized metropolitan area with no contested Congressional seats—was to receive $625,000 in earmarks.&quot;

Two debates were held for the 2006 congressional race. The first took place September 18 and the second was held on October 12. In the first debate Pryce and her challenger, Kilroy discussed the war in Iraq, the war on terror, taxes, social security, the federal deficit and President Bush.

The second debate was marked by a more heated exchange from both participants. Kilroy referred to Pryce as a &quot;right-wing apologist&quot; and said that &quot;Deborah Pryce continues to distort my record.&quot; Pryce countered by describing her opponent as a &quot;far left fringe Democrat&quot; and said that Kilroy, &quot;spews lies and misinformation.&quot; The debate was attended by 400 people at the Ohio State University Fawcett Center and reporters from as far away as Ireland.

Pryce received a number of endorsements for the 15th District race in 2006, including: the Business and Professional Women, the Franklin County Republican Party, Union County Republican Party Executive Committee, National Federation of Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Fraternal Order of Police. The Human Rights Campaign gave a dual endorsement to both Pryce and her opponent, Kilroy.

Pryce&#x27;s 2006 race against Kilroy was very close, as she held a lead of 3,536 votes after an initial count. Complete tallies found Pryce winning rural Madison and Union counties but losing her portion of Franklin County (urban Columbus) by several thousand votes. Pryce ended Election Night 1,055 votes ahead of Kilroy, but the difference was within a half-percentage point, which triggered an automatic recount under Ohio law.

After the mandatory recount resulted in 110,739 Pryce votes to 109,677 for Kilroy, Pryce was certified the winner.

On August 16, 2007, Pryce announced she would not run for a ninth term, citing a desire to spend more time with her daughter and aging parents.

Pryce&#x27;s term ended on January 3, 2009. Price was succeeded by Mary Jo Kilroy, who had lost to her two years before.

In 2013, Pryce was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

<doc id="644864" wikidata="Q7033839" url="?curid=644864" title="Nightingales (British TV series)">
<text>Nightingales is a British situation comedy set around the antics of three security guards working the night shift. It was written by Paul Makin and produced by Alomo Productions for Channel 4 in 1990.

==Plot==
&quot;Nightingales&quot; revolved around the jobs of three bored nightwatchmen working in a deserted office block, the location of which is never revealed, although exterior shots are of Beneficial House located on Paradise Circus in Birmingham City Centre.

A typical episode involved both very naturalistic dialogue — and the kind of claustrophobic studio-setting that prevailed in shows such as &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; — combined with the surreal.

&quot;Nightingales&quot; ran for two series totalling 13 episodes from 27 February 1990 to 10 February 1993. The long delay was prompted by Channel 4 executive Seamus Cassidy who was not happy with the proposed scripts for the second series and it was nearly three years before it was given the go-ahead. The theme tune was a version of the song &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; sung by Lindsay. Writer Paul Makin went on to write more conventional comedies like &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;. A US remake (titled &quot;In Security&quot;) was piloted but never commissioned.

==Cast and characters==
* Robert Lindsay as Carter, a pseudo-intellectual whose aspirations were invariably frustrated.
* David Threlfall as &quot;Ding Dong&quot; Bell, a moronic thug who is somewhat in awe of Carter.
* James Ellis as Sarge, an impossibly optimistic veteran watchman (who is occasionally used to parody the naive optimism of Dixon of Dock Green).
* Smith, a fourth character who was dead throughout the first series, the other characters kept his body in the building so that they could claim his salary.

Guest characters included Piper (Edward Burnham), the elderly cleaning man; Eric the werewolf (Ian Sears); an additional security guard who was a gorilla; and Mary the Christmas Allegory (Lia Williams), who gave birth to consumer products.

<doc id="644870" wikidata="Q1140761" url="?curid=644870" title="Heterotic string theory">
<text>In string theory, a heterotic string is a closed string (or loop) which is a hybrid (&#x27;heterotic&#x27;) of a superstring and a bosonic string. There are two kinds of heterotic superstring theories, the heterotic SO(32) and the heterotic E8 × E8, abbreviated to HO and HE. Apart from that there exist seven more heterotic string theories which are not supersymmetric and hence are only of secondary importance in most applications. Heterotic string theory was first developed in 1985 by David Gross, Jeffrey Harvey, Emil Martinec, and Ryan Rohm (the so-called &quot;Princeton string quartet&quot;), in one of the key papers that fueled the first superstring revolution.

==Overview==
In string theory, the left-moving and the right-moving excitations of strings are completely decoupled for a closed string, and it is possible to construct a string theory whose left-moving (counter-clockwise) excitations are treated as a bosonic string propagating in &quot;D&quot; = 26 dimensions, while the right-moving (clockwise) excitations are treated as a superstring in &quot;D&quot; = 10 dimensions.

The mismatched 16 dimensions must be compactified on an even, self-dual lattice (a discrete subgroup of a linear space). There are two possible even self-dual lattices in 16 dimensions, and it leads to two types of the heterotic string. They differ by the gauge group in 10 dimensions. One gauge group is SO(32) (the HO string) while the other is E8 × E8 (the HE string).

These two gauge groups also turned out to be the only two anomaly-free gauge groups that can be coupled to the &quot;N&quot; = 1 supergravity in 10 dimensions. (Although not realized for quite some time, U(1)496 and E8 × U(1)248 are anomalous.)

Every heterotic string must be a closed string, not an open string; it is not possible to define any boundary conditions that would relate the left-moving and the right-moving excitations because they have a different character.

==String duality==
String duality is a class of symmetries in physics that link different string theories. In the 1990s, it was realized that the strong coupling limit of the HO theory is type I string theory — a theory that also contains open strings; this relation is called S-duality. The HO and HE theories are also related by T-duality.

Because the various superstring theories were shown to be related by dualities, it was proposed that each type of string was a different limit of a single underlying theory called M-theory.

<text>Ismail () is an Arabic given name. It corresponds to the English name Ishmael.

==Etymology and meaning==
The literal translation of the name &quot;Ismail&quot; is &quot;heard by God&quot; and according to Abrahamic tradition, it refers to the yearning of Abraham and his wife, Sarah, to have a child. Ismail&#x27;s mother, however, was not Sarah, but Hagar, Sarah&#x27;s maidservant, who Sarah gave to Abraham as a concubine because she was unable to have a child. Sarah later does give birth to a son, Isaac. 

According to Genesis, the name is given by God as He heard the cries of Hagar who had been mistreated by Sarah after becoming pregnant and run away.

According to Islamic tradition, Ismail&#x27;s mother, Hagar was also a full wife of the Prophet Abraham.

<doc id="644894" wikidata="Q1400264" url="?curid=644894" title="Artist collective">
<text>An artist collective or art group or artist group is an initiative that is the result of a group of artists working together, usually under their own management, towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the artist; this can range from purchasing bulk materials, sharing equipment, space or materials, to following shared ideologies, aesthetic and political views or even living and working together as an extended family. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an association or a company.

Many artist collectives had and still have a major and significant influence on the various epochs of art history. In a broader sense, literary groups and group formations of musicians can also be referred to as artist collectives or groups.

==Description==
===Purpose===
The aim of the artistic initiatives was and still is to get in touch with other artists, to point out avant-garde or newly defined efforts in art in the broadest sense, to break away from traditional, academic approaches altogether, to break new ground and to follow them for example by organizing joint exhibitions. The boundaries between all areas of fine and applied art are fluid.

In contrast to the mostly programmatically oriented artist collectives, only the costs for the use of common workspaces or artist ateliers are usually shared in studio communities. Due to long-standing friendships, thematic joint exhibitions and the inevitable examination of the work of the other members, however, mixed forms can form that go beyond the pure community of convenience.

===Between Artist Duo and Artists&#x27; Colony===
The transition from artist collective to artist colony is also fluid. One speaks of the latter when it comes to large-scale settlements of artists of the same direction. Examples of this are the Nazarene movement in Rome and the Barbizon school. The decisive factor here is the personal decision of the individual to align their place of residence with that of like-minded artists, which can be conducive to the optimal further development of the respective art movement.

The opposite extreme of an artist group is the artist duo – the smallest, but also the most symbiotic form. Often there are real-life partnerships (as with Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely, or also with Gilbert &amp; George). It is not uncommon for larger groups of artists to emerge from the &quot;nucleus&quot; of a duo, such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, for example, developed from the founding duo John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt.

===Criteria for the term &quot;art collective&quot; or &quot;art group&quot;===
Designations such as &quot;The Tachists&quot; or &quot;Junge Wilde&quot; (The Young Wild Ones) cannot be assigned to any real groups of artists; they merely indicate common stylistic features within an epoch. A clear indication of the actual existence of such a group is a written memorandum such as that published in André Breton&#x27;s &quot;Surrealist Manifesto&quot; in Paris in 1924 and signed by several like-minded artists. As a result, the members of such a group committed themselves to subordinate themselves to a common goal. This also included the group exhibitions, to which everyone should contribute their part instead of just showing themselves.

==Overview==
Artist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on Milos in Greece and Carrara in Italy. During the French Revolution the Louvre in Paris was occupied as an artist collective.

More traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in gallery shows or public spaces. Often an artist collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time-scales.

Artist collectives may be formed:
* for economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared,
* for political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief,
* for professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.

<doc id="644909" wikidata="Q616855" url="?curid=644909" title="SonicWall">
<text>SonicWall Inc. is an American cybersecurity company that sells a range of Internet appliances primarily directed at content control and network security. These include devices providing services for network firewalls, unified threat management (UTM), virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual firewalls, SD-WAN, cloud security and anti-spam for email. The company also markets information subscription services related to its products. The company also assists in solving problems surrounding compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).

Originally a private company headquartered in Silicon Valley, it went public in 1999, before delisting in 2010. On March 13, 2012, &quot;USA Today&quot; said that Dell had announced its intent to acquire SonicWall, which then had 130 patents and 950 employees. Dell&#x27;s acquisition of SonicWall became official on May 9, 2012.

On June 20, 2016, Dell sold SonicWall (part of its Dell Software division) to private equity firms Francisco Partners and Elliott Management.

==History==
In 1991, brothers Sreekanth Ravi and Sudhakar Ravi founded the company under the name Sonic Systems to develop Ethernet and Fast Ethernet cards, hubs and bridges for the Apple market.

In the late 1990s, the company released a security product initially called Interpol and later branded SonicWALL, a dedicated hardware appliance with firewall and VPN software intended for the small-business market. As sales for security appliances rapidly accelerated, the company exited the Apple add-on networking business and refocused exclusively as a network security company.

In late 1999, the company changed its name from Sonic Systems to SonicWALL, Inc. to represent the shift to network security, and in November 1999 SonicWall went public on the Nasdaq with the symbol SNWL.

In 2001, SonicWall upgraded its Global Management System (GMS) software to manage more VPN devices.

Matthew T. Medeiros (formerly of Philips Components) became CEO in March 2003. SonicWall has acquired several companies during its existence, often expanding its product line in the process. In 2005, SonicWall acquired enKoo and Lasso Logic, and in 2007 acquired Aventail Corporation.

On July 23, 2010, SonicWall completed its merger with affiliates of an investor group led by Thoma Bravo, which included the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan, through its private investor department, Teachers&#x27; Private Capital. After the merger, SonicWall was delisted from Nasdaq.

On March 13, 2012, Dell signed a definitive agreement to acquire SonicWall.

On May 20, 2016, Dell sold Dell Software, which included SonicWall, to private equity firms Francisco Partners and Elliott Management.

In March 2021, the SonicWall SecureFirst partner program received a five-star rating in the 2021 CRN Partner Program Guide.

On January 22, 2021, SonicWall said it was attacked by &quot;highly sophisticated threat actors&quot; in a potential zero-day attack on certain SonicWall secure remote access products. On January 25, former lulzsec hacker Darren Martyn announced exploits against old VPN vulnerabilities. These exploits and the January 2021 attack were unrelated; SonicWall confirmed that the Martyn exploits were patched in 2015.

On January 7, 2022, SonicWall said that some of its email security and firewall products were hit by the Y2k22 bug, and released patches after a few days.

On July 21, 2022, former president and CEO Bill Conner took on the role of Executive Chairman of the Board. Former SonicWall Chief Revenue Officer Bob VanKirk was named president and CEO.

<doc id="644912" wikidata="Q200995" url="?curid=644912" title="Certificate of deposit">
<text>A certificate of deposit (CD) is a time deposit sold by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions in the United States. CDs typically differ from savings accounts because the CD has a specific, fixed term before money can be withdrawn without penalty and generally higher interest rates. CDs require a minimum deposit and may offer higher rates for larger deposits. The bank expects the CDs to be held until maturity, at which time they can be withdrawn and interest paid.

In the United States, CDs are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for banks and by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for credit unions.

The consumer who opens a CD may receive a paper certificate, but it is now common for a CD to consist simply of a book entry and an item shown in the consumer&#x27;s periodic bank statements. Consumers who want a hard copy that verifies their CD purchase may request a paper statement from the bank, or print out their own from the financial institution&#x27;s online banking service.

== Features ==
In exchange for the customer depositing the money for an agreed upon term, institutions typically offer higher interest rates compared to accounts that allow immediate withdrawals, although this may vary in situations like an inverted yield curve. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) commonly offer fixed rates, but some institutions also provide CDs with variable rates. For instance, around mid-2004 when interest rates were anticipated to increase, many banks and credit unions started offering CDs with a &quot;bump-up&quot; feature. These CDs allow for a single adjustment of the interest rate at a time chosen by the consumer during the CD&#x27;s term. Additionally, financial institutions may introduce CDs linked to the performance of the stock market, bond market, or other indices.

Some features of CDs are:
* A larger principal should or may receive a higher interest rate.
* A longer term usually earns a higher interest rate, except in the case of an inverted yield curve (e.g., preceding a recession).
* Smaller institutions tend to offer higher interest rates than larger ones.
* Personal CD accounts generally receive higher interest rates than business CD accounts.
* Banks and credit unions that lack FDIC or NCUA insurance typically provide higher interest rates.

== Closure ==

Withdrawals before maturity are usually subject to a substantial penalty. For a five-year CD, this is often the loss of up to twelve months&#x27; interest. These penalties ensure that it is generally not in a holder&#x27;s best interest to withdraw the money before maturity –unless the holder has another investment with a significantly higher return or has a serious need for the money.

Institutions may mail a notice to the CD holder shortly before the CD matures requesting directions regarding withdrawal. The notice usually offers the choice of withdrawing the principal and accumulated interest or &quot;rolling it over&quot;, i.e. depositing it into a new CD. Generally, there is a &quot;window&quot; after maturity when CD can be cashed out without penalty. In the absence of such directions, the institution may roll over the CD automatically, once again tying up the money for a period of time. Additionally, the CD holder may be able to specify at the time the CD is opened for it not to be rolled over.

== Refinancing ==

The Truth in Savings Regulation DD requires that insured CDs state, at the time of account opening, the penalty for early withdrawal. It is generally accepted that these penalties cannot be revised by the depository prior to maturity. However, there have been cases in which a credit union modified its early withdrawal penalty and made it retroactive on existing accounts. The second occurrence happened when Main Street Bank of Texas closed a group of CDs early without full payment of interest. The bank claimed the disclosures allowed them to do so.

The penalty for early withdrawal deters depositors from taking advantage of subsequent better investment opportunities during the term of the CD. In rising interest rate environments, the penalty may be insufficient to discourage depositors from redeeming their deposit and reinvesting the proceeds after paying the applicable early withdrawal penalty. Added interest from the new higher-yielding CD may more than offset the cost of the early withdrawal penalty.

== Ladders ==

While longer investment terms yield higher interest rates, longer-term also may result in a loss of opportunity to lock in higher interest rates in a rising-rate economy. One mitigation strategy for this opportunity cost is the &quot;CD ladder&quot; strategy. In the ladder strategies, the investor distributes the deposits over a period of several years with the goal of having all one&#x27;s money deposited at the longest term (and therefore the higher rate) but in a way that part of it matures annually. In this way, the depositor claims the longest-term rates while retaining the option to re-invest or withdraw the money in shorter-term intervals.

For example, an investor beginning a three-year ladder strategy starts by depositing equal amounts of money each into a 3-year CD, 2-year CD, and 1-year CD. From that point on, a CD reaches maturity every year, at which time the investor can re-invest at a 3-year term. After two years of this cycle, the investor has all money deposited at a three-year rate yet have one-third of the deposits mature every year (which the investor can then reinvest, augment, or withdraw).

The ladder&#x27;s responsibility falls on the depositor, not the financial institution. Because the ladder does not depend on the financial institution, depositors can distribute a ladder strategy across multiple banks. This can be advantageous, as smaller banks may not offer the longer-term of some larger banks. Although laddering is most familiar with CDs, investors may use this strategy on any time deposit account with similar terms.

== Jumbo CD ==
The best interest rates are generally offered on &quot;Jumbo CDs&quot; with minimum deposits of $100,000. Jumbo CDs are commonly bought by large institutional investors, such as banks and pension funds, who are interested in low-risk and stable investment options. Jumbo CDs are negotiable certificates of deposit and come in bearer form. These work like conventional certificates of deposit that lock in the principal amount for a set timeframe and are payable upon maturity.

== Step-up callable CD ==
Step-up callable CDs are a form of CD where the interest rate increases multiple times prior to maturity of the CD. Typically, the beginning interest rate is higher than what is available on shorter-maturity CDs. These CDs are often issued with maturities up to 15 years, with a step-up in interest happening at year 5 and year 10.

These CDs have a “call” feature which allows the issuer to return the deposit to the investor after a specified period of time, which is usually at least a year. When the CD is called, the investor is given back their deposit and they will no longer receive any future interest payments.

Because of the call feature, interest rate risk is borne by the investor, rather than the issuer. This transfer of risk allows step-up callable CDs to offer a higher interest rate than currently available from non-callable CDs. If prevailing interest rates decline, the issuer will call the CD and re-issue debt at a lower interest rate. If the CD is called before maturity, the investor is faced with reinvestment risk. If prevailing interest rates increase, the issuer will allow the CD to go to maturity.

== Deposit insurance ==
The amount of insurance coverage varies, depending on how accounts for an individual or family are structured at the institution. The level of insurance is governed by complex FDIC and NCUA rules, available in FDIC and NCUA booklets or online. The standard insurance coverage is currently $250,000 per owner or depositor for single accounts or $250,000 per co-owner for joint accounts.

Some institutions use a private insurance company instead of, or in addition to, the federally backed FDIC or NCUA deposit insurance. Institutions often stop using private supplemental insurance when they find that few customers have a high enough balance level to justify the additional cost. The Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service program lets investors keep up to $50 million invested in CDs managed through one bank with full FDIC insurance. However rates will likely not be the highest available.

== Terms and conditions ==
There are many variations in the terms and conditions for CDs.

The federally required &quot;Truth in Savings&quot; booklet, or other disclosure document that gives the terms of the CD, must be made available before the purchase. Employees of the institution are generally not familiar with this information; only the written document carries legal weight. If the original issuing institution has merged with another institution, or if the CD is closed early by the purchaser, or there is some other issue, the purchaser will need to refer to the terms and conditions document to ensure that the withdrawal is processed following the original terms of the contract.
*The terms and conditions may be changeable. They may contain language such as &quot;We can add to, delete or make any other changes (&quot;Changes&quot;) we want to these Terms at any time.&quot;
*The CD may be callable. The terms may state that the bank or credit union can close the CD before the term ends.
*Payment of interest. Interest may be paid out as it is accrued or it may accumulate in the CD.
*Interest calculation. The CD may start earning interest from the date of deposit or from the start of the next month or quarter.
*Right to delay withdrawals. Institutions generally have the right to delay withdrawals for a specified period to stop a bank run.
*Withdrawal of principal. May be at the discretion of the financial institution. Withdrawal of principal below a certain minimum—or any withdrawal of principal at all—may require closure of the entire CD. A US Individual Retirement Account CD may allow withdrawal of IRA Required Minimum Distributions without a withdrawal penalty.
*Withdrawal of interest. May be limited to the most recent interest payment or allow for the withdrawal of accumulated total interest since the CD was opened. Interest may be calculated to the date of withdrawal or through the end of the last month or last quarter.
*Penalty for early withdrawal. May be measured in months of interest, may be calculated to be equal to the institution&#x27;s current cost of replacing the money, or may use another formula. May or may not reduce the principal—for example, if the principal is withdrawn three months after opening a CD with a six-month penalty.
*Fees. A fee may be specified for withdrawal or closure or for providing a certified check.
*Automatic renewal. The institution may or may not commit to sending a notice before automatic rollover at CD maturity. The institution may specify a grace period before automatically rolling over the CD to a new CD at maturity. Some banks have been known to renew at rates lower than that of the original CD.

== Limitations ==
There may be some correlation between CD interest rates and inflation. For example, in one situation interest rates might be 15% and inflation 15%, and in another situation interest rates might be 2% and inflation may be 2%. These factors cancel out, so the real interest rate is zero in both of these examples.

However the real rates of return offered by CDs, as with other fixed interest instruments, can vary significantly. For example, during a credit crunch banks are in dire need of funds, and CD interest rate increases may not track inflation.

The above does not include taxes. When taxes are considered, the higher-rate situation above is worse, with a lower (more negative) real return, although the before-tax real rates of return are identical. The after-inflation, after-tax return is what is important.

Author Ric Edelman writes: &quot;You don&#x27;t make any money in bank accounts (in real economic terms), simply because you&#x27;re not supposed to.&quot; On the other hand, he says, bank accounts and CDs are fine for holding cash for a short amount of time.

CD rates are correlated with the expected inflation at the time the CD is bought. The actual inflation may be lower or higher. Locking in the interest rate for a long term may be bad (if inflation goes up) or good (if inflation goes down). For example, in the 1970s, inflation increased higher than it had been, and this was not fully reflected in interest rates. This is particularly important, for longer-term notes, where the interest rate is locked in for some time. A little later, the opposite happened, and inflation declined.

In general, and similar to other fixed-interest investments, the economic value of a CD rises when market interest rates fall, and vice versa.

Some banks pay lower than average rates, while others pay higher rates. In the United States, depositors can take advantage of the best FDIC-insured rates without increasing their risk.

As with other types of investment, investors should be suspicious of a CD offering an unusually high rate of return. Conman Allen Stanford used fraudulent CDs with high rates to lure people into his Ponzi scheme.

<doc id="644913" wikidata="Q1142441" url="?curid=644913" title="ExpressCard">
<text>ExpressCard, initially called NEWCARD, is an interface to connect peripheral devices to a computer, usually a laptop computer. The ExpressCard technical standard specifies the design of slots built into the computer and of expansion cards to insert in the slots. The cards contain electronic circuits and sometimes connectors for external devices. The ExpressCard standard replaces the PC Card (also known as PCMCIA) standards.

ExpressCards can connect a variety of devices to a computer including mobile broadband modems (sometimes called &quot;connect cards&quot;), IEEE 1394 (FireWire) connectors, USB connectors, Ethernet network ports, Serial ATA storage devices, solid-state drives, external enclosures for desktop-size PCI Express graphics cards and other peripheral devices, wireless network interface controllers (NIC), TV tuner cards, Common Access Card (CAC) readers, and sound cards.

==Standards==
Originally developed by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), the ExpressCard standard is maintained by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). The host device supports PCI Express, USB 2.0 (including Hi-Speed), and USB 3.0 (SuperSpeed) (ExpressCard 2.0 only) connectivity through the ExpressCard slot; cards can be designed to use any of these modes. The cards are hot-pluggable. The ExpressCard standard is an open standard by ITU-T definition, and can be obtained from the USB-IF website free of charge.

USB-IF administers the ExpressCard Compliance Program, under which companies earn the right to obtain a license to use the ExpressCard logo on their compliant products.

==Form factors==

The ExpressCard standard specifies two form factors, ExpressCard/34 ( wide) and ExpressCard/54 ( wide, in an L-shape)—the connector is the same on both (34 mm wide). Standard cards are long ( shorter than CardBus) and thick, but may be thicker on sections that extend outside the standard form for antennas, sockets, etc. With its 75 mm standard length, the ExpressCard will protrude 5 mm over the holder&#x27;s surface (e.g. laptop surface), whereas a variant with 70 mm length remains level with the surface.

==Comparison to other standards==

The older PC Cards came in 16-bit and the later 32-bit CardBus designs. The major benefit of the ExpressCard over the PC card is more bandwidth, due to the ExpressCard&#x27;s direct connection to the system bus over a PCI Express ×1 lane and USB 2.0, while CardBus cards only interface with PCI. The ExpressCard has a maximum throughput of 2.5 Gbit/s through PCI Express and 480 Mbit/s through USB 2.0 dedicated for each slot, while all CardBus and PCI devices connected to a computer usually share a total 1.06 Gbit/s bandwidth.

The ExpressCard standard specifies voltages of either 1.5 V or 3.3 V; CardBus slots can use 3.3 V or 5.0 V. The ExpressCard FAQ claims lower cost, better scalability, and better integration with motherboard chipset technology than Cardbus. PCMCIA devices can be connected to an ExpressCard slot via an adapter.

When the PC Card was introduced, the only other way to connect peripherals to a laptop computer was via RS-232 and parallel ports of limited performance, so it was widely adopted for many peripherals. More recently, virtually all laptop equipment has 480 Mbit/s Hi-Speed USB 2.0 ports, and most types of peripheral which formerly used a PC Card connection are available for USB or are built-in, making the ExpressCard less necessary than the PC Card was in its day. Many laptop computers do not have an ExpressCard slot.

==Availability==

An ExpressCard slot was commonly included on high-end laptops from the mid 2000s to the early 2010s:
* Hewlett-Packard began shipping systems with ExpressCard in November 2004.
* Lenovo integrated the slot into their flagship ThinkPad T43 in May 2005.
* Dell Computer also incorporates this in their Precision (the 17 in models have them exclusively, the 15 in Precisions have both express card and PCMCIA Card slots), Inspiron, Latitude (Latitude D-series have PCMCIA card slots. The D820/D830 have both ExpressCard and PCMCIA card slots. Latitude E-Series 6000 have ExpressCard|54 slots), Studio, Vostro and XPS Laptop product lines.
* Fujitsu-Siemens began shipping systems with ExpressCard in mid-2005.
* Apple Inc. included single ExpressCard/34 slots in every MacBook Pro notebook computer from January 2006 through June 2009. At the June 8, 2009 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference the company announced that the 15-inch and 13-inch MacBook Pro models would replace the ExpressCard slot with a Secure Digital card slot, while retaining the ExpressCard slot on the 17-inch model. In June 2012 Apple discontinued the 17-inch model and no further Macbooks have offered an ExpressCard slot.
* , ASUS had also replaced the PC Card slot with an ExpressCard slot on many of its new models.
* Sony also began shipping systems with ExpressCard with its new laptop VGN-C, VGN-SZ, VGN-NS, VPC and FW product line.
* The Acer Aspire laptop series also had a single ExpressCard/54 slot on most new models.
* , Panasonic incorporated ExpressCard/54 slots in all the fully rugged and semi-rugged models of their Toughbook brand of laptop computers.
* , Gateway notebooks (ML3109 and later) also shipped with ExpressCard/54 interfaces.

Because of the lack of backward compatibility, some laptop manufacturers initially released models incorporating both CardBus (PCMCIA, PC Card) and ExpressCard slots. These included certain models of Acer Aspire, Acer Extensa, Toshiba Satellite, Dell Latitude and Precision, MSI S42x and Lenovo ThinkPad Z60m, R52, T60, R61 and T61.

In March 2005, the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) showed some of the first ExpressCard products at the CeBIT trade show in Germany. A large number of ExpressCard devices were presented.

In November 2006, Belkin announced that it was launching the first ExpressCard docking station, which uses the PCIe part of an ExpressCard connection to enable 1600x1200 video and the USB part to provide USB, audio and network ports. This points to the ability for ExpressCard to allow more capable non-OEM docking stations for laptop computers.

In 2007, Sony introduced its Vaio TZ model, which incorporates ExpressCards. Also the Sony Vaio FZ and Vaio Z series have the ExpressCard/34 Slot integrated in them. Sony also uses the ExpressCard/34 form factor for the flash memory modules in its XDCAM EX/SxS based camcorders, making the copying of video data between these cameras and ExpressCard-equipped laptops easier. For this reason, Sony also offers a USB-based SxS reader for desktop computers.

The Toshiba Satellite P and X 200/205 series of laptops and desktop replacements have an ExpressCard/34 slot since April 2007. In P200 series it&#x27;s a /54 size not /34.

Ever since PCMCIA disbanded in 2009, newer laptops from 2010 on more commonly do not include ExpressCard slots except for some business-oriented models (e.g. some Lenovo models use it for supporting a smart card reader). For WWAN connectivity cards, either mini-PCIe slots or USB connected variants have become the preferred connection methods. For external desktop graphics card enclosures and other peripherals that interface with PCI Express, Thunderbolt has supplanted ExpressCard in that role due to its faster speed and ability to use multiple PCIe 2.0 lanes; the first and second Thunderbolt revisions offered 20 Gbit/s of maximum bandwidth with four PCIe 2.0 lanes while ExpressCard could only muster 5 Gbit/s maximum with one PCIe 2.0 lane.

==ExpressCard 2.0==
The ExpressCard 2.0 standard was introduced on March 4, 2009, at CeBIT in Hannover. It provides a single PCIe 1.0 2.5 GT/s lane (optionally PCIe 2.0 with 5 GT/s) and a USB 3.0 &quot;SuperSpeed&quot; link with a raw transfer speed of 5 Gbit/s (effective transfer speed up to 400 MB/s). It is forward and backward compatible with earlier ExpressCard modules and slots. USB 3.0 SuperSpeed compatibility is achieved by sharing the pins with the PCIe link. An inserted card signals which mode should be used.

The standard failed to gain widespread use and some Taiwanese manufacturers discontinued it as early as 2011. After the dissolution of the PCMCIA in 2010, the specification, associated documentation and licensing responsibilities were moved to the USB Implementers Forum. The specifications were last revised in 2009, and removed from their website in 2018.

<doc id="644917" wikidata="Q1436775" url="?curid=644917" title="Ford Corsair">
<text>The name Ford Corsair was used both for a car produced by Ford of Britain between 1963 and 1970, and for an unrelated Nissan-based automobile marketed by Ford Australia between 1989 and 1992.

==Ford Consul Corsair (1963–1965), Ford Corsair V4 (1965–1970) – Britain==
The Ford Consul Corsair (later known simply as the Ford Corsair), manufactured by Ford UK, is a midsized car that was introduced at the London Motor Show in October 1963 and available as either a saloon or estate from 1964 until 1970. Also, a convertible version was built by Crayford Engineering, which is now very rare and highly sought-after as a classic. Two-door Corsair saloons are also rare, being built only to order in the UK, although two-doors were produced in quantity for some export markets. The Consul Corsair S was an export-only model with a two-door Deluxe body and 1500GT engine, sold in Austria and Sweden, and also in South Africa as the Corsair 83. Only one example of the fleet model, the Consul Corsair Standard, is known to survive. Unlike the Ford Cortina which had five versions (Mks), or the Ford Capri which had face-lifts, the entire production run of the Ford Corsair was a consistent Mk 1, with the body remaining the same, and the design changes being confined to the interior, engine, and mechanicals.

The Corsair was designed by the same team as the Mark 1 Cortina, with Roy Brown Jr. overseeing the styling by Charles Thompson, and Fred Hart in charge of the engineering. Replacing the Consul Classic range, it was essentially a long wheelbase re-skinned Cortina with extra soundproofing and more comfortable seating for high speed long-distance driving. The windscreen and side windows are shared with the Cortina, the mechanical components with the Cortina GT, and the body&#x27;s internal panels are basically similar. The Corsair had unusual and quite bold styling for its day, with a sharp horizontal V-shaped crease at the very front of the car into which round headlights were inset. This gave the car a relatively aerodynamic shape; the top speed of the Corsair 1500 was higher than the equivalent Cortina 1500 even though the Corsair was slightly larger and heavier. The jet-like styling extended to the rear where sharply pointed vertical light clusters hinted at fins, recalling the Ford Consul Mark 2. The overall styling theme was shared with the early 1960s Ford Thunderbird; both cars were inspired by Uwe Bahnsen&#x27;s design for the 1960 Ford Taunus P3, but the Corsair was an economical medium-sized motorway cruiser with smooth light-weight bodywork, and very like the Taunus in concept.

In 1964 Tony Brookes, with his twin brother as one of the drivers, and a group of friends captured 15 International class G World endurance records at Monza in Italy with a Corsair 1500 GT. (Monza Yearbook 1965)

The Corsair Deluxe was initially offered with the larger , single-carburettor, 1.5 L Kent engine that was also used in the smaller Cortina, and the Corsair GT came with the same , 1.5-litre engine as the Cortina GT. The car received positive reviews from motoring journalists, with some reservations about the dash layout and the closeness of the steering wheel to the driver. Although the 1963-65 Corsair range outsold the Classic, the car was not a best-seller like the Cortina, but given the low development costs it was presumed to be profitable for Ford. The range was revised in September 1965, gaining a better dashboard and interior ventilation, but adopting new Ford Essex V4 engines which were rough at idle and coarse on the road. The Essex engine was made in capacity for the Corsair V4 Deluxe, and a 2.0-litre version with high fuel consumption and disappointing performance was installed in the Corsair V4 GT. One marketing tagline for the V4 models was &quot;The Car That Is Seen But Not Heard&quot;, which was a real stretch of the ad man&#x27;s puff, given the inherent characteristics of the engine. The other tag was &quot;I&#x27;ve got a V in my bonnet&quot;. These V4 engined cars were poorly regarded by the public, and sales began to taper off. In January 1967 a much improved version of the 2.0 L engine was released, and in April 1967 the problematic V4 GT was replaced by the 2000E model. A 3.0-litre conversion using the Ford Essex V6 engine was one of the options available via Crayford Engineering.

 Ford Corsair production data:


Two-door Corsairs were almost all LHD cars, &lt;br&gt;destined for Europe/export.
An estate car by Abbott was added to the range on the eve of the Geneva Motor Show in March 1966, and in 1967, the Corsair underwent the Executive treatment like its smaller Cortina sibling, resulting in the 2000E model with dechromed flanks, which necessitated non-styled-in door handles, special wheel trims, reversing lights, a vinyl roof, and upgraded cabin fittings including a polished wood dashboard. The 2000E, priced at £1,008 in 1967, was positioned as a cut price alternative to the Rover 2000, the introduction of which had effectively defined a new market segment for four cylinder executive sedans in the UK three years earlier: the Corsair 2000E comfortably undercut the £1,357 Rover 2000 and the £1,047 Humber Sceptre.

A five-seater convertible and a four-seater cabriolet conversion were available via Crayford Engineering. Only 18 Cabriolets were built, using technology from the Karl Deutsch GmbH in Germany. Only four are known to survive. 

The Corsair&#x27;s performance was good for a car of its type and period, with a top speed in its later 2.0 L V4 version of as measured by the speedometer, thanks to the progressive 28/36mm twin-choke Weber downdraught carburettor.

The Corsair was replaced by the Mk 3 Cortina in 1970, when the enlarged Cortina became Ford&#x27;s midsized car, and a new smaller model, the Escort, had already filled in the size below. The new Ford Capri took on the performance and sporty aspirations of the company.

Over its six-year production, 310,000 Corsairs were built, of which about 600 are thought to survive in the UK as of 2019. Conversely, of the 200 convertibles built, around 75 have survived.

The Corsair was also manufactured by Ford in Ireland and South Africa. A small number of Corsairs were exported to Australia and New Zealand. 
== Ford Corsair (UA, Australia) ==
Between 1989 and 1992, the Ford Corsair name was used by Ford Australia for a badge-engineered version of the Nissan Pintara (a version of the Bluebird).

Known during development as &#x27;Project Matilda&#x27;, the Corsair was produced under a model-sharing scheme known as the Button Plan. It was offered as a four-door sedan and as a five-door liftback, in GL and Ghia trim levels with 2.0 L (CA20E) and 2.4 L (KA24E) four-cylinder engines.

The Corsair was intended to replace the Mazda 626-based Ford Telstar, which was imported from Japan. The two were sold side by side in the Australian Ford range, with the Telstar only available as the high-performance TX5 hatchback. However, it proved less popular than the Telstar had been, losing sales dramatically during 1991.

When Nissan closed its Australian plant in 1992, the Corsair was discontinued and the imported Telstar once again became Ford&#x27;s main offering in the midsized segment, until being replaced by the Mondeo in 1995.

==Edsel Corsair==
The unrelated Edsel Corsair was produced by the former Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln Division of the Ford Motor Company in the United States and sold under its Edsel marque in 1958 and 1959.

<doc id="644921" wikidata="Q907926" url="?curid=644921" title="Holonomy">
<text>In differential geometry, the holonomy of a connection on a smooth manifold is the extent to which parallel transport around closed loops fails to preserve the geometrical data being transported. Holonomy is a general geometrical consequence of the curvature of the connection. For flat connections, the associated holonomy is a type of monodromy and is an inherently global notion. For curved connections, holonomy has nontrivial local and global features.

Any kind of connection on a manifold gives rise, through its parallel transport maps, to some notion of holonomy. The most common forms of holonomy are for connections possessing some kind of symmetry. Important examples include: holonomy of the Levi-Civita connection in Riemannian geometry (called Riemannian holonomy), holonomy of connections in vector bundles, holonomy of Cartan connections, and holonomy of connections in principal bundles. In each of these cases, the holonomy of the connection can be identified with a Lie group, the holonomy group. The holonomy of a connection is closely related to the curvature of the connection, via the &quot;Ambrose–Singer theorem&quot;.

The study of Riemannian holonomy has led to a number of important developments. Holonomy was introduced by in order to study and classify symmetric spaces. It was not until much later that holonomy groups would be used to study Riemannian geometry in a more general setting. In 1952 Georges de Rham proved the &quot;de Rham decomposition theorem&quot;, a principle for splitting a Riemannian manifold into a Cartesian product of Riemannian manifolds by splitting the tangent bundle into irreducible spaces under the action of the local holonomy groups. Later, in 1953, Marcel Berger classified the possible irreducible holonomies. The decomposition and classification of Riemannian holonomy has applications to physics and to string theory.

==Definitions==

===Holonomy of a connection in a vector bundle===
Let &quot;E&quot; be a rank-&quot;k&quot; vector bundle over a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, and let ∇ be a connection on &quot;E&quot;. Given a piecewise smooth loop &quot;γ&quot; : [0,1] → &quot;M&quot; based at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, the connection defines a parallel transport map &quot;P&quot;&quot;γ&quot; : &quot;Ex&quot; → &quot;Ex&quot; on the fiber of &quot;E&quot; at &quot;x&quot;. This map is both linear and invertible, and so defines an element of the general linear group GL(&quot;Ex&quot;). The holonomy group of ∇ based at &quot;x&quot; is defined as

:formula_1

The restricted holonomy group based at &quot;x&quot; is the subgroup formula_2 coming from contractible loops &quot;γ&quot;.

If &quot;M&quot; is connected, then the holonomy group depends on the basepoint &quot;x&quot; only up to conjugation in GL(&quot;k&quot;, R). Explicitly, if &quot;γ&quot; is a path from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, then

:formula_3

Choosing different identifications of &quot;Ex&quot; with R&quot;k&quot; also gives conjugate subgroups. Sometimes, particularly in general or informal discussions (such as below), one may drop reference to the basepoint, with the understanding that the definition is good up to conjugation.

Some important properties of the holonomy group include:
* formula_4 is a connected Lie subgroup of GL(&quot;k&quot;, R).
* formula_4 is the identity component of formula_6
* There is a natural, surjective group homomorphism formula_7 where formula_8 is the fundamental group of &quot;M&quot;, which sends the homotopy class formula_9 to the coset formula_10
* If &quot;M&quot; is simply connected, then formula_11
* ∇ is flat (i.e. has vanishing curvature) if and only if formula_4 is trivial.
===Holonomy of a connection in a principal bundle===
The definition for holonomy of connections on principal bundles proceeds in parallel fashion. Let &quot;G&quot; be a Lie group and &quot;P&quot; a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle over a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; which is paracompact. Let ω be a connection on &quot;P&quot;. Given a piecewise smooth loop &quot;γ&quot; : [0,1] → &quot;M&quot; based at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot; and a point &quot;p&quot; in the fiber over &quot;x&quot;, the connection defines a unique &quot;horizontal lift&quot; formula_13 such that formula_14 The end point of the horizontal lift, formula_15, will not generally be &quot;p&quot; but rather some other point &quot;p&quot;·&quot;g&quot; in the fiber over &quot;x&quot;. Define an equivalence relation ~ on &quot;P&quot; by saying that &quot;p&quot; ~ &quot;q&quot; if they can be joined by a piecewise smooth horizontal path in &quot;P&quot;.

The holonomy group of ω based at &quot;p&quot; is then defined as

:formula_16

The restricted holonomy group based at &quot;p&quot; is the subgroup formula_17 coming from horizontal lifts of contractible loops &quot;γ&quot;.

If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are connected then the holonomy group depends on the basepoint &quot;p&quot; only up to conjugation in &quot;G&quot;. Explicitly, if &quot;q&quot; is any other chosen basepoint for the holonomy, then there exists a unique &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;q&quot; ~ &quot;p&quot;·&quot;g&quot;. With this value of &quot;g&quot;,

:formula_18

In particular,

:formula_19

Moreover, if &quot;p&quot; ~ &quot;q&quot; then formula_20 As above, sometimes one drops reference to the basepoint of the holonomy group, with the understanding that the definition is good up to conjugation.

Some important properties of the holonomy and restricted holonomy groups include:

*formula_17 is a connected Lie subgroup of &quot;G&quot;.
*formula_17 is the identity component of formula_23
*There is a natural, surjective group homomorphism formula_24
*If &quot;M&quot; is simply connected then formula_25
*ω is flat (i.e. has vanishing curvature) if and only if formula_17 is trivial.

===Holonomy bundles===
Let &quot;M&quot; be a connected paracompact smooth manifold and &quot;P&quot; a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle with connection ω, as above. Let &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;P&quot; be an arbitrary point of the principal bundle. Let &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) be the set of points in &quot;P&quot; which can be joined to &quot;p&quot; by a horizontal curve. Then it can be shown that &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;), with the evident projection map, is a principal bundle over &quot;M&quot; with structure group formula_23 This principal bundle is called the holonomy bundle (through &quot;p&quot;) of the connection. The connection ω restricts to a connection on &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;), since its parallel transport maps preserve &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;). Thus &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is a reduced bundle for the connection. Furthermore, since no subbundle of &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is preserved by parallel transport, it is the minimal such reduction.

As with the holonomy groups, the holonomy bundle also transforms equivariantly within the ambient principal bundle &quot;P&quot;. In detail, if &quot;q&quot; ∈ &quot;P&quot; is another chosen basepoint for the holonomy, then there exists a unique &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;q&quot; ~ &quot;p&quot; &quot;g&quot; (since, by assumption, &quot;M&quot; is path-connected). Hence &quot;H&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) = &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) &quot;g&quot;. As a consequence, the induced connections on holonomy bundles corresponding to different choices of basepoint are compatible with one another: their parallel transport maps will differ by precisely the same element &quot;g&quot;.

===Monodromy===
The holonomy bundle &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is a principal bundle for formula_28 and so also admits an action of the restricted holonomy group formula_17 (which is a normal subgroup of the full holonomy group). The discrete group formula_30 is called the monodromy group of the connection; it acts on the quotient bundle formula_31 There is a surjective homomorphism formula_32 so that formula_33 acts on formula_31 This action of the fundamental group is a monodromy representation of the fundamental group.

===Local and infinitesimal holonomy===
If π: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;M&quot; is a principal bundle, and ω is a connection in &quot;P&quot;, then the holonomy of ω can be restricted to the fibre over an open subset of &quot;M&quot;. Indeed, if &quot;U&quot; is a connected open subset of &quot;M&quot;, then ω restricts to give a connection in the bundle π−1&quot;U&quot; over &quot;U&quot;. The holonomy (resp. restricted holonomy) of this bundle will be denoted by formula_35 (resp. formula_36) for each &quot;p&quot; with π(&quot;p&quot;) ∈ &quot;U&quot;.

If &quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;V&quot; are two open sets containing π(&quot;p&quot;), then there is an evident inclusion

:formula_37

The local holonomy group at a point &quot;p&quot; is defined by

:formula_38

for any family of nested connected open sets &quot;U&quot;&quot;k&quot; with formula_39.

The local holonomy group has the following properties:

# It is a connected Lie subgroup of the restricted holonomy group formula_40
# Every point &quot;p&quot; has a neighborhood &quot;V&quot; such that formula_41 In particular, the local holonomy group depends only on the point &quot;p&quot;, and not the choice of sequence &quot;U&quot;&quot;k&quot; used to define it.
# The local holonomy is equivariant with respect to translation by elements of the structure group &quot;G&quot; of &quot;P&quot;; i.e., formula_42 for all &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;. (Note that, by property 1, the local holonomy group is a connected Lie subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, so the adjoint is well-defined.)

The local holonomy group is not well-behaved as a global object. In particular, its dimension may fail to be constant. However, the following theorem holds:

: If the dimension of the local holonomy group is constant, then the local and restricted holonomy agree: formula_43

==Ambrose–Singer theorem==
The Ambrose–Singer theorem (due to ) relates the holonomy of a connection in a principal bundle with the curvature form of the connection. To make this theorem plausible, consider the familiar case of an affine connection (or a connection in the tangent bundle the Levi-Civita connection, for example). The curvature arises when one travels around an infinitesimal parallelogram.

In detail, if σ: [0, 1] × [0, 1] → &quot;M&quot; is a surface in &quot;M&quot; parametrized by a pair of variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, then a vector &quot;V&quot; may be transported around the boundary of σ: first along (&quot;x&quot;, 0), then along (1, &quot;y&quot;), followed by (&quot;x&quot;, 1) going in the negative direction, and then (0, &quot;y&quot;) back to the point of origin. This is a special case of a holonomy loop: the vector &quot;V&quot; is acted upon by the holonomy group element corresponding to the lift of the boundary of σ. The curvature enters explicitly when the parallelogram is shrunk to zero, by traversing the boundary of smaller parallelograms over [0, &quot;x&quot;] × [0, &quot;y&quot;]. This corresponds to taking a derivative of the parallel transport maps at &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 0:

:formula_44

where &quot;R&quot; is the curvature tensor. So, roughly speaking, the curvature gives the infinitesimal holonomy over a closed loop (the infinitesimal parallelogram). More formally, the curvature is the differential of the holonomy action at the identity of the holonomy group. In other words, &quot;R&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) is an element of the Lie algebra of formula_23

In general, consider the holonomy of a connection in a principal bundle &quot;P&quot; → &quot;M&quot; over &quot;P&quot; with structure group &quot;G&quot;. Let g denote the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;, the curvature form of the connection is a g-valued 2-form Ω on &quot;P&quot;. The Ambrose–Singer theorem states:

:The Lie algebra of formula_46 is spanned by all the elements of g of the form formula_47 as &quot;q&quot; ranges over all points which can be joined to &quot;p&quot; by a horizontal curve (&quot;q&quot; ~ &quot;p&quot;), and &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are horizontal tangent vectors at &quot;q&quot;.

Alternatively, the theorem can be restated in terms of the holonomy bundle:

:The Lie algebra of formula_46 is the subspace of g spanned by elements of the form formula_49 where &quot;q&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) and &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are horizontal vectors at &quot;q&quot;.

==Riemannian holonomy==
The holonomy of a Riemannian manifold (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) is the holonomy group of the Levi-Civita connection on the tangent bundle to &quot;M&quot;. A &#x27;generic&#x27; &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold has an O(&quot;n&quot;) holonomy, or SO(&quot;n&quot;) if it is orientable. Manifolds whose holonomy groups are proper subgroups of O(&quot;n&quot;) or SO(&quot;n&quot;) have special properties.

One of the earliest fundamental results on Riemannian holonomy is the theorem of , which asserts that the restricted holonomy group is a closed Lie subgroup of O(&quot;n&quot;). In particular, it is compact.

===Reducible holonomy and the de Rham decomposition===
Let &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot; be an arbitrary point. Then the holonomy group Hol(&quot;M&quot;) acts on the tangent space Tx&quot;M&quot;. This action may either be irreducible as a group representation, or reducible in the sense that there is a splitting of Tx&quot;M&quot; into orthogonal subspaces Tx&quot;M&quot; = T′x&quot;M&quot; ⊕ T″x&quot;M&quot;, each of which is invariant under the action of Hol(&quot;M&quot;). In the latter case, &quot;M&quot; is said to be reducible.

Suppose that &quot;M&quot; is a reducible manifold. Allowing the point &quot;x&quot; to vary, the bundles T′&quot;M&quot; and T″&quot;M&quot; formed by the reduction of the tangent space at each point are smooth distributions which are integrable in the sense of Frobenius. The integral manifolds of these distributions are totally geodesic submanifolds. So &quot;M&quot; is locally a Cartesian product &quot;M′&quot; × &quot;M″&quot;. The (local) de Rham isomorphism follows by continuing this process until a complete reduction of the tangent space is achieved:

: Let &quot;M&quot; be a simply connected Riemannian manifold, and T&quot;M&quot; = T(0)&quot;M&quot; ⊕ T(1)&quot;M&quot; ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ T(&quot;k&quot;)&quot;M&quot; be the complete reduction of the tangent bundle under the action of the holonomy group. Suppose that T(0)&quot;M&quot; consists of vectors invariant under the holonomy group (i.e., such that the holonomy representation is trivial). Then locally &quot;M&quot; is isometric to a product
:: formula_50
: where &quot;V&quot;0 is an open set in a Euclidean space, and each &quot;Vi&quot; is an integral manifold for T(&quot;i&quot;)&quot;M&quot;. Furthermore, Hol(&quot;M&quot;) splits as a direct product of the holonomy groups of each &quot;Mi&quot;, the maximal integral manifold of T(&quot;i&quot;) through a point.

If, moreover, &quot;M&quot; is assumed to be geodesically complete, then the theorem holds globally, and each &quot;Mi&quot; is a geodesically complete manifold.

===The Berger classification===
In 1955, M. Berger gave a complete classification of possible holonomy groups for simply connected, Riemannian manifolds which are irreducible (not locally a product space) and nonsymmetric (not locally a Riemannian symmetric space). Berger&#x27;s list is as follows:

Manifolds with holonomy Sp(&quot;n&quot;)·Sp(1) were simultaneously studied in 1965 by Edmond Bonan and Vivian Yoh Kraines,
who both discovered that such manifolds would necessarily carry a parallel 4-form.

Manifolds with holonomy G2 or Spin(7) were first investigated in abstract by Edmond Bonan in 1966, who classified the parallel differential forms that such a manifold would carry, and showed that such a manifold would necessarily be Ricci-flat. However, no examples such manifolds would actually be constructed for another 30 years. 

Berger&#x27;s original list also included the possibility of Spin(9) as a subgroup of SO(16). Riemannian manifolds with such holonomy were later shown independently by D. Alekseevski and Brown-Gray to be necessarily locally symmetric, i.e., locally isometric to the Cayley plane F4/Spin(9) or locally flat. See below.) It is now known that all of these possibilities occur as holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds. The last two exceptional cases were the most difficult to find. See G2 manifold and Spin(7) manifold.

Note that Sp(&quot;n&quot;) ⊂ SU(2&quot;n&quot;) ⊂ U(2&quot;n&quot;) ⊂ SO(4&quot;n&quot;), so every hyperkähler manifold is a Calabi–Yau manifold, every Calabi–Yau manifold is a Kähler manifold, and every Kähler manifold is orientable.

The strange list above was explained by Simons&#x27;s proof of Berger&#x27;s theorem. A simple and geometric proof of Berger&#x27;s theorem was given by Carlos E. Olmos in 2005. One first shows that if a Riemannian manifold is &quot;not&quot; a locally symmetric space and the reduced holonomy acts irreducibly on the tangent space, then it acts transitively on the unit sphere. The Lie groups acting transitively on spheres are known: they consist of the list above, together with 2 extra cases: the group Spin(9) acting on R16, and the group &quot;T&quot; · Sp(&quot;m&quot;) acting on R4&quot;m&quot;. Finally one checks that the first of these two extra cases only occurs as a holonomy group for locally symmetric spaces (that are locally isomorphic to the Cayley projective plane), and the second does not occur at all as a holonomy group.

Berger&#x27;s original classification also included non-positive-definite pseudo-Riemannian metric non-locally symmetric holonomy. That list consisted of SO(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) of signature (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), U(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) and SU(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) of signature (2&quot;p&quot;, 2&quot;q&quot;), Sp(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) and Sp(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;)·Sp(1) of signature (4&quot;p&quot;, 4&quot;q&quot;), SO(&quot;n&quot;, C) of signature (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot;), SO(&quot;n&quot;, H) of signature (2&quot;n&quot;, 2&quot;n&quot;), split G2 of signature (4, 3), G2(C) of signature (7, 7), Spin(4, 3) of signature (4, 4), Spin(7, C) of signature (7,7), Spin(5,4) of signature (8,8) and, lastly, Spin(9, C) of signature (16,16). The split and complexified Spin(9) are necessarily locally symmetric as above and should not have been on the list. The complexified holonomies SO(&quot;n&quot;, C), G2(C), and Spin(7,C) may be realized from complexifying real analytic Riemannian manifolds. The last case, manifolds with holonomy contained in SO(&quot;n&quot;, H), were shown to be locally flat by R. McLean.

Riemannian symmetric spaces, which are locally isometric to homogeneous spaces &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; have local holonomy isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;. These too have been completely classified.

Finally, Berger&#x27;s paper lists possible holonomy groups of manifolds with only a torsion-free affine connection; this is discussed below.

===Special holonomy and spinors===
Manifolds with special holonomy are characterized by the presence of parallel spinors, meaning spinor fields with vanishing covariant derivative. In particular, the following facts hold:
* Hol(ω) ⊂ &quot;U&quot;(n) if and only if &quot;M&quot; admits a covariantly constant (or &quot;parallel&quot;) projective pure spinor field.
* If &quot;M&quot; is a spin manifold, then Hol(ω) ⊂ &quot;SU&quot;(n) if and only if &quot;M&quot; admits at least two linearly independent parallel pure spinor fields. In fact, a parallel pure spinor field determines a canonical reduction of the structure group to &quot;SU&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).
* If &quot;M&quot; is a seven-dimensional spin manifold, then &quot;M&quot; carries a non-trivial parallel spinor field if and only if the holonomy is contained in G2.
* If &quot;M&quot; is an eight-dimensional spin manifold, then &quot;M&quot; carries a non-trivial parallel spinor field if and only if the holonomy is contained in Spin(7).
The unitary and special unitary holonomies are often studied in connection with twistor theory, as well as in the study of almost complex structures.

===Applications===

====String Theory====
Riemannian manifolds with special holonomy play an important role in string theory compactifications.

This is because special holonomy manifolds admit covariantly constant (parallel) spinors and thus preserve some fraction of the original supersymmetry. Most important are compactifications on Calabi–Yau manifolds with SU(2) or SU(3) holonomy. Also important are compactifications on G2 manifolds.

====Machine Learning====
Computing the holonomy of Riemannian manifolds has been suggested as a way to learn the structure of data manifolds in machine learning, in particular in the context of manifold learning. As the holonomy group contains information about the global structure of the data manifold, it can be used to identify how the data manifold might decompose into a product of submanifolds. The holonomy cannot be computed exactly due to finite sampling effects, but it is possible to construct a numerical approximation using ideas from spectral graph theory similar to Vector Diffusion Maps. The resulting algorithm, the Geometric Manifold Component Estimator () gives a numerical approximation to the de Rham decomposition that can be applied to real-world data.

==Affine holonomy==
Affine holonomy groups are the groups arising as holonomies of torsion-free affine connections; those which are not Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian holonomy groups are also known as non-metric holonomy groups. The de Rham decomposition theorem does not apply to affine holonomy groups, so a complete classification is out of reach. However, it is still natural to classify irreducible affine holonomies.

On the way to his classification of Riemannian holonomy groups, Berger developed two criteria that must be satisfied by the Lie algebra of the holonomy group of a torsion-free affine connection which is not locally symmetric: one of them, known as &quot;Berger&#x27;s first criterion&quot;, is a consequence of the Ambrose–Singer theorem, that the curvature generates the holonomy algebra; the other, known as &quot;Berger&#x27;s second criterion&quot;, comes from the requirement that the connection should not be locally symmetric. Berger presented a list of groups acting irreducibly and satisfying these two criteria; this can be interpreted as a list of possibilities for irreducible affine holonomies.

Berger&#x27;s list was later shown to be incomplete: further examples were found by R. Bryant (1991) and by Q. Chi, S. Merkulov, and L. Schwachhöfer (1996). These are sometimes known as &quot;exotic holonomies&quot;. The search for examples ultimately led to a complete classification of irreducible affine holonomies by Merkulov and Schwachhöfer (1999), with Bryant (2000) showing that every group on their list occurs as an affine holonomy group.

The Merkulov–Schwachhöfer classification has been clarified considerably by a connection between the groups on the list and certain symmetric spaces, namely the hermitian symmetric spaces and the quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces. The relationship is particularly clear in the case of complex affine holonomies, as demonstrated by Schwachhöfer (2001).

Let &quot;V&quot; be a finite-dimensional complex vector space, let &quot;H&quot; ⊂ Aut(&quot;V&quot;) be an irreducible semisimple complex connected Lie subgroup and let &quot;K&quot; ⊂ &quot;H&quot; be a maximal compact subgroup.
# If there is an irreducible hermitian symmetric space of the form &quot;G&quot;/(U(1) · &quot;K&quot;), then both &quot;H&quot; and C*· &quot;H&quot; are non-symmetric irreducible affine holonomy groups, where &quot;V&quot; the tangent representation of &quot;K&quot;.
# If there is an irreducible quaternion-Kähler symmetric space of the form &quot;G&quot;/(Sp(1) · &quot;K&quot;), then &quot;H&quot; is a non-symmetric irreducible affine holonomy groups, as is C* · &quot;H&quot; if dim &quot;V&quot; = 4. Here the complexified tangent representation of Sp(1) · &quot;K&quot; is C2 ⊗ &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;H&quot; preserves a complex symplectic form on &quot;V&quot;.
These two families yield all non-symmetric irreducible complex affine holonomy groups apart from the following:
:formula_51

Using the classification of hermitian symmetric spaces, the first family gives the following complex affine holonomy groups:
:formula_52
where &quot;Z&quot;C is either trivial, or the group C*.

Using the classification of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces, the second family gives the following complex symplectic holonomy groups:
:formula_53
(In the second row, &quot;Z&quot;C must be trivial unless &quot;n&quot; = 2.)

From these lists, an analogue of Simons&#x27;s result that Riemannian holonomy groups act transitively on spheres may be observed: the complex holonomy representations are all prehomogeneous vector spaces. A conceptual proof of this fact is not known.

The classification of irreducible real affine holonomies can be obtained from a careful analysis, using the lists above and the fact that real affine holonomies complexify to complex ones.

==Etymology==
There is a similar word, &quot;holomorphic&quot;, that was introduced by two of Cauchy&#x27;s students, Briot (1817–1882) and Bouquet (1819–1895), and derives from the Greek (&quot;holos&quot;) meaning &quot;entire&quot;, and (&quot;morphē&quot;) meaning &quot;form&quot; or &quot;appearance&quot;.
The etymology of &quot;holonomy&quot; shares the first part with &quot;holomorphic&quot; (&quot;holos&quot;). About the second part:

<text>Loyalhanna Creek is a long tributary of the Kiskiminetas River in Westmoreland County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The stream is a popular destination for canoeing and recreational trout fishing.

== Etymology ==

The creek derives its name from the eighteenth-century village of Layalhanning, an important Delaware Indian crossroads settlement located at the site where Fort Ligonier was built, in present Ligonier, Pennsylvania. The village was settled shortly after the Delaware left the Susquehanna River area in 1727. Layalhanning means &quot;the middle stream&quot; in the Delaware language— &quot;lawel&quot; or &quot;lawell&quot; (middle); &quot;hanna&quot; (a river or stream); &quot;ing&quot; (at the place of).

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as: 
* Leyelhanna Creek
* Loyal Hanna Creek

== Course ==

Loyalhanna rises from Laurel Ridge in southeastern Westmoreland County, north of Donegal and flows NNE, along the southeastern side of Chestnut Ridge. Approximately 5 mi (8 km) northwest of Ligonier it turns northwest, cutting through Chestnut Ridge and passing through Latrobe. From Latrobe, it flows NNW, passing through Loyalhanna Lake reservoir and joins with the Conemaugh River to form the Kiskiminetas River at Saltsburg. The creek lies about midway between the Juniata River to the east and the Ohio River to the west, and about halfway between the Conemaugh River to the north and the Youghiogheny River to the south.

== Watershed ==

Decades before the 2000s, the lower end of the creek, beginning above Latrobe, was colored red due to acid from local mines. Rocks in the area are still stained red from the effects. In subsequent years, with the growth of environmental sensitivity, a remediation pond was installed near Saint Vincent College that removes 90 percent of the iron oxide from the water.

== Claims of Bigfoot sightings ==

Sam Sherry, of Wilpen, claimed to have encountered a Bigfoot while night fishing along Loyalhanna Creek on May 17, 1987. Sherry gained notice from Bigfoot enthusiasts and spent much of his life investigating the phenomenon in the area.

<text>Regierungsbezirk Breslau, known colloquially as Middle Silesia (; ; ), was a &quot;Regierungsbezirk,&quot; or government region, in the Prussian Province of Silesia and later Lower Silesia from 1813 to 1945. It comprised the eastern parts of the historic Lower Silesia region and the former County of Kladsko, both of which were conquered by Prussia in the First Silesian War in 1742.

==History==
Silesia had been part of Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy until most of it was ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Silesian War, codified by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau. In 1813, the administrative &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; was established in Prussian Silesia, with its capital in Breslau (present-day Wrocław). The western half of Lower Silesia was incorporated into &quot;Regierungsbezirk Liegnitz&quot; (Legnica), the adjacent Upper Silesian land in the east into &quot;Regierungsbezirk Oppeln&quot; (Opole).

After the short-lived &quot;Regierungsbezirk Reichenbach&quot; (Dzierżoniów) was dissolved in 1820, the Middle Silesian district also comprised Glatzer Land (Kłodzko Land) in the south and several districts of the former duchies of Münsterberg (Ziębice), Jauer (Jawor) and Brieg (Brzeg). It then stretched from the Greater Polish plain in the north (Grand Duchy of Posen/Province of Posen) to the border with Bohemia along the Sudetes mountain range in the south, where Glatzer Land also bordered on Austrian Silesia in the east. After World War I, the state of Czechoslovakia arose on the southern border, while Greater Poland in the north became part of the Second Polish Republic. At the same time, the Prussian Province of Silesia was divided, whereby &quot;Regierungsbezirk Breslau&quot; formed the eastern half of the Province of Lower Silesia. According to the Treaty of Versailles, small parts of Regierungsbezirk Breslau lying along the border with Greater Poland had to be ceded to Poland and became part of the Poznań Voivodeship. This included significant parts of the Groß Wartenberg and Namslau districts, which was known as the Reichthaler Ländchen. After World War II, the whole region became part of Poland, as the Soviet Union expanded its borders and moved Poland westward under the terms of the 1945 Potsdam Agreement. By 1949, almost the entire indigenous German population was expelled.

Today, the region forms the eastern part of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship and the north-western part of the Opole Voivodeship and also includes a small southern part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

==Ethnolinguistic structure==
In 1819, Regierungsbezirk Breslau had 833,253 inhabitants: 755,553 Germans (90.1%); 66,500 Poles (7.9%); 3,900 Czechs (1.1%) and 7,300 Jews (0.9%). The United States Immigration Commission in 1911 classified Polish-speaking Silesians as ethnic Poles.

According to the Prussian census of 1861, Regierungsbezirk Breslau had a population of 1,278,064, of which 1,217,102 (95.2%) spoke German, 53,479 (4.2%) spoke Polish and 7,483 (0.6%) spoke Czech.

By 1905, all districts were majority German-speaking, with the highest concentration of Polish speakers being found in the districts of Groß Wartenberg and Namslau where they (including bilinguals) constituted 42.9% and 27.4% of the population respectively.

==Administrative subdivisions==

Before its dissolution in 1945, Regierungsbezirk Breslau comprised the following districts:

===Stadtkreise (urban districts)===
*Stadtkreis Breslau
*Stadtkreis Brieg
*Stadtkreis Schweidnitz
*Stadtkreis Waldenburg

<text>Toon is a comedy tabletop role-playing game in which the players take the roles of cartoon characters. It is subtitled &quot;The Cartoon Roleplaying Game&quot;. &quot;Toon&quot; was designed by Greg Costikyan and developed by Warren Spector, and first published in 1984 by Steve Jackson Games.

== Development ==
Jeff Dee came up with the idea of creating a role-playing game based on cartoons when he and Greg Costikyan were talking with several other designers about genres that no one had designed game systems for; although they agreed that such a game would be impossible to design, Costikyan designed &quot;Toon&quot; a few years later as a full game with the assistance of Warren Spector.

== Style ==
Although &quot;Toon&quot; is a genuine role-playing game requiring the participation of players and a game master (called the &quot;Animator&quot;), it is designed with a tongue-in-cheek style that deliberately parodies many of the conventions of more standard, &quot;serious&quot; role-playing games.

In &quot;Toon&quot; the player characters never die. As in many role-playing games, characters have hit points, which are deducted when the character is injured (usually in combat, or by having anvils fall on them). When characters are reduced to zero hit points they do not die or fall unconscious, but fall down. Since cartoon characters never actually die, and always return in time for the next scene, a fallen down character returns to play a set time later, with all hit points restored.

This lack of true &quot;character death&quot; is also designed to encourage players to deliberately abandon the skills and reflexes they learned in other games, namely to have their characters able to solve problems and fight enemies while staying alive. According to the game&#x27;s rules, the two prime directives for &quot;Toon&quot; players to follow are &quot;Forget Everything You Know&quot; and &quot;Act Before You Think&quot;.

The game encourages players to have fun above all other considerations – even to the point of breaking the rules of the game. If the players and the Animator agree that a players&#x27; actions in a game are funny and enjoyable, then that players&#x27; actions are allowed and encouraged. This can be seen as a way for players to &quot;break the fourth wall&quot; in the game, in the same way that animated cartoons often ignore reality for the sake of laughs.

The game uses a very simple skill-based task resolution system based on a list of only 23 skills that cover all possible character actions. These are assigned to four controlling attributes, humorously named &quot;Muscle&quot; (strength), &quot;Zip&quot; (dexterity and speed), &quot;Smarts&quot; (intelligence) and &quot;Chutzpah&quot; (pushiness and self-confidence). In addition, characters can have optional &quot;Shticks&quot;, which give them unusual cartoon-like abilities, such as flying or invisibility.

The game was inspired by the classic Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1930s through the 1960s, and characters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, but Steve Jackson Games is careful to avoid any copyright violations. For example, there is an &quot;Ace Corporation&quot; in &quot;Toon&quot; products (instead of the Acme Corporation), and the writers&#x27; guidelines for &quot;Toon&quot; prohibit the use of the word &quot;&quot; to mean &quot;a cartoon character&quot;.

==Reception==
In the December 1984 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #92), Michael Dobson commented that the game &quot;appears at first glance to be an elaborate joke.&quot; But then he went on to say that &quot;&quot;Toon&quot; is a genuinely good idea – an original (if unlikely) concept in role-playing – that is enjoyable, fast-moving, and incredibly silly.&quot; Dobson liked the simplicity of the rules system, and concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, &quot;Inspired silliness – the very heart of this game.&quot;

In the December 1984 edition of &quot;Imagine&quot; (Issue #21), Mike Lewis liked the game, stating, &quot;Toon is a very refreshing change from the usual run-of-the-mill rpgs which have been appearing recently. The game very firmly puts a sense of humour back into rpgs. If you are interested in cartoons, then Toon is an essential purchase – but even if you aren&#x27;t, try it for a change. I am very impressed with the ideas behind this game and hope that it gets more support than most minority RPGs have done in the past. It deserves it.&quot;

In the January–February 1985 edition of &quot;Space Gamer&quot; (No. 72), R.A. Greer gave a positive review, commenting, &quot;&quot;Toon&quot; is a quick cure for all your roleplaying ills, a fast-acting balm to be applied directly to your funny bone, speeding you back to those uncomplicated days of roleplaying when it was &quot;fun&quot;!&quot;

In the January–February 1985 edition of &quot;Different Worlds&quot; (Issue #38), Larry DiTillio found much to like and gave the game a solid three stars out of four. He called the character generation rules &quot;dirt simple&quot;, and found that resolving skills &quot;is even easier than generating characters.&quot; He also admired the writing style, saying &quot;[Greg] Costikyan has clarity, wit, and the good sense to be brief, as well as an obvious love for cartoons. The rulebook not only reads quickly and easily, it makes you eager to play the game.&quot; DiTillio concluded &quot;for a few hours of silliness, &quot;Toon&quot; can&#x27;t be beat and is a refreshing change from the ofttimes leaden pace of other role-playing games. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s simple.&quot;

In the March 1985 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue #63), Stephen Kyle gave the game an excellent overall rating of 9 out of 10, stating that &quot;all of us have favourite cartoons or characters and &quot;Toon&quot; enables you to recreate them easily and with a lot of fun.&quot;

In the April 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #144), Jim Bambra took a retrospective look at the then five-year old game, and called it &quot;a classic – a game which deserves the attention of everyone looking for a dramatic change of pace and emphasis in their role-playing.&quot; Bambra complimented the easy rules and flexible system, and concluded, &quot;I highly recommend it as an evening’s entertainment and as a cure to role-playing blues. Buy a copy if you are in a silly mood or need to be cheered up.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan commented &quot;If not the funniest RPG ... &quot;Toon&quot; is certainly the oddest ... It&#x27;s a world of utter anarchy.&quot; Swan admired the creative list of skills and the Fifty Percent rule used by referees in ambiguous situations. However, Swan warned &quot;Any game as freeform as &quot;Toon&quot; depends heavily on the improvisational skills of the referee, which is the game&#x27;s major drawback.&quot; Despite this, Swan concluded by giving the game an excellent rating of 3.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;In the hands of a witty referee and a group of receptive players, &quot;Toon&quot; can be hilarious, an excellent introductory game for novices, and a delightful change of pace for veterans.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;While other games had been funny before now, &quot;Toon&quot; was the first game entirely focused on comedy. More importantly, it was the first in a wave of rules-light games that flew in the face of the accepted design doctrine that RPGs needed complex rules systems to be fun or satisfying.&quot;

<text>Wasaga Beach (or simply Wasaga) is a town in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. Situated along the longest freshwater beach in the world, it is a popular summer tourist destination. It is located along the southern end of Georgian Bay, approximately north of Toronto and about northwest of Barrie. To the west, Collingwood and The Blue Mountains also attract visitors much of the year. The town is situated along a very long sandy beach on Nottawasaga Bay in Georgian Bay and the winding Nottawasaga River. The beaches are part of the Wasaga Beach Provincial Park; the park area totals 168 hectares (415 acres). Wasaga Beach has a year-round population of 24,862 as of 2021, but during the summer months the population increases with many seasonal residents.

The economy has struggled for some years, particularly since a major fire in late November 2007 destroyed many of the stores. It depends on tourists in an area where the primary shopping season is three to four months per year. In March 2017, the town passed its Downtown Development Master Plan, a 20-year strategy for significant redevelopment of the tourist area and adding a downtown to the business area. The goal is to improve tourism, diversify the economy, and get beyond its &quot;party town&quot; image.

==History==
Wasaga Beach and the surrounding area was inhabited by the Huron-Wendat Nation for centuries before they were conquered and driven from their ancestral lands in 1649 by the Iroquois Haudenosaunee (Known as the Five Nation Iroquois Confederacy). &quot;Wasaga&quot; is a contraction of the Algonquin word &quot;Nottawasaga&quot;. &quot;Nottawa&quot; means &quot;Iroquois&quot; and &quot;saga&quot; means &quot;mouth of the river&quot;; the word &quot;Nottawasaga&quot; was used by Algonquin scouts as a warning if they saw Iroquois raiding parties approaching their villages.

In 1812 the United States declared war on Great Britain and invaded Upper Canada on several occasions. Wasaga Beach became a strategic location at the mouth of the Nottawasaga River leading to Fort Willow and the Nine Mile Portage which was part of the supply line for British forces in the War of 1812 to Fort Michilimackinac and points to the north and west. The Royal Navy schooner HMS &quot;Nancy&quot; was scuttled in the Nottawasaga River to prevent the Americans from capturing her and her stores.

Lumbering was the main industry for the remainder of the 19th century. Logs were floated downriver and into the bay, gathered at ports to feed local saw mills.

Because Wasaga Beach had sandy soil unsuitable for cultivation, it did not attract early European settlement. In the 1820s the first sign of settlement in the area began as John Goessman surveyed Flos Township. In 1826, land was being sold for four shillings an acre. Though unsuitable for farming, the Wasaga Beach area had an abundance of trees. In the late 1830s and throughout the rest of the century, the logging industry was key to the economy and integral to development of the area. The first permanent settler was John Van Vlack, who arrived in 1869 and founded a settlement on the south side of the Nottawasaga River near its mouth and named it after himself. In 1872, a wooden bridge, the Vanvlack Bridge, was constructed east of the present Main Street bridge to provide access to the beach, then used mainly as a road. The name Wasaga Beach was first used in the area in the late 19th Century.

During the 1900s, families began to discover the beauty of the area. The beach gradually became a place for family picnics and holidays during the summer months, and the first cottages were built. In 1909, a new steel bridge was constructed to replace the Vanvlack Bridge. Wasaga Beach had its beginning as a major resort area when the first beachfront hotel, The Capstan Inn, was opened in 1915 by entrepreneur John McLean in what would later develop into the present Beach One area. In 1918, he opened the Dardanella Dance Hall, and over the next several decades more hotels, venues, and amusements would open. During the 1940s, servicemen stationed at Base Borden, a nearby military base, visited Wasaga Beach&#x27;s amusement park (named &quot;Playland&quot;), and they made Wasaga Beach known across the country. After the war, Wasaga Beach continued to be a popular place for cottagers and day trippers. However, most of the attractions would subsequently close down, with Playland ceasing operations in 1985. Two waterparks, both named Waterworld, opened that year, but were closed in the mid-2000&#x27;s due to multiple cost issues, with the location at Beach One converted into a splash pad. 

Wasaga Beach entered history&#x27;s headlines in 1934. It was the site of departure for the first overseas flight from mainland Canada across the Atlantic to England. A plane, named &quot;Trail of the Caribou&quot;, used the beach as a makeshift runway.

The town was originally referred to as &quot;the northern border of Flos Sunnidale and Nottawasaga Townships&quot;. The first municipal reference occurred with a designation of a Local Improvement District in 1947. In 1949, Wasaga Beach was classified as a police village in the Township of Sunnidale, and was incorporated as a village in 1951.

In 1959, the beach was designated as a &quot;Crown beach&quot;, which was the precursor to the establishment of Wasaga Beach Provincial Park. The province began expropriating beachfront properties to create a continuous belt of parkland along the full length of the beach, save for keeping part of the main beach area for commercial uses. This proved controversial; so the province scaled down plans and settled for separated parks, which are today&#x27;s Beach Areas 2-6. Driving and parking on the beach was previously permitted and popular, but in 1973 the province took cars off the beach. However, a paved beachfront street, Beach Drive, was constructed along Beach 1 shortly thereafter. 

Wasaga Beach was incorporated as a town on January 1, 1974, and its boundaries were expanded. The permanent population stood at 4,034, a dramatic increase from 1965, when 500 people were residents. Today, the town has 24,862 full-time residents and 16,000 seasonal and part-time residents.

===2007 Beach One fire===
On November 30, 2007, a major fire destroyed 90 per cent of the buildings along the street mall in the Beach One area. About 17 seasonal businesses were said to have been affected, including bikini shops, ice cream parlours, a restaurant, a motel, and an arcade. Nearly 100 firefighters from surrounding areas battled the blaze for hours. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; later reported that &quot;Twenty-one businesses in eight buildings overlooking Georgian Bay were destroyed, causing an estimated $5 million in damages.&quot;

Controversy also arose over whether or not the fire was deliberately set in order to allow unobstructed progression with the planned development or whether it was simply an accident. Two young men (one from Barrie and the other from Springwater) were charged with arson, although there was no evidence that the fire was deliberately set to remove the old buildings in advance of planned development.

The Town of Wasaga Beach worked out a plan to help the remaining businesses open for the season but plans for hotels, a theme park and a monorail were cancelled and never revived.

== Local government ==
The town&#x27;s council includes a mayor, deputy mayor, and five councilors that are elected at-large. The members of council elected as of the 2022 municipal election are:

Mayor: Brian Smith

Deputy Mayor: Tanya Snell

Councillors:

* Joe Belanger
* Sasha-Rose Dileo
* Faye Ego
* Ellen Timms 
* Richard White

== Economic challenges ==

Despite the major fire, the beach and the remaining businesses reopened the following summer. Although the destroyed buildings had been considered dated, they were missed by residents and visitors. In 2008, an entertainment dome was built, intended as a temporary structure until development started. It lasted until February 2011 when the exterior cover was destroyed during a storm; repairs were not done and the dome never reopened. The structure was removed in May 2012.

The long-term plans after the fire, by Armand and Dov Levy&#x27;s Blue Beach Avenue corporation, included a rebuild of the area in a modern style with shopping and the aforementioned indoor/outdoor theme park, two major hotels and monorail. The proposed development came to an abrupt end when Blue Beach Avenue declared bankruptcy in 2010. &quot;The past couple of years haven&#x27;t been kind to the tourist industry ... So I gather there were some major cash shortfalls that put them in this situation,&quot; the town&#x27;s mayor said at that time.
Armand Levy was subsequently charged with fraud in 2012 after an investigation of misappropriation of the insurance money paid out after the 2007 fire but was ultimately acquitted.

Reduced tourism, partly because of the loss of many retail buildings, has continued to be a problem in the area. The majority of sales take place during the tourist season, which is typically not much longer than three months per year. (The most recent stats indicate a decline in tourism &quot;of roughly 100,000 a year between 2002 and 2012&quot;.)

To step up development, in 2015 the town spent $13.5 million to purchase seven properties, including eight buildings and 28 rental units, along Beach Area One, becoming a landlord to some businesses, including three bars. The town acquired any existing leases from tenants and succeeded in leasing most of the empty space to commercial enterprises by July 2016. A few of the tenants subsequently enquired about the possibility of breaking their leases because they were struggling financially. The town council agreed to a one-time opportunity for businesses to break their leases without a penalty; requests to do so had to be submitted no later than September 23, 2016.

The beach is owned and operated by Ontario Parks as the Wasaga Beach Provincial Park, and it is the area&#x27;s primary attraction. Of the six main beach areas, Beach areas One and Two and the adjacent private/public lands have historically functioned as the main destination for tourism activity. Due to the economic climate, losses due to fires, and recent failed private redevelopment plans, Beach areas One and Two have been in steady decline.

This area is so important to the town that it undertook an in-depth community visioning exercise, called Opportunity Wasaga, to develop a long-term vision for the future of the public and private lands in this area.

There has been a great deal of controversy (among the public and council members) about the previous strategies used by the Town of Wasaga Beach, including the 2015 purchase of the seven properties for $13.8 million, using borrowed money. &quot;That&#x27;s no small sum for the town of 18,000 that will collect $20.3 million in property taxes this year and spend $48 million in operating and capital costs,&quot; according to a report by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

== New development plans ==
An entirely new Downtown Development Master Plan was released by town council in late January 2017, with an estimate for capital investment of $625 million and a 20 plus year time frame for completion. The first phase (five to 10 years) will cost about $200 million for two development areas, one on the beach and one across the river.

In July 2018, under the council led by then-mayor Brian Smith, council agreed to enter into a Letter of Intent with FRAM Building Group for the development of town-owned land in the downtown and at the beachfront.

In December 2018, under a new council, with Nina Bifolchi as mayor, council decided to undertake a review of the development of town-owned lands in the downtown and at the beachfront.

The council agreed to let the Letter of Intent the town had with FRAM Building Group Ltd. lapse at the end of December 2018 as a first step in the review process. The Downtown Master Plan, however, remained in place. In March 2019, FRAM advised the town it was not interested in being a part of future development of the beachfront. The town began looking for other developers interested in developing town-owned land at the beachfront. 

In September 2021, the Wasaga Beach Ratepayers Association opposed the scope of what they perceived to be excessively high densities in the development plans, and the association&#x27;s president was accused by the Town of spreading false information and exaggerating said densities, as well as claiming residents were being shut out of Town Hall. This led to residents protesting in October.

By June 2024, the years-long plan for the beachfront redevelopment was finally approved, and was unveiled at a public meeting attended by hundreds at the RecPlex on June 20 by Mayor Brian Smith and the project leader from FRAM Building Groupwho had initially pulled out of the project in 2019 before rejoiningand Sunray Group of Hotels. Development of the first phase is expected to begin in Spring 2025 with demolition of many of the old buildings along Beach Drive and the construction of a 150-room hotel. 
===Casino===
 The Playtime Casino Wasaga is located on Mosley Street just east of Highway 26, and opened on November 23, 2022. The casino was first proposed in March 2018 by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation who selected Gateway Casinos to operate a casino in the South Georgian Bay area, and Wasaga Beach was selected as the location in October of that year.

Between April 16 and May 1, 2023, the casino was closed due to Gateway Casinos being the victim of a cyberattack, which resulted in the closure of all its casinos in Ontario.
==Wasaga Beach Provincial Park==

Wasaga Beach Provincial Park is a small recreational provincial park consisting of the eight beaches with of beach. Beach Areas 1–6 can be accessed off Mosley Street in Wasaga. Allenwood and New Wasaga Beaches are north of the Nottawasaga River and are accessed via River Road East.

The park is available for day use only. Its area totals of which are protected. The park is a habitat for birds, primarily for shorebirds including the endangered piping plover. Hiking trails of over are available. In winter, they are used for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The visitor centre provides access to the Nancy Island Historic Site with a theatre, a museum and a lighthouse.

==Geography==
Over two million people visit Wasaga Beach every summer, attracted by the town&#x27;s freshwater beach (stretching ), swim in shallow (warm), clean water and enjoy the panoramic views of the Niagara Escarpment across the bay. There are many recreational trails that are used for hiking, cycling, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling. The Nottawasaga River offers game fishing and canoe routes.

The beach is divided into sections, with the beaches numbered 1 to 6 from east to west, with off-beach public park areas, mostly with parking and all with toilet facilities. A published summary indicates that Beaches 2–4 benefit from shade trees, a bike trail and a playground. Beach 1 is the most touristy, with bars, beach-themed shops and fast food restaurants, attracting primarily young adults. Beach areas 3 to 6 have many seasonal waterfront cottages between the park areas; Shore Lane is used for jogging, biking and roller blading. There are two additional beaches nearby, New Wasaga Beach and Allenwood Beach that are cut off from the 1–6 beach areas by the river; these also have seasonal residents. The town publishes a map of all of these areas.

In the summer months it is a popular place for beach volleyball and sunbathing. A boardwalk runs most of the way along Beach 1 and 2. Beach 1 draws the largest crowds, with the popularity of the beaches decreasing further west. East of the town limits, the sandy beach continues east and north into Tiny Beaches, nearly as far as the tip of the Penetang Peninsula. The beach in these areas is also fronted by many cottages and homes, but unlike in Wasaga Beach, the beaches are mostly private property.

The beach&#x27;s position on the waters of Nottawasaga Bay means that summer temperatures are moderated somewhat by the water, so summer days can be quite comfortable especially when there is a breeze off the bay. In winter, however, winds off the bay trigger very heavy and intense snow squalls. Due to these heavy snowfalls, activities include snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and other winter sports. Downhill skiing is available at nearby Blue Mountain. There are many miles of fresh groomed trails for snowmobiling thanks to the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs and in part to the purchasers of the trail passes.

An unusual aspect of the town compared to other Ontario Cottage country communities, is that most of the cottages are non-waterfront and are closely spaced on a network of side streets within the town itself (mostly between Mosley Street and the bay), rather than being located on larger lots in more rustic settings often well outside the said towns as is the typical case elsewhere. Older residential areas typically have a semi-rural, &quot;woodsy&quot; character, although more recent (post-1990) developments are suburban in nature.

The town has a large community centre; the RecPlex, which has an auditorium, an amphitheatre and a YMCA. There is also the Wasaga Stars Arena, which is being replaced by a larger facility, which is expected to be completed by the summer of 2023.

<doc id="644941" wikidata="Q539470" url="?curid=644941" title="Sam Johnson">
<text>Samuel Robert Johnson (October 11, 1930 – May 27, 2020) was an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for in Congress from 1991 to 2019. He was a member of the Republican Party. In October and November 2015, he was the acting Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, where he also served as chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee.

Johnson was also a United States Air Force colonel and was a decorated fighter pilot in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War where in the latter he was an American prisoner of war in North Vietnam for nearly seven years. On January 6, 2017, Johnson announced he would not run for reelection in 2018. After the death of Louise Slaughter in March 2018, he became the oldest sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He was the last Korean War veteran to serve in Congress.

== Early life and education ==
Johnson was born October 11, 1930, in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Mima (Nabors) and Samuel Robert Johnson, Jr. Johnson grew up in Dallas and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947. Johnson graduated from his hometown Southern Methodist University in 1951, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration. While at SMU, Johnson joined the Delta Chi social fraternity as well as the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity.

He attained a master&#x27;s degree from the Elliott School of International Affairs of the George Washington University in 1976.

== Military career ==
Johnson had a 29-year career in the United States Air Force, where he served as director of the Air Force Fighter Weapons School and flew the F-100 Super Sabre with the Air Force Thunderbirds precision flying demonstration team. He commanded the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Homestead AFB, Florida, and an air division at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, retiring as a colonel. One of his classmates in flight school was future astronaut Buzz Aldrin. The two remained lifelong friends.

He was a combat veteran of both the Korean and Vietnam Wars as a fighter pilot. During the Korean War, he flew 62 combat missions in the F-86 Sabre and shot down one Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15. During the Vietnam War, Johnson flew the F-4 Phantom II.

===POW===
On April 16, 1966, while flying his 25th combat mission in Vietnam, he was shot down over North Vietnam and suffered a broken right arm and broken back. He was a prisoner of war for nearly seven years, including 42 months in solitary confinement. During this period, he was repeatedly tortured.

Johnson was part of a group of eleven U.S. military prisoners known as the Alcatraz Gang, a group of prisoners separated from other captives for their resistance to their captors. They were held in &quot;Alcatraz&quot;, a special facility about one mile away from the Hỏa Lò Prison, notably nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;. Johnson, like the others, was kept in solitary confinement, locked nightly in legcuffs in a windowless 3-by-9-foot concrete cell with the light on around the clock. Johnson was released on February 12, 1973, during Operation Homecoming. He recounted the details of his POW experience in his autobiography, &quot;Captive Warriors&quot;. By the time of his release, he weighed only 120 pounds. His right hand was permanently disabled, and he was left with a noticeable limp for the rest of his life.

In 2018, Johnson donated objects related to his imprisonment to the collection of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

==Post-military career==
After his military career, he established a homebuilding business in Plano, Texas.

=== Texas House of Representatives ===
He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1984 and was re-elected three times, serving a total of seven years in the state legislature.

===U.S. House of Representatives===


On May 8, 1991, he was elected to the U.S. House in a special election brought about by eight-year incumbent Steve Bartlett&#x27;s resignation to become mayor of Dallas. Johnson defeated fellow conservative Republican Thomas Pauken, also of Dallas, 24,004 (52.6 percent) to 21,647 (47.4 percent).

====Selected elections====

===== 2004 =====

Johnson ran unopposed by the Democratic Party in his district in the 2004 election. Paul Jenkins, an independent, and James Vessels, a member of the Libertarian Party, ran against Johnson. Johnson won overwhelmingly in a highly Republican district. Johnson garnered 86% of the vote (178,099), while Jenkins earned 8% (16,850) and Vessels 6% (13,204).

===== 2006 =====
Johnson ran for re-election in 2006, defeating his opponent Robert Edward Johnson in the Republican primary, 85 to 15 percent.

In the general election, Johnson faced Democrat Dan Dodd and Libertarian Christopher J. Claytor. Both Dodd and Claytor are West Point graduates. Dodd was a U.S. Air Force officer who served in Vietnam, while Claytor served in Operation Southern Watch in Kuwait in 1992. It was only the fourth time that Johnson had faced Democratic opposition.

Johnson retained his seat, taking 62.5% of the vote, while Dodd received 34.9% and Claytor received 2.6%. However, this was by far less a margin of victory then in past years, when Johnson won by 80 percent or more.

===== 2008 =====
Johnson retained his seat in the House of Representatives by defeating Democrat Tom Daley and Libertarian nominee Christopher J. Claytor in the 2008 general election. He won with 60 percent of the vote, an unusually low total for such a heavily Republican district.

===== 2010 =====
Johnson won re-election with 66.3 percent of the vote against Democrat John Lingenfelder (31.3 percent) and Libertarian Christopher Claytor (2.4 percent).

===== 2014 =====
Johnson handily won re-nomination to his twelfth full term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4. He polled 30,943 votes (80.5 percent); two challengers, Josh Loveless and Harry Pierce, held the remaining combined 19.5 percent of the votes cast.

===== 2016 =====
Johnson won reelection to his 13th full term in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 193,684 votes (61.2 percent), he defeated Democrat Adam P. Bell, who polled 109,420 (34.6 percent). Scott Jameson and Paul Blair, the nominees of the Libertarian and Green parties, polled 10,448 votes (3.3 percent) and 2,915 (0.92 percent), respectively.

===== 2018 =====
Three days after being sworn in for his 14th term overall and his 13th full term, Johnson announced he would not run for reelection.

==== Tenure ====

In the House, Johnson was an ardent conservative. By some views, Johnson had the most conservative record in the House for three consecutive years, opposing pork barrel projects of all kinds, voting for more IRAs and against extending unemployment benefits. The conservative watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste consistently rated him as being friendly to taxpayers. Johnson was a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

Johnson was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, and joined Dan Burton, Ernest Istook, and John Doolittle in refounding it in 1994 after Newt Gingrich pulled its funding. He alternated as chairman with the other three co-founders in the late 1990s.

In November 1997, Johnson was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Johnson voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Johnson voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes needed to be adopted).

On the Ways and Means Committee, he was an early advocate and, then, sponsor of the successful repeal in 2000 of the earnings limit for Social Security recipients. He proposed the Good Samaritan Tax Act to allow corporations to take a tax deduction for charitable giving of food. He chaired the Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations, where he encouraged small business owners to expand their pension and benefits for employees. In December 2016, Johnson introduced H.R. 6489, a bill that would increase Social Security payments to low-income beneficiaries while reducing payments to high-income beneficiaries and would gradually add two years to the minimum age for receiving full retirement payments.

Johnson opposed calls for government intervention in the name of energy reform if such reform would hamper the market and or place undue burdens on individuals seeking to earn decent wages. He called for allowing additional drilling for oil in Alaska.

After the death of John McCain, Johnson became the only Vietnam-era prisoner of war serving in Congress.

In December 2017, Johnson signed a letter from Congress (along with 106 other Congress members) to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai supporting his plan to repeal net neutrality ahead of the commission&#x27;s vote.

** Subcommittee on Social Security (Chairman)
* Joint Committee on Taxation

===Caucus memberships===

* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus

==Personal life==
Johnson was married to Shirley L. Melton of Dallas from 1950 until her death on December 3, 2015. They had three children and ten grandchildren. Their son Bob predeceased both his parents in 2013.

Johnson died on May 27, 2020, in Plano, Texas, the city where he lived the last years of his life. The cause of death was not disclosed but a former spokesperson had announced it was unrelated to COVID-19. He was 89. He was buried with full military honors at Restland Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas on June 8.

Johnson was a Methodist. He sat on the board of directors of the Institute in Basic Life Principles.

===Silver Star citations===

Silver Star for Actions of 16 April 1966

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 8, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Samuel Robert Johnson, United States Air Force, for gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force while serving with the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, Ubon Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand, Pacific Air Force, in action in Southeast Asia on 16 April 1966. On that date, Major Johnson led a flight of two F-4C Fighter-Bombers on a twilight armed recce mission against a heavily defended target deep within hostile territory. Locating the target despite restricted visibility due to haze and terrain, Major Johnson encountered a curtain of flak as he rolled in for his first strike. Immediately altering his attack, although at a dangerously low altitude, he turned into the very teeth of fire from the menacing guns and continued to press the attack until his aircraft sustained mortal damage, forcing him to eject. This courageous act, attempted in the face of devastating ground fire at minimum altitude and great personal risk, epitomized the finest qualities of a true combat pilot. By his gallantry and devotion to duty, Major Johnson has reflected great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.
Silver Star for Actions of January 1969

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 8, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Colonel Samuel Robert Johnson, United States Air Force, for gallantry and intrepidity in action in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force during January 1969, while a Prisoner of War in North Vietnam. Ignoring international agreements on treatment of prisoners of war, the enemy resorted to mental and physical cruelties to obtain information, confessions, and propaganda materials. Colonel Johnson resisted their demands by calling upon his deepest inner strengths in a manner which reflected his devotion to duty and great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

<text>Serra () is a municipality in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Bordering the north of the state&#x27;s capital, Vitória, the municipality is part of the Greater Vitória metropolitan area. Its population was 520,653 (2022) and its area is 548 km.

Serra, the seat of the municipality, is to the north of the characteristic Mestre Álvaro mountain which juts out of the coastal lowlands, and which is said to look like a small mountain range or &quot;serra&quot;, in Portuguese, which is where the town and municipality got its name.

==Politics==
Serra has five districts (&quot;distritos&quot;): Serra-Capital (or Serra-Sede), Carapina, Calogi, Nova Almeida and Queimado. Among those districts there are 118 neighbourhoods (&quot;bairros&quot;).

Another important urban area is that of Jacaraípe, on the coast 20 km north of Vitória. Jacaraípe is very well known for surfing championships, and is a weekend beach used by capital dwellers. Other smaller fishing villages such as Manguinhos are also close enough for day trips and are popular destinations for the locals.

The coastline of the municipality is protected in part by the Costa das Algas Environmental Protection Area, created in 2010.

<text>Bogantungan is a rural town in the locality of Willows in the Central Highlands Region, Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==
The town is north west of the state capital Brisbane and west of the regional city of Rockhampton.

The Central Western railway line passes through the town which was once served by the Bogantungan railway station. The small number of houses in the town are located around the railway station. The Capricorn Highway once passed through the town but now bypasses it to the north.

==History==
The name &quot;Bogantungan&quot; derives from Aboriginal words &quot;&quot;bogan&quot; meaning &quot;grass&quot; and &quot;tungan&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot;&quot;.

The Central Western railway was built in sections, beginning at Rockhampton and then heading west. Each section involved establishing a temporary settlement to accommodate the workers while they were building the railway. After that section was complete, the workers moved further west were a new settlement was established. Although intended as temporary, some of these settlements continued to survive after the railway workers had moved on, becoming permanent towns. Bogantungan was one of these. In its heyday, it was a town of some thousands of people, with around 30 hotels.

In March 1881, the Queensland Government held a land sale, auctioning 48 town lots in the town of Bogantungan.

Bogantungan Post Office opened on 8 July 1881 and closed in 1982.

Bogantungan State School opened on 19 March 1883. It closed on 11 August 1972. It was on Jackson Street ().

Nearby Medway station, in the Bogantungan ranges, was established by Robert Donaldson and C.E. Glissan. The Donaldson family, including Agnes Adelaide Donaldson moved there in 1909, and after the business partnership was dissolved the Donaldsons have continued to manage the property into the present day, as a cattle stud.

On 26 February 1960, Bogantungan was the site of the Medway Creek rail disaster, one of Queensland&#x27;s worst train accidents. &quot;The Midlander&quot; passenger train, heading east to Rockhampton, passed over the flooded Medway Creek, just west of the town. The bridge collapsed when the train was partly over, with a number of carriages dropping into the water. A total of 4 passengers and 3 crew were killed, with 43 injured.

== Attractions ==

Boguntungan Railway Station is now a small historical museum and rest area, with a memorial and interpretive panels about the rail disaster and the railway buildings.

== Education ==
There are no schools in Bogantungan. The nearest primary schools are in Lochington ( south by minor roads), Anakie ( east on the Capricorn Highway) or Alpha ( west on the Capricorn Highway). The nearest secondary school is in Alpha (to Year 10 only). The nearest secondary school offering education to Year 12 is Emerald State High School in Emerald ( east on the Capricorn Highway). Other secondary alternatives are distance education and boarding schools.
