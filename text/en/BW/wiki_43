<text>The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) is a pharmacopeia (compendium of drug information) for the United States published annually by the over 200-year old United States Pharmacopeial Convention (usually also called the USP), a nonprofit organization that owns the trademark and also owns the copyright on the pharmacopeia itself. 

The &quot;USP&quot; is published in a combined volume with the &quot;National Formulary&quot; (a formulary) as the USP-NF. If a drug ingredient or drug product has an applicable &quot;USP&quot; quality standard (in the form of a &quot;USP-NF&quot; monograph), it must conform in order to use the designation &quot;USP&quot; or &quot;NF&quot;. Drugs subject to &quot;USP&quot; standards include both human drugs (prescription, over-the-counter, or otherwise) and animal drugs. &quot;USP-NF&quot; standards also have a role in US federal law; a drug or drug ingredient with a name recognized in &quot;USP-NF&quot; is considered adulterated if it does not satisfy compendial standards for strength, quality, or purity. USP also sets standards for dietary supplements and food ingredients (as part of the &quot;Food Chemicals Codex&quot;). USP has no role in enforcing its standards; enforcement is the responsibility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other government authorities in the United States.

==History of the United States Pharmacopeia Organization==

The U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) was formed in 1820 when 11 physicians came together to take action to protect patients from being harmed by the inconsistent and poor-quality medical preparations at that time. The first standards were &quot;recipes&quot; that guided the preparation of medicines, which were often manufactured in apothecaries relying heavily on crude botanical drugs having therapeutic activities. When the modern pharmaceutical industry emerged, USP standards changed from those &quot;recipes&quot; to a set of quality specifications for medicines along with analytical tests to be performed to assess their purity, quality, and authenticity.

== Product quality–standards and verification ==

&quot;USP&quot; establishes documentary (written) and reference (physical) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products, and ingredients. These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency. USP 800 is an example of a publication created by the United States Pharmacopeia.

Prescription and over-the-counter medicines available in the United States must, by federal law, meet &quot;USP-NF&quot; public standards, where such standards exist. Many other countries use the &quot;USP-NF&quot; instead of issuing their own pharmacopeia, or to supplement their government pharmacopeia.

USP&#x27;s standards for food ingredients can be found in its &quot;Food Chemicals Codex&quot; (&quot;FCC&quot;). The &quot;FCC&quot; is a compendium of standards used internationally for the quality and purity of food ingredients like preservatives, flavorings, colorings, and nutrients. While the &quot;FCC&quot; is recognized in law in countries like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, it currently does not have statutory recognition in the United States, although &quot;FCC&quot; standards are incorporated by reference in over 200 FDA food regulations. USP obtained the &quot;FCC&quot; from the Institute of Medicine in 2006. The IOM had published the first five editions of the &quot;FCC&quot;.

USP also conducts verification programs for dietary supplement products and ingredients. These are testing and audit programs. Products that meet the requirements of the program can display the USP Verified Dietary Supplement Mark on their labels. This is different from seeing the letters &quot;USP&quot; alone on a dietary supplement label, which means that the manufacturer is claiming to adhere to USP standards. &quot;USP&quot; does not test such products as it does with USP Verified products.

== Healthcare information ==

In the past, Congress authorized the Secretary of HHS to request USP to develop a drug classification system that Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit plans may use to develop their formularies, and to revise such classification from time to time to reflect changes in therapeutic uses covered by Part D drugs and the addition of new covered Part D drugs. USP has developed six versions of the Model Guidelines, the last issued early in 2014 for the 2015–2017 benefit years.

== Promoting the Quality of Medicines program ==

Since 1992, USP has worked cooperatively with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help developing countries address critical issues related to poor quality medicines. This partnership operated as the Drug Quality and Information (DQI) program until 2009, when, to better meet growing global needs, USAID awarded USP a five-year, $35 million cooperative agreement to establish a new, expanded program called Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM). In 2013 USAID extended the PQM program for five years (through September 2019), increased its funding to $110 million, and expanded the geographical reach of the program.

PQM serves as a primary mechanism to help USAID-supported countries strengthen their quality assurance and quality control systems to better ensure the quality of medicines that reach patients. PQM has four key objectives:
* Strengthen quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems
* Increase the supply of quality assured medicines
* Combat the availability of substandard and counterfeit medicines
* Provide technical leadership and global advocacy

USP-USAID collaborative efforts have helped communities improve drug quality in more than 35 countries. PQM currently works in Africa, Asia, Europe/Eurasia, and the Caribbean/Latin America.

== International agreements and offices ==

USP works internationally, largely through agreements with other pharmacopeias, as well as regulatory bodies, manufacturer associations, and others. In recent years, USP signed a series of Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with groups including the Pharmacopeia of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, nine countries belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Federal Service on Surveillance in Healthcare and Social Development of the Russian Federation (Roszdravnadzor). USP also operates an international office in Switzerland and offices and laboratories in Brazil, India, and China.

<text>Alexei Vyacheslavovich Kovalev (; born February 24, 1973) is a Russian professional ice hockey coach, executive and former professional player. He is currently serving as the assistant coach for HC Kunlun Red Star of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

During his career, he played in over 1,300 National Hockey League (NHL) games over 18 seasons for the New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, and Florida Panthers between 1992 and 2013. He was originally drafted by the Rangers and won a Stanley Cup with them in 1994.

Kovalev also played in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) with Atlant Moscow Oblast, and was last active with EHC Visp of Switzerland&#x27;s National League B.

==Playing career==
Kovalev was drafted by the New York Rangers in the first round, 15th overall, of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. He became the first Russian-born player to be drafted in the first round in the history of the NHL as well as the first Soviet player to be drafted in the first round. Best known for his stickhandling skills, deking ability and wrist shot, he became an important part of the Rangers&#x27; 1994 Stanley Cup run, finishing with the third-most points for New York in the 1994 playoffs. Kovalev, Alexander Karpovtsev, Sergei Nemchinov and Sergei Zubov were the first Russians to have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup. The Rangers&#x27; Stanley Cup win is well remembered in Europe because of the first Russian names on the Stanley Cup, as MSG Network broadcaster Al Trautwig said in his essay, &quot;Garden of Dreams&quot;.

During the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Kovalev returned to Russia to play for his hometown team Lada Togliatti, the defending International Hockey League champion from 1994. Kovalev scored eight goals and eight assists in 12 games. He also participated in Lada Togliatti&#x27;s 30th anniversary game, and scored a hat-trick for the Lada veterans team.

Just 14 games into the 1998–99 season, on November 25, 1998, Kovalev was traded, along with Harry York, to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Petr Nedvěd, Sean Pronger and Chris Tamer. While only putting up 46 points in 63 games with the Penguins, he managed a strong effort with 12 points in 10 post-season games. In the next two seasons, he recorded two of his best seasons in the NHL with 76 and 95 points, respectively.

In a trade to mainly reduce their salary, Pittsburgh sent Kovalev back to the Rangers on February 10, 2003. He was sent, along with Dan LaCouture, Janne Laukkanen and Mike Wilson, for Mikael Samuelsson, Rico Fata, Joel Bouchard, Richard Lintner and cash.

On March 13, 2004, Kovalev was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for Jozef Balej and a second-round draft pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. While only managing three points in 12 games in the regular season, Kovalev broke out in the 2004 playoffs, registering six goals and ten points in 11 games.

Kovalev spent the 2004–05 NHL lockout playing for Ak Bars Kazan, in the Russian Superleague (RSL), where he registered 23 points in 35 games. He then played for Russia at the 2005 World Championships in Austria, and was named the tournament&#x27;s best forward.

As an unrestricted free agent, Kovalev opted to re-sign with Montreal on a four-year contract paying $4.5 million annually just prior to the start of the 2005–06 season, on August 3. He scored his 300th career goal and recorded his 700th point on December 20, 2005, against Dominik Hašek in a 4–3 win against the Ottawa Senators.

In 2006, Warrior signed Kovalev to endorse their hockey sticks. Warrior designed a custom shaft known as the AK27.

In 2007, Kovalev sparked controversy when he allegedly criticized his team, coaching staff and the Montreal media in an interview with a Russian reporter in his native language. During that 2006–07 season, he amassed only 18 goals and 29 assists for a total of 47 points.

During the 2007–08 season, Kovalev found a resurgence playing alongside linemates Andrei Kostitsyn and Tomáš Plekanec, recording a total of 35 goals, 49 assists for a total of 84 points in 82 games. As of the season&#x27;s completion, he stood at the 94th spot of the top 100 all-time NHL scorers. Due to his inspired play, Kovalev was awarded the Canadiens&#x27; captaincy on two occasions during the season, replacing the injured Saku Koivu in his absence.

The following season, in 2008–09, Kovalev was named captain of the Eastern Conference at the 2009 NHL All-Star game in Montreal, and won Most Valuable Player honors as a result of his two goals, assist and game-winning shootout goal. Late in the season with the Canadiens, Kovalev scored his 100th goal with the club on March 31, 2009, against former teammate and Canadiens goaltender Cristobal Huet of the Chicago Blackhawks. At the end of the week, he was named the NHL&#x27;s First Star for the Week ending April 5 after scoring two goals and seven assists, helping lead the Canadiens to three wins during that time.
On July 6, 2009, Kovalev signed a two-year, $10 million contract with the Ottawa Senators as an unrestricted free agent. On December 25, 2009, Kovalev was excluded from the main roster for the Russian team for the 2010 Winter Olympics, to the surprise of fellow countryman Evgeni Malkin (though he was selected as a reserve by Team Russia in case an injury occurred during the tournament). On January 3, 2010, Kovalev scored a career-high four goals in a 7–4 win against the Philadelphia Flyers.
On November 22, 2010, Kovalev netted his sixth goal of the season, scoring his 1,000th point in his career, notching the goal at exactly 10:00 of the first period against the Los Angeles Kings.
On February 24, 2011, his 38th birthday, Kovalev waived his no-trade clause to be traded back to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a conditional seventh-round draft pick. The pick would have been upgraded to the sixth round if the Penguins had reached the second round of the playoffs, which they did not. At the time of the trade, the Penguins were without 12 of their regular players, including Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.

Kovalev&#x27;s return to Pittsburgh was brief, as General Manager Ray Shero announced on May 28, 2011, that he had no intention of re-signing the underachieving forward.

After failing to sign with an NHL team for the 2011–12 season, Kovalev returned to Russia to play with the Atlant Moscow Oblast in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). In June 2012, he was released from the two-year deal he signed with Atlant Moscow Oblast, at which point he declared his desire to return to the NHL. &quot;Hopefully, I&#x27;ll find an NHL team,&quot; Kovalev told the Montreal Gazette.

After the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Kovalev was given a tryout by the Florida Panthers, eventually signing a one-year contract with the team. &quot;You could see how talented they are and they want to be in this League. All I want to do is help them. …I know I can match anyone in this locker room. I can still play this game,&quot; Kovalev said about the Panthers. In his first game as a Panther, Kovalev scored a goal and recorded two assists, one of the latter of which was an assist on teammate Jonathan Huberdeau&#x27;s first career NHL goal.

On March 21, 2013, Kovalev officially announced his retirement from professional hockey. At that point, he had not played for the Panthers since a loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on February 22.

However, Kovalev&#x27;s retirement lasted less than three months. Swiss National League B (NLB) team EHC Visp announced on June 10, 2013, that they had signed him to a one-year contract with an option for a second year. He appeared in 44 regular season games, notching 22 goals and 30 assists for 52 points and winning Swiss NLB championship.

On July 3, 2014, Kovalev again announced his retirement from professional hockey at the age of 41.

On January 30, 2016, Kovalev revealed that he was yet again considering a return to professional ice hockey in the NHL. He referenced Jaromír Jágr, who is of similar age to him, as his reason to believe a comeback was possible. A team specifically mentioned was the Canadiens, however no team reached out to him.

Kovalev made a return to professional ice hockey on October 18, 2016, playing again for EHC Visp, the team he has become general manager of, after forward William Rapuzzi became injured before the day of the game. Kovalev gathered an assist on a goal by Jon Rheault, and finished the game with 14 penalty minutes, after receiving a game misconduct and being ejected from the game in the third period, for a hit from behind. Kovalev had been taking part in team practices since the beginning of the season.

<doc id="644272" wikidata="Q3446354" url="?curid=644272" title="John Pinkerton">
<text>John Pinkerton (17 February 1758 – 10 March 1826) was a Scottish antiquarian, cartographer, author, numismatist, historian, and early advocate of Germanic racial supremacy theory.

He was born in Edinburgh, as one of three sons to James Pinkerton and Mary (nee Heron or Bowie) Pinkerton. He lived in the neighbourhood of that city for some of his earliest childhood years, but later moved to Lanark. His studious youth brought him extensive knowledge of the Classics, and it is known that in his childhood years he enjoyed translating Roman authors such as Livy. He moved on to Edinburgh University, and after graduating, remained in the city to take up an apprenticeship in Law. However, his scholarly inclinations led him to abandon the legal profession after he began writing &quot;Elegy on Craigmillar Castle&quot;, first published in 1776.

==London and publications==
In 1781, Pinkerton moved to London, where his full career as a writer began in earnest, publishing in the same year a volume of &quot;Rimes&quot; of no great merit, and &quot;Scottish Tragic Ballads&quot;. These were followed in 1782 by &quot;Two Dithyrambic Odes on Enthusiasm and Laughter&quot;, and by a series of &quot;Tales in Verse&quot;. Under the title of &quot;Select Scottish Ballads&quot; he reprinted in 1783 his tragic ballads, with a supplement comprising &quot;Ballads of the Comic Kind&quot;. Joseph Ritson pointed out in 1784 that the so-called ancient ballads were some of them of modern date, and Pinkerton admitted that he was the author of the second part of &quot;Hardy Kanute&quot; and part-author of some others. He published an &quot;Essay on Medals&quot; in 1784, and in 1785, under the pseudonym of &quot;Robert Heron&quot;, his bold but eccentric &quot;Letters of Literature&quot; depreciating the classical authors of Greece and Rome. In 1786 he edited &quot;Ancient Scottish Poems&quot; from the manuscript collections of Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington. It was succeeded in 1787 by a compilation, under the new pseudonym of &quot;H. Bennet&quot; entitled The &quot;Treasury of Wit&quot;, and by his first important historical work, the &quot;Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths&quot;, to which Gibbon acknowledged himself indebted.

His edition of Barbour&#x27;s &quot;Bruce&quot; and a &quot;Medallic History of England to the Revolution&quot; appeared in 1790; a collection of Scottish poems reprinted from scarce editions in 1792; and a series of biographical sketches, the &quot;Iconographia scotica&quot;, in the years 1795 to 1797. In 1797 he published a &quot;History of Scotland from the Accession of the House of Stuart to that of Mary&quot; (which includes an edition of &quot;The Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis&quot;). A new biographical collection, the &quot;Gallery of Eminent Persons of Scotland&quot; (1799), was succeeded after a short interval by a &quot;Modern Geography digested on a New Plan&quot; (1802; enlarged 1807).

==Celtic/Gothic furore==
Pinkerton next collected and printed in 1789 certain &quot;Vitae sanctorum scotiae&quot;, and, a little later, published his &quot;Enquiry into the History of Scotland preceding the Reign of Malcolm III&quot;. His assertion that the Celts were incapable of assimilating the highest forms of civilisation excited &quot;violent disgust&quot;, but the Enquiry was twice reprinted, in 1794 and 1814, and is still of value for the documents embodied in it.

Pinkerton very much wished to purge his country&#x27;s history of all Celtic elements. In this aim, through two works, the &quot;Dissertation on the Origins and Progress of the Scythians or Goths&quot; (1787) and the &quot;Enquiry into the History of Scotland preceding the reign of Malcolm III&quot; (1789), he developed the theory that the Picts were in fact of the race of ancient Goths, that the Scots language was a pure descendant of the Picto-Gothic language; and, moreover, that the Gaels, or Highlanders, were a degenerate impostor race.

In essence, the Pinkerton theory stated that:

&quot;[T]he Gothic and Celtic races were originally and generically different: that this difference has ever been clear and distinct, in their physiognomic, physiological, and moral character&quot; and that it is &quot;as distinct, and as distinguishable&quot; to this day.

The two characteristics were as follows:

&quot;The Gothic tribes, it is said, were and still are red, or yellow-haired, blue-eyed, fair complexioned, large of limb, and tall of stature.&quot;

&quot;The Celtic, on the other hand, dark-haired, dark-eyed, of swarthy complexion, and small in stature.&quot;

As well as believing that Goths were different to Celts, Pinkerton also believed that Goths were superior, stating &quot;[w]hat a lion is to an ass, such is a Goth to a Celt.&quot;

His theory essentially stated that the people of England were of a superior stock to those of Scotland, Ireland and Wales. He described the Celtic inhabitants of Britain as &quot;a black-haired race,&quot; and stated that those with &quot;fair faces, and red or light hair&quot; possessed the &quot;grand features of the Goths&quot; and were of &quot;Gothic extract.&quot;

In an effort to advance his theories, Pinkerton turned to comparing Celtic and Germanic philology. He wanted to show that Scotland&#x27;s Celtic placenames were not Celtic at all—many of these attempts being discredited by modern scholars. Pinkerton thought, for instance, that &quot;Aber&quot; (as in Aberdeen) came from the German &quot;über&quot; rather than from the Celtic for confluence of a river, and likewise, that the Gaelic word &quot;Inver&quot; (equivalent of Aber) was a borrowing from Danish.

To this end he set his energy to collecting and creating older Anglo-Scottish literature. This was all the more important as far as his agenda was concerned because of the &quot;Celtomania&quot; produced by the Ossian poems of James Macpherson. Many such works had been invented by Pinkerton. His &quot;ancient&quot; Anglo-Scottish tale of &quot;Hardyknute&quot; had in fact only been composed in 1719 by Lady Wardlaw of Pitreavie. Pinkerton subsequently invented a sequel to this epic, but after he was exposed by Joseph Ritson, he admitted to the forgery.

Pinkerton&#x27;s correspondence with fellow academics is characterised by verbal abuse. Hugh Trevor-Roper, one modern historian inclined to sympathise with at least the spirit of his views, called him &quot;eccentric.&quot; Other historians have hinted at mild insanity. Despite this, Pinkerton is still an important figure in the history of British antiquarianism.

==Cartography==

Pinkerton was a celebrated master of the Edinburgh school of cartography which lasted from roughly 1800 to 1830. Pinkerton, along with John Thomson &amp; Co. and John Cary, redefined cartography by exchanging the elaborate cartouches and fantastical beasts used in the 18th century for more accurate detail. Pinkerton&#x27;s main work was the &quot;Pinkerton&#x27;s Modern Atlas&quot; published from 1808 through 1815 with an American version by Dobson &amp; Co. in 1818. Pinkerton maps are today greatly valued for their quality, size, colouration, and detail.

==Later life==
Some of Pinkerton&#x27;s collection of books and maps was sold at auction in London, by Leigh &amp; Sotheby, on 7 January 1813 (and 6 following days); a copy of the catalogue is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.159(1)). About 1818 he left London for Paris, where he made his headquarters until his death on 10 March 1826. He spent his later years impoverished. His remaining publications were the &quot;Recollections of Paris in the years 1802–5&quot; (1806); a very useful &quot;General Collection of Voyages and Travels&quot; (1808–1814); a &quot;New Modern Atlas&quot; (1808–1819); and his &quot;Petralogy&quot; (1811).

<doc id="644275" wikidata="Q3435386" url="?curid=644275" title="Robert Heron (writer)">
<text>Robert Heron (6 November 1764 – 13 April 1807) was a Scottish writer.

==Life==
Robert Heron was son of John Heron, a weaver, and was born in New Galloway, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 6 November 1764. He was taught privately by his mother until his ninth year, when he was sent to the parish school, where he displayed such precocity that at the age of eleven he was employed to teach some of the local farmers&#x27; children and at fourteen was appointed master of the parochial school of Kelton. 

By the end of 1780, he had saved sufficient money to enable him, with the help of his parents, to enter the University of Edinburgh with the view of studying for the church. He supported his studies partly by teaching but chiefly by miscellaneous work for booksellers. In autumn 1789, while a divinity student, he visited Robert Burns, who entrusted him with a letter to a Dr. Blacklock, which he failed to deliver. In a rhyming epistle to Blacklock, Burns attributes Heron&#x27;s faithlessness either to preoccupation with &#x27;some dainty fair one,’ or to partiality for liquor.
Heron was for some time assistant to a Dr. Blair, but, according to his own statement, all his &#x27;ideas, as well of exertion as of enjoyment, soon became literary.&#x27; His first independent literary venture was a small edition in 1789 of Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Seasons&quot;, with a criticism on his poetry; a larger edition appeared in 1793. In 1790–1, he announced a course of lectures on the &quot;Law of Nature, the Law of Nations, the Jewish, the Grecian, the Roman and the Canon Law, and then on the Feudal Law,&quot; intended as an introduction to the study of law, but the scheme was unsuccessful. 

His imprudent habits overwhelmed him with debt, and he was thrown into prison by his creditors. On their suggestion, he undertook a &quot;History of Scotland&quot; for Messrs. Morrison of Perth, who engaged to pay him three guineas per sheet. After making some progress he was liberated from prison on condition of devoting two-thirds of his remuneration to paying 15&quot;s&quot;. in the pound. The first volume (1794), was nearly all written in gaol. In his preface, he expressed a hope that this would be regarded as some excuse for &#x27;considerable imperfections.&#x27; The excuse is naive but all Heron&#x27;s works bear evident marks of superficial knowledge and hurried composition. The &quot;History&quot; was completed in six volumes, 1794–9. 

In 1798, at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, Heron produced a comedy which was condemned before the second act. Attributing its failure to a conspiracy against him, he published it under the title &quot;St. Kilda in Edinburgh, or News from Camperdown, a Comic Drama in Two Acts, with a Critical Preface, to which is added an Account of a famous Ass Race&quot; (1798); the publication attracted no attention. Returning to New Galloway as a ruling elder, Heron served several years in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and frequently spoke with fluency and ability. 

In order to obtain more constant literary occupation, he removed in 1799 to London, where he contributed largely to the periodicals, editing the &quot;Globe,&quot; the &quot;British Press,&quot; and other newspapers, and acting as a parliamentary reporter. In 1806 he commenced a newspaper entitled &quot;The Fame,&quot; which proved unsuccessful. Its failure and Heron&#x27;s improvident habits led to his confinement by his creditors in Newgate prison, where, according to his own statement, he was reduced &#x27;to the very extremity of bodily and pecuniary distress.&#x27; On 2 February 1807, from Newgate, he wrote a letter to the Royal Literary Fund, recounting his services to literature, and appealing for aid. He received £20 but this was insufficient to cover his debts. Being attacked by fever, Heron was removed to St Pancras Hospital, where he died 13 April 1807. 

==Works==
Besides the works above mentioned, Heron also published: 
# A translation of Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;Travels through Arabia,&quot; 1792. 
# &quot;Elegant Extracts of Natural History,&quot; 1792. 
# &quot;Arabian Tales, or continuations of Arabian Nights&#x27; Entertainments,&quot; translated from the French, 4 vols. 1792. 
# &quot;Observations made in a Journey through the Western Counties of Scotland in 1792,&quot; 2 vols., Perth, 1792; 2nd ed. 1799. 
# &quot;General View of the Natural Circumstances of the Hebrides,&quot; 1794. 
# &quot;Letters which passed between General Dumourier and Pache, Minister of War to the French Republic in 1792,&quot; translated from the French, 1794. 
# &quot;Information concerning the Strength, Views, and Interests of the Powers presently at War,&quot; 1794. 
# A translation of Fourcroy&#x27;s &quot;Chemistry,&quot; 1796. 
# &quot;An Account of the Life of Muley Liezet, late Emperor of Morocco,&quot; translated from the French, 1797. 
# &quot;Letter to Sir John Sinclair, bart., on the necessity of an instant Change of Ministry&quot;, published under the name of Ralph Anderson, 1797. 
# &quot;Scotland Described,&quot; Edinburgh, 1797, 12mo. 
# &quot;Life of Robert Burns,&quot; Edinburgh, 1797 (a work of some value, owing to the writer&#x27;s knowledge of the south-west of Scotland). 
# &quot;A New and Complete System of Universal Geography, to which is added a Philosophical View of Universal History,&quot; 4 vols. 1798. 
# &quot;Elements of Chemistry,&quot; London, 1800. 
# &quot;Letter to William Wilberforce, esq., M.P., on the Justice and Expediency of the Slave Trade, and on the best means to improve the Manners and Condition of the Negroes in the West Indies,&quot; 1806. An edition of the &quot;Letters of Junius&quot;, 1802, in Watt&#x27;s &quot;Bibl. Brit.&quot; is credited to Pinkerton, but a letter in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;, 1st ser. vi. 445, clearly shows that Heron and not Pinkerton was the editor. Pinkerton was, however, the author of &quot;Letters of Literature&quot;, published under the pseudonym of &#x27;Robert Heron&#x27; in 1784. 

A manuscript &quot;Journal of My Conduct&quot;, by Heron, is in the library of the University of Edinburgh (Laing collection). Heron also contributed to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica,&quot; the &quot;Edinburgh Magazine,&quot; and other periodicals; and was employed by Sir John Sinclair in the preparation of the &quot;Statistical Account of Scotland.&quot;

<text>Andrew Joseph Ernest Raycroft nicknamed Razor (born May 4, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender and current media personality. Originally drafted by the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL) 135th overall in 1998, he won the Calder Memorial Trophy with the club in 2004 as rookie of the year. Raycroft has also played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Colorado Avalanche, Vancouver Canucks, Dallas Stars, Hockey Milano Rossoblu and IF Björklöven.

Since 2014, he has been a volunteer assistant coach for the University of Connecticut&#x27;s men&#x27;s hockey team. Raycroft is currently a rinkside and studio analyst for the Boston Bruins broadcasts on NESN and a host on the hockey podcast &quot;Morning Bru with Jaffe &amp; Razor&quot;.

==Playing career==

===Early years/Boston Bruins===
Prior to entering the junior hockey ranks, Raycroft grew up playing minor hockey with the Quinte Red Devils AAA system in the Eastern Ontario AAA League of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA). In 1997–98, he began a three-year career in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), playing for the Kingston Frontenacs and Sudbury Wolves. He also played junior for the Wellington Dukes of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League (OPJAHL).

Raycroft was drafted 135th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut in 2000–01 with the Bruins, replacing Byron Dafoe in a 5–1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. However, as a late-game replacement, he was not given the decision. Raycroft recorded his first NHL win two days later on October 9 in a 4–2 win over the Florida Panthers. Raycroft played 11 games total for the Bruins in his first season, while playing the majority of his first three professional seasons with the team&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL).

After the Bruins renewed his contract on July 31, 2003, Raycroft played his first full NHL season in 2003–04, compiling a 29–18–9 record with a 2.05 goals against average (GAA), .926 save percentage and three shutouts. He helped lead the Bruins to a second-place finish in the regular season in the Eastern Conference &quot;en route&quot; to the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs. Not having played enough games to qualify as a rookie in his previous three NHL seasons, Raycroft was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy in 2004 as league rookie of the year.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Raycroft signed with Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Elitserien on November 6, 2004. However, he did not play any games for the team and signed with Tappara Tampere of the Finnish SM-liiga several months later on January 17, 2005. When NHL play resumed, he struggled with the Bruins in the 2005–06 season, managing only eight wins while being a healthy scratch for the majority of the season. He was demoted to the Bruins&#x27; third-string position to starter Tim Thomas and rookie backup Hannu Toivonen.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
The following off-season, on June 24, 2006, Raycroft was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for the rights to Finnish goaltending prospect Tuukka Rask. It was later revealed the Bruins intended to release him, which would have made him available to Toronto without any compensation at all. He began playing for the Maple Leafs in the 2006–07 season and earned his first shutout and win as a Leaf in a 6-0 victory against the Ottawa Senators on October 5, 2006. On April 3, 2007, Raycroft tied the Leafs&#x27; franchise record for most wins by a goaltender in the regular season (37), previously held by Ed Belfour in 2002–03 (Raycroft played more games than Belfour and earned three shootout wins, which did not exist prior to the 2005–06 season). Despite this record, he finished 49th in GAA and 56th in save percentage as the Leafs failed to qualify for the playoffs.

Raycroft struggled at the start of the 2007–08 season and surrendered the starting position to Vesa Toskala. The Leafs then placed him on waivers on June 24, 2008,
and bought out the remainder of his contract on June 27.

===Colorado Avalanche===
Several days after being bought out by the Maple Leafs, on July 1, he signed a one-year deal with the Colorado Avalanche. Despite being brought in to back-up Peter Budaj, Raycroft started the 2008–09 season strong, becoming only the second Avalanche goaltender to begin a season with a 9–1 record. In 31 games with the Avalanche, Raycroft posted a 12-16-0 record with a 3.14 GAA.

===Vancouver Canucks===
On July 6, 2009, Raycroft signed a one-year contract with the Vancouver Canucks. He earned the backup position behind Roberto Luongo after competing with prospect Cory Schneider during training camp. He recorded his first win with the Canucks in his first start on October 29 in a 2–1 shootout win against the Los Angeles Kings after Luongo was sidelined with a fractured rib. Raycroft faced his former Avalanche teammates several days later on November 1 and recorded his first shutout as a Canuck in a 3–0 win. Raycroft won his 100th NHL career game on February 12, 2010, in a 4–3 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets.
===Dallas Stars===
On July 1, 2010, Raycroft signed a two-year contract as a free agent with the Dallas Stars. He compiled an 8–5 record with a 2.83 GAA in his first season in Dallas, backing-up Stars starter Kari Lehtonen.

On December 29, 2011, Raycroft was assigned to the Texas Stars, the Dallas Stars&#x27; AHL affiliate. Richard Bachman replaced Raycroft as backup to the Stars starter Lehtonen. He played in the minors for the remainder of his contract.

===Europe===
On July 3, 2012, with little NHL interest and an impending lockout on the horizon, Raycroft left his North American career to begin a new venture in Europe by signing to a one-year deal with Italian Serie A club, Milano Rossoblu. The Italian team has been in proposed talks to join the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

On July 15, 2013, it was announced Raycroft would join IF Björklöven for the 2013–14 season.

On April 9, 2014, Raycroft announced his retirement from professional hockey. He later joined the Connecticut Huskies men&#x27;s ice hockey as a volunteer assistant coach.

===Broadcasting===

Following his playing career, Raycroft became active in media, including stints with ESPN and the New England Sports Network where he covers college hockey and the Boston Bruins respectively. Since 2021, Raycroft has hosted a Bruins podcast with fellow NESN employee Billy Jaffe entitled &quot;Morning Bru with Jaffe &amp; Razor.&quot;

<text>Abong-Mbang is a town and commune in the Haut-Nyong department, East Region of Cameroon. Abong-Mbang is located at a crossroads of National Route 10 and the road that leads south to Lomié. Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, is 178 km to the west, and Bertoua, the capital of the East Province, lies 108 km to the east. From Ayos, at the border in the Centre Province 145 km (90 mi) from Abong-Mbang, the tar on National Route 10 ends and a dirt road begins. 

Abong-Mbang is the seat of the Haut-Nyong department. The town is headed by a mayor. Gustave Mouamossé has held the post since August 2002. Abong-Mbang is site of one of the East Province&#x27;s four Courts of First Instance and a prefectural prison. The population was estimated at 18,700 in 2001.

==History==
According to oral traditions of the Kwassio and Bakola peoples, Abong-Mbang was settled when the Maka-Njem peoples moved northwest from the Great Lakes region of the Congo River. They encountered Pygmy hunter-gatherers and requested their aid as guides through the region. Some of the migrants settled in the vicinity, which they called &quot;Bung-Ngwang&quot; (&quot;bathing area in the Nyong River&quot;). When Europeans arrived in the 19th century, this name was changed to &quot;Abong-Mbang&quot;. Some migrants continued westward in search of salt; they became the Kwassio and Bakola of Cameroon&#x27;s coast. German colonisers moved into the area in the late 19th century. They used the Nyong River as a means to reach the wild rubber growing farther inland. The Germans built a fort and other military and administrative buildings in the town. The fort is today a prefectural prison, and the other buildings serve similar administrative functions. The French took over in 1919 following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I.
==People and economy==
Abong-Mbang is the main settlement of the Maka people, a group who speak a Bantu language of the same name. Much of the population farms; important crops include bananas, cocoa, corn, groundnuts, tomatoes, and tubers. Shifting cultivation with no fertiliser is the primary method of agriculture. Baka hunter-gatherers live in the surrounding forests. Since colonial times, the government has attempted to better integrate this group into Cameroonian society. Abong-Mbang is part of the Doumé-Abong-Mbang diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The church estimates that 46.7% of the population is Roman Catholic.

Since Francophone Cameroun&#x27;s independence in 1960, Abong-Mbang has become an important centre of commerce for the East Province. This has led to a cosmopolitan influx of immigrants from outside the Maka area. An estimated 99% of males and 95% of females speak French. However, among traders, Ewondo is the lingua franca of choice: 72% use Ewondo but only 48% use French in market situations. By the late 1970s, the government had zoned large areas of the surrounding forest for timber exploitation. Most timber and bushmeat traffic from the East Province passes through the town. Union Abong-Mbang FC is the local football (soccer) team. The town often suffers prolonged cuts to electric power, which the utility company, AES-SONEL, blames on an aging power plant. On 17 September 2007, violent protests against the cuts ended with two protesters dead and 10 others seriously injured.
==Geography==
Abong-Mbang lies on the South Cameroon Plateau, approximately 700 metres above sea level. The soils are red. The Boumba, Dja, and Nyong rivers rise in the Abong-Mbang region. The Nyong forms the town&#x27;s northern border and is navigable for about 160 km (100 mi) to Mbalmayo in the Centre Province. The area along the Nyong consists of swampy forests that support populations of raffia palm, such as &quot;Raphia montbuttorum&quot;. The area surrounding the town consists of secondary-growth forest of semi-deciduous trees, particularly &quot;Sterculiaceae&quot; and &quot;Ulmaceae&quot;; the primary-growth forest has been removed for logging and farming. In some areas, the forests are further degraded and home to other forms of vegetation. The Abong-Mbang Forest Reserve is north of the town. Local wildlife includes populations of western lowland gorilla and forest elephants. An estimated 100 elephants lived in the Abong-Mbang Forest Reserve in 1998. The Ntimbe Caves are 18 km (11 mi) south of the town.

<text>Erich Josef Gliebe (born May 23, 1963) is an American former boxer, Neo-Nazi and former chairman of the National Alliance. In his youth, he was a professional boxer by the ring name of &quot;The Aryan Barbarian&quot;.

== Biography ==
Erich Gliebe&#x27;s political views were influenced by his father, who served in the German Wehrmacht during World War II. He became active within the National Alliance, a white nationalist, antisemitic and white supremacist political organization in the United States. As leader of the Cleveland National Alliance Local Unit, he was hired by William Pierce to run the White-power music label Resistance Records after the National Alliance bought full ownership of it in 1999.

Following Pierce&#x27;s death in July 2002, Gliebe was appointed the new Chairman by the Board of Directors. He quickly began to alienate members, causing a backlash within the NA leadership.

<text>Emmanuel Legace (born February 4, 1973) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender, who played most notably in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, and later the St. Louis Blues between 1998 and 2010. Legace also enjoyed spells with the Los Angeles Kings, Carolina Hurricanes, and Iserlohn Roosters of the DEL. He finished his playing career for the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League, for whom he is the career leader in goaltending wins. Legace is the former goaltending coach for the NHL&#x27;s Columbus Blue Jackets.

Legace was born in Toronto, Ontario, but grew up in Alliston, Ontario.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Legace played in the 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Don Mills.

Prior to being selected by the Whalers, Legace played in the Ontario Hockey League with the Niagara Falls Thunder and in Roller Hockey International for the Toronto Planets. Legace spent the 1993–1994 season as a member of the Canadian National Team and played in sixteen games.

From there, Legace spent a lengthy apprenticeship in the minor leagues, largely for the Springfield Falcons, between 1994–98. He was a star with Springfield, garnering First Team All-Star honors and the AHL&#x27;s leading goaltender award in 1996.

He also played a brief stint for the ECHL&#x27;s Richmond Renegades in 1996–97 and for the IHL&#x27;s Las Vegas Thunder in 1997–98. On July 31, 1998, the Carolina Hurricanes traded Legace to the Los Angeles Kings for a conditional draft pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft.

Although he spent most of the 1999 season with the IHL Long Beach Ice Dogs, Legace got his first NHL start with the Kings. While he played well in limited action for Los Angeles, he signed with Detroit on July 15, 1999. However, since the Red Wings had both Chris Osgood and Ken Wregget as veteran goaltenders, Legace was left unprotected on waivers. He was then claimed by the Vancouver Canucks on September 29, 1999. Yet almost two weeks later, on October 13, 1999, Legace was reacquired by the Red Wings from the waiver wire when the Canucks in turn left him unprotected. While Legace spent most of his time playing for the IHL&#x27;s Manitoba Moose, he did get some action while playing for the Red Wings, posting a perfect 4–0–0 record.

===Detroit Red Wings===
In training camp the next season, Legace beat out Wregget to establish himself as the backup goaltender to Chris Osgood. Osgood had a very slow start, and Legace subsequently saw much action. Posting a 24–5–5 record in 39 games, Legace looked to have assumed the starting role for the team. However, Osgood regained his stride and resumed starting duties in the playoffs.

With the 2001–02 season, Legace became backup to Dominik Hašek when Osgood was waived and claimed by the New York Islanders. Legace played in 20 games and only saw playoff action to relieve Hašek during Game 3 of the semifinals of the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs to the St. Louis Blues; the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup that season.

The next season, with the retirement of Hašek and the signing of star goaltender Curtis Joseph, Legace saw his workload increase from 20 games to 25 games in the 2002–03 season, yet remained the team&#x27;s backup.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, Hašek made the startling decision to come out of retirement and return to the Red Wings. Curtis Joseph was still being paid $8 million a year and, due to his hefty contract, was not likely to be traded or picked up by a team. While Legace was initially going to be the 3rd goalie behind two elite goaltenders, the Red Wings opted to send Joseph to the minors while Legace served as Hašek&#x27;s backup. Hašek, however, was not properly conditioned for a return to the NHL. Minor injuries and inconsistent play from Hašek thrust Legace into the starting role. Injuries to both Hašek and Legace opened the door for the Red Wings to call up Joseph from the minors, along with Joey MacDonald to serve as his backup. When Legace returned from injury, MacDonald was sent back to the minors while Legace and Joseph ended up serving as Detroit&#x27;s goaltending tandem for the remainder of the season, as Hašek opted not to return to the team from injury. An injury to Joseph late in the season found Legace temporarily working with minor-league goaltender Marc Lamothe, but Lamothe was returned to the AHL&#x27;s Grand Rapids Griffins when Joseph returned to the roster.

Due to Legace&#x27;s strong play during the regular season, he was announced as Detroit&#x27;s starting goaltender for the start of the 2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Red Wings faced the Nashville Predators in the opening round of the 2004 playoffs. While Legace won the first two games, he did not perform up to team expectations and was pulled in the middle of the fourth game in favor of Joseph, who ended up backstopping for the remainder of the series. The Red Wings won the series but lost the next series against the Calgary Flames.

Legace briefly played in Russia during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, but eventually sat the rest of the season out, preferring to be close to his family in the States. Legace was the NHLPA Representative for the Detroit Red Wings until 2005, when the role was assumed by Nicklas Lidström. Legace has since become a vocal critic of both the league and the players&#x27; union, especially in regard to how both sides handled the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

For the 2005–06 season, Chris Osgood was re-signed by the Red Wings to compete with Legace for the starting job. However, due to Osgood&#x27;s injuries and general lack of conditioning, Legace was awarded the starting goaltender role for the Detroit Red Wings. By October 2005 with the Red Wings defeating the Chicago Blackhawks 5–2, Legace set the record for the most wins by a goaltender in the month of October (10–1).

He would finish the regular season with a record of 37–8–3, helping lead the Red Wings to the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best regular season team by far.

===St. Louis Blues===
Prior to Detroit&#x27;s elimination from the 2006 playoffs, Legace indicated to the media that if Detroit failed to win the opening round of the playoffs, he would not be returning to the team. The Red Wings fell to the Edmonton Oilers in six games. On June 10, 2006, Red Wings general manager Ken Holland announced that Legace would not be offered a contract, thus making him a free agent. Legace signed a one-year contract with Wings&#x27; division-rivals, the St. Louis Blues on August 8, 2006. In his first season with the Blues Legace played in 45 games, posting a 23–15–5 record. His season was cut short due to a mid-season concussion and season-ending knee surgery, but his play was solid enough to earn him a two-year contract extension with the Blues on February 24, 2007.

Legace enjoyed success with St. Louis in the 2007–08 season, and was named to the 2008 NHL All-Star Game. Despite Legace&#x27;s numbers, the Blues failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third consecutive season. In the 2008–09 season, Legace shared starting duties with Chris Mason to begin the season. After failing to repeat his previous season efforts the Blues placed Legace on waivers on February 6, 2009. Legace was then demoted to the team&#x27;s AHL affiliate Peoria Rivermen for the remainder of the season and helped the Rivermen reach the playoffs. Manny admitted later that there was animosity between him and the Blues management.

=== Carolina Hurricanes ===
On November 9, 2009, Legace signed a one-year contract with the Carolina Hurricanes. The two-way deal paid Legace $500,000 to play in the NHL level and $105,000 to play at the AHL level. His first game with the Carolina Hurricanes was on November 11, 2009, against the Los Angeles Kings, where they fell 5–2 in Raleigh at the RBC Center.

===Later years ===
On September 26, 2010, the New York Islanders announced they signed Legace to a PTO. he was released a few weeks later. For the remainder of the 2010–11 season, Legace played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) in Germany for the Iserlohn Roosters, with whom he had a one-year contract.

During the 2011 pre-season, Legace made two exhibition appearances for the Vancouver Canucks on a Professional Tryout basis before being released by the team on September 23. A week later, on September 30, 2011, Legace signed a Professional Tryout contract (PTO) with the San Antonio Rampage of the AHL, the minor league affiliate of the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League. Legace started for the Rampage for the first game of the season vs. the Chicago Wolves, but after approximately 10 minutes he was plowed into by Chicago forward Mike Duco, resulting in an undisclosed leg injury. He would not return to the ice for San Antonio again. On October 20, 2011, he signed a Professional Tryout contract (PTO) with the Springfield Falcons, the minor league affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets and the team he played for in the mid-1990s. Legace finished his career as the backup goaltender in Springfield, after which he briefly served as an intern in the Columbus front office.

== Retirement ==

=== Broadcasting ===
On October 25, 2013, it was announced that Legace had also joined Fox Sports Detroit as a college hockey analyst. 

=== Goaltending coaching ===
On November 14, 2012, Legace accepted the position of goaltender coach for the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the United States Hockey League. After two seasons he joined the Springfield Falcons coaching staff on a full-time basis, serving originally as a goaltending coach before moving into a team consultancy role.

In 2018, Legace became goaltending coach for the Columbus Blue Jackets, a promotion from the same role held with the Blue Jackets&#x27; minor league affiliates, the Cleveland Monsters. Legace was relieved of his duties on April 15, 2023, along with head coach Brad Larsen, after the team failed to qualify for the post season and finished with a 25-48-9 record.

==Personal life==
Legace resides in Novi, Michigan. He has one daughter, Sabrina, and a son, Manny.

On July 4, 2021, Columbus Blue Jackets goaltender Matiss Kivlenieks died from chest trauma caused by a mortar firework explosion at Legace’s home in Novi.

Legace was the starting goaltender for Canada at the 1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he won a gold medal and was named to the All-Star team.

<text>Sir William Boyd Dawkins (26 December 183715 January 1929) was a British geologist and archaeologist. He was a member of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Curator of the Manchester Museum and Professor of Geology at Owens College, Manchester. He is noted for his research on fossils and the antiquity of man. He was involved in many projects including a tunnel under the Humber, a Channel Tunnel attempt and the proving of coal under Kent.

==Background==
Dawkins was born in Wales at Buttington Vicarage in Montgomeryshire on 26 December 1837. He attracted attention at age five by collecting fossils from the local colliery spoil heaps. Soon after, his family moved into England to Fleetwood in Lancashire, where he attended Rossall School. He again attracted attention by adding fossils from the local boulder clay to his earlier collection. After leaving school, he attended Jesus College, Oxford. He graduated with a second in Classics and a first in Natural Sciences.

On leaving Oxford University in 1862, he joined the Geological Survey of Great Britain where he spent seven years working on the areas of Kent and the Thames Valley. In 1869, he was elected a member of the Geological Society and appointed Curator of the Manchester Museum, a position he held until 1890. In 1870, he took a further appointment as a lecturer at Owens College, Manchester. eventually becoming the first Professor of Geology in 1874.

Dawkins became involved with the Manchester Geological and Mining Society and was its President on three occasions: 1874–75, 1876–77 and 1886–87. He was also President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society from 1885 to 1887 and again from 1900 to 1902. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1867 and acted as President of the Anthropological Section of the British Association in 1882 and the Geological Section in 1888. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1880. He was President of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1911–12 and, covering the First World War years, from 1913 to 1919. Dawkins was knighted for &quot;services to geology&quot; in the 1919 Birthday Honours. He died in 1929, aged 91.

==Archaeology==

Dawkins achieved many distinctions in the field of archaeology. In 1859 he moved to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing of the discovery of bones by local workmen he led excavations in the area of the hyena den at Wookey Hole Caves. He also excavated Aveline&#x27;s Hole, expanding its entrance and naming it after his mentor William Talbot Aveline. His work led to the discovery of the first evidence for use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills.

He spent a great deal of time researching in Derbyshire, especially at Creswell Crags and Windy Knoll near Castleton. At Windy Knoll (NGR SK126830), he proved the existence of exotic animals that lived in England prior to the ice ages. With Rooke Pennington and J. Tym, he discovered bones from bison, cave hyena, cave bear and a large cat, possibly a relative of the sabre tooth tiger. The bison bones were more recently dated at 37 300bp (OxA – 4579). Many of the finds are located in the museums of Buxton, Derbyshire and Manchester.

==Kent==
In 1882, following from his work with the Geological Survey, Dawkins was appointed as the official surveyor by the Channel Tunnel Committee. He made a geological survey of the English and French coasts along the Dover and Calais areas, however the project was abandoned due to lack of money. He also participated in a scheme for a tunnel under the Humber.

In 1886, the South Eastern Railway Company approached Dawkins asking him if his Channel Tunnel work had shown any coal under Kent. The finding of coal under Kent would have given the company great financial benefits. Together with Henry Willett and the French geologist Pigou, Dawkins presented a paper in 1887 proving the existence of coal under the Cretaceous deposits of Kent.

==Philanthropy==
Dawkins was a fighter for workers&#x27; rights especially in the coal mining industry. He lobbied hard to get a better education system for miners similar to the ones established in Germany. He donated undisclosed amounts of money to this cause.

Among his other donations was one to the Manchester Museum. The museum wanted to build an extension and started an appeal. The appeal raised £1015 2s 9d, of which Dawkins donated £500. Later in life he fought for compensation for people whose homes had been affected by subsidence from the salt mines and workings near Northwich, Cheshire.

On his death in 1929, his widow Lady Boyd Dawkins presented his library of some 400 works to the town of Buxton, Derbyshire. These books, together with other personal items such as a bronze bust, photographs and his Lyell and Prestwich medals, are housed at Buxton Museum and Art Gallery in the Boyd Dawkins Reference Room.

==Publications==
Dawkins published many books and papers, but the best-known are:

<text>Sir Thomas Englefield (also known as Inglefield) (c. 1455 – 3 April 1514) was Speaker of the House of Commons of England in two sessions, 1497 for Henry VII and 1510 for Henry VIII.

He was born, probably in Englefield in Berkshire, around 1455, the son of John Englefield whose family had been Lords of the Manor there for many generations. His father died while he was quite young and his grandfather, Robert Englefield, had him educated in law at the Middle Temple.

He was created a Knight of the Bath on the marriage of Prince Arthur in 1501. He held land on the Welsh border, notably in Worcestershire where he became a magistrate (JP) in 1493. He was returned to Parliament as knight of the shire (MP) for Berkshire in 1497 and 1510 and on both occasions elected Speaker of the House.

He had married Margery, daughter of Sir Richard Danvers with whom he had two sons, Richard, who died young and Thomas, his heir and the father of the Catholic politician, Sir Francis Englefield.

<doc id="644305" wikidata="Q461733" url="?curid=644305" title="William Robertson Smith">
<text>William Robertson Smith (8 November 184631 March 1894) was a Scottish orientalist, Old Testament scholar, professor of divinity, and minister of the Free Church of Scotland. He was an editor of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and contributor to the &quot;Encyclopaedia Biblica&quot;. He is also known for his book &quot;Religion of the Semites&quot;, which is considered a foundational text in the comparative study of religion.

==Life and career==

Smith was born in Keig in Aberdeenshire the eldest son of Rev Dr William Pirie Smith DD (1811–1890), minister of the recently created Free Church of Scotland for the parishes of Keig and Tough, and of his wife, Jane Robertson. His brother was Charles Michie Smith.

He demonstrated a quick intellect at an early age. He entered Aberdeen University at fifteen, before transferring to New College, Edinburgh, to train for the ministry, in 1866. After graduation he took up a chair in Hebrew at the Aberdeen Free Church College in 1870, succeeding Prof Marcus Sachs.

In 1875, he wrote a number of important articles on religious topics in the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. He became popularly known because of his trial for heresy in the 1870s, following the publication of an article in &quot;Britannica&quot;.
In 1871 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer was Peter Guthrie Tait.

Smith&#x27;s articles approached religious topics without endorsing the Bible as literally true. The result was a furore in the Free Church of Scotland, of which he was a member as well as criticism from conservative parts of America. As a result of the heresy trial, he lost his position at the Aberdeen Free Church College in 1881 and took up a position as a reader in Arabic at the University of Cambridge, where he eventually rose to the position of University Librarian, Professor of Arabic and a fellow of Christ&#x27;s College. It was during this time that he wrote &quot;The Old Testament in the Jewish Church&quot; (1881) and &quot;The Prophets of Israel&quot; (1882), which were intended to be theological treatises for the lay audience.

In 1887 Smith became the editor of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; after the death of his employer Thomas Spencer Baynes left the position vacant. In 1889 he wrote his most important work, &quot;Religion of the Semites&quot;, an account of ancient Jewish religious life which pioneered the use of sociology in the analysis of religious phenomena. He was Professor of Arabic there with the full title &#x27;Sir Thomas Adams Professor of Arabic&#x27; (1889–1894).

He died of tuberculosis at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge on 31 March 1894. He is buried with his parents at Keig churchyard.

==Approach==
His views on the historical method of criticism can be illustrated in the following quote:
Ancient books coming down to us from a period many centuries before the invention of printing have necessarily undergone many vicissitudes. Some of them are preserved only in imperfect copies made by an ignorant scribe of the dark ages. Others have been disfigured by editors, who mixed up foreign matter with the original text. Very often an important book fell altogether out of sight for a long time, and when it came to light again all knowledge of its origin was gone; for old books did not generally have title-pages and prefaces. And, when such a nameless roll was again brought into notice, some half-informed reader or transcriber was not unlikely to give it a new title of his own devising, which was handed down thereafter as if it had been original. Or again, the true meaning and purpose of a book often became obscure in the lapse of centuries, and led to false interpretations. Once more, antiquity has handed down to us many writings which are sheer forgeries, like some of the Apocryphal books, or the Sibylline oracles, or those famous Epistles of Phalaris which formed the subject of Bentley&#x27;s great critical essay. In all such cases the historical critic must destroy the received view, in order to establish the truth. He must review doubtful titles, purge out interpolations, expose forgeries; but he does so only to manifest the truth, and exhibit the genuine remains of antiquity in their real character. A book that is really old and really valuable has nothing to fear from the critic, whose labours can only put its worth in a clearer light, and establish its authority on a surer basis.

==Published works==
Among his writings are the following.

===Books: annotated===
====&quot;The Old Testament in the Jewish Church&quot;====

*&quot;The Old Testament in the Jewish Church. A course of lectures on biblical criticism&quot; (Edinburgh: A. &amp; C. Black 1881); second edition (London: A. &amp; C. Black 1892).
**The author addresses the Christian believer who opposes higher criticism of the Old Testament, considering that it will reduce the Bible to rational historical terms and omit the supernatural [cf. 3–5]. He replies that the Bible&#x27;s purpose is to give its readers entry into the experience of lived faith, to put them in touch with God working in history, which a true understanding of the text will better provide [8–9]. Critical Bible study, in fact, follows in the spirit of the Protestant Reformation [18–19].
**Prior Catholic study of the Bible is faulted for being primarily interested in drawing out consistent &quot;doctrines&quot; [7, 25]. Instead Protestants initially turned to Jewish scholars who could better teach them Hebrew. However, the chief purpose of Jewish learning was legal: the Bible being a source of &quot;Jewish law&quot;, derived to settle their current disputes and issues of practice [52].
**As Protestant bible study continued, the nature of the text began to reveal itself as complex and many layered. For example, especially in the earlier books, two different, redundant, and sometimes inconsistent versions appeared to co-exist [133]. This would imply that an editor had woven several pre-existing narratives together to form a composite text [cf. 90–91].
**The Psalms are shown to reflect the life of the entire Hebrew people, rather than that of a single traditional author, King David [224].
**Prior understanding was that all ritual and civil law in the Pentateuch (Books of Moses) had originated at Mount Sinai; Bible history being the story of how the Hebrews would follow or not a comprehensive moral order [231–232]. Yet from the Bible text, the author demonstrates how ritual law was initially ignored after Moses [254–256, 259]; only much later, following the return from exile, was the ritual system established under Ezra [226–227].
**The Pentateuch contains laws and history [321]. Its history &quot;does not profess to be written by Moses&quot; as &quot;he himself is habitually spoken of in the third person&quot; [323–324]. From internal evidence found in the Bible, Pentateuch history was &quot;written in the land of Canaan&quot; after the death of Moses (c. 13th century BC), probably as late as &quot;the period of kings&quot;, perhaps written under Saul or under David (c. 1010–970) [325].
**The laws found in the Book of Deuteronomy [xii-xxvi] are also demonstrated to date to a time long after Moses [318–320]. In fact, everything in the reforms under King Josiah (r.640-609) are found written in the Deuteronomic code. His &quot;Book of the Covenant&quot; probably is none other than &quot;the law of Deuteronomy, which, in its very form, appears to have once been a separate volume&quot; [258]. Internal evidence found in the bible is discussed [e.g., 353–355].
**In the centuries immediately following Moses, the Pentateuch was not the primary rule; rather Divine spiritual guidance was provided to the ancient Hebrew nation by their prophets [334–345].
*Smith&#x27;s lectures were originally given in Edinburgh and Glasgow during early 1881. &quot;It is of the first importance for the reader to realize that Biblical Criticism is not the invention of modern scholars, but the legitimate interpretation of historical facts.&quot; The result is that &quot;the history of Israel... [makes]... one of the strongest evidences of Christianity.&quot; (Author&#x27;s Preface, 1881).
*Doctrinal opposition against Smith first arose after his 1875 encyclopaedia article &quot;Bible&quot; which covered similar ground. In 1878 Church heresy charges had been filed, &quot;the chief of which concerned the authorship of Deuteronomy.&quot; These 1881 lectures followed his removal as professor at the Free Church College in Aberdeen.
*Smith&#x27;s 1881 edition &quot;was a landmark in the history of biblical criticism in Britain, in particular because it laid before the general public the critical view to which Wellhausen had given classical expression in his &quot;Geschichte Israels&quot; which had appeared less than three years earlier, in 1878.&quot; Yet &quot;Smith did not merely repeat the arguments of Wellhausen, or anyone else; he approached the subject in a quite original way.&quot;

====&quot;The Prophets of Israel&quot;====
*&quot;The Prophets of Israel and their place in history, to the close of the 8th century B.C.&quot; (Edinburgh: A. &amp; C. Black 1882), reprinted with introduction and notes by T. K. Cheney (London: A. &amp; C. Black 1895).
**The Hebrew prophets are presented in context with the ancient religious practice by neighboring nations. Instead of divination, elsewhere often used for political convenience or emotional release (however earnest), here the prophets of Israel witness to the God of justice, i.e., to their God&#x27;s true nature [85–87, 107–108]. In announcing ethical guidance, these ancient prophets declared to the Jewish people the will of their God acting in history [70–75].
**The opening chapters introduce the nature of Jehovah in Jewish history after Moses [33–41, {110–112, 116–118}] discussing neighboring religions [26–27, 38–40, 49–51, 66–68], regional theocracy [47–53], henotheism [53–60], national survival [32–39] and righteousness [34–36, 70–74], as well as Judges [30–31, 39, 42–45], and the prophet Elijah [76–87]. Then follows chapters on the prophets Amos [III], Hosea [IV], and Isaiah [V-VII], wherein Smith seeks to demonstrate how the Hebrew religion grew through each prophet&#x27;s message. The work concludes with the secular and religious history of the period preceding the exile [VIII].
*In his Preface [xlix-lviii, at lvi–lvii], the author acknowledges reliance on critical biblical studies, specifically that established by Ewald, developed by Graf, and furthered by Kuenen referencing his &quot;Godsdienst&quot;, by Duhm per his &quot;Theologie der Propheten&quot;, and by Wellhausen, citing his &quot;Geschichte&quot; (1878).
*The author confidently rests the case for biblical religion on &quot;ordinary methods of historical investigation&quot; [17] and on the &quot;general law of human history that truth is consistent, progressive, and imperishable, while every falsehood is self-contradictory, and ultimately falls to pieces. A religion which has endured every possible trial... declares itself by irresistible evidence to be a thing of reality and power.&quot; [16].
*Yet, despite his heresy trial, current modern scholarship appraises W. R. Smith as too beholden to nineteenth-century Protestant doctrine, so that he fails in his &quot;Prophets of Israel&quot; book to achieve his avowed aim of historical inquiry. However flawed, &quot;he will be remembered as a pioneer.&quot;

====&quot;Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia&quot;====
*&quot;Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia&quot; (Cambridge University 1885); second edition, with additional notes by the Author and by Professor Ignaz Goldziher, Budapest, and edited with an introduction by Stanley A. Cook (London: A. &amp; C. Black 1903); reprint 1963 Beacon Press, Boston, with a new Preface by E. L. Peters. This book in particular, among many others, drew the broad-brush criticism of Prof. Said as swimming in the narrow blinkered sea of 19th-century European Orientalism.
**This work traces, from an earlier totemist matriarchy that practiced exogamy, the further development of a &quot;system of male kinship, with corresponding laws of marriage and tribal organization, which prevailed in Arabia at the time of Mohammed.&quot; (Author&#x27;s Preface).
**Chapters:
***1. The Theory of the Genealogists as to the Origin of Arabic Tribal Groups. &quot;E.g., Bakr and Taghlib (proper names of ancestors), fictitious ancestors, unity of the tribal blood, female eponyms&quot;;
***2. The Kindred Group [&quot;hayy&quot;] and its Dependents and Allies. &quot;E.g., adoption, blood covenant, property, tribe and family&quot;;
***3. The Homogeneity of the Kindred Group in relation to the Law of Marriage and Descent. &quot;E.g., exogamy, types of marriage (e.g., capture, contract, purchase), inheritance, divorce, women&#x27;s property&quot;;
***4. Paternity. &quot;E.g., original sense of fatherhood, polyandry, infanticide&quot;;
***5. Paternity, Polyandry with Male Kinship, and with Kinship through Women. &quot;E.g., evidence of Strabo, conjugal fidelity, chastity, milk brotherhood, two (female, and male) systems of kinship, decay of tribal feeling&quot;;
***6. Female Kinship and Marriage Bars. &quot;E.g. forbidden degrees, the tent (bed) in marriage, matronymic families, &quot;beena&quot; marriages, &quot;ba&#x27;al&quot; marriage, totemism and heterogeneous groups&quot;;
***7. Totemism. &quot;E.g., tribes named from animals, jinn, tribal marks or wasm&quot;;
***8. Conclusion. &quot;E.g., origin of the tribal system, migrations of the Semites&quot;.
*Conceived at the frontier of academic study on early culture, Smith&#x27;s work relied on a current anthropology proposed by the late John Ferguson McLennan, in his &quot;Primitive Marriage&quot; (Edinburgh 1865). (Author&#x27;s Preface). Smith also employed recent material by A. G. Wilken, &quot;Het Matriarchaat bij de oude Arabieren&quot; (1884) and by E. B. Tylor, &quot;Arabian Matriarchate&quot; (1884), and received suggestions from Theodor Nöldeke and from Ignaz Goldziher. (Author&#x27;s Preface).
*Although still admired on several counts, the scholarly consensus now disfavors many of its conclusions. Smith here &quot;forced the facts to fit McLennan&#x27;s evolutionary schema, which was entirely defective.&quot; Professor Edward Evans-Pritchard, while praising Smith for his discussion of the tribe [&quot;hayy&quot;], finds his theories about an early matriarchy wanting. Smith conceived feminine names for tribes as &quot;survivals&quot; of matriarchy, but they may merely reflect grammar, i.e., &quot;collective terms in Arabic are constantly feminine&quot;, or lineage practice, i.e., &quot;in a polygamous society the children of one father may be distinguished into groups by use of their mothers&#x27; names&quot;. Evans-Pritchard also concludes that &quot;Smith makes out no case for the ancient Bedouin being totemic&quot; but only for their &quot;interest in nature&quot;. He faults Smith for his &quot;blind acceptance of McLennan&#x27;s formulations&quot;.
*Smith was part of a general movement by historians, anthropologists, and others, that both theorized a matriarchy present in early civilizations and discovered traces of it. In the 19th century it included eminent scholars and well-known authors such as J.J. Bachofen, James George Frazer, Frederick Engels, and in the 20th century Robert Graves, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Marija Gimbutas. Smith&#x27;s conclusions were based on the then prevailing notion that matrifocal and matrilineal societies were the norm in Europe and western Asia, at least prior to the invasion of the Indo-Europeans from central Asia. Subsequent findings have not been kind to that thread of Smith&#x27;s work which offers a prehistoric matriarchy to schematize the Semites. It is certainly recognized that a large number of prehistoric hunter-gatherer cultures practiced matrilinear or cognatic succession, as do many hunter-gatherer cultures today. Yet it is no longer widely accepted by scholars that the earliest Semites had a matrilineal system. This is due largely to the unearthing of thousands of Safaitic inscriptions in pre-Islamic Arabia, which appear to indicate that, on the issues of inheritance, succession, and political power, the Arabs of the pre-Islamic period were little different from the Arabs today. Evidence from both Arab and Amorite sources discloses the early Semitic family as being mainly patriarchal and patrilineal, as are the Bedouin today, while the early Indo-European family may have been matrilineal, or at least allotting high social status to women. Robert G. Hoyland a scholar of the Arabs and Islam writes, &quot;While descent through the male line would seem to have been the norm in pre-Islamic Arabia, we are occasionally given hints of matrilineal arrangements.&quot;

====&quot;The Religion of the Semites&quot; (1st)====
*&quot;Lectures on the Religion of the Semites. Fundamental Institutions. First Series&quot; (London: Adam &amp; Charles Black 1889); second edition [posthumous], edited by J. S. Black (1894), reprint 1956 by Meridian Library, New York; third edition, introduced and additional notes by S. A. Cook (1927), reprint 1969 by Ktav, New York, with prolegomenon by James Muilenberg.
**This well-known work seeks to reconstruct from scattered documents the several common religious practices and associated social behavior of the ancient Semitic peoples, i.e., of Mesopotamia, Syria, Phoenicia, Israel, Arabia [1, 9–10]. The book thus provides the contemporary historical context for the earlier Biblical writings.
**In two introductory lectures the author discusses primal religion and its evolution, which now seem too often to over generalize (perhaps inevitable in a pioneer work). In the first, Smith notes with caution the cuneiform records of Babylon, and the influence of ancient Egypt, then mentions pre-Islamic Arabia and the Hebrew Bible [13–14]; he discounts any possibility of &quot;a complete comparative religion of Semitic religions&quot; [15].
**In the second lecture, Smith&#x27;s comments range widely on various facets of primal religion in Semitic society, e.g., on the &quot;protected strangers&quot; (Heb: &quot;gērīm&quot;, sing. &quot;gēr&quot;; Arab: &quot;jīrān&quot;, sing. &quot;jār&quot;) who were &quot;personally free but had no political rights&quot;. Smith continues, that as the tribe protects the &quot;gēr&quot;, so does the God protect the tribe as &quot;clients&quot; who obey and so are righteous; hence the tribal God may develop into a universal Deity whose worshippers follow ethical precepts [75–81].
**Of the eleven lectures, Holy Places are discussed in lectures III to V. In the third lecture, nature gods of the land are discussed [84–113]; later jinn and their haunts are investigated [118–137], wherein the nature of totems are introduced [124–126]; then totem animals are linked to jinn [128–130], and the totem to the tribal god [137–139]. The fourth lecture discusses, e.g., the holiness and the taboos of the sanctuary. The fifth: holy waters, trees, caves, and stones.
**Sacrifices are addressed in lectures VI to XI. The sixth contains Smith&#x27;s controversial theory of communal sacrifice regarding the totem, wherein the tribe, at a collective meal of the totem animal, come to realize together a social bond together with their totem-linked tribal god [226–231]. This &quot;communion&quot; theory, shared in some regard with Wellhausen, now enjoys little strong support.
*On the cutting edge of biblical scholarship, this work builds on a narrower study by his friend professor Julius Wellhausen, &quot;Reste Arabischen Heidentums&quot; (Berlin 1887), and on other works on the religious history of the region and in general. (Smith&#x27;s Preface). The author also employs analogies drawn from James George Frazer, to apply where insufficient data existed for the ancient Semites. (Smith&#x27;s Preface). Hence Smith&#x27;s methodology was soon criticized by Theodor Nöldeke.
*Generally, the book was well received by contemporaries. It won Wellhausen&#x27;s praise. Later it would influence Émile Durkheim, Mircea Eliade, James George Frazer, Sigmund Freud, and Bronisław Malinowski.
*After 75 years Evans-Pritchard, although noting his wide influence, summarized criticism of Smith&#x27;s totemism, &quot;Bluntly, all Robertson Smith really does is to guess about a period of Semitic history about which we know almost nothing.&quot;

====&quot;The Religion of the Semites&quot; (2nd, 3rd)====
*&quot;Lectures on the Religion of the Semites. Second and Third Series&quot;, edited with an introduction by John Day (Sheffield Academic 1995).
*Based on the &#x27;newly discovered&#x27; original lecture notes of William Robertson Smith; only the first series had been prepared for publication (1889, 2d ed. 1894) by the author. (Editor&#x27;s Introduction at 11–13). Smith earlier had written that &quot;three courses of lectures&quot; were planned: the first regarding &quot;practical religious institutions&quot;, the second on &quot;the gods of Semitic heathenism&quot;, with the third focusing on the influence of Semitic monotheism. Yet because the first course of lectures (ending with sacrifice) did not finish, it left coverage of feasts and the priesthood &quot;to run over into the second course&quot;.
**Second Series [33–58]: I. Feasts; II. Priests and the Priestly Oracles; III. Diviners and Prophets.
**Third Series [59–112]: I. Semitic Polytheism (1); II. Semitic Polytheism (2); III. The Gods and the World: Cosmogony.
*An Appendix [113–142] contains contemporary press reports describing the lectures, including reports of extemporaneous comments made by Robertson Smith, which appear in neither of the two published texts derived from his lecture notes.

<doc id="644309" wikidata="Q1700838" url="?curid=644309" title="Mesogastropoda">
<text>Mesogastropoda was for many years a traditional taxonomic group of snails, an order. The order was composed mostly of sea snails, but it also included some land snails and freshwater snails, all of which were prosobranch gastropod mollusks.

This order was introduced by J. Thiele in his work from 1921, it and was used for many decades subsequently.

Recent research in malacology however has made it clear that &quot;Mesogastropoda&quot; was not a monophyletic taxon, and because of that, the taxon is no longer included in modern classifications. Nonetheless, most of the standard texts and field guides on mollusks date from the time period when this classification was still current, and therefore references to mesogastropods or Mesogastropoda are frequently encountered.

The lower taxa that were traditionally contained in Mesogastropoda are now mostly placed in the superorder Caenogastropoda. A more detailed account of the taxonomy is given in the articles on Gastropoda and Archaeogastropoda, and a recent taxonomy is laid out in Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005)

== Description ==
There are about 30,000 species that were included in this taxon. Most of them are to be found in the sea, but there are also numerous species in freshwater and even a few occur on land. Their shells have no mother-of-pearl or nacre.

Most of these snails are herbivorous, but a few are parasites or predators. The radula has seven denticles (or small teeth), which are sometimes reduced.

The Mesogastropoda are, in many ways, more developed than the Archaeogastropoda. Through torsion of the intestinal mass and a spiral movement of the body, the gill, the kidney and the osphradium (which means sensory receptor, or olfactory organ) have disappeared on the right side. These organs exist only on the left side of the animal.

The heart consists of only one atrium and one ventricle.

The nervous system is also more developed than in the Archeogastropods. The ganglia are connected with different organs through nerve pathways.

In the Mesogastropoda, the excretory and the reproductive ducts are separated (in contrast with the most primitive prosobranchs). Many members produce egg capsules, containing one to more than 1,000 eggs.

== Taxonomy ==
Here follows the taxonomy of the Mesogastropoda (according to the ITIS) (which is no longer considered valid).

The next taxonomy that was used was that of to Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997.

The current prevailing system of taxonomy is that of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005.

==Families==
* Abyssochrysidae
* Aciculidae
* Aporrhaidae 
* Asterophilidae
* Chondropomidae
* Choristeidae (the original name Choristidae was a name to be emended to Choristeidae by the ICZN to remove homonymy with Choristidae, a family of scorpionflies)
* Cingulopsidae
* Cochlostomatidae
* Diastomidae 
* Fossaridae 
* Hydrococcidae
* Iravadiidae
* Lacunidae 
* Littorinidae

<doc id="644318" wikidata="Q469198" url="?curid=644318" title="Betty Shabazz">
<text>Betty Shabazz (born Betty Dean Sanders; May 28, 1934/1936 – June 23, 1997), also known as Betty X, was an American educator and civil rights advocate. She was married to Malcolm X.

Shabazz grew up in Detroit, Michigan, where her foster parents largely sheltered her from racism. She attended the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, where she had her first encounters with racism. Unhappy with the situation in Alabama, she moved to New York City, where she became a nurse. It was there that she met Malcolm X and, in 1956, joined the Nation of Islam. The couple married in 1958.

Along with her husband, Shabazz left the Nation of Islam in 1964. She witnessed his assassination the following year. Left with the responsibility of raising six daughters as a widow, Shabazz pursued higher education, and went to work at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York.

Following the 1995 arrest of her daughter, Qubilah, for allegedly conspiring to murder Louis Farrakhan, Shabazz took in her ten-year-old grandson Malcolm. In 1997, he set fire to her apartment. Shabazz suffered severe burns and died three weeks later as a result of her injuries.

== Early life==
Betty Dean Sanders was born on May 28, 1934 or 1936, to Ollie Mae Sanders and Shelman Sandlin. Sandlin was 21 years old and Ollie Mae Sanders was a teenager; the couple were unmarried. Throughout her life, Betty Sanders maintained that she had been born in Detroit but early records — such as her high-school and college transcripts — show Pinehurst, Georgia, as her place of birth. Authorities in Georgia and Michigan have been unable to locate her birth certificate.

By most accounts, Ollie Mae Sanders abused her daughter, whom she was raising in Detroit. When Betty was about 11 years old, she was taken in by Lorenzo and Helen Malloy, a prominent businessman and his wife. Helen Malloy was a founding member of the Housewives&#x27; League of Detroit, a group of African-American women who organized campaigns to support black-owned businesses and boycott stores that refused to hire black employees. She was also a member of the National Council of Negro Women and the NAACP. The Malloys were both active members of their local Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Despite their lessons on black self-reliance, the Malloys never spoke with Sanders about racism. Looking back in 1995, Shabazz wrote: &quot;Race relations were not discussed and it was hoped that by denying the existence of race problems, the problems would go away. Anyone who openly discussed race relations was quickly viewed as a &#x27;troublemaker.&#x27;&quot; Still, two race riots during her childhood—in 1942 when the Sojourner Truth housing project was desegregated, and one the following year on Belle Isle—made up what Shabazz later called the &quot;psychological background for my formative years&quot;.

==Young adult years==
After she graduated from high school, Sanders left her foster parents&#x27; home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood at the train station crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. &quot;The minute I got off that train, I knew what she was trying to say. She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism.&quot;

Nothing had prepared Sanders for Southern racism. So long as she stayed on campus, she could avoid interacting with white people, but weekend trips into Montgomery, the nearest city, would try her patience. Black students had to wait until every white person in a store had been helped before the staff would serve them — if they received any service at all. When she complained to the Malloys, they refused to discuss the issue; in a 1989 interview, Shabazz summarized their attitude as &quot;if you&#x27;re just quiet it will go away.&quot;

Sanders&#x27; studies suffered as a result of her growing frustration. She decided to change her field of study from education to nursing. The dean of nursing, Lillian Holland Harvey, encouraged Sanders to consider studying in a Tuskegee-affiliated program at the Brooklyn State College School of Nursing in New York City. Against her foster parents&#x27; wishes, Sanders left Alabama for New York in 1953.

In New York, Sanders encountered a different form of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses. While the racial climate in New York was better than the situation in Alabama, Sanders frequently wondered whether she had merely exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice.

===Nation of Islam===
During her second year of nursing school, Sanders was invited by an older nurse&#x27;s aide to a Friday night dinner party at the Nation of Islam temple in Harlem. &quot;The food was delicious&quot;, Shabazz recalled in 1992, &quot;I&#x27;d never tasted food like that.&quot; After dinner, the woman asked Sanders to come to the Muslims&#x27; lecture. Sanders agreed. After the speech, the nurse&#x27;s aide invited Sanders to join the Nation of Islam; Sanders politely declined. When the woman asked her why she chose not to join the Nation of Islam after visiting, Sanders replied that she did not know she had been brought there to join. &quot;Besides, my mother would kill me, and additionally I don&#x27;t even understand the philosophy.&quot; The Malloys were Methodists, and when she was 13, Sanders had decided she would remain a Methodist for the rest of her life.

The nurse&#x27;s aide told Sanders about her minister, who was not at the temple that night: &quot;Just wait until you hear my minister talk. He&#x27;s very disciplined, he&#x27;s good looking, and all the sisters want him.&quot; Sanders enjoyed the food so much, she agreed to come back and meet the woman&#x27;s minister. At the second dinner, the nurse&#x27;s aide told her the minister was present and Sanders thought to herself, &quot;Big deal.&quot; 

In 1992, she recalled how her demeanor changed when she caught a glimpse of Malcolm X:
Then, I looked over and saw this man on the extreme right aisle sort of galloping to the podium. He was tall, he was thin, and the way he was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium. ... He got to the podium—and I sat up straight. I was impressed with him.

Sanders met Malcolm X again at a dinner party. The two had a long conversation about Sanders&#x27;s life: her childhood in Detroit, the racial hostility she had encountered in Alabama, and her studies in New York. He spoke to her about the condition of African Americans and the causes of racism. Sanders began to see things from a different perspective. &quot;I really had a lot of pent-up anxiety about my experience in the South,&quot; Shabazz recalled in a 1990 interview, &quot;and Malcolm reassured me that it was understandable how I felt.&quot;

Soon Sanders was attending all of Malcolm X&#x27;s lectures at Temple Number Seven in Harlem. He always sought her out afterwards, and he would ask her a lot of questions. Sanders was impressed with Malcolm X&#x27;s leadership and work ethic. She felt he was selfless when it came to helping others, but he had no one to lean on when he needed help. She thought maybe she could be that person. He also began to pressure her to join the Nation of Islam. In mid-1956, Sanders converted. Like many members of the Nation of Islam, she changed her surname to &quot;X&quot;, which represented the family name of her African ancestors whom she could never have known.

==Marriage and family==
Betty X and Malcolm X did not have a conventional courtship. One-on-one dates were contrary to the teachings of the Nation of Islam. Instead, the couple shared their &quot;dates&quot; with dozens of other members. Malcolm X frequently took groups to visit New York&#x27;s museums and libraries, and he always invited Betty X.

Although they had never discussed the subject, Betty X suspected that Malcolm X was interested in marriage. One day he called and asked her to marry him, and they were married on January 14, 1958, in Lansing, Michigan. By coincidence, Betty X became a licensed practical nurse (LPN) on the same day.

At first, their relationship followed the Nation of Islam&#x27;s strictures concerning marriage; Malcolm X set the rules and Betty X obediently followed them. In 1969, Shabazz wrote that &quot;his indoctrination was so thorough, even to me, that it has become a pattern for our [family&#x27;s] lives.&quot; Over time, the family dynamic changed, as Malcolm X made small concessions to Betty X&#x27;s demands for more independence. In 1969, Shabazz recalled:We would have little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he expected of a wife. But the first time I told him what I expected of him as a husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, &quot;Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I&#x27;ve been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening.&quot; He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.

The couple had six daughters. Their names were Attallah, born in 1958 and named after Attila the Hun; Qubilah, born in 1960 and named after Kublai Khan; Ilyasah, born in 1962 and named after Elijah Muhammad; Gamilah Lumumba, born in 1964 and named after Patrice Lumumba; and twins, Malikah and Malaak, born in 1965 after their father&#x27;s assassination and named for him.
She had 6 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

===Leaving the Nation of Islam===

On March 8, 1964, Malcolm X announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam. He and Betty X, now known as Betty Shabazz, became Sunni Muslims.

===Assassination of Malcolm X===

On February 21, 1965, in Manhattan&#x27;s Audubon Ballroom, Malcolm X began to speak to a meeting of the Organization of Afro-American Unity when a disturbance broke out in the crowd of 400. As Malcolm X and his bodyguards moved to quiet the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot Malcolm in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun. Two other men charged the stage and fired handguns, hitting Malcolm X 16 times.

Shabazz was in the audience near the stage with her daughters. When she heard the gunfire, she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body. When the shooting stopped, Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR. Police officers and Malcolm X&#x27;s associates used a stretcher to carry him up the block to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Angry onlookers caught and beat one of the assassins, who was arrested on the scene. Eyewitnesses identified two more suspects. All three men, who were members of the Nation of Islam, were convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

==After Malcolm&#x27;s assassination==

=== Immediately afterward ===
Shabazz had difficulty sleeping for weeks after Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination. She suffered from nightmares in which she relived the death of her husband. She also worried about how she would support herself and her family. The publication of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; helped, because Shabazz received half of the royalties. (Alex Haley, who assisted Malcolm X in writing the book, got the other half. After the publication of his best-seller &quot;&quot;, Haley signed over his portion of the royalties to Shabazz.)

Actor and activist Ruby Dee and Juanita Poitier (married to Sidney Poitier until 1965) established the Committee of Concerned Mothers to raise funds to buy a house and pay educational expenses for the Shabazz family. The Committee held a series of benefit concerts at which they raised $17,000. They bought a large two-family home in Mount Vernon, New York, from Congressmember Bella Abzug.

Looking back, Shabazz said she initially made an &quot;unrealistic decision&quot; to isolate herself because of the injustice of her husband&#x27;s assassination. She realized, however, that giving up because of her husband&#x27;s death would not help the world. &quot;It is impossible to create an environment for children to grow in and develop in isolation. It is imperative that one mix in society on some level and at some time.&quot;

===Pilgrimage to Mecca===
In late March 1965, Shabazz made the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj), as her husband had the year before. Recalling the experience in 1992, Shabazz wrote:

I really don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be today if I had not gone to Mecca to make Hajj shortly after Malcolm was assassinated. ... That is what helped put me back on track. ... Going to Mecca, making Hajj, was very good for me because it made me think of all the people in the world who loved me and were for me, who prayed that I would get my life back together. I stopped focusing on the people who were trying to tear me and my family apart.

Shabazz returned from Mecca with a new name that a fellow pilgrim had bestowed upon her, Bahiyah (meaning &quot;beautiful and radiant&quot;).

===Raising her family===
Raising six children by herself exhausted Shabazz. Providing for them was difficult as well. Shabazz&#x27;s share of the royalties from &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; was equivalent to an annual salary. In 1966, she sold the movie rights to the &quot;Autobiography&quot; to film-maker Marvin Worth. She began to authorize the publication of Malcolm X&#x27;s speeches, which provided another source of income.

When her daughters were enrolled in day care, Shabazz became an active member of the day care center&#x27;s parents organization, where she became very fond of the organization and where she would later start a campaign to run the organization. In time, she became the parents&#x27; representative on the school board. Several years later, she became president of the Westchester Day Care Council.

Shabazz began to accept speaking engagements at colleges and universities. She often spoke about the black nationalist philosophy of Malcolm X, but she also spoke about her role as a wife and mother. Shabazz felt that some of the images of her husband projected by the media were misrepresentations. &quot;They attempted to promote him as a violent person, a hater of whites,&quot; she explained. &quot;He was a sensitive man, a very understanding person and yes, he disliked the behavior of some whites ... He had a reality-based agenda.&quot;

As her daughters grew older, Shabazz sent them to private schools and summer camps. They joined Jack and Jill, a social club for the children of well-off African Americans.

===Advanced education===
In late 1969, Shabazz enrolled at Jersey City State College (now New Jersey City University) to complete the degree in education she left behind when she became a nurse. She completed her undergraduate studies in one year, and decided to earn a master&#x27;s degree in health administration. In 1972, Shabazz enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to pursue an Ed.D. in higher education administration and curriculum development. For the next three years, she drove from Mount Vernon to Amherst, Massachusetts, every Monday morning, and returned home Wednesday night. In July 1975, she defended her dissertation and earned her doctorate.

Shabazz joined the New York Alumnae chapter of Delta Sigma Theta in April 1974.

===Medgar Evers College===
In January 1976, Shabazz became associate professor of health sciences with a concentration in nursing at New York&#x27;s Medgar Evers College. The student body at Medgar Evers was 90 percent black and predominantly working-class, with an average age of 26. Black women made up most of the faculty, and 75 percent of the students were female, two-thirds of them mothers. These were all qualities that made Medgar Evers College attractive to Shabazz.

By 1980, Shabazz was overseeing the health sciences department, and the college president decided she could be more effective in a purely administrative position than she was in the classroom. She was promoted to Director of Institutional Advancement. In her new position, she became a booster and fund-raiser for the college. A year later, she was given tenure. In 1984, Shabazz was given a new title, Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs; she held that position at the college until her death.

===Volunteer work===

During the 1970s and 1980s, Shabazz continued her volunteer activities. In 1975, President Ford invited her to serve on the American Revolution Bicentennial Council. Shabazz served on an advisory committee on family planning for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In 1984, she hosted the New York convention of the National Council of Negro Women. Shabazz became active in the NAACP and the National Urban League and was a member of The Links. When Nelson and Winnie Mandela visited Harlem during 1990, Shabazz was asked to introduce Winnie Mandela.

Shabazz befriended Myrlie Evers-Williams, the widow of Medgar Evers, and Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr. They had the common experience of losing their activist husbands at a young age and raising their children as single mothers. The press came to refer to the three, who made numerous joint public appearances, as the &quot;Movement widows&quot;. Evers-Williams and King were frequent guests at Medgar Evers College, and Shabazz occasionally visited the King Center in Atlanta. Writing about Shabazz, Evers-Williams described her as a &quot;free spirit, in the best sense of the word. When she laughed, she had this beauty; when she smiled, it lit up the whole room.&quot;

==Louis Farrakhan==
For many years, Shabazz harbored resentment toward the Nation of Islam—and Louis Farrakhan in particular—for what she felt was their role in the assassination of her husband. Farrakhan seemed to boast of the assassination in a 1993 speech:

Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the &quot;hell&quot; business is it of yours? A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats.

In a 1994 interview, Gabe Pressman asked Shabazz whether Farrakhan &quot;had anything to do&quot; with Malcolm X&#x27;s death. She replied: &quot;Of course, yes. Nobody kept it a secret. It was a badge of honor. Everybody talked about it, yes.&quot; Farrakhan denied the allegations, stating &quot;I never had anything to do with Malcolm&#x27;s death&quot;, although he said he had &quot;created an atmosphere that allowed Malcolm to be assassinated.&quot;

In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz was charged with trying to hire a hit man to kill Farrakhan in retaliation for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah&#x27;s legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.

Qubilah accepted a plea agreement with respect to the charges, in which she maintained her innocence but accepted responsibility for her actions. Under the terms of the agreement, she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse for a two-year period in order to avoid a prison sentence. For the duration of her treatment, Qubilah&#x27;s ten-year-old son, Malcolm, was sent to live with Shabazz at her apartment in Yonkers, New York.

==Death==
On June 1, 1997, her 12-year-old grandson Malcolm set a fire in Shabazz&#x27;s apartment. Shabazz suffered burns over 80 percent of her body, and remained in intensive care for three weeks, at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. She underwent five skin-replacement operations as doctors struggled to replace damaged skin and save her life. Shabazz died of her injuries on June 23, 1997. Malcolm Shabazz was sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention for manslaughter and arson.
More than 2,000 mourners attended a memorial service for Shabazz, at New York&#x27;s Riverside Church. Many prominent leaders were present, including Coretta Scott King and Myrlie Evers-Williams, poet Maya Angelou, actor-activists Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, New York Governor George Pataki, and four New York City mayors—Abraham Beame, Ed Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani. U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman delivered a tribute from President Bill Clinton. In a statement released after Shabazz&#x27;s death, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said, &quot;She never stopped giving and she never became cynical. She leaves today the legacy of one who epitomized hope and healing.&quot;

Shabazz&#x27;s funeral service was held at the Islamic Cultural Center in New York City. Her public viewing was at the Unity Funeral Home in Harlem, the same place where Malcolm X&#x27;s viewing had taken place 32 years earlier. Shabazz was buried next to her husband, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz (Malcolm X), at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

===Memorials===
In late 1997, the Community Healthcare Network renamed one of its Brooklyn, New York, clinics the Dr. Betty Shabazz Health Center, in honor of Shabazz. The Betty Shabazz International Charter School was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1998 and named in her honor. In 2005, Columbia University announced the opening of the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center. The memorial is located in the Audubon Ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated. In March 2012, New York City co-named Broadway at the corner of West 165th Street, the corner in front of the Audubon Ballroom, Betty Shabazz Way.

==Portrayals in film and television==
Shabazz was the subject of the 2013 television movie &quot;Betty &amp; Coretta&quot;, in which she was played by Mary J. Blige. Angela Bassett portrayed her in the 1992 film &quot;Malcolm X&quot; and in a less prominent role in the 1995 film &quot;Panther&quot;. Yolanda King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, played Shabazz in the 1981 television movie &quot;Death of a Prophet&quot;, and Shabazz was portrayed by Victoria Dillard in the 2001 film &quot;Ali&quot;. Joaquina Kalukango portrays her in the 2020 film &quot;One Night in Miami...&quot;, alongside Kingsley Ben-Adir as Malcolm X. Shabazz was portrayed by Grace Porter in the second season of the 2019 TV series &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot;.

<doc id="644325" wikidata="Q1807598" url="?curid=644325" title="Lye roll">
<text>Lye rolls are a baked specialty in Germany (especially in Bavaria and Swabia), France (Alsace), Switzerland, and Austria. They are made by immersing bread rolls in a lye solution before baking. The German name, &quot;Laugengebäck&quot;, is used for any baked good dipped in lye. The perhaps best known shape is the pretzel, while rolls or buns are specifically called &quot;Laugensemmel&quot; or &quot;Kastanie&quot; (Bavarian), &quot;Laugeweckle&quot; or &quot;Laugestängle&quot; (Swabian), and &quot;Laugenwecken&quot;, &quot;Laugenbrötchen&quot; or &quot;Laugenstange&quot; (everywhere else in Germany); &quot;Laugenweckerl&quot; in Austria; &quot;Silserli&quot; or &quot;Laugenbrötli&quot; in Switzerland. In some parts of Asia they are also known as &quot;laugen rolls&quot;.

In France, the lye roll is known as a mauricette, it was invented by Paul Poulaillon in the Alsace region when he opened the first Poulaillon bakery in 1973. It was later registered as a trademark with an alternate name, Moricette, in 1985. The lard was then replaced by rapeseed oil.

==Lye==

In order to cause a Maillard reaction during baking for the characteristic browning effect, a lye roll needs to be coated with a high pH (alkaline) solution. The higher the pH, the stronger the reaction. Lye (sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH)) is a highly alkaline agent most commonly used for the purpose. However, lye is not the only way to produce the needed result: a baking soda or washing soda solution, which is easier to handle and safer to use, will provide a similar product but will not provide as strong a reaction, so the effect will be less pronounced. Lye is the strongest agent, followed by washing soda, and then baking soda.

The same solution is also used for preparing pretzels; outside of German-speaking countries they are often the only baked food commonly glazed with a lye solution.

==Presentation==
Both lye rolls and pretzels are typically covered with salt, preferably pretzel salt, a large-grained salt made from compressed smaller salt particles, which reduces the moisture absorption, and hardness of the salt grain. As a snack, lye rolls may also be sold as sandwiches or covered with baked cheese, although this is a more recent development and less common. Typically they are cut in half and buttered, as large soft pretzels often are in Germany and Switzerland as well. Other toppings for lye rolls nowadays also include poppy, sesame, and other seeds as an alternative to the usual salt.

In Germany, they are sold in many shapes and forms, with many having unique names. For example, &quot;Laugenstange&quot; (“Lye bar”) are long oval rolls, while &quot;Laugenbrötchen&quot; (“Lye rolls”) are small and round rolls.

* Other foods prepared with lye are lutefisk, hominy, and Chinese noodles

<text>Sir John Ogilvy Rennie, (13 January 1914 – 30 September 1981) was the 6th Director of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 1968 to 1973. He was once the head of the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret branch of the UK Foreign Office dedicated to pro-colonial and anti-communist propaganda during the Cold War.

==Career==
Educated at Wellington College and Balliol College, Oxford, Rennie joined an advertising agency in New York City in 1935. During World War II he worked at an organisation in Baltimore combating German propaganda.

In 1946 he joined the Foreign Office and was posted to Washington, D.C., and then to Warsaw. In 1953 he was appointed Head of the Information Research Department, a controversial body established to disseminate information about the dangers of Soviet-style communism. During the Suez Crisis he chaired a committee established to disseminate British propaganda in the Middle East. He was posted to Buenos Aires in 1958 and Washington, D.C., in 1960. He served on the Civil Service Commission in 1966; in 1968 he was appointed Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service.

On 15 January 1973, Rennie&#x27;s son Charles Tatham Ogilvy Rennie, and his daughter-in-law were arrested for an alleged involvement in the importation of large quantities of heroin from Hong Kong. Rennie resigned not long afterwards.

He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1967.

<text>France Télévisions (; stylized since 2018 as ) is the French national public television broadcaster. It is a state-owned company formed from the integration of the public television channels France 2 (formerly Antenne 2) and France 3 (formerly France Régions 3), later joined by the legally independent channels France 4 (formerly Festival), France 5 (formerly La Cinquième) and France Info.

France Télévisions is currently funded by the French Treasury and the revenue from commercial advertising. The new law on public broadcasting will phase out commercial advertising on the public television channels (at first in the evening, then gradually throughout the day).

France Télévisions is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has selected HbbTV for its interactive news, sports and weather service, and plans to add catch-up TV and social media sharing capability.

== History ==
From 1964 to 1975, French radio and television was monopolized through an organization known as the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française. In an effort to stimulate competition, the organization was split in 1975 so that France&#x27;s three television channels—TF1, Antenne 2, and FR3, would still be owned by the French government, but be operated independently from each other. However, the sale of TF1 to Bouygues in 1987 and increased competition from other new private broadcasters (such as Canal+ and La Cinq, the latter having been replaced by public channel La Cinquième after it ceased transmissions in April 1992) led to a decline in viewership for the two remaining public channels, which lost 30% of their market share between 1987 and 1989. The channels were however saved when a single director-general was appointed to manage both Antenne 2 and FR3, becoming part of a joint entity known as France Télévision. They were renamed in 1992 as France 2 and France 3, respectively.

In August 2000, France Télévisions S.A. was formed as a holding company for France&#x27;s public television channels, absorbing control of France 2, France 3, and La Cinquième (later renamed France 5). In 2004, Réseau France Outre-mer was absorbed by France Télévisions. Beginning in 2008, the President of France took the duty of naming the presidents for the French public broadcasters; they were previously nominated by the Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel. In 2013, under Francois Hollande, the previously adopted law was modified to return the power to nominate the presidents or French public broadcasters to the Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel.

<text>Sir Roy George Douglas Allen, CBE, FBA (3 June 1906 – 29 September 1983) was an English economist, mathematician and statistician, also member of the International Statistical Institute.

== Life ==

Allen was born in Worcester and educated at the Royal Grammar School Worcester, from which he won a scholarship to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He gained a First Class Honours in Mathematics, ranking top of his year as the Senior Wrangler.

He became a lecturer at the London School of Economics (LSE) later becoming Professor of Statistics. He wrote many papers and books on mathematical economics including the paper on &quot;A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value&quot; published in &quot;Economics&quot; in 1934 with Sir John Hicks.
Other books include: &quot;Mathematical Analysis for Economists&quot; (1938), &quot;Statistics for Economists&quot; (1949), &quot;Mathematical Economics&quot; (1956), and &quot;Macroeconomic Theory&quot; (1967).

Allen was knighted in 1966 for his services to economics and became president of the Royal Statistical Society, who awarded him the Guy Medal in Gold in 1978. He was also treasurer of the British Academy of which he was a fellow (FBA).

He introduced the concept of &quot;partial elasticity of substitution&quot; to economics in his 1938 book &quot;Mathematical Analysis for Economists&quot;.

Allen became a fellow of Sidney Sussex, Cambridge and died in 1983. He had a son, Jeremy, who was a co-founder of the consultancy International Planning and Research, and a grandson, Dion.

<doc id="644332" wikidata="Q2399862" url="?curid=644332" title="Ted Weems">
<text>Wilfred Theodore Wemyes (September 26, 1901 – May 6, 1963), known professionally as Ted Weems, was an American bandleader and musician. Weems&#x27;s work in music was recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

== Biography ==
Born in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, Weems learned to play the violin and trombone. Young Ted&#x27;s start in music came when he entered a contest, hoping to win a pony. He won a violin instead and his parents arranged for music lessons. He was a graduate of Lincoln School in Pittsburgh. While still in school at Lincoln, Weems organized a band there, initially providing some instruments himself. His teacher offered young Ted and his band a penny each if they would play when the alarm sounded for fire drills. Weems kept the monies of the band and in turn charged each band member a penny for membership. He used the money to purchase better instruments than those the band started out with. When the family moved to Philadelphia, young Weems entered West Philadelphia High School. He joined the school&#x27;s band and became its director.

He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he and his brother Art organized a small dance band that became the &quot;All American Band&quot;. The brothers sought the most talented college musicians for the group. The All American Band soon started receiving offers to perform in well-known hotels throughout the United States. Weems, who had originally intended to become a civil engineer, found himself being attracted to a musical career. His band had a contract to play four weeks at a Philadelphia restaurant; the owner was able to keep Weems and his band there for four months by making Ted a partner in his business. They were one of the bands that played at the inaugural ball of President Warren G Harding in March, 1921. Going professional in 1923, Weems toured for the MCA Corporation and began recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company. &quot;Somebody Stole My Gal&quot; became the band&#x27;s first #1 hit in early 1924. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

Weems recorded for Victor/RCA Victor from 1923 through 1933, although the final three sessions were released on RCA Victor&#x27;s newly created Bluebird Records label. He then signed with Columbia for two sessions in 1934 and subsequently signed with Decca from 1936. Weems also co-wrote several popular songs: &quot;The Martins and the McCoys&quot;, &quot;Jig Time&quot;, &quot;The One-Man Band&quot;, &quot;Three Shif&#x27;less Skonks&quot;, and &quot;Oh, Monah!&quot;, which he co-wrote with band member &quot;Country&quot; Washburn.

Weems moved to Chicago with his band around 1928. The Ted Weems Orchestra had more chart success in 1929 with the novelty song &quot;Piccolo Pete&quot;, which rewarded him with his second gold record, and the number one hit &quot;The Man from the South&quot;. The band gained popularity in the 1930s, making regular radio broadcasts. These included Jack Benny&#x27;s Canada Dry program on CBS and NBC during the early 1930s, and the &quot;Fibber McGee &amp; Molly&quot; program in the late 1930s.

In 1936, the Ted Weems Orchestra gave young singer Perry Como his first national exposure; Como recorded with the band for Decca Records, beginning his long and successful career. Among Weems&#x27;s other discoveries were whistler-singer Elmo Tanner, sax player and singer Red Ingle, Marilyn Maxwell, who left the band for an acting career; and arranger Joe Haymes, who created the band&#x27;s unique jazz-novelty style. Weems also signed 14-year-old ventriloquist Paul Winchell to a contract, after seeing him with one of the Major Bowes touring companies. The first season of the &quot;Beat the Band&quot; radio show (1940–1941) included Weems and his orchestra as part of the cast. 

In 1940, Weems and his orchestra were featured on &quot;Beat the Band&quot; on the NBC-Red radio network.

In November 1942, Ted Weems and his entire band enlisted in the United States Merchant Marine, directing the Merchant Marine Band. Reorganizing his big band in 1945, he made records for Mercury, including the hits &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart&quot; and &quot;Mickey&quot;. However, the biggest hit of Weems&#x27;s career was a reissue on his former Decca label: the Weems Orchestra&#x27;s 1938 recording of &quot;Heartaches&quot; topped the national charts for 13 weeks. 
For his August 4, 1933 session, Weems recorded six tunes, including &quot;Heartaches&quot;. Since RCA Victor wanted the recording made quickly, Weems and his band had time for only one rehearsal session prior to this. Weems did not like the song at first, and decided to have Elmo Tanner whistle rather than use a vocalist. While rehearsing, someone came up with the idea of trying the song at a faster tempo than it was written for. The fast-tempo recording attracted very little attention after its release. 

In 1938 Weems recorded a new &quot;rhumba fox trot&quot; version of &quot;Heartaches&quot; for Decca Records. This version again featured Elmo Tanner&#x27;s whistling, and the tune was played briskly but not at the breakneck tempo of the 1933 version. In 1947, an overnight disc jockey named Kurt Webster, at station WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina, found the 1938 version in a box of old records he had recently received. He played it on the air and the radio station&#x27;s phones never stopped ringing; the callers wanted to hear the song again. The calls continued, now joined by record stores wanting to know how to order copies of the record. Other radio markets began playing the song, prompting Decca to press new copies. Since the Weems orchestra had also recorded &quot;Heartaches&quot; for Victor, that company decided to re-release its own version of the song. Both labels shared credit on the charts. &quot;Heartaches&quot; topped the Hit Parade on April 19, 1947; nine years after it was recorded. In a 1960 interview, band member Elmo Tanner related that he and Weems received nothing for the reissue as both men had let their contracts expire while they were in the Merchant Marine. 

The new-found popularity of the 1938 &quot;Heartaches&quot; came at a time when Weems was struggling to re-form his band; many former members had other music-related jobs, others were no longer interested in performing. Two of his band members were killed in World War II. Weems was then able to recruit new band members and was again being asked to play at the same venues as before the war. Ted Weems made front-page news in 1947 when he publicly repaid his debt to disc jockey Kurt Webster, who had revived &quot;Heartaches&quot; and thus Weems&#x27;s career. Weems staged a benefit performance by his band on June 6, with all proceeds going to war veteran Webster. Decca cashed in on Weems&#x27;s new popularity by reissuing another oldie, &quot;I Wonder Who&#x27;s Kissing Her Now&quot; with vocals by Perry Como, which became another major chart hit. 

Despite this sudden surge of popularity for Weems, the hits dried up after 1947. Weems continued touring until 1953. At that time, he accepted a disc jockey position in Memphis, Tennessee, later moving on to a management position with the Holiday Inn hotel chain. Perry Como played host to his old boss, Elmo Tanner, and three other Weems band members on his &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Kraft Music Hall&quot; show of October 18, 1961.

Ted Weems died of emphysema in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1963. He had been operating a talent agency in Dallas with his son which also served as his band&#x27;s headquarters. Weems was in Tulsa with his band for an engagement the day he was taken ill. His son Ted Jr. led a revival band sporadically during the 1960s and 1970s.

<text>Jérémie-Jacques Oberlin (8 August 1735 – 10 October 1806) was a philologist and archaeologist from Alsace. He was also known as Jeremias Jakob Oberlin in German.

The brother of Jean Frédéric Oberlin, he was born at Strasbourg. While studying theology at the university he devoted special attention to Biblical archaeology. In 1755 he was chosen professor at the gymnasium of his native town, in 1763 librarian to the university, in 1770 professor of rhetoric, and in 1782 of logic and metaphysics.

Oberlin published several manuals on archaeology and ancient geography, and made frequent excursions into different provinces of France to investigate antiquarian remains and study provincial dialects, the result appearing in &quot;Essai sur le patois Lorrain&quot; (1775); &quot;Dissertations sur les Minnesingers&quot; (1782–1789); and &quot;Observations concernant le patois et les mœurs des gens de la campagne&quot; (1791). He also published several editions of Latin authors and copied manuscripts by Gottfried von Hagenau, the originals of which are now lost.

<doc id="644344" wikidata="Q212048" url="?curid=644344" title="Glenn Ford">
<text>Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford (May 1, 1916 – August 30, 2006), known as Glenn Ford, was a Canadian-born American actor. He was most prominent during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age as one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and had a career that lasted more than 50 years.

Ford often portrayed ordinary men in unusual circumstances. Although he starred in many genres of film, some of his most significant roles were in the film noirs &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953), and the high school drama &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955). However, it was for comedies or westerns that he received acting laurels, including three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, winning for &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; (1961). He also played a supporting role as Superman&#x27;s mild-mannered alter-ego Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive farmer father, Jonathan Kent, in the first film of the franchise series &quot;Superman&quot; (1978).

Five of his films have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically&quot; significant: &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946), &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953), &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955), &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (1957) and &quot;Superman&quot; (1978).

==Early life==
Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford was born on May 1, 1916, in Sainte-Christine-d&#x27;Auvergne, Quebec, Canada the son of Hannah Wood (&quot;née&quot; Mitchell) and Newton Ford, an engineer with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Through his father, Ford was a great-nephew of Canada&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and was also related to America&#x27;s eighth President Martin Van Buren (1782–1862, served 1837–1841). In 1922, when Ford was age six, the family emigrated southwest across the border into the United States, first to Venice, California, and then to Santa Monica, west of Los Angeles; his father, Newton became a motorman on a tram / streetcar for the Venice Electric Tram Company, a job he held until he died at age 50 in 1940, when his son Glenn was age 24.

While attending Santa Monica High School, Glen was active in school drama productions with other future actors such as James Griffith. After graduation around 1934, he began working in small theatre groups. While in high school, he took odd jobs, including working for future famous comedian / entertainer Will Rogers, who taught him horsemanship. Ford later commented that his father had no objection to his growing interest in acting, but told him, &quot;It&#x27;s all right for you to try to act, if you learn something else first. Be able to take a car apart and put it together. Be able to build a house, every bit of it. Then you&#x27;ll always have something.&quot; Ford heeded the paternal advice and decades later during the 1950s, when he was one of Hollywood&#x27;s most popular actors, he regularly worked on plumbing, wiring, and air conditioning at his home.

At age 23, Ford gave up his status as a subject of the King (Canadian citizenship) and became a naturalized citizen of the United States on November 10, 1939, taking the oath of allegiance.

==Early career==
===Columbia Pictures===
Ford acted in West Coast stage companies and had a role in the short &quot;Night in Manhattan&quot; (1937) before joining Columbia Pictures in 1939. His stage name came from his father&#x27;s hometown of Glenford, Alberta.

His first major movie part was in &quot;Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence&quot; (1939) at 20th Century Fox studios, written by Dalton Trumbo. Ford&#x27;s first movie for Columbia was a &quot;B&quot;, &quot;My Son Is Guilty&quot; (1939). He went on to other &quot;B&quot; movies such as &quot;Convicted Woman&quot; (1940), &quot;Men Without Souls&quot; (1940), &quot;Babies for Sale&quot; (1940) and &quot;Blondie Plays Cupid&quot; (1941).

Ford was in the bigger budgeted &quot;The Lady in Question&quot; (1940), which co-starred Rita Hayworth. This was a well-received courtroom drama in which Ford plays a young man who falls in love with Rita Hayworth when his father, Brian Aherne, tries to rehabilitate her in their bicycle shop. Directed by Hungarian emigre Charles Vidor, the two rising young stars instantly bonded.

===&quot;So Ends Our Night&quot;===
Top Hollywood director John Cromwell was impressed enough with his work to borrow him from Columbia for the independently produced drama, &quot;So Ends Our Night&quot; (1941), where Ford delivered a poignant portrayal of a 19-year-old German exile on the run in Nazi-occupied Europe.

Working with Academy Award-winning Fredric March and wooing (onscreen) 30-year-old Margaret Sullivan, (who had been nominated for an Academy Award &quot;Oscar&quot; for 1938&#x27;s Three Comrades), Ford&#x27;s portrayal of a shy, ardent young refugee riveted attention even in such stellar company. &quot;Glenn Ford, a most promising newcomer,&quot; wrote &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Bosley Crowther in a review on February 28, 1941, &quot;draws more substance and appealing simplicity from his role of the boy than any one else in the cast.&quot;

After the film&#x27;s highly publicized premiere in Los Angeles and a gala fundraiser in Miami, President Franklin D. Roosevelt saw the film in a private screening at the White House, and admired the film greatly. Young Ford was invited to Roosevelt&#x27;s annual Birthday Ball. Inspired and enthused by the President, he returned to Los Angeles and promptly registered as a Democrat and a fervent FDR supporter. &quot;I was so impressed when I met Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt,&quot; recalled Glenn Ford to his son decades later, &quot;I was thrilled when I got back to Los Angeles and found a beautiful photograph personally autographed to me. It always held a place of high honor in my home.&quot;

After 35 interviews and glowing reviews for him personally, Glenn Ford soon had young female fans begging for his autograph, too. However, the young man was disappointed when Columbia Pictures did nothing with this prestige and new visibility and instead kept plugging him into conventional films for the rest of his 7-year contract. His next picture &quot;Texas&quot; was his first Western, a genre with which he would be associated for the rest of his life. Set after the American Civil War, it paired him with another young male star also under contract, William Holden, who became a lifelong friend. More routine films followed, none of them memorable, but lucrative enough to allow Ford to buy his mother and himself a beautiful new home in the Pacific Palisades community..

&quot;So Ends Our Night&quot; also affected the young star in another way: in the summer of 1941, while the United States was still neutral in the Second World War, he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, though he had a class 3 deferment (for being his mother&#x27;s sole support). He began his training in September 1941, driving three nights a week to his waterfront unit in San Pedro and spending most weekends there.

He continued to appear in movies for Columbia such as &quot;Go West, Young Lady&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Adventures of Martin Eden&quot; (1942).

===World War II and Eleanor Powell===

Ten months after Ford&#x27;s portrait of a young anti-Nazi exile, the United States entered World War II with the Imperial Japanese surprise attack on the Pearl Harbor naval and air bases in Hawaii. After playing a young pilot in his 11th Columbia film, &quot;Flight Lieutenant&quot; (1942), Ford went on a cross-country 12-city tour to sell war bonds for Army and Navy Relief. In the midst of the many stars also donating their time – from Bob Hope to Cary Grant to Claudette Colbert – he met the popular dancing star Eleanor Powell. The two soon fell in love; they attended the official opening of the Hollywood USO canteen together in October.

Ford made &quot;The Desperadoes&quot; (1942), another Western. Then, while making another war drama, &quot;Destroyer&quot; with ardent anti-fascist Edward G. Robinson, Ford impulsively volunteered for the United States Marine Corps Reserve on December 13, 1942. The startled studio had to beg the Marines to give their second male lead four more weeks to complete shooting on their picture. In the meantime, Ford proposed to Eleanor Powell, who subsequently announced her retirement from the screen to be near her fiancé as he started Marine Corps boot camp.

Ford recalled later to his son that his friend William Holden, who had joined the U.S. Army Air Corps, and Ford had &quot;talked about it and we were both convinced that our careers, which were just getting established, would likely be forgotten by the time we got back ... if we got back.&quot;

He was assigned in March 1943 to active duty at the Marine Corps Base in San Diego. With his Coast Guard service, he was offered a position as a Marine Corps officer, but Ford declined, feeling it would be interpreted as preferential treatment for a movie star and instead entered the Marines as a private. He trained at the Marine base in San Diego, where Tyrone Power, the number-one male movie star at the time, was also based. Power suggested Ford join him in the Marines&#x27; weekly radio show &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot;, broadcast Sunday evenings from San Diego. Ford excelled in training, winning the Rifle Marksman Badge, being named &quot;Honor Man&quot; of the platoon and being promoted to sergeant by the time he finished.

Awaiting assignment at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base, Ford volunteered to play a Marine raider – uncredited – in the film &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot;, made by Fox, with Ford and others charging up the beaches of Southern California. He later showed this to his little boy Peter, along with his many other black-and-white battle scenes in other films. Frustratingly for Ford, filming battle scenes was the closest he would ever get to any enemy action. After being sent to Marine Corps Schools Detachment (Photographic Section) in Quantico, Virginia, three months later, Ford returned to the San Diego base in February 1944 and was assigned to the radio section of the Public Relations Office, Headquarters Company, Base Headquarters Battalion, where he resumed work on the &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; film.

Just as Eleanor, now his wife, was expecting the birth of their child and Ford himself was looking forward to Officers Training School, he was hospitalized at the U.S. Naval Hospital in San Diego with what turned out to be duodenal ulcers, which afflicted him for the rest of his life. He was in and out of the hospital for the next five months and finally received a medical discharge on the third anniversary of Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1944. Though without the combat duty he had been hoping for, Ford was awarded several service medals for his three years in the Marines Reserve Corps: the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal, created in 1945 for anyone who had been on active duty since December 1941.
After the war, Ford continued his military career in the U.S. Naval Reserve well into the Vietnam War era, achieving the rank of captain.

===&quot;Gilda&quot;===
The most memorable role of Ford&#x27;s early career came with his first postwar film in 1946, starring alongside Rita Hayworth in &quot;Gilda&quot;. This was Glenn Ford&#x27;s second pairing with Hayworth; like the first it was directed by Charles Vidor.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; movie reviewer Bosley Crowther did not much like or, as he freely admitted, even understand the movie, but he noted that Ford had &quot;just returned from war duty&quot; and did show &quot;a certain stamina and poise in the role of a tough young gambler.&quot;

Reviewing the film in 1946, Crowther did not yet have the phrase with which &quot;Gilda&quot; would soon be associated, a term that French critics had not even invented in 1946: film noir. The erotic sadism and covert homoeroticism were actively encouraged on set by director Vidor, a sophisticated Budapest-born expatriate, though Glenn Ford always denied any awareness of the latter in his character&#x27;s fervent loyalty to his boss, who had unwittingly married the love of Johnny&#x27;s life.
The film was entered in the Cannes Film Festival in France, then in its first year. Ford went on to be a leading man opposite Hayworth in a total of five films. and after their location romance (his marriage survived, hers did not) the two became lifelong friends and next-door neighbors, and lovers. Beautifully shot in black-and-white by cinematographer Rudolph Mate, &quot;Gilda&quot; has endured as a classic of film noir. It has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and, in 2013, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===Leading star===
Now established as a star of &quot;A&quot; movies, Ford was borrowed by Warner Bros studios to play Bette Davis&#x27; leading man in &quot;A Stolen Life&quot; (1946). Back at Columbia he was in &quot;Gallant Journey&quot; (1946), a biopic of John Joseph Montgomery; then he did a thriller &quot;Framed&quot; (1947) and a comedy, &quot;The Mating of Millie&quot; (1948). He and Hayworth were reunited with Vidor in the expensive color filming of the drama, &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (1948).

Ford appeared in a comedy, &quot;The Return of October&quot; (1948) and a popular Western &quot;The Man from Colorado&quot; (1948). The latter co-starred William Holden. Both Ford and his friend William Holden flourished throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but Ford was frustrated that he was not given the opportunity to work with directors of the caliber that Holden did in his Oscar-winning career, such as Billy Wilder and David Lean. He missed out on &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; – as did Rita Hayworth – when production was stalled by Columbia studio head Harry Cohn. He also made the mistake, which he bitterly regretted later, of turning down the lead in the brilliant comedy &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (also planned with Rita Hayworth), which Holden then snatched up.

Columbia kept Ford constantly busy: &quot;The Undercover Man&quot; (1949), a film noir; &quot;Lust for Gold&quot; (1949), a Western with Ida Lupino; and &quot;Mr. Soft Touch&quot; (1949), with Evelyn Keyes - another crime mystery / film noir. MGM borrowed him for &quot;The Doctor and the Girl&quot; (1950), and he went over to RKO Studios for &quot;The White Tower&quot; (1950).

Back at Columbia, Ford did &quot;Convicted&quot; (1950) with Broderick Crawford and &quot;The Flying Missile&quot;, a Cold War era movie.

==Freelance star==

Ford went to Paramount for &quot;The Redhead and the Cowboy&quot; (1951) and Fox for &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (1951) where he played Ben Hogan, and the Western &quot;The Secret of Convict Lake&quot; (1951). At United Artists he starred in &quot;The Green Glove&quot; (1952) then MGM called him back for &quot;Young Man with Ideas&quot; (1952).

Ford was reunited with Rita Hayworth a third time in &quot;Affair in Trinidad&quot; (1952). He went to Britain to star in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Time Bomb&quot; (1953) then to Universal for the Western &quot;The Man from the Alamo&quot; (1953).

Ford made &quot;Plunder of the Sun&quot; (1953) with John Farrow, then was cast in the lead of &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953), Fritz Lang&#x27;s classic crime melodrama with Gloria Grahame, at Columbia. After &quot;Appointment in Honduras&quot; (1953) at RKO, Ford reunited with Lang and Grahame in &quot;Human Desire&quot; (1954). Ford did two Westerns, &quot;The Americano&quot; (1955) at RKO and &quot;The Violent Men&quot; (1955) at Columbia.

==MGM==
===&quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;===
Ford&#x27;s career went up another notch when cast in the lead of &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955), a landmark film of teen angst at MGM. Unlike the comparatively white-bread &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;The Wild One, Blackboard Jungle&quot; tackled racial conflicts head-on. Ford played an idealistic, harassed teacher at an urban high school that included a very young Sidney Poitier and other black and Hispanic cast members. Vic Morrow played a dangerous juvenile delinquent. Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; under the opening credits was the first use of a rock and roll song in a Hollywood film. Richard Brooks, the film&#x27;s writer and director, had discovered the music when he heard Ford&#x27;s son Peter playing the record at Glenn Ford&#x27;s home.

The movie was a huge hit and MGM signed Ford to a long-term contract. They put him in &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot; (1955) a biopic of Marjorie Lawrence with Eleanor Parker, and another big success; so too were the dramas &quot;Trial&quot; (1956) and &quot;Ransom!&quot; (1956).

Ford returned to Columbia for the Western &quot;Jubal&quot; (1956), then back at MGM made another Western, the hugely popular &quot;The Fastest Gun Alive&quot; (1956).

===Comedy===
Ford&#x27;s versatility allowed him to star in a number of popular comedies, often as a beleaguered, well-meaning but nonplussed straight man facing difficult circumstances. In &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; (1956), he played an American soldier who is sent to Okinawa to convert the occupied island&#x27;s natives to the American way of life but is instead converted by them.

All of Ford&#x27;s starring vehicles in this era became hits: the Columbia Western &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (1957), the MGM military comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot; (1957) and &quot;Cowboy&quot; (1958) with Jack Lemmon at Columbia.

Ford first worked with director George Marshall in &quot;The Sheepman&quot; (1958), a popular MGM Western. They reteamed for the service comedy &quot;Imitation General&quot; (1958) and the war film &quot;Torpedo Run&quot; (1958). He and Marshall made two comedies with Debbie Reynolds: &quot;It Started with a Kiss&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Gazebo&quot; (1959). At the end of the 1950s, Ford was among the greatest stars in Hollywood.

==1960s==
Ford&#x27;s first financial flop since he had reached star status was the epic Western &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960). He appeared in some comedies, including &quot;Cry for Happy&quot; (1961) with Marshall and &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; (1961) with Frank Capra, but neither was as well-received as were his comedies from the previous decade. Ford was cast in the lead of &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (1961), a notorious box office fiasco.

Ford&#x27;s box office standing recovered with the thriller &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot; (1962) and the comedy &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (1963). Less popular were the comedies &quot;Love Is a Ball&quot; (1963) and &quot;Advance to the Rear&quot; (1964), the latter directed by Marshall. He was in the drama &quot;Fate Is the Hunter&quot; (1964) and the romantic comedy &quot;Dear Heart&quot; (1964).

Ford made two films with Burt Kennedy &quot;The Rounders&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Money Trap&quot; (1965). He was one of many famous faces in &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966) and went to Mexico for &quot;Rage&quot; (1966).
Ford was in some Westerns: &quot;A Time for Killing&quot; (1967), &quot;The Last Challenge&quot; (1967), &quot;Day of the Evil Gun&quot; (1968), &quot;Smith!&quot; (1968), and &quot;Heaven with a Gun&quot; (1969).

==Later career==
In 1976, Ford played Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance in the epic &quot;Midway&quot; alongside Henry Fonda, who portrayed Admiral Chester Nimitz, and Charlton Heston, who played the fictional captain Matt Garth. In 1978, Ford had a supporting role in &quot;Superman&quot; as Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive father Jonathan Kent.

=== Later military service ===
Following his abbreviated World War II-era service, Ford returned to the military in 1958. He received a direct commission as a lieutenant commander in the United States Naval Reserve (a nominally junior yet relatively high rank that took Ford&#x27;s Hollywood imprimatur into consideration, given his conspicuous lack of an undergraduate degree amid the contemporaneous Cold War-era emphasis on education in the officer ranks of United States Armed Forces) and was initially assigned as a public affairs officer (the same role held by his character in the successful comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot;). During his annual training tours, he promoted the Navy through radio and television broadcasts, personal appearances and documentary films.

Ford continued to combine his film career with his military service and was promoted to commander in 1963. He was again promoted to captain in 1968 after visiting South Vietnam in 1967 for a month&#x27;s tour of duty as a location scout for combat scenes in a training film entitled &quot;Global Marine&quot;. In support of President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s escalation of the Vietnam War, he traveled with a combat camera crew from the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone south to the Mekong Delta. For his service in Vietnam, the Navy awarded him a Navy Commendation Medal. He retired from the Naval Reserve in the 1970s at the rank of captain. Additionally, he was awarded the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, which recognizes those who complete ten years of honorable reserve service, in 1968.

=== Television ===
In 1971, Ford signed with CBS to star in his first television series, a half-hour comedy/drama titled &quot;The Glenn Ford Show&quot;. However, CBS head Fred Silverman suggested a Western series instead, which resulted in the series &quot;Cade&#x27;s County&quot;. Ford played southwestern Sheriff Cade for one season (1971–1972) in a mix of police mystery and Western drama.

In &quot;The Family Holvak&quot; (1975–1976), Ford portrayed a Depression-era preacher in a family drama, reprising the same character that he had played in the TV film &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;. In 1978, Ford was host, presenter and narrator of the disaster documentary series &quot;When Havoc Struck&quot; for the Mobil Showcase Network. In 1981, Ford costarred with Melissa Sue Anderson in the slasher film &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot;.

In 1991, Ford agreed to star in the cable network series &quot;African Skies&quot;. However, prior to the start of the series, he developed blood clots in his legs that required a lengthy stay at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Eventually he recovered, but at one time his situation was so severe that he was listed in critical condition. Ford was forced to withdraw from the series and was replaced by Robert Mitchum.

=== Radio ===
In 1950, Ford played the title role in &quot;The Adventures of Christopher London,&quot; created by Erle Stanley Gardner and directed by William N. Robson. London was a private investigator in the weekly adventure series, which ran on Sundays at 7 p.m. on the NBC radio network from January 22 to April 30, 1950.

==Personal life==

Ford&#x27;s first wife was actress and dancer Eleanor Powell (1943–1959), with whom he had his only child, actor Peter Ford (b. 1945). The couple appeared together on screen once in a short film produced in the 1950s titled &quot;Have Faith in Our Children&quot;. When they married, Powell was more famous than Ford. They divorced in 1959.

Ford did not remain on good terms with his ex-wives. He was a notorious womanizer who had affairs with many of his leading ladies, including Rita Hayworth, Maria Schell, Geraldine Brooks, Stella Stevens, Gloria Grahame, Gene Tierney, Eva Gabor and Barbara Stanwyck. He had a one-night stand with Marilyn Monroe in 1962 and a fling with Joan Crawford in the early 1940s.

Ford dated Christiane Schmidtmer, Linda Christian and Vikki Dougan during the mid-1960s, and he also had relationships with Judy Garland, Connie Stevens, Suzanne Pleshette, Rhonda Fleming, Roberta Collins, Susie Lund, Terry Moore, Angie Dickinson, Debbie Reynolds, Jill St. John, Brigitte Bardot and Loretta Young. However, he subsequently married actress Kathryn Hays (1966–1969); marriages to Cynthia Hayward (1977–1984) and Jeanne Baus (1993–1994) would later follow. However, all four marriages ended in divorce. He also had a long-term relationship with actress Hope Lange in the early 1960s. According to his son Peter Ford&#x27;s book &quot;Glenn Ford: A Life (2011)&quot;, Ford had affairs with 146 actresses, all of which were documented in his personal diaries, including a 40-year, intermittent affair with Rita Hayworth that began during the filming of &quot;Gilda&quot; in 1945. Their affair resumed during the making of their 1948 film &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot;. Ford had also been engaged to Debra Morris in the 1980s and Karen Johnson in the early 1990s.

In 1960, Ford moved to a home next to Hayworth&#x27;s residence in Beverly Hills; they continued their relationship until the early 1980s.

Ford&#x27;s affair with stripper and cult actress Liz Renay was chronicled by her in the 1991 book &quot;My First 2,000 Men.&quot; She ranked Ford as one of her top five best lovers.
Ford also documented his many relationships by taping every phone conversation with all of his celebrity lovers and friends for 40 years. Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan are on these recordings, as well as Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra, William Holden, John Wayne, Cary Grant, Ava Gardner, Gregory Peck, James Mason, Lucille Ball, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Angie Dickinson, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Charlton Heston and Debbie Reynolds. Ford installed the recording system to eavesdrop on the conversations of his first wife Eleanor Powell, fearing that she would discover his serial cheating and leave him. She divorced him in 1959 on grounds of adultery and mental cruelty.

At the height of his stardom, Glenn Ford supported the Democratic Party. He supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s, Adlai Stevenson II in 1956 and John F. Kennedy in 1960. Ford later switched his support to the Republican Party. He campaigned for his old friend and fellow actor Ronald Reagan in the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections.

In May 1980, Ford attempted to purchase the Atlanta Flames of the National Hockey League, with the intention of keeping the team in the city. He was prepared to match a $14 million offer made by Byron and Daryl Seaman, but was outbid by an investment group led by Nelson Skalbania, which included the Seaman brothers. The group acquired the franchise for $16 million on May 23 and eventually moved it to Calgary.

Ford lived in Beverly Hills, California, where he illegally raised 140 leghorn chickens until he was stopped by the Beverly Hills Police Department.

==Death==
Ford retired from acting in 1991 at age 75 with heart and circulatory problems. He suffered a series of minor strokes that left him in frail health in the years preceding his death. He died at his Beverly Hills home on August 30, 2006, at the age of 90.

==Awards==
After being nominated in 1957, 1958 and in 1962, Ford won a Golden Globe Award as Best Actor for his performance in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Pocketful of Miracles,&quot; a remake of &quot;Lady for a Day (1933)&quot; that Ford helped produce.

Ford was listed in Quigley&#x27;s Annual List of Top Ten Box Office Champions in 1956, 1958 and 1959, topping the list in 1958. For 10 consecutive years from 1955 through 1964, Ford was listed among Quigley&#x27;s list of the top 25 box-office stars.

In 1958, Ford won the Golden Laurel Award for Top Male Comedy Performance for his role in &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot;.

For his contribution to the motion-picture industry, Ford has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6933 Hollywood Blvd. In 1978, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1987, he received the Donostia Award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, and in 1992, he was awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; medal for his actions in World War II.

Ford was scheduled to make his first public appearance in 15 years at a 90th-birthday tribute gala in his honor hosted by the American Cinematheque at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood on May 1, 2006. However, at the last minute, it was decided that he was too ill to attend. Anticipating during the previous week that his health might prevent his attendance, Ford had recorded a special filmed message for the audience, which was screened after a series of in-person tributes from friends including Martin Landau, Shirley Jones, Jamie Farr and Debbie Reynolds.

Asteroid 3852 Glennford is named in honour of Ford.

==Legacy==
In a 1981 interview, Ford said his favorites of his own films were &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot;, &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;Cowboy&quot;, &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, &quot;The Sheepman&quot; and &quot;The Gazebo&quot;. &quot;They may not have been the best pictures I did, but they&#x27;re the ones I remember most fondly because of the people involved,&quot; he said. &quot;People like George Marshall, who directed six pictures with me, and Debbie Reynolds.&quot;

<doc id="644348" wikidata="Q960794" url="?curid=644348" title="USS Macon (ZRS-5)">
<text>USS &quot;Macon&quot; (ZRS-5) was a rigid airship built and operated by the United States Navy for scouting and served as a &quot;flying aircraft carrier&quot;, carrying up to five single-seat Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk parasite biplanes for scouting or two-seat Fleet N2Y-1s for training. In service for less than two years, the &quot;Macon&quot; was damaged in a storm and lost off California&#x27;s Big Sur coast in February 1935, though most of the crew were saved. The wreckage is listed as the USS &quot;Macon&quot; Airship Remains on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Less than shorter than the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, both &quot;Macon&quot; and her sister ship were among the largest flying objects in the world in terms of length and volume. Although the hydrogen-filled, Zeppelin-built &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; were both longer, the two American-built naval airships still hold the world record for largest helium-filled rigid airships.

==Construction==
USS &quot;Macon&quot; was built at the Goodyear Airdock in Springfield Township, Ohio, by the Goodyear–Zeppelin Corporation at a cost of $2.45 million (equivalent to $ million in ) under a fixed-price contract. Because this was by far the biggest airship ever to be built in America, a team of experienced German airship engineers—led by Chief Designer Karl Arnstein—instructed and supported design and construction of both the U.S. Navy airships &quot;Akron&quot; and &quot;Macon&quot;.

&quot;Macon&quot; had a structured duraluminum with three interior keels. The airship was kept aloft by 12 helium-filled gas cells made from gelatin-latex fabric. Inside the hull, the ship had eight German-made Maybach VL II 12-cylinder, gasoline-powered engines that drove outside propellers. The propellers could be rotated down or backwards, providing an early form of thrust vectoring to control the ship during takeoff and landings. The rows of slots in the hull above each engine were part of a system to condense out the water vapor from the engine exhaust gases for use as buoyancy compensation ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed.

==Service history==

===Christening and commissioning===
&quot;Macon&quot; was christened on 11 March 1933, by Jeanette Whitton Moffett, wife of Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics. The airship was named after the city of Macon, Georgia, which was the largest city in the Congressional district of Carl Vinson, then the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; Committee on Naval Affairs.

The airship first flew on 21 April, aloft over northern Ohio for nearly 13 hours with 105 aboard, just over a fortnight after the loss of &quot;Akron&quot; in which Admiral Moffett and 72 others were killed. &quot;Macon&quot; was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 23 June 1933, with Commander Alger H. Dresel in command.

===1933===
On 24 June 1933, &quot;Macon&quot; left Goodyear&#x27;s field for Naval Air Station (NAS) Lakehurst, New Jersey, where the new airship was based for the summer while undergoing a series of training flights.

&quot;Macon&quot; had a far more productive career than &quot;Akron&quot;, which crashed on 4 April 1933. The commanders of &quot;Macon&quot; developed the doctrine and techniques of using her on-board aircraft for scouting while the airship remained out of sight of the opposing forces during exercises. &quot;Macon&quot; participated in several fleet exercises, though the men who framed and conducted the exercises lacked an understanding of the airship&#x27;s capabilities and weaknesses. It became standard practice to remove the landing gear of the Sparrowhawks while aboard the airship and then replace it with a fuel tank, thus giving the aircraft 30 percent more range.

&quot;Macon&quot; first operated aircraft on 6 July 1933 during trial flights out of Lakehurst, New Jersey. The planes were stored in bays inside the hull and were launched and retrieved using a trapeze.

The airship left the East Coast on 12 October 1933, on a transcontinental flight to her new permanent homebase at NAS Sunnyvale (now Moffett Federal Airfield) near San Francisco in Santa Clara County, California.

===1934===
In 1934, two two-seat Waco UBF XJW-1 biplanes equipped with skyhooks were delivered to USS &quot;Macon&quot;.

In June 1934, Lieutenant Commander Herbert V. Wiley took command of the airship, and planned a high-profile demonstration of the ability of the &quot;Macon&quot; to successfully locate enemy ships at sea. In July, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was travelling aboard the heavy cruiser to Hawaii, accompanied by the . Despite the location of the ship being top secret (and having made a detour to Clipperton Island after transiting the Panama Canal), the &quot;Macon&quot; successfully located the ships on July 19. Using the &quot;Macon&quot; Sparrowhawk biplanes, newspapers and magazines were dropped to the president on the ship.

Despite its success, Fleet Commander Admiral Joseph M. Reeves and other Navy officials were displeased with the unsanctioned demonstration. However, Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, who was in command of the Naval Bureau of Aviation, and the president were impressed. A communication from the &quot;Houston&quot; to the &quot;Macon&quot; after the mail delivery read: &quot;from &quot;Houston&quot;: 1519 The President compliments you and your planes on your fine performance and excellent navigation 1210 and 1519 Well Done and thank you for the papers the President 1245.&quot;

Prior to serving on the &quot;Macon&quot;, Wiley was one of only three survivors of the crash of the &quot;Akron&quot;. He was later promoted to commander and captained the battleship in the final two years of World War II. He retired from the Navy in 1947 as a rear admiral.

==Loss==

===Leading up to the crash===
On 20 April 1934, the &quot;Macon&quot; left Sunnyvale for a challenging cross-continent flight east to Opa-locka, Florida. As with the &quot;Akron&quot; in 1932, &quot;Macon&quot; had to fly at or above pressure height when crossing the mountains, especially over Dragoon Pass, Arizona, at an elevation of . Then, in the West Texas heat, the sun raised the helium temperature, and the expanding gas was automatically venting as the airship again reached pressure height. As the weather grew more turbulent, &quot;Macon&quot; had to rely on full engine power to maintain control. Following a severe gust near Van Horn, Texas, a diagonal girder in frame 17.5, near the fin junction, failed, followed soon by a second diagonal girder. Rapid damage control, led by Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Robert J. Davis, repaired the girders within a half hour.

&quot;Macon&quot; completed the rest of the journey safely, mooring at Opa-locka on 22 April. Over the course of nine days, more permanent repairs were made to the damaged girders; however, the addition of duralumin channels to reinforce frame 17.5 at its junction with the upper fin was not completed. Grounding the &quot;Macon&quot; until these reinforcements were made was considered unnecessary at that time.

===Crash===

On 12 February 1935, the repair process was still incomplete when, returning to Sunnyvale from fleet maneuvers, &quot;Macon&quot; ran into a storm off Point Sur, California. During the storm, the ship was caught in a wind shear which caused structural failure of the unstrengthened ring (17.5) to which the upper tailfin was attached. The fin failed to the side and was carried away. Pieces of structure punctured the rear gas cells and caused gas leakage. The commander, acting rapidly and on fragmentary information, ordered an immediate and massive discharge of ballast. Control was lost and, tail heavy and with engines running full speed ahead, &quot;Macon&quot; rose past the pressure height of , and kept rising until enough helium was vented to cancel the lift, reaching an altitude of . The last SOS call from Commander Wiley stated &quot;Will abandon ship as soon as we land on the water somewhere 20 miles off of Pt. Sur, probably 10 miles at sea.&quot; It took 20 minutes to descend and, settling gently into the sea, &quot;Macon&quot; sank off Monterey Bay.

Only two crew members were lost thanks to the warm conditions and the introduction of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the &quot;Akron&quot; tragedy. Radioman 1st Class Ernest Edwin Dailey jumped ship while still too high above the ocean surface to survive the fall and Mess Attendant 1st Class Florentino Edquiba drowned while swimming back into the wreckage to try to retrieve personal belongings. An officer was rescued when Commander Wiley swam to his aid, an action for which he was later decorated. Sixty-four survivors were picked up by the cruiser , the cruiser took 11 aboard and the cruiser saved six.

Eyewitness Dorsey A. Pulliam, serving aboard , wrote about the crash in a letter dated 13 February 1935:

In another letter, dated 16 February 1935, Pulliam wrote:

&quot;Macon&quot;, after 50 flights since she was commissioned, was stricken from the Navy list on 26 February 1935. Subsequent airships for Navy use were of a nonrigid design.

A depiction of the crash by artist Noel Sickles was the first illustration sent over the new AP wirephoto service, which Associated Press had launched at the beginning of 1935. Sickles said he had about two hours to draw the scene only knowing that the &quot;Macon&quot; had crashed at sea. He correctly guessed the Navy would send cruisers to aid the airship.
==Wreck site exploration==
The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) succeeded in locating and surveying the debris field of &quot;Macon&quot; in February 1991, and was able to recover some artifacts. The exploration included sonar, video, and still camera data, as well as some recovery of parts.

In May 2005, MBARI returned to the site as part of a year-long research project to identify archaeological resources in the bay. Side-scan sonar was used to survey the site.

===2006 expedition===
A more complete return, including exploration with remotely operated vehicles and involving researchers from MBARI, Stanford University, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, took place in September 2006. Video clips of the expedition were made available to the public through the OceansLive Web Portal, a service of NOAA.

The 2006 expedition was a success, and revealed a number of new surprises and changes since the last visit, approximately 15 years previous. High-definition video and more than 10,000 new images were captured, which were assembled into a navigation-grade photomosaic of the wreck.

===Protection===
The location of the wreck site remains secret and is within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. It is not accessible to divers due to depth ().

The U.S. National Park Service states:

The site was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 29 January 2010. The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service&#x27;s weekly list of 12 February 2010.

==In popular culture==
Footage of the &quot;Macon&quot; is used in the 1933 disaster film &quot;Deluge&quot;.

&quot;Macon&quot; is featured toward the end of the 1934 Warner Bros. film &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot; starring James Cagney, Pat O&#x27;Brien and Gloria Stuart. Cagney&#x27;s character is assigned to &quot;Macon&quot; after serving on the , which is featured heavily in the film.

The crash of &quot;Macon&quot; is depicted at the beginning of the 1937 film &quot;The Go Getter&quot;, featuring George Brent as her helmsman.

&quot;Macon&quot; is featured as a setting and key plot element in Max McCoy&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;Indiana Jones and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;; Indiana Jones travels aboard &quot;Macon&quot; while she makes a transatlantic flight to London.

<doc id="644354" wikidata="Q621547" url="?curid=644354" title="Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank">
<text>The was a medium tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union, and the Second World War. It was the most widely produced Japanese medium tank of World War II.

The 57 mm main gun, designed for infantry support, was a carry over from the Type 89 I-Go medium tank. The suspension was derived from the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, but used six road wheels instead of four. The 170 hp Mitsubishi air cooled diesel engine was a capable tank engine in 1938.

The Type 97&#x27;s low silhouette and semicircular radio antenna on the turret distinguished the tank from its contemporaries. After 1941, the tank was less effective than most Allied tank designs. In 1942, a new version of the Chi-Ha was produced with a larger three-man turret, and a high-velocity Type 1 47 mm tank gun. It was designated the Type 97-Kai (&quot;improved&quot;) or Type 97 &quot;Shinhōtō Chi-Ha&quot; (; &quot;New turret Chi-Ha&quot;).

==History and development==
With the Type 89 I-Go fast becoming obsolete in the late 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) began a program to develop a replacement tank for infantry support. Experience during the invasion of Manchuria determined that the Type 89 was too slow to keep up with motorized infantry. The new medium tank was intended to be a scaled-up four-man version of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, although with a two-man turret, thicker armor, and more power to maintain performance.

The Tokyo factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries completed a prototype designated &quot;Chi-Ha&quot;. The second prototype was completed in June 1937. Although the requirement was for a 47 mm gun, it retained the same short-barreled 57 mm gun as the Type 89B tank. However, at the time IJA was also interested in the lighter and less expensive Type 97 Chi-Ni prototype proposed by Osaka Army Arsenal, which had the same 57 mm main gun. With the out-break of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, the peacetime budgetary limitations were removed and the more capable and expensive Mitsubishi &quot;Chi-Ha&quot; model was accepted as the new Type 97 medium tank by the army.

==Japanese tank designations==
&quot;Chi&quot; (チ) came from &quot;Chū-sensha&quot; (チュウセンシャ, &quot;medium tank&quot;). &quot;Ha&quot; and &quot;Ni&quot;, in Japanese army nomenclature, refer to model number 3 and 4, respectively from old Japanese alphabet &quot;iroha&quot;. The Type was numbered 97 as an abbreviation of the imperial year 2597, corresponding to the year 1937 in the standard Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the name &quot;Type 97 &quot;Chi-Ha&quot;&quot; could be translated as &quot;1937&#x27;s medium tank model 3&quot;.

==Design==
The Type 97 hull was of riveted construction with the engine in the rear compartment. The tank had a four-man crew including a driver, bow machine-gunner, and two men in the turret. In the forward compartment, the driver sat on the right, and bow gunner on the left. The commander&#x27;s cupola was placed atop the turret. Internal communications were by 12 push buttons in the turret, connected to 12 lights and a buzzer near the driver.

The Type 97 was equipped with a Type 97 57 mm main gun, the same caliber as that used for the earlier Type 89 I-Go tank. The cannon was a short-barreled weapon with a relatively low muzzle velocity, but sufficient as the tank was intended primarily for infantry support. The main gun had no elevation gear, therefore, the gunner used his shoulder to elevate it.

The tank carried two 7.7 mm Type 97 machine guns, one on the front left of the hull and the other in a ball mount on the rear of the turret. The turret was capable of full 360-degree traverse, but the main gun was in a &quot;semi-flexible mount&quot; allowing a maximum 10-degree traverse independently of the turret.

The thickest armor used was 25 mm on the gun mantlet and 15–25 mm on the hull front. Power was provided by an air-cooled &quot;V-12 21.7 liter diesel Mitsubishi SA12200VD&quot; engine, which provided 170 hp (127 kW).

===Development of the improved &quot;Shinhōtō Chi-Ha&quot;===

The shortcomings of the Type 97, with its low-velocity 57 mm gun, became clear during the 1939 Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union. The 45 mm gun of the Soviet BT-5 and BT-7 tanks out-ranged the Japanese tank gun, resulting in heavy Japanese losses. This convinced the army of the need for a more powerful gun. Development of a new 47 mm weapon began in 1939 and was completed by the end of 1941. It was designed specifically to counter the Soviet tanks. A variant known as the Type 1 47 mm tank gun was produced. The gun&#x27;s longer barrel generated much higher muzzle velocity, resulting in armor penetration superior to that of the 57 mm gun. The 47 mm tank gun was mounted in a new, larger three-man turret creating a new version of the Type 97. It was designated the Type 97 &quot;Shinhōtō Chi-Ha&quot; (&quot;new turret&quot; Chi-Ha) or Type 97-&quot;Kai&quot; (&quot;improved&quot;). It replaced the original model in production in 1942. In addition &quot;about 300&quot; of the Type 97 tanks with the older model turret and 57 mm main gun were converted.

==Production==

The Type 97 medium tank was manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hitachi Industries, as well as some limited production in the Army&#x27;s &quot;Sagami Arsenal&quot;. The number of Type 97 medium tanks produced was slightly lower than of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks, but larger than any other tank fielded by Empire of Japan. The following number of units were produced for the years 1938 to 1943:

Type 97 Chi-Ha tank (57 mm gun):
*1938: 110
*1939: 202
*1940: 315
*1941: 507
*1942: 28
*Total: 1,162

Type 97-&quot;Kai&quot; Shinhōtō Chi-Ha tank (47 mm gun):
*1942: 503
*1943: 427
*Total: 930

Total production of the 57 mm &amp; 47 mm gun Type 97 medium tanks was 2,092. Although production peaked in 1943 it was the last year any Type 97 was produced, as factories switched to the new tank designs, most notably the Type 1 Chi-He medium tank.

==Further development==

The last design that was based directly on Type 97 lineage was the Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank with a 75 mm main gun of which 144 were built from 1944 to 1945. The Type 3 Chi-Nu retained the same chassis and suspension of the Type 97 based Type 1 Chi-He tank, but with a large new hexagonal gun turret and a commander&#x27;s cupola. The Type 4 Chi-To was a separate design, the last Japanese medium tank design to be completed during the war, considered equivalent to the German Panther tank, but with only two known to be completed by war&#x27;s end. By that time, the Japanese industry had been badly crippled by the American bombing campaign; as a result, few of these newer vehicles were ever built.

The IJA&#x27;s need to supplement their tank units with artillery led to a need for self-propelled guns (SPGs). Subsequently, the Type 97 chassis was utilized to manufacture nearly a hundred SPGs, consisting primarily of 75 mm guns. Since the IJA&#x27;s 1930s-era tanks didn&#x27;t have the firepower to penetrate the 1940s generation of Allied armor, a need for tank destroyers arose, and experiments ranging from 47 mm to 120 mm guns were conducted. However, due to naval priorities, raw materials for any IJA production were limited.

==Combat history==

The Type 97 was deployed in China in combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War with considerable success, as the ill-equipped National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China forces were limited to only three tank battalions consisting of British exports of the Vickers, German Panzer Is, and Italian CV33 tankettes.

Its first real test in combat against opposing armor came with the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in July 1939 against the Soviet Union. The IJA 1st Tank Corps consisting of the 3rd and 4th Tank Regiments (Yasuoka Detachment) had been assigned to the Nomonhan region, under the command of Lt. General Yasuoka Masaomi. Of the two regiments, only the 3rd Tank Regiment had been supplemented with four of the new Type 97 medium tanks. One was selected as the regimental commander&#x27;s tank.

During fierce fighting against the Red Army, the 3rd Tank Regiment was assaulting an objective ringed with strung coiled wire (piano wire). The regimental commander, Lt Col. Yoshimaru Kiyotake&#x27;s Type 97 tank became entangled up to its drive sprockets. Struggling to extract itself from the tank trap, Yoshimaru managed to move his tank rearward about 40 metres, when his machine stopped completely. Exposed to Soviet defensive positions, Yoshimaru&#x27;s Type 97 was subjected to the fire of a dozen Soviet BT-7 tanks and anti-tank guns. Soviet shells struck the tank&#x27;s drive gear, hull, and the engine area, causing the vehicle to erupt into flames. When the fire reached the tank ammunition, the tank exploded, tearing off the turret and throwing it several feet away from the hull. Only the tank&#x27;s gunner, who abandoned it, prior to the explosion, was uninjured. Yoshimaru&#x27;s body was recovered after the battle.

=== World War II ===

From 8 December 1941 and into early 1942, during the Battle of Malaya and the Battle of Singapore, Type 97 tanks were used by the 3rd Tank Group&#x27;s 1st, 6th, and 14th Tank Regiments under the command of Lieutenant-General Yamashita. The 1st Tank Regiment was attached to the IJA 5th Division, which was among the first Japanese military units to land at Songkhla in southern Thailand. One of its medium-tank companies was the 3rd Tank Company under First Lieutenant Yamane&#x27;s command (comprising ten Type 97 medium tanks and two Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks), forming part of the &quot;Saeki Detachment&quot;. The company was in the vanguard of the attack on northern British Malaya at the end of 1941. Later on, this same unit would be involved in forcing the defending British forces to abandon much of northern Malaya in the decisive Battle of Jitra at the start of 1942.

One key to the overall Japanese military successes in Malaya and Singapore was the unexpected appearance of their tanks in areas where the British did not believe tanks could be fielded. The thick and wet jungle terrain did not turn out to be a decisive obstacle for the generally light Japanese tanks.

Later on, the 2nd and 14th Tank Regiments participated in the Burma Campaign from 1942.
The Type 97 Shinhōtō Chi-Ha tanks were first used in combat in the battle of Corregidor in 1942. The updated 47 mm gun was easily capable of dealing with the armor of the American M3 Stuart light tanks, although in later combat service it was shown only to be effective against the sides and rear of the M4 Sherman medium tank.

During the Battle of Saipan on the night of 16–17 June, Type 97s of the 9th Tank Regiment, joined with Type 95s of the 136th Infantry Regiment in an all-out counterattack against the established beachhead by American Marines that had landed the day before. Led by the 44 tanks from the 9th, the Type 97s and Type 95s were knocked out by a Marine platoon of M4A2 tanks, several M3 75mm half-tracks, bazookas and 37mm antitank guns. It was the largest Japanese armor attack of the Pacific Theater of Operations. However, the Japanese Army seldom made major armored attacks during the Pacific War due to the limited maneuvering areas that prevailed on islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Terrain dictated the battle and IJA tanks were emplaced in hull defilade positions or even buried up to their turrets.

During the Battle of Guam, 29 Type 97 and Type 95 tanks of the IJA 9th Tank Regiment and nine Type 95s of the 24th Tank Company were lost to bazooka fire or M4 tanks. At the Battle of Okinawa, 13 Type 95s and 14 Type 97 Shinhōtō Chi-Ha tanks of the understrength IJA 27th Tank Regiment faced 800 American tanks of eight US Army and two USMC tank battalions. The Japanese tanks were defeated in their counter-attacks of 4–5 May 1945. Similar conditions were repeated in the Kwantung Army&#x27;s defense against the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, although there was little tank-versus-tank action. The Soviet Red Army captured 389 tanks.

=== After World War II ===
Some Japanese tanks remained in use, under new ownership, postwar by both sides during the Chinese Civil War. Japanese units in China that surrendered to the National Revolution Army at the end of war turned over their armor to the Republic of China. By the time the civil war restarted the Nationalist 3rd Tank regiment based in Beijing was exclusively equipped with Japanese tanks, including Type 97. Japanese armor was used because American aid to the Nationalists, including tanks and other vehicles had been severely curtailed.

Type 97 tanks captured during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria were turned over to the Chinese Communist army. After victory in the civil war, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) continued to use them in their inventory. The PLA&#x27;s force of 349 tanks in 1949 consisted mainly of Japanese Type 95 Ha-Go and Type 97 tanks. In Japan, a number of Type 97 tanks were demilitarized and used post-war for reconstruction.

==Survivors==
Restored examples of the Type 97 are on display at the Yūshūkan Museum at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, and the Wakajishi Shrine in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka in Japan. In Indonesia there is a Type-97 at the Brawijaya Museum in Malang. The wreck of a Type 97 was found buried in the sand on the beach at Miura, Kanagawa in 2005. Preserved examples are at the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Museum in Beijing, China and at the United States Army Ordnance Museum, Aberdeen, Maryland. Numerous ruined examples of Type 97 tanks can be found on Saipan and on the Kuril Islands.

<text>Admiral James Vashon (9 August 1742 – 20 October 1827) was a British officer of the Royal Navy. He saw service during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He was first captain of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, between 1801 and 1802. Previously, he had commanded &quot;Alert&quot; (1781), &quot;Europa&quot; (1786), and &quot;Formidable&quot;.

Washington&#x27;s Vashon Island was named after him by the explorer George Vancouver, who had been Vashon&#x27;s subordinate in &quot;Europa&quot;. Vashon rose to the rank of Admiral of the White. He is reported to have been stationed for many years in the West Indies.

==Family and early life==
James Vashon was born on 9 August 1742 in the village of Eye, near Leominster, Herefordshire. He was the son of the Vicar of Eye, the Reverend James Volant Vashon. The family was descended from Peter Vashon, a Huguenot apothecary c. 1636, who had immigrated from Paris. The family name is of French origins and became English. James Vashon entered the Royal Navy at age thirteen, in 1755, and first served aboard the 28-gun frigate under Captain Cornwall. As a midshipman he served on a number of vessels and saw combat service in the Mediterranean, the coast of North America, and in the Caribbean. In 1763 he passed his examination for lieutenant, but continued to serve as a midshipman until 1772 for lack of a lieutenant&#x27;s posting. Vashon was serving on when the Seven Years&#x27; War ended and went ashore on half-pay until 1774 when the Navy began re-arming for the approaching American War of Independence.

==American War of Independence==
He was appointed lieutenant on the frigate and was assigned to the West Indies. He was quickly promoted to first-lieutenant when Lieutenant Peter Rainier (for whom Mount Rainier was named) was promoted and transferred off the &quot;Maidstone&quot;. He achieved recognition with his action during the capture of the French ship &quot;Lion&quot;, when he was given command of the prize and over 200 prisoners, and successfully reached the British naval base at Antigua. As a reward, he was returned to England, promoted to commander, and given command of the 14-gun brig . During 1780–81, &quot;Alert&quot; served on convoy duty in the North Atlantic and in the Caribbean. During the second tour in the Caribbean for the &quot;Alert&quot;, Joseph Baker (after whom Mount Baker was named) served as cabin boy for Commander Vashon. Because of distinguished action as commander of the &quot;Alert&quot; during the battle of the Saintes, Vashon was promoted to captain and given command of the 64-gun ship-of-the-line . He then served as flag captain aboard , and then the frigate . With the end of the American wars, Vashon again went ashore on half pay in 1783. He and his wife Jane Bethell, who married in 1779, had a son in 1784, but Jane died suddenly in 1786. Vashon then married Sarah Rainier, the sister of his earlier shipmate Peter Rainier.

In late 1786 Vashon was recalled to service and took command of the 50-gun , where serving under him were Midshipmen James Baker and Peter Puget, and Lieutenant George Vancouver, who would become significant in future explorations of the area of Washington state. Vashon commanded a series of ships during the period from 1789 to 1804 including the 64-gun ships , , , and the 80-gun . It was during this period that George Vancouver commanded the Pacific Northwest expedition that bears his name and during which Vancouver named a number of prominent features of the Northwest after his colleagues and friends in the Royal Navy. On 28 May 1792 Vancouver named Vashon&#x27;s Island in honour of Captain Vashon. In 1842 Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition named Maury Island as a separate island and the usage began to change to Vashon Island.

In April 1804 Vashon was promoted to Rear-Admiral in command of the Leith Station, Scotland with his flag aboard . He instituted a formal convoy system out of Leith to protect this vital shipping route, and was so successful that he was promoted to Vice-Admiral in 1808. When Vashon decided to retire in late 1808, the merchants and leaders of Leith were so pleased that they gave him a public dinner, awarded him two commemorative plates, and honoured him as a Freeman of the City of Edinburgh.

==After the Navy==

Vashon retired to Ludlow where he lived at Number 54 Broad Street (which is marked with a Ludlow Civic Society blue plaque). He was promoted to Admiral in 1814, and died on 27 October 1827 at the age of 85. He was buried at St Laurence Church in Ludlow.

<doc id="644359" wikidata="Q1878399" url="?curid=644359" title="Flag of the Isle of Wight">
<text>The flag of the Isle of Wight was adopted and registered in January 2009. It shows a diamond shape (the island) hovering over ocean waves. The indentation of the top corner of the diamond represents the River Medina, which is the largest river on the island.

==History==

There is anecdotal evidence that the Isle of Wight county colours have been used as a flag. These consisting of two thinner green vertical stripes surrounding a central thick white stripe and these flags are still available from various sources. Other than this the only established flag of modern times prior to 2007 was the three anchor and castle design used by the council. Those who still fly the green and white colours now often refer to them as &#x27;The rebel green&#x27;.

In 2007 an &#x27;Isle of Wight Flag Committee&#x27; was founded to create a flag for the Isle of Wight. It ran a public competition, in association with the County Press newspaper, to design the flag, which received over 350 entries. Four designs were shortlisted and put to the public in a vote.

2008 competition finalists
The winning design was by John Graney and was registered by the Flag Institute on 9 January 2009. Although the island does not meet the Flag Institute&#x27;s preferred criterion of being a historic county, the flag has nevertheless been described as a &quot;county flag&quot; to reflect the island&#x27;s distinct identity.

In April 2009 the new flag was officially launched and replaced the older design flown from County Hall.

== Isle of Wight Council flag ==
Before this competition, the Council flag was the only popularly known flag for the island. It is taken from the Isle of Wight Arms granted in 1938 and features a representation of Carisbrooke Castle, which was the historic seat of the Governors. The blue surrounding field and three gold anchors represent the island&#x27;s status and maritime history.

The Council flag can only be used by the Council on its local government buildings. Therefore, until the new island flag was registered, the island&#x27;s team at events such as the International Island Games used only the Union Flag, or on occasion, St George&#x27;s Cross.

<doc id="644360" wikidata="Q3286748" url="?curid=644360" title="Home (Dixie Chicks album)">
<text>Home is the sixth studio album by American country music band Dixie Chicks, released on August 27, 2002, through Monument and Columbia Records. It is notable for its acoustic bluegrass sound, which stands in contrast with their previous two country pop albums.

The group was promoting the album when lead singer Natalie Maines made controversial comments about U.S. President George W. Bush criticizing his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Travelin&#x27; Soldier&quot;, was #1 on the Billboard Country Chart the week that Maines&#x27; comments hit the press. The following week, as many stations started a still-standing boycott of the Chicks&#x27; music, the song collapsed. None of their following singles gained traction with country radio. Despite these events, the album was certified 6× Multi-platinum status by the RIAA and has sold 5,979,000 copies in the United States up to November 2008. The album also featured a cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Landslide&quot;, which was their biggest pop crossover hit until 2007, when &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot; peaked at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album was also successful in Australia, in its 175th week in the country charts it was certified Triple Platinum for shipments of 210,000 copies.

The album was nominated at the 45th Grammy Awards for six awards, including their second attempt for Album of the Year. The group went home with four in 2003, including Best Country Album, Best Recording Package, Best Country Instrumental Performance for &quot;Lil&#x27; Jack Slade&quot;, and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;. Additionally, they were nominated for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical and Darrell Scott was nominated for Best Country Song for Long Time Gone. Two years later, they were nominated and won Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, this time for &quot;Top of the World&quot;. It debuted at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart and stayed there for four non-consecutive weeks. It also debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums, and stayed there for 12 non-consecutive weeks.

==Songs==

&quot;Landslide&quot; was originally recorded by Fleetwood Mac in 1975. &quot;Travelin&#x27; Soldier&quot; was originally recorded by its writer, Bruce Robison, in 1996, and then in rewritten form, in 1999; Ty England also recorded the song in 1999. &quot;Godspeed&quot; was originally recorded by Radney Foster in 1999; his wife suggested sending it to the Dixie Chicks because Natalie Maines had just had a baby. &quot;Long Time Gone&quot; and &quot;More Love&quot; were originally recorded by Darrell Scott in 2000. &quot;Truth No. 2&quot; and &quot;Top of the World&quot; were originally recorded by Patty Griffin for a 2000 album that went unreleased. &quot;I Believe in Love&quot; made its debut on the 2001 telethon &quot;&quot;.

== Singles ==
&quot;Long Time Gone&quot; was released on May 23, 2002 as the lead single from the record. It received positive reviews, with many critics noting the unique bluegrass and acoustic sound that was atypical of mainstream country music at the time. The song debuted at number 37 on the Hot Country Songs (then titled the &quot;Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks&quot;) chart on June 8, 2002 and later rose up to its peak position of number two on August 24. The song also ended up peaking at number seven on the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the group&#x27;s first top ten hit on the chart.

A cover of the Fleetwood Mac song, &quot;Landslide&quot; was released on August 26, 2002, as the second single from the album and the only one to be released to adult contemporary radio. The song was also the &quot;Hot Shot Debut&quot; of the week of September 7 (at country radio), debuting at number 32 and peaking at number two on the country charts on November 9. It also topped the Adult Contemporary chart, making it the group&#x27;s only number one hit on that chart. It went to become the second top ten hit from the album on the Hot 100, peaking at number seven. The song also peaked within the top ten in Canada and Australia.

&quot;Travelin&#x27; Soldier&quot; was released on December 9, 2002 as the third single from &quot;Home&quot;. It was performed a year before its release at the 2001 CMA Awards, footage of which was later used as the song&#x27;s music video. The song initially debuted on the country charts based solely on its live performance on February 16, 2002, at number 58, peaking at number 57. In its official release as a single, it re-entered the chart on December 14, 2002, at number 57. The song would go on to top the Hot Country Songs chart the week of March 22, 2003. 

&quot;Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)&quot; was released on May 22, 2003, as the fourth single from the album. It debuted on the country charts at number 59 on June 7, 2003. 

The album&#x27;s fifth and final single, &quot;Top of the World&quot; was released in September 2003. The song was originally written by Patty Griffin, who had tried to record the song, but a dispute with her label led her to get dropped and the album project shelved. 

==Reception==

===Critical===

The album received positive reviews. Metacritic gave the album an aggregated score of 75 (green label), indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Rhapsody&quot; ranked the album #1 on its list of &quot;Country&#x27;s Best Albums of the Decade&quot;. Another music blog, Country Universe, named it as the album of the decade. CMT&#x27;s Craig Shelburne included it on his &quot;A Dozen Favorite Country Albums of the Decade&quot; list. Engine 145 country music blog lists it No. 4 on the &quot;Top Country Albums of the Decade&quot; list. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put the album on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying: &quot;Even George W. Bush fans have to respect the Chicks&#x27; authentic bluegrass sound on &#x27;Long Time Gone&#x27; and &#x27;Landslide&#x27;. Okay, maybe they don&#x27;t. But they should.&quot; Allmusic said &quot;They&#x27;ve delivered not just their best album, but what&#x27;s arguably the best country album yet released in the 2000s. Needless to say, an instant classic.&quot;

<text>Justus Georg Westphal (18 March 1824 – 9 November 1859) was a German astronomer and mathematician.

Westphal is not to be confused with Johann Heinrich Westphal (1794 – 1831). Within the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) he also appears to be confused with a third Westphal, &quot;Alfred Friedrich Julius Westphal&quot; (&quot;Dr. A. Westphal&quot;), a geophysicist who lived from 1 August 1850 to 1924, and who first published in 1881. J. G. Westphal is only mentioned a few times in the ADS, between 1853 and 1859.

==Life==

Westphal was born on 18 March 1824 in Colborn near Lüchow. He received his PhD at the University of Göttingen in 1852, his thesis being published as &quot;Evolutio readicum aequationum algebraicarum e ternis terminis constantium in series infinitas&quot;.

He was a student of the famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who was also Director of Göttingen Observatory. During this period Westphal assisted at the observatory, where he held the title of &quot;Observator&quot;. In 1854, Westphal was appointed as a lecturer, but by the time of Gauss&#x27;s death in 1855, he had resigned from his astronomical duties and had been replaced by his colleague Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm Klinkerfues.

Westphal is chiefly known for discovering the periodic comet 20D/Westphal (a.k.a. 20D/1852 O1, 1852 IV, D/Westphal 1) on 24 July 1852. C. H. F. Peters independently discovered the same comet from Constantinople on 3 August. Although it returned in 1913 (20D/1913 S1, 1913 VI, 1913d), the comet failed to return in 1976 and is now considered lost. There is substantial evidence that the comet completely disintegrated before reaching perihelion during its 1913 apparition. Westphal did not discover any other comets or any asteroids, though he made many observations of asteroids and calculated the orbital elements of several.

Westphal, who had suffered from poor health for much of his life, died on 9 November 1859 in Lüneburg.

<doc id="644370" wikidata="Q5241972" url="?curid=644370" title="Davis Square">
<text>Davis Square is a major intersection in the northwestern section of Somerville, Massachusetts, United States, where several streets meet: Holland Street, Dover Street, Day Street, Elm Street, Highland Avenue, and College Avenue. The name is often used to refer to the West Somerville neighborhood surrounding the square as well.

Davis Square is located approximately four miles from downtown Boston, and two miles from mid-Cambridge. The square is served by the Davis Square Station, one of the stops on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)&#x27;s Red Line. Davis abuts the Powder House Square, Ball Square and Spring Hill neighborhoods, as well as Tufts University.

Davis Square is today a vibrant commercial, retail, nightlife and dining district. Businesses in Davis range from stores to restaurants to even a martial arts school. Davis fell into decline after World War II. After the Red Line was extended to Davis in 1984, however, the area began to experience a prolonged renaissance.

== History ==
Davis Square was officially designated as a square by the City of Somerville in 1883. It was named for Person Davis (1819-1894), a grain dealer who moved to the area in 1850 and built his estate near the intersection of Elm, Grove and Morrison Streets. Davis was both a Somerville selectman and alderman. During the 1860s and 1870s, roads were improved and rail connections strengthened, which allowed West Somerville to urbanize.

After the Civil War, between 1870 and 1910, people increasingly chose to live in West Somerville where subdivided land was plentiful for new homes, both modest and substantial, and the commute to Boston for employment was convenient thanks to rail connections. By 1857 horse car railway lines were extended along Massachusetts Avenue (then called North Avenue) from Harvard Square to Arlington, and in 1863 the Somerville Horse Railroad Company connected Union Square with West Somerville via extended tracks along Somerville Avenue. Passenger rail arrived in 1870, when the Lexington and Arlington branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad (later succeeded by the Boston and Maine Railroad) routed steam rail service through Davis Square. These public improvements stimulated substantial development in
the 1870s and 1880s as Davis Square quickly grew into an active commercial center. A boom in residential construction followed in the 1890s.

Brick paving was introduced in Davis Square in 1900 and the area continued to be a vibrant commercial and transportation center until post-World War II, with the exodus to the suburbs and the decline of urban centers throughout the nation. In 1914, the Somerville Theater opened, hosting silent films as well as burlesque shows. In 1927, the trains that had brought many people to Davis Square were re-routed. This also contributed to Davis Square&#x27;s decline in the middle part of the 20th century. Factories shut, businesses failed and residents began to move out to the suburbs. As a result, Davis Square lost many of its tenants and became home to &quot;burn-out storefronts&quot; and &quot;bars where motorcycle gangs hung out.&quot; According to a planning study completed in 1980, Davis Square suffered from &quot;a lack of competitiveness among merchants, traffic congestion, inadequate parking and an increasingly deteriorated physical environment.&quot;

The situation began to turn around in the late 1970s thanks largely to two entities: the Somerville Office of Planning and Community Development, and the Davis Square Task Force. Their efforts culminated in the Davis Square Action Plan, which was adopted in 1982.

In the meantime, local officials and citizen groups petitioned the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to create a Red Line subway stop in Somerville at Davis Square. The MBTA agreed and in 1977 business owners and other local residents and officials formed the Davis Square Task Force to act as a citizen advisory committee on community revitalization plans. By the early 1980s, grassroots ideas about new civic spaces, new job and housing opportunities and safe walking connections to surrounding neighborhoods became part of the discussion around the Davis Square train station.

With input from the Davis Square Task Force, the city made the Red Line station the cornerstone for downtown redevelopment. The goal was to strengthen commercial interests while preserving the residential character of the neighborhood. The 1982 Davis Square Action plan set forth the framework that led to the Somerville Community Path, the Harvard Vanguard office building, Buena Vista parking garage and Ciampa Manor senior housing building.

At the heart of Davis Square is a complex, busy six-point intersection, which was radically configured as part of the plan. Until the reconfiguration, two major, pedestrian-unfriendly streets bisected the square; crosswalks, sidewalks, curb extensions and refuge islands were added to enhance pedestrian capacity, circulation and safety. Additionally, several freight trains had run right through the square each day on the Boston and Maine Railroad, forcing traffic to back up for long periods of time.

The MBTA developed a central plaza linking the two station entrance buildings, built on the old railroad right-of-way. This plaza replaced a poorly defined open area containing at-grade parking spaces and debris. The plaza was designed to serve as the center of Davis Square, a gathering place and center for activities, including outdoor entertainment. The plaza and the station were both eligible for state percent-for-art moneys through the Arts on the Line program. One percent of the cost of constructing the new station entrances was used to commission several figurative sculptures including the Davis Square statues.

The city of Somerville and the Task Force initiated many other projects to accompany the Red Line extension and Davis Square improvements. Property redevelopment activities included a storefront and facade improvement grant program, financing for building renovations, and designation of a portion of Davis Square as an urban renewal district. Property acquisition, clearance, infrastructure upgrades, and development took place within the boundaries of this district.

The district was later developed as a 100,000 square foot office and retail complex, including public open space and a parking garage that serves patrons and employees of local businesses.

In 1997, Davis Square was listed by the &quot;Utne Reader&quot; as one of the fifteen &quot;hippest places to live&quot; in the United States. This reputation has continued; in 2016, real estate company Cushman &amp; Wakefield rated Davis Square as one of &quot;Top 100 Cool Streets&quot; in North America, giving it a score of &quot;Prime Hipness&quot;.

In 2005, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported the first million dollar condo sale in Davis Square, which marked a major shift for a neighborhood once known as affordable and working-class. It now contains some of the priciest homes in Somerville and is significantly more expensive than the average for eastern Massachusetts.

==Transportation==
Davis Square is served by the Red Line, extended from Harvard to Alewife via Porter and Davis in the 1980s, with the Davis station opening on December 8, 1984. Additionally, Davis Square connects to several MBTA bus lines leading to nearby towns.

As part of the Davis Square Plan, the old Boston and Maine Railroad right-of-way was converted into a mixed-use path known as the Somerville Community Path. Most of the remaining railroad right-of-way between Davis Square and the Red Line&#x27;s northern terminus at Alewife was redeveloped and landscaped as a linear park or bicycle/pedestrian pathway. A public park was constructed directly behind the Holland Street MBTA head house as part of a later project. The Alewife Linear Park connects Alewife MBTA station with the Minuteman Bikeway, a 10-mile bicycle path that leads to Bedford.

== Arts and culture ==

As Somerville continues to evolve, Davis Square was clearly the vanguard of revitalization and change. In the past three decades, Davis has become a vibrant regional center for retail, nightlife, dining and more. Davis Square is a prime business location with over 200 businesses including healthcare and high-tech corporations, national non-profits, and media offices. &quot;Boston Magazine&quot; notes half a dozen food and entertainment establishments dating from before the Red Line still extant in 2012, including the Somerville Theatre, The Rosebud, McKinnon&#x27;s Meat Market, and a candlepin bowling alley.

The Somerville Theatre shows movies, live performances, and hosted a satellite gallery of the Museum of Bad Art until a 2019 renovation.
The Public Radio International show, &quot;Living on Earth&quot; is recorded in its studios in Davis Square. For five years, the Jimmy Tingle Off-Broadway Theater boasted a variety of nationally and regionally known acts, both comedic and musical, including Jimmy Tingle himself, but closed at the end of October 2007.

Davis Square is host to several popular festivals and events throughout the year. The Somerville Arts Council&#x27;s popular ArtBeat festival takes place here every year on the third weekend of July, while the HONK! Festival of activist brass bands occurs here every October. During the summer months there are free public folk dances.

<text>Science of Logic (SL; , WdL), first published between 1812 and 1816, is the work in which Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel outlined his vision of logic. Hegel&#x27;s logic is a system of &quot;dialectics&quot;, i.e., a dialectical metaphysics: it is a development of the principle that thought and being constitute a single and active unity. &quot;Science of Logic&quot; also incorporates the traditional Aristotelian syllogism: it is conceived as a phase of the &quot;original unity of thought and being&quot; rather than as a detached, formal instrument of inference.

For Hegel, the most important achievement of German idealism, starting with Immanuel Kant and culminating in his own philosophy, was the argument that reality (&quot;being&quot;) is shaped by thought and is, in a strong sense, identical to thought. Thus ultimately the structures of thought and being, subject and object, are identical. Since for Hegel the underlying structure of all of reality is ultimately rational, logic is not merely about reasoning or argument but rather is also the rational, structural core of all of reality and every dimension of it. Thus Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Science of Logic&quot; includes among other things analyses of being, nothingness, becoming, existence, reality, essence, reflection, concept, and method.

Hegel considered it one of his major works and therefore kept it up to date through revision.

&quot;Science of Logic&quot; is sometimes referred to as the Greater Logic to distinguish it from the &quot;Lesser Logic&quot;, the moniker given to the condensed version Hegel presented as the &quot;Logic&quot; section of his &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences&quot;.

== Publication history ==

Hegel wrote &quot;Science of Logic&quot; after he had completed his &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; and while he was in Nuremberg working at a secondary school and courting his fiancée. It was published in two volumes. The first, ‘The Objective Logic’, has two parts (the Doctrines of Being and Essence) and each part was published in 1812 and 1813 respectively. The second volume, ‘The Subjective Logic’, was published in 1816 the same year he became a professor of philosophy at Heidelberg. &quot;Science of Logic&quot; is too advanced for undergraduate students so Hegel wrote an Encyclopaedic version of the logic which was published in 1817.

In 1826, the book went out of stock. Instead of reprinting, as requested, Hegel undertook some revisions. By 1831, Hegel completed a greatly revised and expanded version of the ‘Doctrine of Being’, but had no time to revise the rest of the book. The Preface to the second edition is dated 7 November 1831, just before his death on 14 November 1831. This edition appeared in 1832, and again in 1834–5 in the posthumous Works. Only the second edition of &quot;Science of Logic&quot; is translated into English.

== Introduction ==

===Hegel&#x27;s general concept of logic===
The cambridge companion to Hegel
3 studies on Hegel, Theodor Adorno
According to Hegel, logic is the form taken by the science of thinking in general. He thought that, as it had hitherto been practiced, this science demanded a total and radical reformulation &quot;from a higher standpoint.&quot; At the end of the preface he wrote that &quot;Logic is the thinking of God&quot;. His stated goal with &quot;The Science of Logic&quot; was to overcome what he perceived to be a common flaw running through all other former systems of logic, namely that they all presupposed a complete separation between the &quot;content&quot; of cognition (the world of objects, held to be entirely independent of thought for their existence), and the &quot;form&quot; of cognition (the thoughts about these objects, which by themselves are pliable, indeterminate and entirely dependent upon their conformity to the world of objects to be thought of as in any way true). This unbridgeable gap found within the science of reason was, in his view, a carryover from everyday, phenomenal, &quot;un&quot;philosophical consciousness.

The task of extinguishing this opposition within consciousness Hegel believed he had already accomplished in his book Phänomenologie des Geistes (1807) with the final attainment of Absolute Knowing: &quot;Absolute knowing is the &quot;truth&quot; of every mode of consciousness because ... it is only in absolute knowing that the separation of the &quot;object&quot; from the &quot;certainty of itself&quot; is completely eliminated: truth is now equated with certainty and certainty with truth.&quot; Once thus liberated from duality, the science of thinking no longer requires an object or a matter outside of itself to act as a touchstone for its truth, but rather takes the form of its own self-mediated exposition and development which eventually comprises within itself every possible mode of rational thinking. &quot;It can therefore be said,&quot; says Hegel, &quot;that this content is the exposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and a finite mind.&quot; The German word Hegel employed to denote this post-dualist form of consciousness was &quot;Begriff&quot; (traditionally translated either as Concept or Notion).

===General division of the &quot;Logic&quot;===
The self-exposition of the concept (also translated as notion), follows a series of necessary, self-determined stages in an inherently logical, dialectical progression. Its course is from the objective to the subjective &quot;sides&quot; (or &quot;judgements&quot; as Hegel calls them) of the concept. The objective side, its &quot;Being&quot;, is the concept as it is &quot;in itself&quot; [&quot;an sich&quot;], its reflection in nature being found in anything inorganic such as water or a rock. This is the subject of Book One: The Doctrine of Being. Book Three: The Doctrine of the concept outlines the subjective side of the concept &quot;as&quot; concept, or, the concept as it is &quot;for itself&quot; [&quot;für sich&quot;]; human beings, animals and plants being some of the shapes it takes in nature. The process of Being&#x27;s transition to the concept as fully aware of itself is outlined in Book Two: The Doctrine of Essence, which is included in the Objective division of the Logic. The &quot;Science of Logic&quot; is thus divided like this:
: Volume One: The Objective Logic
:: Book One: The Doctrine of Being (Sein)
:: Book Two: The Doctrine of Essence (Begriff)
: Volume Two: The Subjective Logic
:: Book Three: The Doctrine of the Concept (Wesen)

This division, look at, does not represent a strictly linear progression. At the end of the book Hegel wraps all of the preceding logical development into a single Absolute Idea. Hegel then links this final absolute idea with the simple concept of Being which he introduced at the start of the book. Hence the &quot;Science of Logic&quot; is actually a circle and there is no starting point or end, but rather a totality. This totality is itself, however, but a link in the chain of the three sciences of Logic, Nature and Spirit, as developed by Hegel in his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1817), that, when taken as a whole, comprise a &quot;circle of circles.&quot;

==Objective Logic: Doctrine of Being==

===Determinate Being (Quality)===

====Being====
A. Being-Sein

&quot;Being&quot;, specifically &quot;Pure&quot; Being (Sein), is the first step taken in the scientific development of &quot;Pure Knowing&quot;, which itself is the final state achieved in the historical self-manifestation of &quot;Geist&quot; (Spirit/Mind) as described in detail by Hegel in Phänomenologie des Geistes (1807). This Pure Knowing is simply &quot;Knowing as Such&quot;, and as such, has for its first thought product &quot;Being as Such&quot;, i.e., the purest abstraction from all that is (although, importantly, not &quot;distinct&quot; from, or &quot;alongside&quot;, all that is), having &quot;no diversity within itself nor with any reference outwards. ... It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness.&quot; The truth of Pure Being is this void of content and pure absence: Nothingness.

B. Nothing

&quot;Nothing&quot;, specifically &quot;Pure&quot; Nothing, &quot;is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, absence of all determination and content.&quot; However, Nothing has a meaning; it is present within intuiting, or is this empty intuiting itself. Nothing reveals itself to be immediate, a contentless positivity that is altogether the same as what Pure Being is.

C. Becoming

Pure Being and Pure Nothing are therefore the same, and yet absolutely distinct from each other. Their contradiction is the process of their immediate vanishing into one another. Being has passed over into Nothing, and Nothing into Being. This vanishing of prior positions is the intrinsic movement of the concept (&quot;der Begriff&quot;). Conceptual (&quot;begrifflich&quot;) movement with respect to Being and Nothing is called &quot;Becoming&quot;, and takes the form of reciprocal &quot;Coming-to-Be&quot; (&quot;Entstehen&quot;) and &quot;Ceasing-to-Be&quot; (&quot;Vergehen&quot;).

Hegel borrows Kant&#x27;s example of the &quot;hundred dollars&quot; [Critique of Pure Reason (1787)] to emphasize that the unity of Being and Nothing in Becoming only applies when they are taken in their absolute purity as abstractions. It is of course not a matter of indifference to one&#x27;s fortune if $100 &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot;, but this is only meaningful if it is presupposed that the one whose fortune it might or might not be already &quot;is&quot;, i.e., the $100&#x27;s being or not must be referenced to another&#x27;s. This, then, cannot be Pure Being, which by definition has no reference outwards. Heraclitus is cited as the first philosopher to think in terms of Becoming.

====Determinate Being====

=====A. Determinate Being as Such=====

The transition between Becoming and (a) &quot;Determinate Being as Such&quot; (&quot;Dasein&quot;) is accomplished by means of &quot;sublation&quot;. This term, the traditional English translation of the German word &quot;aufheben&quot;, means to preserve, to maintain, but also to cease, to put an end to. Hegel claims that it is &quot;one of the most important notions in philosophy.&quot; Being and Nothing were complete opposites whose inner unity needed to be expressed, or &quot;mediated&quot;, by a third term: Becoming. Once having been accomplished through mediation, their unity then becomes &quot;immediate&quot;. Their opposition, still extant in Becoming, has been &quot;put an end to.&quot; From the newly acquired standpoint of immediacy, Becoming becomes Determinate Being as Such, within which Being and Nothing are no longer discrete terms, but necessarily linked &quot;moments&quot; that it has &quot;preserved&quot; within itself. Sublation, then, is the ending of a logical process, yet at the same time it is its beginning again from a new point of view.

So, &quot;as&quot; moments of Determinate Being, Being and Nothing take on new characteristics as aspects of (b) &quot;Quality. Being becomes emphasized, and, as Quality, is &quot;Reality&quot;; Nothing, or &quot;Non-Being&quot;, is concealed in Being&#x27;s background serving only to delimit it as a specific Quality distinct from others, and, in so doing, is &quot;Negation in General&quot;, i.e., Quality in the form of a deficiency. Quality, then, comprises both what a Determinate Being &quot;is&quot; and &quot;is not&quot;, viz., that which makes it determinate in the first place. Within Quality, however, Reality and Negation are still distinct from one another, are still &quot;mediated&quot;, just like Being and Nothing were in Becoming. Taken in their &quot;unity&quot;, that is, in their immediacy as, again, sublated, they are now only moments of (c) &quot;Something.

Hegel contrasts his logically derived concept of Reality from the earlier metaphysical one present in the ontological &quot;proof&quot; of God&#x27;s existence, specifically Leibniz’s formulation of it. In this theory, God was held to be the sum-total of all realities. These realities are taken to be &quot;perfections,&quot; their totality therefore comprising the most perfect being imaginable: God. Speculative logic, however, shows that Reality is inextricably bound up with its own negation, and so any grand total of these realities would not result in something strictly positive, e.g., God, but would inevitably retain, to an equal degree, the negation of all these realities. The mere addition of realities to each other, then, would not in any way alter their principle, and so the sum of all realities would be no more or less than what each of them already was: a Reality and its Negation.

Something is the first instance in &quot;The Science of Logic&quot; of the &quot;negation of the negation&quot;. The first negation, Negation in General, is simply what a Determinate Being is &quot;not&quot;. Hegel calls this &quot;abstract negation&quot;. When this negation itself is negated, which is called &quot;absolute negation,&quot; what a Determinate Being &quot;is&quot;, is no longer dependent on what it is &quot;not&quot; for its own determination, but becomes an actual particular Something in its own right: a &quot;Being-Within-Self&quot;. Its negation, what it is not, is now &quot;cut off&quot; from it and becomes another Something, which, from the first Something&#x27;s point of view, is an &quot;Other&quot; in general. Finally, just as Becoming mediated between Being and Nothing, &quot;Alteration&quot; is now the mediator between Something and Other.

=====B. Finitude=====

(a) Something and Other are separate from each other, but each still contains within itself, as moments, their former unity in Determinate Being. These moments now re-emerge as &quot;Being-in-Itself&quot;, i.e., Something as Something only insofar as it is in &quot;opposition&quot; to the Other; and &quot;Being-for-Other&quot;, i.e., Something as Something only insofar as it is in &quot;relation&quot; to the Other. (Hegel&#x27;s view is in this way contrasted with Kant&#x27;s noumenon, the unknowable &quot;thing in itself&quot;: Being-in-itself taken in isolation from Being-for-Other is nothing but an empty abstraction and to ask &quot;what it is&quot; is to ask a question made impossible to answer.)

Something is now no longer only an isolated something, but is in both positive and negative relationship to the Other. This relationship, however, is then reflected back into the Something &quot;as&quot; isolated, i.e., &quot;in-itself&quot;, and bestows upon it further determinations. &quot;What&quot; a Something &quot;is&quot; in &quot;opposition&quot; to an Other is its (b) &quot;Determination; what it is in &quot;relation&quot; to an Other is its Constitution&quot;.

For example, a human being&#x27;s Determination is thinking reason, since that is what she unalterably is in &quot;opposition&quot; to her Other: nature. However, humans are entangled in nature in myriad other ways than just thinking rationally about it, and &quot;how&quot; humans react to this external influence &quot;also&quot; tells us about what they are. This is their Constitution, the part of their being that undergoes alteration in &quot;relation&quot; to its Others.

The point at which Something ceases to be itself and becomes an Other is that Something&#x27;s Limit. This Limit is also shared by its Other which is itself an other Something only insofar as it is on the far side of this Limit. It is therefore by their common Limits that Somethings and Others are mediated with one another and mutually define each other&#x27;s inner Qualities.

From the perspective of the Limit, a Something &quot;is&quot; only a particular Something insofar as it is &quot;not&quot; something else. This means that the Something&#x27;s self-determination (inherited from Determined Being as Such) is only relative, entirely dependent on what it isn&#x27;t to be what it is, and entirely dependent on Something posited as the contradiction of itself, of its own Limit. Something is thus only temporary, contains its own Ceasing-to-Be within itself and so is (c) &quot;Finite&quot;, i.e., doomed to eventually cease to be. For Finite things, &quot;the hour of their birth is the hour of their death.&quot; At this point the Limit ceases to play its mediating role between Something and Other, i.e., is &quot;negated&quot;, and is taken back into the self-identity―the Being-Within-Self―of the Something to become that Something’s &quot;Limitation&quot;, the point beyond which that Something will cease to be. The flip side of this, though, is that the Limit also takes its negative along with it back into the Something, this (the result of negating the Limit) being the Other yet now as posited &quot;in&quot; the Something as that Something’s very own Determination. What this means is that, in the face of its own Limitation, the very Quality that defined the Something in the first place ceases to be in any opposition to the Other, which is to say that it no longer strictly &quot;is&quot; this Quality but now &quot;Ought&quot; to be this Quality. Limitation and the Ought are the twin, self-contradictory moments of the Finite.

=====C. Infinity=====

The negation that Being-in-Itself experienced in the Limitation, the negation that made it Finite, is again negated resulting in the affirmative determination of (a) the &quot;Infinite in General&quot; which now reveals itself, not as something distinct from, but as the true nature of the Finite. &quot;At the name of the infinite, the heart and the mind light up, for in the infinite the spirit is not merely abstractly present to itself, but rises to its own self, to the light of thinking, of its universality, of its freedom.&quot;

This affirmation of the Infinite, however, carries with it a negative relation to an other, the Finite. Because of this, it falls back into the determination of the Something with a Limit peculiar to itself. This &quot;In&quot;-finite, then, is not the pure Infinite, but merely the non-Finite. Hegel calls this the &quot;Spurious Infinite&quot; and it is this that is spoken of whenever the Infinite is held to be over and above―separated from―the Finite. This separateness is in itself false since the Finite naturally engenders the Infinite through Limitation and the Ought, while the Infinite, thus produced, is bounded by its Other, the Finite, and is therefore itself Finite. Yet they are &quot;held&quot; to be separate by this stage of thought and so the two terms are eternally stuck in an empty oscillation back and forth from one another. This Hegel calls (b) the &quot;Infinite Progress&quot;.

This impasse can only be overcome, as usual, via sublation. From the standpoint of the Finite, the Infinite cannot break free into independence, but must always be bounded, and therefore finitized, by its Other, the Finite. For further logical development to be possible, this standpoint must shift to a new one where the Infinite is no longer simply a derivation of the Finite, but where the Finite, as well as the Infinite in General, are but moments of (c) the &quot;True Infinite&quot;. The True infinite bears the same relation of mediation to these moments as Becoming did to Being and Nothing and as Alteration did to Something and Other.

Hegel gives as a symbol of the Infinite Progress the straight line which stretches out to infinity in both directions. This Infinity is, at all times, the &quot;beyond&quot; of the Determinate Being of the line itself. True Infinity is properly represented by the &quot;&quot;circle&quot;, the line which has reached itself, which is closed and wholly present, without &quot;beginning&quot; and &quot;end&quot;.&quot;

This move is highly significative of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy because it means that, for him, &quot;[it] is not the finite which is the real but the infinite.&quot; The reality of the True Infinite is in fact &quot;more real&quot; than the Reality of Determinate Being. This higher, and yet more concrete, reality is the &quot;Ideal&quot; [&quot;das Ideell&quot;]: &quot;The idealism of philosophy consists in nothing else than in recognizing that the finite has no veritable being.&quot;

As having been sublated, the mediation which was performed by the True Infinite between the Finite and the Infinite now has resulted in their &quot;immediate&quot; unity. This unity is called &quot;Being-for-Self&quot;.

====Being-for-Self====

=====A. Being-for-Self as Such=====

At this point we have arrived back at simple Being from which all the previous developments had initially proceeded. This Being, though, is now in the standpoint of Infinity from which these developments can be seen as moments of itself and so it is (a) &quot;Being-for-Self as Such&quot;. Until this point Determinate Being was burdened with Finitude, depended on the Other for its own determination, and so was only &quot;relatively&quot; determined Being. From the Ideal standpoint of Infinity, Being-for-Self has become free from this burden and so is &quot;absolutely&quot; determined Being.

As a consequence of having overcome this relativity, however, both sides of the relationship between Something and Other are now also in equal relation to the Infinite Being that they have become Ideal moments of. So, although through their relationship Something and Other mutually determine &quot;each other&#x27;s&quot; inner Qualities, they do not have the same effect on the Infinite Being―be it God, spirit or ego (in the Fichtean sense)―to which they are now objects. This Being is not just another Finite Other, but is the One for which they are and of which they are a part. The Being-for-Other of Finitude has become the (b) &quot;Being-for-One&quot; of Infinity.

This Being-for-One recalls Leibniz’s monad because it involves a simple oneness that maintains itself throughout the various determinations that might take place within it. Hegel, however, is critical of Leibniz’s construction because, since these monads are indifferent to each other and, strictly speaking, are not Others to one another, they cannot determine each other and so no origin can be found for the harmony that is claimed to exist between them. Being-for-One, containing as it does the moments of determination within it, avoids this contradiction.

If we now take in isolation that to which all the preceding moments refer, i.e., that which we now have immediately before us, we end up with (c) the &quot;One&quot;.

=====B. The One and the Many=====

This (a) &quot;One in its Own Self, standing in negative relation to &quot;all&quot; its preceding moments, is entirely differentiated from each of them. It is neither a Determinate Being, nor a Something, nor a Constitution, etc. It is therefore indeterminate and unalterable. There is Nothing in it. Just as there is no criterion to distinguish Being and Nothing despite the fact that they are opposites, the One is also identical with &quot;its&quot; opposite, (b) the &quot;Void. The Void can be said to be the Quality of the One.

At this stage, the Logic has incorporated the ancient atomism of Leucippus and Democritus. Hegel actually held the ancient philosophical notion of atomism in higher esteem than the scientific one of modern physics because the former understood the void not just as the empty space between atoms, but as the atom’s own inherent principle of unrest and self-movement. &quot;Physics with its molecules and particles suffers from the atom ... just as much as does that theory of the State which starts from the particular will of individuals.&quot;

The original transition of Being and Nothing to Determinate Being is again echoed here in the sphere of Being-for-Self. The One, though, as negatively related to all aspects of Quality excepting its own Quality of being the Void, cannot take on a Qualitative determinateness like Determinate Being did. In its own self-differentiation, it can only relate to itself as another self identical to it, that is, as another One. Since no new Quality has been taken on, we cannot call this transition a Becoming, but rather a &quot;Repulsion&quot;, i.e., the positing of (c) &quot;Many&quot; Ones.

=====C. Repulsion and Attraction=====

Once these many Ones have been posited, the nature of their relationship begins to unfold. Because it is the nature of the One to be purely &quot;self&quot;-related, their relation to one another is in fact a &quot;non&quot;-relation, i.e., takes place externally in the Void. From the standpoint of the one One, then, &quot;there are no other Ones&quot;, that is, its relation to them is one of (a) &quot;Exclusion&quot;. Seen from &quot;within&quot; the One there is only &quot;one&quot; One, but at the same time the One only exists in the first place through its negative external relation to &quot;other&quot; Ones, i.e., for there to &quot;be&quot; the one One there &quot;must&quot; be Many Ones that mutually Exclude one another.

The idea that the One is entirely self-subsistent and can exist without the Many is, according to Hegel, &quot;the supreme, most stubborn error, which takes itself for the highest truth, manifesting in more concrete forms as abstract freedom, pure ego and, further, as Evil.&quot;

Now that Many Ones have been posited out of their Repulsion from the One, their original Oneness reasserts itself and their Repulsion passes over to (b) &quot;Attraction&quot;. Attraction presupposes Repulsion: for the Many to be Attracted by the One, they must have at first been Repulsed by it.

The One having been restored to unity by Attraction now contains Repulsion and Attraction within it as moments. It is the &quot;Ideal&quot; One of Infinite Being, which, for Hegel, actually makes it &quot;more&quot; &quot;real&quot; than the merely &quot;Real&quot; Many. From the standpoint of this Ideal One, both Repulsion and Attraction now presuppose each other, and, taken one step further, each presupposes &quot;itself&quot; as mediated by the other. The One is only a One with reference to another One―Repulsion; but this &quot;other&quot; One is in itself identical to, &quot;is&quot; in fact, the original One―Attraction: each is the moment of the other. This is the (c) &quot;Relation of Repulsion and Attraction&quot;, which at this point is only &quot;relative&quot;.

Although in Hegel&#x27;s estimation a triumph of the explanatory power of metaphysics over the physics based on sense perception as it was then practised, he believed that Kant’s Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft [Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science] (1786) retained many of the errors committed by the latter, foremost among these being that, since matter is given to the senses as already formed and constituted, it is taken to be such by the mind as well. The forces of Attraction and Repulsion that are supposed to act &quot;upon&quot; matter to set it in motion, then, are not seen also to be the very forces through which matter itself comes into being in the first place.

Repulsion and Attraction are relative to one another insofar as the One is taken either as the beginning or result of their mediation with one another. Imparted with continuous, Infinite motion, the One, Repulsion and Attraction become the sublated moments of &quot;Quantity&quot;.

===Magnitude (Quantity)===

====Quantity====
A. Pure Quantity

The previous determinations of Being-for-Self have now become the sublated moments of &quot;Pure Quantity&quot;. Pure Quantity is a One, but a One made up of the Many having been Attracted back into each other out of their initial Repulsion. It therefore contains Many identical Ones, but in their coalescence, they have lost their mutual Exclusion, giving us a simple, undifferentiated sameness. This sameness is &quot;Continuity&quot;, the moment of Attraction within Quantity. The other moment, that of Repulsion, is also retained in Quantity as &quot;Discreteness&quot;. Discreteness is the expansion of the self-sameness of the Ones into Continuity. What the unity of Continuity and Discreteness, i.e., Quantity, results in is a continual outpouring of something out of itself, a perennial self-production.

&quot;[S]pecific examples of pure quantity, if they are wanted, are space and time, also matter as such, light, and so forth, and the ego itself.&quot; Hegel here sharply criticizes Kant&#x27;s antinomy, put forth in his Critique of Pure Reason, between indivisibility and infinite divisibility in time, space and matter. By taking continuity and discreteness to be entirely antithetical to one another, instead of in their truth which is their dialectical unity, Kant becomes embroiled in self-contradiction.

B. Continuous and Discrete Magnitude

Although unified in Quantity, Continuity and Discreteness still retain their distinction from one another. They cannot be cut off from each other, but either one can be foregrounded leaving the other present only implicitly. Quantity is a &quot;Continuous Magnitude&quot; when seen as a coherent whole; as a collection of identical Ones, it is a &quot;Discrete Magnitude&quot;.

C. Limitation of Quantity

Quantity is the One, but containing within it the moments of the Many, Repulsion, Attraction, etc. At this point the negative, Excluding nature of the One is reasserted within Quantity. The Discrete Ones within Quantity now become Limited, isolated Somethings: &quot;Quanta&quot;.

====Quantum====

=====A. Number=====
The first determination of quantum is &quot;Number&quot;. Number is made up of a One or Many Ones—which, as quanta, are called &quot;Units&quot;—each of which is identical to the other. This identity in the Unit constitutes the Continuity of Number. However, a Number is also a specific Determinate Being that encloses an aggregate of Units while excluding from itself other such aggregates. This, the &quot;Amount&quot;, is the moment of Discreteness within Number. Both Qualitative and Quantitative Determinate Being have Limits that demarcate the boundary between their affirmative presence and their negation, but in the former the Limit determines its Being to be of a specific Quality unique to itself, whereas in the latter, made up as it is of homogeneous Units that remain identical to each other no matter which side of the Limit they fall upon, the Limit serves only to enclose a specific Amount of Units, e.g., a hundred, and to distinguish it from other such aggregates.

The species of calculation—counting, addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, powers/roots—are the different modes of bringing Numbers into relation with each other. Although the progress through these modes displays the same sort of dialectical evolution as does the Logic proper, they are nonetheless entirely external to it because there is no inner necessity in the various arrangements imposed on them by arithmetical procedure. With the expression 7 + 5 = 12, although 5 added to 7 necessarily equals 12, there is nothing internal to the 7 or the 5 themselves that indicates that they should be brought in any sort of relation with one another in the first place. For this reason, number cannot be relied upon to shed any light on strictly philosophical notions, despite the ancient attempt by Pythagoras to do so. It can however be used to &quot;symbolize&quot; certain philosophical ideas. As for math as a pedagogical tool, Hegel presciently had this to say: &quot;Calculation being so much an external and therefore mechanical process, it has been possible to construct machines which perform arithmetical operations with complete accuracy. A knowledge of just this one fact about the nature of calculation is sufficient for an appraisal of the idea of making calculation the principal means for educating the mind and stretching it on the rack in order to perfect it as a machine.&quot;

=====B. Extensive and Intensive Quantum=====
Taken in its immediacy, a Number is an &quot;Extensive Magnitude&quot;, that is, a collection of a certain Amount of self-same Units. These Units, say ten or twenty of them, are the sublated moments of the Extensive Magnitudes ten or twenty. However, the Number ten or twenty, though made up of Many, is also a self-determining One, independent of other Numbers for its determination. Taken in this way, ten or twenty (a) differentiates itself from Extensive Magnitude and becomes an &quot;Intensive Magnitude&quot;, which is expressed as the tenth or twentieth &quot;Degree&quot;. Just as the One was completely indifferent to the other Ones of the Many yet depended on them for its existence, each Degree is indifferent to every other Degree, yet they are externally related to one another in ascending or descending flow through a scale of Degrees.

Although thus differentiated from each other, Extensive and Intensive magnitude are essentially (b) the same. &quot;[T]hey are only distinguished by the one having amount within itself and the other having amount outside itself.&quot; It is at this point that the moment of the Something reasserts itself having remained implicit over the course of the development of Quantity. This Something, which reappears when the negation between Extensive and Intensive Magnitude is itself negated, is the re-emergence of Quality within the dialectic of Quantity.

: EXAMPLE: Weight exerts a certain pressure which is its Intensive Magnitude. This pressure, however, can be measured Extensively, in pounds, kilograms, etc. Heat or cold can be Qualitatively experienced as different Degrees of temperature, but can also be Extensively measured in a thermometer. High and low Intensities of notes are the results of a greater or smaller Amount of vibrations per unit of time. Finally, &quot;in the spiritual sphere, high intensity of character, of talent or genius, is bound up with a correspondingly far-reaching reality in the outer world, is of widespread influence, touching the real world at many points.&quot;

In the realm of Quantity, the relationship between Something and Other lacked any mutual Qualitative Determinateness. A One could only relate to another One identical to itself. Now, however, that Qualitative Determinateness has returned, the Quantum loses its simple self-relation and can relate to itself only through a Qualitative Other that is beyond itself. This Other is another Quantum, of a greater or lesser Amount, which, in turn, immediately points beyond itself to yet an Other Quantum &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. This is what constitutes the self-propelled (c) Alteration of Quantum.

=====C. Quantitative Infinity=====
Although a particular Quantum, of its own inner necessity, points beyond itself, this beyond is necessarily an Other Quantum. This fact, that Quantum eternally repulses itself, yet equally eternally remains Quantum, demonstrates the (a) Concept of Quantitative Infinity, which is the self-related, affirmative opposition between Finitude and Infinity that lies within it. This irresolvable self-contradiction within Quantum yields (b) the Quantitative Infinite Progress. This progress can take place in one of two directions, the greater or the smaller, giving us the so-called &quot;infinitely great&quot; or &quot;infinitely small.&quot; That these &quot;infinites&quot; are each the &quot;Spurious Quantitative Infinite&quot; is evident in the fact that &quot;great&quot; and &quot;small&quot; designate Quanta, whereas the Infinite by definition is &quot;not&quot; a Quantum.

Hegel here gives several examples of the appearance of the Spurious Quantitative Infinite in philosophy, namely in Kant&#x27;s notion of the sublime and his categorical imperative, as well as Fichte&#x27;s infinite ego as outlined in his &#x27;Theory of Science&quot; (1810). At bottom of all these ideas, says Hegel, is an absolute opposition that is held to exist between the ego and its other, this latter taking the form, respectively, of art, nature and the non-ego in general. The opposition is supposed to be overcome by the positing of an infinite relation between the two sides, the ego&#x27;s level of morality, for example, ever increasing in proportion to a decrease in the power of the senses over it. According with the nature of the Spurious Quantitative Infinite, however, it does not matter how great a level the ego raises itself to, the absolute opposition between it and its other is there and everywhere reasserted and the whole process can have no other outcome than a desperate and futile longing.

The Quantitative Infinite negates Quantum, and Quantum in turn negates Infinity. As occurs so often in &quot;The Science of Logic&quot;, a negation that is itself negated produces a new affirmative standpoint, the formerly negated terms having become the unified moments thereof. This standpoint is (c) the Infinity of Quantum from where it is seen that Infinity, initially the absolute Other of Quantum, essentially &quot;belongs&quot; to it and in fact &quot;determines&quot; it as a particular Quality alongside all the other Determinate Beings that had long since been sublated. This particular Quality which distinguishes Quantum from any other Qualitatively Determined Being is in fact the total lack of explicit self-determinateness that differentiated Quantity from Quality in the first place. The repulsion of Quantum from itself out into the beyond of Infinity, is actually a gesture &quot;back&quot; towards the world of Qualitative Determination, thus bridging once again the two worlds. This gesture is made explicit in the &quot;Quantitative Ratio&quot;, where two Quanta are brought into relationship with one another in such a way that neither one in itself is self-determined, but in relating to each other, they Qualitatively determine something beyond themselves, e.g., a line or a curve.

Hegel here engages in a lengthy survey of the history and development of the Differential and Integral Calculus, citing the works of Cavalieri, Descartes, Fermat, Barrow, Newton, Leibniz, Euler, Lagrange, Landen, and Carnot. His main point of concern is the compulsion of mathematicians to neglect the infinitesimal differences that result from calculus equations in order to arrive at a coherent result. The inexactitude of this method of procedure results, says Hegel, primarily from their failure to distinguish between Quantum as the &quot;Quantity&quot; that each individual term of a differential co-efficient represents, and the &quot;Qualitative&quot; nature of their relationship when in the form of a ratio. &quot;&quot;Dx&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;, are no longer quanta, nor are they supposed to signify quanta; it is solely in their relation to each other that they have any meaning, &quot;a meaning merely as moments&quot;.&quot;

====The Quantitative Relation====

A. The Direct Ratio

A ratio, such as &quot;x&quot;:&quot;y&quot;, is a &quot;Direct Ratio&quot; if both terms of the ratio are delimited by a single Quantum, a constant, &quot;k&quot; (what Hegel calls in the language of his day the &quot;exponent&quot; of the ratio),
:formula_1
In the Direct Ratio, the previously sublated Quantitative moments of Amount and Unit are retrieved and brought into immediate relation with each other. One side of the ratio, &quot;y&quot;, is a certain Amount relative to the other side, &quot;x&quot;, which serves as the Unit whereby this Amount is measured. If the constant is given, then the Quantum on any one side of the ratio could be any Number, and the Number on the other side will automatically be determined. Therefore, the first Number of the ratio completely loses its independent significance and only functions as a determinate Quantum in relation to an other. Formerly, any single Number could simultaneously denote either an Amount or a Unit; now, it must serve exclusively as the one &quot;or&quot; the other in relation to another Number serving as the opposite. The constant would seem to bring these moments back into unity with each other, but in actuality, it too can serve &quot;only&quot; as either Amount &quot;or&quot; Unit. If &quot;x&quot; is Unit and &quot;y&quot; Amount, then &quot;k&quot; is the Amount of such Units,
:formula_2
if &quot;x&quot; is Amount, then &quot;k&quot; is the Unit, the amount of which, &quot;y&quot;, determines it,
:formula_3
As in themselves &quot;incomplete&quot; in this way, these Quanta serve only as the Qualitative moments of one another.

B. Inverse Ratio

The &quot;Inverse Ratio&quot; is a ratio, &quot;x&quot;:&quot;y&quot;, in which the relation between both sides is expressed in a constant which is their &quot;product&quot;, i.e.,
:formula_4
or
:formula_5
Whereas formerly with the Direct Ratio, the quotient between the two terms was &quot;fixed&quot;, in the Inverse Ratio it becomes &quot;alterable&quot;. Because the Inverse Ratio confines within itself many Direct Ratios, the constant of the former displays itself not merely as a Quantitative, but also as a Qualitative Limit. It is therefore a Qualitative Quantum. The Spurious Infinity/True Infinity dialectic again makes an appearance here as either term of the ratio is only capable of infinitely approximating the ratio&#x27;s constant, the one increasing in proportion to a decrease in the other, but never actually reaching it (neither &quot;x&quot; nor &quot;y&quot; may equal zero). The constant is nonetheless &quot;present&quot; as a simple Quantum, and is not an eternal beyond, making its self-mediation through the two terms of the ratio an example of True Infinity.

C. The Ratio of Powers

The &quot;Ratio of Powers&quot; takes the following form:
:formula_6
It is in this form of the Ratio, says Hegel, that &quot;quantum has reached its concept and has completely realized it.&quot; In the Direct and Inverse Ratios, the relation between the constant and its variables was not continuous, the former only being a fixed proportionality between them, and the latter relating itself to them only negatively. With the Ratio of Powers, however, this relationship is not simply one of external limitation, but, as a Quantum brought into relationship with itself through the power, it is &quot;self-determining&quot; Limit. This self-determination constitutes the Quality of the Quantum, and finally demonstrates the full significance of the essential identity of Quality and Quantity. Originally, Quantity differentiated itself from Quality in that it was indifferent to what was external to it, that which it quantified. Now however, in the Ratio of Powers, what it relates itself to externally is determined by its &quot;own&quot; self, and that which relates externally to its own self has long since been defined as Quality. &quot;But quantity is not only &quot;a&quot; quality; it is the truth of quality itself.&quot; Quantum, having sublated the moment of Quantity that originally defined it and returned to Quality, is now what it is in its truth: &quot;Measure&quot;.

===Measure===

====Specific Quantity====

=====A. The Specific Quantum=====

&quot;Measure is the simple relation of the quantum to itself ... ; the quantum is thus qualitative.&quot; Previously, Quantum was held to be indifferent to the Quality of that which it quantified. Now, as Measure, Quality and Quantity though still distinct from one another are inseparable and in their unity comprise a specific Determinate Being: &quot;Everything that exists has a magnitude and this magnitude belongs to the nature of the something itself.&quot; The indifference of Quantum is retained in Measure insofar as the magnitude of things can increase or decrease without fundamentally altering their Quality, and yet their essential unity nevertheless manifests at the Limit where an alteration in Quantity &quot;will&quot; bring about a change in Quality.

: EXAMPLE: Aristotle gives the example of a head from which hairs are plucked one by one. Its Quality of being a head of hair remains if only a few hairs are gone, but at a certain point, it undergoes Qualitative Alteration and become a bald head. Although the Quantitative change is gradual, the Qualitative one, oftentimes, is &quot;unexpected&quot;. &quot;It is the cunning of the concept to seize on this aspect of a reality where its quality does not seem to come into play; and such is its cunning that the aggrandizement of a State or of a fortune, etc., which leads finally to disaster for the state or for the owner, even appears at first to be their good fortune.&quot;

=====B. Specifying Measure=====

Insofar as Quantity describes the upper and lower Limits between which a specific Quality can maintain itself, it serves as a (a) &quot;Rule. The Rule is an arbitrary external standard or Amount that measures something other than itself. Although it is often tempting to assume so, there is in actuality no object that can serve as a completely universal standard of measurement, i.e., be pure Quantity. Rather, what is involved in measurement is a ratio between two Qualities and their inherent Quantities, the one made to act as the (b) &quot;Specifying Measure of the other, this other, however, being itself just as capable of measuring that which it is being measured by.

: EXAMPLE: In the measure of temperature, we take the expansion and contraction of mercury relative to the heat it contains as a Quantitative Rule for the increase or decrease of temperature in general by dividing the range of its change in magnitude into a scale of arithmetical progression. Tempting though it is to believe, this is not the measure of temperature &quot;as such&quot;, but only the measure of how Quantitative change specifically affects the Quality of mercury. The water or air the mercury thermometer measures has a very different Qualitative relationship to changes in the Quantity of heat which do not necessarily bear any direct relation to mercury’s. Thus, what is actually going on when we take a temperature is a relationship of comparison between two Qualities and their respective natures when exposed to a Quantitative increase or decrease in heat, and &quot;not&quot; a universal determination by some disembodied, abstract &quot;thing&quot; that is temperature &quot;itself&quot;.

So long as we arbitrarily use the Quantitative properties of some Quality or other as a Rule to Measure the magnitude of other Qualities, we abstract from it its Qualitative nature. However, once we have established a Quantitative ratio between two or more Qualities, we can give this ratio an independent existence that Quantitatively unites things that are Qualitatively distinct. We can thus take the Qualities of both sides into account, the independent, or &quot;Realized&quot;, Measure serving as their (c) &quot;Relation&quot;. This Measure necessarily involves variable magnitudes since the Qualitatively distinct ways in which different things relate to Quantity can only be registered in their respective rates of increase or decrease relative to each other. Further, in order for each side of the ratio to fully reflect the distinctiveness of the Quality it represents, both sides must be Quantitatively self-related, i.e., take the form of powers as in the case of the Ratio of Powers explicated above.

: EXAMPLE: Velocity is the ratio of space’s relation to time:
:: formula_7
: It is only an intellectual abstraction, though, since it merely serves to measure space by the Rule of time or time by the Rule of space. It supplies no objective standard for the inherent Quantitative relation to each other that pertains to their specific Qualities. The formula for a falling body comes closer,
:: formula_8
: but here time is still serving as an arbitrary Rule, that is, it is assumed to vary in a simple arithmetical progression. It is the form of motion described by Kepler’s third law of planetary motion that comes closest for Hegel to being a Realized Measure of the relation between the inherent Qualities of space and time:
:: formula_9

=====C. Being-for-Self in Measure=====

Although now united by the Quantitative Ratio, the two or more Qualities thus brought into relation retain their mutual separation as distinct Qualities. For example, even though we can determine the Quantitative relationship between space and time in the example of a falling body, each of them can still be considered on its own, independent of the other. However, if we then take the constant produced by the ratio of the two sides as a self-subsistent Something in its own right, that is, a &quot;Being-for-Self&quot;, then the two formerly entirely distinct Qualities become its own sublated moments, their very natures now seen to have been in fact derived from this relation of Measure in the first place.

====Real Measure====

=====A. The Relation of Self-Subsistent Measures=====

&quot;Real Measure&quot; gives us a new standpoint external to the different Measures being brought into relation with each other, this relation now designating the independent existence of an actual physical Something. This Something gains its Qualitative determination from the Quantitative (a) combination between two Measures immanent in it, i.e., volume and weight. One designates an inner Quality, in this case weight; the other designates an external Quality, in this case volume, the amount of space it takes up. Their combination gives us the ratio of weight to volume which is its specific gravity. The constant that results from this ratio is the inner characteristic Real Measure of the thing in question, but, taking the form as it does of a mere number, a Quantum, this constant is likewise subject to alteration, i.e., addition, subtraction, etc. Unlike mere Quantum, however, the Real Measure of a thing is inwardly determined, and so preserves itself somewhat in alteration. If two material things are combined, the dual Measures of the one are added to those of the other. The degree to which they exhibit self-preservation is registered in the &quot;internal&quot; Measure—weight in this case—which ends up being equal, after combination, to the sum of the original two Measures; the degree to which they exhibit Qualitative alteration is registered in the &quot;external&quot; Measure—space in this case—which does &quot;not&quot; necessarily result in a sum equal to its parts, but often in the case of material substances exhibits a diminution in overall volume.

If we adopt the constant of one specific Real Measure as our Unit, the constants of other Real Measures can be brought into relation to it as Amounts in a (b) &quot;series of Measure relations. Since it is arbitrary which one Real Measure in such a series will serve as the Unit, there are as many incommensurable series of Measure relations as there are individual Real Measures. However, when two Real Measures, which are themselves ratios, are combined, the result is a new ratio of those ratios, itself designated by a constant in the form of a Quantum. If &quot;this&quot; constant is adopted as the Unit, instead of an individual Real Measure, then what were two incommensurable series are now made commensurable with each other in a common denominator. Since each Real Measure within a series forms such a constant with every other member in that series, &quot;any&quot; individual series in which a particular Real Measure serves as the Unit can be made commensurable with any &quot;other&quot; series with a &quot;different&quot; Real Measure as Unit. Since it is a thing’s Real Measure that determines its specific Quality, and since that Real Measure is in turn derived from the Quantitative relation it has with other Real Measures in the form of a series of constants, it would appear that, as in Determinate Being above, Quality is only relative and externally determined. However, as we have seen, a Real Measure also has an &quot;internal&quot; relation that gives it a self-subsistence that is indifferent to any external relation. Therefore, the series of Quantitative relationships between these Real Measures only determines the (c) &quot;Elective Affinity between their different Qualities, but not these Qualities themselves.

The Quantity/Quality dialectic manifests itself in the realm of Elective Affinity in that a Real Measure within in a series will not necessarily resonate Qualitatively with those in another series even if they bear a proportional Quantitative relationship. In fact, the specific Quality of a particular Real Measure is in part registered by the other Real Measures it has a special Affinity for, that is, &quot;how&quot; it responds to Quantitative Alteration. It is the Intensive side of Quantity (see above) such as it relates to specific Real Measures that determines its Qualitative behaviour when subject to changes in Extensive Quantity.

: EXAMPLE: Hegel makes it clear that the above analysis applies to the system of chemical affinities and that of musical harmony. In the case of the latter, for example, each individual note is a Real, self-subsistent Measure, consisting as it does of a specific internal ratio between, say, the length and thickness of a guitar string. An individual note, however, only achieves meaning in its relation to a system of other notes that are brought into Quantitative relation to each other through a specific note that serves as the Unit, or key. A note serving as the key in one system, is equally an individual member in other systems in which other notes play this role. Notes that harmonize when played together are demonstrating their Elective Affinity for one another, that is, the higher Qualitative unity that results from a combination in which each individual note nevertheless retains its self-subsistence.

=====B. Nodal Line of Measure-Relations=====

The relation of Elective Affinity is an external relation between two Real Measures that is determined by their Quantitative aspects. In and of themselves, each Real Measure retains its Qualitative indifference to all others, even those it has Affinity for. Real Measures, however, are also subject to &quot;internal&quot; alteration akin to what has already been discussed in &quot;Measure&quot; above, i.e., that its Quality can be maintained only within a certain Quantitative range beyond which it undergoes a sudden &quot;leap&quot; into another Quality. These different Qualities form &quot;Nodes&quot; on a line of gradual Quantitative increase or decrease.

: EXAMPLE: Natural numbers consist of a series of numbers that gradually increase by one in perpetual succession. However, some of these numbers relate in specific ways to others, being their multiple, power or root, etc., and thus constitute &quot;Nodes.&quot; Transition from the liquid to the frozen state in water does not occur gradually with a diminution of temperature, but all of a sudden at 0°C. Finally, the &quot;state has its own measure of magnitude and when this is exceeded this mere change in size renders it liable to instability and disruption under that same constitution which was its good fortune and its strength before its expansion.&quot; Thus, contrary to Aristotle’s doctrine that &quot;natura non facit saltum&quot;, according to Hegel nature &quot;does&quot; make leaps.

=====C. The Measureless=====
Measure, being the unity of Quality and Quantity, now transitions into its version of the Infinite, the &quot;Measureless&quot;, which accordingly is the unity of the Qualitative and Quantitative Infinites. In the Measureless, the Quantitative Infinite is manifested in the potential of the Nodal line to increase endlessly; the Qualitative Infinite is manifested as the eternal beyond of any particular Qualitative determination. Seeing as the successive determinations are self-generated by an internal Quantitative Alteration of Measure, they can now be seen, from the standpoint of the Measureless, to be different &quot;States&quot; of one and the same &quot;Substrate&quot;. The nature of the Substrate is not tied, like the Something was, to a merely external Qualitative appearance, but represents the underlying unity of a variety of internally determined appearances, which are its States.

====The Becoming of Essence====

A. Absolute Indifference

This Substrate, as what persists through the succession of States, is in a relation of &quot;Absolute Indifference&quot; to every particular determination—be it of quality, quantity or measure—that it contains. It is merely the abstract expression of the unity that underlies their totality.

B. Indifference as Inverse Ratio of its Factors

Taken in its immediacy, this Indifference is simply the result of all the different determinatenesses that emerge within it. It itself does not determine its own inner fluctuations, i.e., is not &quot;self&quot;-determining. However, in accordance with the measure relations developed so far, each of its moments are in reciprocal, quantitatively determined ratios with one another. Formerly, from the standpoint of Quality, a sufficient Quantitative increase or decrease would result in a sudden transition from one Quality to another. Now, with Absolute Indifference as our standpoint, every possible Qualitative determination is already implicitly related to every other by means of a Quantitative ratio. Every Quality is connected to, and in equilibrium with, its corresponding other. It is therefore no longer meaningful to say that something can have &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; of one Quality than another as if each Quality were absolutely distinct from each other. Whatever Quality there is &quot;more&quot; of in one thing than another can be equally said to be a &quot;less&quot; of whatever Quality exists in its stead in the other, i.e., there is an &quot;Inverse Ratio of their Factors&quot;. So, with a so-called &quot;Quantitative&quot; change, &quot;one factor becomes preponderant as the other diminishes with accelerated velocity and is overpowered by the first, which therefore constitutes itself the sole self-subsistent Quality.&quot; The two Qualities are no longer distinct, mutually exclusive determinations, but together comprise a single whole.

: EXAMPLE: Here, Hegel makes a powerful argument in favour of the explanatory powers of his speculative philosophy over those of empirical science, specifically with regards to the concepts of centripetal and centrifugal forces as they are supposed to relate the elliptical motion of celestial bodies. If, as is supposed by science, such an orbit is made up of an inverse relation of centripetal and centrifugal forces—the former predominating over the other as the body approaches perihelion, the reverse if approaching aphelion—then the sudden overtaking of the stronger force by the weaker that takes place on either end of the orbit can only be explained by some mysterious &quot;third&quot; force. Indeed, what is to stop the dominant force from completely overtaking the weaker, causing the body either to crash into whatever it is orbiting or to fly off at ever accelerating speeds into space? Only the inherent unity of the two Qualities, centripetal and centrifugal, arrived at by the ascension of thought to Absolute Indifference, can adequately explain the Notion of the elliptical orbit, says Hegel.

C. Transition into Essence

Strictly within the realm of Being, the underlying unity behind all its determinations necessarily stands externally, and in contradiction, to those determinations themselves. The transition to Essence occurs when these determinations reabsorb this unity back into themselves, i.e., they sublate it. The inherent contradiction between difference and unity is resolved when the latter is posited as the &quot;negative&quot; of the former. So, from henceforth it cannot be said that they simply emerge &quot;within&quot; the Substrate of Indifference, but that this &quot;substrate&quot; itself &quot;is&quot; their very own living self-relation. In other words, the differences between all the determinations of Being, namely the Quantitative difference and the inverse ratio of factors, are no longer self-subsistent, but in fact are mere moments in the expression of the implicit unity that rules them and, themselves, &quot;&quot;are&quot; only through their repulsion from themselves.&quot; Being has finally determined itself to no longer be simply affirmative Being, i.e., that which characterized Being as Being in the first place, but as a &quot;relation&quot; with itself, as &quot;Being-With-Self&quot;, or &quot;Essence&quot;.

==Objective Logic: Doctrine of Essence==

===Reflection-Within-Self===

====Illusory Being====

=====A. The Essential and the Unessential=====

The immediate characteristic displayed by Essence, once it finally emerges from Being, is simply that it is &quot;not&quot; Being. This apparently puts us back into the sphere of Determinate Being (see above), where each side of a relation mutually determined the Other side as being &quot;not&quot; what &quot;it&quot; is. In this immediate, merely relative relation, Essence and Being thus become the &quot;Essential&quot; and the &quot;Unessential&quot;, respectively. There is nothing arising within this relation, however, to tell us &quot;what&quot; it is about something that is Essential and what Unessential. Those that apply this mode of thinking to something are making an arbitrary distinction, the opposite of which could always be claimed with equal justification. What saves Essence from falling back into the relativism of Determinate Being is the very radical and absolute distinction from Being that defines it as Essence in the first place. Being cannot therefore simply preserve itself as an Other relative to Essence, but, having been sublated by Essence, it has for that very reason itself become &quot;nothingness&quot;, a &quot;non-essence&quot;, &quot;Illusory Being&quot;.

=====B. Illusory Being=====

So in its relation to Essence, Being has lost its being, has become Illusory. All the determinations of Being covered in the first third of the Science of Logic are no longer self-subsistent, but only &quot;are&quot; at all as negations of Essence. This total dependence on Essence means that there is nothing any longer in Being itself upon which any of its own determinations can be based, i.e., there is no longer any &quot;mediation&quot; within Being. This role is entirely taken up by Essence which is &quot;pure&quot; mediation relative to Illusory Being&#x27;s &quot;pure&quot; immediacy. Hegel claims this is the mode of thought that corresponds to ancient skepticism as well as the &quot;modern&quot; idealism of Leibniz, Kant, and Fichte. Illusory Being, though not Essence itself, nevertheless &quot;belongs&quot; entirely to Essence. It is that through which Essence generates itself as what it is, namely, the &quot;purely negative&quot; as regards Being. The constant appearance and disappearance of the empty manifestations of Illusory Being can now be seen as Essence&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; self-generating movement, its own &quot;Reflection&quot;.

=====C. Reflection=====

Reflection in the sphere of Essence corresponds to Becoming in the sphere of Being. However, in Being, this movement was between a positive—pure Being—and a negative—pure Nothingness. Here however, the two terms are Illusory Being and Essence. Illusory Being, as has already been established, is a nullity, nothingness. Essence, by definition, is non-being, &quot;absolute negativity&quot;. So Reflection, the movement between them, is the movement of &quot;nothing to nothing&quot; and so back to itself. Both these terms, in being &quot;absolutely negative&quot;, are identical to one another: Essence &quot;is&quot; Illusory Being and Illusory Being &quot;is&quot; Essence. They are, however, also &quot;relatively negative&quot;, in that the one is, by definition, &quot;not&quot; what the other is. This contradiction manifests in Essence in that it &quot;presupposes&quot; or &quot;posits&quot;, &quot;on its own&quot;, that which it immediately differentiates itself from: Illusory Being. This absolute recoil upon itself is Essence as a) &quot;Positing Reflection&quot;.

The next determination of Reflection, b) &quot;External Reflection&quot;, shifts the emphasis from the absolute negativity, or nothingness, in which the posited Illusory Being and its positing Essence find their &quot;identity&quot;, to the relative negativity upon which their &quot;opposition&quot; is based. Although it &quot;knows&quot; that the Illusory Being it finds immediately before it has been posited by none other than &quot;itself&quot;, External Reflection nevertheless regards this Being as something &quot;external&quot; to it from which it returns to itself. What concerns it, therefore, is no longer the act of positing itself, but the specific &quot;determinateness&quot; of that which is posited, since it is this and nothing else that establishes its externality in the first place.

Hegel offers for comparison with his notion of External Reflection the &quot;reflective judgement&quot; of Kant, which, in the Critique of Judgement, is described as the faculty of the mind that determines the &quot;universals&quot; that lie behind immediately given &quot;particulars&quot;. This action is similar to that of External Reflection with the crucial difference that, for Hegel, the universal does not simply lie &quot;behind&quot; the particular, but &quot;generates&quot; the particular from itself and so is the particular&#x27;s own true &quot;Essence&quot;. The immediate particular upon which Kant&#x27;s judgement works is, in actuality, simply a &quot;nothingness&quot; posited by Reflection itself solely in order to generate its equally null universal, Essence.

With Positing Reflection, the Illusory Being that was posited was only a means for Essence&#x27;s mediation with itself. Now, with c) &quot;Determining Reflection&quot;, not only is the moment of Illusory Being foregrounded again, but the specific determinations of this Being come into play as well. The absolute nothingness of Essence forms the background to any and all of the determinations it chooses to Reflect itself off of. These Determinations of Reflection—formerly known as Determinate Beings when they were in the realm of Quality (see above)—therefore share in the nullity that undergirds them. This nullity actually serves to fix them eternally in their specific determination and preserve them from Alteration, because they no longer relate to each other externally as Others to one another, but &quot;internally&quot; as equals in Essence&#x27;s nothingness. All the possible determinations of Being are thus preserved negatively in Essence as free &quot;Essentialities&quot; &quot;floating in the void without attracting or repelling one another.&quot;

====The Essentialities====

=====A. Identity=====

In the sphere of Being, above, Qualities were determined only &quot;relatively&quot;. What something &quot;was&quot;, was determined entirely by that which differentiated it from what it &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot;, i.e., it was &quot;negatively&quot; determined by its Other. Here in Essence however, the negativity necessary to establish determination is no longer directed outward, towards an Other, but &quot;inward&quot;. This is because Essence is in itself &quot;absolute negativity&quot;, nothingness, and it follows that any determination made therein will share in this negativity and itself be essentially nothing. Therefore, an &quot;Essentiality&quot;, as opposed to a Quality, is essentially &quot;the same&quot; as its other—they are both essentially nothing. As self-determining, whatever determination Essence takes on is freely self-generated, it &quot;is what it is,&quot; and so is simple &quot;Identity-with-self&quot;. This absolute Identity rests on the &quot;absolute&quot; negativity that unites Essence with its Essentialities. However, if we recall from &quot;Reflection&quot; above, Essence is also negative &quot;relative&quot; to its Essentialities. The Essentialities are &quot;determined&quot; Essence and, as we know, determination by definition involves negation. Therefore, while the Essentialities are absolutely Identical in their shared nothingness, their &quot;absolute&quot; negativity, they are equally absolutely &quot;Different&quot; in their determinations, their &quot;relative&quot; negativity.

Here Hegel embarks on a critique on one of the most basic assumptions of classical logic, the Law of Identity, usually expressed as A=A. Although superficially the immediate truth of this proposition cannot be denied, further reflection reveals that nothing absolute can be derived from it. For it can only hold true provisionally insofar as A is &quot;different&quot; from not-A. The Law of Identity, the purpose of which is to draw an absolute distinction between identity and difference, therefore contains difference as a necessary moment implicitly within it. The paucity of the absolute truth it is meant to represent becomes very clear when applied empirically. &quot;If ... to the question &#x27;what is a plant?&#x27; the answer is given &#x27;A plant is—a plant&#x27;, the truth of such a statement is at once admitted by the entire company on whom it is tested, and at the same time it is equally unanimously declared that the statement says &quot;nothing&quot;.&quot;

=====B. Difference=====

The Difference of Reflection must be distinguished from the Otherness of Determinate Being. The latter is a relative relation between two Determinate Beings whereby they distinguish themselves one from another and in turn determine themselves as specific Beings based on this distinction. In the sphere of Reflection, however, any determination &quot;posited&quot; by Essence is, &quot;as&quot; a determination, necessarily Different from the absolute negativity that is its Essence. The Difference of Reflection, therefore, is different in relation to its &quot;own self&quot;, and so it is not relative but a) &quot;Absolute Difference&quot;.

Absolute Difference contains both Difference &quot;and&quot; Identity within it as &quot;moments&quot; just as, conversely, Identity contains itself and Difference as &quot;its&quot; moments. The relation between Identity and Difference takes the form of one term reflecting off the other back into itself: Difference off of Identity back into itself or Identity off of Difference back into itself. &quot;This is to be considered as the essential nature of reflection and as the &quot;specific, original ground of all activity and self-movement&quot;.&quot; Because each of these two moments are self-related in this way, they do &quot;not&quot; mutually determine one another. Instead, they are indifferent to one another. Therefore, Difference is b) &quot;Diversity&quot;.

Yet another duality emerges at this point. &quot;As moments&quot;, Identity and Difference require each other and are bound up with one another: one term could not exist without the other. But at the same time, they absolutely &quot;negate&quot; one another and only &quot;are&quot; at all by virtue of their mutual negation of each other. So if we are an external party concerned with a specific determination of Identity, the moment of Difference, though intrinsic to the fact of this Identity, is very far from our minds. That it is Different from other things does not concern us or it at the moment: it is &quot;implicit&quot;. The category of Identity itself, however, is &quot;not&quot; determined by whatever it is that it is applied to, but by its reflection off of Difference back into itself. So if, from our external standpoint, that which comprises the &quot;Identity&quot; of something cannot be established without a Comparison of &quot;Likeness&quot; with something else. What specifically is &quot;Different&quot; about something can similarly only be determined by a Comparison of &quot;Unlikeness&quot; between it and something else. Like and Unlike, being external to the things they refer to, can each be equally applied to one and the same Determination. Things are Like each other insofar as they are not Unlike each other and vice versa: the two terms are mutually exclusive insofar as they refer to the same thing, but &quot;in themselves&quot;, apart from the things they refer to, there is no difference between them. Since any aspect may be externally selected to demonstrate the Likeness and Unlikeness of any two things, these terms really only refer, not intrinsically to their objects, but to &quot;themselves&quot; only and, as likewise self-referred, are indistinguishable from each other independent of their objects. Likeness and Unlikeness are both in fact only &quot;Likeness&quot;. The &quot;internal&quot; union that existed between Identity and Difference which is merely implicit to the outside observer, therefore emerges again in external reflection between Likeness and Unlikeness, and thus overcomes the &quot;external&quot; Diversity that held Identity and Difference indifferently apart from each other. This reconstituted unity that thus comes out of Diversity is c) &quot;Opposition&quot;.

The hidden, internal unity that bound the two moments of Identity and Difference together despite their apparent mutual indifference becomes explicit once they are mediated from the outside by Likeness and Unlikeness. They are no longer indifferent to one another but relate to each other intrinsically as Opposites. A given determination, as seen from its &quot;Positive&quot; aspect, is Likeness reflected back onto itself off of Unlikeness. Seen from its &quot;Negative&quot; aspect, it is Unlikeness reflected back onto itself off of Likeness. These two aspects, however, are the constitutive moments of one and the same overall determination. Although &quot;as a whole&quot;, the Positive and Negative comprise a unity, the Positive &quot;on its own&quot; is also a self-subsistent being, as is the Negative &quot;on its own&quot;. Because of this, the Negative can equally well be regarded as positive and vice versa. They are not Positive and Negative merely in comparison with one another, but each contains within itself the other as an essential element of its own determination.

: EXAMPLE: &quot;An hour&#x27;s journey to the east and the same distance traveled back to the west, cancels the first journey. ... At the same time, the hour&#x27;s journey to the east is not in itself the positive direction, nor is the journey west the negative direction; ... it is a third point of view outside them that makes one positive and the other negative. ... [T]he distance covered is only one distance, not two, one going east and the other going west.&quot; But at the same time, &quot;the distance traveled east and west is the sum of a twofold effort or the sum of two periods of time.&quot;

=====C. Contradiction=====

Both the Positive and the Negative are self-subsistent determinations: each side can stand on its own without explicit reference to the other. At the same time, however, they completely exclude one another and in fact rely on this exclusion for their self-subsistence. In that sense, the Positive itself is constituted by the very Negative that it excludes; it is &quot;based&quot; on this exclusion and thus contains what it excludes within itself. Ditto the Negative. This inclusion of what is excluded is what constitutes the Positive and the Negative as what they are. This is &quot;Contradiction&quot;. (In the Negative, this self- contradiction is explicit, but it is no less the nature of the Positive.)

So, similar to Becoming above, the Positive and the Negative immediately transition the one into the other: the Positive &quot;includes&quot; the Negative which immediately &quot;excludes&quot; the Positive; the resulting Negative however also &quot;includes&quot; the Positive which in turn &quot;excludes&quot; the Negative and so on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. This mutual inclusion and exclusion cancels out the both of them. This results in nullity. Out of this nullity, the unity of the two sides is restored in the following way. As stated above, both the Positive and the Negative are each self-subsistent on their own, but it is a self-subsistence that is immediately obliterated by the other&#x27;s. Now, however, arising out of their mutual destruction comes a self-subsistence that is common to the both of them. Instead of merely excluding each other, each side &quot;sublates&quot; the other, meaning that whatever is posited as Positive is &quot;at the same time&quot; equally the Negative of its Negative, and whatever is Negative is &quot;at the same time&quot; equally a Positive. The two sides posit and negate each other simultaneously, and in doing so they no longer destroy each other, but &quot;preserve&quot; one another. Therefore, the Positive and Negative are in fact the &quot;same&quot; and this, their sameness—which nevertheless includes their Contradiction—is their Essence as &quot;Ground&quot;.

:EXAMPLE: Light is usually reckoned as purely Positive and dark, purely Negative: the absence of light. However, it is not inherent to these terms that they should be so. Darkness can be taken to be a Positive in its own right &quot;as the non-self-differentiating womb of generation&quot; and vice versa. Furthermore, although they are usually defined as being mutually exclusive, the one being the absence of the other, there is a quantitative spectrum of grey and a qualitative spectrum of colour which exist between the one extreme and the other. The Ground would be a concept of &quot;light&quot; which includes all of the above.

===Ground===

Simply put ground is the &quot;essence of essence,&quot; which for Hegel arguably means the lowest, broadest rung in his ontology because ground appears to fundamentally support his system. Hegel says, for example, that ground is &quot;that from which phenomena is understood.&quot; Within ground Hegel brings together such basic constituents of reality as form, matter, essence, content, relation, and condition. The chapter on ground concludes by describing how these elements, properly conditioned, ultimately will bring a fact into existence (a segue to the subsequent chapter on existence).

Hegel considers form to be the focal point of &quot;absolute ground,&quot; saying that form is the &quot;completed whole of reflection.&quot; Broken into components, form taken together with essence gives us &quot;a substrate for the ground relation&quot; (Hegel seems to mean relation in a quasi-universal sense). When we combine form with matter the result is &quot;determinate matter.&quot; Hegel thinks that matter itself &quot;cannot be seen&quot;: only a determination of matter resulting from a specific form can be seen. Thus the only way to see matter is by combining matter with form. Finally, content is the unity of form and determinate matter. Content is what we perceive.

&quot;Determinate ground&quot; consists of &quot;formal ground,&quot; &quot;real ground,&quot; and &quot;complete ground.&quot; Remember with Hegel that when we classify something as determinate we are not referring to absolute abstractions (as in absolute ground, above) but now (with determinate ground) have some values attached to some variables—or to put it in Hegel&#x27;s terminology, ground is now &quot;posited and derived&quot; with &quot;determinate content.&quot;

In formal ground, Hegel seems to be referring to those causal explanations of some phenomena that make it what it is. In a (uncharacteristically) readable three paragraph remark, Hegel criticizes the misuse of formal grounds, claiming that the sciences are basically built upon empty tautologies. Centrifugal force, Hegel states as one of several examples drawn from the physical sciences,
may be given as prime grounds (i.e. &quot;explanation of&quot;) some phenomena, but we may later find upon critical examination that this phenomenon supposedly explained by centrifugal force is actually used to infer centrifugal force in the first place. Hegel characterizes this sort of reasoning as a &quot;witch&#x27;s circle&quot; in which &quot;phenomena and phantoms run riot.&quot;

Real ground is external and made up of two substrates, both directly applicable to content (which evidently is what we seem to perceive). The first is the relation between the ground and the grounded and the second substrate handles the diversity of content. As an example Hegel says that an official may hold an office for a variety of reasons—suitable connections, made an appearance on such and such occasion, and so forth. These various factors are the grounds for his holding office. It is real ground that serves to firstly make the connection between holding office and these reasons, and secondly to bind the various reasons, i.e. diverse content, together. Hegel points out that &quot;the door is wide open&quot; to infinite determinations that are external to the thing itself (recall that real ground is external). Potentially any set of reasons could be given for an official to be holding office.

In complete ground, Hegel brings together formal and real ground, now saying that formal ground presupposes real ground and vice versa. Complete ground Hegel says is the &quot;total ground-relation.&quot;

==Subjective Logic or the Doctrine of the Concept==
In the third major piece within the &quot;Science of Logic&quot;, Hegel introduces his idea of pure concepts within which he extends Kant&#x27;s basic schemes of judgement and syllogism classification. Hegel shows that the true idea can only be based upon valid reasoning and objectivity. Hegel affirms a conceptual realism in which the pure concepts ground any form of actual beings.

<text>Alejandro Lerroux García (4 March 1864, in La Rambla, Córdoba – 25 June 1949, in Madrid) was a Spanish politician who was the leader of the Radical Republican Party. He served as Prime Minister three times from 1933 to 1935 and held several cabinet posts as well. A highly charismatic politician, he was distinguished by his demagogical and populist political style.

Founder and leader of the Radical Republican Party (PRR), he was a controversial politician from the beginning, being especially known for his demagogic rhetoric. With a workerist, anticlerical discourse and diametrically opposed to the incipient Catalan nationalism, during his first political stage he became a prominent political leader in Barcelona. Later he would adopt more moderate positions, having a prominent role in the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Faced with the Manuel Azaña governments during the so-called &quot;reformist&quot; biennium, from September 1933 he would assume the presidency of the Council of Ministers and became one of the main arbiters of the political situation during the conservative biennium of 1934-1935.

His turn to the right, however, led his party to suffer several splits; His image was also badly damaged among the public by a succession of corruption scandals that became public at the end of 1935. After the collapse of the Radical Party in the 1936 elections, Lerroux disappeared from the political scene. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he went into exile in Portugal, from where he would later show his support for Francisco Franco.

==Biography==
He was initiated as Freemason around 1886 in Madrid&#x27;s Vetonica lodge of the Grand Orient of Spain, but his activity was limited, among other reasons due to his disillusion with the prospects this membership offered to his immediate purposes.

Lerroux agitated as a young man in the ranks of the radical republicans, as a follower of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla. He practised a demagogic and aggressive journalistic style in the diverse publications that he directed (&quot;El País&quot;, &quot;El Progreso&quot;, &quot;El Intransigente&quot; and &quot;El Radical&quot;).

From the 1890s onwards Lerroux radicalized his discourse. His populist and anticlerical speeches, as well as his intervention in diverse campaigns against the governments of the Restoration, made him very popular among workers in Barcelona, who later constituted the base of a loyal electorate. A prominent anti-catalanist, he became known as the &quot;Emperor of the Paralelo&quot;. In 1898 and 1899, he organized through his newspapers a campaign for the judicial review of the Montjuic trial in which forced confessions through torture had led to the execution of some of the suspects for the 1896 Barcelona Corpus Christi procession bombing. This contributed to his rise as a left-wing political force in Barcelona.

In 1906, Lerroux rallied his followers with the following exhortation: &quot;Young barbarians of today: enter and sack the decadent civilization of this unhappy country, destroy its temples, finish off its gods, tear the veil from its novices and raise them up to be mothers to virilize the species, break into the records of property and make bonfires of its papers that fire may purify the infamous social organization. Enter its humble hearths and raise the legions of proletarians that the world may tremble before their awakened judges. Do not be stopped by altars nor by tombs. Fight, kill, die.&quot;

He was elected as a member of the Congress of Deputies for the first time in 1901 and again in 1903 and 1905, as a member of the Republican Union Party that he had helped to form with Nicolás Salmerón. The defection of Salmerón to the Catalan Solidarity coalition in 1906 led Lerroux to form the Radical Republican Party (1908) and headed the struggle against increasing Catalan nationalism. There is some evidence that both Francisco Ferrer and Lerroux may have participated in the hatching of two different plots to assassinate king Alfonso XIII in 1905 and 1906. He had to go into exile on several occasions, first to escape condemnation dictated by one of his articles (1907) and later fleeing from governmental repression in response to the Tragic Week in Barcelona (1909). 

After returning to Spain, Lerroux agreed to join the Republican–Socialist Conjunction, and he was elected as a deputy again in 1910. Afterwards, he was involved in a series of scandals that moved him away from his Barcelona electorate, with corruption accusations forcing him into a change of district, appearing for Córdoba in 1914). From 1919 he was on the payroll of Barcelona Traction, part of the Anglo-Canadian Traction, Light, and Power Company.

Under the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–30), his party was debilitated when its left-wing, led by Marcelino Domingo, left to form the Radical Socialist Republican Party in 1929. However, he continued to be active in politics, attending the revolutionary committee that produced the Pact of San Sebastián with the intention of overthrowing King Alfonso XIII and proclaiming a republic.

===Second Republic===
Under the republican government, Lerroux regained a leading political role, being appointed prime minister three times between 1933 and 1935 and occupying the distinguished ministerial portfolios of War (1934) and State (1935).

He was part of the coalition of leftists that supported the reforms of Manuel Azaña&#x27;s government during the first biennium (1931–1933), during which time he served as Minister of State between 14 April 1931 and 16 December 1931. From 12 September to 9 October 1933, he was Prime Minister.

After the victory of the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) in the elections of autumn 1933, Lerroux again became prime minister, mainly because the President, Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, did not wish to appoint CEDA leader José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones. As such, he served from 16 December 1933 to 28 April 1934 and again from 4 October 1934 to 25 September 1935. He also served as minister of war (1934), state (1935) and foreign affairs (1935).

After the attempted revolution of October 1934, he fell out of favor due to the Straperlo affair (a case of corruption bound to gambling legalization), which completely broke his alliance with the right and even weakened his position within the party. This was followed by the Nombela scandal, where he participated actively by signing a contract paying a private company 3 million pesetas to perform a cancelled route, leading to his further discreditment.

In the elections of 1936, Lerroux was not elected as a deputy. The same year, the Spanish Civil War broke out and he fled to Portugal. He returned to Spain in 1947.

<text>The coat of arms of the Isle of Wight was granted to the former Isle of Wight County Council in 1938. The arms were transferred to the new unitary Isle of Wight Council when the county council along with Medina and South Wight district councils were abolished in 1995.

The shield contains an image of Carisbrooke Castle, the historical seat of many former governors of the island, and three gold anchors. The azure (blue) field and anchors are representative of Wight&#x27;s island status and maritime history. The shield is also the basis of the flag of the Isle of Wight.

The crest gold mural crown, typical of many English county arms. In the case of the Isle of Wight, three blue anchors have been added.

The supporters, both &quot;rampant&quot;, are a horse and heraldic seahorse, respectively for the agricultural and seafaring traditions known on the Isle. The white colour of these animals mirrors the use of a white horse on arms of Kent. This recalls the links with the ancient Kingdom, as both areas were settled predominantly by tribes of Jutes from the 5th century onwards.

The compartment features the sea and shoreline to further represent the island status. The motto reads &quot;All this beauty is of God&quot;.

The arms were granted to the County Council. Under the terms of the grant by the College of Arms, they can not be used by other organisations associated with the Isle of Wight, even with the council&#x27;s permission.

<doc id="644379" wikidata="Q3076178" url="?curid=644379" title="North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission">
<text>The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) is an international regional body for co-operation on conservation, management and study of marine mammals in the North Atlantic.

The NAMMCO Agreement was signed in Nuuk, Greenland on 9 April 1992 by Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, and entered into force 90 days later on 8 July 1992. The agreement focuses on modern approaches to the study of the marine ecosystem as a whole, and better understanding of marine mammals&#x27; role in this system.

The organization came about because the member nations were (and continue to be) dissatisfied with the international management of cetaceans and other marine mammals by the International Whaling Commission. NAMMCO believes that decisions regarding whaling should be based on scientific principles regarding management of whale populations. Through regional cooperation, the member nations of NAMMCO aim to strengthen and further develop effective conservation and management measures for marine mammals. Such measures should be based on the best available scientific evidence, and should take into account both the complexity and vulnerability of the marine ecosystem, and the rights and needs of coastal communities to make a sustainable living from what the sea can provide.

The IWC currently has a moratorium in effect which prohibits all (large species) whaling with a few specific exceptions. Nations opposed to whaling, such as the United Kingdom, do not recognize NAMMCO&#x27;s claim to be the proper body for management of whale stocks in the North Atlantic, and continue to support the IWC.

==History and structure==

NAMMCO was founded in Nuuk, Greenland on 9 April 1992 by the signatories to Agreement on Cooperation in Research, Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals in the North Atlantic. The Agreement came into force on 7 July 1992 and was itself the product of a Memorandum of Understanding signed in Tromsø in 1990 between the Norwegian and Icelandic governments and the Greenlandic and Faroese home rule governments. The purpose of the organization is set out in Article 2 of the agreement.

The commission has three parts. The council is the decision-making part of the commission, which requests, and acts on, advice from its management committees, which make proposals for management of marine mammals stocks within the region, and from the scientific committee which reviews current scientific literature and carries out its own scientific research.

The commission also hosts workshops and forums devoted to hunting methods and environmental questions.

==Plot==

Sammy and Terry Prescott lose their parents to a car crash. Years later, Sammy, a single mother and lending officer at a bank, still lives in her childhood home in a village in the Catskill Mountains region of New York, while Terry has drifted around the country, scraping by and getting in and out of trouble.

After months of no communication with his sister, Terry and his girlfriend Sheila are desperate for money, so he comes to visit Sammy and her son Rudy, who are excited about reuniting with him. Despite the disappointment of learning that he cut off contact because he was in jail for three months, Sammy lends him the money, which he mails back to Sheila. After Sheila attempts suicide, he decides to extend his stay with Sammy, which she welcomes.

For a school writing assignment, Rudy imagines his father, who he has no memory of, as a fantastic hero. While Sammy has always given him vague yet negative descriptions of Rudy Sr., Terry is frank with him that Rudy Sr. is not a nice person – though Rudy naively believes his father has changed. Sammy rekindles a sexual relationship with Bob, an old boyfriend, but is surprised when he proposes to her after a short time so says she needs time to consider it.

At the bank, the new manager Brian tries to make his mark with unusual demands about computer color schemes and daily timesheets. While co-worker Mabel works well with the changes, Sammy is upset when Brian requests that she make arrangements for someone else to pick up Rudy from the school bus rather than Sammy leaving work at random. After some minor arguments, they start having sex, despite Brian&#x27;s wife being six months pregnant.

Terry grows close to Rudy during their time together. Yet he pushes the limits of Sammy&#x27;s parental control, keeping Rudy out very late as the two play pool at a bar. She turns to Ron, her church minister, to counsel Terry about his outlook on life. While Terry resists his sister&#x27;s advice, he and Rudy grow steadily closer. Realizing her own questionable decisions, Sammy turns down Bob&#x27;s marriage proposal and breaks off her fling with Brian.

After a day of fishing, Terry and Rudy decide to visit Rudy Sr. in a trailer park in a nearby town. Confronted by his past, Rudy Sr. denies he is Rudy&#x27;s father and starts a brawl with Terry. Rudy watches silently as Terry beats Rudy Sr. and gets arrested.

Sammy brings her brother and son home. When Rudy insists that Rudy Sr. is not his father, Sammy finally tells him the truth. Sammy asks Terry to move out, but admits how important he is to her and Rudy, suggesting he get his own place in town and get his life back on track. He scoffs at Sammy&#x27;s idea and plans to go back to Alaska. While at first it appears the separation will be another heartache, they reconcile before Terry leaves, coming to terms with their respective paths in life.

==Production==
The story takes place in the Catskill region of south east New York state, in the fictionalized communities of Scottsville and Auburn. While there is an actual Scottsville and Auburn, New York, they are over away, in the north west Great Lakes and Finger Lakes regions of the state, respectively. The film was primarily shot in and around Margaretville, New York, a village on the border of Catskill Park, in June 1999.

While the bank exteriors were filmed at Margaretville&#x27;s NBT bank, the interiors were filmed in an unrelated bank closer to New York City, since NBT considered interior filming a security risk.

The scenes where Rudy Jr. walks home in the rain were filmed with the assistance of the Margaretville Fire Department, which used their trucks and hoses to create the rain.

Some outdoor scenes, most notably the fishing trip, were filmed in Phoenicia, New York. The Margaretville cemetery could not be seen from the road, so those scenes were shot at a cemetery outside the village, on Route 30.

==Reception==
The film received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 105 reviews are positive and the average rating is 8.1 out of 10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; may look like it belongs on the small screen, but the movie surprises with its simple yet affecting story. Beautifully acted and crafted, the movie will simply draw you in.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 31 critics.

&quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot; highly praised the film, specifically for its writing and acting. Reviewer Stephen Holden described the film as &quot;the perfectly pitched directorial debut of the playwright (&quot;This Is Our Youth&quot;) and screenwriter (&quot;Analyze This&quot;) Kenneth Lonergan. Because it arrives near the end of one of the most dismal film seasons in memory, this melancholy little gem of a movie, which won two major awards at the Sundance Film Festival, qualifies as one of the two or three finest American films released this year...&quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; is an exquisitely observed slice of upstate New York life that reminds us there are still plenty of American communities where the pace is more human than computer-driven. The movie dares to portray small-town middle-class life in America as somewhat drab and predictable. Without ever condescending to its characters, it trusts that the everyday problems of ordinary people, if portrayed with enough knowledge, empathy and insight, can be as compelling as the most bizarre screaming carnival on &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;.&quot;

David Edelstein called the film the &quot;best American movie of the year&quot;, noting that &quot;[w]hat the film is &#x27;about&#x27; can&#x27;t be summed up in a line: Its themes remain just out of reach, its major conflicts sadly unresolved. But Lonergan writes bottomless dialogue. When his people open their mouths, what comes out is never a definitive expression of character: It&#x27;s an awkward compromise between how they feel and what they&#x27;re able to say; or how they feel and what they think they should say; or how they feel and what will best conceal how they feel. The common term for this is &quot;subtext,&quot; and &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; has a subtext so powerful that it reaches out and pulls you under. Even when the surface is tranquil, you know in your guts what&#x27;s at stake.&quot; Edelstein concludes &quot;Lonergan doesn&#x27;t yet know how to make the camera show us things that his dialogue doesn&#x27;t, but when you write dialogue like he does, you can take your time to learn. Hell, he can take another 20 movies to learn.&quot;

According to Roger Ebert, &quot;Beyond and beneath, that is the rich human story of &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot;. I love the way Lonergan shows his characters in flow, pressed this way and that by emotional tides and practical considerations. This is not a movie about people solving things. This is a movie about people living day to day with their plans, fears and desires. It&#x27;s rare to get a good movie about the touchy adult relationship of a sister and brother. Rarer still for the director to be more fascinated by the process than the outcome. This is one of the best movies of the year.&quot;

In a 2016 BBC poll, &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; was voted by four critics as one of the greatest films since 2000.

==Accolades==
==Home media==
The film was released on DVD and VHS from Paramount Home Entertainment on June 26, 2001. It comes with commentary from director–writer Lonergan, cast and crew interviews, plus the theatrical trailer.

<text>In the particle physics theory of supersymmetry, a gluino (symbol ) is the hypothetical supersymmetric partner of a gluon.

In supersymmetric theories, gluinos are Majorana fermions and interact via the strong force as a color octet. Gluinos have a lepton number 0, baryon number 0, and spin 1/2.

Experimentally, gluinos have been one of the most promising SUSY particle candidates to be discovered since the production cross-section is the highest among SUSYs in the energy-frontier hadron colliders such as Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The experimental signatures are typically a pair-produced gluinos and their cascade decays. In models of supersymmetry that conserve R-parity, gluinos eventually decay into the undetected lightest super-symmetric particle with many quarks (looking as jets) and the standard model gauge bosons or Higgs bosons. In the R-parity violating scenarios, gluinos can either decay promptly into multiple jets, or be long-lived leaving anomalous sign of &quot;displaced decay vertices&quot; from the interaction point where they are generated.

There has been no sign of gluinos observed so far. The strongest limit has been set by LHC (ATLAS/CMS) where up to minimum 1 TeV and maximum 2 TeV in gluino mass has been excluded.

== In Popular Culture ==
In graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot;, chapter 1, page 23, Dr Manhattan is about to locating a gluino.

<doc id="644396" wikidata="Q1322694" url="?curid=644396" title="Tony De Vit">
<text>Antony de Vit ( ; 12 September 1957 – 2 July 1998) was an English DJ and music producer. He is considered one of the most influential of his generation. He was credited with helping to take the &quot;hard house&quot; and fast &quot;hard NRG&quot; sounds out of the London and Birmingham gay scene into mainstream clubs. His single &quot;Burning Up&quot; reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1995, with &quot;To the Limit&quot; making number 44 in September 1995. During that year, he won BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix of the Year Award, as voted by listeners of the show, and &quot;Music Week&quot;″s re-mix of Year Award for Louise&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot;. He remixed several UK top 40 hits during his career with artists such as Taylor Dayne and East 17. Between 1994 and 1998 his popularity with the clubbing public was rivaled by only Paul Oakenfold and Carl Cox. In September 2010, &quot;Mixmag&quot; UK announced the nominations of 35 DJs chosen by other big names in the world of dance music as those they considered the best DJs ever. A subsequent 15-month survey, which polled hundreds of thousands of global votes, asked who was the &quot;greatest DJ of all time&quot; and when the result was announced in January 2011, de Vit was ranked number 9.

==Early life==
Antony de Vit was born to Raymond de Vit and June Silcock in Kidderminster.

==Career==
Tony de Vit began DJing at the age of 17, as a wedding DJ in 1976 playing at local pubs in his home town of Kidderminster, followed in his early 20s, by his first residency at the Nightingale in Birmingham on a Monday night where he played pop and hi-NRG. He would often have to sweep floors and empty ashtrays after the club had closed. During the early 1980s, he worked at Wolverhampton&#x27;s Beacon Radio, playing club tracks during a regular late-night slot on the show hosted by Mike Baker of Smooth FM.

Around 1988 London&#x27;s gay superclub, Heaven was looking for an alternative DJ. For which De Vit was employed, playing the main floor two Saturdays a month.

In 1990, another soon-to-be-influential club named Trade emerged onto the scene. De Vit stood in one night for DJ Smokin&#x27; Jo. Following his set, de Vit landed his own residency at Trade. Later in his career he would perform a 12-hour DJ set on two occasions at Trade; some consider these his defining moments as a DJ.

In 1992, the illegal raves in the UK moved into the clubs in a bid to legalise the scene. One of the key figures of the house music scene at this time was a Birmingham promoter called Simon Raine, who took an interest in de Vit&#x27;s career. He put de Vit on the bill alongside Fabio and Grooverider at The Institute and encouraged him to move into other house parties as de Vit had predominately played in the gay club scene. Raine had launched the Gatecrasher club nights and, taking his advice, de Vit played at the &#x27;Chuff Chuff&#x27; events sharing the bill with Sasha.

In the same year, de Vit teamed up with Simon Parkes to create the V2 recording studio based in The Custard Factory, Gibb St, Birmingham with a view to co-write new material for de Vit to play within his sets.

At this time he recorded and released his first record, &quot;Feel the Love&quot;. His second release was a track called &quot;Higher &amp; Higher&quot;, which became the future benchmark for de Vit and Parkes&#x27; V2 concept. De Vit&#x27;s/Parkes&#x27; track &quot;Burning Up&quot; went to No. 24 on the UK top 40 charts.

In 1995, Radio 1 contacted de Vit for his first &quot;Essential Mix&quot;. de Vit featured on a number of compilation dance mix albums during this year including &quot;Fantazia House Collection Volume 2&quot; and the &quot;Remixers&quot; album, Sound Dimension&#x27;s &quot;Retrospective of House&quot; Volumes 2 &amp; 4, Boxed&#x27;s &quot;Global Underground&quot; series &quot;Live in Tel Aviv&quot;, &quot;Live in Tokyo&quot;, &quot;Kiss Mix 97&quot;, &quot;Trade&quot; Volumes 1 &amp; 3, and the international release, &quot;Trade Global Grooves&quot;.

With the launch of Jump Wax Records in 1996, hard house music in the UK became more mainstream. De Vit&#x27;s &quot;Are You All Ready?&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; received radio play and sales. Following the closure of Jump Wax Records in 1996, de Vit launched his own label (TDV Records), which saw him release &quot;Bring the Beat Back&quot; and &quot;Get Loose&quot;, both co-written with Simon Parkes. De Vit went on to play at dance clubs/events in the UK, including Legacy @ The Manor in Ringwood, Slinky @ the Opera House in Bournemouth, Cream, Gatecrasher, Godskitchen and Creamfields. He garnered a string of awards and nominations during the year, including &quot;Mixmag&quot;″s &#x27;2nd Best DJ of the Year 1996&#x27;, &quot;M8&quot; magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Best DJ of the Year 1996&#x27; and was selected by &quot;Music Week&quot; as &#x27;Top Remixer of 1996&#x27;. His remix of Louise&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot; earned &quot;Music Week&quot;″s vote as the &#x27;Ground breaking Remix of 1996&#x27;.

In 1997, de Vit was offered a show on &#x27;Kiss 100&#x27;. He was ranked number 5 in DJ Magazine&#x27;s Top 100 DJs in the World the same year. In early 1998, de Vit recorded &quot;The Dawn&quot; with Paul Janes and Andy Buckley, which was part of the six-track &quot;Trade EP&quot;. De Vit commented that he was &#x27;very proud of it&#x27;. Paul Janes went on to remix &quot;The Dawn&quot; as a tribute to de Vit&#x27;s work. The track has been considered to be his best work.

==Death==
He tested HIV+ in 1996. His drug regime never settled and he suffered many side effects. On 2 July 1998, at the age of 40, he died of bronchial failure and bone marrow failure at Heartlands Hospital in East Birmingham. He had collapsed a few days earlier during a holiday in Miami, Florida. After de Vit&#x27;s death, a conflict kept his records unavailable for many years, but finally a compilation album of his songs and remixes was released called &quot;Are You All Ready?&quot; on Tidy Trax records.

==Influence and legacy==
The influence of the Tony De Vit is sufficiently significant for the music press to dub him the &quot;godfather of UK hard house&quot;, and in 2023 the DJ Mag journalist Stewart Who cited him as a &quot;true hero of UK dance music&quot;. A number of artists have cited Tony de Vit as an influence, such as Fergie, Andy Farley, Dave Pearce, Paul F1 King, Steven J, and Lisa Lashes.

In 2022 a blue plaque commemorating De Vit was unveiled at the Custard Factory in Digbeth, Birmingham, where he had a recording studio. In 2023 to commemorate the 25 year anniversary of his death, the record label Tidy Trax released a compilation of remixes of De Vit&#x27;s work by artists including Eats Everything, Nicole Moudaber and Hannah Laing, and a documentary about his life was released by Restless Films, called &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Stop: Tony De Vit&quot;.

<doc id="644397" wikidata="Q1476975" url="?curid=644397" title="Hush kit">
<text>A hush kit is an aerodynamic device used to help reduce the noise produced by older aircraft jet engines. These devices are typically installed on older turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines, as they are much louder than later high-bypass turbofan engines. 

Hush kits are used because the engines on jet aircraft generate a large amount of noise, which significantly increases noise pollution near airports.

==Design==
The most common form of hush kit is a multi-lobe exhaust mixer. This device is fitted to the rear of the engine and mixes the jet core&#x27;s exhaust gases with the surrounding air and a small amount of available bypass air. Modern high-bypass turbofan engines build on this principle by utilizing available bypass air to envelop the jet-core exhaust at the rear of the engine, reducing noise.

Most hush kits make further modifications to the exhaust, including acoustically treated tailpipes, revised inlet nacelles and guide vanes. They reduce the forward propagating, high-pitched noise caused by the small, high-speed fan.

This kind of high-pitched noise is much less of an issue on modern high-bypass turbofan engines as the significantly larger front fans they employ are designed to spin at much lower speeds than those found in older turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines.

==Use==
Modern aircraft equipped with mid and high-bypass turbofan engines are designed to comply with contemporary aviation noise abatement laws and ICAO regulations. Several older aircraft that are still in service (typically in a cargo capacity) have hush kits retrofitted so that they are able to conform with noise regulations needed to operate in many commercial airports. Some of the examples include:

* Boeing 707
* Boeing 727
* Boeing 737-100
* Boeing 737-200
* Douglas DC-8
* Douglas DC-9
* Gulfstream II
* Gulfstream III
* Learjet 23
* Learjet 24
* Learjet 25
* Learjet 28

==Impact==
Hush kits can adversely affect the range and performance of the aircraft they are fitted to because of the extra weight. It also reduces engine performance and aerodynamic efficiency. For example, the hush kit fitted to the Gulfstream II adds to the total airplane weight of , causing around a 1.6% reduction in aircraft range. 

Meanwhile, the hush kit for the Gulfstream G-III jets weighs about and cause a calculated 2% drop in range, although the reduction in range has not been noticed during actual flights, which are rarely made to the very limit of the aircraft&#x27;s range. 

On a larger aircraft, like FedEx&#x27;s Boeing 727s, the hush kits add of extra weight (total airplane weight up to ) and this results in an overall 0.5% increase in fuel burn for short trips (but no measurable increase for long flights).

==Regulation==
While hush kits effectively reduce noise emissions from older aircraft, noise cannot always be reduced to the level of modern planes at a reasonable cost.

In 1999, this concern led to a regulatory dispute between the United States and the European Union, where the EU proposed a new noise ordinance which effectively prevented the use of hush kits in Europe. By December 31, 1999, all Stage 2 noise jetliners 75,000 pounds or more operating in the US must have Stage 3 hush kits in order to continue to fly in the US after January 1, 2000. This regulation threatened to reduce the value of the mostly-American used airplanes that employed hush kits and hurt the profits of American hush kit manufacturers. EU Regulation 925/99 was passed over US threats to ban Concorde but was superseded (and effectively repealed) by EU Directive No. 2002/30/EC issued March 26, 2002.

In 2013, the FAA modified 14 CFR part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not Stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015. Any Stage 2 Business jets 75,000 pounds or below that have not been modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had Stage 3 hush kits installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015. &quot;14 CFR §91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less&quot; – lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015.

<doc id="644398" wikidata="Q973050" url="?curid=644398" title="Betsy Braddock">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Herb Trimpe, she first appeared in &quot;Captain Britain&quot; (vol. 1) #8 in 1976 as a supporting character for her twin brother Brian Braddock. Although she is initially depicted as a precognitive telepath, Betsy is later established to be a mutant, a subspecies of humans born with an &quot;X-gene&quot; that grants superhuman abilities, when she joins the X-Men in 1986 and becomes one of its most prominent members as [[Psylocke]]. A 1989 story written by Claremont and illustrated by Jim Lee redesigned Betsy as a Japanese woman, which was retroactively revealed years later to be the result of a body swap with the ninja assassin Kwannon. Following nearly 30 years of publication history, both women were returned to their original bodies, and Betsy took up the mantle of [[Captain Britain]] from her brother while Kwannon became the second Psylocke.

The character has been adapted in various media incarnations, including films, television series, and video games, having most notably been portrayed by Olivia Munn in the 2016 film &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;.

==Publication history==
===Origins===

Created by writer Chris Claremont, Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock first appeared in &quot;Captain Britain&quot; #8 (December 1976), with &quot;Captain Britain&quot; #10 (December 1976) as her first cover appearance, published by the Marvel Comics&#x27; British imprint Marvel UK. The original spelling of the character&#x27;s name was &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, though relettering of the UK versions for American reprints would occasionally misspell it as &quot;Elisabeth&quot;. This led to spelling inconsistencies throughout future publications. The inconsistency was resolved by Claremont 32 years later in 2008 in the series &quot;New Exiles&quot;, which reasserted the particular spelling of her name as &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. In the &quot;Captain Britain&quot; series, Claremont introduced her as a supporting character, the sister of Brian Braddock, the eponymous Captain Britain, and established her career as a . He also established that she had psychic abilities, the full extent of which were unknown, though no explanation is given for these powers. In Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain&quot; #243 (October 1977), Betsy Braddock is presented as a professional model.

In Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Daredevils&quot; #3 (March 1983), Alan Moore established that the character has begun to work for the fictional governmental organization S.T.R.I.K.E., who are making use of her psychic abilities. Her lover Tom Lennox is also a S.T.R.I.K.E operative and is later murdered. The story also presents the character as having dyed her hair purple after being blonde; this hair color has subsequently become the dominant presentation of the character. The next major change for the character came in the 1986 relaunched &quot;Captain Britain&quot; series, where Betsy Braddock stands in for her brother as Captain Britain, and is rendered blind by the supervillain Slaymaster.

===X-Men===

In &quot;New Mutants Annual&quot; #2 (1986), Claremont integrated Betsy Braddock into the X-Men franchise. The story sees her abducted to the Mojoverse, where she is subjected to brainwashing, fitted with bionic eyes, and referred to as &quot;the Psylocke&quot; for the first time. After being rescued by the New Mutants, she takes up residence at their mutant-training academy, run by Magneto at the time in the absence of Professor Charles Xavier. After aiding the team unofficially, Braddock proves herself by distracting the attentions of the murderous supervillain Sabretooth. Afterward, Braddock is formally invited to join the X-Men and officially adopts the codename &quot;Psylocke&quot;, becoming an enduring fixture of the team over the next three decades.

Initially written as a pure non-mutant telepath with few fighting skills, Betsy later adopts body armor. In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #251 (November 1989), the X-Men flee from the cybernetic terrorists, the Reavers, through the Siege Perilous, an extra-dimensional teleportation device. The now-amnesiac Betsy is taken in by the Hand, who brainwash and physically alter her to take on an East Asian appearance so that she can blend in in Hong Kong. Braddock now believes herself to be &quot;Lady Mandarin&quot;, the Hand&#x27;s supreme assassin. After she is rescued by the X-Men&#x27;s Wolverine and overcomes her brainwashing, the character retains the combat skills granted through the Hand&#x27;s modification techniques as well as the ability to manifest her total focused telepathy in the form of a &quot;psychic knife&quot;.

With the launch of the second volume of &quot;X-Men&quot; (later rebranded &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;) in 1991, the team splits, with Betsy joining the team led by Cyclops. In Jim Lee-written issues, the character becomes flirtatious with Cyclops, eventually attempting to seduce him. At this point, Kwannon, a new character with the physical appearance of Betsy prior to the Hand&#x27;s manipulation, claims to be the original Betsy Braddock, accusing the Japanese-featured Betsy of being an impostor. After Jim Lee and six other creators left Marvel Comics to found Image Comics, new scriptwriter Fabian Nicieza established that Kwannon is the impostor and that Braddock&#x27;s flirtations with Cyclops were part of a genetic and mental splicing in which the Kwannon impostor was first created, a body swap having occurred.

In 1994, writer Scott Lobdell set up a relationship between Betsy Braddock and her teammate Archangel. The character is severely injured by a crazed Sabretooth in the Lobdell-written &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #328. Her life is saved by the use of a mystic artifact known as the Crimson Dawn, the aftereffects of which granted Betsy the ability to teleport in and out of shadows. Lobdell also temporarily took her out of the X-Men roster this issue. Braddock returns to the team in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #77–78, where she uses her Crimson Dawn-enhanced telepathy to trap the Shadow King in the astral plane. Any use of her telepathy would result in his release, so she forgoes the use of her telepathic ability. Some time later she would develop telekinesis for the first time instead. Betsy&#x27;s relationship with Archangel ends in the Claremont written &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #109, where the character embarks upon a relationship with new Indian X-Men recruit Neal Shaara, also known as Thunderbird.

In the Claremont-written &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #2 (2001), the character dies, her comic book death lasting until 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #455; Claremont also wrote this issue, later stating he had always intended to revive her. Briefly, the character was depicted in &quot;Exiles&quot;, a spin-off comic-book series in the X-Men franchise, set in an alternate universe. With the cancellation of &quot;New Exiles&quot;, Betsy Braddock starred in her first solo book, the &quot;X-Men: Sword of The Braddocks&quot; one-shot. Afterwards, the character was brought back to the main Marvel Universe in early 2009 within the pages of &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;.

In addition to appearing in many X-related team titles over the decades, Psylocke (both Betsy Braddock and Kwannon) have appeared in several limited series. In the year of 1997, the characters appeared in the 4-issue team-up series &quot;Psylocke and Archangel: Crimson Dawn.&quot; Beginning in November 2009, Betsy Braddock was featured in &quot;X-Men: Psylocke&quot; a self-titled four issue miniseries written by Christopher Yost and drawn by Harvey Tolibao; Matsu&#x27;o Tsurayaba and Wolverine are central characters in the story.

Cebulski and writer Jonathan Hickman revealed that, following the franchise-wide relaunch &quot;House of X/Powers of X&quot;, Betsy Braddock would become the new Captain Britain, with Brian adopting the new title of Captain Avalon and Kwannon taking over the Psylocke moniker. Cebulski compared Betsy&#x27;s adoption of the Captain Britain mantle to Carol Danvers&#x27;s transition to Captain Marvel, indicating that this new status quo would be permanent. As part of the Dawn of X, a new volume of &quot;Excalibur&quot; written by Tini Howard was launched, with Braddock leading a new lineup of the titular team consisting of herself, Gambit, Rogue, Jubilee, Rictor and Apocalypse. Braddock was included a central character in the &quot;X of Swords&quot; crossover by Howard and Hickman. Following the completion of Howard&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; run, Braddock was featured in the &quot;Knights of X&quot; miniseries and &quot;Captain Britain: Betsy Braddock&quot;, with Betsy and her long-time friend Rachel Summers confessing their romantic feelings for each other, with their kiss shown in a splash page.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock was born in England and was raised in the small town of Maldon, Essex. Betsy was Sir James Braddock&#x27;s second child, born minutes before her twin brother Brian. The twins and their elder brother Jamie, who was nearly a decade older, had a very privileged life. By the time she entered college, Betsy had become a charter pilot. After she and Jamie were taken hostage by the Red Skull&#x27;s agents and freed by Captain America and Captain Britain, Betsy learned the latter was her brother Brian. At this time Betsy began to develop precognitive powers. She dyed her hair purple and took up modeling. At the age of twenty-one, her psychic powers fully manifested, which grew to include telepathy. Agent Matthew recruited Betsy into S.T.R.I.K.E.&#x27;s Psi Division, and she became fellow psi Tom Lennox&#x27;s lover. As she had inherited membership to the Hellfire Club from her father, Betsy was sent to infiltrate it, but was warned off by Tessa for her own protection. She also met future boyfriend Warren Worthington for the first time during one of the Hellfire Club parties.

When the crime lord Vixen hired Slaymaster to eliminate the Psi-Division, only Betsy, Tom Lennox, and their friend Alison Double were left when Brian defeated him. When reality warped due to James Jaspers&#x27; powers, Tom sacrificed himself to give the Braddocks time to escape from a group of superhero hunters. Betsy was in Tom&#x27;s mind when he died; feeling his death, she was left traumatized. Following the repair of the reality warp, an evil version of Captain Britain from another universe named Kaptain Briton switched places with Brian. The double tried to rape Betsy. In self-defense, she telepathically killed him. The same night, the twins were informed of their father&#x27;s Otherworld origins, and a new intelligence agency called R.C.X. asked them to billet Warpies, children transformed by Jasper&#x27;s warp, at the Manor, which led to an argument between Betsy and Brian.

====As Captain Britain====
When Brian went overseas, Matthew (now codenamed Gabriel) convinced Betsy to become the new Captain Britain, wearing Kaptain Briton&#x27;s modified costume. Working with Captain UK, the duo became public sensations. After several months, crime boss Vixen lured Betsy into a showdown with Slaymaster. During the battle, Betsy called Vixen a &quot;hag&quot;, which angered her. Vixen instructed Slaymaster that she wanted Betsy&#x27;s eyes, so he brutally beat Betsy, then gouged her eyes out. Brian flew to her rescue and killed Slaymaster as Vixen escaped. Betsy refused R.C.X.&#x27;s offer of cybernetic eyes, preferring to rely on her psychic abilities to &quot;see&quot;. She and Gabriel went to former S.T.R.I.K.E. Psi co-agent Alison Double&#x27;s Switzerland chateau for Betsy to recuperate.

====As Psylocke ====

Betsy was kidnapped from the Alps by Mojo, brainwashed, given cybernetic eyes, and, as &quot;Psylocke&quot;, became the star of his new show &quot;Wildways&quot;. Brian and the New Mutants rescued her, after which Betsy moved to the X-Men&#x27;s mansion to recover, exactly where Roma, Guardian of the Omniverse, needed her to be. When the Marauders attacked the Morlocks, the X-Mansion was used as a temporary infirmary for injured survivors of the massacre. Knowing that the X-Men were away in New York, the Marauder Sabretooth invaded the mansion. Betsy used herself as bait to lead him away from the injured until the X-Men arrived to help her. While Sabretooth and Wolverine fought, Betsy used her telepathy to gather information about the Marauders and their leader, Mr. Sinister, from Sabretooth&#x27;s mind. Wolverine, though initially reluctant to involve outsiders in the X-Men&#x27;s affairs, was impressed by her bravery and nominated her to join the team.

As an X-Man she met Mephisto, Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four, and the Horde. The X-Men later battled Freedom Force and the Adversary in Dallas, and, in a televised battle, sacrificed themselves to allow Forge to bind the Adversary; Roma secretly restored them to life, and gave Betsy the Siege Perilous, which they could use if they ever wanted to start new lives. The X-Men moved to the Reavers&#x27; Australian Outback base, from where they took on the Brood, Genoshan Magistrates, Mister Sinister and the Goblin Queen, M Squad, Mr. Jip and the Serpent Society, Master Mold and Nimrod, Nanny and Orphan-Maker, and Zaladane and the Savage Land Mutates. As they were about to depart the Savage Land, Betsy had a precognitive flash of the Reavers killing the team. To prevent this, she telepathically &quot;convinces&quot; them to abandon the Outback, and subsequently sends them through the Siege Perilous.

===Lady Mandarin and body swap===

Betsy reappeared amnesiac on an island near China, where the Hand, a ninja clan, found her. Matsu&#x27;o Tsurayaba, their leader, saw a chance to save his brain-dead lover, Kwannon. Spiral informed Matsu&#x27;o that Betsy&#x27;s telepathy could restore Kwannon, and Matsu&#x27;o accepted. Unknown to Matsu&#x27;o, however, Spiral actually placed the two women&#x27;s minds into each other&#x27;s bodies. She also merged their genetic structures, leaving both women with physical and mental traits of the other, and with each possessing half of Betsy&#x27;s telepathic power. With some physical and mental conditioning, Betsy—inhabiting Kwannon&#x27;s body—became the Hand&#x27;s prime assassin, taking the name Lady Mandarin. She gained highly remarkable fighting skills and learned to focus her telepathic power into a &quot;psychic knife&quot;. Lady Mandarin&#x27;s first mission pitted her against Wolverine. Betsy&#x27;s psychic knife attack revealed Wolverine&#x27;s memories of who she used to be and allowed her to break free from the Hand&#x27;s conditioning.

Betsy rejected her role as Lady Mandarin and escaped with Wolverine and Jubilee, eventually going with them to the island nation of Genosha, where the New Mutants had been kidnapped along with the X-Men&#x27;s leader, Storm, by Cameron Hodge. Following Hodge&#x27;s defeat, the X-Men reunited and returned to New York. Betsy then joined the Blue Team led by Cyclops, for whom she displayed an obvious attraction. When Phoenix found out, the two women fought, but were interrupted by the arrival of Kwannon, now calling herself Revanche, in Betsy&#x27;s former body, claiming to be the real Betsy. Unable to discern which was truly Betsy, both stayed with the X-Men, maintaining an uneasy coexistence. Learning she had the Legacy Virus, Revanche had Matsu&#x27;o kill her, restoring Betsy&#x27;s full personality and telepathic potential. Having become involved with her teammate Angel, the following months saw her fight the Phalanx, try to reach Jamie&#x27;s comatose mind, battle Legion in Israel, and combat Gene Nation.

===Crimson Dawn===
Betsy was gutted by Sabretooth which led Angel, Wolverine, Doctor Strange and Gomurr the Ancient to retrieve a magical liquid from the Crimson Dawn dimension to heal her. This gave her the new ability to teleport through shadows, also marking her with a red tattoo over her left eye. Her personality took on a cold edge, which created distance between her and Warren. Kuragari, Proctor of the Crimson Dawn, tried to claim Betsy as his bride, but was thwarted with Gomurr and Angel&#x27;s aid, freeing Betsy of the Dawn&#x27;s influence. Betsy retained the abilities associated with it. Soon after these events, the couple retired from active duty with the X-Men.

Subsequently, she aided Storm against the Shadow King, who tricked Betsy into initiating a psychic shockwave that disabled all other telepaths, leaving him unchallenged on the astral plane. Her own astral form was destroyed, but her exposure to the Crimson Dawn gave her a new shadow form with temporarily enhanced powers, which she used to trap the Shadow King&#x27;s core. To keep him trapped she was forced to constantly focus her telepathy on him, effectively rendering herself powerless.

===Revolution and X-Treme===
Jean Grey&#x27;s attempt to help Betsy deal with the Shadow King somehow swapped their powers, leaving Betsy telekinetic. With her new abilities Betsy fought Belasco, the Neo, the Goth, the Crimson Pirates, the Twisted Sisters, and the Prime Sentinels, then aided her brother freeing Otherworld from Mastermind&#x27;s Warpie army. After ending her relationship with Archangel, Betsy joined Storm&#x27;s X-Treme X-Men team in the search for Destiny&#x27;s diaries.

In Valencia, Betsy died in combat with the man known as Vargas while protecting Rogue and Beast, who were badly beaten by the villain. Brian Braddock and Meggan collected Betsy&#x27;s body from Spain. She was buried at the Braddock family estate and a memorial to her was erected at the X-Mansion by Beast.

===Resurrection===
One year after her death, Betsy awoke where she had died, unaware of how she had been resurrected, and was soon reunited with the X-Men, helping them against the Saurian Hauk&#x27;ka, and Mojo and Spiral. Jamie started to covertly observe his resurrected sister, allowing her to catch occasional glimpses of him. Betsy was reunited with Brian during the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s &quot;House of M&quot; reality storm. When the timeline was set right, the memories of their encounter took on a dreamlike state, prompting Betsy and several of the X-Men to visit London to check on Brian&#x27;s status.

Back in the US, Betsy and the X-Men failed to stop Shi&#x27;ar Death Commandos from slaughtering the Grey family, targeted for death because of their relationship to Phoenix, but helped defeat them before they could kill Rachel Grey. With the First Fallen&#x27;s servants, the Foursaken, about to make their move, Jamie revealed his part in Betsy&#x27;s resurrection to the X-Men: sensing the approaching threat of the cosmically powerful First Fallen (a harbinger of frozen, eternal &quot;perfection&quot;) and learning of Betsy&#x27;s demise, an annoyed Jamie resurrected her, reaching back through time to stop her spirit passing into the afterlife. Intending her to be a weapon to use against the First Fallen, Jamie tightened up the &quot;quantum strings&quot; of Betsy&#x27;s body, rendering her mostly immune to external manipulation, enhancing her telekinetic powers, and leaving her invisible to the First Fallen&#x27;s senses. Jamie was abducted by the Foursaken before he could fully inform them of the imminent threat; trying to rescue him, the X-Men were easily captured, except Betsy, who found herself invisible to the Foursaken&#x27;s senses. Disrupting their attempt to give the First Fallen full access to Earth, Betsy and the X-Men were pulled into his realm, the Singing City, where Betsy&#x27;s immunity to his mental control allowed her to free the city&#x27;s residents, including the Foursaken, from his dominance. As a wrathful First Fallen turned on them, Jamie sent the X-Men home while he held the entity back, apparently sacrificing himself.

Returning to the UK to tell Brian of Jamie&#x27;s fate, Betsy learned that Shadow Xavier, leader of the Shadow X-Men, had taken over the minds of his jailors in Crossmore Prison, and was demanding to see her. Accompanied by Excalibur, Betsy visited the prison, where Xavier revealed his true identity as the Shadow King, and tried to take revenge, having Excalibur attack Brian so that Betsy could witness his death; however, immune to his control, Betsy telekinetically induced a stroke in Xavier&#x27;s body, freeing Excalibur. Before she could finish him off, Betsy was interdimensionally teleported to the Crystal Palace at the Nexus of All Realities.

===Exiles===
Appearing at the headquarters of the Exiles, heroes gathered from several realities to protect the Omniverse; both the Exiles&#x27; choice of Betsy as latest recruit, and the timing of same, were apparently the result of Roma&#x27;s manipulations, again moving one of her pawns to where it would soon be needed as part of a greater plan. Her first mission with the Exiles brought Betsy face to face with Earth-1720&#x27;s Slaymaster, brutally reminding her of her reality&#x27;s Slaymaster blinding her. After escaping, Slaymaster-1720 began murdering Betsy Braddock in each reality he visited.

Meanwhile, determined to confront her fear, Betsy began rigorous training to prepare herself for their next encounter. She returned to Earth-616 to let Brian know she was alive. Almost immediately both the Exiles and Excalibur were called to the defense of Otherworld, under attack by an army of Furies created by a resurrected Mad Jim Jaspers; though the heroes prevailed, the Exiles were left as the Omniverse&#x27;s primary defenders until the devastated Captain Britain Corps could be rebuilt. Choosing to remain with the Exiles, Betsy traveled to several realities. Upon arriving on a certain Earth, Betsy had a mental breakdown due to her counterpart of this world&#x27;s psyche being at war with Betsy&#x27;s own psyche to control her body. This reality&#x27;s Ogun approached Betsy and offered to train her so she could avenge the death of his apprentice, who was killed by Slaymaster. Betsy eventually tracked him to Earth-616 and killed him. Betsy returned to the Crystal Palace, became involved with teammate Sabretooth, and promised to honor her mission as an Exile.

===Return===
Somehow, Betsy became trapped between parallel worlds and was rescued by Madelyne Pryor – now calling herself the Red Queen – who controlled her to join the Sisterhood. They also stole Betsy&#x27;s original body, in which Kwannon had died, at a graveyard. A ritual of sorts with both bodies was performed, resulting in Betsy&#x27;s original body being brought back to life. The Sisterhood, now including a brainwashed Betsy, attacked the X-Men. Dazzler was forced to use her powers on Betsy, blowing half of her face off. Dazzler&#x27;s attack shocked Betsy back to consciousness, enabling her to overcome the Red Queen&#x27;s control and return to her Japanese body.

After these events, Betsy&#x27;s powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, but with her psionic potential divided between them, neither ability is as strong as it once was. The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast&#x27;s The X-Club. Betsy also led the X-Club in a mission to raise Asteroid M, which was at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, to serve as the X-Men&#x27;s new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called Utopia. Soon after, Betsy went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu&#x27;o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Betsy tracked Matsu&#x27;o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine&#x27;s yearly revenge on Matsu&#x27;o for his role in the murder of Mariko Yashida. Matsu&#x27;o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Betsy to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform seppuku himself. This put Betsy at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu&#x27;o&#x27;s punishment was not over yet. Betsy engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine&#x27;s permission, Betsy finished Matsu&#x27;o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions into his mind of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Betsy quickly killed him with her psi-blade.

During the Nation X storyline, Betsy, Wolverine, and Colossus were sent down into the sewers under San Francisco to investigate the case of a missing Predator X. They ran into Fantomex, who had slain the beast. Betsy battled Sublime&#x27;s associates with the help of Fantomex and her teammates. During the Necrosha storyline, Betsy joined Rogue&#x27;s team sent to Muir Island to battle the resurrected Proteus. Betsy appeared to have lost her immunity to telepathic attacks and reality alterations, as Proteus easily possessed her. However, her psi-blade was able to break his hold on his hosts. Following the return of Cable and Hope Summers, Betsy was selected as part of Cyclops&#x27; &quot;Alpha roster&quot; of X-Men sent to locate and protect the two from the forces of Bastion.

===Uncanny X-Force===
In the aftermath of &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot;, Betsy (along with Deadpool, Fantomex, and Archangel) was selected by Wolverine to be a member of the new X-Force; the sole condition being that no one could learn of the team&#x27;s existence. Betsy had been using her telepathy to help Warren control the &quot;Archangel&quot; persona in his mind, which led to the two rekindling their previous relationship. The team&#x27;s first mission was to locate and kill Apocalypse, who had been reborn. Upon discovering that the reborn Apocalypse was a child, most of the team decided against killing him, but Fantomex fatally shot the boy. With X-Force, Betsy also faced long-time rivals such as the Reavers and the Shadow King. The latter succeeded in freeing the Archangel persona in Warren. To prevent Archangel&#x27;s ascension into Apocalypse, X-Force traveled to the Age of Apocalypse to seek a Life Seed, which could cleanse Warren. Betsy&#x27;s hesitation to kill Archangel led to her transformation into the Horseman of Death at his hands. Jean Grey of the Age of Apocalypse managed to revert this process, unlocking a previously untapped power in Betsy&#x27;s mind, who became a full-fledged Omega-class telepath after these events. Betsy stabbed Archangel with the Life Seed, killing Warren and creating a new being in his likeness in the process.

After the Schism between the X-Men, while Betsy decided to stay on Utopia under Cyclops&#x27; leadership, she secretly remained part of X-Force to help whenever Wolverine requested. Cyclops also placed her in charge of a new X-Men Security team, asking her to be his spy and spy-hunter.

Soon after, Captain Britain learned of Betsy&#x27;s activities with X-Force through their bond and decided to retrieve her to Otherworld, where Jamie Braddock was revealed to be alive, and punish Fantomex for his crimes. Betsy took up the Lady Briton mantle to rescue Fantomex and was ultimately forced to kill Jamie to prevent his future self from destroying the multiverse. X-Force faced a new Brotherhood of Mutants, of which the Shadow King was a member. Betsy imprisoned his psyche for good into Omega White, whose ability was to eat psychic energy. After this last mission, X-Force disbanded for good and Fantomex, who had been keeping a relationship with Betsy, but died at the hands of the Brotherhood, was resurrected in three different bodies for each of his brains.

As a member of Cyclops&#x27; Extinction Team, Betsy dealt with the fallout from Archangel&#x27;s machinations in Tabula Rasa and sided with the X-Men against the Avengers once the Phoenix Force returned to Earth to reclaim a host. However, Daredevil made Betsy question her motives, and she joined the Avengers, the X-Men and Nova in the final battle against Cyclops.

===Marvel NOW!===
After the events of &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, Betsy and Fantomex spent weeks in Paris, engaging in drinking, sex and thieving. While Betsy and Fantomex grew apart, she and Cluster – Fantomex&#x27; female self – grew closer and more devoted to each other, resulting in a romantic relationship. Feeling jealous about the new couple, Fantomex set Betsy up to be blamed for a crime. Once Cluster sided with him over Betsy, Betsy decided to leave them both for good.

Upon returning to New York, Betsy took a teaching position at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Due to Betsy&#x27;s constant assaulting of the students and aggressiveness, Wolverine was forced to fire her, and instead assigned her a mission to take down Spiral. With the help of Storm and Puck, Betsy faced her longtime rival and Bishop, who had returned to the present day. After taking a trip through Bishop&#x27;s mind, Betsy managed to tame the Demon Bear in his psyche, making an unusual ally of it. She also rescued Fantomex from Weapon XIII at Cluster&#x27;s request, but left them once more. Bishop&#x27;s alliance with Betsy&#x27;s group put them at war with Cassandra Nova – the Revenant Queen – who wished to unleash her revenants (or mummudrai) on Earth. Betsy ultimately stabbed her to death, breaking her vow not to kill again. Betsy&#x27;s group also teamed up with Cable&#x27;s X-Force to rescue Bishop and Hope Summers, both kidnapped by Stryfe. Betsy&#x27;s posture in this mission impressed Cable.

As a member of the X-Men, Betsy joined an all-female squad led by Storm alongside Rogue, Kitty Pryde and Rachel Summers, and later Omega Sentinel and Monet, taking on villains such as Arkea, the Brotherhood from a future timeline, Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s Sisterhood and The Future. During this time, Betsy started focusing her powers into different weapons of psychic energy such as a bow and arrow, a crossbow and a grappling line and a flail, mentored a small group of students consisted of Hellion, Anole, Broo and Rockslide and kept a relationship with a virtual boyfriend created in the Danger Room.

===All-New Marvel NOW!===
In the wake of a terrorist attack known as the Alexandria Incident, which claimed 3,000 lives, Cable re-formed the mutant black ops team X-Force so that mutantkind not only had a continued place in the world, but also had a stake in it. While Cable recruited Fantomex, Marrow and Dr. Nemesis as his teammates, Betsy actually sought Cable because she couldn&#x27;t bear staying away from X-Force as she admitted she was addicted to killing. Their first mission had the team track and face Volga, a wealthy business man responsible for the abduction and weaponization of several mutants and depowered mutants. As a member of X-Force, Braddock grew more bloodthirsty, self-loathing and broken by the day, admitting that resorting to killing was the only way she could feel anything at all. She also kept a sexual relationship with Cable. X-Force also faced Fantomex, who was driven to the point of insanity and received god-like powers. Betsy ultimately used her mind blade to scramble Fantomex&#x27;s brain.

As a member of the X-Men, Betsy investigated the Shi&#x27;ar&#x27;s Providian Order, while taking on Skrull/Brood hybrids, investigated a mysterious natural phenomena in the Blackrock Desert, helped Nightcrawler against a newly returned Shadow King, and joined the X-Men and Avengers in Genosha to fight the clone of Red Skull during the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline. Months later, Betsy and the X-Men took refuge in the X-Nation under Cyclops&#x27; leadership, when Earth-616 suffered from an early death as a consequence of the multiversal phenomena known as the incursions.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
The intervention of Mister Fantastic in the rebirth of Earth-616 caused the Marvel Universe to be a direct continuation of the previous iteration. As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Betsy reappeared in a world where the Terrigen released in the atmosphere by the Inhumans proved to be deadly to mutants. For this reason, Magneto invited Betsy to be a partner in his endeavors and protect mutantkind. He also offered her the chance to work with a blank slate clone of Archangel he had come across earlier. Although not fully agreeing with Magneto&#x27;s methods, Betsy remained part of his team, alongside Monet and Sabretooth, for the sake of rehabilitating Archangel, whom she kept under telepathic control. Magneto&#x27;s X-Men first mission had them face the Dark Riders, who were targeting mutant healers. Following a lead buried in the dormant Archangel&#x27;s mind, Betsy and Magneto travelled to Colorado, where they found a wingless Warren Worthington brainwashed by the son of Apocalypse, Genocide, and Clan Akkaba, who were harvesting his wings to create an army of Archangel clones. When Warren and Archangel merged, Betsy started working with him to restore the man she once knew and loved.

Once Ulysses, an Inhuman with the ability to forecast the future, emerged, Betsy briefly changed alliances, siding with Storm&#x27;s X-Men in opposition to Magneto&#x27;s team, who wanted to eliminate the boy. Betsy also found out Magneto had secretly employed Mystique and Fantomex and made an alliance with the Hellfire Club, much to her annoyance. After the X-Men foiled Someday Corporation&#x27;s plans to weaponize mutants, Betsy quit the team, vowing to keep an eye on Magneto&#x27;s operations and putting an end to them if he ever crossed the line. On her own, Betsy tracked down and defeated threats to mutantkind such as Omega Sentinels, Sauron and the Nasty Boys. Betsy also faced Mystique, stabilizing the shapeshifter&#x27;s psyche once and for all.

When Beast discovered that the Terrigen was saturating and would soon render Earth completely uninhabitable for mutants, Betsy joined the rest of the X-Men in their war against the Inhumans, seeking to destroy the cloud while the Inhumans fought to protect it. After the war ended, Magneto&#x27;s team of X-Men disbanded and Betsy learned that he was working alongside Emma Frost and knew about her deceptions that led to the war. Making good on her promise, Betsy found Magneto and killed him. She then walked away, feeling like the world and the X-Men were better off without her. When Captain America and Hydra took over the United States, Betsy and a few mutants relocated to the mutant sovereign republic of New Tian, under the leadership of Xorn, who was mind controlled by Emma Frost behind the scenes.

===ResurrXion===
While the X-Men rebuilt the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach in the middle of Central Park, Betsy decided to return to England. After spending some time in London, Betsy found herself under an overwhelming psychic attack by the Shadow King, which caused her to lose control. Betsy called for help and Rogue, Bishop, Archangel, Gambit, Fantomex and Old Man Logan came to her rescue. She sent the X-Men to the Astral Plane to deal with Farouk and remained behind to maintain the necessary mental link back to the physical world. Betsy found out the Shadow King was keeping Charles Xavier&#x27;s soul trapped in the Astral Plane, and under the Professor&#x27;s guidance, she managed to fight Logan and Gambit, both possessed by the Shadow King, contain the psychic infection in London and protect the civilians. After Xavier killed the Shadow King, Betsy was shocked to learn he had taken over the body of Fantomex, who chose to remain in the Astral Plane.

Suspicious of X, as now Xavier started to call himself, Betsy travelled to the Astral Plane herself to make sure Fantomex wasn&#x27;t fooled into giving up his body. Unbeknownst to the X-Men, X had unintentionally brought someone else with him, a newly resurrected Proteus. Not willing to take a risk with such a powerful being on the loose, the X-Men appointed Betsy as their leader over X and attacked Proteus, ultimately defeating him with a combined effort. However, when Betsy tapped into a psychic network to undo Proteus&#x27; reality-bending madness, the Shadow King took the chance to return to the physical world. Betsy and X joined forces to defeat him once more, linking every psychic telepathically and cleansing the world of Farouk&#x27;s filth. X erased the memories of the other X-Men and told Betsy she would be the only one to remember he had returned.

As a member of the X-Men, Betsy also tutored the time-displaced Jean Grey in the art of creating psychic weaponry and investigated the Phoenix-related phenomenon that led to the resurrection of the adult Jean Grey. Betsy was also selected by Kitty Pryde to join a team with Storm, Rogue, Jubilee and Domino and hunt for a resurrected Wolverine, facing Viper and her Femme Fatales along the way.

During this encounter, Betsy was attacked by the psychic vampire, Sapphire Styx who absorbed her soul into herself. Once inside, Betsy discovered the psychic husks of all the victims Sapphire had claimed over the centuries, including a fragment of Wolverine&#x27;s soul that she had been unable to purge from herself. Drawing on the strength of all the imprisoned souls, Betsy used her telepathy to destroy Sapphire from within, and emerged in her original body. She later explained to Jubilee that after Sapphire was destroyed, she was able to use the soul energy she left behind to re-create her original body. It was also shown that Kwannon has apparently returned to life in her original body as well, as the new Psylocke.

===Disassembled and Age of X-Man===

Immediately after reclaiming her original body and legal identity as Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock, Betsy returned to the Xavier Institute, where Jean Grey helped her cope with such a major change. Betsy also traveled to England and reunited with Brian and Meggan and met her niece, Maggie. The following days saw the X-Men responding to unexplained natural phenomena across the globe. The X-Men soon found out Nate Grey was responsible for these disasters in a desperate attempt to enact world peace and remake the world as he saw fit with the help of his Horsemen of Salvation, which included Angel. Betsy engaged Angel head-on and used a massive psychic strike to free Warren from Nate Grey&#x27;s control, which unintentionally released his Archangel persona. Warren and Betsy had a falling-out, and he blamed her for unleashing the darkness within him. The X-Men responded with force, but were quickly overpowered and subdued. Betsy broke Nate Grey&#x27;s control over Storm and soon joined forces with Jean Grey and other psychics to defeat X-Man once and for all, but the X-Men were all seemingly killed.

Gone from the Prime Marvel Universe, the X-Men were taken to a plane of existence created by X-Man with false memories, where everyone was a mutant and close relationships and love were forbidden. In this world, Betsy acted as a law enforcer for Department X alongside Iceman, Jubilee, Northstar and Blob, with whom she developed a special friendship. As the Age of X-Man crumbled down, Betsy returned to Earth-616, where she joined Cyclops and his X-Men to end the threat of Colonel Callahan once and for all.

===Dawn of X and return as Captain Britain===
In the following six months, Professor X established the island-nation of Krakoa, welcoming mutants from all over the world and creating the first mutant society. Betsy had returned to her ancestral home in England, now known as Braddock Academy, but ultimately decided to move to Krakoa as well, only to find that her elder brother, Jamie Braddock, had been resurrected. Apocalypse also enlisted Betsy and Brian to investigate a strange, magically sealed Krakoan gate that opened from the Otherworld to the mutant-island. Morgan Le Fay, acting as Queen Regent of Otherworld and enraged about mutantkind&#x27;s reach on her realm, cursed Brian to become her dark champion. In a desperate attempt to save his sister, Brian gave Betsy his Amulet of Right, the source of his powers. As a result, Betsy once again became Captain Britain, a hero of legend. Betsy was then chosen as one of the ten warriors who fight for Krakoa during the X of Swords tournament. She was defeated in the first round by Isca the Unbeaten and shattered like glass.

==Characterization==
===Early powers===
In her earliest appearances in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, Betsy possessed the power of telepathy. She could read and project thoughts over long distances; control minds; manipulate people&#x27;s minds and possess them; subdue and tap into other&#x27;s powers; affect people&#x27;s memories; project mental illusions; and generate psi-bolts that could stun, injure, or kill others. She could also project her astral self, and the astral bodies of other people, into the astral or physical plane. She could scan entire towns with her mind, and leaf through the psyches of the inhabitants of a city to learn of their condition or intentions. She was powerful enough to telepathically &quot;shout&quot; to her teammates in Australia while she was in Washington, D.C. without the aid of any type of power-enhancing machinery such as Cerebro. She could also probe individuals to check up on their status.

When using her telepathic powers, a butterfly-shaped energy aura would appear around her face. It was never truly made clear in the comic books by the writers whether this was something that could be perceived by others or if this was simply an &quot;effect&quot; to show when Betsy was using her powers to the reading audience (although it was implied that it could be). This &quot;butterfly&quot; (sometimes depicted as having eyes in its wings) was also the form Betsy usually took when manifesting her astral form, both on the astral plane, and in the physical world, although she occasionally used an illusory image of her physical body. After her transformation, Betsy&#x27;s psi-form changed accordingly.

In addition, Betsy could also use her telepathy to project a focused beam of directed psionic energy called a &quot;psycho-blast&quot; that could incapacitate or kill a living being instantly. This attack was powerful enough to pierce the Juggernaut&#x27;s psi-proof helmet. The psycho-blast was able to affect inorganic material as well as living targets (when directing a psycho-blast at Sabretooth the energy destroyed the metal Cerebro helmet she was wearing). Betsy also possessed limited precognitive powers that occasionally allowed her to envision probable future events, or to see quick flashes of the immediate future. These visions were random and infrequent, however, and she had no control over them.

While in her original body, Betsy was given bionic eyes by Mojo and Spiral which instantly adjusted to any intensity of light, preventing her from being blinded by brightness. The bionic eyes were also cameras, transmitting to Mojo everything that Betsy saw. For a time, Betsy took the role of Captain Britain from her brother, using the deceased Kaptain Briton&#x27;s costume which had been modified by the Mastermind computer. This costume gave her superhuman strength and the ability to fly, and restoring her sight after she was briefly rendered temporarily blind.

===New powers===
After her physical transformation into a Japanese ninja assassin, she gained highly developed fighting skills in addition to her telepathy, which at this stage was not as powerful as it had been before her transformation, as half of her psionic potential still resided with Revanche in her original body. After Revanche&#x27;s death, Betsy&#x27;s telepathy was restored to its previous strength. The most common usage of her powers was the manifestation of a &quot;psychic knife&quot;, which operated in the same manner as her &quot;psycho-blast&quot; ability, but at close range. Described as the focused totality of her psychic powers, she often used it to disrupt the minds and nervous systems of her foes by driving the glowing &quot;blade&quot; of psionic energy into their heads. At least once, she utilized two psychic knives simultaneously. During this time she chose to fight up-close most of the time, using her new martial arts skills, although she could still utilize distanced telepathic assaults. At least once, she experienced a precognitive flash while in her new body.

After her exposure to the Crimson Dawn, she also gained the ability to teleport herself and others using areas of shadow as gateways. The teleportation could cover huge distances; on one occasion she transported the X-Men from America to Africa in a few seconds. She could also teleport through the shadows of other dimensions. Betsy has not been seen using this ability since her imprisonment of the Shadow King in the astral plane; during a mission against Stryfe, she mentioned to Nightcrawler that she no longer possessed this ability.

===Telekinetic powers===
To keep the Shadow King imprisoned in the Astral Plane, Betsy sacrificed the use of her telepathy, but at some point gained Phoenix&#x27;s telekinesis instead. At first, due to the relative newness of her telekinesis, she could not exercise fine control over her powers. She could blast an enemy through a brick wall, but could not levitate small objects, like a dime, from the floor. As time progressed, Betsy grew more proficient at using her powers and she could use her telekinesis to reshape a pistol into smaller metal projectiles.

Instead of her psychic knife, Betsy began to manifest a telekinetic katana composed of raw psionic energy. At its lowest intensity her katana functions much like her psychic knife once did, short-circuiting the victim&#x27;s nervous system on impact. At its highest level, the katana can slice through almost any physical matter. Betsy&#x27;s control over the katana is such that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor, but only leave her opponent stunned or unconscious. Betsy&#x27;s telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world, and so she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness. The katana can also affect beings that are more powerful than Betsy herself. She can also use her sword to shatter telepathic power-inhibitors imposed on others, despite her own lack of telepathy. With no telepathy to guide her when performing this task, she must rely on her instincts to give the blade the sufficient strength necessary to break the inhibitors, without doing permanent damage to the subject in question. During the timeline shift known as House of M, Betsy showed the ability to summon two telekinetic katanas at the same time. It is unknown if she is capable of this under normal circumstances.

Aside from the blade, Betsy can use her telekinesis to enhance her speed, strength, and fighting skills to superhuman levels. She can also levitate herself and others, or manipulate matter on a molecular level. She can also create telekinetic shields of various sizes and strength, and her telekinesis has been said to be strong enough to shatter mountains. After her resurrection, Betsy&#x27;s telekinetic powers have been greatly enhanced. At the time of Betsy&#x27;s resurrection, Marvel Girl claimed that Betsy&#x27;s telekinesis was on a level even she could not match.

After her resurrection, Betsy was shown to be immune to all forms of psionic manipulations such as mind-reading, mind-control or mental attacks, and attempts of telepathic communication. This is a result of her brother Jamie&#x27;s manipulation of the quantum strings that comprise her body. She is also immune or at least highly resistant to other psionic-based powers like the Savage Land Mutate Vertigo&#x27;s disorientation power, or Nocturne&#x27;s mind possessing abilities. Due to Jamie&#x27;s alterations, Betsy is also immune to any physical and mental alteration by beings who can radically restructure reality, such as Proteus. She can, however, still be killed in more traditional manners, such as being stabbed or shot. She is also at least partially resistant to magical manipulation. Somehow these various immunities also affect her detectability from higher order technological equipment. For example, all sensor-arrays of the Exiles Crystal Palace are not able to detect her—as if she does not even exist. Beside this immunity, she is able to use her telekinesis to modify her own molecular structure to render herself invisible to at least the naked eye.

However, Betsy&#x27;s telekinetic powers seems to evolve with the return of her telepathy since her encounter with the Sisterhood as, at first, she has rarely been seen using her telekinesis to levitate objects or create her trademark telekinetic katana. It appears also, that she is focusing more on developing her returned telepathic powers and that the various immunities that were granted to her by her resurrection at the hands of her brother seem to have vanished or at least greatly diminished, as during the Necrosha event Proteus was not only able to possess Betsy but also was able to alter her body structure. During the &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, Betsy has once more been depicted using her telekinesis for considerable feats: such as making a shield to protect herself and X-23 from bullets, ripping a Nimrod robot in two and even achieving what appears to be a form of flight or levitation.

=== Returned powers and abilities ===
The events involving the Sisterhood of Mutants triggered a return of her original telepathic abilities. Upon rejoining the X-Men, Betsy states that while she is still primarily a telekinetic, she has gained the mental ability to telepathically &quot;suggest what people see&quot; (i.e. cast telepathic illusions). In an interview, writer Christopher Yost and editor Daniel Ketchum confirmed that Betsy Braddock now possesses both telekinesis and telepathy. Additionally, she is once again able to focus her telepathic energies into a solid psychic knife and can still manifest her telekinetic katana.

As shown in the events of the &quot;Psylocke&quot; miniseries, she still appears to be an unusually strong and powerful telepath, with a range of abilities similar to what she possessed at her introduction, as well as manifesting her trademark psychic knife. Betsy is also shown to have levels of telekinesis sufficient to increase the strength and power of her physical blows as well as ward off attacks via force fields and telekinetic &quot;blasts or bursts&quot;. During the Utopia storyline, she was seen manifesting her telekinetic katana, but of late she has been seen using a pair of traditional katanas as well. After the events of &quot;Second Coming&quot;, Betsy establishes that her psychic abilities fluctuate in strength; if her concentration is divided as a result of a telepathic response to her environment, it has an adverse effect on her telekinesis.

During the &quot;Dark Angel Saga&quot;, Betsy&#x27;s full psionic potential was unlocked by Jean Grey from the Age of Apocalypse timeline. She was able to overcome Archangel with her newly strengthened and increased telepathy – a feat that had previously been beyond her power. Writer Rick Remender has stated that she is now an Omega-class/level mutant and telepath on par with Jean Grey and Charles Xavier.

===Fighting skills===
Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock has been classified as a master martial artist, though the specific fighting arts she has mastered have never been revealed. Psylocke&#x27;s fighting skills and techniques have been shown to surpass those of the average Hand ninja, or Crimson Dawn Undercloak, and have been said to rival those of a ninja master. In addition to the fighting skills she learned from The Hand, Betsy has recently received training from fellow Exiles teammate Sabretooth and from an alternate reality&#x27;s Ogun, who used science and magic combined to alter the passage of time itself, allowing them to accomplish a lifetime&#x27;s work in a few short hours, thus improving Betsy&#x27;s skills once more.

As a telepath, Betsy could take advantage of her powers in a fight by reading her opponents&#x27; movements seconds before they made them, giving her the opportunity to counter-attack faster. She could also use her telepathy to mask her presence from other people, humans and superhumans alike, e.g. from Wolverine&#x27;s super-enhanced senses or from Jean Grey&#x27;s telepathy. She could also create telepathic illusions to distract her enemies while fighting them, and as a ninja, she can use her psychic knife to incapacitate her opponents instead of killing them; although she will kill her opponents if she finds it to be necessary.

As a telekinetic, she often uses her powers to augment her strength and speed, making her fighting skills strong enough to match, and even outmatch other superhumanly strong opponents, like a holographic version of Sabretooth in the Danger Room. During a training session with Rogue and Thunderbird, Betsy was able to match Rogue&#x27;s attacks despite the fact that Rogue had greatly enhanced speed and strength at the time.

===Armor===
During the time when the X-Men were based in the Australian outback, Betsy Braddock gained possession of a unique suit of armor. Made of an unknown metal, it was lightweight and form-fitting, yet extremely resistant to physical damage, giving Betsy an added protection to her physical body. The armor was also resistant to projectiles and energy weapons. Wolverine had the armor custom-ordered through a weapons and technology firm named Landau, Luckman, and Lake for &quot;a colleague&quot;. Mr. Chang, an agent of Landau, Luckman, and Lake, loaned the armor to Lindsay McCabe since Wolverine had sent her to him. Tyger Tiger also wore the body armor for a short time, and she was briefly trapped in the armor due to a built-in security mechanism, which Wolverine managed to free her from. After traveling through the Siege Perilous and trading bodies with Kwannon, Betsy no longer used the body armor. When Kwannon, in Betsy&#x27;s original body, returned to Xavier&#x27;s mansion, she was wearing an armor that was similar to the one Betsy used to wear, but it has never been officially stated whether or not this armor had the same capabilities as Betsy&#x27;s original one. The same can be said for the armor worn by Betsy&#x27;s resurrected original body, after it was brought back during by Madelyne&#x27;s sisterhood, wearing armor of the same coloring.

===Relationships===
Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock has been involved in a series of romantic relationships during the years. As a member of S.T.R.I.K.E.&#x27;s Psi Division, she was involved with fellow agent Tom Lennox. He was murdered while trying to defend her, during which time she was telepathically linked to him. Telepathically experiencing Lennox&#x27;s death left Betsy traumatized for a time.

After returning to the X-Men in Kwannon&#x27;s body, Betsy telepathically manipulated Cyclops, her team leader, into being romantically attracted to her. After regaining her full personality from Kwannon, Betsy offered a belated apology to Jean Grey, admitting that the flirtation was due to the presence of Kwannon&#x27;s lingering personality traits in her mind, but that she did in fact find Cyclops attractive. Later, Betsy and Archangel had a romantic relationship, but chose to end it after realizing that the differences between them were too great. After Betsy&#x27;s death, Archangel felt anguish from being unable to save her, but eventually made peace with it and moved on to a relationship with Paige Guthrie.

Betsy and the X-Man Neal Shaara were romantically involved until her death. After joining the Exiles, Betsy has been flirting with teammate Sabretooth. They passionately kissed each other, eventually leading to both acting on their romantic feelings more intimately. Some time later, Betsy and Archangel have been seen to be in the process of rebuilding their romantic relationship. Betsy later had a brief romantic and sexual relationship with both Fantomex and his female counterpart Cluster, after Fantomex was separated into three people.

Betsy was confirmed to be in a romantic relationship with Rachel Summers during their quest for the Siege Perilous in Otherworld.

==Other versions==
In addition to her mainstream incarnation (known as the Earth-616 Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock), the character has had been depicted in the comics set in many other fictional universes and timelines of the Marvel Multiverse, including Age of Apocalypse, Days of Future Past, Earth X, House of M, Marvel Comics 2, Ultimate X-Men, and Age of X. These alternative representations usually differ considerably from the details and events of the main story, without affecting that story&#x27;s narrative continuity.

===Age of Apocalypse===
The &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; (Earth-295) incarnation of Betsy Braddock was created by Akira Yoshida and Chris Bachalo. She is an Asian ninja (wearing a mask), though no explanation is given as to the circumstances of her ethnicity. She possesses the ability to generate psychic blades (an ability that the Earth-616 Betsy Braddock only manifested after switching bodies with Kwannon) that can affect physical matter as well as living beings. She frees the captured X-Men and has a brief reunion with Logan, for whom she bears an obvious grudge. Betsy later battles Dagger, defeating her quickly, and uses her psychic blades to counteract the brainwashing of some of the X-Men; first on Jean, who is released from Mr. Sinister&#x27;s influence, and then on Kirika, which allows the young mutant to remember that Logan and Mariko Yashida are her parents. At the end of the series, Betsy and the other Japanese members of the X-Men (Sunfire, Kirika, and Silver Samurai) depart for Clan Yashida&#x27;s refugee colony in New Japan.

===Age of X===
In &quot;Age of X&quot; (Earth-11326) storyline of &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;, Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock, created by Mike Carey and Clay Mann, is still in her original Caucasian body, having never switched with Kwannon. She is depicted as a member of the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X on a daily basis. Prior to the mutant/human conflict she lived a privileged life among the upper class of British society, similar to her Earth-616 counterpart. Along with others (such as Megan Gwynn and Jonothon Starsmore &quot;Chamber&quot;) was part of a general expulsion of X-Gene positive families from the United Kingdom. The plan was to exile them on a series of small islands in the Irish Sea, but was foiled when the Irish separatists bombed one of the ships carrying the transportees. The Mutant Liberation Front seized control of the other ship (with Chamber on board) and was ultimately able to berth it at the Canadian port of Saguenay. As a member of the Force Warriors, Betsy used her telekinesis in concert with the other members to rebuild the walls around Fortress X every evening in preparation for the next morning&#x27;s attacks. She is in a relationship with the Age of X version of Iceman.

===Days of Future Past===
The dystopian &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; (Earth-811) version of Betsy Braddock was created by John Francis Moore and Joe Bennett. Betsy has not only the Crimson Dawn tattoo over her left eye, but also additional tattoos on the right part of her face. Betsy is first seen as a mysterious hooded female that sneaks up undetected behind Logan and telepathically destroys his consciousness. She is the new Red Queen and one of the Lords Cardinal of the new Hellfire Club. Betsy is seen by Shinobi Shaw&#x27;s side as they watch the trapped Scarlet Witch. As Shinobi brags about world domination, Betsy reminds him that without her help he would not have been so lucky and he tells her that her name is never far away from his thoughts and that they will rule the world side by side. Suddenly, Betsy cries out in pain and says that Wolverine has reawakened and that Emma Frost is responsible for bringing him back. She summons the female ninja Midnight (Amiko Kobayashi) and instructs her to kill Wolverine, in spite of their past together. Baron Zemo makes his way back to Shinobi and Elizabeth to celebrate their victory, just as Magneto makes his way into their base. Betsy senses betrayal from one of the workers, whom she stuns with her psychic knife and find out to be Jubilee in disguise. As she is preparing to kill Jubilee, Synch and Leech use their combined powers against Betsy to intervene. Wolverine finally knocks her down with one punch, commenting that during the years she has grown a bit &quot;rusty&quot; with her martial arts skills. She is taken back to Emma Frost&#x27;s base of operation and Emma later tells Jubilee and the rest of the team that Betsy will be transferred back to her brother in England as soon as her recuperation is completed.

In &quot;Excalibur&quot;, the Earth-9620 Betsy Braddock has no tattoos at all and her eyes are completely blue, with no visible iris or pupils. One thing that connects these two storylines with each other and with the original &quot;Days of Future Past,&quot; is the death of Warren Worthington (Angel). Betsy is a member of the underground resistance against Black Air, the security service that rules Britain. She is first seen as part of the Excalibur team that goes on a mission to rescue Douglock from the Black Air headquarters. Inside the Black Air HQ, Betsy fights off techno-organic Brood replicas and uses her psychic knife to open up a neural linked brain-lock. Inside the locked room, she finds herself trapped together with the rest of the team. What happens to her afterwards is unknown. This story, &quot;Days of Future Tense,&quot; revealed the final fate of the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline&#x27;s Excalibur team.

===Exiles===
Several versions of the character appear in the &quot;Exiles&quot; comics:

*Earth-1081: This Betsy Braddock, created by Judd Winick and Mike McKone, is a member of the X-Men and appears to be identical to the one from Earth-616.
*Earth-2182: A minor character who is an X-Men affiliate with all-blue colored costume, hair and powers, created by Jim Calafiore.
*Earth-7794: A minor character who was murdered by Slaymaster; created by Chris Claremont and Paul Pelletie.
*Earth-51489: A barbarian female warrior killed by Slaymaster; created by Chris Claremont and Paco Diaz Luque.
*Earth-72911: Created by Chris Claremont, she was another Betsy Braddock murdered by Slaymaster.
*Earth-80827: Created by Chris Claremont and Tom Grummett, this version of Betsy Braddock was a Japanese woman affiliated with Ogun and known as Lady Mandarin, who was also killed by Slaymaster when they fought.
*Earth-80911: Married to Victor Creed and murdered by Slaymaster along with her husband and children; created by Chris Claremont and Paco Diaz Luque.
*Earth-89145: In this reality, Braddock was a British pilot, who was murdered by Slaymaster as part of his attempt to kill every version of Betsy Braddock throughout the Multiverse; created by Chris Claremont and Paco Diaz Luque.

===Earth X===
It is unknown if the Betsy Braddock version of the &quot;Earth-X&quot; (Earth-9997) future timeline ever switched bodies with the Japanese assassin Kwannon or if the effect was undone somehow, but she was entirely European when she was brought to Otherworld to further hone her telepathic and precognitive powers under Merlyn and Roma&#x27;s tutelage. Her abilities boosted, Betsy Braddock&#x27;s telepathic signature, the butterfly image, was much bigger than before and constantly &quot;on,&quot; bathing her head in bright, pink light. Her training completed, she rejoined her brother, King Britain, on Earth at some later point, as she, Merlyn and Doctor Strange used their powers to weaken Mephisto, allowing Brian to kill him.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In the alternate reality of the 2005&quot;House of M&quot; storyline (Earth-58163) created by the Scarlet Witch, Betsy found herself as Princess Royal named Elizabeth Glorianna Braddock, sister to the monarch of Britain. In fact, Betsy was actually the rightful heir of the throne, being a few minutes older than her twin brother Brian, but she had stepped down in his favor, as she preferred traveling and adventuring with her lady-in-waiting, Rachel Summers. Nevertheless, she still had an Asian body, and possessed the same powers as the Earth-616 Betsy Braddock.

===MC2===
Although not seen on-panel, Betsy Braddock&#x27;s counterpart of the Marvel Comics 2 universe (Earth-982) was at least mentioned. Apparently, this Betsy acted as a godmother to Wild Thing, the daughter of Wolverine and Elektra, and she also trained her in the use of her psychic powers. Wild Thing had no real claws but psionic ones that she could use in similar ways to Betsy&#x27;s psychic katana.

===Millennial Visions===
Several versions of the character appear in the &quot;X-Men: Millennial Visions&quot; comics:

*Earth-1003: Created by John Paul Leon, Betsy Braddock is good character affiliated with the X-Men and a member of Professor&#x27;s Secret Service. She, Magneto and Quicksilver are all murdered at a peace summit.
*Earth-1011: Created by Sean Chen, Betsy Braddock is an evil cyborg affiliated with the X-Sentinels.
*Earth-1017: Created by Pablo Raimondi, Betsy Braddock (Code X 11095) is an Asian ninja affiliated with the X-Men, with short spiky hair and a different red tattoo over her left eye.
*Earth-3933: Betsy Braddock was bitten by a monster which ate her family in their sleep, and is empowered with super human strength and makes her virtually immortal, though she now hungers for human flesh.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the World Tour story arc of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; (Earth-1610), Agent Betsy Braddock was created by Mark Millar and Adam Kubert. She was introduced as a colonel for the British Secret Intelligence Service along with her partner Agent Dai Thomas. As in the mainstream Marvel Universe, Betsy is the twin sister of Brian Braddock, who is now a member of the European Defense Initiative (the European Union&#x27;s equivalent of the Ultimates), code named Captain Britain. Her father, Professor Sir James Braddock, is still alive in the Ultimate universe, and oversees the EDI&#x27;s super-soldier program. She is a telepath and, judging by her own assertion, the most powerful in England. The &quot;psychoblast&quot; power she possessed in her British form in the Earth-616 universe was manifested as a &quot;psychic grenade&quot; that she &quot;detonated&quot; in the minds of others. Agents Betsy Braddock and Dai Thomas, were assigned to aid Xavier in his search for his son, David, a powerful mutant who could physically possess the bodies of others and manipulate reality. During the investigation, however, Agent Thomas was killed and Betsy&#x27;s body was possessed by David, who set about wreaking havoc and killing innocent humans while in her body. She eventually managed to resist his control, albeit briefly, and pleaded with Xavier to kill her. Xavier could not bring himself to do so, but Colossus dropped a car on her, killing both Betsy and David Xavier.

Betsy&#x27;s consciousness survived, however, somehow moving into the comatose body of a Japanese girl called Kwannon. Kwannon was glad to be able to move on to the afterlife, and willingly gave Betsy her body. Betsy regarded her near-death experience as intensely fascinating. The change has also led her to bear a less formal look, as she was seen after her body-switch with a number of cosmetic piercings. She somehow retained her telepathic powers in Kwannon&#x27;s body and even gained the new ability to create a blade that can cut through most materials, even a Sentinel. She was said to be aiding in the formation of S.T.R.I.K.E., the British division of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later, though, she was revealed to have been working undercover for Charles Xavier as a spy investigating the activities of Fenris.

Betsy officially joined the X-Men under the codename Psylocke. Her employment with S.T.R.I.K.E. had ended because the body she currently inhabits is that of a minor, making her too young to serve as a government agent. She was recruited by Bishop into his new X-Men after angrily informing Cyclops that he had turned his back on the X-Men and the good they can achieve after he refused to help a group of mutants being attacked by Sentinels solely because he thought it would make the Xavier Institute look bad. Bishop later referred to Betsy as his wife, when the Fenris twins threatened to kill her. Betsy confronted Bishop about his comments about their future marriage, and from what he says, it is implied that Betsy was killed before Bishop traveled back in time. Eventually, Bishop is stabbed and killed by Wolverine.

Xavier returns from the future revealing himself to be alive and Betsy begins living at the Xavier Institute as a student. She is seen again after the Ultimatum wave hits New York. While the main X-Men go after Magneto, she stays at the institute. When Reverend William Stryker attacks the school planning to kill every student, Betsy uses Cerebro to send a telepathic message to any mutant that can help save them. Ultimately, she survives the school massacre alongside Rogue, Toad, and Firestar, though, for some reason, she and Toad are listed among the deceased in the final issue of Ultimatum.

Subsequently, a young woman appears claiming to be Betsy Braddock, having &quot;jumped&quot; her consciousness into another body before her death (however, oddly no one recognizes or remembers her). She sides with Mach Two (Nomi Blume) to leave Reservation X, which was given to Kitty Pryde by President Captain America after the fight with the Sentinel, though Kitty wins the vote to stay as the leader of Reservation X. She was then seen manipulating Rogue by using telepathy while she is sleeping, teasing her about Quentin Quire. She eventually leaves with Nomi after the Seed is &quot;destroyed&quot;. It is revealed that she has enlisted Warpath (who is in love with her) to betray both Kitty and Nomi. Jean Grey (herself in disguise) unmasked this Betsy as being a fake, revealed her to be Mothervine, who set out to destroy both Utopia and Tian.

===Uncanny X-Force===
Several versions of the character appear in the &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; comics:

*Earth-11045: In this reality, all superhumans were converted into the cyborgs Deathloks and were converted into a global police force for a global utopia. Betsy Braddock was among them and was sent to the past together with the rest of X-Force to secure a high-tech, self-contained research facility known as The World and kill X-Force of the past.
*The Earth-12928 version of Elizabeth Braddock, an elderly woman known as Magistrate Braddock, was created by Rick Remender and Julian Totino Tedesco. In this reality, Evan Sabah Nur ascended and became Apocalypse, the greatest threat the Earth had ever faced, which forced Wolverine to create an X-Force composed of various heroes. Together, they managed to defeat Evan and save the world. To prevent someone like Evan from threatening the Earth again, X-Force were elected as the new rulers of Earth. Elizabeth, in her Asian body, became the leader of X-Force and the world. They first killed every villain and criminal, and then began killing people preemptively, as soon as they made up their minds to commit a crime. At some point Elizabeth and Logan fell in love. When X-Force from the past came to the future, Elizabeth ordered X-Force to track them down and send them back. The past Elizabeth, horrified with the future, decided to kill herself to prevent it from happening. Magistrate Braddock began fading from existence, but the past Elizabeth was saved, which prevented her death. Magistrate Braddock spoke to her past self, talking mostly about their loss of Warren and Fantomex, before sending her and the rest of X-Force back to the present.

===What If===
Several versions of the character appear in the &quot;What If&quot; comics:

*Earth-957: Appears to be basically the same as the Earth-616 ninja Betsy Braddock in Kwannon&#x27;s body; created by Tom DeFalco and Leo Fernandez.
*Earth-983: Created by Stefan Petrucha and Greg Luzniak, this version of Betsy Braddock is very similar to the Earth-616 ninja Betsy Braddock in Kwannon&#x27;s body, but with a modified costume.
*Earth-34922: When the X-Men were attacked by Sentinels, Betsy Braddock (postbody swap), along with the other members, reluctantly attempts to wake up Wolverine to battle them.
*Earth-77995: Created by Benny Powell and Warren Ellis, this Betsy Braddock is an evil version the Earth-616 ninja Betsy Braddock from &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;. Three months after the deaths of Charles Xavier and Apocalypse, Betsy Braddock joined the Followers of Apocalypse after they were nearly destroyed by Phoenix.
*Earth-89721: An armored and cloaked version of Elizabeth Braddock in her original body, created by Roy Thomas and Ron Wilson. Due to the Evolutionary Bomb she is now able to read the thoughts of everybody around her.
*Earth-95169: This Elizabeth Braddock appears to share her body, power and costume with the Earth-616 &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; version.
*Earth-98193: Captain Britain is briefly seen in an interview with Vulcan as a member of the X-Men. This version of Elizabeth Braddock appears to still be in her blonde, British body.

Betsy Braddock of Earth-21993 was created by Kurt Busiek and Tod Smith. Her history mirrors that of her Earth-616 counterpart until just after she crossed through the Siege Perilous. After Charles Xavier escaped Skrull activity and returned to Earth, she is among the many teams of X-Men gathered by Xavier, who express his disapproval with the state they had left human/mutant affairs in his absence. This meeting erupts into violence due to an argument between Cable and Xavier over what direction to take. Betsy joins the other X-Men in attempting to incapacitate Cable and the New Mutants, but the New Mutants flee. Following Cable&#x27;s assassination of Xavier, Betsy joins a group of X-Men led by Wolverine in tracking the New Mutants down to their new headquarters, where, as she battle the remaining New Mutants, Wolverine kills Cable. Wolverine then leads his team of X-Men on a mission to slay all their enemies. After killing Mr. Sinister and his Nasty Boys, Betsy has enough with the mindless killings and defects over to another team of X-Men led by Storm. By this point, the U.S. government unleashed the Sentinels in response to Magneto taking over Washington. Betsy comes across Storm just as most of the X-Men on her side either defected over to Magneto, or found themselves killed or captured by the Sentinels. Realizing that current events might lead up to the nightmare future (Earth-811) where mutants have been either enslaved or wiped out by the Sentinels, Storm and Betsy seek to try and talk Magneto into stopping his aggressions. Breaking into the United States Capitol, Betsy and Storm attempt to warn Magneto of the possible apocalyptic future ahead of them, but he scoffs at the idea and attempts to destroy another attacking squad of Sentinels. Mentally detecting that one of them carried a nuclear warhead, Betsy attempts to warn Magneto, but she is too late. The bomb goes off, killing them all.

==Reception==
The character has achieved significant critical praise and popularity following the 1989 redesign. According to UGO, &quot;Basically, Marvel gave a third-rate character a makeover, hence, creating one of the most popular female mutants in &quot;X-Men&quot; history.&quot;

Betsy Braddock was included in &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Battle of the Comic-Book Babes&quot; contest in 2005, winning the first two rounds against Aspen Matthews and then Natsumi and Miyuki, before losing to Emma Frost (the eventual champion of this edition). Betsy, however, emerged victorious from the following year&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Comic-Book Babes&quot; in 2006, winning the consecutive rounds against Deena Pilgrim, Rachel Summers and Black Cat. In the final round, she managed to get almost two-thirds of the votes (64%) when pitted against video gaming&#x27;s female icon Lara Croft. In 2006, &quot;IGN&quot; also rated Betsy Braddock as the 22nd top &quot;X-Men&quot; character, comparing her to Rogue&quot; and calling her &quot;a born leader&quot; whose &quot;abilities make her one of the most potent fighters to ever wear the X&quot;, and also placed her third on their list of top &#x27;X-Babes&#x27; for her being an &quot;Asian gal with incredible body and a British accent&quot;. Marvel themselves declared her their own second most favorite hero of 2011, citing her &quot;tremendous and thankless heroism&quot;. That same year, UGO ranked her ninth of their list of &quot;superhero power upgrades that kicked complete ass&quot; and also featured her among 25 &quot;hot ninja girls&quot; and called her an &quot;eye candy that&#x27;s less lollipop and more atomic warhead&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;IGN&quot; included Betsy Braddock among the eight mutants &quot;IGN&quot; wished to see in the sequel to &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, stating that &quot;mentally, she can go toe-to-toe with fellow telepaths like Emma Frost, and physically, she can kick as much ass as Wolverine when the situation calls for it&quot;, and adding that they would prefer to see her appearing as an Asian and a ninja, while disregarding her prior appearances in &quot;X2&quot; and &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;. In 2013, WhatCulture ranked Betsy Braddock as the sixth most underrated &quot;X-Men&quot; character, and included her on the lists of ten mutants they would like to see in the film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; and in the future sequels. In 2014, WhatCulture also included her among the ten female superheroes who deserve their own film spin-off, opining she should be played by Zhang Ziyi. &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; writer and producer Simon Kinberg said Betsy Braddock is a favourite of his, and said the director and producer Bryan Singer &quot;thinks she&#x27;s a neat character so there&#x27;s certainly a chance she&#x27;ll be in an &quot;X-Men&quot; movie some day&quot;. In 2015, Olivia Munn was cast as Betsy Braddock / Psylocke in Singer&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;, which was released the following year.

Some of the praise was directed especially for her many video game roles, including in a series of 2D fighting games by Capcom wherein she was noted as a particularly well animated character. In 1996, &quot;MAXIMUM&quot; reported Betsy Braddock as being possibly the most popular &quot;X-Men&quot; character in Japan, where Capcom games have introduced the franchise to general public, &quot;due to her Japanese appearance...and ninja-esque martial arts moves&quot;. Betsy Braddock was chosen as one of the 20 &quot;muses&quot; of video games by Brazilian magazine &quot;SuperGamePower&quot; in 2001. In the 2009 Marvel poll asking who is the better fighter in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot;, Betsy Braddock got over two-thirds of the votes (68%) against the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series icon and the fighting game genre female symbol Chun-Li. UGO ranked her as fifth on their 2011 list of fighting games&#x27; finest female fighters for her appearances in Capcom titles, stating that &quot;the only thing more confusing than Psylocke&#x27;s backstory is what exactly her powers are [but] all you really need to know is this: Psylocke is a sexy Asian lady ninja sporting the most obscene butt-floss this side of Linda Kozlowski in &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot; included her in their 2012 list of the most humiliating victory quotes in fighting games. 

* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Psylocke 22nd in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Psylocke 4th in their &quot;X-Force: 20 Powerful Members&quot; list.

<text>Litvínov (; ) is a town in Most District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 23,000 inhabitants. It is known as an industrial centre.

==Administrative division==
Litvínov consists of 12 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Dolní Litvínov (43)
*Horní Litvínov (15,058)
*Chudeřín (1,356)
*Hamr (1,867)
*Horní Ves (22)
*Janov (3,795)
*Křížatky (47)
*Lounice (25)
*Písečná (16)
*Růžodol (0)
*Šumná (148)
*Záluží (11)
==Etymology==
The initial name of the settlement was Lutvínov (in old Czech written as &quot;Lutwinow&quot;). It was derived from the personal name Lutvín, meaning &quot;Lutvín&#x27;s (court)&quot;. The German name Liutwin, from which the name Lutvín was derived, is made up of Old High German words &quot;liut&quot; (&#x27;people&#x27;) and &quot;wini&quot; (&#x27;friend&#x27;).

==History==

The first written mention is from 1352. Originally there were two settlements – Horní Litvínov and Dolní Litvínov. In 1715, Count Jan Josef Valdštejn founded a large cloth factory, one of the first in the Czech lands.

Litvínov was promoted to a town on 5 October 1852. In the 19th century, the industrialization of Litvínov deepened. Many new factories were established. Toys and wooden goods were made here, cotton was processed. The mining of lignite, which persists to this day, began, and after a new part of the railway was put into operation in 1870, other coal mines were opened. In a short time, a total of 19 mines were built. Employment opportunities attracted many new residents.

As a result of the global economic crisis in the 1930s, the largely industrial Litvínov was also severely affected. Production was limited in factories or was completely stopped, and the mines were also affected.

In 1939, a large oil refinery was founded south of the town.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The largest oil refinery in the Czech Republic (owned by Orlen Unipetrol) is located there.

==Transport==
In addition to buses, trams also provide public transport. The town operates a transport company together with the neighbouring city of Most.

The I/27 road (the section from Most to Dubí) runs through the town.

There are two train stations in Litvínov. The station named &quot;Litvínov&quot; is the terminus and start of a line to Ústí nad Labem. The station named &quot;Litvínov město&quot; is located on the line Rakovník–Osek.

==Sport==
Lítvínov is a traditional centre of ice hockey. Local club HC Litvínov is a stable part of the top national league (Extraliga) since 1959. Many famous ice hockey players and coaches are connected with HC Litvínov, including 1998 Olympic gold medalists Ivan Hlinka, Vladimír Růžička, Jiří Šlégr, Robert Reichel and Martin Ručinský.

==Sights==
Church of Saint Michael is the oldest and most important state-protected monument of Litvínov. It was built in 1685–1694 in the early Baroque style. The church has been renovated many times, for the first time in 1763. During the major renovation, which took place between 1887 and 1902, the interior was significantly beautified.

Waldstein&#x27;s Castle (also called Litvínov Castle) serves today social and cultural purposes. It was rebuilt into the form of today&#x27;s Baroque chateau in 1732–1743 by the architect František Maxmilián Kaňka. After the abolition of the castle garden, an English-style castle park with an area of was established in 1878. From the end of the 19th century, the castle was used for economic purposes, and since 1964 a museum has been established here.

Osada, local part of Horní Litvínov, is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone. It includes a uniform and high-quality urban area with apartment buildings built by the occupation authorities during World War II for employees of the chemical factory in Záluží.

==Notable people==
*Květoslav Minařík (1908–1974), yogi and mystic 
*Milan Šťovíček (born 1958), politician and mayor of Litvínov in 2006–2009 and 2010–2014
*Josef Beránek (born 1969), ice hockey player and coach

<doc id="644406" wikidata="Q27075634" url="?curid=644406" title="Indian robin">
<text>The Indian robin (Copsychus fulicatus) is a species of passarine bird in the family Muscicapidae. It is widespread in the Indian subcontinent and ranges across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The males of the northern subspecies have brown backs whose extent gradually reduces southwards, with the males of the southern subspecies having all-black backs. They are commonly found in open scrub areas and often seen running along the ground or perching on low thorny shrubs and rocks. The long tail is usually held up and the chestnut undertail coverts and dark body make them easily distinguishable from pied bushchats and Oriental magpie-robins.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Indian robin in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in the Philippines. He used the French name &quot;Le grand traquet des Philippines&quot; and the Latin &quot;Rubetra Philippensis Major&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the 12th edition in 1766, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Indian robin. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla fulicata&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The type location was subsequently corrected to Puducherry in southern India. The specific name is from the Latin &quot;fulicatus&quot; for &quot;dusky&quot; or &quot;black&quot;.

The Indian robin was formerly placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Saxicoloides&quot;. It was moved to &quot;Copsychus&quot; based on the results of molecular phylogenetic studies of birds in the family Muscicapidae.

==Description==
The Indian robin is sexually dimorphic in plumage, with the male being mainly black with a white shoulder patch or stripe whose visible extent can vary with posture. The northern populations have the upper plumage brownish, while the southern populations are black above. The males have chestnut undertail coverts and these are visible as the bird usually holds the 6–8 cm long tail raised upright. The females are brownish above, have no white shoulder stripe and are greyish below, with the vent a paler shade of chestnut than the males. Birds of the northern populations are larger than those from southern India or Sri Lanka. Juvenile birds are much like females, but the throat is mottled.

Several subspecies are named based on their plumage differences. The nominate subspecies refers to the population found across southern peninsular India. The subspecies &quot;leucopterus&quot; is found in Sri Lanka. In the two subspecies &quot;cambaiensis&quot; of northern and north-western India and &quot;erythrura&quot; (=&quot;erythrurus&quot;) of north-eastern India (south to around Sambalpur), the males have brown backs. The subspecies &quot;intermedius&quot; includes birds in appearance between &quot;cambaiensis&quot;, &quot;erythrura&quot; and &quot;fulicata&quot;, the last one found in central India and parts of the Deccan region. The subspecies &quot;munda&quot; was named based on a specimen from the Punjab, but it is now considered synonymous with &quot;cambaiensis&quot;. Older classifications treat the population in southern India as the subspecies &quot;ptymatura&quot; while considering the type locality as Sri Lanka, although it has subsequently been restricted to Pondicherry.

Local names recorded by Jerdon include &quot;Nalanchi&quot; (Telugu), &quot;Wannatikuruvi&quot; (Tamil, &quot;Washerman bird&quot;), &quot;Dayaal&quot; (Marathi) &quot;Kalchuri&quot; (Hindi) and &quot;Paan kiriththaa&quot; (Sinhala). The former genus name indicates that it looks similar to &quot;Saxicola&quot;, the genus of the pied bushchat, a bird often found in similar habitats.

==Distribution and habitat==

This bird is found in open stony, grassy and scrub forest habitats. They are mainly found in dry habitats and are mostly absent from the thicker forest regions and high rainfall areas. All populations are resident and non-migratory. The species is often found close to human habitation and will frequently perch on rooftops.

The species was introduced into the New York region, but did not become established there. A vagrant or escape has been noted from the Maldives.

==Ecology==
Population densities of 193-240 individuals per square km have been estimated in the Pondicherry University campus. The ratio of males to females was about 1.5:1. Territory size for males is estimated at about 6650 m2. Males can be aggressive to others during the breeding season and will even attack reflections. Human activities such as felling and firewood removal in forests appear to benefit them.

===Food===
They feed mostly on insects but are known to take frogs and lizards especially when feeding young at the nest. Individuals may forage late in the evening to capture insects attracted to lights.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is December to September, but varies according to region and usually begins with the first rains. Peak breeding in northern India is in June and is earlier in Southern India. In Sri Lanka, breeding is in March to June and August to September. Males sing during this season and display by lowering and spreading their tail feathers and strutting around the female, displaying their sides and fluffing their undertail coverts. The songs of males have variants for inviting mates and for deterring other males. Males will drive away other males and patrol their territory by flying with slow wing beats from perch to perch. They may sometimes peck at their reflections. An aggressive display involves fluffing up the feathers and holding the bill high.

Nests are built between rocks, in holes in walls or in a tree hollow and are lined with animal hair. It has been noted that many of them are also lined with pieces of snakeskin sloughs. The eggs are of regular oval form, but many are elongated and a few pointed. They have a fair amount of gloss. The ground colour is white, often tinged with faint green or pink which is rather closely spotted, speckled, streaked, or mottled with rich reddish- or umber-brown and brownish-yellow with some underlying lavender. The markings are denser at the larger end of the egg, where they form an irregular cap. Some eggs are blotched with dark reddish-brown at the large end. They are about long and wide. Three to four eggs is the usual clutch. An abnormal clutch of seven has been noted, although none of the eggs hatched at this nest. Only the female incubates the eggs, which then hatch in about 10–12 days. The chicks have black down. Both males and females feed the young, the male sometimes passing food to the female who, in turn, feeds the young. Nestlings may feign dead (thanatosis) when handled and may be preyed on by the rufous treepie. The same nest site may be reused in subsequent years.

An old anecdotal record of these birds laying their eggs in the nests of &quot;Turdoides&quot; babblers has not been supported by later observers. Laboratory studies have demonstrated cyclic changes in the melanin pigmentation of the tissue surrounding the testes. The dark pigmentation is lost during the breeding season and regained later.

===Parasites===

Several parasites, including a cestode, have been identified in this species.

<doc id="644409" wikidata="Q5735253" url="?curid=644409" title="Herbert Philbrick">
<text>Herbert Arthur Philbrick (May 11, 1915 – August 16, 1993) was a Boston-area advertising executive who was encouraged by the FBI to infiltrate the Communist Party USA between 1940 and 1949. His autobiography was the basis for the 1950s television series &quot;I Led 3 Lives&quot;.

==Communist Party involvement==
Philbrick&#x27;s involvement began when he joined the Cambridge Youth Council, a Communist front group in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His suspicions aroused by the strange power structure and the positions taken by this group, Philbrick contacted the FBI. Encouraged by them, he began deepening his involvement in Communist activities, joining first the Young Communist League, and later, as a secret member, the Communist Party itself.

Philbrick was used by the Party for his advertising skills. Another asset was his public role as a Baptist youth leader. After time spent in local party cells in Wakefield and Malden, Massachusetts, he received training in the fundamentals of Marxism–Leninism and worked for the Party in a variety of front groups. Later he was removed from local party work and assigned to a cell of professionals where his main work consisted of working on the 1948 Progressive Party presidential campaign of former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace.

During Philbrick&#x27;s time in the Communist Party, its membership and support were eroded by the Party&#x27;s sharp zigzag from anti-war agitation during the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, to enthusiastic support for the war effort after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.

While Philbrick was in the Party, Earl Browder, its General Secretary, who was enthusiastic about wartime cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union, and was looking forward to postwar cooperation and growing acceptance of the Communist party by the American public, dissolved the Communist Party and reconstituted it as the Communist Political Association, apparently intending to set the Party on a reformist course. Philbrick himself made a brief show of opposing this new policy—a masterstroke, as the policy was also opposed by William Z. Foster, longtime Chairman of the Communist Party. Shortly thereafter, in July 1945, as a result of the Duclos letter—a letter by a leading French Communist, which actually was a policy directive that originated in Moscow—the Party turned away from Browderism and again took a Marxist–Leninist line, though not completely abandoning the tactics of the united front.

===Foley Square trial===
Philbrick&#x27;s Party career came to its end when the Justice Department decided to use him as a witness in the Smith Act prosecutions of the leadership of the Communist Party, in the Foley Square trial. On April 6, 1949, he was called as a witness, testifying about his career and training as a Party activist. His testimony was perhaps most useful in that he demonstrated from the content of the training which he had received that the intent of the Communist Party was to overthrow the government of the United States. The trial took almost a year, and all 11 defendants were convicted.

Upon appeal, convictions were upheld in 1951 by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;. However, in 1969 &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; &quot;de facto&quot; overruled Dennis. The Court held that the government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is &quot;directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action&quot;.

Philbrick claimed that he was only paid by the FBI for his expenses, but &quot;FBI files show the bureau paid him $6,823 for services and $359.38 for expenses through the trial’s resolution.&quot; Nevertheless, he did turn down several invitations to testify before Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s hearings. He told a reporter for The Boston Globe that &quot;McCarthy harmed the cause of anti-communism more than anybody I know.&quot;

===Book===

He went on to write an autobiographical book, &quot;I Led Three Lives: Citizen, &#x27;Communist&#x27;, Counterspy&quot;. In addition, a television series called &quot;I Led 3 Lives&quot;, starring Richard Carlson and Ed Hinton, loosely based on Philbrick&#x27;s experiences, aired in syndication for three seasons during the 1950s.
He received $141,015 in royalties from the show.

==Later years==
Later in life, Philbrick retired to the home of his youth, in the Little Boar&#x27;s Head district of North Hampton, New Hampshire. He remained active, giving speeches and encouraging youth and adult citizens to exercise their political rights and power, admonishing his listeners to be ever-watchful against those who would undermine the republican form of government. Toward the end of his life, he owned and ran a variety store in Rye Beach, New Hampshire. He claimed that he never stopped traveling under assumed names and watching for people following him.

On August 16, 1993, Philbrick died at his North Hampton home.

Philbrick was father to six children with his first wife Eva: Dale, Brenda, Leslie, Connie, Sandra, and Herbert Jr. He had a daughter, Dawn, with his second wife, Shirley Brundige Philbrick.

Philbrick&#x27;s personal papers were acquired by the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, where they are made available to researchers.

<text>eMusic is an online music and audiobook store that operates by subscription. In exchange for a monthly subscription eMusic users can download a fixed number of MP3 tracks per month. eMusic was established in 1998, is headquartered in New York City with an office in London, and is owned by TriPlay.

== Company ownership history ==
The original eMusic was started in March 1995 by Mark Chasan as the fourth online CD retailer. Originally conceived as an online record retailer, Chasan envisioned the system providing &quot;direct digital delivery of music to homes&quot; at low prices. At the time, Chasan was working on several new audio streaming methods, since existing technology had low sound quality with long download times, and he was working on improving this functionality. Eventually his service was able to sell digital music files online.

In February 1998, Chasan partnered with Nordic Entertainment, owned by Kent Kiefer, to increase the catalogue available to eMusic customers. They became the first digital media retailer and sold the first MP3 players on the internet. Both companies were then acquired by Goodnoise Records, which was owned by Gene Hoffman, Bob Kohn, and Gary Culpepper. They also acquired on-line music pioneer Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA). The combined company continued to be known as eMusic. It went public on Nasdaq in 1999.

eMusic then purchased Guy Giuliano&#x27;s internet radio service GBS Radio Networks. The new consortium launched the first online radio network LoudRadio, to broadcast over a terrestrial radio station via KLOD-FM in Flagstaff, Arizona along with IUMA. In November 1999, eMusic acquired main rival Cductive and in December 1999 acquired Tunes.com, which operated Rollingstone.com and DownBeatJazz.com. Then in 2001, the major label Universal Music (then a division of Vivendi Universal) bought eMusic.com for US$24.6 million.

In November 2003, the service was purchased from VU Net USA by a New York–based private equity arm of JDS Capital Management, Inc. Following a contentious period during which information disseminated by the company was limited, it was relaunched in 2004. Relaunch was soon followed by a new format for the eMusic site, significant increase in both editorial and music content and an eventual price increase for most subscription levels. Commensurate with this relaunch, David B. Pakman became the CEO of the company until leaving in November 2008.

On October 21, 2015, eMusic was acquired by Israeli media startup, TriPlay. The full terms of the deal have yet to be disclosed.

== Features ==
eMusic is a digital music store, founded in 1998 as one of the first sites to sell DRM-free MP3s. The site also features original editorial content and was expanded in March 2014 to include &quot;Wondering Sound&quot;, an online music publication which includes eMusic&#x27;s archived music features, interviews, news, photography, and new long-form articles and interviews.
eMusic&#x27;s music store, as of March 2011, had more than 12 million tracks, up from 9 million tracks in September 2010. New subscribers can take out a seven-day trial before taking a full subscription; the trial account becomes a billable subscription account after seven days. Refunds are possible, under certain circumstances, by contacting eMusic customer support. Subscriptions allow users to download a number of tracks per 30-day period.

eMusic currently offers a number of Membership plans, including Basic, Plus, Premium and Fan in exchange for a monthly fee. Every 30 days the download limit is reset (regardless of how many songs were downloaded). eMusic also offers &quot;booster packs&quot; to subscribers, which expire after 90 days rather than after a month, and are consumed when subscribers download tracks beyond their monthly allotments. Earlier business models prior to Dimensional Associates&#x27; ownership supported an &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; download subscription. For a monthly fee, customers were able to download as many tracks as they wished from the service.

eMusic was one of the first sites to sell music in the MP3 format, beginning in 1998. It differs from other well-known music download services (such as the iTunes Store and Amazon Music) in that it is a download-to-own subscription service. However, in 2011 eMusic took its first, limited step into streaming in an effort to help users discover unfamiliar tracks and artists more easily.

In 2006, eMusic added two European versions of its online store: &#x27;eMusic UK&#x27; and &#x27;eMusic Europe&#x27;. Current subscribers to the global site that were within the European Union had their membership transferred to the appropriate European store. eMusic UK and eMusic Europe have higher prices compared to their North American counterpart, partially due to the extra sales taxes which these stores are now subject to. However, the changeover also included access to labels previously unavailable to non-European customers, notably London-based Domino Records and artists such as The White Stripes and Mogwai. It is also notable that the European version of the store is for customers within the European Union, not customers within Europe.

eMusic&#x27;s early growth may have been due to its early support of the MP3 format, lack of digital rights management (DRM) encoding and low prices; all concepts advocated by the Open Music Model. Devin Leonard of CNN attributed eMusic&#x27;s growth to its being the only online music store aside from iTunes that sold tracks that could be played on an iPod. In 2009, eMusic changed its pricing structure, raising prices for new users and most existing users. The move was unpopular with some, but tracks from the Sony catalogue over two years old were then made available to eMusic customers. Prior to July 2009, eMusic mainly sold music from independent labels.

eMusic shares the revenue with artists who have submitted music via digital distribution service providers such as CD Baby, TuneCore, Nimbit, State 51 and EmuBands. eMusic has not had significant growth in subscribers – maintaining over 400,000 subscribers since 2007.

eMusic was the first digital retailer to sell DRM-free downloadable audiobooks in the MP3 format beginning in 2007. Audible.com, its largest competitor, offers audiobooks with digital rights management in the .aa format.

eMusic launched a Canadian version of its store in 2008.

On July 14, 2016, eMusic launched eStories, an audiobook service that will offer 80,000 titles at a cost of $11.95 per title to use, plus 33 percent off additional purchases.

== File format support ==
Due to the contentious nature of DRM encoding that was initially used by competing download services, eMusic won early praise for not including any in their own files, despite the fact that it cost them contracts with the major record labels. eMusic openly stated that this was a business move that has greatly aided the site&#x27;s popularity. While the site currently sells music from the four major record labels, the company has stated that it will remain true to its independent roots and build new product features that are geared towards members who are independent-minded, not mainstream pop-culturists.

eMusic stores a record of user purchases on its internal servers, but does not place any purchaser information inside the tracks that are sold. The service uses the LAME mp3 encoder to produce variable bit rate MP3 files. Analysis on the files show that the preset used is alt-preset-standard, a high quality VBR preset aiming at an average bit rate around 192 kbit/s. However, and contrary to the information published on the web site, files can sometimes be found in lower quality bit rates, including for recent releases. The preview streams provided for each song match the bit rate quality of the full download files.

==Music catalogue==

eMusic has had contracts with both the independent labels and the four major music labels in the United States. Most of eMusic&#x27;s contracts are with independent labels, giving the service a reputation for primarily offering indie rock, indie pop, heavy metal, punk rock, jazz and classical music. eMusic highlights its offerings through a host of exclusive editorial content, along the lines of monthly &quot;editor&#x27;s picks&quot;, columns and guides.

The site&#x27;s alternative (or &quot;indie&quot;) rock selection has also been aided by the rise in widely distributed but privately owned labels such as Kill Rock Stars and Matador Records, who have a fair amount of big-name talent on their rolls (e.g. Cat Power, The Decemberists, Interpol and Sleater-Kinney, who have been among eMusic&#x27;s top-sellers). Music from other popular indie labels includes Merge Records (Spoon, Arcade Fire, Lambchop), K Records (Modest Mouse, Built to Spill), Touch and Go Records (Mekons, Girls Against Boys), and TVT Records (Lil Jon, Ying Yang Twins, Guided By Voices).

In 1999, eMusic made headlines by releasing &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; by They Might Be Giants, the first internet-only distributed album by a major artist. The band also went on to release a series of monthly, exclusive rarities collections (known as &quot;TMBG Unlimited&quot;) through the service in 2001 and 2002. John Flansburgh said that &quot;Getting a half dozen or dozen unreleased songs out each month provides an ‘ultimate fan club’ experience.&quot;

In 2004, with the change from an unlimited download subscription model to a set-track subscription download model, eMusic increased their catalogue content over the next few years, particularly in the Indian soundtrack and Indian classical genres and in the classical music genre and added such labels as Saregama, Naxos, BIS, Chandos, Harmonia Mundi and Telarc.

In June 2006, eMusic added new music from V2 Records in the U.S. The label is one of eMusic&#x27;s highest-profile additions thus far, with multi-platinum acts Moby and The White Stripes and critical favorites including Grandaddy. However, this music is not available to eMusic users in many other countries and while Moby is still available at present, The White Stripes&#x27; catalog was removed until Warner Bros. was brought on.

In June 2007, eMusic added perhaps its biggest star yet to its lineup: Paul McCartney of The Beatles. His album, &quot;Memory Almost Full&quot;, is also the first release on Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music label.

The eMusicLive Venue Network is 22 independent clubs in the US where live shows are recorded and offered to eMusic subscribers. Numerous shows are recorded every week. In addition to subscription sales, recorded CDs are offered for sale at the venue immediately after the event. eMusic plans to establish kiosks where the music can be delivered directly to MP3 players or flash drives.

Beginning September 18, 2007, eMusic began to offer audiobooks in MP3 format.

On April 2, 2008, eMusic added The Rolling Stones when they were on their ABKCO label. This includes their music from 1964 to 1970, plus any compilations made thereafter by ABKCO. The availability of The Rolling Stones&#x27; catalog ended on May 3, 2008.

On June 1, 2009, eMusic struck a deal with Sony Music Entertainment to sell music released two years ago or earlier.

On January 12, 2010, eMusic struck a deal with Warner Music to sell music from its catalog, including music from the Warner Brothers, Atlantic, and Rhino labels, making them the second of the Big Four to enter an agreement with eMusic.

In November, 2010, eMusic expanded its catalog to include Universal Music. With the massive expansion, eMusic will also introduce a new pricing schedule that will set individual song prices based upon the song&#x27;s popularity. Song credits will no longer be used for subscribers. Instead, eMusic subscribers will be given dollar for dollar credits to spend at the site. The labels Beggars Group, Domino, and Merge will no longer be on eMusic. Merge Records later returned to eMusic in May 2015. In addition, eMusic changed its policy on redownloading so that customers can no longer go to their download history and redownload tracks or albums.

By spring 2011, eMusic had deals with all four major record companies: Universal Music, Warner Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and EMI Music. Its May 2011 agreement with EMI also included the jazz label Blue Note. Despite the expansion of its catalogue, the company claims to maintain strong connections with independent music labels.

At the end of September 2014, eMusic announced on its website that going forward, in a return to its indie music roots it would focus on independent labels, and exit the mainstream music business. The New York Times reported that eMusic had confirmed that it would no longer carry recordings from Sony, Universal and Warner. According to the article, independent musicians and labels often have complicated arrangements with major labels for their music to be distributed, and that an eMusic spokesperson had stated, &quot;the independent labels that use major label distribution resources have been removed from the site.&quot;

In July 2018, The Orchard, a distributor owned by Sony Music, removed its catalogue from the service, stating that eMusic had failed to make payments. Naxos Records and INgrooves have also removed their catalogues for the same reason.

== Executive staff ==
The current management team for eMusic consists of:
* Chief Executive Officer &amp; Chairman – Daniel C. Stein (2003 – December 2014)
* Managing Director Europe – Madeline Milne (April 2006 – April 2013)

== Cductive ==
Cductive was a pioneering online music store founded in 1996 by Tom Ryan, John Rigos, and Alan Manuel. It sold 99 cent mp3 downloads and custom CD compilations from a selection of several hundred independent record labels. In December 1999, the company was acquired by main rival eMusic, and most of Cductive&#x27;s artists and labels are still available via the eMusic service.

<doc id="644418" wikidata="Q646123" url="?curid=644418" title="Mike Babcock">
<text>Mike Babcock (born April 29, 1963) is a Canadian former ice hockey player and coach. He spent parts of eighteen seasons as a head coach in the National Hockey League (NHL), beginning when he was named head coach of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, whom he led to the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals. In 2005, Babcock signed with the Detroit Red Wings, winning the Stanley Cup with them in 2008, and helping them to the Stanley Cup playoffs every year during his tenure and setting a record for most wins in Red Wings history. In 2015, he left Detroit to coach the Toronto Maple Leafs, a position he held until he was fired in 2019. During his coaching tenure from 1991 to 2019, Babcock&#x27;s teams missed the post-season only four times. In 2023, he attempted a return to the NHL with the Columbus Blue Jackets; however, he resigned in disgrace before the beginning of the 2023–24 season amidst investigations into allegations of misconduct.

Babcock also gained extensive experience coaching internationally. As of 2025, he is the only coach to gain entry to the Triple Gold Club, winning the Stanley Cup, IIHF World Championships, and coaching an Olympic gold medal-winning team. He guided the Red Wings to the Stanley Cup in 2008; he coached Team Canada to gold at the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships in 2004; and he coached Canada to gold at both the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Babcock is the only coach to win six distinct national or international titles. He also guided Canada to gold at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the IIHF World Junior Championships in 1997, and he coached the University of Lethbridge to the CIS University Cup in 1994.

Since the end of his tenure with the Maple Leafs, Babcock has been the subject of public criticism from many former players about his professional conduct, including allegations of verbal abuse and mistreatment.

==Education and playing career==

Babcock was born in Manitouwadge, Ontario, and grew up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Babcock played for the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1980–81 and spent a season with the Kelowna Wings in 1982–83. In between, he played a year under Dave King at the University of Saskatchewan, and after Kelowna, he transferred to McGill University to play for coach Ken Tyler. In September 1985, Babcock also attended the Vancouver Canucks NHL training camp, and played one exhibition game with the team.

Babcock graduated from McGill in 1986 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physical education and also did post-graduate work in sports psychology. In 146 career games with the Redmen, he tallied 22 goals and 85 assists for a total of 107 points and 301 penalty minutes, graduating as the second-highest-scoring defenceman in McGill history. Over four seasons from 1983–84 to 1986–87, he was a two-time all-star defenceman, served as captain, and won the Bobby Bell trophy as team MVP. While at McGill, Babcock joined the Tau Alpha chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

After his time at McGill, Babcock moved to the United Kingdom in 1987 as a player-coach for the Whitley Warriors. The team missed out on the league title by two points. In 49 games, he contributed 45 goals and 127 assists and accumulated 123 penalty minutes.

==Coaching career==
Babcock is one of four McGill University players to coach an NHL team, joining Lester Patrick with the New York Rangers, George Burnett with the Edmonton Oilers, and Guy Boucher with the Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators. In 2008, Babcock became the second McGill hockey player to coach a Stanley Cup winner after Patrick.

Babcock has had a distinguished coaching career, coaching continuously from 1987 to 2019, including from 2002 to 2019 in the NHL. When he was fired by the Maple Leafs in 2019, he had amassed an NHL coaching record of 700-418-164-19, with his 700 wins currently placing him 12th all-time in coaching wins, as of 2023.

===College, juniors, and minors (1988–2002)===
Red Deer College

In 1988, Babcock was appointed head coach at Red Deer College in Alberta. He spent three seasons at the school, winning the provincial collegiate championship and earning coach-of-the-year honours in 1989.

Moose Jaw (WHL)

Babcock moved to the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1991, where he guided the Moose Jaw Warriors for a two-year term. Babcock was fired by the team in 1993 after missing the playoffs and nearly left coaching when he accepted a job in business consulting; however, he was then offered the head coaching position at the University of Lethbridge, and decided to accept.

University of Lethbridge (CIS)

Babcock coached the struggling Lethbridge Pronghorns and helped turn the program around. He earned Canada West coach-of-the-year honours in 1993–94 after guiding Lethbridge to their first-ever appearance in post-season play with a 34–11–3 overall mark and a national CIS Cup title after defeating the Guelph Gryphons 5–2 in the championship final.

Spokane (WHL)

In 1994, Babcock was appointed head coach of the WHL&#x27;s Spokane Chiefs, with whom he posted a regular-season record of 224–172–29 over six seasons for a .564 winning percentage. He was twice named as the West Division coach of the year, in 1995–1996 and 1999–2000. The team advanced to the final round of the playoffs in 1995–96, a series they lost 4–1 to the Brandon Wheat Kings. The team also participated in the 1998 Memorial Cup by virtue of hosting the tournament; Spokane lost in the semi-final against the Guelph Storm, 2–1 in overtime.

Cincinnati (AHL)

From 2000–01 to 2001–02, Babcock guided the American Hockey League&#x27;s Cincinnati Mighty Ducks to a 74–59–20–7 record, including a franchise-high 41 wins and 95 points. The team qualified for the playoffs in both years.

===NHL (2002–2019)===
====Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (2002–2004)====
Babcock was named head coach of the NHL&#x27;s Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on May 22, 2002, and through two seasons, guided them to a combined 69–62–19–14 regular season record. In the Stanley Cup playoffs with the Ducks, he posted a 15–6 record, leading the Mighty Ducks to the team&#x27;s first Stanley Cup Finals in 2003, where they lost in seven games to the New Jersey Devils.

====Detroit Red Wings (2005–2015)====

Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Babcock declined an offer to remain with the Ducks, and on July 15, 2005, was named head coach of the Detroit Red Wings. In his first three seasons, Babcock led the Red Wings to a combined 162–56–28 regular season record and a 28–18 playoff record. The team won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy with the league&#x27;s best record in 2005–06 and 2007–08. In the 2006 playoffs, the heavily favored Red Wings were upset in the first round by the Edmonton Oilers. The following season, Babcock and the Red Wings were eliminated by his former club, the Anaheim Ducks, in the Western Conference Finals of the 2007 playoffs; the Ducks went on to win the Stanley Cup.

Babcock earned his 200th NHL career win the following season in Detroit&#x27;s 5–2 victory over the Florida Panthers on December 15, 2007. Babcock was selected to coach the Western Conference at the 2008 All-Star Game. The Red Wings entered the 2008 playoffs as favorites, and dispatched the Nashville Predators, Colorado Avalanche, and Dallas Stars en route to the Stanley Cup Finals. On June 4, 2008, he led the Red Wings to a Stanley Cup championship, the team&#x27;s fourth since 1997, by defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins in game six of the Finals.

Babcock was named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award after the season, awarded to the coach who best contributes to his team&#x27;s success, but ultimately finished third behind Bruce Boudreau of the Washington Capitals and Guy Carbonneau of the Montreal Canadiens. In June 2008, Babcock signed a three-year contract extension with the Red Wings.

In the 2008–09 season, the Red Wings finished second in the Western Conference and again made the Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced a re-match against the Penguins. Although the Wings had home-ice advantage and held a 3–2 series lead after a 5–0 victory at home in game five, the Penguins came back to avenge their loss and defeated Detroit in seven games. With the loss in game seven, Babcock became the first head coach to lose a Stanley Cup Finals series in game seven with two different teams.

In October 2010, Babcock signed a four-year extension with the Red Wings that saw him through to the end of the 2014–15 season. In the 2011 playoffs, Babcock&#x27;s Red Wings fell behind the San Jose Sharks three games to none in the second round but won three straight to force a seventh game, which the Wings lost 3–2.

On April 8, 2014, Babcock earned his 414th career win as head coach of the Red Wings, surpassing Jack Adams for most wins as coach in team history. Babcock was announced as a finalist for the Jack Adams Award for the 2013–14 season, his second nomination, but finished second in voting behind Patrick Roy of the Avalanche.

On December 6, 2014, Babcock earned his 500th career win as a head coach, becoming the second-fastest coach in NHL history to do so; only Hockey Hall of Famer and former Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman reached the 500-win plateau faster.

In 10 seasons with the Wings, Babcock coached the team past the 100-point plateau eight times; however, after their second consecutive trip to the Finals in 2009, the team won only three more playoff series under Babcock and failed to advance past the second round.

====Toronto Maple Leafs (2015–2019)====
After failing to come to terms on a contract extension with the Red Wings, Babcock received permission to seek employment elsewhere on May 8, 2015. The Buffalo Sabres, who had the best odds at picking first overall in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft for the right to select phenom Connor McDavid, were considered the most serious contenders for Babcock&#x27;s services, with the St. Louis Blues and San Jose Sharks also being in the mix. However, on May 20, 2015, it was announced that Babcock would become the new head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He signed an eight-year contract worth $50 million (an average of $6.25 million per season), making him the highest-paid coach in NHL history by more than double the previous record holder&#x27;s annual earnings. Before Babcock signed the contract, Todd McLellan of the Edmonton Oilers was the highest-paid coach in the NHL, reportedly earning $3 million per season. The Leafs had failed to make the playoffs in nine of the previous ten seasons, and had not won a playoff series since 2004. The signing of Babcock by general manager Lou Lamoriello was seen as an important move in changing the team&#x27;s fortunes.

On October 7, 2015, Babcock became the first NHL coach to use the league&#x27;s newly implemented coach&#x27;s challenge in a season opener loss against the Montreal Canadiens. Babcock coached his 1,000th NHL game during his first season with the Leafs, on February 4, 2016, against the New Jersey Devils. The Maple Leafs finished last overall that season, compiling a record of 29–42–11 for 69 points. However, the rebuilding team had been expected to do poorly. This season marked the first time Babcock missed the playoffs since 2004 with the Mighty Ducks. The last-place finish gave the Maple Leafs the best odds at winning the draft lottery ahead of the 2016 draft. They were awarded the first selection and picked the coveted centre Auston Matthews. The draft helped to increase expectations for the Leafs, and the 2016–17 season was marked by many high-end rookies making the team, including Matthews, William Nylander, Mitch Marner, Nikita Zaitsev and Connor Brown. Those rookies, along with the addition of goaltender Frederik Andersen, helped the team to qualify for the 2017 playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference, marking a rare occasion where a team goes from last in the league to capture a playoff appearance. Toronto faced the back-to-back Presidents&#x27; Trophy winning Washington Capitals in the first round. The Maple Leafs pushed the Capitals to six games—with five games going to overtime, tying an NHL record—before the team was eliminated by the Capitals. Babcock&#x27;s coaching was praised throughout the playoffs as it was during the regular season, with many lauding his attempts at player development while maintaining a high level of team success. Babcock was nominated for the Jack Adams Award, but once again lost, this time to John Tortorella of the Columbus Blue Jackets.

After their rapid turnaround, expectations for the Maple Leafs grew, but despite regular season success having finished as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference in both the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, the team proved unable to break through in the playoffs, losing seven-game first-round playoff series in back-to-back years to the Boston Bruins in 2018 and 2019.

On November 20, 2019, nearly two months into the 2019–20 season, the Maple Leafs fired Babcock after a six-game losing streak and amidst allegations of a toxic work environment. At the time, the team had a record of 9–10–4 and were outside of the playoffs, despite being projected before the season began to be playoff contenders. This was the first time in Babcock&#x27;s professional coaching career that he had been fired.

===College athletics (2020–2022)===
On July 29, 2020, the University of Vermont announced that Babcock would be joining the school&#x27;s Catamounts ice hockey team as an unpaid assistant coach under head coach Todd Woodcroft. On February 20, 2021, the University of Saskatchewan Huskies announced that Babcock would become the coach of the men&#x27;s ice hockey team for two seasons starting May 2021 on a volunteer basis. Babcock took the opportunity to coach in his hometown in large part for the chance to coach alongside his son, Michael Jr, who was pursuing a degree at the U of S and joined Mike on the bench as an assistant coach. Despite accepting a position with Saskatchewan, Babcock remained with Vermont until the end of the 2020–21 season.

Babcock opted to resign after one season with the Huskies on August 25, 2022, stating that he wanted to provide an opportunity for a bigger role for the team&#x27;s assistant coaches. The team had posted a 14–9 record under Babcock. The following day, Babcock announced that he was retiring from coaching.

===Columbus Blue Jackets (2023)===
On July 1, 2023, Babcock was named the head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets, his first NHL position since 2019, signing a two-year, $8 million contract to become the highest paid coach in team history. On September 12, ten weeks after being named head coach, allegations of improper behavior surfaced on the &quot;Spittin&#x27; Chiclets&quot; podcast, with reports that Babcock had ordered players to show him their cellphone photos as part of a character building exercise. In response to the reports, the NHL and NHLPA both opened investigations into Babcock&#x27;s behavior. Initial investigations did not find any reports of wrongdoing or discomfort from the players, including general manager Jarmo Kekäläinen, who Babcock had also asked to see photos from. However, as the investigations progressed, it was learned that several players, especially younger members of the roster, were uncomfortable with Babcock&#x27;s behavior. Shortly after both investigations concluded, the parties contacted the Blue Jackets with their findings, at which point the team determined that there was no scenario for Babcock to stay on. After two days of contract settlement negotiations, Babcock announced his resignation as head coach on September 17, before the start of the team&#x27;s training camp. The team subsequently apologized to their players for hiring Babcock amid fan criticism of the decision, given previous revelations regarding Babcock&#x27;s perceived toxic coaching methodologies and interactions in both Detroit and Toronto.

==International coaching career==
In addition to his club coaching roles, Babcock has had a long career coaching with Hockey Canada. He first coached Canada&#x27;s junior team at the 1997 World Junior Championships in Switzerland, where the country won a fifth consecutive gold medal, defeating the United States 2–0 in the final. Babcock coached Canada&#x27;s senior team for the first time at the 2004 IIHF World Championships in the Czech Republic, guiding Canada to a second consecutive gold medal with a 5–3 win over Sweden in the final.

On June 24, 2009, Babcock was announced as the head coach of Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The team finished the round robin with a regulation win over Norway, a shootout win over Switzerland, and a loss to the United States. In the elimination rounds they defeated Germany, Russia, and then Slovakia to advance to the final, where they defeated the United States 3–2 in overtime to win the gold medal. With the win, Babcock became the first coach—and only thus far—in the International Ice Hockey Federation&#x27;s Triple Gold Club, which he earned through his team&#x27;s Olympic Gold, World Championship gold, and 2008 Stanley Cup titles. To honour Babcock&#x27;s entrance into the Triple Gold Club, his hometown of Saskatoon announced that July 17, 2010 would be known as &quot;Mike Babcock Day.&quot;

On July 22, 2013, it was announced that Babcock would return as head coach of Team Canada for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The team finished the round robin with regulation wins over Norway, and Austria, and an overtime win over Finland. In the quarterfinals they defeated Latvia, and in the semifinals, they defeated the United States to advance to the gold medal game, where they defeated Sweden 3–0. With the win, Babcock became only the second head coach to lead one country to a gold medal victory in consecutive Olympic appearances, after Viktor Tikhonov with the Soviet team in 1984 and 1988.

Babcock also coached Canada to victory at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, making him the first and only coach to date to have won the Stanley Cup, World Cup, World Championship, and World Junior Championship, and coach an Olympic gold medal-winning team.

==Coaching style==
Babcock&#x27;s teams generally focus on puck possession over physical play and toughness. Babcock emphasized building a team that excelled at puck possession rather than enforcement in Detroit. Babcock&#x27;s teams consistently had the fewest penalty minutes of any NHL team; from 2005 to 2015, the Red Wings averaged 22 percent fewer penalty minutes than the league average, and 44 percent fewer penalty minutes than the highest league total.

===Criticism===
Babcock has faced public criticism from a number of former players who allege mistreatment throughout the length of his NHL career. Mike Commodore was among the first to voice public criticism towards Babcock, and has been among his fiercest critics, stemming from Commodore&#x27;s days in the Mighty Ducks organization. Commodore has alleged that Babcock purposefully held him back in Cincinnati because he did not like him, doing the same thing a decade later with the Red Wings after reassuring Commodore before the season that he would get playing time if he signed with the team. Babcock addressed Commodore&#x27;s criticisms in March 2021, stating that Commodore was scratched because he did not perform better than other defenders on the 2011–12 Red Wings team—he claimed that he did not recall many interactions with Commodore in Cincinnati—and refuted that Commodore was scratched because of a personal vendetta.

However, numerous other players have also voiced criticism of Babcock for his management style and treatment of players. Johan Franzén, who played for Babcock in Detroit, called him a &quot;terrible man, the worst person I&#x27;ve ever met,&quot; and accused Babcock of verbally abusing him during a game in the first round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Nashville Predators, which was corroborated by former teammate Chris Chelios. On their podcast &quot;Spittin&#x27; Chiclets&quot;, former NHL players Paul Bissonnette and Ryan Whitney described Babcock as &quot;a truly bad person&quot;, and his coaching methods as personally-directed psychological abuse. They contrasted Babcock with John Tortorella, another coach who is notoriously tough on his players, by noting that Tortorella&#x27;s methods are hockey related and he treats his players respectfully when off the ice.

Babcock has been criticized for mistreating both veteran and rookie players alike. He has been accused of scratching players ahead of games of personal significance, such as removing Mike Modano from the lineup before his 1500th game in towards the end of the 2010–11 season in April 2011 without any reasoning behind it, benching Chelios at the 2009 Winter Classic against his hometown team, the Chicago Blackhawks on January 1, 2009, and not playing Jason Spezza in the Maple Leafs&#x27; 2019–20 season-opening game on October 3, 2019, without any reasoning against his former team whom Spezza spent the bulk of his career with, the Ottawa Senators with his family and friends in attendance. Jason York has accused Babcock of arbitrarily banning a group of three veteran players from the Mighty Ducks training camp in 2002. Babcock was criticized for mistreating Mitch Marner during the 2016–17 season, his rookie season with the Maple Leafs, asking him in a January 2017 meeting to rank his teammates in order of their work ethic and then sharing the list with other members of the team—Babcock apologized to Marner for the incident. Moreover, Babcock has been accused of verbally abusing arena staff throughout his career.

Although Babcock&#x27;s coaching acumen has been generally praised as being superior to contemporaries (at times, being seen as the best coach in the sport), the revelations about his treatment of players were seen to have delayed his return to the NHL after he was fired by the Leafs in November 2019. He would not get another NHL job until his hiring by Columbus. Babcock&#x27;s brief tenure with the Blue Jackets was marked by controversy after it was reported in September 2023 that he had asked players in pre-season meetings to look through photos on their phones. Although the team and captain Boone Jenner initially downplayed the alleged incidents, an investigation by the NHLPA revealed that several members of the Blue Jackets were uncomfortable with Babcock&#x27;s approach and that in at least one instance, Babcock spent several minutes looking through a player&#x27;s phone. The controversy resulted in Babcock announcing his resignation before coaching a game for the team.

By the end of his time in Columbus, Babcock&#x27;s coaching methodologies, personality, and interpersonal interactions had led to him being broadly unpopular among hockey players and several hockey circles.

==Personal life==
Babcock is of Irish descent through a grandfather. Babcock and his wife, Maureen, have three children. Born in Manitouwadge, Ontario, he spent the majority of his childhood moving around between Northern Ontario, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories, before his family settled in Saskatoon, which he considers his hometown, in 1975. Babcock attended both St. James Elementary School and Holy Cross High School; Babcock is one of the many notable graduates on Holy Cross High School&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Honour.&quot;

Babcock has been an advocate for the Bell Let&#x27;s Talk campaign, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and other mental health awareness campaigns. In 2017, he became involved with a campaign called Ahead of the Game to raise money for youth mental health in sport.

On November 25, 2013, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by McGill University. He received the same honour from the University of Saskatchewan on June 2, 2016. Babcock was made a member of the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2018.

<text>Kenneth S. Hitchcock (born December 17, 1951) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey coach. Hitchcock coached the Dallas Stars, Philadelphia Flyers, Columbus Blue Jackets, St. Louis Blues and Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He also served as an assistant coach for Canada national team in the 2014 Winter Olympics. Hitchcock won a Stanley Cup with the Stars in 1999, and is the fourth-winningest coach in NHL history with a total of 849 victories. He was named a 2019 Order of Hockey in Canada recipient. Hitchcock was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 2023.

==Early years==
While growing up playing hockey in western Canada, Hitchcock found he could motivate players. This led him into coaching, first at various levels in the Edmonton area, and later a ten-year stint at the helm of the midget AAA Sherwood Park Chain Gang. Hitchcock led Sherwood Park to a record of 575–69. In his spare time, he taught hockey fundamentals to girls at a local hockey school.

Hitchcock submitted his credentials to the new owners of the WHL&#x27;s Kamloops Blazers, Gary Cooper and Colin Day. Hitchcock assumed his position behind the bench for the 1984–85 season and had an immediate effect on the Blazers, leading them to four consecutive division titles and league titles in 1985–86 and 1989–90. In both of the seasons he guided the Blazers to the league title, Hitchcock was named the WHL Coach of the Year, and he was named the top coach in Canadian major junior hockey in 1990. Hitch&#x27;s team appeared in the Memorial Cup tournament twice, never advancing beyond the semi-finals. In six seasons in Kamloops, Hitchcock recorded a 291–125–15 record, which stands as the second best in WHL history.

==NHL coaching career==

===Dallas Stars===
In 1990, Hitchcock left the WHL and joined the Philadelphia Flyers as an assistant coach. Hitchcock spent three seasons with the Flyers organization before leaving to helm the IHL affiliate of the Dallas Stars, the Kalamazoo Wings, for the 1993–94 season.

In the middle of his third season with the team (then renamed the Michigan K-Wings), he was offered the head coaching position with the Dallas Stars, and on January 8, 1996, he was named head coach, replacing Bob Gainey, who remained with the Stars as general manager. In his first full season with the Stars, he led the team to the Central Division title, the franchise&#x27;s first since 1984, when the team was still in Minnesota. In his second full season with the Stars, Hitchcock again led the Stars to the playoffs, losing in the Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings. Also during the 1997–98 season, Hitchcock was named to his first of three consecutive NHL All-Star Game teams as coach.

During the 1998–99 NHL season, Hitchcock led the Stars to a regular season record of 51–19–12. In the 1999 playoffs, Hitchcock led the team to a Stanley Cup victory over the Buffalo Sabres, the team&#x27;s first. The next season, Hitchcock again led the team to the Stanley Cup Finals, only to lose to the New Jersey Devils.

In the 2000–01 season, Hitchcock again led the Stars to the playoffs, but the team exited in the Conference Semifinals. Midway through the following season, after getting off to a mediocre 23–21–6 start and in the midst of strife between the players and management, Hitchcock was fired as head coach.

===Philadelphia Flyers===
Hitchcock was quickly picked up in the 2002 off-season by his old team, the Philadelphia Flyers, who had just fired their head coach, Bill Barber, after an early exit from the playoffs. Hitchcock brought much-needed discipline and direction to the Flyers and led them to a 45–24–13 record in his first season, losing in the Conference Semifinals. In Hitchcock&#x27;s second season with the Flyers, they finished first in the Atlantic Division with a 40–21–15 record and advanced to the Conference Finals, losing to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games.

In the 2006–07 NHL season, the Flyers got off to a 1–6–1 start over their first eight games, their worst start in 15 years. After a 9–1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres, management promised there would be some major changes to the organization. On October 22, 2006, the Flyers fired Hitchcock, and general manager Bobby Clarke stepped down. On November 1, the Flyers assigned Hitchcock to be a pro scout for the club.

===Columbus Blue Jackets===
On November 22, 2006, Hitchcock and the Columbus Blue Jackets agreed to a three-year contract to become their new head coach. He coached his first game for the Blue Jackets on November 24, against his former team, the Philadelphia Flyers, a game Columbus lost, 3–2.

On July 9, 2008, the Blue Jackets announced that they had signed Hitchcock to a three-year extension to remain as their head coach. On February 19, 2009, the Blue Jackets earned Hitchcock his 500th career NHL win as a head coach by defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs. On April 8, 2009, Hitchcock secured the Blue Jackets&#x27; first-ever postseason appearance with a 4–3 shootout win over the Chicago Blackhawks. Their playoff appearance would be a short one as they were swept in the Conference Quarterfinals by the Detroit Red Wings.

On November 11, 2009, in a 9–1 loss to the Detroit Red Wings, Hitchcock became the 16th NHL coach to reach the 1,000-game milestone. On February 3, 2010, the Blue Jackets relieved Hitchcock of his duties behind the bench and named assistant coach Claude Noël as the club&#x27;s interim head coach.

===St. Louis Blues===
On November 6, 2011, the St. Louis Blues fired coach Davis Payne and hired Hitchcock in his place. On June 20, 2012, Hitchcock won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL&#x27;s best head coach.

On February 12, 2015, Hitchcock earned his 693rd career regular season win in a 6–3 defeat of the Tampa Bay Lightning, passing Dick Irvin for sole possession of fourth place on the all-time coaching wins list. On March 12, Hitchcock earned his 700th career win as head coach in a 1–0 win over the Philadelphia Flyers.

In the 2015–16 season, Hitchcock coached the Blues to the Conference Finals. Despite home ice advantage against the San Jose Sharks, the Blues were defeated in six games. On May 31, 2016, Hitchcock announced that he would retire from coaching at the end of the 2016–17 season. However, Hitchcock did not finish his planned last season with St. Louis as on February 1, 2017, Hitchcock was fired by the Blues and was replaced by Mike Yeo. Hitchcock was fired one game before tying Al Arbour&#x27;s record (782) for third-most wins by an NHL head coach.

===Return to Dallas===
On April 13, 2017, Hitchcock was named as the head coach of the Dallas Stars for the second time. On December 21, Hitchcock earned his 800th win as NHL head coach when the Stars defeated the Blackhawks 4–0. On April 13, 2018, Hitchcock announced his retirement.

===Edmonton Oilers===
On November 20, 2018, Hitchcock came out of retirement and was named head coach of the Edmonton Oilers after Todd McLellan was relieved of his duties. In early May 2019, it was announced that Hitchcock was dismissed and would not return.

<text>Stock valuation is the method of calculating theoretical values of companies and their stocks. The main use of these methods is to predict future market prices, or more generally, potential market prices, and thus to profit from price movement – stocks that are judged &quot;undervalued&quot; (with respect to their theoretical value) are bought, while stocks that are judged &quot;overvalued&quot; are sold, in the expectation that undervalued stocks will overall rise in value, while overvalued stocks will generally decrease in value.
A target price is a price at which an analyst believes a stock to be fairly valued relative to its projected and historical earnings.

In the view of fundamental analysis, stock valuation based on fundamentals aims to give an estimate of the intrinsic value of a stock, based on predictions of the future cash flows and profitability of the business. Fundamental analysis may be replaced or augmented by market criteria – what the market will pay for the stock, disregarding intrinsic value. These can be combined as &quot;predictions of future cash flows/profits (fundamental)&quot;, together with &quot;what will the market pay for these profits?&quot; These can be seen as &quot;supply and demand&quot; sides – what underlies the supply (of stock), and what drives the (market) demand for stock?

Stock valuation is different from business valuation, which is about calculating the economic value of an owner&#x27;s interest in a business, used to determine the price interested parties would be willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of the business.
Re. valuation in cases where both parties are corporations, see under Mergers and acquisitions and Corporate finance.

== Fundamental criteria (fair value) ==
There are many different ways to value stocks. The key is to take each approach into account while formulating an overall opinion of the stock. If the valuation of a company is lower or higher than other similar stocks, then the next step would be to determine the reasons.

The first approach, Fundamental analysis, is typically associated with investors and financial analysts - its output is used to justify stock prices. 
The most theoretically sound stock valuation method, is called &quot;income valuation&quot; or the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. It is widely applied in all areas of finance.
Perhaps the most common fundamental methodology is the P/E ratio (Price to Earnings Ratio). This example of &quot;relative valuation&quot; is based on historic ratios and aims to assign value to a stock based on measurable attributes. This form of valuation is typically what drives long-term stock prices.

The alternative approach – Technical analysis – is to base the assessment on supply and demand: simply, the more people that want to buy the stock, the higher its price will be; and conversely, the more people that want to sell the stock, the lower the price will be. 
This form of valuation often drives the short-term stock market trends; and is associated with speculators as opposed to investors.

===Discounted cash flow===
The discounted cash flow (DCF) method involves discounting of the profits (dividends, earnings, or cash flows) that the stock will bring to the stockholder in the foreseeable future, and sometimes a final value on disposal, depending on the valuation method. DCF method assumes that borrowing and lending rates are same. The discounted rate normally includes a risk premium which is commonly based on the capital asset pricing model. 
For discussion of the mechanics, see Valuation using discounted cash flows.

In July 2010, a Delaware court ruled on appropriate inputs to use in discounted cash flow analysis in a dispute between shareholders and a company over the proper fair value of the stock. In this case the shareholders&#x27; model provided value of $139 per share and the company&#x27;s model provided $89 per share. Contested inputs included the terminal growth rate, the equity risk premium, and beta.

=== Earnings per share (EPS) ===

EPS is the Net income available to common shareholders of the company divided by the number of shares outstanding. Usually, there will be two types of EPS listed: a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) EPS and a Pro Forma EPS, which means that the income has been adjusted to exclude any one time items as well as some non-cash items like amortization of goodwill or stock option expenses. The most important thing to look for in the EPS figure is the overall quality of earnings. Make sure the company is not trying to manipulate their EPS numbers to make it look like they are more profitable. Also, look at the growth in EPS over the past several quarters / years to understand how volatile their EPS is, and to see if they are an underachiever or an overachiever. In other words, have they consistently beaten expectations or are they constantly restating and lowering their forecasts?

The EPS number that most analysts use is the pro forma EPS. To compute this number, use the net income that excludes any one-time gains or losses and excludes any non-cash expenses like amortization of goodwill. Never exclude non-cash compensation expense as that does impact earnings per share. Then divide this number by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding. Historical EPS figures and forecasts for the next 1–2 years can be found by visiting free financial sites such as Yahoo Finance (enter the ticker and then click on &quot;estimates&quot;).

=== Price to Earnings (P/E) ===
Now that the analyst has several EPS figures (historical and forecasts), the analyst will be able to look at the most common valuation technique used, the price to earnings ratio, or P/E. To compute this figure, one divides the stock price by the annual EPS figure. For example, if the stock is trading at $10 and the EPS is $0.50, the P/E is 20 times. A complete analysis of the P/E multiple includes a look at the historical and forward ratios.

Historical P/Es are computed by taking the current price divided by the sum of the EPS for the last four quarters, or for the previous year. Historical trends of the P/E should also be considered by viewing a chart of its historical P/E over the last several years (one can find this on most finance sites like Yahoo Finance). Specifically, consider what range the P/E has traded in so as to determine whether the current P/E is high or low versus its historical average.

Forward P/Es reflect the growth of the company into the future. Forward P/Es are computed by taking the current stock price divided by the sum of the EPS estimates for the next four quarters, or for the EPS estimate for next calendar or fiscal year or two.

P/Es change constantly. If there is a large price change in a stock, or if the earnings (EPS) estimates change, the ratio is recomputed.

=== Growth rate ===

Discounted cash flow based valuations rely (very) heavily on the expected growth rate of a company. An accurate assessment is therefore critical to the valuation

Here, the analyst will typically look at the historical growth rate of both sales and income to derive a base for the type of future growth expected. 
However, since, companies are constantly evolving, as is the economy, solely using historical growth rates to predict the future will not be appropriate (the &quot;problem of induction&quot;; see Discounted cash flow #Shortcomings). 
These, instead, are used as guidelines for what future growth &quot;could look like&quot; if similar circumstances are encountered by the company. 

Calculating the future growth rate, therefore, requires personal investment research – familiarity with a company is essential before making a forecast.
This may take form in listening to the company&#x27;s quarterly conference call or reading a press release or other company article that discusses the company&#x27;s growth guidance. 
However, although companies are in the best position to forecast their own growth, they are often far from accurate; further, unforeseen macro-events could cause impact the economy and /or the company&#x27;s industry.

Regardless of research effort, a growth-rate based valuation, therefore, relies heavily on experience and judgement (&quot;gut feel&quot;), and analysts will thus (often) make inaccurate forecasts. 
It is for this reason, that analysts often display a range of forecast values, especially based on different terminal value assumptions. 
[As an example here, if the company being valued has been growing earnings between 5 and 10% each year for the last 5 years, but believes that it will grow 15 –20% this year, a more conservative growth rate of 10–15% would be appropriate in valuations. Another example would be for a company that has been going through restructuring. It may have been growing earnings at 10–15% over the past several quarters or years because of cost cutting, but their sales growth could be only 0–5%. This would signal that their earnings growth will probably slow when the cost cutting has fully taken effect. Therefore, forecasting an earnings growth closer to the 0–5% rate would be more appropriate rather than the 15–20%.]

===Capital structure substitution - asset pricing formula===
The capital structure substitution theory (CSS) describes the relationship between earnings, stock price and capital structure of public companies. The equilibrium condition of the CSS theory can be easily rearranged to an asset pricing formula:

formula_1

where
* P is the current market price of public company x
* E is the earnings-per-share of company x
* R is the nominal interest rate on corporate bonds of company x
* T is the corporate tax rate

The CSS theory suggests that company share prices are strongly influenced by bondholders. As a result of active repurchasing or issuing of shares by company managements, equilibrium pricing is no longer a result of balancing shareholder demand and supply. The asset pricing formula only applies to debt-holding companies.

The asset pricing formula can be used on a market aggregate level as well. The resulting graph shows at what times the S&amp;P 500 Composite was overpriced and at what times it was under-priced relative to the capital structure substitution theory equilibrium. In times when the market is under-priced, corporate buyback programs will allow companies to drive up earnings-per-share, and generate extra demand in the stock market.

=== Price earnings to growth (PEG) ratio ===
This valuation technique has become popular over the past decade or so. It is better than simply looking at a P/E because it takes three factors into account; the price, earnings, and earnings growth rates. To compute the PEG ratio, the Forward P/E is divided by the expected earnings growth rate (one can also use historical P/E and historical growth rate to see where it has traded in the past). This will yield a ratio that is usually expressed as a percentage. The conjecture goes that as the percentage rises over 100% the stock becomes more and more overvalued, and as the PEG ratio falls below 100% the stock becomes more and more undervalued. The conjecture is based on a belief that P/E ratios should approximate the long-term growth rate of a company&#x27;s earnings. Whether or not this is true will never be proven and the conjecture is therefore just a rule of thumb to use in the overall valuation process.

Here is an example of how to use the PEG ratio to compare stocks. Stock A is trading at a forward P/E of 15 and expected to grow at 20%. Stock B is trading at a forward P/E of 30 and expected to grow at 25%. The PEG ratio for Stock A is 75% (15/20) and for Stock B is 120% (30/25). According to the PEG ratio, Stock A is a better purchase because it has a lower PEG ratio, or in other words, its future earnings growth can be purchased for a lower relative price than that of Stock B.

=== Sum of perpetuities method ===

The PEG ratio is a special case in the sum of perpetuities method (SPM) equation. A generalized version of the Walter model (1956), SPM considers the effects of dividends, earnings growth, as well as the risk profile of a firm on a stock&#x27;s value. Derived from the compound interest formula using the present value of a perpetuity equation, SPM is an alternative to the Gordon Growth Model. The variables are:

*formula_2 is the value of the stock or business
*formula_3 is a company&#x27;s earnings
*formula_4 is the company&#x27;s constant growth rate
*formula_5 is the company&#x27;s risk adjusted discount rate
*formula_6 is the company&#x27;s dividend payment

::formula_7

In a special case where formula_5 is equal to 10%, and the company does not pay dividends, SPM reduces to the PEG ratio.

Additional models represent the sum of perpetuities in terms of earnings, growth rate, the risk-adjusted discount rate, and accounting book value.

=== Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) ===

This valuation technique measures how much money the company makes each year per dollar of invested capital. Invested Capital is the amount of money invested in the company by both stockholders and debtors. The ratio is expressed as a percent and one looks for a percent that approximates the level of growth that expected. In its simplest definition, this ratio measures the investment return that management is able to get for its capital. The higher the number, the better the return.

To compute the ratio, take the pro forma net income (same one used in the EPS figure mentioned above) and divide it by the invested capital. Invested capital can be estimated by adding together the stockholders equity, the total long and short term debt and accounts payable, and then subtracting accounts receivable and cash (all of these numbers can be found on the company&#x27;s latest quarterly balance sheet). This ratio is much more useful when comparing it to other companies being valued.

=== Return on Assets (ROA) ===

Similar to ROIC, ROA, expressed as a percent, measures the company&#x27;s ability to make money from its assets. To measure the ROA, take the pro forma net income divided by the total assets. However, because of very common irregularities in balance sheets (due to things like Goodwill, write-offs, discontinuations, etc.) this ratio is not always a good indicator of the company&#x27;s potential. If the ratio is higher or lower than expected, one should look closely at the assets to see what could be over or understating the figure.

=== Price to Sales (P/S) ===

This figure is useful because it compares the current stock price to the annual sales. In other words, it describes how much the stock costs per dollar of sales earned.

=== Market Cap ===

Market cap, which is short for market capitalization, is the value of all of the company&#x27;s stock. To measure it, multiply the current stock price by the fully diluted shares outstanding. The market cap is only the value of the stock. To get a more complete picture, look at the enterprise value.

=== Enterprise Value (EV) ===

Enterprise value is equal to the total value of the company, as it is trading for on the stock market. To compute it, add the market cap (see above) and the total net debt of the company. The total net debt is equal to total long and short term debt plus accounts payable, minus accounts receivable, minus cash. The enterprise value is the best approximation of what a company is worth at any point in time because it takes into account the actual stock price instead of balance sheet prices. When analysts say that a company is a &quot;billion dollar&quot; company, they are often referring to its total enterprise value. Enterprise value fluctuates rapidly based on stock price changes.

=== EV to Sales ===

This ratio measures the total company value as compared to its annual sales. A high ratio means that the company&#x27;s value is much more than its sales. To compute it, divide the EV by the net sales for the last four quarters. This ratio is especially useful when valuing companies that do not have earnings, or that are going through unusually rough times. For example, if a company is facing restructuring and it is currently losing money, then the P/E ratio would be irrelevant. However, by applying an EV to Sales ratio, one could compute what that company could trade for when its restructuring is over and its earnings are back to normal.

=== EBITDA ===

EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It is one of the best measures of a company&#x27;s cash flow and is used for valuing both public and private companies. To compute EBITDA, use a company&#x27;s income statement, take the net income and then add back interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and any other non-cash or one-time charges. This results in a number that approximates how much cash the company is producing. EBITDA is a very popular figure because it can easily be compared across companies, even if not all of the companies are profit.

=== EV to EBITDA ===

This is perhaps one of the best measurements of whether or not a company is cheap or expensive. To compute, divide the EV by EBITDA (see above for calculations). The higher the number, the more expensive the company is. However, more expensive companies are often valued higher because they are growing faster or because they are a higher quality company. With that said, the best way to use EV/EBITDA is to compare it to that of other similar companies.

=== Approximate valuation approaches ===

==== Average growth approximation ====

Assuming that two stocks have the same earnings growth, the one with a lower P/E is a better value. The P/E method is perhaps the most commonly used valuation method in the stock brokerage industry. By using comparison firms, a target price/earnings (or P/E) ratio is selected for the company, and then the future earnings of the company are estimated. The valuation&#x27;s fair price is simply estimated earnings times target P/E. This model is essentially the same model as Gordon&#x27;s model, if k-g is estimated as the dividend payout ratio (D/E) divided by the target P/E ratio.

==== Constant growth approximation ====

The Gordon model or &quot;Gordon&#x27;s growth model&quot;
is the best known of a class of discounted dividend models. It assumes that dividends will increase at a constant growth rate (less than the discount rate) forever. The valuation is given by the formula:

:formula_9 .

and the following table defines each symbol:
Dividend growth rate is not known, but earnings growth may be used in its place, assuming that the payout ratio is constant.

<text>Zachary Knight Galifianakis (; born October 1, 1969) is an American actor and comedian. The accolades he has received include two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award.

Galifianakis is known for his role as Alan in &quot;The Hangover&quot; trilogy (2009–2013). On television, he starred in the FX series &quot;Baskets&quot; (2016–2019), which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2017. He also hosted the Funny or Die talk show &quot;Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis&quot; (2008–2018).

Galifianakis&#x27;s other films include &quot;Due Date&quot; (2010), &quot;It&#x27;s Kind of a Funny Story&quot; (2010), &quot;The Campaign&quot; (2012) and &quot;Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot; (2014). He has also voiced characters in animated films such as &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (2011), &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017), &quot;Missing Link&quot; (2019), &quot;Ron&#x27;s Gone Wrong&quot; (2021) and &quot;The Bob&#x27;s Burgers Movie&quot; (2022).

== Early life ==
Zachary Knight Galifianakis was born in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, on October 1, 1969, to community arts center director Mary Frances (née Cashion) and heating oil vendor Harry Galifianakis. His mother is of Scots-Irish descent, while his paternal grandparents were Greek immigrants from Crete. He was baptized in his father&#x27;s Greek Orthodox faith.

He has a younger sister, Merritt, and an older brother, Greg. Their cousin is &quot;Washington Post&quot; cartoonist Nick Galifianakis, while their uncle, also named Nick Galifianakis, was a Durham attorney and politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1967 to 1973.

He attended Wilkes Central High School, Wilkes Community College and subsequently attended North Carolina State University, where he majored in communications. While in college, Galifianakis worked at a public access station. He taught a waltz class in 1991 and crossed paths with Mary J. Blige there.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
After his television debut on &quot;Boston Common&quot;, Galifianakis joined &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for two weeks. He has stated &quot;I worked on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for two weeks, and Britney Spears was the host one week when I was doing it. Wrote a sketch, Will Ferrell was going to play a bodyguard to her belly-button, and we were going to shrink Will down to fit into a belly-button. ...she just stared at me after I explained it to her. And then, she finally goes &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s funny.&#x27;&quot; Galifianakis co-starred in the film &quot;Out Cold&quot;, and had small roles in &quot;Corky Romano&quot;, &quot;Below&quot;, &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;, &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, &quot;Super High Me&quot;, &quot;Little Fish Strange Pond&quot; and &quot;Largo&quot;.
In September 2001, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot;. It included a stand-up routine, a segment with a piano, and a cappella group The Night Owls (introduced as his &quot;12 ex-girlfriends&quot;) singing &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; by The Bangles while he made jokes. In 2002, he hosted his own VH1 talk show called &quot;Late World with Zach&quot;. It featured many of his friends and regular performers from the Los Angeles comedy and music venue Largo where he appeared frequently during this time period. He played Davis in the Fox drama series &quot;Tru Calling&quot;. He appeared many times on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and played Frisbee in &quot;Reno 911!&quot;

Galifianakis played Alan Finger on the Comedy Central show &quot;Dog Bites Man&quot;, a fake news program that caught people during candid moments thinking they were being interviewed by a real news crew. He also guest-starred in the episode of the Comedy Central show &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot; as Fred the Homeless Guy. He also had a recurring guest role as a doctor on the animated Adult Swim show &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; and appeared in several episodes of &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; in a recurring role as Tairy Greene.

In 2006, Galifianakis appeared in Fiona Apple&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Not About Love&quot;, where he is seen lip-syncing the lyrics to the song. A year later, Kanye West employed Galifianakis and indie rock musician Will Oldham for similar purposes in the second version of the video for his song &quot;Can&#x27;t Tell Me Nothing&quot;. In June 2006, Galifianakis released the single &quot;Come On and Get It (Up in &#x27;Dem Guts)&quot;, a comedic hip-hop dance song which features Apple&#x27;s vocals.

Galifianakis, Patton Oswalt, Brian Posehn and Maria Bamford, are the four Comedians of Comedy, a periodic packaged comedy tour in the style of The Original Kings of Comedy and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. They chose to perform at live rock clubs as opposed to comedy clubs to try to reach a different audience. Much of the tour was taped and has been featured in both a short-lived TV series on Comedy Central and a full-length film that has appeared at SXSW and on Showtime. On February 22, 2008, he made an appearance on the &quot;Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover&quot;. He interviewed various members of the &quot;Jackass&quot; cast. Galifianakis starred in first leading role in the independent film &quot;Visioneers&quot; which premiered in 2008. The film was released on direct-to-DVD. That same year, Galifianakis appeared in a web video series of advertisements for Absolut vodka, along with Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, creating a parody of the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; in which one has a deep anger issue, breaking the fourth wall in exasperation and outright violence on the set. He also completed the pilot &quot;Speed Freaks&quot; for Comedy Central.

His 2006 stand-up concert film &quot;Zach Galifianakis Live at the Purple Onion&quot; was one of the first original programs from Netflix.

===&quot;Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis&quot;===
Galifianakis has a series of videos on the Funny or Die website titled &quot;Between Two Ferns With Zach Galifianakis&quot; where he conducts interviews with popular celebrities between two potted ferns. He has interviewed Jimmy Kimmel, Michael Cera, Jon Hamm, Natalie Portman, Charlize Theron, Bradley Cooper, Carrot Top, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Andy Richter, Andy Dick, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell, Sean Penn, Bruce Willis, Tila Tequila, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Samuel L. Jackson, Tobey Maguire, Arcade Fire, Justin Bieber, Brie Larson, David Letterman, former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Brad Pitt, and Keanu Reeves. His interview style consists of typical interview questions, bizarre non sequiturs, awkward product endorsements, and sometimes inappropriate sexual questions and comments. Galifianakis won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program as a producer of the show at the 66th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

=== Mainstream performances ===
Galifianakis played Alan Garner in the hit comedy &quot;The Hangover&quot; and earned the MTV Movie Award for the Best Comedic Performance. He was also prominently advertised in subsequent films that featured him in supporting roles, such as &quot;G-Force&quot;, &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot;, and &quot;Up in the Air&quot;.

Galifianakis starred in the HBO series &quot;Bored to Death&quot; and hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on March 6, 2010 during the show&#x27;s 35th season, during which he shaved his beard mid-show for a sketch, and closed the show wearing a fake one. He hosted again on March 12, 2011, and shaved his head this time, in a Mr. T-like hairstyle, which was allegedly supposed to be used for a sketch that never aired due to time constraints.

In 2010, he starred in several films, including &quot;Dinner for Schmucks&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Kind of a Funny Story&quot;, and &quot;Due Date&quot;. On October 29, 2010, while debating marijuana legalization on the show HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, Galifianakis appeared to have smoked marijuana on live television; host Bill Maher denied that it was real marijuana in an interview with Wolf Blitzer during an episode of &quot;The Situation Room&quot;. In 2011, he reprised his role for &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot;, which was set in Thailand, and voiced Humpty Dumpty in &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;. Galifianakis starred alongside Will Ferrell in Jay Roach&#x27;s 2012 political comedy &quot;The Campaign&quot;. He received critical praise for his performance in the 2014 film &quot;Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot;, in which he starred with Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, and Edward Norton. In 2017, Galifianakis voiced The Joker in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;. In February 2023, Galifianakis joined the live-action film adaptation of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; as Jumba.

== Charity work ==
In January 2014, Galifianakis and his &quot;Night of a Thousand Vaginas&quot; co-star Sarah Silverman announced their intention to raise $20,000 to help fund the Texas Abortion Fund, part of a nationwide network of funds set up to assist women in obtaining abortions in states whose legislatures had placed restrictions on the practice. The fundraiser was set up in response to the passage of Texas H.B. 2, which established several restrictions that forced a majority of the state&#x27;s abortion clinics to close.

Galifianakis befriended Marie &quot;Mimi&quot; Haist, a homeless woman in her 80s who was living in a Santa Monica laundromat for 18 years, and bought her an apartment across the street from the laundromat. The story was revealed in the 2015 documentary &quot;Queen Mimi&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In August 2012, Zach Galifianakis married Canadian charity worker Quinn Lundberg at the UBC Farm in Vancouver. They have two sons together: one born on September 7, 2013 (Galifianakis skipped the premiere of his film &quot;Are You Here&quot; to attend the birth) and another born on November 7, 2016.

Galifianakis has a house in Venice, Los Angeles and previously lived in Brooklyn. Galifianakis owns a farm in Sparta, North Carolina, and splits his time between the farm and his work. He said, &quot;My farm is a place that I get to think clearly and pretend to know what I am doing.&quot; He also resides on an Island in British Columbia, Canada.

<text>The Conemaugh River is a tributary of the Kiskiminetas River in Westmoreland, Indiana, and Cambria counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The name means &#x27;Otter Creek&#x27;, originating from the Unami-Lenape language word &quot;kwənəmuxkw&quot; &#x27;otter&#x27;.

== Course ==

The Conemaugh River is formed at Johnstown (site of the Johnstown Flood) in southwestern Cambria County by the confluence of the Little Conemaugh and Stonycreek rivers. It flows generally west–northwest, in a winding course through the mountains along the northern edge of Laurel Hill and Chestnut Ridge. Northwest of Blairsville it is joined by Blacklick Creek. At Saltsburg it is joined from the south by Loyalhanna Creek to form the Kiskiminetas River. Along much of its lower course, the Conemaugh forms part of the boundary between Westmoreland and Indiana counties.

== Watershed ==

The Kiskiminetas-Conemaugh river basin flows through scenic mountainous country that forms the heart of the historic coal-producing areas of western Pennsylvania. Before the Dam was constructed, the town of Livermore served the area between Blairsville and Saltsburg as an important stop along the former canal, as well as the railroad. The watershed is considered among the most degraded in the state, largely from abandoned mine drainages. The recovery of the river has been an important ongoing ecological management project of state and private agencies.

<text>Boogie Pimps are an electronic music duo from Erfurt, Germany. It was formed by two DJs: Mark J Klak and Mirko Jacob.

==History==
Their collaboration started in 2000, when Mirko Jacob started performing in Klak&#x27;s JoueJoueClub in Erfurt. Jacob has since left the group, and his place was filled by Australian-born Jon Henderson.

In Autumn 2003, Boogie Pimps released their first single, a remix of Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s cover of The Great Society&#x27;s &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;. In January 2004, this song entered the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. The music video for &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; features several infants sky diving out of an aeroplane towards a giant woman (Natasha Mealey) lying on a grassy hill country landscape in her underwear, singing the song.

Their second single, &quot;Sunny&quot; is also a cover, originally recorded by Bobby Hebb.

In 2004, they appeared on a white label record, which was not widely released, under the pseudonym &#x27;Pimps Guerilla&#x27;. They performed songs such as &quot;Right Out of Here&quot; and &quot;Make &#x27;em Drop&quot;. While &quot;Make &#x27;em Drop&quot; made it onto a few compilations, &quot;Right Out of Here&quot; is not commercially available, with the exception of white labels. This could be for legal reasons, as extracts of lyrics and melody were sampled from the end of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

<text>Juan Martín Maldacena (born 10 September 1968) is an Argentine theoretical physicist and the Carl P. Feinberg Professor in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. He has made significant contributions to the foundations of string theory and quantum gravity. His most famous discovery is the AdS/CFT correspondence, a realization of the holographic principle in string theory.

==Biography==

Maldacena obtained his &quot;licenciatura&quot; (a six-year degree) in 1991 at the Instituto Balseiro, Bariloche, Argentina, under the supervision of Gerardo Aldazábal. He then obtained his Ph.D. in physics at Princeton University after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Black holes in string theory&quot; under the supervision of Curtis Callan in 1996, and went on to a post-doctoral position at Rutgers University. In 1997, he joined Harvard University as associate professor, being quickly promoted to Professor of Physics in 1999. Since 2001 he has been a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and in 2016 became the first Carl P. Feinberg Professor of Theoretical Physics in the institute&#x27;s School of Natural Sciences.

Maldacena is a member of the Society of Catholic Scientists.
== Contributions to physics ==
Maldacena has made numerous discoveries in theoretical physics. Leonard Susskind called him &quot;perhaps the greatest physicist of his generation... certainly the greatest theoretical physicist of his generation&quot;. His most famous discovery is the most reliable realization of the holographic principle – namely the AdS/CFT correspondence, a conjecture about the equivalence of string theory on Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, and a conformal field theory defined on the boundary of the AdS space. According to the conjecture, certain theories of quantum gravity are equivalent to other quantum mechanical theories (with no gravitational force) in one fewer spacetime dimensions.

In subsequent works, Maldacena elucidated several aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, describing how certain physical observables defined in one theory can be described in the equivalent theory. Shortly after his original work on the AdS/CFT correspondence, Maldacena showed how Wilson lines can be computed in a corresponding string theory by considering the area swept by an evolving fundamental string. Wilson lines are non-local physical observables defined in gauge theory. In 2001, Maldacena proposed that an eternal black hole, an object defined in a gravitational theory, is equivalent to a certain entangled state involving two copies of the corresponding quantum mechanical theory. Ordinary black holes emit Hawking radiation and eventually evaporate. An eternal black hole is a type of black hole that survives forever because it eventually re-absorbs the radiation it emits.

In 2013, Maldacena co-authored an analysis of the 2012 black hole firewall paradox with Leonard Susskind, arguing that the paradox can be resolved if entangled particles are connected by minor wormholes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/Mystery Wrapped&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="644437" wikidata="Q330714" url="?curid=644437" title="Bob Hartley">
<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hartley (born September 7, 1960) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach. He most recently served as the head coach of Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He has additionally coached the Latvia men&#x27;s national ice hockey team. He coached the Colorado Avalanche from 1998–2002 and won the Stanley Cup in 2001. He also coached the Atlanta Thrashers from the 2003–04 season up until the beginning of the 2007–08 season, when he was fired after the Thrashers got off to an 0–6 start. Hartley was an ice hockey analyst for the French-language RDS television channel until 2011, when he became the head coach of the ZSC Lions of the Swiss National League A. From 2012 to 2016, Hartley was the head coach of the Calgary Flames.

==Early years==
Bob Hartley never played a game in the NHL, instead beginning his coaching career with a junior A team in his hometown of Hawkesbury. After guiding the team to a championship, his accolades caught the eye of the Laval Titan of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). While Hartley was coaching the junior A Hawkesbury Hawks, he worked full-time as an assembly line worker at PPG Industries in Hawkesbury.

==Coaching career==

===Laval Titan===
Hartley&#x27;s tenure as the Laval Titan head coach was marked with success. He recorded an 81–52–7 record in two seasons with the team. In his second season as the team&#x27;s head coach, he guided the team to a Memorial Cup participation in 1993.

===American Hockey League===
Hartley was hired as an assistant coach of the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s Cornwall Aces under Jacques Martin. When Martin was appointed assistant coach of the parent Quebec Nordiques, Hartley was promoted to head coach and guided the Aces to two division titles during the team&#x27;s three-year history. When the relocated Nordiques, now known as the Colorado Avalanche, became affiliated with the Hershey Bears, Hartley followed the team and was named head coach of the Bears. Hartley&#x27;s tenure with the Bears was a success as he guided the team to four consecutive playoff appearances and a Calder Cup title in 1997.

===Colorado Avalanche===
Hartley&#x27;s success with the Bears caught the eye of then-Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix, who was looking for a replacement for Marc Crawford, who had suddenly resigned after a surprising first round playoff exit. Hartley was hired as the team&#x27;s second head coach since the relocation to Denver on June 2, 1998. In his first season with the Avalanche, the team got off to a 2–1–6 start, the mediocre start prompted skeptics to question the hiring. When the team caught fire in mid-December, they won their first Northwest Division title and fifth-straight overall. During the 1999 Stanley Cup playoffs, the team defeated the San Jose Sharks in the first round and halted the Detroit Red Wings quest for a three-peat before bowing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars in the Western Finals. Hartley&#x27;s second season saw the team win their sixth consecutive division title along with playoff victories over the Phoenix Coyotes and a rematch with the Red Wings before bowing to the defending champion Dallas in the Western Final for the second consecutive year.

Hartley&#x27;s third season was ultimately his most successful one. Motivated by Ray Bourque&#x27;s desire to win a Stanley Cup championship, the Avalanche coasted through the league with a 52–16–10–4 record, a seventh consecutive division title along with the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. The playoffs began with a first round sweep of the eighth seed Vancouver Canucks before enduring a seven-game scare by the Los Angeles Kings in the Western Semi-Finals before taking down the St. Louis Blues in five games, setting up a Stanley Cup Finals matchup with the Eastern Conference&#x27;s top seed, the New Jersey Devils. After falling behind three games to two in the series, the Avalanche rallied back to win the Stanley Cup, accomplishing Bourque&#x27;s goal and making it the second-straight year the defending champions had lost in the finals, as the Devils themselves defeated the 1999 champion Dallas Stars the year prior.

Another notable milestone from the 2000–01 NHL season for Hartley included coaching the North American All-Star team to a 14–11 victory on home ice. Hartley brought the Stanley Cup to his hometown of Hawkesbury, bringing the trophy to the PPG Industries plant he worked at. The following season, the team won their eighth consecutive division title and looked sharp in their quest for a second consecutive Stanley Cup. At the start of the playoffs, Hartley became the first head coach since Billy Reay to guide his teams to four consecutive conference final appearances. After two grueling playoff series victories over the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks, in a repeat of the 1997 Western Finals, the team bowed to the archrival Detroit Red Wings, who would go on to win the Stanley Cup. Hartley&#x27;s tenure with the Avalanche ended on December 17, 2002, when the team endured a 10–8–9–4 start and he was replaced by assistant coach Tony Granato. Hartley left the Avalanche franchise with a 193–109–48 regular season record and a 49–31 playoff record. His 193 wins were the most in the Colorado portion of franchise history at the time. He became the only coach in team history to record 40 or more wins during his first four seasons as head coach.

===Atlanta Thrashers===
One month after being fired by the Avalanche, Hartley was appointed as the second full-time head coach of the Atlanta Thrashers, who were looking for a replacement after original head coach Curt Fraser was fired following an 8–20–4–1 start on January 15, 2003. Hartley immediately went to work on the team&#x27;s fortunes. The team went 20–14–5–1 down the stretch and were in the playoff race for the second half of the season, giving hope to Thrasher fans. Hartley&#x27;s first full season behind the Atlanta bench began with tragedy following the death of Dan Snyder and loss of Dany Heatley for the majority of the season. The team overcame the adversity and set new franchise records for wins and points in a single season with a 33–37–8–4 record. Under Hartley&#x27;s guidance, rising star Ilya Kovalchuk became a tri-winner of the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy. Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Thrashers endured yet another slow start and multiple injuries at the goaltending position. After original goaltenders Kari Lehtonen and Mike Dunham were injured, Hartley was forced to use prospects Adam Berkhoel and Michael Garnett along with journeyman Steve Shields, the Thrashers posted the first winning season in franchise history with a 41–33–8 record, but fell short for a playoff appearance after losing out to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the final week of the regular season by two points. The 2006–07 NHL season was one of many accomplishments for the young Thrashers under Hartley&#x27;s guidance. The team won their first Southeast Division title, setting new franchise records for wins and points with a 43–28–11 record, good enough for 97 points and third seed in the Eastern Conference. The team also clinched its first playoff berth in franchise history and played the New York Rangers in the first round. As of April 16, 2007, Hartley is the all-time winningest coach in franchise history. On October 17, 2007, Hartley was fired and was temporarily replaced by Don Waddell, the general manager at the time. Hartley was under fire because the team had yet to register a point in six regular season games, was 30th and 27th in the NHL in goals for and against, respectively.

===ZSC Lions===
On March 14, 2011, Hartley signed a two-year contract to coach the ZSC Lions, replacing former Sweden national team head coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson. On April 17, 2012, Hartley led ZSC Lions to a Game 7 upset victory against favourite SC Bern to claim the Swiss championship. Hartley then used his escape clause to return to the NHL and was replaced as Lions head coach by Marc Crawford, the man he had replaced as Avalanche head coach in 1998.

===Calgary Flames===
On May 31, 2012, Hartley returned to the NHL as head coach of the Calgary Flames. On June 24, 2015, Hartley won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL&#x27;s coach of the year. He was the first coach in Flames franchise history to win the award. He was fired on May 3, 2016, less than one year after receiving the award, but achieving a 134–135–25 record and one playoff appearance over his four seasons in Calgary.

===Latvian national team===
On December 20, 2016, the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation announced that Hartley agreed to become the head coach of Latvia national team. During the 2021 IIHF World Championship, he led the Latvians to victory in a match against Canada, scoring 2-0. This historical victory marked the first time Latvia won against the superior Canadian men&#x27;s national ice hockey team.

===Avangard Omsk===
On May 27, 2018, he was appointed head coach of Avangard Omsk, playing in the Kontinental Hockey League. He signed a contract with Avangard for a period of two years. He brought the team to the final of the Gagarin Cup, in which the club from Omsk lost in four matches to CSKA Moscow.

On April 28, 2021, while remaining the head coach of Avangard, he won the Gagarin Cup.

==Personal life==
Hartley and his wife Micheline have one daughter, Kristine, and one son, Steve.

Despite his anglophone-sounding name, Hartley is a Franco-Ontarian. French is his first language; his English has a marked French accent.

<doc id="644443" wikidata="Q543413" url="?curid=644443" title="AdS/CFT correspondence">
<text>In theoretical physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (frequently abbreviated as AdS/CFT) is a conjectured relationship between two kinds of physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) that are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On the other side of the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) that are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.

The duality represents a major advance in the understanding of string theory and quantum gravity. This is because it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and because it is the most successful realization of the holographic principle, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard &#x27;t Hooft and promoted by Leonard Susskind.

It also provides a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of the usefulness of the duality results from the fact that it is a strong–weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.

The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997. Important aspects of the correspondence were soon elaborated on in two articles, one by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov and Alexander Polyakov, and another by Edward Witten. By 2015, Maldacena&#x27;s article had over 10,000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of high energy physics.

One of the most prominent examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence has been the AdS5/CFT4 correspondence: a relation between &quot;N&quot; = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory in 3+1 dimensions and type IIB superstring theory on .

== Background ==

=== Quantum gravity and strings ===

Current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity in terms of the geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics that was developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed in the first half of the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.

Quantum gravity is the branch of physics that seeks to describe gravity using the principles of quantum mechanics. Currently, a popular approach to quantum gravity is string theory, which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called strings. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically considers theories of quantum gravity derived from string theory or its modern extension, M-theory.

In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is one dimension of time. Thus, in the language of modern physics, one says that spacetime is four-dimensional. One peculiar feature of string theory and M-theory is that these theories require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency: in string theory spacetime is ten-dimensional, while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional. The quantum gravity theories appearing in the AdS/CFT correspondence are typically obtained from string and M-theory by a process known as compactification. This produces a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions and the extra dimensions are &quot;curled up&quot; into circles.

A standard analogy for compactification is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.

=== Quantum field theory ===

The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are extended in space and time, is known as quantum field theory. In particle physics, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields. Quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle-like objects called quasiparticles.

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in addition to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.

== Overview of the correspondence ==

=== Geometry of anti-de Sitter space ===

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers string theory or M-theory on an anti-de Sitter background. This means that the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain vacuum solution of Einstein&#x27;s equation called anti-de Sitter space.

In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the metric) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It is closely related to hyperbolic space, which can be viewed as a disk as illustrated on the right. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.

Now imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.

This construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space and one time dimension, but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions. Indeed, hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can &quot;stack up&quot; copies of hyperbolic space to get higher-dimensional models of anti-de Sitter space.

=== Idea of AdS/CFT ===

An important feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder in the case of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any point, it looks just like Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.

One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which &quot;spacetime&quot; is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for the AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the &quot;spacetime&quot; for a conformal field theory. The claim is that this conformal field theory is equivalent to the gravitational theory on the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a &quot;dictionary&quot; for translating calculations in one theory into calculations in the other. Every entity in one theory has a counterpart in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.

Notice that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space has fewer dimensions than anti-de Sitter space itself. For instance, in the three-dimensional example illustrated above, the boundary is a two-dimensional surface. The AdS/CFT correspondence is often described as a &quot;holographic duality&quot; because this relationship between the two theories is similar to the relationship between a three-dimensional object and its image as a hologram. Although a hologram is two-dimensional, it encodes information about all three dimensions of the object it represents. In the same way, theories that are related by the AdS/CFT correspondence are conjectured to be &quot;exactly&quot; equivalent, despite living in different numbers of dimensions. The conformal field theory is like a hologram that captures information about the higher-dimensional quantum gravity theory.

=== Examples of the correspondence ===

Following Maldacena&#x27;s insight in 1997, theorists have discovered many different realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions. The theories involved are generally not viable models of the real world, but they have certain features, such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry, which make them useful for solving problems in quantum field theory and quantum gravity.

The most famous example of the AdS/CFT correspondence states that type IIB string theory on the product space is equivalent to &quot;N&quot; = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory on the four-dimensional boundary. In this example, the spacetime on which the gravitational theory lives is effectively five-dimensional (hence the notation AdS5), and there are five additional compact dimensions (encoded by the &quot;S&quot;5 factor). In the real world, spacetime is four-dimensional, at least macroscopically, so this version of the correspondence does not provide a realistic model of gravity. Likewise, the dual theory is not a viable model of any real-world system as it assumes a large amount of supersymmetry. Nevertheless, as explained below, this boundary theory shares some features in common with quantum chromodynamics, the fundamental theory of the strong force. It describes particles similar to the gluons of quantum chromodynamics together with certain fermions. As a result, it has found applications in nuclear physics, particularly in the study of the quark–gluon plasma.

Another realization of the correspondence states that M-theory on is equivalent to the so-called (2,0)-theory in six dimensions. In this example, the spacetime of the gravitational theory is effectively seven-dimensional. The existence of the (2,0)-theory that appears on one side of the duality is predicted by the classification of superconformal field theories. It is still poorly understood because it is a quantum mechanical theory without a classical limit. Despite the inherent difficulty in studying this theory, it is considered to be an interesting object for a variety of reasons, both physical and mathematical.

Yet another realization of the correspondence states that M-theory on is equivalent to the ABJM superconformal field theory in three dimensions. Here the gravitational theory has four noncompact dimensions, so this version of the correspondence provides a somewhat more realistic description of gravity.

=== A non-perturbative formulation of string theory ===

In quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman and others in the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.

The starting point for string theory is the idea that the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.

The problem of developing a non-perturbative formulation of string theory was one of the original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides several examples of quantum field theories that are equivalent to string theory on anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a &quot;definition&quot; of string theory in the special case where the gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in the dual quantum field theory.

=== Black hole information paradox ===

In 1975, Stephen Hawking published a calculation that suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. At first, Hawking&#x27;s result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking&#x27;s calculation seemed to conflict with one of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics, which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking&#x27;s calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the black hole information paradox.

The AdS/CFT correspondence resolves the black hole information paradox, at least to some extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so the black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.

=== Nuclear physics ===

One physical system that has been studied using the AdS/CFT correspondence is the quark–gluon plasma, an exotic state of matter produced in particle accelerators. This state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy ions such as gold or lead nuclei are collided at high energies. Such collisions cause the quarks that make up atomic nuclei to deconfine at temperatures of approximately two trillion kelvins, conditions similar to those present at around 10−11 seconds after the Big Bang.

The physics of the quark–gluon plasma is governed by quantum chromodynamics, but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving the quark–gluon plasma. In an article appearing in 2005, Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence could be used to understand some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory. By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, Sơn and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark–gluon plasma, the shear viscosity &quot;η&quot; and volume density of entropy &quot;s&quot;, should be approximately equal to a certain universal constant:
: formula_1
where &quot;ħ&quot; denotes the reduced Planck constant and &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant. In addition, the authors conjectured that this universal constant provides a lower bound for &quot;η&quot;/&quot;s&quot; in a large class of systems. In an experiment conducted at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the experimental result in one model was close to this universal constant but it was not the case in another model.

Another important property of the quark–gluon plasma is that very high energy quarks moving through the plasma are stopped or &quot;quenched&quot; after traveling only a few femtometres. This phenomenon is characterized by a number called the jet quenching parameter, which relates the energy loss of such a quark to the squared distance traveled through the plasma. Calculations based on the AdS/CFT correspondence give the estimated value , and the experimental value of lies in the range .

=== Condensed matter physics ===

Over the decades, experimental condensed matter physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter, including superconductors and superfluids. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including Subir Sachdev hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.

So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on the Planck constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.

=== Criticism ===
With many physicists turning towards string-based methods to solve problems in nuclear and condensed matter physics, some theorists working in these areas have expressed doubts about whether the AdS/CFT correspondence can provide the tools needed to realistically model real-world systems. In a talk at the Quark Matter conference in 2006, an American physicist, Larry McLerran pointed out that the super Yang–Mills theory that appears in the AdS/CFT correspondence differs significantly from quantum chromodynamics, making it difficult to apply these methods to nuclear physics. According to McLerran,

In a letter to Physics Today, Nobel laureate Philip W. Anderson voiced similar concerns about applications of AdS/CFT to condensed matter physics, stating

== History and development ==

=== String theory and nuclear physics ===

The discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 was the culmination of a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are held together by the strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.

On the other hand, attempts to model hadrons as strings faced serious problems. One problem was that string theory includes a massless spin-2 particle whereas no such particle appears in the physics of hadrons. Such a particle would mediate a force with the properties of gravity. In 1974, Joël Scherk and John Schwarz suggested that string theory was therefore not a theory of nuclear physics as many theorists had thought but instead a theory of quantum gravity. At the same time, it was realized that hadrons are actually made of quarks, and the string theory approach was abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics.

In quantum chromodynamics, quarks have a kind of charge that comes in three varieties called colors. In a paper from 1974, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft studied the relationship between string theory and nuclear physics from another point of view by considering theories similar to quantum chromodynamics, where the number of colors is some arbitrary number &quot;N&quot;, rather than three. In this article, &#x27;t Hooft considered a certain limit where &quot;N&quot; tends to infinity and argued that in this limit certain calculations in quantum field theory resemble calculations in string theory.

=== Black holes and holography ===


In 1975, Stephen Hawking published a calculation that suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well-defined entropy. At first, Hawking&#x27;s result appeared to contradict one of the main postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction came to be known as the black hole information paradox.

Later, in 1993, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft wrote a speculative paper on quantum gravity in which he revisited Hawking&#x27;s work on black hole thermodynamics, concluding that the total number of degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the horizon. This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the holographic principle. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking&#x27;s work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.

=== Maldacena&#x27;s paper ===
On January 1, 1998, Juan Maldacena published a landmark paper that initiated the study of AdS/CFT. According to Alexander Markovich Polyakov, &quot;[Maldacena&#x27;s] work opened the flood gates.&quot; The conjecture immediately excited great interest in the string theory community and was considered in a paper by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov and Polyakov, and another paper of Edward Witten. These papers made Maldacena&#x27;s conjecture more precise and showed that the conformal field theory appearing in the correspondence lives on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space.

One special case of Maldacena&#x27;s proposal says that super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar in some ways to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of &#x27;t Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena&#x27;s results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena&#x27;s paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.

== Generalizations ==

=== Three-dimensional gravity ===

In order to better understand the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.

Beginning with the work of J. David Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, physicists have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.

=== dS/CFT correspondence ===

Unlike our universe, which is now known to be expanding at an accelerating rate, anti-de Sitter space is neither expanding nor contracting. Instead it looks the same at all times. In more technical language, one says that anti-de Sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative cosmological constant, whereas the real universe has a small positive cosmological constant.

Although the properties of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent of the value of the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space.

=== Kerr/CFT correspondence ===

Although the AdS/CFT correspondence is often useful for studying the properties of black holes, most of the black holes considered in the context of AdS/CFT are physically unrealistic. Indeed, as explained above, most versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence involve higher-dimensional models of spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.

In 2009, Monica Guica, Thomas Hartman, Wei Song, and Andrew Strominger showed that the ideas of AdS/CFT could nevertheless be used to understand certain astrophysical black holes. More precisely, their results apply to black holes that are approximated by extremal Kerr black holes, which have the largest possible angular momentum compatible with a given mass. They showed that such black holes have an equivalent description in terms of conformal field theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence was later extended to black holes with lower angular momentum.

=== Higher spin gauge theories ===

The AdS/CFT correspondence is closely related to another duality conjectured by Igor Klebanov and Alexander Markovich Polyakov in 2002. This duality states that certain &quot;higher spin gauge theories&quot; on anti-de Sitter space are equivalent to conformal field theories with O(N) symmetry. Here the theory in the bulk is a type of gauge theory describing particles of arbitrarily high spin. It is similar to string theory, where the excited modes of vibrating strings correspond to particles with higher spin, and it may help to better understand the string theoretic versions of AdS/CFT and possibly even prove the correspondence. In 2010, Simone Giombi and Xi Yin obtained further evidence for this duality by computing quantities called three-point functions.
