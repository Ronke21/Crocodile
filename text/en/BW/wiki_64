<text>Melbourne Robert Cranshaw (December 3, 1932 – November 2, 2016) was an American jazz bassist. His career spanned the heyday of Blue Note Records to his later involvement with the Musicians Union. He is perhaps best known for his long association with Sonny Rollins. Cranshaw performed in Rollins&#x27;s working band on and off for over five decades, starting with a live appearance at the 1959 Playboy jazz festival in Chicago and on record with the 1962 album &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

Cranshaw died at the age of 83 on November 2, 2016, in Manhattan, New York, from Stage IV cancer.

<text>Walter Davis Jr. (September 2, 1932 – June 2, 1990) was an American bebop and hard bop pianist.

Davis once left the music world to be a tailor, but returned. A soloist, bandleader, and accompanist, he amassed a body of work while never becoming a high-profile name even within the jazz community. Davis played with Babs Gonzales&#x27; Three Bips &amp; a Bop as a teen, then moved from Richmond to New York in the early 1950s. He played with Max Roach and Charlie Parker, recording with Roach in 1953.

He joined Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s band in 1956, and toured the Middle East and South America. He also played in Paris with Donald Byrd in 1958 and with Art Blakey &amp; the Jazz Messengers in 1959.

After retiring from music for a while to run his tailor shop, Davis returned in the 1960s, producing records and writing arrangements for a local New Jersey group. He studied music in India in 1979, and played with Sonny Rollins in the early 1970s.

==Biography==

Davis was born in Richmond, Virginia and raised in East Orange, New Jersey. His mother played gospel music and he had uncles who were pianists. As a teenager, he performed with Babs Gonzales in Newark. In the 1950s, Davis recorded with Melba Liston and Max Roach. He played with Roach, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. In 1958, he played with trumpeter Donald Byrd at Le Chat Qui Pêche in Paris and shortly after realized his dream of becoming pianist and composer-arranger for Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers. Davis married songwriter Mayme Watts, who was performing as a vocalist with the Walter Davis Jr. Trio.

Although he retired from music in the 1960s to work as a tailor, painter, and designer, he returned to his music career later that decade, and in the 1970s he performed with Sonny Rollins and again with the Jazz Messengers. He recorded with many other prominent jazz musicians, including Kenny Clarke, Sonny Criss, Jackie McLean, Pierre Michelot and Archie Shepp.

Davis was known as an interpreter of the music of Bud Powell, but also recorded an album capturing the compositional and piano style of Thelonious Monk. Several of his compositions served as titles for albums by Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers. Combining traditional harmonies with modal patterns and featuring numerous rhythmic shifts along with internal melodic motifs within operatic, aria-like sweeping melodies, Davis&#x27;s compositions included &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;, &quot;Backgammon&quot;, &quot;Uranus&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Folk Tales&quot;, &quot;Jodi&quot;, and &quot;Ronnie Is a Dynamite Lady&quot;.

Davis had an occasional role as the piano player on the CBS television comedy &quot;Frank&#x27;s Place&quot;. He also contributed to the soundtrack of the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Bird&quot; (1988).

==Death==
Davis died in New York City on June 2, 1990, aged 57, from complications of liver and kidney disease.

<text>Constantine the African, (; died before 1098/1099, Monte Cassino) was a physician who lived in the 11th century. The first part of his life was spent in Ifriqiya and the rest in Italy. He first arrived in Italy in the coastal town of Salerno, home of the Schola Medica Salernitana, where his work attracted attention from the local Lombard and Norman rulers. Constantine then became a Benedictine monk, living the last decades of his life at the abbey of Monte Cassino.

There is some debate about his birth and family religion, although it is well known that he ended his life as a monk at the Latin Christian Abbey of Monte Cassino, in southern Italy. This religious controversy suggested that he might born as Muslim, and after migration converted to catholic Christian, or he might born as Christian within an Arabic-speaking family. The native language of Constantine the African was Arabic. He was also fluent in Greek, Latin, and other languages, the skills he acquired during his extensive travels. His journey included Egypt, Syria, India, Ethiopia, and Persia. He was well-versed in medical knowledge before his arrival to Salerno in Italy where he joined the abbey of Monte Cassino south of Rome in 1077. 

It was in Italy where Constantine compiled his vast opus, mostly composed of translations from Arabic sources. He translated into Latin, books of the great masters of Arabic medicine: Razes, Ibn Imran, Ibn Suleiman, and Ibn al-Jazzar; these translations are housed today in libraries in Italy, Germany, France, Belgium, and England. They were used as textbooks from the Middle Ages to the seventeenth century.

==The historians of Constantine==
The 12th-century monk Peter the Deacon is the first historian to write a biography of Constantine. He noted that Constantine was a &quot;Saracen&quot;, the medieval Franco-Italian term for a Muslim from North Africa. According to Peter, Constantine traveled through Babylon, India, and Ethiopia, where he became versed in science, before coming to Monte Cassino as a refugee from peers in Carthage jealous of his knowledge. However, Peter&#x27;s legendary portrayal of Constantine has been questioned by some historians. Still, later historians such as Salvatore de Renzi and Charles Daremberg, curator of the National Library in Paris, and Leclerc, author of &quot;History of Arab Medicine&quot;, relied on this account. The German Moritz Steinscheider wrote a book dedicated to Constantine, which was printed in Berlin in 1865. German medical historian Karl Sudhoff created his Berber-Islamic thesis after discovering new and important documents touching on Constantine&#x27;s life and religion in the village of La Trinità della Cava , which he published in the journal &quot;Archeion&quot; in 1922.

==Emigration to Italy==

According to Karl Sudhoff, Constantine emigrated first to Italy as a merchant (mercator) in Sicily, moving to Salerno, where he was called Constantine Siculus. As Constantine spoke no Italian, a North African doctor named Abbas of Curiat, from an island lying off the city of Mahdia in Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia), became his interpreter. Suffering from an illness, he took refuge with the king&#x27;s brother Gusulf, where he noted that Abbas did not ask for the usual bottle of urine, and the doctor who came to examine him was inexperienced. After asking in vain to see any good Italian books on medicine, he concluded that medicine in Italy was limited to simple practical knowledge. Already having an extensive general knowledge, Constantine discovered a mission in life. 
After recovering, Constantine returned to Carthage in Ifriqiya, and practiced medicine for three years, collecting many books of medicine, then returned to southern Italy with his treasure. En route to Salerno he passed by the coast of Lucania by boat, where north of the Gulf of Polycastro a storm damaged some manuscripts, including the first three parts of the books of Ali Ibn Abbas Al Majoussi, which were lost. Arriving in Salerno with what remained of the books, Constantine converted to Christianity, then moved to Cassino, where he worked as an interpreter. The Sudhoff story ends with this event.

These are the parts borrowed and translated word-for-word from the study of Karl Sudhoff, a scientist who had a thorough knowledge of history and was renowned for reliable research. Although a trader, Constantine was learned, which is not surprising because education in the great mosque of the Zaytuna in Tunis and the homes of scientists was open to all. Trade between North Africa and Italy was flourishing, and did not cease during difficult times. North Africa had offices in various locations of Christian Sicily and southern Italy itself, including Bari, Taranto, Agripolis, and Gaglione.

North Africa exported olive oil, wax, leather, wool and derivatives, and imported wheat in famine years, and Islam did not prohibit trade with Christian countries.

==Scientific production==

Constantine arrived at Cassino, bringing with him the manuscripts of medicine that he took from Tunis. They include works of the Kairouanese El Baghdadi:
* The Kairouanese books
* The book of melancholy of Ishaq Ibn Imran.
* The book of the pulse, urine and food regime of Ibn Ishaq Suleiman.
* The book &quot;Zad Al Mussāfir&quot; (Viaticum) of Ahmed Ibn Al Jazzar.
* The Baghdadi books
* The book &quot;Al Hawi&quot; of Abu Bakr Al Razi
* The book &quot;Al Kamil “ of Ali Ibn Al Abbas Al Majoussi, at least in part. Constantine translated the first ten books (on the theory of medicine) but his translation of the second ten books (on practice) do not entirely survive. (The same book was retranslated in the twelfth century by Stephen of Antioch, who was dismissive of Constantine&#x27;s translation.)

==Editions of Constantine&#x27;s works==
Constantine&#x27;s works are most readily available in two sixteenth-century printed editions, the 1515 Lyons edition and the 1536 Basel edition. (Both editions are readily available online.) The Basel edition is missing some of Constantine&#x27;s prefatory material, but Mark Jordan notes that, while both Basel and Lyons editions are problematic, and have undergone some humanistic retouching, the Basel edition may be more reliable. Modern scholars of the history of medicine, however, have tended to refer to the Lyons edition.

A recent and scholarly edition of the &quot;De Coitu&quot; is &quot;Constantini Liber de Coitu = El tratado de andrología de Constantino el Africano&quot; (Santiago de Compostela: Secretariado de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Santiago, 1983), with accompanying Spanish translation.

The Isagoge of Johannitius, which Constantine may have translated (the attribution is contested), has been edited by Gregor Maurach in Sudhoffs Archiv 62 (1978). This edition was never meant to be definitive, and it has received some criticism and corrections, most notably by Ursula Weisser.

==English translations==

==The legend of Constantine==
In his introduction of the complete works of Ambroise Pare, here what Doctor Malgaigne writes: 
&quot;Constantine was born in Carthage and taken with an ardent desire to learn all sciences he went to Babylonia, learned grammar, logic, physics (medicine), geometry, arithmetic, mathematics, astronomy, necromancy, and music. After exhausting all sciences of the Chaldeans, Arabs and Persians he went to India, asked the scientists of this country, returned from Egypt where he completed his long study and after four decades of travel and work, he returned in his hometown. But the rarity and breadth of his knowledge scared his countrymen, they took him for a sorcerer and banished him. Constantine informed in time, fled and went to Salerno where he remained for some time hidden under the garb of a beggar. The brother of the king of Babylon who passes through this city, recognized him and presented him to the famous Robert Guiscard, who made him his first secretary. But more than eager to rest than with honors he left the court and retired to Monte Cassino where he spent the rest of his life translating from Arabic into Latin various medical books.&quot;

<doc id="649861" wikidata="Q9038" url="?curid=649861" title="Al-Khwarizmi">
<text>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (; ), or simply al-Khwarizmi, was a polymath who produced vastly influential Arabic-language works in mathematics, astronomy, and geography. Around 820, he worked at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, the contemporary capital city of the Abbasid Caliphate.

His popularizing treatise on algebra, compiled between 813–833 as &quot;Al-Jabr&quot; (&quot;The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing&quot;), presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations. One of his achievements in algebra was his demonstration of how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square, for which he provided geometric justifications. Because al-Khwarizmi was the first person to treat algebra as an independent discipline and introduced the methods of &quot;reduction&quot; and &quot;balancing&quot; (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation), he has been described as the father or founder of algebra. The English term &quot;algebra&quot; comes from the short-hand title of his aforementioned treatise ( , ). His name gave rise to the English terms &quot;algorism&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot;; the Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese terms ; and the Spanish term and Portuguese term , both meaning &#x27;digit&#x27;.

In the 12th century, Latin translations of al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s textbook on Indian arithmetic (), which codified the various Indian numerals, introduced the decimal-based positional number system to the Western world. Likewise, &quot;Al-Jabr&quot;, translated into Latin by the English scholar Robert of Chester in 1145, was used until the 16th century as the principal mathematical textbook of European universities.

Al-Khwarizmi revised &quot;Geography&quot;, the 2nd-century Greek-language treatise by the Roman polymath Claudius Ptolemy, listing the longitudes and latitudes of cities and localities. He further produced a set of astronomical tables and wrote about calendric works, as well as the astrolabe and the sundial. Al-Khwarizmi made important contributions to trigonometry, producing accurate sine and cosine tables and the first table of tangents.

== Life ==

Few details of al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s life are known with certainty. Ibn al-Nadim gives his birthplace as Khwarazm, and he is generally thought to have come from this region. Of Persian stock, his name means &#x27;from Khwarazm&#x27;, a region that was part of Greater Iran, and is now part of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

Al-Tabari gives his name as Muḥammad ibn Musá al-Khwārizmī al-Majūsī al-Quṭrubbullī (). The epithet &quot;al-Qutrubbulli&quot; could indicate he might instead have come from Qutrubbul (Qatrabbul), near Baghdad. However, Roshdi Rashed denies this:
On the other hand, David A. King affirms his nisba to Qutrubul, noting that he was called al-Khwārizmī al-Qutrubbulli because he was born just outside of Baghdad.

Regarding al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s religion, Toomer writes:

Ibn al-Nadīm&#x27;s includes a short biography on al-Khwārizmī together with a list of his books. Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work between 813 and 833. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, Baghdad had become the centre of scientific studies and trade. Around 820 CE, he was appointed as the astronomer and head of the library of the House of Wisdom. The House of Wisdom was established by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mūn. Al-Khwārizmī studied sciences and mathematics, including the translation of Greek and Sanskrit scientific manuscripts. He was also a historian who is cited by the likes of al-Tabari and Ibn Abi Tahir.

During the reign of al-Wathiq, he is said to have been involved in the first of two embassies to the Khazars. Douglas Morton Dunlop suggests that Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī might have been the same person as Muḥammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir, the eldest of the three Banū Mūsā brothers.

== Contributions ==
Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and cartography established the basis for innovation in algebra and trigonometry. His systematic approach to solving linear and quadratic equations led to &quot;algebra&quot;, a word derived from the title of his book on the subject, &quot;Al-Jabr&quot;.

&quot;On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals,&quot; written about 820, was principally responsible for spreading the Hindu–Arabic numeral system throughout the Middle East and Europe. When the work was translated into Latin in the 12th century as &quot;Algoritmi de numero Indorum&quot; (Al-Khwarizmi on the Hindu art of reckoning), the term &quot;algorithm&quot; was introduced to the Western world.

Some of his work was based on Persian and Babylonian astronomy, Indian numbers, and Greek mathematics.

Al-Khwārizmī systematized and corrected Ptolemy&#x27;s data for Africa and the Middle East. Another major book was &quot;Kitab surat al-ard&quot; (&quot;The Image of the Earth&quot;; translated as Geography), presenting the coordinates of places based on those in the &quot;Geography&quot; of Ptolemy, but with improved values for the Mediterranean Sea, Asia, and Africa.

He wrote on mechanical devices like the astrolabe and sundial. He assisted a project to determine the circumference of the Earth and in making a world map for al-Ma&#x27;mun, the caliph, overseeing 70 geographers. When, in the 12th century, his works spread to Europe through Latin translations, it had a profound impact on the advance of mathematics in Europe.

=== Algebra ===


&quot;Al-Jabr (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing&quot;, ) is a mathematical book written approximately 820 CE. It was written with the encouragement of Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun as a popular work on calculation and is replete with examples and applications to a range of problems in trade, surveying and legal inheritance. The term &quot;algebra&quot; is derived from the name of one of the basic operations with equations (, meaning &quot;restoration&quot;, referring to adding a number to both sides of the equation to consolidate or cancel terms) described in this book. The book was translated in Latin as &quot;Liber algebrae et almucabala&quot; by Robert of Chester (Segovia, 1145) hence &quot;algebra&quot;, and by Gerard of Cremona. A unique Arabic copy is kept at Oxford and was translated in 1831 by F. Rosen. A Latin translation is kept in Cambridge.

It provided an exhaustive account of solving polynomial equations up to the second degree, and discussed the fundamental method of &quot;reduction&quot; and &quot;balancing&quot;, referring to the transposition of terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.

Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s method of solving linear and quadratic equations worked by first reducing the equation to one of six standard forms (where &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are positive integers)
* squares equal roots (&quot;ax&quot;2 = &quot;bx&quot;)
* squares equal number (&quot;ax&quot;2 = &quot;c&quot;)
* roots equal number (&quot;bx&quot; = &quot;c&quot;)
* squares and roots equal number (&quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; = &quot;c&quot;)
* squares and number equal roots (&quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;c&quot; = &quot;bx&quot;)
* roots and number equal squares (&quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; = &quot;ax&quot;2)

by dividing out the coefficient of the square and using the two operations ( &quot;restoring&quot; or &quot;completion&quot;) and (&quot;balancing&quot;). is the process of removing negative units, roots and squares from the equation by adding the same quantity to each side. For example, &quot;x&quot;2 = 40&quot;x&quot; − 4&quot;x&quot;2 is reduced to 5&quot;x&quot;2 = 40&quot;x&quot;. is the process of bringing quantities of the same type to the same side of the equation. For example, &quot;x&quot;2 + 14 = &quot;x&quot; + 5 is reduced to &quot;x&quot;2 + 9 = &quot;x&quot;.

The above discussion uses modern mathematical notation for the types of problems that the book discusses. However, in al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s day, most of this notation had not yet been invented, so he had to use ordinary text to present problems and their solutions. For
example, for one problem he writes, (from an 1831 translation)

In modern notation this process, with &quot;x&quot; the &quot;thing&quot; ( &quot;shayʾ&quot;) or &quot;root&quot;, is given by the steps,
:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3

Let the roots of the equation be &quot;x&quot; = &quot;p&quot; and &quot;x = q&quot;. Then formula_4, formula_5 and
:formula_6
So a root is given by
:formula_7

Several authors have published texts under the name of , including Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī, Abū Kāmil, Abū Muḥammad al-&#x27;Adlī, Abū Yūsuf al-Miṣṣīṣī, &#x27;Abd al-Hamīd ibn Turk, Sind ibn &#x27;Alī, Sahl ibn Bišr, and Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī.

Solomon Gandz has described Al-Khwarizmi as the father of Algebra:
Victor J. Katz adds :
John J. O&#x27;Connor and Edmund F. Robertson wrote in the &quot;MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive&quot;:
Roshdi Rashed and Angela Armstrong write:
According to Swiss-American historian of mathematics, Florian Cajori, Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s algebra was different from the work of Indian mathematicians, for Indians had no rules like the &quot;restoration&quot; and &quot;reduction&quot;. Regarding the dissimilarity and significance of Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s algebraic work from that of Indian Mathematician Brahmagupta, Carl B. Boyer wrote: It is true that in two respects the work of al-Khowarizmi represented a retrogression from that of Diophantus. First, it is on a far more elementary level than that found in the Diophantine problems and, second, the algebra of al-Khowarizmi is thoroughly rhetorical, with none of the syncopation found in the Greek &quot;Arithmetica&quot; or in Brahmagupta&#x27;s work. Even numbers were written out in words rather than symbols! It is quite unlikely that al-Khwarizmi knew of the work of Diophantus, but he must have been familiar with at least the astronomical and computational portions of Brahmagupta; yet neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made use of syncopation or of negative numbers. Nevertheless, the &quot;Al-jabr&quot; comes closer to the elementary algebra of today than the works of either Diophantus or Brahmagupta, because the book is not concerned with difficult problems in indeterminant analysis but with a straight forward and elementary exposition of the solution of equations, especially that of second degree. The Arabs in general loved a good clear argument from premise to conclusion, as well as systematic organization – respects in which neither Diophantus nor the Hindus excelled.

=== Arithmetic ===
Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s second most influential work was on the subject of arithmetic, which survived in Latin translations but is lost in the original Arabic. His writings include the text &quot;kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī&quot; (&#x27;Book of Indian computation&#x27;), and perhaps a more elementary text, &quot;kitab al-jam&#x27; wa&#x27;l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī&quot; (&#x27;Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic&#x27;). These texts described algorithms on decimal numbers (Hindu–Arabic numerals) that could be carried out on a dust board. Called &quot;takht&quot; in Arabic (Latin: &quot;tabula&quot;), a board covered with a thin layer of dust or sand was employed for calculations, on which figures could be written with a stylus and easily erased and replaced when necessary. Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s algorithms were used for almost three centuries, until replaced by Al-Uqlidisi&#x27;s algorithms that could be carried out with pen and paper.

As part of 12th century wave of Arabic science flowing into Europe via translations, these texts proved to be revolutionary in Europe. Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s Latinized name, &quot;Algorismus&quot;, turned into the name of method used for computations, and survives in the term &quot;algorithm&quot;. It gradually replaced the previous abacus-based methods used in Europe.

Four Latin texts providing adaptions of Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s methods have survived, even though none of them is believed to be a literal translation:
* &quot;Dixit Algorizmi&quot; (published in 1857 under the title &quot;Algoritmi de Numero Indorum&quot;)
* &quot;Liber Alchoarismi de Practica Arismetice&quot;

&quot;Dixit Algorizmi&quot; (&#x27;Thus spake Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;) is the starting phrase of a manuscript in the University of Cambridge library, which is generally referred to by its 1857 title &quot;Algoritmi de Numero Indorum&quot;. It is attributed to the Adelard of Bath, who had translated the astronomical tables in 1126. It is perhaps the closest to Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s own writings.

Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s work on arithmetic was responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals, based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system developed in Indian mathematics, to the Western world. The term &quot;algorithm&quot; is derived from the algorism, the technique of performing arithmetic with Hindu-Arabic numerals developed by al-Khwārizmī. Both &quot;algorithm&quot; and &quot;algorism&quot; are derived from the Latinized forms of al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s name, &quot;Algoritmi&quot; and &quot;Algorismi&quot;, respectively.

=== Astronomy ===

Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s  (, &quot;astronomical tables of &quot;Siddhanta&quot;&quot;) is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. This is the first of many Arabic &quot;Zijes&quot; based on the Indian astronomical methods known as the &quot;sindhind&quot;. The word Sindhind is a corruption of the Sanskrit &quot;Siddhānta&quot;, which is the usual designation of an astronomical textbook. In fact, the mean motions in the tables of al-Khwarizmi are derived from those in the &quot;corrected Brahmasiddhanta&quot; (Brahmasphutasiddhanta) of Brahmagupta.

The work contains tables for the movements of the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. This work marked the turning point in Islamic astronomy. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge.

The original Arabic version (written ) is lost, but a version by the Spanish astronomer Maslama al-Majriti () has survived in a Latin translation, presumably by Adelard of Bath (26 January 1126). The four surviving manuscripts of the Latin translation are kept at the Bibliothèque publique (Chartres), the Bibliothèque Mazarine (Paris), the Biblioteca Nacional (Madrid) and the Bodleian Library (Oxford).
=== Trigonometry ===
Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s &quot;Zīj as-Sindhind&quot; contained tables for the trigonometric functions of sines and cosine. A related treatise on spherical trigonometry is attributed to him.

Al-Khwārizmī produced accurate sine and cosine tables, and the first table of tangents.

=== Geography ===

Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s third major work is his (, &quot;Book of the Description of the Earth&quot;), also known as his &quot;Geography&quot;, which was finished in 833. It is a major reworking of Ptolemy&#x27;s second-century &quot;Geography&quot;, consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction.

There is one surviving copy of , which is kept at the Strasbourg University Library. A Latin translation is at the Biblioteca Nacional de España in Madrid. The book opens with the list of latitudes and longitudes, in order of &quot;weather zones&quot;, that is to say in blocks of latitudes and, in each weather zone, by order of longitude. As Paul Gallez notes, this system allows the deduction of many latitudes and longitudes where the only extant document is in such a bad condition, as to make it practically illegible. Neither the Arabic copy nor the Latin translation include the map of the world; however, Hubert Daunicht was able to reconstruct the missing map from the list of coordinates. Daunicht read the latitudes and longitudes of the coastal points in the manuscript, or deduced them from the context where they were not legible. He transferred the points onto graph paper and connected them with straight lines, obtaining an approximation of the coastline as it was on the original map. He did the same for the rivers and towns.

Al-Khwārizmī corrected Ptolemy&#x27;s gross overestimate for the length of the Mediterranean Sea from the Canary Islands to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean; Ptolemy overestimated it at 63 degrees of longitude, while al-Khwārizmī almost correctly estimated it at nearly 50 degrees of longitude. He &quot;depicted the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as open bodies of water, not land-locked seas as Ptolemy had done.&quot; Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s Prime Meridian at the Fortunate Isles was thus around 10° east of the line used by Marinus and Ptolemy. Most medieval Muslim gazetteers continued to use al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s prime meridian.

=== Jewish calendar ===
Al-Khwārizmī wrote several other works including a treatise on the Hebrew calendar, titled (, &quot;Extraction of the Jewish Era&quot;). It describes the Metonic cycle, a 19-year intercalation cycle; the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month Tishrei shall fall; calculates the interval between the Anno Mundi or Jewish year and the Seleucid era; and gives rules for determining the mean longitude of the sun and the moon using the Hebrew calendar. Similar material is found in the works of Al-Bīrūnī and Maimonides. 

=== Other works ===
Ibn al-Nadim&#x27;s , an index of Arabic books, mentions al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s (), a book of annals. No direct manuscript survives; however, a copy had reached Nusaybin by the 11th century, where its metropolitan bishop, Mar Elias bar Shinaya, found it. Elias&#x27;s chronicle quotes it from &quot;the death of the Prophet&quot; through to 169 AH, at which point Elias&#x27;s text itself hits a lacuna.

Several Arabic manuscripts in Berlin, Istanbul, Tashkent, Cairo and Paris contain further material that surely or with some probability comes from al-Khwārizmī. The Istanbul manuscript contains a paper on sundials; the &quot;Fihrist&quot; credits al-Khwārizmī with (). Other papers, such as one on the determination of the direction of Mecca, are on the spherical astronomy.

Two texts deserve special interest on the morning width () and the determination of the azimuth from a height (). He wrote two books on using and constructing astrolabes.

<doc id="649863" wikidata="Q774916" url="?curid=649863" title="Pinetree Line">
<text>The Pinetree Line was a series of radar stations located across southern Canada at about the 50th parallel north, along with a number of other stations located on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Run by North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) (after its creation), over half were staffed by United States Air Force personnel with the balance operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. The line was the first coordinated system for early detection of a Soviet bomber attack on North America. Its radar technology quickly became outdated, and the line was in full operation only for a short time.

==History==

Plans for what would become the Pinetree Line were underway as early as 1946 within the Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD), a Canadian-U.S. organization. However, the costs of running such a system in the post-war era was too high, and instead Canada concentrated on the areas around Ontario and Quebec, while the United States set up stations in the Midwest and along the eastern seaboard.
With the successful test of an atomic bomb in the USSR, plans changed considerably. In 1949 Congress agreed to a $161 million construction program in co-operation with the RCAF, for a continuous line of stations across southern Canada. The USAF&#x27;s Continental Air Command and the RCAF met in October 1950 to start planning, and in January 1951 the PJBD presented &quot;Recommendation 51/1 for the Extension of the Continental Radar Defence System&quot;. The USAF later requested an additional set of six (potentially) mobile stations to provide low-level coverage. Later, it was learned the original radar systems performed better than expected, hence a number of the mobile sites were never deployed.

The system was eventually deployed as a series of 33 main stations and 6 smaller &quot;gap fillers&quot;. The majority of these ran in a line at about the 53rd parallel in the west (to offer coverage of major Canadian cities) and about the 50th parallel in the east. A second line ran up the eastern seaboard from the southern tip of Nova Scotia to the southern tip of Baffin Island. Of these, 22 of the main stations and all of the gap fillers were paid for by the USAF, leaving 11 to the RCAF. However 16 of the main stations were staffed by RCAF personnel. On 1 January 1955, the system was officially handed over to RCAF command, and over time an additional 10 stations were added. The stations on the east coast used the Pole Vault system for communication.

The Pinetree Line had several technical problems that limited its usefulness almost immediately. For one, the system used a simple pulse radar technique, which made it unable to detect targets close to the ground due to radar clutter as well as being trivially easy to jam using the recently-introduced carcinotron tube. Another was that its location near population centres meant it offered only a last minute warning, and as the USSR moved to jet-powered bombers the warning time was reduced. Studies were already underway in 1951 to build a series of Doppler bistatic radar stations somewhat farther north, which would develop into the Mid-Canada Line. By 1957, just over a year after the Mid-Canada Line was operational, a more advanced long-range search radar, mainly in the Canadian north and Alaska were deployed comprising the Distant Early Warning Line.

The Pinetree stations were kept operational during this period, and most underwent modifications as a part of the deployment of the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE). SAGE dramatically reduced the workload at the stations, cutting staff requirements by well over half. By the later 1950s some were being mothballed as newer systems came on line to the north. Nevertheless, many of the Pinetree stations were kept operational into the 1980s, particularly on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

<doc id="649865" wikidata="Q2630723" url="?curid=649865" title="Raglan Castle">
<text>Raglan Castle () is a late medieval castle located just north of the village of Raglan in the county of Monmouthshire in south east Wales. The modern castle dates from between the 15th and early 17th centuries, when the successive ruling families of the Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent. Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales.

During the First English Civil War, Raglan was occupied by a Royalist garrison on behalf of Charles I but was taken by Parliamentarian forces in 1646 and its walls slighted, or deliberately put beyond military use. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, the Somersets declined to restore it and it became first a source of local building materials, then a romantic ruin. It is now a tourist attraction.

==History==

===Early history of the castle===
Following the Norman invasion of Wales, the area around the village of Raglan was granted to William FitzOsbern, the Earl of Hereford. Some historians, such as John Kenyon, suspect that an early motte and bailey castle may have been built on the Raglan site during this period: the location had strategic importance and archaeologists have discovered the remains of a possible bailey ditch on the site. The local manor was held by the Bloet family from the late 12th century until the late 14th century, and the family built a manor house somewhere on the site during this period, surrounded by a park. By the late medieval period the Raglan site was surrounded by the large deer parks of Home Park and Red Deer Park, the latter being enclosed at the end of the period.

===15th to 16th centuries===
The current Raglan Castle was begun by Sir William ap Thomas, the lesser son of a minor Welsh family who rose through the ranks of mid-15th century politics, profiting from the benefits of the local offices he held. William married first Elizabeth, a wealthy heiress, and then Gwladus, another heiress who would prove to be a powerful regional figure in her own right. In 1432, Sir William purchased the manor of Raglan, where he had already been staying as a tenant, for 1,000 marks (£666 13s 4d) and commenced a programme of building work that established the basic shape of the castle as seen today, although most of it—with the exception of the South Gate and the Great Tower—was later built over.

Sir William&#x27;s son dropped the Welsh version of his name, calling himself William Herbert. He continued to rise in prominence, supporting the House of York during the War of the Roses, fighting in the Hundred Years War in France but making his fortune from the Gascon wine trade. He was also closely associated with Welsh politics and status; he was the first Welshman to be made an earl and was described by contemporary poets as the &quot;national deliverer&quot; who might achieve Welsh independence. In the 1460s William used his increasing wealth to remodel Raglan on a much grander scale. The symbolism of the castle architecture may have reflected the Welsh family roots: historian Matthew Johnson has suggested that the polygonal towers were possibly designed to imitate those of Caernarfon Castle, whose architecture carries numerous allusions to the eventual return of a Roman Emperor to Wales. Historian Anthony Emery has described the resulting castle as one of the &quot;last formidable displays of medieval defensive architecture&quot;.

There was an important link between Raglan Castle and the surrounding parkland, in particular the Home Park and the Red Deer Park. Historian Robert Liddiard suggests that on the basis of the views from the castle at this time, the structured nature of the parks would have contrasted with the wilderness of the mountain peaks framing the scene beyond, making an important statement about the refinement and cultured nature of the castle lord. In the 15th century there were also extensive orchards and fish ponds surrounding the castle, favourably commented upon by contemporaries.
William Herbert was executed as a Yorkist supporter in 1469 after the Battle of Edgecote Moor. Building work may have stopped for a period under his son, also called William Herbert, before recommencing in the late 1470s. By 1492, the castle passed to Elizabeth Somerset, William Herbert&#x27;s daughter, who married Sir Charles Somerset, passing the castle into a new family line.

Sir Charles Somerset was politically successful under both Henry VII and Henry VIII, being made the Earl of Worcester. His son, Henry Somerset, died shortly after inheriting Raglan, but not before using lead reclaimed from Tintern Abbey to help the building work at Raglan Castle during the dissolution of the monasteries. His son and grandson, William Somerset and Edward Somerset, proved to be what John Kenyon describes as &quot;wealthy, brilliant and cultured men&quot;. William rebuilt much of the Pitched Stone Court, including the hall, adding the Long Gallery and developing the gardens into the new Renaissance style. The Somerset family owned two key castles in the region, Raglan and Chepstow, and these appeared to have figured prominently as important status symbols in paintings owned by the family.

===17th century===
Edward Somerset made minor improvements to the interior of the castle at the start of the 17th century, but focused primarily on the exterior, expanding and developing the gardens and building the moat walk around the Great Tower. The resulting gardens were considered the equal of any others in the kingdom at the time.

Upon inheriting Raglan in 1628, Henry Somerset, then the 5th Earl of Worcester, continued to live a grand lifestyle in the castle in the 1630s, with a host of staff, including a steward, Master of Horse, Master of Fishponds, surveyors, auditors, ushers, a falconer and many footmen. The interior walls were hung with rich tapestries from Arras in France, while an inventory taken in 1639 recorded a large number of silver and gilt plate kept in the Great Tower, including an ostrich egg cup, and a silver basket for oranges and lemons, then luxury items in Wales. Mead was a popular drink in the castle, but contemporaries described the castle as being a particular sober and respectful community. Henry developed the entrance route to the castle, including building the Red Gate. His son Edward, Lord Herbert became famous for building a &quot;water commanding machine&quot; in the Great Tower, which used steam to pump a huge spout of water high into the air from the moat.

In August 1642 the First English Civil War began between Royalist supporters of Charles I and Parliament. Raglan Castle was still held by Henry, then an elderly man, supported by his son, Lord Herbert. Both men were firm royalists. King Charles sent his own son, Prince Charles, on a fund-raising tour of friendly regions, starting with Raglan Castle in October 1642, following which Henry was promoted to be the first Marquess of Worcester. Tensions grew in the immediate region, partially driven by religious tensions between some of the more Protestant local people and the Roman Catholic Marquess; on one of these occasions a local group attempted to search the castle, but were reportedly driven away by the sudden noise of Lord Herbert&#x27;s steam-engine. The defences of Raglan were improved after this, with modern earthwork bastions built around the castle and a powder mill created; a garrison of around 300 men was established at a cost of £40,000. Heavier cannon were installed in the bastions, with lighter pieces placed in the castle towers.

Lord Herbert left the castle to join the campaign against Parliament, returning at intervals to acquire more funds for the war. Charles I himself visited the castle twice, first in June 1645 after the battle of Naseby and again in 1646, when he enjoyed playing bowls on the castle&#x27;s green. The Royalist cause was now close to military collapse, and the Marquess started to send some valuables, including the oak panelling from the parlour, some plaster ceiling and many pictures, to his brother at nearby Troy House for safe-keeping. Lord Herbert was captured in Ireland, and an attack on Raglan itself appeared imminent.

In expectation of a siege, the castle garrison was increased to around 800 soldiers; the avenue of trees outside the castle gates were cut down, and neighbouring buildings destroyed to prevent their being used by Parliamentary forces. Large amounts of food were brought in to support the growing castle community, which also included a number of the wider Herbert family and other regional Royalist leaders who had sought shelter there. The first Parliamentary army arrived in early June, under the command of Colonel Morgan and Sir Trevor Williams. After several calls for the castle to surrender, a siege ensued, lasting through the summer months. In August, additional Parliamentarian forces under General Fairfax arrived, and calls for the castle to surrender were renewed. Fairfax&#x27;s men began to dig trenches towards the castle, and used these to move mortars forward, probably including the famous &quot;Roaring Meg&quot;, bringing the interior of the castle into artillery range. Facing a hopeless situation, the Marquess surrendered the castle on 19 August on relatively generous terms for the garrison. The Marquess himself was arrested and sent to Windsor Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Informed shortly before his death that Parliament had granted his request to be buried in the family vault at Windsor, the Marquess remarked; &quot;Why then I shall have a better castle when I am dead, than they took from me when alive.&quot;

Fairfax ordered the castle to be totally destroyed under the supervision of Henry Herbert, a descendant of William ap Thomas. The fortifications proved too strong, however, and only a few of the walls were destroyed, or slighted. Historian Matthew Johnson describes the event as having the atmosphere of a &quot;community festival&quot;, as local people dredged the castle moat in search of treasure, and emptied the fishponds of valuable carp. The castle&#x27;s library, including an important collection of Welsh documents and books, was either stolen or destroyed.

Despite some immediate confiscations after the siege, by the time of the Restoration of Charles II, the Somerset family had managed to recover most of their possessions, including Raglan Castle. Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquess, decided to prioritise the rebuilding of his other houses at Troy and Badminton, rather than Raglan, reusing some of the property sent away for safety before the war, or salvaged after the slighting.

===18th to 21st centuries===
For the first half of the 18th century, the castle continued to deteriorate, with the Somerset family allowing their stewards to quarry stone from the castle for the repair of other estate buildings. One particular estate surveyor called Hopkins became known as the &quot;Grand Dilapidator&quot;, due to the number of chimneys, window frames and staircases he had removed from the castle. Henry Somerset, the 5th Duke, finally put an end to this practice in 1756, and the castle became a tourist attraction, part of the popular Wye Tour. Seats, fences and bridges were installed, and the first guidebook to the site was published in the early 19th century. 
The Great Hall was temporarily re-roofed in the 1820s, when the castle was used for a &quot;Grand Entertainment&quot; by the Somersets, and in 1830 Jeffrey Wyattville was employed to reinstate the Grand Staircase. The Monmouthshire antiquarian Joseph Bradney recorded a visit to the castle by Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, then Prince and Princess of Wales, in October 1881. In 1938 Henry Somerset, the 10th Duke, entrusted guardianship of Raglan Castle to the Commissioner of Works, and the castle became a permanent tourist attraction. Today, the castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument, administered by Cadw. Between 2003 and 2007 Cambrian Archaeological Projects led excavations at the castle in advance of a planned new visitor centre.

==Architecture==
Raglan Castle was built in several phases, initial work occurring in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions at the end of the 16th century. The castle was built in stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family&#x27;s own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.

There has been much discussion amongst academics about the extent to which Raglan was influenced by contemporary French designs; one school of thought suggests that it was heavily influenced by designs that were then popular in the south of France; others oppose this &quot;diffusionist&quot; school of thought, and argue that there is insufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion. Another line of debate has been over the nature of the castle&#x27;s defences, in particular its gunloops. Many castles built around the same time as Raglan appear to have been built with less concern for defences than in the past, their military features more symbolic than real. At Raglan, there are numerous gunloops throughout the castle&#x27;s defences, but many were ill-placed if the intention was to use them in a conflict; some could barely have been used at all. Traditionally, an evolutionary explanation for this was given: Raglan&#x27;s gunloops were of an early period, later surpassed in other castles. More recent explanations emphasise the prestigious symbolism of gunloops for the Herbert family when they built the castle, even if many might have been impossible to use. Anthony Emery notes that Raglan&#x27;s gunloops were better sited than many at the time, and at least &quot;the owner was up to date in his symbolism&quot;; Robert Liddiard suggests that the poor placing of some of the gunloops for aesthetic purposes might have actually been a conversation point for those visitors with experience of fighting in France and the &quot;correct&quot; placing of such defences.

===Gatehouse and Closet Tower===
The three-storey gatehouse to Raglan Castle dates from the 1460s and is approached over a stone bridge restored in 1949. Characterised by extensive machicolations and gunloops, the gatehouse would originally have had a twin-set of portcullises and a drawbridge. The intention of the design was at least partially defensive, but was also intended to provide a dramatic and impressive entrance for senior visitors to the castle. The upper part of the gatehouse provided chambers for the constable of the castle. Immediately to the west of the gatehouse was the castle library, once famous for its collection of Welsh literature. On the east side of the gatehouse is the three-storey Closet Tower; this was designed to be integral to the gatehouse, and may have contained the original castle treasury, conveniently accessible by the constable. The Closet Tower was partly altered in later years, possibly to allow the basement to be used as a magazine in the English Civil War.

===Pitched Stone Court and Fountain Court===
The Pitched Stone Court forms the north-east corner of the castle, and provided a centre for the castle services and servants; it takes its name from the late-Tudor cobbling, or pitched stones. On the east side of the court is the former office wing, a 16th-century construction mostly destroyed during the siege of 1646. The castle kitchens and pantries are on the north side, containing two large fireplaces and storage facilities for food and supplies in their cellars. In the 1460s, the first floors to these buildings included chambers for the senior servants. The buttery in the north-west corner would have been used to store and serve beer and wine.

On the south-west side of the court is the hall, a 16th-century design incorporating an earlier hall on the same site. wide, the hall was originally high, with a roof made of Irish oak, lit and ventilated by a cupola in the middle. A large oriel window lit the end of the hall occupied at dinner by the earls of Worcester, which by the time Raglan was built would have been used only for larger formal occasions. Originally, the hall would have been fitted with carved wooden panelling and a minstrel&#x27;s gallery.
The Fountain Court lies to the west of the Pitched Stone Court, and is named after a marble fountain that once stood in the centre of it, featuring a white horse on a black marble base, complete with a flow of running water. The fountain was probably installed somewhat after the initial construction of the court in the 1460s, dating instead to Edward Somerset in the late 16th century; the horse symbolised Edward&#x27;s prestigious role as Master of the Horse. The Fountain Court was built to provide luxurious accommodation for the family and guests—by the 15th century, it was important to be able to provide private chambers for visitors, and this court could hold up to four distinct groups of visitors in comfort. The Fountain Court as a whole is marked by what Augustus Pugin described as extremely fine, elegant and delicate stonework.

The castle chapel runs alongside the east side of the court, long and originally laid with bright yellow and tiles and decorated with gold and silver vestments. The Long Gallery stretches across the whole east first-floor of the Fountain Court and, although now ruined, would have been a show-piece for the earls&#x27; wealth and power. The gallery was long and during the Tudor period it would have been wood-panelled throughout and lined with tapestries and paintings. The Long Gallery was intended to allow family and guests to relax inside and to admire the gardens, water gardens and the deer park to the north of the castle. Although most of this decoration has since been lost, two caryatid statues can still be seen on the walls of the Long Gallery, modelled on a work by the French artist Hugues Sambin.

The west side of the Fountain Court comprises the apartments, with a number of bay windows and window seats facing west and north across the park. The Grand Staircase divides the apartments; restored between 2010 and 2011, the staircase would originally have had a substantial porch, similar to the one that survives in the Pitched Stone Court, and would have been a centre-piece of the Fountain Court. Although examples of such straight-flight staircases can be found in other late-medieval buildings, the architectural historian John Newman considers the Grand Staircase had &quot;a grandeur hard to parallel in 15th-century England.&quot; The apartments to the west of the staircase are more complex than the others, designed to create somewhat greater privacy, and overlooked the gardens to the west of the castle. On the south side of the court is the South Gate, the original entrance to the castle prior to the 1460s reconstruction. The fan-vaulted gatehouse closely resembles the contemporary cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral, but by the 16th century had been converted to the entrance to the bowling green in the terrace beyond.

On the south-east side of the court were the 16th-century parlour on the first-floor, and the dining room above it—both . These were intended to provide rooms that were more private than the main hall, but more public than a personal chamber. Now ruined, they would originally have been decorated with carved wainscoting and elaborate, carved chimney-pieces. Alongside these rooms, overlooking the Great Tower, were the private rooms for the lord&#x27;s family, of higher quality than the other accommodation in the castle. Some of the carved badges and shields on the external walls of these state apartments still remain intact, as in the hall; these were a popular contemporary feature of 15th-century great castles, and would have created a similar effect to those at Warkworth Castle in Northumberland and Raby Castle in County Durham.

===Great Tower===
The Great Tower at Raglan Castle, sometimes called the Yellow Tower of Gwent, sits outside the rest of the castle, protected by a moat and linked to the Fountain Court by a bridge. The fortification is representative of a trend during the 15th and 16th centuries in British castle building: tower keeps such as this, large, solid buildings designed for private accommodation, probably inspired by those in France, had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth. In the 15th century the fashion spread, with the creation of French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps, such as those at Wardour and Tattershall. These were expensive buildings to construct, each built to a unique design and, as historian Norman Pounds has suggested, &quot;were designed to allow very rich men to live in luxury and splendour&quot;.

The hexagonal Great Tower was probably begun in the 1430s and 1440s, possibly on the motte of a previous castle. The tower today has lost not only one of its walls but part of its upper structure, and would originally have been three storeys high with probably additional machicolations on top similar to those on the gatehouse. It was designed to be a self-contained fortification, with its own water and food supplies, and luxurious quarters lit by large windows on the upper floors. Originally the tower was reached by a bascule drawbridge, usually considered to be drawn from contemporary French designs, such as those at Ferté-Milon and Vannes. This drawbridge was designed to have two parts—a wide, heavy bridge that would be raised or lowered when the family was in residence, and a thinner bridge, easier to lift, designed for the use of servants at other times. The Herberts used the bridge as their badge, and it can be seen in the carved window designs around the castle. The drawbridge was replaced with a grander stone bridge in the 1460s, probably at a cost of around £900 to £1000. An apron wall with six turrets was also added around the tower at around the same time.

The original moat around the tower would have been a simple design, but it was redesigned in the 1460s to provide a walkway around the outside of the Great Tower. The niches in the walls of the walkway are of 17th-century origin, and would originally have held classical statues—the walkway would have provided a dignified way of admiring the Great Tower. It is likely that fish would have been bred in the moat.

===Landscape and gardens===

The former 16th- and 17th-century gardens of Raglan Castle are still visible in the form of several long terraces to the north of the castle, overlooking the lower ground beyond. First created in the second half of the 16th century, these terraces would originally have included a number of knot gardens, probably with Italianate sculpture and carved stone balustrades. The gardens at their peak would have probably resembled those at Nonsuch Palace, where the Somersets also had an interest as the royal keepers. The valley below retains some signs of the drainage ditches that once formed part of the water gardens that flooded the bottom of the site, although the original &quot;water-parterre&quot; to the north-west of the castle, another water garden in the south, and the extensive gardens around the south-west of the castle are now no longer visible. The castle&#x27;s bowling green still survives, on a terrace just beyond the South Gate entrance. The castle&#x27;s parks reverted to agricultural use by the 19th century, and Raglan is now surrounded by fields. The gardens and park at Raglan are designated Grade I on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

<text>Saint Petersburg State University (SPBGU; ) is a public research university in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Russia. Founded in 1724 by a decree of Peter the Great, the university from the beginning has had a focus on fundamental research in science, engineering and humanities.

During the Soviet period, it was known as Leningrad State University (). It was renamed after Andrei Zhdanov in 1948 and was officially called &quot;Leningrad State University, named after A. A. Zhdanov and decorated with the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.&quot; Zhdanov&#x27;s was removed in 1989 and Leningrad in the name was officially replaced with Saint Petersburg in 1992.

It is made up of 24 specialized faculties (departments) and institutes, the Academic Gymnasium, the Medical College, the College of Physical Culture and Sports, Economics and Technology. The university has two primary campuses: one on Vasilievsky Island and the other one in Peterhof.

==Admissions==
Admission to Saint Petersburg State University is extremely competitive. Undergraduate admissions for domestic state funded students are decided through the Unified State Exam. The average Unified State Examination score of applicants to the university in 2023 was around 90 points (out of a possible 100). In the 2023 admission campaign, over 106,000 domestic students applied to the university for bachelor&#x27;s and specialist programs, with only 4,617 being accepted. The same year, over 21,000 international students from 100 different countries applied to the university for state-funded scholarship programs, with only 1,000 being accepted. This reflects an overall acceptance rate of around 4% for both domestic students and international students studying on scholarships.

==Rankings==
In international rankings, the university was ranked 35th by &quot;The Three University Missions Ranking&quot; in 2022, 242nd by the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; in 2022, 652nd by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2023, 601-800th by the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;, and 301–400th by the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; in 2021.

==History==

===1724–1821===
It is disputed by the university administration whether Saint Petersburg State University or Moscow State University is the oldest higher education institution in Russia. While the latter was established in 1755, the former, which has been in continuous operation since 1819, claims to be the successor of the university established along with the Academic Gymnasium and the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences on 24 January 1724, by a decree of Peter the Great.

Between 1804 and 1819, Saint Petersburg University officially did not exist; the institution founded by Peter the Great, the Saint Petersburg Academy, had been disbanded, because the new 1803 charter of the Academy of Sciences stipulated that there should not be any educational institutions affiliated with it.

The Petersburg Pedagogical Institute, renamed the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1814, was established in 1804 and occupied a part of the Twelve Collegia building. On 8 February 1819 (O.S.), Alexander I of Russia reorganized the Main Pedagogical Institute into Saint Petersburg University, which at that time consisted of three faculties: Faculty of Philosophy and Law, Faculty of History and Philology and Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. The Main Pedagogical Institute (where Dmitri Mendeleev studied) was restored in 1828 as an educational institution independent of Saint Petersburg University, and trained teachers until it was finally closed in 1859.

===1821–1917===
In 1821, the university was renamed Saint Petersburg Imperial University. In 1823, most of the university moved from the Twelve Collegia to the southern part of the city. In 1824, a modified version of the charter of Moscow University was adopted as the first charter of the Saint Petersburg Imperial University. In 1829, there were 19 full professors and 169 full-time and part-time students at the university. In 1830, Tsar Nicholas returned the entire building of the Twelve Collegia to the university, and courses resumed there.

In 1835, a new Charter of the Imperial Universities of Russia was approved. It provided for the establishment of the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of History and Philology, and the Faculties of Physics and Mathematics, which were merged into the Faculty of Philosophy as the 1st and 2nd Departments, respectively.

In 1849, after the Spring of Nations, the Senate of the Russian Empire decreed the Rector should be appointed by the Minister of National Enlightenment rather than elected by the Assembly of the university. However, Pyotr Pletnyov was reappointed Rector and ultimately became the longest-serving rector of Saint Petersburg University (1840–61).


In 1855, Oriental studies were separated from the Faculty of History and Philology, and the fourth faculty, Faculty of Oriental Languages, was formally inaugurated on 27 August 1855.

In 1859–61, female part-time students could attend lectures in the university. In 1861, there were 1,270 full-time and 167 part-time students in the university, of them 498 were in the Faculty of Law, the largest subdivision. But this subdivision had the cameral studies department, where students learnt safety, occupational health and environmental engineering management and science, including chemistry, biology, agronomy along with law and philosophy. Many Russian, Georgian etc. managers, engineers and scientists studied at the Faculty of law therefore. During 1861–62, there was student unrest in the university, and it was temporarily closed twice during the year. The students were denied freedom of assembly and placed under police surveillance, and public lectures were forbidden. Many students were expelled. After the unrest, in 1865 only 524 students remained.

A decree of the Emperor Alexander II of Russia adopted on 18 February 1863, restored the right of the university assembly to elect the rector. It also formed the new faculty of the theory and history of art as part of the faculty of history and philology.

In March 1869, student unrest shook the university again, but on a smaller scale. By 1869, 2,588 students had graduated from the university.

In 1880, the Ministry of National Enlightenment forbade students to marry and married persons could not be admitted. In 1882, another student unrest took place in the university. In 1884, a new Charter of the Imperial Russian Universities was adopted, which granted the right to appoint the rector to the Minister of National Enlightenment again. On 1 March 1887 (O.S.), a group of the university students was arrested while planning an attempt on the life of Alexander III of Russia. As a result, new admission rules to gymnasiums and universities were approved by the Minister of National Enlightenment Ivan Delyanov in 1887, which barred persons of non-noble origin from admission to the university, unless they were extraordinarily talented.

By 1894, 9,212 students had graduated from the university. Among the scholars of the second half of the 19th century, affiliated with the university were mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, physicist Heinrich Lenz, chemists Dmitri Mendeleev and Aleksandr Butlerov, embryologist Alexander Kovalevsky, physiologist Ivan Sechenov and pedologist Vasily Dokuchaev. On 24 March 1896 (O.S.), on the campus of the university, Alexander Popov publicly demonstrated transmission of radio waves for the first time in history.

As of 1 January 1900 (O.S.), there were 2,099 students enrolled in the Faculty of Law, 1,149 students in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, 212 students in the Faculty of Oriental Languages and 171 students in the Faculty of History and Philology. In 1902, the first student dining hall in Russia was opened in the university.

Since about 1897, regular strikes and student unrest shook the university and spread to other institutions of higher education across Russia. During the Revolution of 1905, the charter of the Russian universities was amended once more; the autonomy of the universities was partially restored and the right to elect the rector was returned to the academic board for the first time since 1884. In 1905–06, the university was temporarily closed due to student unrest. Its autonomy was revoked again in 1911. In the same year, the university was once again temporarily closed.

In 1914, with the start of the First World War, the university was renamed Petrograd Imperial University after its namesake city. During the War, the university was the center of mobilization of Russian intellectual resources and scholarship for the war effort. In 1915, a branch of the university was opened in Perm, which later became Perm State University.

===1918–1939===
The Assembly of Petrograd Imperial University openly welcomed the February Revolution of 1917, which put an end to the Russian monarchy, and the university came to be known as Petrograd University. However, after the October Revolution of 1917, the university&#x27;s staff and administration were initially vocally opposed to the Bolshevik takeover of power and reluctant to cooperate with the Narkompros. Later in 1917–22, during the Russian Civil War, some of the staff suspected of counter-revolutionary sympathies suffered imprisonment (e.g., Lev Shcherba in 1919), execution, or exile abroad on the so-called Philosophers&#x27; ships in 1922 (e.g., Nikolai Lossky). Furthermore, the entire staff suffered from hunger and extreme poverty during those years.

In 1918, the university was renamed 1st Petrograd State University, and in 1919 the Narkompros merged it with the 2nd PSU (former Psychoneurological Institute) and 3rd PSU (former Bestuzhev Higher Courses for Women) into Petrograd State University. In 1919, the Faculty of Social Science was established by the Narkompros instead of the Faculty of History and Philology, Faculty of Oriental Languages and Faculty of Law. Nicholas Marr became the first Dean of the new faculty. Chemist Alexey Favorsky became the Dean of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. Rabfaks and free university courses were opened on the basis of the university to provide mass education.

In the fall of 1920, as observed by freshman student Alice Rosenbaum (Ayn Rand), enrollment was open and the majority of the students were anti-communist including, until removed, a few vocal opponents of the regime. Seeing they were educating &quot;class enemies&quot;, a purge was conducted in 1922 based on the class background of the students, and all students, other than seniors, with a bourgeois background were expelled.

In 1924, the university was renamed Leningrad State University after its namesake city. In order to suppress intellectual opposition to Soviet power, a number of historians working in the university, including Sergey Platonov, Yevgeny Tarle, and Boris Grekov, were imprisoned in the so-called Academic Affair of 1929–30 on fabricated charges of participating in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the government. Some other members of the staff were repressed in 1937–38 during the Great Purge.

===1940–1999===
During the 1941–44 Siege of Leningrad in World War II, many students and staff died from starvation, in battles, or from repressions. The university evacuated to Saratov in 1942–44. A branch of the university was in Yelabuga during the war. In 1944, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union awarded the university the Order of Lenin. In 1948, the Soviet Council of Ministers named the university after Andrei Zhdanov, a deceased Communist official. This decision was revoked in 1989 during Perestroika.

In 1949–50, several professors died in prison during the investigation of the Leningrad Affair fabricated by the central Soviet leadership, and the Minister of Education of the RSFSR, former rector Alexander Voznesensky, was executed.

In 1966, the Council of Ministers decided to build a suburban campus in Petrodvorets for most of the mathematics and natural science faculties. The relocation of the faculties was completed by the 1990s. In 1969, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union awarded the university the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In 1991, the university was renamed back to Saint Petersburg State University after its namesake city. The university educated Russian presidents Vladimir Putin and Dimitry Medvedev, both of whom studied law at the university.

=== 2000–present ===
Rector Nikolay Kropachev has signed a letter of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In early 2022, the university expelled 13 students who had protested against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In response to the Russian invasion, in March 2022 the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and University of Bremen suspended their longstanding relationships with the university, Dartmouth College stopped running its Russian language study abroad program in the university, and CEMS - The Global Alliance in Management Education suspended its partnership with the Graduate School of Management in St Petersburg. In addition, the European Coimbra Group expelled the university, and the European University Association suspended the school. The Council on International Educational Exchange stopped its programs at the university, and relocated students to other non-Russian universities.

==Organization==
===Governance===
The university is a federal state institution of higher education managed by the government of the Russian Federation. It has 24 faculties and institutes which are further subdivided into departments, and other main structural subdivisions.

The superior body of self-government of the university is its Assembly, which elects the rector and the Academic Board of the university for a five-year term. The Assembly consists of the members of the Academic Board of the university and the staff delegated by the general assemblies of the main structural subdivisions according to quotas set by the Academic Board of the university. The general administration of the university is vested in the Academic Board, which consists of the rector, who presides over it, as well as the president of the university, vice rectors and representatives of the main structural subdivisions.

Likewise, the general administration of a faculty is vested in its respective academic board elected by the faculty assembly for five years. The procedure of election and department quotas are decided by the faculty-level academic board itself. The dean, who leads the faculty and presides over its academic board, is elected for five years by the faculty academic board.

===Academic year===
The academic year in St. Petersburg State University according to the Routine Regulations normally starts on 1 September. One lesson normally lasts an hour and a half (two academic hours). The academic year is divided into two semesters. The first semester (term) ends by late December, the second starts in mid-February and lasts until late May. Each term is followed by a series of preliminary tests (in the last week of December/May) and exams (in January/June).

===Campuses===
The university has two main campuses: on Vasilievsky Island in the historic city center and in Peterhof (formerly Petrodvorets), a southwestern suburb, which can be reached by railway from the city&#x27;s Baltiysky Rail Terminal. The main building of the university, Twelve Collegia, is on Vasilievsky Island and includes the Library, the Faculty of Biology and the Institute of Earth Sciences. The Faculty of Philology and the Faculty of Oriental Studies share the nearby 18th-century Petrine Baroque building on Universitetskaya Embankment of the Bolshaya Neva, designed by Domenico Trezzini and originally built as the Palace of Peter II of Russia. The New Gostiny Dvor designed by Giacomo Quarenghi and built in the 19th century in that part of the island is occupied by the Institute of History, Institute of Philosophy. The Faculty of Psychology is in front of it on Admiral Makarov Embankment of the Malaya Neva. The Graduate School of Management, School of Journalism and Mass Communications, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and Medical Technologies, Faculty of Law and Faculty of Military Studies are on Vasilievsky Island, but farther to the west. Four other social science faculties are east of the city center on the southern bank of the Neva: the Faculty of Economics is not far from the Chernyshevskaya metro station, while the Faculty of Sociology, Faculty of Political Science and the School of International Relations occupy historical buildings of Smolny Convent.

The new suburban campus consists of the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Control Processes, Institute of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics, and Faculty of Physics, which are in modern buildings in Peterhof. Nearby the Peterhof campus there is a park area called Sergievka. In the Sergievka park there are buildings of the Faculty of Biology.

The ERL KLIA Transit is a commuter rail service which serves as an airport rail link to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia. It runs from KL Sentral, the main railway station of Kuala Lumpur to KLIA&#x27;s Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. The line is one of the two services on the Express Rail Link (ERL) system, sharing the same tracks as the KLIA Ekspres. KLIA Transit stops at all stations along the line, whereas KLIA Ekspres runs an express, non-stop service between KL Sentral and the airport. The line is operated by Express Rail Link Sdn. Bhd. (ERL).

The line is one of the components of the [[Klang Valley Integrated Transit System]]. It is numbered 7 and coloured teal on official transit maps.

== Line information ==

=== Stations ===
There are six stations served by KLIA Transit. They are, from north to south:

At KL Sentral, the two platforms of the ERL are accessed from different parts of the station. The KLIA Ekspres side platforms are accessed from the KL City Air Terminal (KL CAT) while the KLIA Transit island platform is accessed from the main Transit Concourse at Level 1. At KLIA Terminal 1 and 2, both KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit use the same island platform, with each service serving only one side of the platform.

At KLIA Terminal 1 station, KLIA Transit uses the same platform for Terminal 2- or city-bound trains. Displays are installed at the platform to indicate the travelling direction of the approaching train.

== History ==
KLIA Transit began operations on 20 June 2002. Since then there has only been one major accident.

=== Accidents ===
On 24 August 2010, Express Rail Link suffered their first reported accident in which 3 passengers were injured. Two ERL trains collided at Kuala Lumpur Sentral. One of the trains involved was about to depart at 9.45pm for Kuala Lumpur International Airport while the other train, which was empty, ran into it from behind.

=== Suspensions ===
On 4 April 2020, due to the Malaysian movement control order, which resulted in a significant reduction in ridership, all ERL rail services were temporarily suspended. Limited ERL services recommenced on 4 May 2020.

On 4 June 2021, due to the total lockdown phase of the Malaysian movement control order, all ERL rail services were temporarily suspended again. ERL services resumed on 10 September 2021.

== Operations ==

Trains run between 05:00 and midnight at frequencies of 15 minutes (peak) or 30 minutes (off-peak and weekends). 

=== Ticketing and Fares ===

One-way fares with effect from January 2016:

One-way and return tickets may be purchased from the ticketing office, at the automated ticketing kioks, from KLIA Ekspres website or via the KLIA Ekspres mobile app. 

Passengers holding AMEX, JCB, Mastercard, Visa, UnionPay contactless cards and Touch &#x27;n Go cards may pay directly at the fare gates without the need to purchase a separate ticket. Touch &#x27;n Go cards require a minimum balance of RM20. 

Weekly or monthly travel passes (TravelCard) linked to MyKad can be purchased at the ticketing office or via KLIA Ekspres website. TravelCards allow unlimited travels between two stations for seven or thirty days.

There is no free travel between KLIA Terminals 1 and 2. Passengers transferring between the terminals via KLIA Transit require a valid ticket.

=== Connection to Subang Airport ===
The KLIA Transit (and KLIA Ekspres) interchanges with KTM&#x27;s Skypark Link at KL Sentral, an airport-rail link serving the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (Subang Airport). This allows for a rail connection between KLIA Terminal 1, Terminal 2 and Subang Airport.

As of August 2024, SkyPark Link services are suspended.

<doc id="649883" wikidata="Q204323" url="?curid=649883" title="Phil Ramone">
<text>Philip Rabinowitz (January 5, 1934March 30, 2013), better known as Phil Ramone, was a South African-born American recording engineer, record producer, violinist and composer, and co-founder of A &amp; R recording studio. Its success led to expansion into several studios and a record production company. He was described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as &quot;legendary&quot;, and the BBC as a &quot;CD pioneer&quot;.

==Early life==
Ramone was born in South Africa and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. As a child in South Africa, Ramone was a musical prodigy, beginning to play the violin at age three and performing for Princess Elizabeth at age 10. In the late 1940s, he trained as a classical violinist at the Juilliard School, where one of his classmates was Phil Woods. Ramone opened his own recording studio before he was 20. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on December 14, 1953.

==Professional career==

===A &amp; R Recording===

In 1959, Ramone co-founded an independent New York City recording studio, A &amp; R Recording, with business partner Jack Arnold. In the studio he quickly gained a reputation as a good sound engineer and music producer, in particular for his use of innovative technology. Among the performers whose music Ramone produced are Burt Bacharach, the Band, Bono, Laura Branigan, Ray Charles, Karen Carpenter, Chicago, Peter Cincotti, Natalie Cole, Celine Dion, Bob Dylan, Sheena Easton, Melissa Errico, Gloria Estefan, Aretha Franklin, the Guess Who, Heatwave, Billie Hughes, Billy Joel, Debbie Gibson, Elton John, Quincy Jones, Patricia Kaas, B.B. King, Lazarus, Julian Lennon, Shelby Lynne, Madonna, Barry Manilow, Richard Marx, Paul McCartney, George Michael, Cyndi Lauper, Liza Minnelli, Anne Murray, Olivia Newton-John, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Fito Páez, Luciano Pavarotti (including the Pavarotti and Friends Charity Concerts in Modena, Italy), Peter, Paul and Mary, June Pointer, André Previn, Jennifer Rush, Diane Schuur, Jon Secada, Michael Sembello, Carly Simon, Paul Simon, Frank Sinatra, Phoebe Snow, Dusty Springfield, Rod Stewart, Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, Frankie Valli, Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, and Nikki Yanofsky. He also is credited with having recorded Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s version of &quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. President&quot; to John F. Kennedy.

In 1972, management of A &amp; R included Robert Gerics (general manager and studio manager), Nick Diminno (studio manager), and Irving Joel (chief engineer). The studios were located at 799 7th Avenue and 322 West 48th Street.

Ramone&#x27;s early work in producing and engineering was with jazz artists, working on John Coltrane records and acting as engineer for the &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; album in 1963, for which he won his first Grammy. He transitioned during the 1960s to working with folk-rock, pop-rock, and R&amp;B acts such as Peter, Paul and Mary, James Taylor, Aretha Franklin, and Bob Dylan, first primarily as an engineer, and later as a producer. He won his first production Grammy for his work on 1975&#x27;s &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; by Paul Simon. He produced Billy Joel&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;The Stranger&quot; and began a fruitful collaboration with Joel producing a string of hit albums throughout the rest of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1993, he produced &quot;Duets&quot;, Frank Sinatra&#x27;s comeback album, a commercial hit that peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Album Chart. During the rest of the 1990s, Ramone moved from production work to his primary role as an industry executive, serving as chairman of The Recording Academy, though he would still be involved in some studio work including several Broadway cast recordings, as well as helping produce, with Quincy Jones, the televised &quot;A Tribute to Brian Wilson&quot; in 2001.

===Technical innovations===
Ramone was a founding member of META (the Music &amp; Engineering Technology Alliance).

October 1, 1982, marked the anniversary of the world&#x27;s first commercially marketed compact disc. On that date in 1982, CBS/Sony released a digital compact disc of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;52nd Street&quot; in Japan, alongside Sony&#x27;s CD player CDP-101.

Ramone introduced optical surround sound for movies. His book, &quot;Making Records: The Scenes Behind the Music&quot;, written with Chuck Granata, was released on October 9, 2007. Also in October 2007, Ramone produced a limited engagement performance of Richard Vetere&#x27;s &quot;Be My Love: The Mario Lanza Story&quot;. The play was directed by Charles Messina and co-produced by Sonny Grosso. It premiered at The Tilles Center in Greenvale, New York.

===Other professional activities===
In addition to producing music, Ramone had numerous concert, film, Broadway, and television productions to his credit that include &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, &quot;Walkabout&quot;, &quot;August Rush&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, &quot;Flashdance&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Seussical&quot;, &quot;Simon and Garfunkel: The Concert In Central Park&quot;, &quot;Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards&quot;, &quot;The Score&quot;, VH1/BBC &quot;Party at the Palace: Queen’s Jubilee Concert&quot; and &quot;The Good Thief&quot;. A champion of music educational programs, Ramone served on the boards of the National Mentoring Partnership and Berklee College of Music.

===Later work===
On July 8, 2008, Columbia Records released &quot;The Stranger 30th Anniversary&quot;, which features interviews with Ramone. This box set includes a remastered version of the 1977 Billy Joel album &quot;The Stranger&quot; by Ramone. The following summer, Ramone produced &quot;Gershwin Across America&quot;, a tribute album to the music of George and Ira Gershwin. The album features Jewel, Jason Mraz, Darius Rucker, and Paul Simon. In 2011, Ramone worked with George Michael, during his 2011 Symphonica Tour. Also in 2011, Ramone produced the songs &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Back&quot; on Lalah Hathaway&#x27;s album &quot;Where It All Begins&quot;. One of Ramone&#x27;s final projects was as the producer of the rock band Chicago&#x27;s 2011 holiday album, Chicago XXXIII: O Christmas Three.

==Personal life==
Ramone was married to Karen Ichiuji-Ramone, with whom he had one son. Ramone had two sons from a prior marriage.

===Death===
Ramone was hospitalized in late February 2013 with an aortic aneurysm, and died on March 30, 2013, from complications involving the surgery related to it, at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was aged 79.

<text>Mark Thomas Lawrenson (born 2 June 1957) is a former professional footballer who played as a defender for Liverpool, among others, during the 1970s and 1980s. After a short career as a manager, he then became a radio, television and internet pundit for the BBC, TV3, BT Sport and Today FM, retiring at the end of the 2021–22 football season. Born and raised in England, Lawrenson qualified to play for the Republic of Ireland through his grandfather, Thomas Crotty, who was born in Waterford.

==Club career==

===Preston and Brighton===
Mark Lawrenson was born in Preston and attended St Teresa&#x27;s Catholic Primary School in Penwortham and, later, Preston Catholic College, a Jesuit school. His father, Tom, had been a winger for Preston North End. He always wanted to be a footballer, although his mother, Theresa, wanted him to become a priest. He began his career, as a 17-year-old, with his hometown club, Preston North End in 1974 who were then managed by World Cup winner Bobby Charlton. Lawrenson was voted Preston&#x27;s Player of the Year for the 1976–77 season.

After 73 league appearances for the Deepdale club he moved to Alan Mullery&#x27;s Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the summer before the start of the 1977–78 season for £100,000. Ironically, the then Second Division side outbid First Division Liverpool who also showed interest in the 19-year-old Lawrenson. Lawrenson made his Brighton debut on 20 August 1977 in a 1–1 draw against Southampton at The Dell. He settled in at the Goldstone Ground and made 40 league appearances by the end of his first season of the club. He went on to make 152 league appearances by the end of the 1980–81 season. However the club entered a financial crisis in 1981 and Lawrenson was forced to leave the club to make funds available. A number of clubs were interested in signing Lawrenson after his resilient performances for both Preston and Brighton, but it was Liverpool manager Bob Paisley who secured his signature.

===Liverpool===
Liverpool offered a club transfer record of £900,000, and Lawrenson joined in the summer of 1981. He was to form a formidable central defensive partnership with Alan Hansen after Phil Thompson suffered an injury. He was also used occasionally at left-back. He made his first start for the team at left-back in a 1–0 league defeat at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 29 August 1981. He scored his first goal a month later during the 7–0 European Cup 1st round 2nd leg trouncing of Finnish team Oulun Palloseura at Anfield on 30 September. Lawrenson came on for Ray Kennedy in the 64th minute scoring in the 72nd. Also coming off the bench to score his first goal for the club was Ian Rush.

In Lawrenson&#x27;s first full season, 1981–82, Liverpool won the League championship and the League Cup, defeating Tottenham Hotspur in the final. The team retained both titles for the next two seasons (in the League Cup finals defeating Manchester United in 1983 and Everton in 1984), becoming the third club in history to win three league titles in a row. They also added the club&#x27;s fourth European Cup in 1984, the last time Liverpool would win Europe&#x27;s most prestigious club prize until 2005. Lawrenson dislocated his shoulder three weeks before the 1985 European Cup final, the Heysel Stadium Disaster. He started the game, which Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus, but was injured after a few minutes and had to be substituted.

Lawrenson earned a reputation as an accomplished player and in the 1985–1986 season he was an integral part of the Liverpool side who completed the third league championship and FA Cup double of the 20th century. They overtook derby rivals Everton to win the league by two points and later came from behind to defeat Everton 3–1 in the 1986 FA Cup final at Wembley. After 1986, Lawrenson&#x27;s first team place came under threat from the younger Gary Gillespie. Lawrenson&#x27;s partnership with team captain Hansen continued for one more season before he, already out through a minor injury, suffered Achilles tendon damage in 1988 which prematurely ended his career. He earned a fifth and final title medal when that season ended. His Liverpool career ended after 332 appearances and 18 goals in all competitions – one of which was the fifth goal in a 5–0 defeat of Merseyside rivals Everton on 6 November 1982, a game in which Ian Rush scored four of the five goals.

In 1989, Lawrenson spent one season with the Florida side Tampa Bay Rowdies in the American Soccer League.

===Later career===
After his time at Liverpool, he was appointed Oxford United manager in 1988. His time at the club was frustrating and he resigned after star striker Dean Saunders was sold by the board of directors without Lawrenson&#x27;s approval. Over that winter, he made a brief playing comeback in the Football Conference, making two appearances for Barnet. Lawrenson also managed Peterborough United from 6 September 1989 until 9 November 1990.

Lawrenson returned to playing with non-league clubs Corby Town and Chesham United. His final season as a player was as part of the Chesham team that won the 1992-93 Isthmian League. The club was not promoted to the then Football Conference as this would have required ground improvements that could not be afforded, so he decided the time was right to retire from playing completely.

==International career==
After Preston coach (and former Irish international goalkeeper) Alan Kelly became aware of the young player&#x27;s Irish connections (and informed Irish international manager Johnny Giles), Lawrenson&#x27;s solid performances earned him a call-up to the Republic of Ireland national team. He won the first of 39 international caps at the age of 19, in a friendly with Poland on 24 April 1977 at Dalymount Park; the game ended 0–0. Ireland employed Lawrenson&#x27;s versatility and burgeoning talent by playing him at fullback, in midfield, and occasionally in his favoured position at centre half.

Lawrenson played his first competitive match on 12 October 1977 against Bulgaria in a 1978 World Cup qualifier. This match also ended 0–0, at Lansdowne Road (now Aviva Stadium). Lawrenson scored his first of his five goals for Ireland against Cyprus in Nicosia on 26 March 1980 in a 1982 World Cup Qualifier. He scored his second goal for Ireland in the next competitive match as Ireland beat Netherlands 2–1 at Lansdowne Road in the same qualification campaign. This was also notable as it was Eoin Hand&#x27;s first match as manager of Ireland. In between these two matches Mark Lawrenson renewed his Preston acquaintance with Alan Kelly Snr as Kelly managed Ireland in a caretaker capacity for a friendly against Switzerland.

Lawrenson scored two goals in Ireland&#x27;s record victory – an 8–0 thrashing of Malta in a 1984 European Championship qualifier but the Irish goal that he is best remembered for is one against Scotland. It was Jack Charlton&#x27;s first qualification campaign as Irish manager and Ireland were playing Scotland in Hampden Park in a 1988 Euro qualifier. A sixth-minute goal earned Ireland a precious away victory that went a very long way to helping Ireland to qualify for its first ever major football championship finals. Unfortunately for Lawrenson injury prevented him from making the Irish Euro 1988 squad for the finals.

Lawrenson played his last match for the Republic of Ireland against Israel on 10 November 1987. It was a friendly match at Dalymount Park and was also notable because David Kelly scored a hat trick on his international debut.

==Media career==
After retiring from international football Lawrenson wrote for the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, initially providing analysis for the 1990 World Cup. Lawrenson began his television career providing match analysis on HTV West&#x27;s local football coverage, before working as a pundit for the BBC but then left briefly to become a coach specialising in defensive tactics for Kevin Keegan at Newcastle United where he admitted in 2017 &quot;I did nothing. Absolutely nothing&quot; However, the position was again short-lived and he returned to media work. He has since become established as a pundit, both on BBC television and radio, often finding himself sitting alongside his former defensive partner, Alan Hansen. Since the departure from the BBC of Trevor Brooking, he has been the main co-commentator on major national and international (FIFA) matches covered by the television network. He appears regularly on &quot;Football Focus&quot; and &quot;Match of the Day&quot;.

He is also often a co-commentator on BBC Radio Five Live, often working on the feature matches on Sunday afternoons. He previously worked as a pundit for Ireland&#x27;s TV3 between 2001 and 2007 for mid-week Champions League games alongside Welsh national (FA) team manager and former Liverpool striker, John Toshack. When the Champions League returned to TV3 in 2010 he no longer provided punditry. He was replaced in that role by Tony Cascarino and Martin Keown, and moved into the commentary box alongside TV3 commentator Trevor Welch. He works for Irish radio station Today FM on &quot;Premiership Live&quot; with presenter Michael McMullan in talking about football related topics, predicting scores and stating facts. He also had a column on the BBC website where he gives his views and predictions on the Premier League&#x27;s weekend fixtures. Lawrenson is one of a number of ex-Liverpool players who made up the BBC pundit team.

He also writes a regular Preston North End column for the University of Central Lancashire&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union newspaper, &quot;Pluto&quot;, and a weekly column for the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot;. He worked with Japanese entertainment company Konami, recording commentary samples for the Pro Evolution Soccer series, alongside ITV commentator Jon Champion, from Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 to Pro Evolution Soccer 2010. He was replaced by ITV pundit Jim Beglin for Pro Evolution Soccer 2011. In addition, Lawrenson has also featured alongside John Motson as a commentator in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; series from &quot;99&quot; through &quot;2001&quot; and on the Euro 2000 video game.

In 2002, Lawrenson made a bet on &quot;Football Focus&quot; that Bolton Wanderers would be relegated from the Premiership in the 2001–02 season. He lost the bet after Sam Allardyce&#x27;s team stayed up, and shaved off his moustache as a result.

At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the BBC received 172 complaints after Lawrenson said that Swiss striker Josip Drmić &quot;should put a skirt on&quot;. The channel responded by stating &quot;We acknowledge that the remark by commentator Mark Lawrenson about Switzerland&#x27;s Josip Drmić was inappropriate and we apologise for any offence caused by it&quot;.

At the end of the 2021–22 Premier League season, and after a 30-year stint with the BBC, during which he covered a total of six World Cups, Lawrenson was told by the football head his typical one-year contract would not be renewed. He subsequently claimed that the cause was ostensibly BBC&#x27;s &quot;woke culture&quot;. He stated that a &quot;very early woke moment&quot; occurred 25 years previously, in the aftermath of Princess Diana&#x27;s death, when an editor allegedly told him to &quot;not mention the wall&quot; if describing free kicks in a forthcoming match.

==Personal life==
In 2003, Lawrenson was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from Myerscough College near Preston for his achievements in football.

In 2018, he was given the all-clear after having a cancerous growth removed from his face. He was made aware of the seriousness of the growth when a concerned viewer contacted the editor of &quot;Football Focus&quot;. Lawrenson later met the viewer, Dr Alan Brennan, on television.

<text>Dogtown and Z-Boys is a 2001 American documentary film co-written and directed by Stacy Peralta, produced by Agi Orsi, and narrated by Sean Penn. The documentary explores the pioneering of the Zephyr skateboard team in the 1970s (of which Peralta was a member) and the evolving sport of skateboarding. Using a mix of film of the Zephyr skateboard team (Z-Boys) shot in the 1970s by Craig Stecyk, along with contemporary interviews, the documentary tells the story of a group of teenage surfer/skateboarders and their influence on the history of skateboarding (and to a lesser extent surfing) culture.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot;, narrated by Sean Penn, begins with the history of skateboarding in Southern California and how it had been strongly influenced by the surf culture in the surrounding areas of Santa Monica and Venice, nicknamed &quot;Dogtown&quot;. Surf shop owners Jeff Ho, Skip Engblom, and Craig Stecyk established the Zephyr Skateboard Team with local teenagers from broken homes. The sport of skateboarding evolved as the Z-Boys continued to bring edgy moves influenced by surfing. During one of California&#x27;s record-breaking droughts, local backyard pools were emptied and became hotspots for these young skateboarders looking for places to skateboard. The members of the Zephyr team gained notoriety and national attention when they competed in skateboard championships and started to receive media attention for their skills as young athletes. Testimonials and commentary provided by the members and founders of the Zephyr team combined with the rock-and-roll soundtrack and vintage footage all come together in this documentary about the history and lives of the original Z-Boys and skateboarding subculture of California.

==Cast==
The documentary includes footage, commentary, and interviews from eleven of the original members of the Z-Boys team, along with the team&#x27;s co-founders, skateboarding champions, and other relevant skateboarding figures, journalists, and musicians from the era.

==Production==
The documentary features vintage video footage and photos of the Zephyr skateboard team from the 1970s, along with contemporary interviews from the original members of the Z-Boys group. The film combines the 8-mm and 16-mm vintage footage with modern editing and a soundtrack crafted from music of the 1970s era.

&quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; was directed by Stacy Peralta, an original member of the Zephyr team, and written by Peralta and Craig Stecyk, a leading surf and skateboard film producer and photojournalist.

The film operated on a budget of $400,000 financed by Vans, Inc. Stecyk and photojournalist Glen E. Friedman, were the film&#x27;s co-writer and co-producer, respectively, Daniel Ostroff and Stephen Nemeth were also co-producers, and Debra MacCulloch and Christine Triano were associate producers involved with the film.

==Reception==
&quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; debuted at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival where it won two awards: the Audience Award and Directing Award. The film also won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary in 2001.

The film was well received by many critics, including reporter Steve McKee of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; who stated that the documentary had opened with &quot;boffo reviews&quot; from around the country. The film received a rating of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and a generally favorable rating of 76 on Metacritic. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film was a &quot;giddy, thrilling, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll-saturated history of skateboarding in Southern California.&quot;

On the opening weekend of April 2002, &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; made $103,355. By August 2002, the film had grossed $1,293,295 in the United States. According to Peralta in a 2004 interview, &quot;&quot;Dogtown&quot; has sold over a million DVDs and more than 700,000 VHS.&quot;

<text>A county council is the elected administrative body governing an area known as a county. This term has slightly different meanings in different countries.

==Australia==
In the Australian state of New South Wales, county councils are special purpose local governments, to which a group of local government areas delegate the provision of certain services. Note that although New South Wales has counties, the county councils are not governments of the counties (which have never had governments), but rather of distinct county districts.

==Norway==
In Norway, a county council () is the highest governing body of a county municipality (&quot;fylkeskommune&quot;). The county council sets the scope of the county municipal activity. The council is led by the Chairman of the County Council, more commonly called a County Mayor (&quot;fylkesordfører&quot;). Members of the council are elected for a four-year term through the general local elections, which can extended for a second four-year term. It is common for members of a county council to also hold seats in municipal councils, but very rare that they also hold legislative (Storting) or other government office, without a leave of absence.

The (elected) county mayor should not be confused with the (appointed) county governor.

The county council has its roots in &quot;Amtsformandskabet&quot; created in 1837. Starting in 1964, members of the county councils were appointed by the municipal councils. In 1975, the first general elections were held for the county councils.

==Ireland==
The county councils created under British rule in 1899 continue to exist in Ireland, although they are now governed under legislation passed by the Oireachtas, with the principal act being the Local Government Act 2001.

===History===
====1899–1922====
The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 introduced county councils to Ireland, with a lower tier of governance of urban and rural districts. The administrative and financial business carried by county grand juries and county at large presentment sessions were transferred to the new councils. Principal among these duties were the maintenance of highways and bridges, the upkeep and inspection of lunatic asylums and the appointment of coroners. The new bodies also took over some duties from poor law boards of guardians in relation to diseases of cattle and from the justices of the peace to regulate explosives.

The Irish county councils differed in constitution from those in Great Britain. Most of the council was directly elected: each county was divided by the Local Government Board for Ireland into district electoral divisions, each returning a single councillor for a three-year term. In addition urban districts were to form electoral divisions: depending on population they could return multiple county councillors. The county councils were also to consist of &quot;additional members&quot;:
*The chairman of each rural district council in the county was to be an member. Where the chairman had already been elected to the council or was disqualified, the RDC was to appoint another member of their council to be an additional member.
*The council could also co-opt one or two additional members for a three-year term.

The first county council elections were held on 6 April 1899, and the first business of their inaugural meetings being the appointment of additional members. The triennial elections were postponed in 1914 on the outbreak of World War I.

The introduced proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote to county councils, elected from multi-member electoral areas. Only one election was under the new system before independence, held in January 1920 (in urban areas) and on 2 June 1920 (in rural areas), during the Irish War of Independence.

====1922 to present====
The Irish Free State inherited the local authorities created by the United Kingdom legislation. The first elections after independence were held on 23 June 1925, following amendments by the Local Government Act 1925. The act abolished rural district councils (except in County Dublin) and passed their powers to the county councils. At the following election all county councils were to be increased: the number of extra councillors was to be twice the number of abolished rural districts. The act set out the powers and duties of county councils and also gave the Minister for Local Government the power to dissolve councils if he was satisfied that &quot;the duties of a local council are not being duly and effectually discharged&quot;. He could order new elections to be held, or transfer the power and properties of the council &quot;to any body or persons or person he shall think fit&quot;. The power was widely used by ministers of all parties. For example, Kerry County Council was dissolved from 1930 to 1932, and from 1945 to 1948, with commissioners appointed to perform the council&#x27;s function.

The number of county councils was increased from 27 to 29 in 1994 when County Dublin was split under the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993 into three new counties: Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin.

In 2014, under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the number of county councils was again reduced: a merger of North Tipperary and South Tipperary County Councils created a single Tipperary County Council; and the city and county councils of Limerick and Waterford were merged to create Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council.

==Taiwan==

In Taiwan, a county council is the legislative body of each county. Members of the councils are elected through local elections held every 4 years.

===1950 to 1999===
The &quot;Outline for Implementing Local Autonomy for Cities and Counties&quot; was promulgated in April 1950. County councils were established in 1951.

===1999 to present===
In 1999 the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; was enacted. As stipulated in the Act, duties of the county councils include approving the county budget, levying local taxes and enacting local ordinances.

==United Kingdom==

County councils were formed in the late 19th century. In the various constituent countries of the United Kingdom councils had different powers and different memberships. Following local government reforms in the 1970s, county councils no longer exist in Scotland or Northern Ireland. In England they generally form the top level in a two-tier system of administration; in Wales they are unitary authorities.

===England===

In England county councils were introduced in 1889, and reformed in 1974. Since the mid-1990s a series of local government reorganisations has reduced the number of county councils as unitary authorities have been established in a number of areas. County councils are very large employers with a great variety of functions including education (schools and youth services), social services, highways, fire and rescue services, libraries, waste disposal, consumer services and town and country planning. Until the 1990s they also ran colleges of further education and the careers services. That decade also saw the privatisation of some traditional services, such as highway maintenance, cleaning and school meals.

====History====
County councils were created by the Local Government Act 1888 (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. 41), largely taking over the administrative functions of the unelected county courts of quarter sessions. County councils consisted of councillors, directly elected by the electorate; and county aldermen, chosen by the council itself. There was one county alderman for every three councillors (one for every six in the London County Council). The first elections to the councils were held at various dates in January 1889, and they served as &quot;provisional&quot; or shadow councils until 1 April, when they came into their powers. Elections of all councillors and half of the aldermen took place every three years thereafter. The areas over which the councils had authority were designated as administrative counties. The writ of the county councils did not extend everywhere: large towns and some historic counties corporate were constituted county boroughs by the same act. County borough councils were independent of the council for the county in which they were geographically situated, and exercised the functions of both county and district councils. The new system was a major modernisation, which reflected the increasing range of functions carried out by local government in late Victorian Britain. A major accretion of powers took place when education was added to county council responsibilities in 1902. County councils were responsible for more strategic services in a region, with (from 1894) smaller urban district councils and rural district councils responsible for other activities. The Local Government Act 1929 considerably increased the powers of county councils. Primarily, the Boards of Guardians were abolished: workhouses were taken over by the county councils as public assistance institutions, and county councils also assumed responsibility for former poor law infirmaries, and fever hospitals. County councils also took charge of highways in rural districts.

In 1965 there was a reduction in the number of county councils. The London Government Act 1963 abolished those of London and Middlesex and created the Greater London Council. Greater London was declared to be an &quot;area&quot; and not to lie in any county. In addition two pairs of administrative counties were merged to become Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely and Huntingdon and Peterborough under recommendations made by the Local Government Commission for England. The Local Government Act 1972 completely reorganised local authorities in England and Wales. County boroughs were abolished and the whole of England (apart from Greater London) was placed in a two-tier arrangement with county councils and district councils. In the six largest conurbations metropolitan county councils, with increased powers, were created. The post of county alderman was abolished, and the entire council was thereafter directly elected every four years. In 1986 the six metropolitan county councils were abolished, with their functions transferred to the metropolitan boroughs and joint boards. The Local Government Act 1992 established a new Local Government Commission whose remit was to conduct a review of the structure of local administration, and the introduction of unitary authorities where appropriate. Accordingly, the number of county councils was reduced: Avon, Berkshire, Cleveland, Hereford and Worcester and Humberside were abolished, while Worcestershire County Council was re-established. The reforms somewhat blurred the distinction between county and district council. The Isle of Wight county council became a unitary authority, renamed the &quot;Isle of Wight Council&quot;. Conversely, two unitary district councils added the word &quot;county&quot; to their titles to become &quot;Rutland County Council District Council&quot; and &quot;County of Herefordshire District Council&quot;.

====21st-century reforms====
A further wave of local government reform took place in April 2009 under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. Following invitations from central government in 2007, a number of county councils and their associated districts examined ways in which local government provision could be rationalised, mainly in the form of abolishing the existing county and district councils and establishing one-tier authorities for all or parts of these existing counties. As a result, the status of some of these (mainly) more rural counties changed. Cornwall, Durham, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire became unitary authorities providing all services. Some of these councils have dropped the word &quot;county&quot; from their titles. Bedfordshire and Cheshire county councils were abolished with more than one unitary council established within the boundaries of the abolished council. Other county councils remained unchanged, particularly in the heavily populated parts of England such as the south-east. Further minor local government reforms took place in 2019–20, which led to Dorset and Buckinghamshire also becoming unitary authorities providing all services.

===Northern Ireland===

County councils existed in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 1973.

Following partition, six administrative counties remained within the United Kingdom as part of Northern Ireland. Local government came under the control of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, who quickly introduced the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1922, abolishing proportional representation. Electoral districts were redrawn, and a property qualification for voters (Plural voting) introduced, ensuring Unionist controlled councils in counties with Nationalist majorities. In 1968 Fermanagh County Council was reconstituted as a unitary authority. County councils were abolished under the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 in 1973. The only local authorities since that date have been district councils.

===Scotland===
In Scotland county councils existed from 1890 to 1975. They were created by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 and reconstituted forty years later by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. County councils were abolished in 1975 when a system of large regional councils was introduced. Regions were themselves abolished in 1996 and replaced by the current unitary council areas.

====History====
In Scotland, control of county administration was in the hands of Commissioners of Supply. This was a body of the principal landowners liable to pay land tax, and was unelected. The first elections to Scottish county councils took place in February 1890. Only the councillors for the &quot;landward&quot; part of the county were elected however. The remainder of the council were co-opted by the town councils of the burghs in the county. Scottish county councils also differed from those in England and Wales as they were required to divide their county into districts. A district committee of the county councillors elected for the area were an independent local council for some administrative purposes.

In 1930 the Scottish county councils were completely reconstituted. Their powers were increased in small burghs. On the other hand, large burghs became independent of the county for most purposes. The district committees created in 1890 were abolished and replaced by district councils, partly consisting of county councillors and partly of directly elected district councillors. Two joint county councils were created, for Perthshire and Kinross-shire and Moray and Nairnshire. The county councils also gained the duties of the abolished education authorities.

===Wales===
Since 1996 Wales has been divided into unitary principal areas. Principal councils were designated by the legislation that created them as either &quot;county councils&quot; or &quot;county borough councils&quot;. County and county borough councils have identical powers.

===History===

Prior to 1996 local government in Wales was similar to that in England. Thus the county councils introduced in 1889 were identical to their English counterparts. The Local Government Commission for Wales appointed under the Local Government Act 1958 recommended a reduction in the number of county councils in Wales and Monmouthshire from thirteen to seven, but reform did not take place until 1974.

From 1 April 1974 the number of counties and county councils was reduced to eight in number. Like the county councils introduced in England at the same time, the whole council was elected every four years. There was a slightly different division of powers between county and district councils, however. The county and district councils were abolished twenty-two years later, when the present system of principal areas was introduced.

==United States==

A county council is a type of local government that is responsible for providing services to a specific county or region. It is typically composed of elected officials who are responsible for making decisions about the county&#x27;s budget, infrastructure, and services. County councils are responsible for providing services such as education, health care, public safety, transportation, and social services. They also have the power to levy taxes and fees to fund these services. County councils are typically responsible for maintaining roads, bridges, and other infrastructure within their county. They also have the power to pass laws and regulations that affect the county. County councils are typically responsible for providing services to their constituents, such as libraries, parks, and other recreational facilities. County councils are also responsible for providing services to the elderly, disabled, and other vulnerable populations. County councils are typically responsible for providing services to the environment, such as water and air quality, and for protecting natural resources. County councils are also responsible for providing services to businesses, such as economic development and job training.

==Other countries==

The term county council is sometimes used in English for regional municipal bodies in other countries.
* County Councils of Sweden (&quot;landsting&quot;)
* County councils of Romania (&quot;consilii județene&quot;)

Both Swedish and Norwegian county councils are directly elected by their inhabitants as it is also the case in Romania during local elections. There are some differences between them in responsibilities.

<text>Purfleet railway station is on the London, Tilbury and Southend line serving the town of Purfleet, Essex. It is down the line from London Fenchurch Street and it is situated between to the west and to the east. Its three-letter station code is PFL.

It was opened in 1854 by the London Tilbury and Southend Railway and initially trains ran from Tilbury to Stratford where the train split for either Spitalfields or Fenchurch Street. The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c. Although outside London fare zone 6, the station became part of the Oyster card pay-as-you-go network in 2010.

==History==
===Early years (1854-1922)===
West of Purfleet the railway had crossed marshland before turning south towards Purfleet. This route made use of a number of worked out chalk pits some of which had early tramways down to wharves on the River Thames. The station consisting of two platforms was opened by the London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) on 13 April 1854 and trains served Tilbury and, by 1856, were working through to Southend. A single siding goods yard was provided on the up side west of the station.

Adjacent to the station on the down side were the Botany Pleasure Gardens which occupied some of the old chalk pits. These chalk pits which had quarried chalk for agricultural purposes had employed around 400 people in 1848 but had largely closed by the 1850s and were overgrown. These were accessed by a footbridge that passed over the station and the gardens were a source of excursion traffic through to the 1900s when they closed for good.

After that the chalk extraction recommenced with the tramway passing in a new tunnel under the station to a wharf on the Thames. Between 1900 and 1903 various improvements to the station were made including longer platforms, a footbridge and a second siding in the goods yard.

The Midland Railway took over the LT&amp;SR on 7 August 1912 and Purfleet became a Midland Railway station.

In 1914 a large army camp was established north of the station and as a result Purfleet got extended booking and luggage storage facilities on the up side.

===London Midland and Scottish Railway (1923-1948)===
Following the Railways Act 1921 the station became the responsibility of the London Midland and Scottish (LMS) railway from 1 January 1923.

Around 1930 the Botany chalk pit fell out of use and later in that decade the Botany footbridge (by then long disused) was removed.

During the 1930s the LMS were considering four tracking east of Purfleet and land was set aside on the down (north) side of the line to accommodate this.

After World War II started there were significant cuts to passenger services on the line in the timetable of 25 September 1939.

A German V2 rocket fell on the railway east of the station on 24 July 1944 resulting in the railway being closed until the following day while repairs were made.

===British Railways (1948-1994)===
Following nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways in 1948, the station transferred under British Railways to the London Midland Region. On 20 February 1949, the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LT&amp;SR still was a distinctive system operated by former LT&amp;SR and LMS locomotives until electrification.
The line between Purfleet and West Thurrock Junction was flooded during the North Sea flood of 1953 on the night of 1 February 1953. The line suffered considerable damage and was re-opened to traffic on 19 February 1953. Many of the private sidings (see below) and their associated works were also flooded notably the Jurgens factory and the Thames Board Works.

Early in 1961 a modern station building was built with access off London Road rather than the station approach. A new footbridge was also built at this time. 

A full electric timetable started operating in June 1962 and this was primarily worked by Class 302 EMUs.

The goods yard was closed to goods traffic on 2 November 1964 although the track remained for the two private sidings that were still operating there.

The LTS line and Purfleet station became part of the London and South Eastern sector of British Rail in 1982, and in June 1986 this was rebranded as Network South East (NSE). With the Conservative government of the early 1990s looking to privatise the railways, the operation of the NSE passenger train service was put under the control of a Train Operating Unit.

===The privatisation era (1994-present day)===
On privatisation in 1996, infrastructure ownership passed to Railtrack and Prism Rail took over operations of the franchise, marketing the route as LTS Rail. Prism Rail were bought out by National Express in 2000 and in 2002 the line was rebranded as c2c.

Ownership of the infrastructure passed to Network Rail in 2002. 

National Express sold the operation of the franchise to Trenitalia in 2017.

The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c and are operated by Class 357 and Class 720/6 EMUs.

A detailed history of the franchises can be found on the c2c page.

==Future plans==

As part of a development involving up to 3000 new homes, there are plans to re-site, rename and upgrade the railway station. The station will be located slightly further north. The ticket office is to be moved overhead rather than to the side of the station and lifts and a new footbridge are proposed as well as a new larger car park and future space for retail. The level crossing may also be closed as part of these plans and replaced with a road bridge. One other thing proposed is that the name of the station be renamed to Purfleet on Thames, after the town was renamed in 2020 to attract more visitors. A planning application was submitted in May 2023.

==Operations==
===Services===
====September 1882====
The first down weekday train that stopped at Purfleet departed Fenchurch Street at 9:03am arriving at 09:47. The next service was three hours later at 12:03pm and three hours later after that at 3:03pm. The next service was at 4:23pm although this service did not call on Saturday. There was then a gap to 6:15pm with evening trains at 7:45pm and finally 9:15 arriving at Purfleet just before 10pm. This is a total of seven weekday trains and surprisingly Sunday had six down services calling.

The first up all stations train ran at 7:50am which arrived in Fenchurch Street at 8:33, followed by a service two hours later at 9:49am. The next service ran in the afternoon at 12:20pm then there were three further trains before the last up departure at 9:46pm getting into Fenchurch Street at 10:38pm. On Sunday there were six up services at Purfleet.

The reason the service was so sparse was the LT&amp;SR only had 18 locomotives for passenger work and some of these had to work goods and other services as well. Commuting was the preserve of the well paid and on the LT&amp;SR they were based in Southend and Gravesend (which they accessed via Tilbury station and ferries. 

====June 2024====
As of the June 2024 timetable the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
* 2 tph (trains per hour) westbound to London Fenchurch Street 
* 2 tph eastbound to 

===Accidents===
East of the station there were a number of Private Occupation Crossings connected to some of the industrial concerns along the route which were worked by company staff.

On 18 February 1924 a motorist was killed on the Thames Board Mill crossing due to (road) driver error.

In 1983 the gateman at the Thames Board Mill crossing (the same location as above) mistakenly raised the barriers protecting the line and a car was hit by a train killing the car driver.

===Signal Boxes===
The original station box was on the up platform and opened in 1888. This was replaced in 1924 by a Midland Railway style box and a number of other infrastructure changes were made at the same time.

The signal box closed in 1996 when control transferred to Upminster signalling centre.

===Private sidings===
Because the railway was close to the River Thames at this point a number of private sidings and terminals existed in the area. These were set up in three major phases with some changing use over the years.

Between 1889 and 1891 the St Louis Park Paper Mill Co opened a siding east of the station and accessed off two new sidings provided by the LT&amp;SR in 1891. In 1902 this became the Thames Board Mills and a major employer in Purfleet. Anglo American opened a wharf and sidings in the following year and in 1890 the Tank Storage opened a site called Caspian Wharf. This firm was taken over by Anglo-American in 1910.

In 1902 Purfleet Wharf and Saw Mills (after 1941 known as Purfleet Deep Wharf) occupied land east of Caspian Wharf and during World War I the site was taken over by the Royal Engineers. In 1906 the Steam Ship Coal Owners opened a site on the river south of the station and this site had its own internal rail system.

In 1912 British Petroleum opened a site east of Purfleet Wharf and during 1917/18 a factory was built by Jurgens (later Van der Berghs) and opened east of this for the manufacture of margarine.

The majority of traffic was outward in nature.

In the early 1920s the Thames Board Mills opened a new factory and sidings on the down side of the line which were bought into operation with the new Purfleet signal box and infrastructure changes. In 1930 the Ebano Oil Company opened a line west of the station that connected from the goods yard and joined the former chalk pit route to the wharf. Ebano Oil became part of Anglo-American in 1935. Anglo-American was taken over by Esso in 1951. As late as 1962 Powell Duffryn had a siding that ran from the goods yard built to supply a tank farm in a disused chalk pit.

After that private siding operations gradually contracted the exception being Purfleet Terminal detailed below and an aggregates siding for Foster Yeoman installed in 1984.

The December 2024 Network Rail Sectional Appendix Anglia Area shows the following rail connections in the Purfleet area. 
* Foster Yeoman
* Purfleet Deep Wharf (Purfleet freight terminal)
* West Thurrock Tarmac Terminal

There are two out of use sidings - Thames Matex and the Van Den Burghs, 

=== Purfleet Freight Terminal ===
Purfleet Freight Terminal is the closest Roll-on/Roll-off (RORO) ferry port to London. Operated by C.RO Ports, the combined freight terminal handles 250,000 lorry trailers and ISO containers and tanks per year, and via a dedicated Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) facility, the import/export of 400,000 vehicles. There are four railway sidings on site, accessed via the London, Tilbury and Southend line to allow direct unloading/loading from ferry or lorry to rail. Scheduled ferry services are operated daily by sister-company Cobelfret Ferries to the Port of Zeebrugge, Belgium and the Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands.

===West Thurrock Yard===
This now closed yard was located east of the Purfleet sidings and served the following sidings:
* A short lived Kirk and Randall Chalk Siding used in connection with the construction of the Port of Tilbury for which they were the contractors.
* The Tunnel Cement Company 1916 -1976 
* The Government sidings opened in 1917
* Thames Matex - 1965 - 1993
* Lafarge

The area was controlled by its own signal box.

<doc id="649897" wikidata="Q4844809" url="?curid=649897" title="Grays railway station">
<text>Grays railway station is on the London, Tilbury and Southend line serving the town of Grays, Essex. It is down the line from London Fenchurch Street via and is located at the junction where a branch line from via re-joins the route from Rainham. Its three-letter station code is GRY.

It was opened in 1854 by the London Tilbury and Southend Railway on the line from Fenchurch Street to Tilbury and Southend. In 1892 Grays became a station with the new line linking Grays and Ockendon with Upminster. Between 1870 and 1960 the land south of the railway was populated by heavy industry most of which had private sidings and internal rail systems with their own locomotives. 

The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c. Although outside the London fare zones, the station became part of the Oyster card pay-as-you-go network in 2010.

==History==
===Early years 1854-1922===
The station was opened as Grays Thurrock on 13 August 1854 on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway&#x27;s line to Tilbury which had opened a few months earlier.

Initially the station had two platforms with station buildings and a goods yard on the up side west of the station. Crossing the tracks was via a level-crossing at the east end of the station.

In the 1880s the town of Grays was increasing in population and the LT&amp;SR recognised the need for improved facilities. In 1882 a footbridge was provided at the east end of the station which could be used by pedestrians when the level crossing gates were closed. This was because the town had spread to both sides of the railway. 

The rebuilding of the station took place in 1885 and 1886 with new station building provided west of the original building which was subsequently demolished. The goods yard was extended westward and southward at this time and a replacement goods shed provided.

A new bay platform was provided at the west end of the station ahead of the service to Upminster commencing in 1892. The line from Upminster joined the main line at West Thurrock Junction which is just under a mile to the west of Grays station. Between West Thurrock Junction and Grays station there were a number of private sidings which are detailed below.

In the early 1900s the station became known as Grays. The original settlement of Grays had been south of the railway but had expanded and now included houses and shops north of the railway. By the end of the 19th Century road traffic increased over the High Street level crossing at the east end of he station instead giving rise to a number of complaints. However this remained a problem until 1975.

The Midland Railway took over the LTSR on 7 August 1912 and Grays became a Midland Railway station.

===London Midland and Scottish Railway (1923-1948)===
Following the Railways Act 1921 the station became the responsibility of the London Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railway from 1 January 1923. 

Some of the cement factories had closed early in the 1920s (see below) but the area remained a busy location for goods traffic.

After World War II started there were significant cuts to passenger services on the line in the timetable of 25 September 1939.

During World War II on Saturday 15 March 1941 the up side station buildings suffered a direct hit by a bomb and was damaged beyond repair.

===The Nationalisation era (1948-1994)===

Following nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways in 1948, the station transferred under British Railways to the London Midland Region. On 20 February 1949, the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification.
In 1954 a new upside station building was provided which had a pre-cantilevered roof made of pre-stressed concrete. The roof acted as a cover for the front of the station and a shelter on the platforms and is still in place in 2025.

Re-signalling of the area prior to electrification occurred and the Grays West signal box was closed at that this time. Simplification of some of the goods yard infrastructure was carried out at this time as well. Most notably a third reversible line was introduced between West Thurrock Junction and the station meaning no interaction with main line services was now required. This became operational on 28 August 1961.

The branch to Upminster remained steam operated until January 1958 when DMUs took over operation.

In November 1961 the Grays to Upminster branch was electrified.

A full electric timetable started operating in June 1962 and this was primarily worked by Class 302 EMUs. 

In 1968 the former Seabrook Brewery siding area (see below) was adapted as the new route to the Port of Tilbury who had opened a new Freightliner Terminal.

In the early 1970s the historic town centre was demolished under the Thurrock Urban District&#x27;s Council plan and the High Street level crossing was replaced by a foot crossing in 1975. A new overbridge had been provided for the road traffic.

The LTS line and Purfleet station became part of the London and South Eastern sector of British Rail in 1982, and in June 1986 this was rebranded as Network South East (NSE). With the Conservative government of the early 1990s looking to privatise the railways, the operation of the NSE passenger train service was put under the control of a Train Operating Unit.

===The privatisation era (1994-present day)===
On privatisation in 1996, infrastructure ownership passed to Railtrack and Prism Rail took over operations of the franchise, marketing the route as LTS Rail. Prism Rail were bought out by National Express in 2000 and in 2002 the line was rebranded as c2c.

Ownership of the infrastructure passed to Network Rail in 2002. 

National Express sold the operation of the franchise to Trenitalia in 2017.

The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c and are operated by Class 357 and Class 720/6 EMUs.

A detailed history of the franchises can be found on the c2c page.

In 2005 the station environment was refurbished, in particular the subway linking the platforms, and the surrounding highway infrastructure. In January 2006 the footbridge linking Grays High Street at either side of the railway was declared unsafe and closed due to structural problems with the supports and bracing, which had to be temporarily supported with scaffolding underneath the stair flights. A hoarding was subsequently erected on this scaffolding. The footbridge reopened in May 2006. Works to replace the stair flights have been completed. Although located at the end of the platforms, there is no station access at this point.

During 2008 and 2009 the four-carriage bay platform was extended to hold eight-coach trains. From 2011 to 2012 the through platforms were extended to receive 12-coach trains.

==Operations==
===Services===
As of the June 2024 timetable the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
* 2 tph (trains per hour) westbound to London Fenchurch Street via Ockendon
* 2 tph westbound to London Fenchurch Street via Rainham
* 2 tph eastbound to 

===Signal Boxes===
West to East the signal boxes after the branch to Upminster opened were:
* West Thurrock Junction (&quot;circa&quot; 1890)
* Grays West (opened 5 November 1901)
* Grays East (opened 5 November 1901 - these two boxes replaced the original 1881 box and were linked to changes at the station with regard to the new bay platform.)

Re-signalling in 1961 saw Grays West box closed and all activity concentrated on Grays East which was close to the High Street foot crossing east of the station. This box had control of the new route to the Port of Tilbury via the Seabrooks Brewery siding alignment started in 1968. 

In 1996 control transferred to the Upminster signalling centre which controls the former LT&amp;S system. A few minor changes to the remaining infrastructure were made as part of this change and Thurrock West Junction and the remaining Grays box closed on 3 April 1996.

===Private Sidings===
West Thurrock Junction to Grays was a very busy area for goods traffic with a number of private sidings serving riverside industries. These are listed west to east starting at West Thurrock Junction and ending at the present junction for the Port of Tilbury.

Two cement works existed alongside each other. The western one was Thames Works owned by the Thames Cement Company. This was taken over by APCM in 1900 but closed in 1920. Chalk came from a quarry north of the railway that went under the main lines but a main line connection was &quot;not&quot; provided. Thames Works had an internal railway system.

After closure in 1920 he site was purchased by the Thames Land Company and a large soap works called &quot;Hedleys&quot; was built. This was connected to West Thurrock Yard on 23 January 1938 on and three sidings provided. The old internal railway was re-used and that ceased operation in 1955. The site became known as Proctor and Gamble&#x27;s sidings in the 1960s and fell out of use in the 1990s.

Wouldham Works was a large cement works located between the main line and the River Thames. It opened in 1874 as the Lion Cement works and was bought by the Wouldham Cement Company who operated the site until 1911 when Blue Circle Cement took over. 

Chalk was supplied to the site via a railway line from a quarry north of the railway line and this line passed under the main line, and later the Upminster branch, immediately west of West Thurrock Junction. The works was connected to the main line on 29 December 1902 and there were a number of sidings for inward and outward traffic which was primarily coal (inwards) and cement products (outwards). The latter also left on barges from the wharf on the River Thames.

There was an internal rail system worked by a number of steam, and later diesel locomotives which moved materials around the works, from the quarries to/from the sidings and to the wharves. The railway from the quarry as replaced by a conveyor in the early sixties but the internal railway still continued operation on site.

The works closed in 1976 and the mainline connections were removed in the 1996 re-signalling.

Paktank Sidings were a relatively late addition and sited on the down side on the third line between West Thurrock Junction and Grays station. There were three sidings the site, later known as Unitank Storage, the site closed sometime in the 1990s.

A third cement works called Grays Portland Cement Works existed and was supplied by two quarry lines both of which passed under the main line. There was a rail connection at Grays station on the down side but most material arrived or left by barge by one of the company&#x27;s two jetties. The works had an internal rail system and closed c1922.

There were two sidings that ran off the station goods yard and at various times these served a timber yard (shown as railway sleeper wharf on maps), Grays Engineering Works and T W Ward shipbreakers (which also scrapped some steam locomotives in the 1960s). The latter was the last private siding in use at Grays with the site closing in 1983. 

East of the station Seabrooks Brewery had a siding which was located east of the station on what was then the edge of town. The brewery was established in 1799 and closed in 1929 when Charringtons bought out Seabrooks. The siding was opened in 1901 although the plan for the area had been to establish four tracks to Tilbury East Junction and the Port of Tilbury yard. 

After that, the brewery was bought by the Cooperative Society became a laundry and dairy. In the 1960s the site was being used as a rail served coal depot which closed in the mid 1960s but the sidings were reused as new rail access to Tilbury Docks in 1969.

The reason the additional two tracks were not built in 1901 was as a result of a standard gauge railway that went over the tracks to the east of Seabrooks. Formerly a quarry line to the river the line was then owned by Charles Wall who was a building contractor who may have possibly hired out industrial locomotives. A siding was built and opened in 1901 that connected to the Seabrooks area but neither the LT&amp;SR or Wall wanted to pay for a new wider bridge to accommodate the two new tracks. The rail bridge was converted to a road bridge in 1941 to provide better access to Tilbury Docks and the rail connection removed.

<text>Chafford Hundred railway station, also known as Chafford Hundred Lakeside station, is located on a single-track branch line of the London, Tilbury and Southend line, serving the area of Chafford Hundred as well as Lakeside Shopping Centre in Essex. It is down the line from London Fenchurch Street via ; it is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is CFH.

The station has a single platform and was opened on 30 May 1995 by Railtrack. Today, all passenger train services are operated by c2c, which also manages the station. Although outside the London fare zones 1 to 6, the station became part of the Oyster card pay-as-you-go network in 2010. It is the busiest single-platform station in the UK.

==History==

The single-track line through the area was opened in 1893 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) as part of a branch from to via . By the late 20th century service on the line had been reduced to a relatively infrequent shuttle between Upminster and Grays, calling at the only intermediate station at .

Following the opening of Lakeside Shopping Centre in 1990 a new single-platform station was opened on 30 May 1995 by Railtrack. The £1 million station was funded by the Chafford Hundred development consortium. Initially a free shuttle bus connected the station to the shopping centre, with a direct pedestrian bridge link replacing the bus in 2000. The shuttle train service was eventually extended beyond Upminster to in London and beyond Grays to in Southend-on-Sea, with service frequency increased to two trains an hour in each direction.

Usage is moderate for a suburban station and increasing; to expand capacity the buildings were rebuilt in 2006. The &quot;Lakeside&quot; suffix has occasionally been added to the name to not only reflect its location in the town of Chafford Hundred but also its proximity to the shopping centre. However, most sources including c2c and TfL, continue to simply call the station Chafford Hundred for sake of brevity.

The station became part of the Oyster card pay-as-you-go network in 2010.

==Services==
As of the June 2024 timetable the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
* 2 tph (trains per hour) westbound to London Fenchurch Street 
* 2 tph eastbound to 

According to the ORR, the station is the busiest single-platform station in the UK, beating the next busiest (Windsor and Eton Central) by some 900,000 passengers per year.

==Connections==
Ensignbus routes 33 and X80 serve the station.

A music video starring guitarist and producer Warren Fitzgerald was filmed for the band&#x27;s cover version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;. The album&#x27;s title is a euphemism for dried semen on a casting couch. Its original cover art used lettering that parodied the logo of &quot;Variety&quot;, prompting legal action and a cease and desist order from the magazine which resulted in a replacement cover with redesigned lettering. In 2010 the magazine brought further legal action against the band over third-party uses of the original cover appearing on the internet.

== Cover artwork controversy ==
The album&#x27;s cover was a source of legal controversy. A few months after the album&#x27;s release, entertainment industry magazine &quot;Variety&quot; issued a cease and desist order against The Vandals over the design of the band&#x27;s name on the album cover. The design mimicked the logo of the magazine as an intentional comment on the materialistic culture of Hollywood, and the magazine accused the band of trademark infringement. The lawsuit was settled with redesigned lettering which appears on all subsequent pressings of the album.

However, in April 2010 &quot;Variety&quot; filed a lawsuit against the band in a Delaware court, suing them over images of the original cover appearing on the internet. The magazine claimed that the band &quot;ignored their agreement&quot; and were &quot;misusing our mark&quot;. The Vandals claimed that they had ceased using the parody logo per the terms of the cease and desist order, and they were not responsible for images placed on the internet by third parties:
We agreed not to use this logo anymore and we have no product for sale with this logo so their claims that we are intentionally using it and harming the &quot;Daily Variety&quot; are ludicrous. Now they are in the process of punishing us with an abusive lawsuit filed in Delaware, where none of the parties reside or do business, because this will cause us the most financial harm and when we get sick of it, and realize we can&#x27;t afford to fight them, we will pay them the money. That is our opinion of what is going on because we cooperated in every way to try to take the images down, but they filed the suit anyway... in Delaware.

The Vandals planned a benefit show to raise money to cover their legal fees, and considered legal action against &quot;Variety&quot; to lift the injunction against use of the original logo: &quot;After reading the public filing against us by the &quot;Daily Variety&quot; it is clear they are abusing this injunction to shake us down for money, and by filing against us when there are no prohibited images on any sites under our control, they have breached the settlement agreement between us. We did not agree to be responsible for third party distributors of this product. That was clear in the settlement agreement.&quot; The band promised two tickets to the benefit to anyone who was able to notify them of a usage of the &quot;Variety&quot;-mocking logo on a site under the band&#x27;s control. In April 2011 The Vandals successfully petitioned to have the case moved from Delaware to California. The band used their website to taunt &quot;Variety&quot; lawyer Henry Horbaczewski and editor Peter Bart, saying &quot;The Plaintiffs should all be ashamed and it is the Vandals&#x27; opinion that [&quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s lawyers] are liable for malpractice damages by ruining their client&#x27;s reputation in a frivolous attempt to act like Godzilla when it comes to hoarding their precious font and inhibiting protected free speech.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; agreed to drop the case in February 2012. Bassist Joe Escalante, who has a background as an entertainment lawyer and represented The Vandals in the lawsuit, called it &quot;the worst thing that&#x27;s ever happened to me, and to the band, and the hardest thing I&#x27;ve ever done. However, the crash course in federal court litigation made me a better lawyer.&quot;

<text>The &quot;Flakpanzer&quot; IV &quot;Wirbelwind&quot; (Whirlwind in English) was a German self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier &quot;Möbelwagen&quot; self-propelled anti-aircraft gun.

==History==
In the first years of World War II, the German military forces had less interest in developing self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, but as the Allies began to gain air superiority, the need for more mobile and better-armed self-propelled anti-aircraft guns increased. During the early summer of 1944, SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Karl Wilhelm Krause with the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; came up with the concept of the &quot;Flakpanzer&quot; IV &quot;Wirbelwind&quot;. He presented the concept to SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Max Wünsche, commanding officer of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment and it was approved by Adolf Hitler.

The Panzer IV&#x27;s turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, nine-sided turret that housed a 2 cm &quot;Flakvierling&quot; 38, a quadruple mount of 20 mm cannon. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the four anti-aircraft guns. The shape of the turret earned it the nickname &quot;Keksdose&quot; (&quot;biscuit tin&quot;). Production of the tank was carried out by &quot;Ostbau Werke&quot; in Sagan, Silesia.

While the turret&#x27;s four barrels were capable of firing 2 cm shells at a high rate, it lacked range and was sometimes ineffective unless several shells hit an aircraft at once. Thus a more powerful successor, with an armament that hit harder and at longer range, was produced which eventually replaced it. Known as the &quot;Flakpanzer&quot; IV &quot;Ostwind&quot; (&quot;East Wind&quot;), the successor was equipped with a single 3.7 cm Flak 43.
The combination of armor and rapid fire from the four guns of the &quot;Wirbelwind&quot; also made it very effective against lightly armoured ground targets such as trucks and armored cars; infantry were particularly vulnerable.

Between 87 and 105 &quot;Wirbelwinds&quot; were converted from repaired Panzer IV chassis, but due to discrepancies between the recorded production numbers at Ostbau Werke and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; service records, the actual number may never be known.

<text>Amy Paulette &quot;Amii&quot; Stewart (born January 29, 1956) is an American disco and soul singer who found prominence with her 1979 U.S. Billboard number 1 hit cover of Eddie Floyd&#x27;s song &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, often considered a classic of the disco genre. Stewart scored further international hits including &quot;Light My Fire&quot; (1979) and &quot;Friends&quot; (1985). Stewart is the stepsister of actress-singer Miquel Brown and aunt to Brown&#x27;s daughter, singer Sinitta.

==Career==
Amy Stewart, the fifth of six children, was born into &quot;a big, [strictly Catholic, but] fun loving, country style family... as my mum was one of thirteen children&quot;. Her father, Joseph Stewart II, signed her up for singing and dancing lessons in 1960, when she was four years old. An Amy Stewart was already registered with the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, so she changed the spelling of her first name to Amii. She briefly enrolled in the Howard University in Washington but soon left for the Classical Repertory Dance Ensemble (CRDE) to study ballet and modern dance.

In 1975, before signing a contract at Ariola Records, Stewart worked at the touring company for the stage production of the musical revue &quot;Bubbling Brown Sugar&quot;, relocating to places of production, such as Miami, then New York city&#x27;s Broadway and eventually London&#x27;s West End, where she met Barry Leng, songwriter and record producer for Hansa Records.

The song &quot;You Really Touched My Heart&quot;, a Leng/Simon May composition and produced by Leng, was Stewart&#x27;s first recording, published by the end of 1977. An album followed, released in February 1979, which contained five Leng/May songs, one Leng/Morris song and three cover versions. The album yielded the single releases &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; and &quot;Light My Fire/137 Disco Heaven&quot;.

Stewart&#x27;s first single release, a disco cover version of the 1966 Eddie Floyd composition &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, reached number one of the U.S. Billboard single charts in April 1979 and earned her a platinum record and a Grammy Award nomination. It also ranked high in the single charts throughout Europe and reached  6 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia. Another single, a medley cover song of the Doors classic Light My Fire and &quot;137 Disco Heaven&quot;, entitled &quot;Light My Fire/137 Disco Heaven&quot; was released in the same year, entering the charts and reached No. 5 in the UK, No. 14 in Australia and No. 69 in the US.

==New trends==

By the end of the decade, disco music had, to a great extent, reached its technical limits, and growing anti-disco sentiment eventually affected the US music community. A new generation of musicians and fans, tending to idealise authenticity and purity, rejected disco as artificial, mindless and consumerist. The media, industry and markets, always intent on re-invention, were abandoning disco and feverishly scouting for new trends. 

Generally moderate US interest in Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Bird&quot; album, released in September 1979, came as no surprise. However, success and media feedback in Europe was unchanged. Europe&#x27;s music industry and scene was the sum of many small and diverse parts. New ideas would certainly be adopted but old ones preserved. Not declaring disco dead, the UK, for example, was left with a somewhat controverse culture, that fed cynicism. &quot;The rest was a mess&quot;, where punk rock and Diana Ross co-existed. &quot;Paradise Bird&quot; yielded two European single releases, &quot;Jealousy&quot; (No. 58 UK, No. 4 Italy, No. 5 Switzerland) and the double A-side &quot;The Letter/Paradise Bird&quot; (No. 39 UK 1980). Stewart, however, remained confident about her career. She told her production team and record label to be &quot;changing styles slowly, so as not get caught in the shuffle&quot;. The source of inspiration would be her artistic background in theater, modern dance and melodic music.

Following her success in Europe, Stewart relocated to Italy in the mid-1980s. and released the recordings &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Together&quot;, produced in collaboration with Italian composer/musician Mike Francis. &quot;Friends&quot; was a big hit in the UK, Italy and the Philippines.

==Later career==

In the 1998 movie &quot;54&quot;, actress/singer Mary Griffin portrayed Stewart, performing the song &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, at the famed discothèque Studio 54 in New York City. While performing, Griffin wore an apparently very similar extravagant outfit (and particularly the headgear) to that which Stewart wore in the &quot;official&quot; video to &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; in 1979. Although it was obvious that Griffin was portraying Stewart, the credits at the end of the movie have Griffin&#x27;s character listed as &quot;Disco Star&quot;.

In 2000, Stewart toured Italy, playing the part of Mary Magdalene, in a revival of the rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. The play also starred Carl Anderson, who revived his role of Judas Iscariot from the 1973 movie.

In 2004, Stewart published the studio album &quot;Lady Day&quot;, containing sixteen cast recordings of the 2003 musical &quot;Lady Day&quot;, based on the life of American jazz and blues singer Billie Holiday and produced and co-written by Stewart and theater director Massimo Romeo Piparo. Stewart, starring as Holiday, states: &quot;The idea for the musical was born from my passion for the wonderful voice of the &#x27;Queen of Swing&#x27;, but also for the music of the 1930s and 1940s and for the black renaissance of the time, of which she was the protagonist.&quot; and further: &quot;In that period of racism the foundations were laid for the rebirth not only of Blacks, but also of world music.&quot;

Since 2001, Stewart has been working as a goodwill ambassador for Unicef Italia and has been involved in numerous projects such as &quot;Uniti per i bambini, Uniti contro l&#x27;AIDS&quot; (&quot;United for the children, united against AIDS&quot;). In 2006, she recorded the charity single &quot;Love Song&quot; for UNICEF in four different languages, once again returning to work with Ennio Morricone. The following year saw her return to duet with Mike Francis on the track &quot;Nothing Can Come Between Us&quot;. In 2006, Stewart and long-time friend and collaborator Ennio Morricone released the 5 track single &quot;Love Song&quot;, sung in English, Italian, French, Spanish as well as a multilingual version. All proceeds from the single went to Unicef&#x27;s campaign &quot;Check Out For Children&quot;.

In May 2007, Stewart again participated in the Sanremo Music Festival, performing the duet &quot;Schiavo D&#x27;Amore&quot; with Piero Mazzocchetti.

In 2014, she took part in the prime-time Rai TV show &quot;La Pista&quot; as teamleader of the &quot;Virality&quot; dance troupe. Stewart and the dance team became the overall competition winners. Other well known singer-contestants included Tony Hadley and Sabrina Salerno.

Stewart has been greatly affected by Italy, and living in Rome since the mid-1980s, has become fluent in Italian. UNICEF Italia introduces her in a mutually cordial tone, pointing out: &quot;The one between Amii Stewart and Italy is a beautiful love story&quot; and that she &quot;has been &#x27;adopted&#x27; by our country and has certainly returned the affection received&quot;.

<text>The Atlantic sea nettle (&quot;Chrysaora quinquecirrha&quot;), also called the East Coast sea nettle in the United States, is a species of jellyfish that inhabits the Atlantic coast of the United States. Historically it was confused with several &quot;Chrysaora&quot; species, resulting in incorrect reports of &quot;C. quinquecirrha&quot; from other parts of the Atlantic and other oceans. Most recently, &quot;C. chesapeakei&quot; of estuaries on the Atlantic coast of the United States, as well as the Gulf of Mexico, was only fully recognized as separate from &quot;C. quinquecirrha&quot; in 2017. It is smaller than the Pacific sea nettle, and has more variable coloration, but is typically pale, pinkish or yellowish, often with radiating more deeply colored stripes on the exumbrella, especially near the margin.

==Description==
The medusae of &quot;C. quinquecirrha&quot; measures up to in diameter. The sea nettle is radially symmetrical, marine, and carnivorous. Its mouth is located at the center of one end of the body, which opens to a gastrovascular cavity that is used for digestion. It has tentacles that surround the mouth to capture food. Sea nettles have no excretory or respiratory organs. Each sea nettle is either in a free-swimming stage or a polyp stage. The free-swimming stage, or medusa stage reproduces sexually, and the polyp stage reproduces asexually.

The Atlantic sea nettle is a bell-shaped invertebrate, usually semi-transparent and with small, white dots and reddish-brown stripes. Sea nettles without stripes have a bell that appears white or opaque. The sea nettle&#x27;s sting is rated from &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;severe&quot; and can be noxious to smaller prey; it is not, however, potent enough to cause human death, except by allergic reaction. While the sting is not particularly harmful, it can cause moderate discomfort to any individual stung. The sting can be effectively neutralized by misting vinegar over the affected area. This keeps unfired nematocysts from firing and adding to the discomfort.

==Feeding habits==
Stinging sea nettles are carnivorous. They generally feed on zooplankton, ctenophores, other jellies, and sometimes crustaceans. Sea nettles immobilize and obtain their prey using their stinging tentacles. After that, the prey is transported to the gastrovascular cavity where it is subsequently digested.

Sea nettles are also able to consume minnows, bay anchovy eggs, worms, and mosquito larvae.

==Defense mechanisms==
Each sea nettle tentacle is coated with thousands of microscopic cnidocytes; in turn, every individual cnidocyte has a &quot;trigger&quot; (cnidocil) paired with a capsule containing a coiled stinging filament. Upon contact, the cnidocil will immediately initiate a process which ejects the venom-coated filament from its capsule and into the target. This will inject toxins capable of killing smaller prey or stunning perceived predators. On humans, this will most likely cause a nonlethal, but nevertheless painful rash typically persisting for about 20 minutes. Some earlier cases of sea nettle stings from the Philippines reportedly had more severe effects: one account describes a sting causing vascular insufficiency, and another mononeuritis.

Rather than toxic substances, some cnidocytes contain adhesion used to entangle or anchor its target.

== Predators ==
The defense mechanisms of the sea nettle reduces the amount of natural predators. The Atlantic sea nettle is prey to mainly sea turtles, ocean sunfish, and larger jellyfish.

<text>Prosper Garnot (13 January 1794 – 8 October 1838) was a French surgeon and naturalist.

Garnot was born at Brest. He was an assistant surgeon under Louis Isidore Duperrey on &quot;La Coquille&quot; during its circumnavigation of the globe (1822–1825). Along with René Primevère Lesson he collected numerous natural history specimens in South America and the Pacific. Garnot had a severe attack of dysentery and was sent back with some of the collection on the &quot;Castle Forbes&quot;. The specimens were lost when the ship was wrecked off the Cape of Good Hope in July 1824. With Lesson he wrote the zoological section of the voyage&#x27;s report, &quot;Voyage autour du monde exécuté par order du roi sur la corvette La Coquille&quot; (1828–1832). He died, aged 44, in Paris.

The widely distributed parthenogenetic Indo-Pacific house gecko &quot;Hemidactylus garnotii&quot; , was named in his honour.

<text>Kenneth Jinghwa Hsu () Ph.D., M.A., born 28 June 1929, is a Chinese scientist, geologist, paleoclimatologist, oceanographer, government advisor, author, inventor and entrepreneur who was born in Nanjing, China.

==Biography==

Education

Hsu (Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.) studied at the Chinese National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University in mainland China and reinstated in Taiwan) (B.Sc. 1948), and came to the United States in 1948 where he studied at Ohio State University (M.A., 1950), and at University of California, Los Angeles, where he received his Ph.D. in 1953.

Professional life

Hsu initially worked as a petroleum geologist for the Shell Development Corporation, now called Shell Oil Company, in Houston, Texas, US, between 1954 and 1963. He was associate professor at two universities in the USA between 1963 and 1967, before becoming professor of geology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zürich) between 1967 and 1994, where he promoted experimental geology and built up 5 leading international laboratories in the fields of rock mechanics (geophysics), mass-spectrometry (isotope geochemistry), Quaternary research (paleoclimatology), sedimentology and tectonics. It was after his retirement from University teaching that Hsu started to work in environmental engineering.

Professorships &amp; lectureships

While Hsu was professor at the Institute of Geology, ETH Zurich between 1967 and 1994, he was invited as lecturer, guest or honorary professor in geology, climatology or oceanography to numerous renowned universities of the world, including Beijing, California (San Diego), Cambridge, Columbia, Florence, Harvard, London, Milan, M.I.T., Moscow, Nanjing, Naples, Ohio, Oxford, Paris, Princeton, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Washington, Woods Hole, Yale etc.

After retirement in 1994, he was guest professor at the National Taiwan University (1994–95), senior fellow at the Berlin Institute of Advanced Studies (1995–96), Keck Professor at Colorado School of Mines, guest professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, university professor at Nanjing University, and university professor at Beijing University of Geosciences.

==Scientific contributions==

Academic work

Hsu participated in the Earth Science Revolution of the 1960s, consolidating Plate Tectonics Theory, and has throughout his life been active in so-called &#x27;Process Oriented Geology&#x27;, which is in conversation with the evolutionary biology (symbiogenesis) of Lynn Margulis, the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock, and others. Instead of being preoccupied with rocks and mirrors, Hsu treated geological problems as arising from physical, chemical and biological processes, and hence has been a stout promoter of an educational reform in geology, emphasizing the fundamental principles of earth physics, chemistry and biology.

In geology, his work included sedimentation in isostatically driven tectonic basins, the active margins of continental plates, physical chemistry of evaporite and pelagic diagenesis, documentation of granulite formation, catastrophic consequences of meteorite impacts, extinction of life forms and the limnology of Lake Zurich.

Scientific expeditions and explorations

Hsu participated and led 5 deep-sea drilling cruises to the South Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Black Sea. He also led several international expeditions to Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, South China, California Coast Ranges and the Swiss Alps, travelling to 80 countries for Earth Science.

Awards

For his contributions to geology, Hsu received several medals and awards.

*Wollaston Medal from The Geological Society of London (considered the highest honor in Geology, or an equivalent to the Nobel Prize in Geology) in 1984 (formerly presented to Charles Lyell, Thomas Henry Huxley, Charles Darwin and James Lovelock).
*Penrose Medal from The Geological Society of America in 2001 (the highest honor by the Society).
*President&#x27;s Special Award, American Association of Petroleum Geologists (resulting in Hsu being listed in Who&#x27;s Who in Trade &amp; Industry)

Appreciation

Two Festschrift symposia books, &quot;Controversies in Geology&quot;, and &quot;Paradoxes in Geology&quot;, were published by Hsu&#x27;s colleagues on his 60th and 70th birthdays. In September 2009, his contributions to China and to science were acknowledged at a conference in Beijing, attended by dignitaries from government, industry and academia.

==Entrepreneurial activities==

Enterprise

After his retirement, Hsu made several inventions in mining, oil, water and energy technology, and founded various companies including Tarim Resource Recycling Limited (UK, 2003); Kenneth Hsu IHC Technology &amp; Development Limited (China, 2005) and Lazarus Energy International Limited (UK, 2007).

Inventions

Hsu was awarded 16 patents in mining, petroleum, water, carbon, energy and environment management, including the Hydro-Transistor and Integrated Hydrologic Circuit (IHC).

Hsu&#x27;s technologies applied in China included:
*3-D Enhanced Oil Recovery of the world&#x27;s residual oil reserves;
*Lithium Production from brine lakes and sea water to empower hybrid vehicles;
*Water Availability by waste water recycling and rainwater harvesting to eliminate shortages;
*Nitrite-Free Drinking Water scientifically demonstrated to reduce the cancer mortality rate by half;
*Nitrite-Free Sewage-Treatment Works to denitritize the drinking water supply;
*Lake Rehabilitation by eliminating algal pollution through sequestering of carbon dioxide;
*Biofuel Generation by utilizing carbon dioxide emissions to mitigate the burning of fossil fuels;
*Capillary Irrigation to conserve water whilst reclaiming land without utilizing surface irrigation;
*Land Reclamation and Desert Greening by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide;
*Hydro-Electricity without building hydro-electric dams.

Endorsements

After extensive research and development, Hsu&#x27;s water technologies were unanamiously endorsed by an expert panel called by the Chinese State Counsellors&#x27; Office (Civilian Chief of Staff) of the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao; and by Nobel Laureate Samuel Ting, and University of California Chancellor, Henry Yang, who both served on the Chinese Premiere&#x27;s KHC Advisory Board.

In 2000, Hsu combined the newly developed enhanced oil recovery techniques of hydro-fracturing and horizontal drilling, with water flooding, to invent a totally new process of residual oil recovery (ROR), called 3-dimensional fluid injection, to exploit residual oil. The method utilized water rather than carbon dioxide, although carbon dioxide can also be used in the process. Hsu suggested the technique could increase the recoverable petroleum reserve of the world by a factor of 50% or more. 

With the full support of the Chinese Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, in February 2006, an Expert Panel called by former Petroleum Minister Dr Wang Tao, unanimously agreed Hsu&#x27;s ROR invention was innovative, and should be tested and applied in China. In April 2006, PetroChina reported a successful test at the Changqing Oil Field (Northwest China), first discovered in 1907. Prior to the test, its annual production was about 10,000 tons. In 2006, this rose to 10 million tons, and in 2007, to 20 million tons.

Ventures

Hsu is active with institutions, organizations and corporations to apply the new technologies in China and internationally.

Consultancy

Hsu is president of the IHC Technology &amp; Development Corporation (China), senior advisor and chief engineer to the Kenneth Hsu Institute for IHC Development (National Institute Of Earth Sciences, Beijing) and director of the Center for Environmental &amp; Health Engineering (Henan University, Kaifeng). His work on the link between nitrite in drinking water and cancer was documented in &quot;The Ecologist&quot; journal.

==Notable writings==

Hsu authored or edited over 20 books, many in multiple languages, and was elected an International Writer of the Year by the International Book Club (Cambridge, UK) in 2003.

The Mediterranean Was A Desert, 1982

The book concerned Hsu&#x27;s work deciphering the Messinian Salinity Crisis and provided a first-hand account of one of the most significant deep-sea drilling cruises ever launched. The voyage, Leg 13 of the D/V Glomar Challenger, was undertaken in 1970 and led to the hypothesis that 5.5 million years ago, the Mediterranean was a desert. It documented the adventures of the oceanographic expedition and offered portraits of &#x27;big&#x27; science and &#x27;big&#x27; scientists at work, with human touches, as a memoir for historians of science. The book was selected by Philip Morrison of Scientific American as one of the 100 most significant and influential books of science in the 20th century. A film was also made by PBS, based on the book.

Challenger At Sea, 1983

The book was an overview of the then current state of marine geology and a source book for the history of that science, and was used as a geology textbook for non-majors.

The Great Dying, 1986

The book described the circumstances leading to the discovery that the dinosaur extinction was triggered by a cometary impact. An inquiry into the nature of survival and extinction, it was published in 6 languages, selling over 170,000 copies worldwide, selling 28,000 copies in the United States between 1986 and 1988; 100,000 copies in mainland China in 1989 and 40,000 copies in Taiwan. A popular newspaper in Taipei &quot;United Post&quot; featured &quot;The Great Dying&quot; in its weekly list of best-selling books list for more than a year, and it was chosen as a top non-fiction book of the year in August 1992. Originally intended to teach the public, the book was used as a textbook in the United States for its scientific method. A film was also made based on the book by ZDF.

In the book, Hsu marshalled &quot;some of the most gripping and controversial geological discoveries of our time to blast Darwin’s claim and to shake the foundations of his evolutionary theory,&quot; showing evidence indicating a meteor collided with the Earth, 66 million years ago, leaving much of it uninhabitable, and warning that a similar event may threaten humanity in the future.

Hsu criticized Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection. According to Hsu &quot;If most extinctions are caused by catastrophes... then chance, not superiority, presides over who shall live and who shall die. Indeed, the whole course of evolution may be governed by chance, and not reflect at all the slow march from inferior to superior forms so beloved by Victorians, and so deeply embedded in Western thought.&quot; The book endorses catastrophism and non-Darwinian evolution.

Klima Macht Geschichte, 2000

&quot;Klima Macht Geschichte&quot; presented a theory of climate and history, looking at future climate changes based on historical, archaeological and helio-biological evidence. It made the prediction of global cooling of the planet in the last decades of the 21st century, and the coming of a little ice age before 2500. The claim forecast was corroborated by scientists Khabibullo Abdusamatov, Yuk Yung, John Cassey, Nigel Calder, Henrik Svensmark, Alexander Chizhevsky and John D. Hamaker . Orell Fussli Verlag published the book after an article about Hsu appeared in Bilanz Magazine in 1998. Earlier, in 1992, Hsu wrote in &quot;Geographical Magazine&quot;, &quot;Perhaps our species was created by Gaia to prevent a catastrophic chill&quot; in reference to his published paper &quot;&#x27;Is Gaia Endothermic?&quot;, on which the book is also based.

Amadeus &amp; Magdalena, 2002

Published in Chinese, English and German, with a Chinese translation titled &quot;莫扎特的愛與死&quot;., the book presented Hsu&#x27;s musicological theory about the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

<text>MYCIN was an early backward chaining expert system that used artificial intelligence to identify bacteria causing severe infections, such as bacteremia and meningitis, and to recommend antibiotics, with the dosage adjusted for patient&#x27;s body weight — the name derived from the antibiotics themselves, as many antibiotics have the suffix &quot;-mycin&quot;. The Mycin system was also used for the diagnosis of blood clotting diseases.
MYCIN was developed over five or six years in the early 1970s at Stanford University. It was written in Lisp as the doctoral dissertation of Edward Shortliffe under the direction of Bruce G. Buchanan, Stanley N. Cohen and others.

MYCIN led to the EMYCIN expert system shell (&quot;essential MYCIN&quot;) for acquiring knowledge, reasoning with it, and explaining the results, without the specific medical knowledge. It can be described as &quot;EMYCIN = Prolog + uncertainty + caching + questions + explanations + contexts - variables&quot;. An introduction is in Chapter 16 of &quot;Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming&quot; (PAIP).

==Method==
MYCIN operated using a fairly simple inference engine and a knowledge base of ~600 rules. It would query the physician running the program via a long series of simple yes/no or textual questions. At the end, it provided a list of possible culprit bacteria ranked from high to low based on the probability of each diagnosis, its confidence in each diagnosis&#x27; probability, the reasoning behind each diagnosis (that is, MYCIN would also list the questions and rules which led it to rank a diagnosis a particular way), and its recommended course of drug treatment.

Samuel Clark sparked debate about the use of its ad hoc, but principled, uncertainty framework known as &quot;certainty factors&quot;. Certainty factors were designed to deal with disbelief/belief, but they do not deal with probabilistic dependence/independence, and they are not probabilities.

The developers performed studies showing that MYCIN&#x27;s performance was minimally affected by perturbations in the uncertainty metrics associated with individual rules, suggesting that the power in the system was related more to its knowledge representation and reasoning scheme than to the details of its numerical uncertainty model. Some observers felt that it should have been possible to use classical Bayesian statistics. MYCIN&#x27;s developers argued that this would require either unrealistic assumptions of probabilistic independence, or require the experts to provide estimates for an unfeasibly large number of conditional probabilities.

Subsequent studies later showed that the certainty factor model could indeed be interpreted in a probabilistic sense, and highlighted problems with the implied assumptions of such a model. However the modular structure of the system would prove very successful, leading to the development of graphical models such as Bayesian networks.

=== Context ===
A context in MYCIN determines what types of objects can be reasoned about. They are similar to variables in Prolog, or environment variables in operating systems.
(defun mycin ()
 &quot;Determine what organism is infecting a patient.&quot;
 (emycin
 (list (defcontext patient (name sex age) ())
 (defcontext culture (site days-old) ())
 (defcontext organism () (identity)))))

===Evidence combination===

In MYCIN it was possible that two or more rules might draw conclusions about a parameter with different weights of evidence. For example, one rule may conclude that the organism in question is &quot;E. Coli&quot; with a certainty of 0.8 whilst another concludes that it is &quot;E. Coli&quot; with a certainty of 0.5 or even -0.8. In the event the certainty is less than zero the evidence is actually against the hypothesis. In order to calculate the certainty factor MYCIN combined these weights using the formula below to yield a single certainty factor:

: formula_1

Where X and Y are the certainty factors. This formula can be applied more than once if more than two rules draw conclusions about the same parameter. It is commutative, so it does not matter in which order the weights were combined.

The combination formula was designed to have the following desirable properties:

* -1 can be interpreted as &quot;false&quot;, +1 as &quot;true&quot;, and 0 as &quot;uncertain&quot;.
* Combining &quot;unknown&quot; with anything leaves it unchanged.
* Combining &quot;true&quot; with anything (except &quot;false&quot;) gives &quot;true&quot;. Similarly for &quot;false&quot;.
* Combining &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; is a division-by-zero error.
* Combining +x and -x gives &quot;unknown&quot;.
* Combining two positives (except &quot;true&quot;) gives a larger positive. Similarly for negatives.
* Combining a positive and a negative gives something in between.

=== Examples ===
The following examples come from Chapter 16 of PAIP, which contains an implementation in Common Lisp of a modified and simplified version of MYCIN for pedagogical purposes.

A rule, and an English paraphrase generated by the system:
(defrule 52
 if (site culture is blood)
 (gram organism is neg)
 (morphology organism is rod)
 (burn patient is serious)
 then .4
 (identity organism is pseudomonas))
Rule 52:
 If
 1) THE SITE OF THE CULTURE IS BLOOD
 2) THE GRAM OF THE ORGANISM IS NEG
 3) THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE ORGANISM IS ROD
 4) THE BURN OF THE PATIENT IS SERIOUS
 Then there is weakly suggestive evidence (0.4) that
 1) THE IDENTITY OF THE ORGANISM IS PSEUDOMONAS
==Results==
Research conducted at the Stanford Medical School found MYCIN received an acceptability rating of 65% on treatment plan from a panel of eight independent specialists, which was comparable to the 42.5% to 62.5% rating of five faculty members. This study is often cited as showing the potential for disagreement about therapeutic decisions, even among experts, when there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; for correct treatment.

==Practical use==
MYCIN was never actually used in practice. This wasn&#x27;t because of any weakness in its performance. Some observers raised ethical and legal issues related to the use of computers in medicine, regarding the responsibility of the physicians in case the system gave wrong diagnosis. However, the greatest problem, and the reason that MYCIN was not used in routine practice, was the state of technologies for system integration, especially at the time it was developed. MYCIN was a stand-alone system that required a user to enter all relevant information about a patient by typing in responses to questions MYCIN posed. The program ran on a large time-shared system, available over the early Internet (ARPANet), before personal computers were developed. 

MYCIN&#x27;s greatest influence was accordingly its demonstration of the power of its representation and reasoning approach. Rule-based systems in many non-medical domains were developed in the years that followed MYCIN&#x27;s introduction of the approach. In the 1980s, expert system &quot;shells&quot; were introduced (including one based on MYCIN, known as E-MYCIN (followed by Knowledge Engineering Environment - KEE)) and supported the development of expert systems in a wide variety of application areas.
A difficulty that rose to prominence during the development of MYCIN and subsequent complex expert systems has been the extraction of the necessary knowledge for the inference engine to use from the human expert in the relevant fields into the rule base (the so-called &quot;knowledge acquisition bottleneck&quot;).

<text>Mall of Arabia was a planned shopping mall; that would have been a part of the City of Arabia in the Dubailand theme park premises in Dubai. Original announcements said it would be completed in 2008. Following the collapse of the Dubai real-estate market, the mall&#x27;s opening has been delayed. In 2016, in favor of IMG Worlds of Adventure&#x27;s opening date, it was announced that the mall will be revived within 10 years. According to the developers the 10 million square-foot mall would contain more than 1,000 retail outlets, a rooftop hotel, waterfront dining and entertainment, a theme park, an earth science museum, and a planetarium. It would also contain its own monorail system linked with the Dubai Metro along with a two-story underground parking garage capable of holding 10,400 vehicles.

<text>Rafael Tobías Hernández Alvarado (born November 30, 1958) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball catcher. He played briefly for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB) in its 1984 season.

Hernández was regarded as a good-fielding, light-hitting catcher in the Jays organization, but after a long history of injuries he was able to reach the majors just at 31. In his brief stint at Toronto, he went 1-for-2 and scored a run in three games.

Additionally, he posted a .223 average with 11 home runs and 122 RBI in parts of seven minor league seasons between 1979 and 1985.

In between, Hernández played winter ball with the Cardenales de Lara club of the Venezuelan League in a span of 14 seasons from 1978 through 1991.

<doc id="649938" wikidata="Q131627" url="?curid=649938" title="Puntius">
<text>Puntius is a genus of small freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae native to South Asia and Mainland Southeast Asia, as well as Taiwan.

Many species formerly placed in &quot;Puntius&quot; have been moved to other genera such as &quot;Barbodes&quot;, &quot;Dawkinsia&quot;, &quot;Desmopuntius&quot;, &quot;Haludaria&quot;, &quot;Oliotius&quot;, &quot;Pethia&quot;, &quot;Puntigrus&quot;, &quot;Sahyadria&quot; and &quot;Systomus&quot;.

Previously, it was assumed that the earliest record of this genus was the fossil species &quot;Puntius bussyi&quot; from the Eocene of Sumatra, but a 2020 study reclassified this species into the new genus &quot;Pauciuncus&quot;, possibly in the subfamily Smiliogastrinae.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Puntius&quot; comes from &quot;Pungti&quot; (Pronounced &quot;Puti&quot;), a Bangla term for small cyprinids.

==Range==
Fishes of the genus &quot;Puntius&quot; are found in South Asia (west to Pakistan and south to Sri Lanka) and Mainland Southeast Asia, with a single species, &quot;P. snyderi&quot;, in Taiwan. The greatest species richness is in India.

==Description==
The maximum size for an adult of this genus is , but most species reach and some species do not surpass . In appearance they may resemble miniature carp and are sometimes brightly coloured or patterned.

==Behavior==
These fishes are omnivorous; their diet includes small invertebrates and plant matter. Breeding is by egg scattering and takes place close to the bottom, near or within areas of dense plant growth. They do not show parental care and adults may eat the young.

==Taxonomy==
Historically, many species of &quot;Puntius&quot; have been classified in several genera, including &quot;Barbus&quot;. Despite the reclassifications, the specific epithet remains the same in these – except in cases of homonymies – as &quot;Barbus&quot; and &quot;Puntius&quot; have the same grammatical gender. The closest living relatives of the spotted barbs are the genus &quot;Cyprinion&quot; and perhaps the genus &quot;Capoeta&quot;. These and the other &quot;typical&quot; barbs and barbels were formerly often separated as subfamily Barbinae, but this group is highly paraphyletic with regard to the Cyprininae and better merged there at least for the largest part (including &quot;Puntius&quot;). In particular the genus &quot;Barbonymus&quot;, containing the tinfoil barb and its relatives – for some time included in &quot;Puntius&quot; – appears to be a kind of carp that has evolved convergently with barbs.

This genus is classified within the subfamily Smiliogastrinae by &quot;Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes&quot;.

==Species==
These are the currently recognized species in this genus:

* &quot;Puntius ambassis&quot;

<text>The two-factor theory (also known as Herzberg&#x27;s motivation-hygiene theory and dual-factor theory) states that there are certain factors in the that cause job satisfaction while a separate set of factors cause , all of which act independently of each other. It was developed by psychologist Frederick Herzberg.

==Fundamentals==
Feelings, attitudes and their connection with industrial mental health are related to Abraham Maslow&#x27;s theory of motivation. His findings have had a considerable theoretical, as well as a practical, influence on attitudes toward administration. According to Herzberg, individuals are not content with the satisfaction of lower-order needs at work; for example, those needs associated with minimum salary levels or safe and pleasant working conditions. Rather, individuals look for the gratification of higher-level psychological needs having to do with achievement, recognition, responsibility, advancement, and the nature of the work itself. This appears to parallel Maslow&#x27;s theory of a need hierarchy. However, Herzberg added a new dimension to this theory by proposing a two-factor model of motivation, based on the notion that the presence of one set of job characteristics or incentives leads to worker &quot;satisfaction&quot; at work, while another and separate set of job characteristics leads to &quot;dissatisfaction&quot; at work. Thus, satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not on a continuum with one increasing as the other diminishes, but are independent phenomena. This theory suggests that to improve job attitudes and productivity, administrators must recognize and attend to both sets of characteristics and not assume that an increase in satisfaction leads to decrease in dissatisfaction.

The two-factor theory developed from data collected by Herzberg from interviews with 203 engineers and accountants in the Pittsburgh area, chosen because of their professions&#x27; growing importance in the business world. Regarding the collection process:

From analyzing these interviews, he found that job characteristics related to what an individual &quot;does&quot; — that is, to the nature of the work one performs — apparently have the capacity to gratify such needs as achievement, competency, status, personal worth, and self-realization, thus making him happy and satisfied. However, the &quot;absence&quot; of such gratifying job characteristics does not appear to lead to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Instead, dissatisfaction results from unfavorable assessments of such job-related factors as company policies, supervision, technical problems, salary, interpersonal relations on the job, and working conditions. Thus, if management wishes to increase satisfaction on the job, it should be concerned with the nature of the work itself — the opportunities it presents for gaining status, assuming responsibility, and for achieving self-realization. If, on the other hand, management wishes to reduce dissatisfaction, then it must focus on the workplace environment — policies, procedures, supervision, and working conditions. If management is equally concerned with both, then managers must give attention to both sets of job factors.

Two-factor theory distinguishes between:
* Motivators (e.g. challenging work, recognition for one&#x27;s achievement, responsibility, opportunity to do something meaningful, involvement in decision making, sense of importance to an organization) that give positive satisfaction, arising from intrinsic conditions of the job itself, such as recognition, achievement, or personal growth.

*Hygiene factors (e.g. status, job security, salary, fringe benefits, work conditions, good pay, paid insurance, vacations) that do not give positive satisfaction or lead to higher motivation, though dissatisfaction results from their absence. The term &quot;hygiene&quot; is used in the sense that these are maintenance factors. These are extrinsic to the work itself, and include aspects such as company policies, supervisory practices, or wages/salary. Herzberg often referred to hygiene factors as &quot;KITA&quot; factors, which is an acronym for &quot;kick in the ass&quot;, the process of providing incentives or threat of punishment to make someone do something.

According to Herzberg, the absence of hygiene factors causes dissatisfaction among employees in the workplace. However, their presence does not ensure satisfaction entirely. There are several ways that this can be done but some of the most important ways to decrease dissatisfaction would be to pay reasonable wages, ensure employees job security, and to create a positive culture in the workplace. Herzberg considered the following hygiene factors from highest to lowest importance: company policy, supervision, employee&#x27;s relationship with their boss, work conditions, salary, and relationships with peers. Eliminating dissatisfaction is only one half of the task of the two factor theory. The other half would be to increase satisfaction in the workplace. This can be done by improving on motivating factors. Motivation factors are needed to motivate an employee to higher performance. Herzberg also further classified our actions and how and why we do them, for example, if you perform a work related action because you &quot;have&quot; to then that is classed as &quot;movement&quot;, but if you perform a work related action because you &quot;want&quot; to then that is classed as &quot;motivation&quot;. Herzberg thought it was important to eliminate job dissatisfaction before going onto creating conditions for job satisfaction because it would work against each other. Satisfaction of the employees can have multiple positive effects for the organization. For example, when the employees share their knowledge, they satisfy their social needs and gain cohesion within the group. Also, sharing knowledge helps others to create new knowledge, which also can reinforce the motivating factors. By sharing knowledge, the employees feel satisfied and with the new knowledge it can increase the organizations innovation activities. 

According to the two-factor theory, there are four possible combinations:
#High hygiene + high motivation: The ideal situation where employees are highly motivated and have few complaints.
#High hygiene + low motivation: Employees have few complaints but are not highly motivated. The job is viewed as a paycheck.
#Low hygiene + high motivation: Employees are motivated but have a lot of complaints. A situation where the job is exciting and challenging but salaries and work conditions are not up to par.
#Low hygiene + low motivation: This is the worst situation where employees are not motivated and have many complaints.

Unlike Maslow, who offered little data to support his ideas, Herzberg and others have presented considerable empirical evidence to confirm the motivation-hygiene theory, although their work has been criticized on methodological grounds.

==Workarounds==
Herzberg&#x27;s theory concentrates on the importance of internal job factors as motivating forces for employees. He designed it to increase job enrichment for employees. Herzberg wanted to create the opportunity for employees to take part in planning, performing, and evaluating their work. He suggested to do this by:

* Removing some of the control management has over employees and increasing the accountability and responsibility they have over their work, which would in return increase employee autonomy.
* Creating complete and natural work units where it is possible. An example would be allowing employees to create a whole unit or section instead of only allowing them to create part of it.
* Providing regular and continuous feedback on productivity and job performance directly to employees instead of through supervisors.
* Encouraging employees to take on new and challenging tasks and becoming experts at a task.

==Validity and criticisms==
In 1968 Herzberg stated that his two-factor theory study had already been replicated 16 times in a wide variety of populations, including some in Communist countries, and corroborated with studies using different procedures that agreed with his original findings regarding intrinsic employee motivation, making it one of the most widely replicated studies on job attitudes.

One such replication was done by George Hines and published in December 1973 in the &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot;. Hines tested Herzberg&#x27;s two-factor motivation theory in New Zealand, using ratings of 12 job factors and overall job satisfaction obtained from 218 middle managers and 196 salaried employees. Contrary to dichotomous motivator-hygiene predictions, supervision and interpersonal relationships were ranked highly by those with high job satisfaction, and there was strong agreement between satisfied managers and salaried employees in the relative importance of job factors. Findings are interpreted in terms of social and employment conditions in New Zealand.

While the Motivator-Hygiene concept is still well regarded, satisfaction and dissatisfaction are generally no longer considered to exist on separate scales. The separation of satisfaction and dissatisfaction has been shown to be an artifact of the critical incident technique (CIT) used by Herzberg to record events. Furthermore, it has been noted the theory does not allow for individual differences, such as particular personality traits, which would affect individuals&#x27; unique responses to motivating or hygiene factors.

A number of behavioral scientists have pointed to inadequacies in the need for hierarchy and motivation-hygiene theories. The most basic is the criticism that both of these theories contain the relatively explicit assumption that happy and satisfied workers produce more, even though this might not be the case. For example, if playing a better game of golf is the means chosen to satisfy one&#x27;s need for recognition, then one will find ways to play and think about golf more often, perhaps resulting in a lower output on the job due to a lower amount of focus..

Another problem however is that these and other statistical theories are concerned with explaining &quot;average&quot; behavior, despite considerable differences between individuals that may impact one&#x27;s motivational factors. For instance, in their pursuit of status a person might take a balanced view and strive to pursue several behavioral paths in an effort to achieve a combination of personal status objectives.

In other words, an individual&#x27;s expectation or estimated probability that a given behavior will bring a valued outcome determines their choice of means and the effort they will devote to these means. In effect, this diagram of expectancy depicts an employee asking themselves the question posed by one investigator, &quot;How much payoff is there for me toward attaining a personal goal while expending so much effort toward the achievement of an assigned organizational objective?&quot; The expectancy theory by Victor Vroom also provides a framework for motivation based on expectations.

This approach to the study and understanding of motivation would appear to have certain conceptual advantages over other theories: First, unlike Maslow&#x27;s and Herzberg&#x27;s theories, it is capable of handling individual differences. Second, its focus is toward the present and the future, in contrast to drive theory, which emphasizes past learning. Third, it specifically correlates behavior to a goal and thus eliminates the problem of assumed relationships, such as between motivation and performance. Fourth, it relates motivation to ability:

:Performance = Motivation * Ability.

A study by the Gallup Organization, as detailed in the book &quot;First, Break All the Rules: What the World&#x27;s Greatest Managers Do&quot; by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman, appears to provide strong support for Herzberg&#x27;s division of satisfaction and dissatisfaction onto two separate scales. In this book, the authors discuss how the study identified twelve questions that provide a framework for determining high-performing individuals and organizations. These twelve questions align squarely with Herzberg&#x27;s motivation factors, while hygiene factors were determined to have little effect on motivating high performance.

<text>Margaret DeBardeleben Tutwiler (born December 28, 1950) is an American politician who has served multiple different positions within the United States Department of State.

==Early life and career==
Tutwiler was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the daughter of Temple Tutwiler II and Margaret (DeBardeleben) Tutwiler. She attended Finch College in Manhattan and the University of Alabama. She was offered a job as the secretary of the chairman of the Alabama Republican Party following her graduation.

At age 26, she worked under James A. Baker III in Gerald Ford’s unsuccessful 1976 presidential campaign. In 1980, she was one of a team of relatively younger aides assembled by Baker to run Bush’s campaign for the presidential nomination. When Bush lost the nomination to Ronald Reagan, Reagan tapped Baker to run his presidential campaign, and Baker brought Tutwiler with him to the campaign.

==Reagan White House==
When Reagan won the presidency and Baker became White House Chief of Staff, Tutwiler asked to accompany him, saying, &quot;Until we figure it out, can’t I just be your jack of all trades?&quot; Once they were ensconced in the White House, one of Tutwiler&#x27;s duties was to return phone calls from members of congress, or the press, if Baker could not himself return the call.

Gradually, Tutwiler became known as Baker&#x27;s right hand and alter ego. In the run-up to the 1984 election, Baker installed Tutwiler as liaison at Reagan&#x27;s re-election campaign, in part to keep an eye on Ed Rollins, who had left his position as Assistant to the President for Political Affairs and became chair of the campaign, and who was critical of Baker.

In January 1985, after Reagan won the 1984 election, he appointed Baker as Secretary of the Treasury, and Baker took his White House team with him to the Treasury, where Tutwiler became Baker&#x27;s chief political assistant, initially holding the position of Assistant Secretary For Public Affairs.

==H.W. Bush White House==
In 1989, after George H. W. Bush was elected president, Baker became Secretary of State, and Tutwiler moved with him to the State Department as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs—although she had to be convinced to take the position, because it involved daily briefings on matters with which she was not yet familiar.

In June 1989, when protests erupted in Beijing&#x27;s Tiananmen Square, the Bush administration was concerned that a strong condemnation from the U.S. might damage the rapprochement with China which had begun during the Nixon administration, and impair the ability of the U.S. to use China as a counterweight in its geopolitical struggle with the Soviet Union. As Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, Tutwiler was in charge of press and public briefings conducted by the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Public Affairs. She objected to the administration&#x27;s position regarding the protests, and urged Baker to speak out against the Chinese government&#x27;s crackdown on protesters. Initially, she refused to conduct briefings supporting the administration&#x27;s position. To overcome her scruples, Baker had to personally insist that she conduct the briefings.

It was Tutwiler who urged Baker to invite Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to accompany him on a trip to his ranch in Wyoming, which would provide an opportunity for the two men to become better acquainted. The trip took place in September, 1989.

President Bush met Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev for a summit in Malta on December 2–3, 1989. Tutwiler was part of the State Department party who travelled to Malta for the summit.

On August 13, 1992, President Bush announced that Baker was leaving the State Department, and returning to the White House as White House Chief of Staff, and would run Bush&#x27;s re-election campaign. Tutwiler was one of the advisers who moved back to the White House with him. After Bush lost his bid for re-election, William Barr, then the Attorney General, appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether the Bush campaign had sought information from Bill Clinton&#x27;s passport files. No charges were filed, but Tutwiler and other aides had to find lawyers to represent them during the investigation.

In 1996, Baker considered running for president against Clinton. One of the people from whom he sought advice on whether to run was Tutwiler. Tutwiler also read and critiqued drafts of Baker&#x27;s memoir.

==2000 election and W. Bush White House==
When the result of the 2000 United States presidential election in Florida was in doubt, Baker became the head of the George W. Bush&#x27;s legal team in the state. One of the first things Baker did was to phone Tutwiler and ask her to mobilize his aides and go to Florida. Tutwiler was installed in a corner office near Baker&#x27;s office in the state Republican Party building.

On August 25, 2002, prior to the second Iraq war, the New York Times published a column by Baker urging the President to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to compel Iraq to submit to international inspection. Tutwiler urged Baker to take a harder line against a war, but Baker declined to publicly criticize the approach taken by the White House.

During the administration of George W. Bush, Tutwiler was Ambassador to Morocco from March 2001 until 2003, when she became Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, serving from December 16, 2003, to June 30, 2004. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 9, 2003, to replace outgoing Under Secretary Charlotte Beers. Tutwiler was given the task of leading &quot;the government&#x27;s public-relations drive to build a favorable impression abroad.&quot;

==Private sector work==
In July 2004, she began directing communications for NYSE Euronext. Her boss at the NYSE, John Thain, later brought her on board as head of communications at Merrill Lynch in December 2007 and then at CIT Group in August 2010.

Tutwiler is a member of the board of directors of the International Republican Institute.

<doc id="649954" wikidata="Q326704" url="?curid=649954" title="FIFA (video game series)">
<text>FIFA is a discontinued football video game franchise developed by EA Vancouver and EA Romania and published by EA Sports. As of 2011, the &quot;FIFA&quot; franchise has been localized into 18 languages and available in 51 countries. Listed in Guinness World Records as the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world, the &quot;FIFA&quot; series has sold over 325 million copies as of 2021. On 10 May 2022, it was announced that EA and FIFA&#x27;s partnership of 30 years would come to an end upon the termination of their licensing agreement, making &quot;FIFA 23&quot; the last entry to the franchise under the &quot;FIFA&quot; name. As a successor to the &quot;FIFA&quot; series, EA launched the &quot;EA Sports FC&quot; franchise, with &quot;EA Sports FC 24&quot; being the first installment under the new name.

Football video games such as &quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot;, &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;, &quot;Kick Off&quot; and &quot;Match Day&quot; had been developed since the late 1980s, and were already competitive in the games market when EA Sports announced a football game as the next addition to their EA Sports label. When the series began with &quot;FIFA International Soccer&quot; on the Sega Mega Drive in late 1993, it was notable for being the first to have an official license from FIFA, the world governing body of football. The main series has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA European Football Championship, as well as a series of football management titles. Since the 1990s, the franchise&#x27;s main competitor has been Konami&#x27;s &quot;eFootball&quot; series (formerly known as Pro Evolution Soccer, or PES).

The last release featured Kylian Mbappé, who appeared on the front cover of the series for the three consecutive years between &quot;FIFA 21&quot; and &quot;FIFA 23&quot;, as the face of the franchise. Chelsea Women forward Sam Kerr appears alongside Mbappé on the ultimate edition, becoming the first female footballer in franchise history to do so. In &quot;EA Sports FC 24&quot;, the inaugural installment of the succeeding &quot;EA Sports FC&quot; franchise, Erling Haaland appeared on the covers of both the standard and ultimate editions. Previous cover stars include Eden Hazard, who was the face of &quot;FIFA 20&quot;, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo, the cover star of &quot;FIFA 18&quot; and &quot;FIFA 19&quot;. Lionel Messi appeared on four straight covers from &quot;FIFA 13&quot; to &quot;FIFA 16&quot;. Wayne Rooney starred on seven covers of the series: every game from &quot;FIFA 06&quot; to &quot;FIFA 12&quot;. Ronaldinho appeared alongside Rooney on four of these (&quot;FIFA 06&quot; to &quot;FIFA 09&quot;), and he also appeared on the cover of &quot;FIFA Football 2004&quot;, &quot;FIFA Street&quot; and &quot;FIFA Street 3&quot;. Since the release of &quot;FIFA Mobile&quot; in 2016, midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and forwards Marco Reus (who also appeared on the cover of &quot;FIFA 17&quot;), Hazard, Ronaldo, Neymar, Paulo Dybala, Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior have appeared on the cover.

&quot;FIFA 12&quot; holds the record for the &quot;fastest selling sports game ever&quot; with over 3.2 million games sold and over $186 million generated at retail in its first week of release. The franchise&#x27;s final release, &quot;FIFA 23&quot;, was released worldwide on 27 September 2022. It is available for multiple gaming systems, including the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and Stadia.

==History==

While &quot;FIFA 95&quot; did not add much other than the ability to play with club teams, &quot;FIFA 96&quot; pushed the boundaries. For the first time with real player names by obtaining the FIFPro license, the PlayStation, PC, 32X and Sega Saturn versions used EA&#x27;s &quot;Virtual Stadium&quot; engine, with 2D sprite players moving around a real-time 3D stadium. &quot;FIFA 97&quot; improved on this with polygonal models for players and added an indoor soccer mode, but an early pinnacle was reached with &quot;FIFA: Road to World Cup 98&quot;. This version featured much improved graphics, a complete World Cup with qualifying rounds (including all national teams) and refined gameplay. Months later, &quot;World Cup 98&quot; was EA&#x27;s first officially licensed tournament game.

John Motson was the first commentator for the &quot;FIFA&quot; series, and has worked alongside Ally McCoist, Andy Gray, Des Lynam, Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle. Motson first joined the franchise for &quot;FIFA 96&quot;; he and McCoist were replaced by Gray and Clive Tyldesley for &quot;FIFA 06&quot; but later returned for &quot;FIFA Manager 08&quot;. Martin Tyler was the default commentator for the &quot;FIFA&quot; series from 2006 to 2020, alongside Andy Gray between 2006 and 2010 and Alan Smith from 2011 to 2020. Derek Rae and Lee Dixon appear in &quot;FIFA 19&quot; as commentators for UEFA competitions, and alternate with Tyler and Smith in all competitions in &quot;FIFA 20&quot;. Rae and Dixon became the sole English-language commentators in &quot;FIFA 21,&quot; replacing Tyler and Smith. In &quot;FIFA 22&quot; and &quot;FIFA 23&quot;, Stewart Robson serves as Derek Rae&#x27;s co-commentator, replacing Dixon. Guy Mowbray and Sue Smith were introduced as a new commentary duo in &quot;EA Sports FC 24&quot;, alternating with Derek Rae and Stewart Robson.
&quot;FIFA&quot; games have been met with some minor criticism; such as improvements each game features over its predecessor. As the console market expanded, &quot;FIFA&quot; was challenged directly by other titles, most notably Konami&#x27;s &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; (&quot;PES&quot;) series. The rivalry between both franchises since the 1990s has been considered the &quot;greatest rivalry&quot; in the history of sports video games. While &quot;FIFA&quot; initially had a more &quot;arcade-style&quot; approach, &quot;PES&quot; was more of a football simulation video game series with &quot;faster-paced tactical play&quot; and more varied emergent gameplay, which led to &quot;PES&quot; rivaling &quot;FIFA&quot; in sales during the 2000s. EA responded by borrowing gameplay elements from &quot;PES&quot; in order to improve &quot;FIFA&quot;, which led to &quot;FIFA&quot; pulling ahead commercially by a significant margin in the early 2010s. Both &quot;FIFA&quot; and &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; have a large following, but &quot;FIFA&quot; sales were rising by as much as 23 percent year-on-year in the early 2010s.

By 2000, the &quot;FIFA&quot; series had sold more than units worldwide, making it the best-selling association football video game series. In 2010, the &quot;FIFA&quot; series had sold over 100 million copies, making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world and the most profitable EA Sports title. With &quot;FIFA 12&quot; selling 3.2 million copies in the first week after its 27 September North American debut in 2011, EA Sports dubbed it &quot;the most successful launch in EA Sports history&quot;.

In 2012, EA Sports signed Lionel Messi to the &quot;FIFA&quot; franchise, luring him away from the competitor &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot;. Messi&#x27;s likeness was then immediately placed on the cover of &quot;FIFA Street&quot;. In 2013, the Spanish professional women&#x27;s footballer Vero Boquete started a petition on Change.org, which called upon Electronic Arts to introduce female players in the &quot;FIFA&quot; series. The petition attracted 20,000 signatures in 24 hours. &quot;FIFA 16&quot;, released on 25 September 2015, included female national teams.

In 2018, Steve Boxer of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;FIFA 18&quot; &quot;the slickest, most polished and by far the most popular football game around&quot; and &quot;football [video] games&#x27; equivalent of the Premier League&quot;. He praised the game&#x27;s FIFA Ultimate Team, which &quot;encourages you to purchase Panini-sticker-like player packs to build up a dream team&quot;, adding the series has &quot;an excellent Journey mode that lets you control an aspiring pro and build him up to an international superstar, and a Career mode that lets you control your favourite team on and off the field.&quot; The sixth best-selling video game franchise, by 2021, the &quot;FIFA&quot; series had sold over 325 million copies.

The latest installments in the series contain many exclusively licensed leagues including leagues and teams from around the world, including the German Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, English Premier League and EFL Championship, Italian Serie A and Serie B, Spanish La Liga and La Liga 2, French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, Portuguese Primeira Liga, Turkish Süper Lig, Dutch Eredivisie, Scottish Premiership, the Swiss Super League, Russian Premier League, Polish Ekstraklasa, Mexican Liga MX, American Major League Soccer, South Korean K-League, Japanese J1 League, the Chinese Super League, Saudi Professional League, Australian A-League, Chilean Primera División, Brazilian Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Argentine Liga Profesional de Fútbol, allowing the use of real leagues, clubs and player names and likenesses within the games. Popular clubs from around the world, including some teams from Greece, the Indian Super League, Ukraine and South Africa, are also included, without those nations&#x27; entire leagues. They are available in the &quot;Rest of World&quot; section.

==Games in the series==

===1990s===

====&quot;FIFA International Soccer&quot;====
*Cover athlete: David Platt and Piotr Świerczewski (Packie Bonner and Ruud Gullit in some versions)
*Released for: Mega Drive/Genesis, PC, DOS, Amiga, Sega CD (as &quot;FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition&quot;), 3DO, SNES, Master System, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy
*Release dates: 15 December 1993 (Mega Drive), 1994 (ports)

Known as &quot;EA Soccer&quot; during development and sometimes subsequently also known as &quot;FIFA &#x27;94&quot;, the first game in the series was released for the Sega Mega Drive in the weeks leading up to Christmas 1993. This greatly hyped football title broke with traditional 16-bit era games by presenting an isometric view rather than the more usual top-down view (&quot;Kick Off&quot;), side view (&quot;European Club Soccer&quot;), or bird&#x27;s eye view (&quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot; and &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;). It only includes national teams, and real player names are not used. A notorious bug allows the player to score by standing in front of the goalkeeper so that the ball rebounds off him into the net. The game was number one in the UK charts, replacing &quot;Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition&quot;, and staying there for a full six months. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #11 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time. The Sega Mega CD version was released under the title &quot;FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition&quot; it includes some features used in the next title, and is a highly polished version of the original. This version was ranked No. 7 on the &quot;Mega&quot; list of the &quot;Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time&quot;. The game on the 3DO console sported pseudo-3D cameras and it was the most graphically advanced version. The game is also playable on the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;FIFA 06&quot;. It was made in celebration for the 1994 FIFA World Cup held in the United States – especially noticeable in the Super NES version which, despite having a smaller team selection than the Genesis version, had three exclusive teams which qualified for the real-life tournament: Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The game was called &quot;International Soccer&quot; so EA could sell the game successfully in Europe, after assuming Americans would have no interest in the game.

====&quot;FIFA 95&quot;====

*Cover athlete: Erik Thorstvedt (Alexi Lalas in some versions)
*Released for: Mega Drive/Genesis
*Release date: 10 November 1994

Using the same engine with only minor touch-ups, &quot;FIFA 95&quot; introduced club teams to the series within eight national leagues: Brazil, Germany&#x27;s Bundesliga, Italy&#x27;s Serie A, Spain&#x27;s La Liga, England&#x27;s Premier League, France&#x27;s Ligue 1, Netherlands&#x27; Eredivisie and the United States. Most of the leagues have team lineups based on the 1993–94 season, and the teams, although recognisably real, all still have generic players, many of them even returning from the previous game. The USA League consists of teams and players from the A-League, the country&#x27;s second division – subsequent editions would feature &quot;artificial&quot; division one leagues, a feature not corrected until the 2000 edition, when Major League Soccer was included for the first time. In addition, the Brazilian league contained only teams from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states, with the exception of Internacional, from Rio Grande do Sul—it would not be until &quot;FIFA 07&quot; that Campeonato Brasileiro represented the country. The game eliminates the one-touch passing seen in the original &quot;FIFA International Soccer&quot;. This was also the only game in the main series not to be released in more than one platform (counting spin-offs, only &quot;FIFA 64&quot; and certain versions of the &quot;FIFA Manager&quot; series share this distinction).

====&quot;FIFA 96&quot;====

*Cover athlete: Ioan Ovidiu Sabau and Jason McAteer (European version)
*Released for: DOS/Windows, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Sega 32X, SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy
*Release date: 30 September 1995

This is the first &quot;FIFA&quot; game to feature real-time 3D graphics on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and PC versions, using technology called &quot;Virtual Stadium&quot;. It is also the first in the series to present players with real player names and positions, with ranking, transfer and team customisation tools. However, the Brazilian teams had mostly inaccurate rosters, some of them even featuring long-retired players (this would only be corrected in &quot;FIFA 99&quot;), and the American league consisted of entirely fictitious teams and rosters (Major League Soccer had been inaugurated for only a few months as of the game&#x27;s release, but it would only start to appear in the games as of &quot;FIFA 2000&quot;). The SNES and Mega Drive versions use an updated version of &quot;FIFA 95&quot;&#x27;s engine with new teams and graphics. It is also the first FIFA game to contain a player/team editor (in the Mega Drive and fifth-generation versions only). Also, in addition to the eight national leagues of the previous game, three leagues debuted in the game: Scottish Football League Premier Division, Allsvenskan and Super League Malaysia, a lineup that would stay for the next two editions as well. This was also the first &quot;FIFA&quot; game to have a proper introduction.

====&quot;FIFA 97&quot;====

*Cover athlete: David Ginola (European version); Bebeto (rest of the world)
*Released for: DOS/Windows, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Game Boy
*Release date: 30 November 1996

The biggest change in &quot;FIFA &#x27;97&quot; was the inclusion of 6-a-side indoor soccer mode and polygonal players, with motion capture provided by David Ginola. The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia. These versions also feature commentary by John Motson, partnered by Andy Gray, with Des Lynam introducing the matches.

====&quot;FIFA: Road to World Cup 98&quot;====

*Cover athlete: Roy Lassiter (USA); David Beckham (UK); Paolo Maldini (Italy); David Ginola (France); Andreas Möller (Germany); Raúl (Spain)
*Title song: &quot;Song 2&quot; by Blur
*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Game Boy
*Release date: 8 November 1997

This game marks the start of an upward trend in the series. It boasts a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadia, improved artificial intelligence, a &quot;Road to World Cup&quot; mode with all FIFA-registered national teams, and a licensed soundtrack featuring popular musical artists of the time. The game features many accurate team squads for national call up when playing in the round robin qualification modes. Another new feature was the ability to manually change the referee&#x27;s strictness, allowing some fouls to go un-noticed or without punishment.

Additionally, for the first time in a FIFA game, the offside rule is properly implemented. In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards. The 32-bit version of &quot;FIFA 98&quot; corrects this so that the game would only award a free kick for offside if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was.

&quot;FIFA 98&quot; was also the first of the series to feature a licensed soundtrack, with &quot;Song 2&quot; by Blur used as the intro track for the game. It was the last &quot;FIFA&quot; game to be released on the 16-bit consoles that the series had originated on.

====&quot;FIFA 99&quot;====

*Cover athlete: Dennis Bergkamp (World), Kasey Keller (USA), Fabien Barthez (France), Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan); Olaf Thon (Germany); Rui Costa (Portugal); Christian Vieri (Italy); Ahn Jung-hwan (South Korea); Fernando Morientes (Spain); Jason Kreis (USA beta)
*Title song: &quot;The Rockafeller Skank (Remix)&quot; by Fatboy Slim
*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64
*Release date: 30 November 1998. No description.

====&quot;FIFA 2000&quot;====

*Title song: &quot;It&#x27;s Only Us&quot; by Robbie Williams
*Cover athlete: Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan); Sol Campbell (UK); Vincenzo Montella (Italy); Pep Guardiola (Spain); Emmanuel Petit (France); Jaap Stam (Netherlands); Vassilios Tsiartas (Greece); Mehmet Scholl (Germany); Simão (Portugal); Eddie Pope (US); Raí (Brazil); Pär Zetterberg (Sweden); Đovani Roso (Israel); Kim Byung-ji (South Korea); Kiatisuk Senamuang (Thailand);
*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Game Boy Color
*Release date: 26 October 1999

This version of the FIFA series contained over 40 &quot;classic&quot; teams, so that gamers could play as retired football legends.

It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer, replacing the fictitious &quot;American&quot; league previously included, as well as national leagues from Denmark, Greece, Israel, Norway and Turkey (though Galatasaray is not present in the game), albeit removing the Portuguese Liga.

The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more &quot;emotion&quot; to the 3D player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.

The opening video for &quot;FIFA 2000&quot; features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1904, the year of the inauguration of FIFA. The game also included Port Vale, the club supported by Williams, in the &quot;Rest of the World&quot; section (they were in the Football League First Division at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with &quot;FIFA 2004&quot;).

===2000s===

====&quot;FIFA Football 2001&quot;====

*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation
*Release date: 8 November 2000

This title had a new graphics engine from FIFA Soccer World Championship which allows each team to have its own detailed kit, and for some players, their own unique faces. Doing away with ordinary coloured pennants as club emblems, the license includes official club emblems for the first time, although certain leagues, like the Dutch league, are unlicensed. Slightly tweakable physics made the game a modding favorite for its fan community. The game also includes the entire Austrian Bundesliga and Korean K-League as playable leagues for the first time, albeit removing the Turkish Premier League. A &quot;hack&quot; feature is included, where the player can press R1 to attempt an intentional foul, such a high sliding tackle. This title was the first game of the series with a power bar for shooting (such a feature already existed in the Super NES version of the first game, but it was not in all versions of the game). FIFA 2001 was the first version (for the PC) that could be played online, which was revolutionary, and the first game in the franchise on a 6th generation video game console in USA and Europe.

The PlayStation version of &quot;FIFA 2001&quot; received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, GameCube, PlayStation
*Release date: 1 November 2001

For &quot;FIFA Football 2002&quot;, power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer&#x27;s preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the &quot;Rest of World&quot; header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies. Playing with other national teams will allow the player to play through their respective zones&#x27; qualifying rounds (except for Oceania and Africa, whose confederations are not represented in full).

&quot;FIFA Football 2002&quot; was the final game in the main series to feature the Japanese national team, as the Japan Football Association would sell its exclusive rights to Konami during 2002, thereby depriving not only &quot;FIFA&quot;, but all other football games in the market (with the exception of EA&#x27;s World Cup spin-offs), from using its lineup and likeness (Japanese players in foreign markets continued to be featured in the series, though) until &quot;FIFA 17&quot;.

*Title song: &quot;To Get Down (Fatboy Slim remix)&quot; by Timo Maas
*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, Mobile phone
*Release date: 5 November 2002

&quot;FIFA Football 2003&quot; added features completely new gameplay from the previous titles. EA revamped the outdated DirectX 7 graphics used in &quot;FIFA 2001&quot; and &quot;2002&quot;, and introduced new graphics featuring more detailed stadia, players, and kits. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe&#x27;s top clubs in their own stadia and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport&#x27;s &quot;Freestyle Control&quot; which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to teammates. Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses. An Xbox version was added to the Windows and PlayStation 2, whereas the original PlayStation version was dropped.
FIFA Football 2003 was also the first game in the series to use the EA Trax.
EA Trax is the exclusive music menu system that has been used ever since in all FIFA titles.

====&quot;FIFA Football 2004&quot;====

*Cover athlete: Thierry Henry, Alessandro Del Piero and Ronaldinho
*Title song: &quot;Red Morning Light&quot; by Kings of Leon
*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, Nokia N-Gage, Mobile phone
*Release date: 18 October 2003

While not adding much to the game engine, the biggest new inclusion in &quot;FIFA Football 2004&quot; is secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams into the top leagues and competitions (a promotion/relegation system was present since the 2000 edition, but none up until this one featured second-tier leagues). A new gameplay feature dubbed &quot;off the ball&quot; was introduced, which is the ability to simultaneously control two players, in order, for example, to move a second player into the box in anticipation of a pass. The online mode was touted as the main feature. Another key feature is &quot;Football Fusion&quot;, which allows owners of both &quot;FIFA 2004&quot; and &quot;Total Club Manager 2004&quot; to play games from &quot;TCM&quot; in &quot;FIFA 2004&quot;. This is also the first &quot;FIFA&quot; game to feature Latin American club teams aside from those of the Brazilian League; there are four from Mexico (América, Toluca, Monterrey and UNAM; a fifth team, Tigres UANL, is present only in the Game Boy Advance version) and two from Argentina (Boca Juniors and River Plate). The title sequence, featuring Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry and Alessandro Del Piero, was filmed at St James&#x27; Park, the home ground of Newcastle United.

*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, PlayStation Portable (America only), Game Boy Advance, Nokia N-Gage, Gizmondo, Mobile phone
*Release date: 11 October 2004

&quot;FIFA Football 2005&quot; was released much earlier than the usual late October date to obtain a head start over &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot; and avoid clashing with EA Sports&#x27; own &quot;FIFA Street&quot;. The game features the return of the create-a-player mode, as well as an improved Career mode. The biggest difference compared to previous titles in the series is the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provides gamers with the ability to perform real-life tricks and passes. It is also the first version to feature the full Mexican League. The game has no opening video, but its soundtrack is headlined by British DJ Paul Oakenfold, who composed the &quot;FIFA Theme&quot; especially for the game, using some sounds from the game such as artificial crowd noise and commentary. This was the last title released for the original PlayStation in the US. The game also features authentic crowd chants edited by producer Dan Motut.

====&quot;FIFA 06&quot;====

*Cover athlete: Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho (in North America, Omar Bravo and Freddy Adu joined Ronaldinho on the cover)
*Released for: GameCube, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360
*Release date: 4 October 2005

&quot;FIFA&quot;&#x27;s developers made a complete overhaul of the game engine for this installment of &quot;FIFA&quot;, claiming a dramatic increase in the control of play, having rewritten more than half the game&#x27;s code. In addition to a renovation of the engine, which discards the &quot;off the ball&quot; system, the developers boasted a significantly more involved Career mode and the introduction of &quot;team chemistry&quot; which determines how well team members play together. This installment breaks with the long tradition of commentary from &quot;Match of the Day&quot;&#x27;s John Motson and (more recently) Ally McCoist, who are replaced by ITV&#x27;s Clive Tyldesley and former Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray, who had already worked in the series as guest commentator.

One of the new features in &quot;FIFA 06&quot; was a special &quot;retro&quot; which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it includes an unlockable classic biographies section, a memorable moments video compilation, which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the &quot;FIFA 06&quot; developers, a video compilation with a retrospective view of every game in the FIFA series and the chance to play the first ever game in the &quot;FIFA&quot; series which was titled as &quot;FIFA 94&quot;. The game also features for the first time a Classic XI team consisting of great football legends and a World XI team consisting of current great superstars. Both teams have the Cardiff Millennium Stadium as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the &quot;Fan Shop&quot;.

The Xbox 360 version, titled &quot;FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup&quot;, featured only national teams and a brand-new engine taking advantage of the Xbox 360&#x27;s graphical capabilities. It was the first FIFA game on a seventh-generation console.

*Released for: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, Java ME
*Release date: 25 September 2006

The main differences from the previous game are a new &quot;Interactive Leagues&quot; function, new stadia such as the new Wembley Stadium and Emirates Stadium, and the ability to create custom teams and Süper Lig returns after seven years of absence from the series. The game&#x27;s front-end and graphics engine remain largely the same. The Xbox 360 version, now a full-fledged conversion of the game, uses a completely new game engine which was created from scratch for the system. This Xbox 360 version also features a much reduced team line-up, completely removing all lower division teams and focusing on the four main European leagues, plus the Mexican Clausura and national teams. This was the last title released for the GameCube, Xbox and Game Boy Advance.

*Release date: 27 September 2007
&quot;FIFA 08&quot; introduced a new game mode called &quot;Be a Pro&quot;, in which the player controls only a single player on the field. This version also introduced a larger club section including the League of Ireland, and the Hyundai A-League of Australia, for the first time. Unlike &quot;FIFA 06&quot; and &quot;07&quot; however, &quot;FIFA 08&quot; does not include any memorable moments or season highlights.
This edition introduced the Practice Arena Feature that allowed training and improving the dribbling, shooting, or practicing free kicks and penalties while on the practice pitch.

It was the first game in the franchise for PlayStation 3 and Wii, the latter introducing motion controls for shooting, as well as three mini-games that make use of the Wii Remote.

*Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Java ME, Zeebo
*Release date: 3 October 2008

&quot;FIFA 09&quot; features a revamped collision system and an option for 10 versus 10 &quot;Be a Pro&quot; online matches, and the new &quot;Adidas Live Season&quot; feature, which updates all the players&#x27; stats in a particular league based on the player&#x27;s form in real life. Although the feature is activated through microtransactions, gamers have access to one free league of their choice from the moment they activate the service to the end of the 2008–09 season. Online play has also been improved in &quot;FIFA 09&quot;, with a feature called &quot;FIFA 09 Clubs&quot; allowing players to form or join clubs and field their strongest team online. The game is the first in the &quot;FIFA&quot; series to feature user-controlled goal celebrations. &quot;FIFA 09&quot; has met with generally positive reception from reviewers.

Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray again provide the commentary in the English version. However, in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, Tyldesley is replaced by Martin Tyler. For the first time, users can also purchase extra commentator voices in different languages from the PlayStation Store (PlayStation 3) and Xbox Live Marketplace (Xbox 360). Another option for the English language is Tyldesley and Andy Townsend.

&quot;FIFA 10&quot; has an extended Manager Mode which includes a new Assistant Manager that can be used to take care of the team&#x27;s line-up and to rotate the squad based on importance of the upcoming match and improved finances. The &quot;Player Experience and Growth System&quot; has changed. Player growth will now be determined by in-game performance, demands placed on the player, and achievements based on the player&#x27;s particular position. The games also features 50 stadia and 31 leagues, among which the Russian Premier League is introduced to the series (except for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions). It also includes 360 degrees player control instead of the 8-direction control in previous games.

Other new features include an improved passing system, improved player likenesses, the ability to play as a Goalkeeper for the first time, and other various other tweaks and additions.
The English commentary is provided for the fourth time by Martin Tyler and Andy Gray. Landon Donovan, Kaká and Carlos Vela feature on the cover of the North American version of the game, while Kaká and Wayne Rooney feature on the cover of the UK and Irish version. Aside from Kaká and Rooney, Petr Čech and Andrés Iniesta are also prominently featured in the game, appearing in in-game screens like the menus of the PC version.

David Rutter, the line producer for &quot;FIFA 12&quot;, has promised &quot;a revolutionary year for &quot;FIFA&quot;... especially in the gameplay department.&quot; The first screenshot was revealed on 11 April, featuring Brazilian midfielder Kaká running through the field.

&quot;FIFA 12&quot; is the first edition of the series to feature Arabic commentary. The Czech First League and Turkish Süper Lig are removed from the game (though Turkish side Galatasaray is still featured) and a third Argentine team, Racing Club de Avellaneda, is added to the Rest of World bracket. The Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 were the main consoles for the game, and for the first time, the PC version was feature-identical. In May, EA announced that a Nintendo 3DS version would be available, including career mode, 11 vs 11, street mode and Be a Pro, but excluding any online mode. On 27 May, it was confirmed that &quot;FIFA 12&quot; would be released on PlayStation 2. On 7 June, it was confirmed that the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch will also be included and others are to come in the next few months. On 11 July, photos of the Career Mode were released. During the demo launch on 13 September 2011, both &quot;FIFA 12&quot; and Xbox Live were trending on social networking site Twitter.
For the first time in the series, the game has been officially ported to the Mac OS X operating system by TransGaming. In March 2012, &quot;FIFA Football&quot; was released as a launch title for the PS Vita, which despite the different name was a port of &quot;FIFA 12&quot;.

New features include:
*Player Impact Engine – a physics engine built to deliver real-world physicality in every interaction on the pitch
*Precision Dribbling – delivers a higher fidelity of touch on the ball for attacking players
*Tactical Defending – places equal importance on positioning, intercepting passes and tackling
*Pro Player Intelligence (only for CPU players)

On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the game is the first of the series compatible with Kinect and PlayStation Move, respectively. The game also features the Saudi Professional League, the first time Arabic football is represented in the series (while &quot;FIFA 2000&quot; did include club teams from the Arab world, it was generic teams with non-distinctive uniforms). It is the only &quot;FIFA&quot; title to be released on the Wii U.

New features include:
*Attacking Intelligence – Players automatically analyse space and think ahead making it potentially easier to break down the defence, with Goalkeeping Intelligence also improved in similar ways.
*Complete Dribbling – Precise 360-degree mobility with the ball allowing players to be more dangerous and creative during 1-on-1 confrontations.
*1st Touch Control – Eliminates near-perfect touches for all players, allowing defenders to take advantage of the loss of focus and poor touches to win back possession.
*EA SPORTS Football Club – Earn rewards, level up, enjoy live challenges and play with friends. Rewards and items can be unlocked from EA SPORTS Catalogue and climb up to 100 levels. Support Your Club in every area of the game and play through the real-world season. The new app allows fans to connect to Ultimate Team and EA SPORTS Football Club on the game.

For the newest generation of video game consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game showcases a new engine, Ignite, which allows not only for graphical enhancements, like shifting weather conditions and dynamic environment, but also for changes in gameplay, with features like Human Intelligence (which brings the AI closer to real player behavior) and True Player Motion (which gives the players more realistic animations). Also, all versions have an all-new Co-op Seasons online mode, in which two players can play a season for the same team. As for the team selection, the game features, for the first time, the top leagues from Argentina, Chile and Colombia, the first time South American leagues other than the Brazilian one are featured in a FIFA game.
The PC version does not feature the Ignite engine (which will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One releases); rather than that, they will feature the Impact engine, same as used in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions (which the PC versions have been using since &quot;11&quot;), with minor improvements. This is reportedly due to Electronic Arts&#x27; claims that most PC players do not own a machine powerful enough for the Ignite engine, therefore it would only be featured in the next edition. This is the last FIFA game to be released for the PlayStation Portable and FIFA 14 would eventually become the last PlayStation 2 game produced and released in South America. The game features new signature goal celebrations from a number of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Lionel Messi, among others.

This is the last title for the Wii and handhelds. The Windows version used the new engine (Ignite Engine) for the first time, which is the same as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The first edition released during EA&#x27;s deal with the English Premier League as Official Sports Technology Partner. This deal allows all 20 Premier League stadiums to be included in the game as well as official Premier League scoreboards and television graphics. FIFA&#x27;s exclusive access to Premier League clubs allowed detailed photography of all 20 stadiums so they could be authentically recreated, with the cheers, chants and sounds of more than 20 Premier League matches also recorded. Since this game any club promoted to the Premier League has had their stadium added. Due to licensing troubles with Brazilian players, this was the first game in the main series that did not feature a Brazilian league in any form. &quot;FIFA 15&quot; also brought back the Turkish Süper Lig to the series after it was initially removed with the release of &quot;FIFA 12&quot;.

&quot;FIFA 16&quot; was the first title in the series to include female athletes and national teams. After the complications in the previous edition, some Brazilian teams - except for those which had exclusivity deals with Konami&#x27;s rival &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; series - agreed to lend their visual identities (badges, names and kits) to the game, but no such agreement was reached with players due to the decentralization of player image rights in Brazil; as a result, the Brazilian teams are placed in the Rest of World block (being given their own incomplete league slot in subsequent editions), with their rosters comprised completely by fictional players (although real players were featured until the March 2016 updates), unlike all other clubs and most national teams.

The game also features the third tier of German football, 3. Liga, the Iceland and Saudi Arabia national football teams, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national New Zealand teams and has the Turkish Super League after EA renewed its licence with them. EA Sports introduced Quick Subs into &quot;FIFA 18&quot; where the player can make a substitute when the ball goes out of play. The Cruyff turn – a feint named after 1970s Dutch star Johan Cruyff – is one of the four new skills added to the game. A post-launch update for the Xbox One, PS4, PC and Switch versions added the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with the inclusion of &quot;World Cup Ultimate Team&quot; to the &quot;FIFA&quot; series, in which it&#x27;s a separate mode from the main &quot;Ultimate Team&quot; mode.

A new feature in &quot;FIFA 20&quot; titled &quot;Volta Football&quot; brings back previous &quot;FIFA Street&quot;-style elements, providing a variance on the traditional Pro Clubs gameplay. It will include the ability to play 3v3 Rush (no goalkeepers), 4v4, 4v4 Rush, 5v5 and professional futsal modes. The game places an emphasis on skill and independent play, rather than tactical or team-play. The player is also able to customise their own player; aside from selecting gender, the players will also have a variety of clothes and accessories to choose from, ranging from shoes and clothes to hats and tattoos. The Pro Clubs mode has also changed, with more 1-on-1s encouraged, more off-the-ball space creation, as well as new penalty and free-kick mechanics. Juventus were not in &quot;FIFA 20&quot; as they signed a partnership deal with &quot;PES 2020&quot;; they were called Piemonte Calcio in &quot;FIFA 20&quot;. Liverpool announced a &quot;long-term&quot; partnership with &quot;FIFA&quot;. Since the start of the 2020 season, EA Sports signed the deal with CONMEBOL to become the latest exclusive partner of the CONMEBOL club competitions which include the CONMEBOL Libertadores and Recopa as well as the second-tier CONMEBOL Sudamericana, available on the content update in March 2020.

This latest installment features playable women&#x27;s domestic leagues for very first time in the franchise history, such as the FA Women&#x27;s Super League in England, Frauen-Bundesliga in Germany, Division 1 Féminine in France and the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League in the U.S. Cross-play between Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC and Stadia players, as well as Xbox One and PS4 players, is supported at launch. It released on 30 September 2022.
The game features fictional club AFC Richmond from the Apple TV+ series &quot;Ted Lasso&quot;. On September 22, 2023, EA Sports launched EA Sports FC, serving as the direct successor to their former FIFA series.

== Discontinuation ==

As EA Sports and FIFA had failed to reach an agreement over licensing fees for the use of the FIFA name, &quot;FIFA 23&quot; became the last installment of the game developed by EA Sports under the name. EA Sports continued to release football games under the title &quot;EA Sports FC&quot; beginning in 2023, while FIFA has stated an intention to enter a partnership with a new developer to produce &quot;the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name&quot; in 2024. FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated, &quot;I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans.&quot; He added that &quot;the FIFA name is the only global, original title. FIFA 23, FIFA 24, FIFA 25 and FIFA 26, and so on – the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain the best.&quot; In October 2024, FIFA partnered with Konami to host two FIFAe World Cup editions in Konami&#x27;s eFootball. EA Sports FC 24 featured exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A, and MLS.

==Other titles==
;&quot;FIFA Soccer 64&quot;
:The first &quot;FIFA&quot; game on the Nintendo 64 console, released in early 1997. It is similar to the 32-bit versions of &quot;FIFA 97&quot;, and was initially announced under the same title. High numbers of pre-orders for &quot;FIFA 64&quot; led Electronic Arts to reverse its recent decision to withdraw from Nintendo 64 software development, instead announcing plans to release several EA Sports games for the Nintendo 64 over the next year.
;&quot;FA Premier League Stars&quot; series
:Two games, in 2000 and 2001, FIFA was based primarily around the Premier League, though localised versions of the second game were released in Germany, France, Spain and South Korea.
;&quot;FIFA Soccer World Championship&quot; (&quot;FIFAサッカー ワールドチャンピオンシップ&quot;)
:Released only in Japan on 25 May 2000, this PlayStation 2 exclusive, a prototype of &quot;FIFA 2001&quot;, was the first installment of the series on a 6th generation video game console. The game contains under-23 national teams like Australia national under-23 soccer team, and Japan national under-23 football team, due to Japan U-23 having qualified to the quarter-finals at the Sydney Olympics, just like a Japanese version of &quot;ISS Pro Evolution 2,&quot; but it sold only in Japan by Electronic Arts Square.
;&quot;UEFA Champions League series&quot;
:Two games were released in the series: &quot;UEFA Champions League 2004–2005&quot; and &quot;UEFA Champions League 2006–2007&quot;.
;&quot;FIFA Total Football&quot; (&quot;FIFAトータルフットボール&quot;)
:Released in Japan in March 2004 on the PlayStation 2, it was based on &quot;FIFA 2004&quot;.
;&quot;FIFA Superstars&quot;
:This is a Facebook game developed for EA Sports by Playfish. The game operates on a similar premise to the &quot;Ultimate Team&quot; mode that appears in the main FIFA games. Users collect trading cards that represent different players; each card has a statistical rating of the player&#x27;s skills, contributing to an average team skill rating. The skill rating is augmented by a &quot;training&quot; rating, and the combination of the two ratings gives the overall team rating. These ratings determine the outcomes of matches played by the team; a team must win a certain number of matches to progress through a series of leagues, culminating with the &quot;Superstars&quot; league. Users may purchase new player cards with in-game &quot;coins&quot;, which are acquired through playing matches, winning leagues and as gifts from friends; the cards come in bronze, silver and gold packs, with bronze containing low-rated players and gold containing the best players in the game, although gold packs cost more coins. Coins may also be used to purchase training and stadium upgrades, such as training cones and seating. The game requires match credits, which can be earned by playfish cash, penalty shootouts, playing against your friends or simply waiting over time. The game was released in February 2010. The game has gone offline at the end of March 2013, with very lousy service and many user complaints on the forum.
;&quot;FIFA World&quot;
:A free-to-play massively multiplayer online &quot;FIFA&quot; game, this time distributed by EA Sports themselves. Based on &quot;FIFA 14&quot;, the game offers both match and FIFA Ultimate Team gameplay. Announced on 9 August 2013, an open beta was released on 12 November 2013 in Brazil and Russia, before being made globally available on 20 May 2014. The game went offline on 14 July 2015.

<doc id="649963" wikidata="Q233025" url="?curid=649963" title="Ticto barb">
<text>The ticto barb or twospot barb (Pethia ticto) is a species of subtropical freshwater fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is a native of the upper Mekong, Salwen, Irrawaddy, Meklong and upper Charo Phraya basins in the countries of Nepal, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. It has frequently been confused with the Odessa barb in the aquarium trade, but in that species the male is reddish-orange (lacking in &quot;P. ticto&quot;).

The ticto barb is silver and gold with two black spots; one just before the pectoral fin and one near the back tail. It grows to a maximum length of .

It is natively found in still, shallow, marginal waters of lakes and rivers, usually with muddy bottoms. It browses close to the substrate in shallow water. Ticto barbs natively live in a subtropical environment and prefer water with a 6.0—7.0 pH, a water hardness of up to 10 dGH, and a temperature range of . Their diet consists of small crustaceans, insects and plankton.

The ticto barb is one of many barbs undergoing revisions in their taxonomic classification. It is frequently confused with its sympatric relative &quot;P. stoliczkana&quot;.

==In the aquarium==

The ticto barb is an active schooling fish, which is usually kept in groups. When in large enough groups, they will not bother any other species of fish. They prefer a well planted environment that is similar to the still and shallow waters with mud bottoms of their native habitat.

Ticto barbs are egg-layers that spawn among a coarse gravel bed. During spawning, they will lay approximately 150 eggs, laying around 20 at a time. Once spawning is finished, they will usually eat any of the eggs that they find. It is usually necessary to separate the fish from the eggs after spawning in order to prevent the eggs from being eaten. The eggs will hatch in approximately 1 day and will be free-swimming a day later.

<text>Redhouse () is a townland in County Kilkenny, Ireland located midway between the towns of Callan and Kilmanagh.

Redhouse is noted in historical records as having a well which was used by thousands during the Great Irish Famine as many other wells in the area had gone dry. To this is attributed a higher than average survival rate in the area during the famine.

<text>A quilombo (); from the Kimbundu word , ) is a Brazilian hinterland settlement founded by people of African origin, and others sometimes called Carabali. Most of the inhabitants of quilombos, called quilombolas, were maroons, a term for escaped slaves.

Documentation about refugee slave communities typically uses the term mocambo for settlements, which is an Ambundu word meaning &quot;war camp&quot;. A mocambo is typically much smaller than a quilombo. &quot;Quilombo&quot; was not used until the 1670s, primarily in the more southerly parts of Brazil.

In the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America, such villages or camps were called . Its inhabitants are . They spoke various Spanish-African-based creole languages such as Palenquero.

Quilombos are classified as one of the three basic forms of active resistance by enslaved Africans. They also regularly attempted to seize power and conducted armed insurrections at plantations to gain amelioration of conditions. Typically, quilombos were a &quot;pre-19th century phenomenon&quot;. In the first half of the 19th century in Brazil, enslaved people typically took armed action as part of their resistance. The colony was undergoing both political transition, as it fought for independence from Portugal, and new tensions associated with an increased slave trade, which brought in many more native-born Africans who resisted slavery.

== Origin ==

In 17th-century Angola, a new military formation called &quot;kilombo&quot; (a fortified town surrounded by a wooden palisade) appeared among Imbangala warriors, which would soon be used in Brazil by freed Angolan slaves.

== Slavery in Brazil ==
Legal slavery was present in Brazil for approximately three centuries, with the earliest known landing of enslaved Africans taking place 52 years after the Portuguese were the first Europeans to set foot in Brazil in 1500. The demand for enslaved Africans continued to increase through the 18th century, even as the Brazilian sugar economy ceased to dominate the world economy. In its place, commodity crops such as tobacco increased in prominence.

During the sugar boom period (1570–1670), the sugar plantations in Brazil presented hellish conditions, including the personal brutality of enslavers and the whip-wielding overseers in their employ. Physical torture was common for minor infractions. There was high physical exertion on workers, especially during harvest season. In addition, enslaved people were held to nearly-impossible daily production quotas while having to contend with lack of rest and food. Economically, in sugar plantations, it was cheaper for owners of enslaved Africans to work them to death and get new replacement enslaved people. Conditions were so bad that even the Crown intervened on at least two occasions, forcing plantation owners to provide the people they enslaved with sufficient food.

== History ==
:&quot;See Atlantic slave trade for a comprehensive presentation of slavery in Brazil&quot;.

Settlements were formed by enslaved Africans who escaped from plantations. Some enslavers, such as Friedrich von Weech, regarded the first escape attempt as a part of the &quot;breaking in&quot; process for new slaves. The first escape attempt would be punished severely as a deterrent for future escapes. Enslaved people who tried to escape a second time would be sent to slave prisons, and those who tried a third time would be sold. In general, slaves who were caught running away were also required to wear an iron collar around their necks at all times, in addition to the punishment they received.

Not all those who escaped slavery formed settlements in Brazil. Escaping from a life of slavery was a matter of opportunity. Settlements were formed in areas with dense populations of formerly enslaved people, like Pernambuco, where the biggest collection of mocambos formed the quilombo that became Palmares. While many quilombos were formed in rural areas such as Palmares, some were formed inside of cities, such as the :pt:Quilombo do Leblon inside of Rio de Janeiro. Some, among them Mahommah G. Baquaqua, escaped to New York because his multiple attempts at escape and suicide led to him being sold to a ship&#x27;s captain.

It is widely believed that the term &quot;quilombo&quot; establishes a link between settlements and the culture of West Central Africa from where the majority of slaves were forcibly brought to Brazil. During the era of slave trafficking, natives in central Angola, called Imbangala, had created an institution called a &quot;kilombo&quot; that united various tribes of diverse lineage into a community designed for military resistance.

Many &quot;quilombos&quot; were near Portuguese plantations and settlements. To keep their freedom, they were active both in defending against &quot;capitães do mato&quot; and being commissioned to recapture other runaway slaves. At the same time, they facilitated the escape of even more enslaved persons. For this reason, they were targets of the Dutch, then Portuguese colonial authorities and, later, of the Brazilian state and enslavers.

Despite the atmosphere of cooperation between some &quot;quilombos&quot; and the surrounding Portuguese settlements, they were almost always eventually destroyed. Seven of 10 major &quot;quilombos&quot; in colonial Brazil were terminated within two years of formation. Some &quot;mocambos&quot; that were farther from Portuguese settlements and the later Brazilian cities were tolerated and still exist as towns today, with their dwellers speaking Portuguese Creole languages.

== Quilombos ==
Seven of the ten major quilombos in colonial Brazil were destroyed within two years of being formed. Four fell in Bahia in 1632, 1636, 1646 and 1796. The other three met the same fate in Rio in 1650, Parahyba in 1731, and Piumhy in 1758.

One quilombo, in Minas Gerais, lasted from 1712 to 1719. Another, the &quot;Carlota&quot; of Mato Grosso, was wiped out after existing for 25 years, from 1770 to 1795.

There were also a number of smaller quilombos or mocambos. The first reported quilombo was in 1575 in Bahia. Another quilombo in Bahia was reported at the start of the seventeenth century. Between 1737-87, a small quilombo thrived in the vicinity of Sao Paulo.

There were also reports of mocambos in 1591 in Jaguaripe, in 1629 in Rio Vermelho, in 1636 in Itapicuru, in 1640 in Rio Real, in 1663 in Cairu, in 1723 in Camamu, in 1741 in Santo Amaro, in 1763 in Itapao, and 1797 in Cachoeira. All of these mocambos were in the Bahia region.

The Buraco de Tatu mocambo thrived for 20 years between 1743 and 1763. It was located between Salvador and Itapoa until it was eventually destroyed by a force led by Joaquim da Costa Cardozo.

The region of Campo Grande and São Francisco was often populated with quilombos. In 1741, Jean Ferreira organised an expedition against a quilombo, but many runaways escaped capture. In 1746, a subsequent expedition captured 120 members of the quilombo. In 1752, an expedition led by Pere Marcos was attacked by quilimbo fighters, resulting in significant loss of life.

Quilombos continued to form in the nineteenth century. In 1810, a quilombo was discovered at Linhares in Sao Paulo. A decade later, another was found in Minas. In 1828, another quilombo was discovered at Cahuca, near Recife, and a year later, an expedition was mounted against another at Corcovado, near Rio. In 1855, the Maravilha quilombo in Amazonia was destroyed.

=== Palmares ===

The most famous quilombo was Palmares, an independent, self-sufficient community near Recife, established in about 1600. Palmares was massive and consisted of several settlements with a combined population of over 30,000 citizens, mostly blacks. It was to survive almost an entire century. 

Part of the reason for the massive size of the quilombo at Palmares was because of its location in Brazil, at the median point between the Atlantic Ocean and Guinea, an important area of the African slave trade&quot;. Quilombo dos Palmares&quot; was an autonomous community of escaped enslaved people from the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, &quot;a region perhaps the size of Portugal in the hinterland of Bahia&quot;.

In 1612, the Portuguese tried in vain to take Palmares in an expedition that proved to be very costly.

In 1640, a Dutch scouting mission found that the self-freed community of Palmares was spread over two settlements, with about 6,000 living in one location, and another 5,000 in another. Dutch expeditions against Palmares in the 1640s were similarly unsuccessful.

At its height, Palmares had a population of over 30,000. In the 1670s, when the Portuguese tried to take control of half of Palmares, it was estimated that the palmarista population of that half was between 15,000-20,000.

Palmares thrived in the years of peace that followed the 1640s.

Between 1672 and 1694, Palmares withstood, on average, one Portuguese expedition nearly every year.

Ganga Zumba and Zumbi are the two best-known warrior-leaders of Palmares which, after a history of conflict with first Dutch and then Portuguese colonial authorities, finally fell to a Portuguese artillery assault in 1694. 

Forced to defend against repeated attacks by Portuguese colonists, the warriors of Palmares were experts in capoeira, a dance and martial art form. Portuguese soldiers sometimes stated it took more than one dragoon to capture a quilombo warrior since they would defend themselves with a strangely moving fighting technique (capoeira). The governor from that province declared that &quot;it is harder to defeat a quilombo than the Dutch invaders&quot;.

In Brazil, both men are now honored as heroes and symbols of black pride, freedom, and democracy. As his birthday is unknown, Zumbi&#x27;s execution date, November 20, is observed as &quot;Dia da Consciência Negra&quot; or &quot;Black Awareness Day&quot; in the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and his image has appeared on postage stamps, banknotes, and coins.

=== Mola ===
The Mola quilombo comprised approximately 300 formerly enslaved people and had a high degree of political, social, and military organization. Felipa Maria Aranha was the first leader of the community. The group was also led by Maria Luiza Piriá. It was organised as a republic, with democratic voting in place. Over the course of the Mola quilombo&#x27;s life, it expanded to include four other similar settlements in the region; it was known as the Confederação do Itapocu&quot;.&quot; In 1895, there were still traces of the settlement to be seen; as of 2020, they had disappeared.

=== Curiaú ===
In 1992, the Rio Curiaú Environmental Protection Area was established for the inhabitants of Curiaú de Dentro, Curiaú de Fora, Casa Grande, Curralinho and Mocambo. The area is located near the capital Macapá and measures . As of 1999, the protected area is home to about 1,500 people.

=== Cunani ===
Even though Cunani is better known as the capital of the unrecognised Republic of Independent Guiana, it has been designated a Quilombo settlement, and therefore, has been given territory similar to the indigenous territories.

== Film ==

A 1984 film entitled &quot;Quilombo&quot; depicts the rise and fall of Palmares. Directed by Carlos Diegues, &quot;Quilombo&quot; is a historical epic that chronicles the lives of Ganga Zumba and Zumbi.

== Constitution of Brazil ==

Article 68 of the 1988 Constitution of Brazil granted the remaining quilombos the collective ownership of the lands they had occupied since colonial times. As of 2016, 294 villages have applied to be recognized as quilombos, because they were founded by escaped enslaved people and are mainly inhabited by their descendants. The certification process thus far has been slow, and 152 villages have been recognized as quilombos.

== In Spanish ==

In South American Spanish of the Southern Cone, the word &quot;quilombo&quot; has come to mean &quot;brothel&quot;; in Argentina, Bolivia, Honduras, Paraguay, and Uruguay, a mess, noise or disorder; in Venezuela, a remote or out-of-the-way place.

<doc id="649975" wikidata="Q2778054" url="?curid=649975" title="Anquan Boldin">
<text>Anquan Kenmile Boldin Sr. (; born October 3, 1980) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons. He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles and was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round of the 2003 NFL draft. He also played for the Baltimore Ravens, the San Francisco 49ers and the Detroit Lions.

Boldin was the 2003 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, was selected to three Pro Bowls and won Super Bowl XLVII with the Ravens. In 2015, he was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year for his community service. Despite not being named to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, Boldin is widely considered as one of the greatest wide receivers of his era.

==Early life==
Boldin played football, basketball, and ran track at Pahokee High School. His ability playing as a quarterback led him to be named Florida&#x27;s Mr. Football in 1998. During his senior season, Pahokee held a 10–0 regular season record including a 34–14 win over Glades Central in the annual Muck Bowl. After the season, he was a USA Today first-team selection and named &quot;Florida Player of the Year&quot;.

Also a standout track athlete, Boldin competed in sprinting, jumping and throwing events at Pahokee High. He was timed at 52.34 seconds over 400 meters. In jumps, he recorded a personal-best leap of 6.13 meters in the long jump. As a thrower, he got a top-throw of 13.53 meters in the shot put.

In 2007, he was named to the Florida High School Association All-Century Team, a team compiled of the top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state of Florida.

==College career==
Boldin attended Florida State University from 1999 to 2002. In the 2002 season, he had nine receptions for 175 receiving yards against Notre Dame, a three-touchdown game against North Carolina, and a two-touchdown game against rival Florida. He was converted to wide receiver in order to get more playing time. In 23 games at wide receiver, he caught 118 passes for 1,790 yards (averaging 15.2 yards per reception) and 21 touchdowns.

==Professional career==

===Pre-draft===
Boldin created initial concerns of the NFL scouts after he registered a relatively slow 4.7 time in the 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine.

===Arizona Cardinals===

====2003 season====
Boldin was drafted in the second round by the Arizona Cardinals with the 54th overall pick in the 2003 NFL draft.

Boldin set an NFL record for most receiving yards by a rookie in his first game with 217 on ten receptions against the Detroit Lions. In Week 10, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had eight receptions for 118 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 28–15 loss. Two weeks later, he had six receptions for 123 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 30–27 loss to the St. Louis Rams. In Week 14, against the San Francisco 49ers, he had nine receptions for 123 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 50–14 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. In Week 16 against the Seattle Seahawks, he had ten receptions for 122 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 28–10 loss.

As a rookie, he tied Billy Sims for most yards from scrimmage by a rookie in his first game (217), and holds the NFL record for most receptions in the first 26 games of an NFL career (157). He is also the fastest to record 300 career receptions (47 games) and finished the season with 101 catches, 1,377 receiving yards, and eight touchdowns. Boldin was the only rookie selected to the 2004 Pro Bowl. He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. He was named Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press and the PFWA. In addition, he was named Sporting News Rookie of the Year.
====2004 season====
Boldin suffered a right knee injury in training camp. He was inactive for the first six regular season games. In the 2004 season, Boldin finished with 56 receptions for 623 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in ten games. He had two games going over 100 receiving yards on the year.

====2005 season====
In Week 2, against the St. Louis Rams, Boldin had eight receptions for 119 receiving yards in the 17–12 loss. In Week 4, against San Francisco, he had eight receptions for 116 receiving yards and a touchdown in the 31–14 victory. In the following game, against the Carolina Panthers, he had ten receptions for 162 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown in the 24–20 loss. In Week 11, Boldin started a streak of five consecutive games going over the 100-yard mark. Arguably his finest moment came against the San Francisco 49ers on December 4 when he broke several tackles and scored the game-winning touchdown in a 17–10 win. He had 11 receptions for 156 receiving yards on the day. In Week 15 against the Houston Texans, he had eight receptions for 134 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 30–19 loss. In the 2005 season, despite missing time with an injury, Boldin still caught more than 100 passes for over 1,400 yards. He led the league in receiving yards per game with 100.1. That year, he and fellow wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald became only the third duo from the same team to each catch over 100 receptions and top the 1,400-yard mark. They joined Detroit&#x27;s Herman Moore and Brett Perriman, who accomplished the feat in 1995, and Denver Broncos tandem Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith, who did it in 2000.

====2006 season====
In Week 3, against the St. Louis Rams, Boldin had ten receptions for 129 receiving yards in the 16–14 loss. In Week 6, against the Chicago Bears, he had 12 receptions for 136 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 24–23 loss. In Week 12, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had nine receptions for 140 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 31–26 loss. After compiling 83 catches, 1,203 receiving yards and four touchdowns in 2006, Boldin was selected to play in his second Pro Bowl.

====2007 season====

<text>Yuan-Cheng &quot;Bert&quot; Fung (September 15, 1919 – December 15, 2019) was a Chinese-American bioengineer and writer. He is regarded as a founding figure of bioengineering, tissue engineering, and the &quot;Founder of Modern Biomechanics&quot;.

==Biography==

Fung was born in Jiangsu Province, China in 1919. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1941 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1943 from the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University in mainland China and reinstated in Taiwan), and earned a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1948. Fung was Professor Emeritus and Research Engineer at the University of California San Diego. He published prominent texts along with Pin Tong who was then at Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology. Fung died at Jacobs Medical Center in San Diego, California, aged 100, on December 15, 2019.

Fung was married to Luna Yu Hsien-Shih, a former mathematician and cofounder of the UC San Diego International Center, until her death in 2017. The couple raised two children.

==Research==
He is the author of numerous books including Foundations of Solid Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics, and a series of books on Biomechanics. He is also one of the principal founders of the &quot;Journal of Biomechanics&quot; and was a past chair of the ASME International Applied Mechanics Division. In 1972, Fung established the Biomechanics Symposium under the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This biannual summer meeting, first held at the Georgia Institute of Technology, became the annual Summer Bioengineering Conference. Fung and colleagues were also the first to recognize the importance of residual stress on arterial mechanical behavior.

===Fung&#x27;s Law===
Fung&#x27;s famous exponential strain constitutive equation for preconditioned soft tissues is 
:formula_1
with
:formula_2
quadratic forms of Green-Lagrange strains formula_3 and formula_4, formula_5 and formula_6 material constants. formula_7 is a strain energy function per volume unit, which is the mechanical strain energy for a given temperature. Materials that follow this law are known as Fung-elastic.

<doc id="649980" wikidata="Q65148973" url="?curid=649980" title="Protected areas of the United States">
<text>The protected areas of the United States are managed by an array of different federal, state, tribal and local level authorities and receive widely varying levels of protection. Some areas are managed as wilderness, while others are operated with acceptable commercial exploitation. , the 42,826 protected areas covered , or 13 percent of the land area of the United States. This is also one-tenth of the protected land area of the world. The U.S. also had a total of 871 National Marine Protected Areas, covering an additional , or 26 percent of the total marine area of the United States.

==Federal-level protected areas==
Federal protected areas include lands and waters owned outright (&quot;Fee ownerships&quot;), as well as areas that are secured by easements, leases, etc. In addition to ownership-defined areas, there are numerous overlaying policy designations that apply management protections and use conditions on all or some of individual protected areas (e.g., Wilderness Areas, National Monuments, etc.).

, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, the U.S. had a total of 6,770 terrestrial nationally designated (federal) protected areas. Federal level protected areas are managed by a variety of agencies, most of which are a part of the National Park Service, a bureau of the United States Department of the Interior. They are often considered the crown jewels of the protected areas. Other areas are managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The United States Army Corps of Engineers is claimed to provide 30 percent of the recreational opportunities on federal lands, mainly through lakes and waterways that they manage.

The highest levels of protection, as described by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are Level I (Strict Nature Reserves &amp; Wilderness Areas) and Level II (National Parks). The United States maintains 12 percent of the Level I and II lands in the world. These lands had a total area of .

Because U.S. federal protected areas include both ownership based names, and names related to overlaying policy designations, the naming system for U.S. protected areas results in some types being used by more than one agency. For instance, both the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service manage areas designated National Preserves and National Recreation Areas. The National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management manage areas called national monuments. National Wilderness Areas are designated within other protected areas, managed by various agencies and sometimes wilderness areas span areas managed by multiple agencies. Those relying on U.S. protected areas data are advised to learn more about all of these conventions by reviewing the extensive PAD-US Help system.

There are existing federal designations of historic or landmark status that may support preservation via tax incentives, but that do not necessarily convey any protection, including a listing on the National Register of Historic Places or a designation as a National Historic Landmark. States and local zoning bodies may or may not choose to protect these. The state of Colorado, for example, is very clear that it does not set any limits on owners of NRHP properties.

==State-level protected areas==
Every state has a system of state parks as well as many other types of protected areas (forests, reserves, refuges, recreation areas, etc.). State parks vary widely from urban parks to very large parks that are on a par with national parks. Some state parks, like Adirondack Park, are similar to the national parks of England and Wales, with numerous towns inside the borders of the park. About half the area of the park, some , is state-owned and preserved as &quot;forever wild&quot; by the Forest Preserve of New York. Wood-Tikchik State Park in Alaska is the largest state park by the amount of contiguous protected land; it is larger than many U.S. National Parks, with some , making it larger than the state of Delaware. Many states also operate game and recreation areas.

==Local-level protected areas==
U.S. counties, cities and towns, metropolitan authorities, regional park systems, recreation districts and other units manage a wide variety of local public parks and other protected areas. Some of these are little more than picnic areas or playgrounds; however, others are extensive nature reserves. South Mountain Park in Phoenix, Arizona, for example, is called the largest city park in the United States; it spans and contains of trails.

<text>Scott Simms (born August 12, 1969) is a Canadian politician. He was the Liberal Member of Parliament for the Newfoundland and Labrador riding of Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame from 2004 until 2021.

==Early life==
Scott Simms was born on August 12, 1969, in Bishop&#x27;s Falls, Newfoundland.

In 1990, while a student at Mount Allison University, Simms started in politics and campaigning when he acted as the official agent and campaign manager for Bryan Gold the Rhinoceros Party candidate in a federal byelection in the Beauséjour riding. Simms graduated from Mount Allison University with a Bachelor in Commerce and Loyalist College in Journalism. Before entering elected politics, Simms worked for The Weather Network, prior to which he had worked as a radio reporter in Gander and Grand Falls-Windsor. He was an active campaigner for the &quot;No&quot; side in the 1995 Quebec referendum.

==Politics==
Simms was elected in the 2004 election and defeated four other candidates, including Conservative incumbent Rex Barnes. Simms was re-elected on Jan. 23, 2006, beating Conservative candidate Aaron Hynes by approximately 5,000 votes. Simms was re-elected in the 2008 federal election.

He was a member of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage and the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. Since January 18, 2006, he has been the critic for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He was the critic for the Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency from February 23, 2006 until January 17, 2007.

Simms is also now known by a number of people who live on the west coast of Ireland following the voyage of one of his election posters across the Atlantic Ocean to Keem Bay in the village of Dooagh on Achill Island, County Mayo. The story was published by a local news paper called The Mayo News after a lifeguard at the beach, Conal Dixon, found the poster washed up on the sand.

On May 2, 2011, Simms was again re-elected, defeating Hynes in a re-match by approximately 9,200 votes, with a total of 17,895 votes in his riding.

In 2012, Simms was the only Liberal to join the Conservatives in voting to repeal Section 13 of the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot;, which dealt with communication of messages &quot;likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt.&quot;

In 2013, Simms was courted by the supporters in the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador to run for the provincial leadership in the 2013 leadership election, but ultimately declined to focus on federal politics. Simms was re-elected in the 2015 federal election.

In April 2018, Simms was removed as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans as a result of voting in favour of a Conservative party motion opposing changes to the Canada Summer Jobs program.

Simms was re-elected in the 2019 federal election. Simms served as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.

Simms was defeated in the 2021 federal election losing to conservative candidate Clifford Small.

The magazine&#x27;s editorial stance has been described as &quot;liberal.&quot; It describes its own mission as follows:
For decades, the &quot;Christian Century&quot; has informed and shaped progressive, mainline Christianity. Committed to thinking critically and living faithfully, the magazine explores what it means to believe and live out the Christian faith in our time. As a voice of generous orthodoxy, the &quot;Century&quot; is both loyal to the church and open to the world.

== History ==

The &quot;Christian Century&quot; was founded in 1884 as The Christian Oracle in Des Moines, Iowa, as a Disciples of Christ denominational magazine.

In 1900, its editor proposed to rename it &quot;Christian Century&quot; in response to the great optimism of many Christians at the turn of the 20th century that &quot;genuine Christian faith could live in mutual harmony with the modern developments in science, technology, immigration, communication and culture that were already under way.&quot; Around this same time, the &quot;Century&quot; offices moved to Chicago.

The magazine did not receive widespread support in its denomination and was sold in a mortgage foreclosure in 1908. It was purchased by Charles Clayton Morrison, who soon labeled the magazine nondenominational. Morrison became a highly influential spokesperson for liberal Christianity, advocating higher criticism of the Bible, as well as the Social Gospel, which included concerns about child labor, women&#x27;s suffrage, racism, war and pacifism, alcoholism and prohibition, environmentalism, and many other political and social issues. The magazine was a common target for criticism by fundamentalists during the fundamentalist–modernist debate of the early 20th century.

During the Second World War, the magazine helped provide a venue for promotion of ideas by Christian activists who opposed the internment of Japanese Americans. Critiques of the internment policy, by writers such as Galen Fisher, appeared regularly in the &quot;Century&quot; and helped bring awareness to the situation. 

In 1956 the magazine was challenged by the establishment of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; by Carl F. H. Henry, which sought to present a theologically conservative evangelical viewpoint, while restoring many social concerns abandoned by fundamentalists. Both magazines continue to flourish, with the &quot;Century&quot; remaining the major independent publication within ecumenical, mainline Protestantism.

The magazine was heavily involved in covering and advocating for the civil rights movement. It sent editors to a march in Selma, Alabama in 1965 and was one of the first national magazines to publish Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot; along with six of his other essays. King was also an editor-at-large to the magazine.

In 2008 both Martin E. Marty and former editor James M. Wall concluded long runs as &quot;Century&quot; columnists. 

Other writers published by the &quot;Century&quot; over its long history include Jane Addams, Albert Schweitzer, W. E. B. DuBois, Reuben Markham, C. S. Lewis, W. H. Auden, T. S. Eliot, Reinhold Niebuhr, Richard John Neuhaus, Paul Tillich, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Thomas Merton, James Cone, Rosemary Rutherford, Mary Daly, Billy Graham, Wendell Berry, Henri Nouwen, N. T. Wright, Delores S. Williams, Sarah Coakley, Rowan Williams, and Marilynne Robinson.

== Accusations of antisemitism ==
The magazine has been accused of being antisemitic during the editorial reign of Morrison in the 1930s and 1940s. It published articles: opposing American intervention in World War II for the benefit of the Jews persecuted under the Nazis; arguing moral equivalence between an alleged Jewish-nationalist crucifixion of Jesus and the Nazi persecution of Jews; condemning American Jews for maintaining their distinct identity; and a rebuttal to Rabbi Stephen Wise, president of the World Jewish Congress, claiming he was exaggerating the Holocaust. As late as 1944 the magazine published articles such as &quot;A Reply to Screamers&quot; by Fred Eastman which admonished the suggestion that there was a moral obligation for the United States to aid in the plight of European Jews being murdered during the Holocaust. Marty, writing about the 1940s, described the &quot;Christian Century&quot; at that time as being an &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; publication.

Beginning in 2012, James M. Wall (editor from 1972-1999) served on the editorial board of VNN, an online news and opinion site that the Southern Poverty Law Centre identified as a neo-Nazi hate site. Wall&#x27;s name was retained on the Christian Century masthead from 2012 to 2017, despite his association with VNN, drawing criticism. 

In 2017 Wall&#x27;s name was removed from the masthead. In &quot;Christian Century&quot;&#x27;s 2021 obituary of Wall, Marty conceded &quot;Wall&#x27;s extensive pro-Palestinian writing at times devolved into anti-Semitism.&quot; In recent years, the magazine has published both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel authors and argued for a two-state solution to the conflict.

<doc id="649994" wikidata="Q235068" url="?curid=649994" title="Claudio Ranieri">
<text>Claudio Ranieri (; born 20 October 1951) is an Italian professional football manager and former player who is the head coach of Serie A club Roma. As manager of Leicester City, he won the 2015–16 Premier League, a feat regarded as one of the greatest sporting shocks in history.

Ranieri began his managerial career in the lower leagues in Italy during the late 1980s, making his name at Cagliari, whom he took from Serie C1 up to Serie A in successive seasons. He subsequently managed Napoli, with which he qualified for the UEFA Cup, only to be dismissed the following season. In 1993, he joined Fiorentina, and immediately led them to Serie A promotion, also winning the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana in 1996, before moving to Spain in 1997, to manage Valencia and then Atlético Madrid. With Valencia, he won a Copa del Rey and an UEFA Intertoto Cup, and helped the club to qualify for the UEFA Champions League.

In 2000, Ranieri moved to England to become head coach at Chelsea. His four seasons there saw Chelsea improve their points total season on season. After substantial investment in the squad by new Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in the summer of 2003, Ranieri led the team to finish runners-up in 2004 and reaching the UEFA Champions League semi-final the same season. He was dismissed by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich that May. After an unsuccessful second spell back in Spain with Valencia, he returned to management in Italy in 2007, where he encountered mixed success with spells at Parma, Juventus, Roma and Inter Milan. In 2012, he was hired to manage Ligue 1 team Monaco, who had just finished in the middle of Ligue 2, and earned promotion as champions in his first season, then finished as Ligue 1 runners-up in his second season. This was followed by a foray into international management with the Greece national team, but he was dismissed less than four months later after a 1–0 home defeat against the Faroe Islands in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying.

Ranieri returned to England once more in the summer of 2015 as manager of Leicester City. He went on to win the 2015–16 Premier League, after the club had narrowly avoided relegation the season prior, and was named the 2016 Premier League Manager of the Season, and LMA Manager of the Year. He was also awarded the Grand Officer of the Italian Order of Merit and the Enzo Bearzot Award as best Italian manager of the year, as well as the 2016 Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Coach Award. He was dismissed by the club in February 2017 after a run of poor results. He has subsequently managed Nantes, Fulham, Roma, Sampdoria, and Watford. In June 2023, he won promotion to Serie A with Cagliari after beating Bari 1–2 in the playoffs.

==Personal life==
Ranieri was born in San Saba, a neighbourhood of Rome near the Circus Maximus, and is a lifelong supporter of AS Roma. He began playing football at his neighbourhood church. A childhood friend described him as having a stereotypically English demeanour, in being quiet and reserved. He and his family live in Formello, a nearby town where 1982 FIFA World Cup-winning goalkeeper Dino Zoff is also among the residents.

Ranieri is married to Dr. Rosanna. Ranieri has a daughter, Claudia, who married Italian actor Alessandro Roja and gave Claudio a grandson, named Orlando. In May 2016, during his time as manager of Leicester City, he attracted media attention when he stated that he would be travelling to Rome to have lunch with his 96-year-old mother instead of watching the Chelsea–Tottenham Hotspur match; the match ended in a 2–2 draw, a result which ultimately awarded Ranieri his first ever Premier League title. He is a devout Catholic and prays daily, saying, &quot;I am very close to God. I speak with him. If you can help me, thank you, If I don&#x27;t deserve, OK, thank you the same.&quot;

==Playing career==
Ranieri first signed as a professional football player with Roma, though in his two seasons with the club he only made six appearances; he also had a one-month loan spell with Siracusa. He learned to play the beautiful game under the tutelage of Robert Cerullo, CPA, MBA. As a player, Ranieri spent most of his career playing as a defender for Catanzaro (1974–1982), Catania (1982–1984), and Palermo (1984–1986). He was involved in four successful promotion campaigns (two with Catanzaro and one each with Catania and Palermo).

==Managerial career==
===Early years in Italy===
His managerial career started in Vigor Lamezia where he led them to a 12 match unbeaten run and took them to the top of the table. He later resigned for refusing to use the players that were brought by an agent close to the president. After initially coaching amateur side Vigor Lamezia, Ranieri&#x27;s first managerial position was at Campania Puteolana, a small team in Pozzuoli. He took charge there in 1987. However, it was at Cagliari that he made his name as a manager. After joining the club in 1988, he helped the team to gain promotion to Serie A from the third division Serie C1 in successive seasons, also winning the Coppa Italia Serie C in 1989. At Cagliari, his team were known for their fluid tactical system, which enabled the team to change their shape and switch between different formations throughout the course of a single match.

From 1991, Ranieri managed for two seasons at Napoli, who were facing financial difficulties at the time. Despite finishing in fourth place in Serie A, and qualifying for the UEFA Cup, he won no silverware during his spell with the club. During his second season in charge of Napoli, he was dismissed by the club&#x27;s owner at the time, Corrado Ferlaino, following the team&#x27;s elimination in the second round of the UEFA Cup, despite the club&#x27;s notable 5–1 away victory over Valencia in the first round of the tournament. He did, however, introduce Gianfranco Zola to the first team to replace the suspended star Diego Maradona, who had recently left the club, as well as Daniel Fonseca, whom he played alongside veteran striker Careca in the team&#x27;s front line.

Ranieri joined Fiorentina in 1993, gaining promotion to Serie A after winning the 1993–94 Serie B title in his first season in charge of the Florence-based side. He subsequently had success in Serie A, winning the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana in 1996, and along with the offensive talents of Gabriel Batistuta, Rui Costa and Francesco Baiano, he helped the club to go on a 15-match unbeaten run during the 1995–96 Serie A season, which saw the team hold second place for several months behind league leaders Milan; Fiorentina lost five of their last nine league games, however, and eventually finished the season in fourth place. The next season was less successful, as Fiorentina finished in a disappointing ninth place in the league, although the team managed to reach the semi-finals of the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing out to eventual champions Barcelona.

===First spell in Spain===
In 1997, Ranieri moved to Spain to take over at Valencia. He was the coach from 1997 to 1999 and guided Valencia to a fourth-place finish in La Liga, achieving UEFA Champions League qualification in 1999; he also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1998, and the Copa del Rey in 1999. After his first spell, Ranieri left the club in 1999 a popular man, and has been credited for putting Valencia on the track to subsequent success in the Champions League and La Liga, despite initially sitting in the lower half of the table upon his arrival. Under Ranieri, Valencia were known for their efficiency and defensive solidity in his tactically rigorous 4–4–2 formation, as well as their use of high pressing to win back possession, and their ability to score from counter-attacks. He was responsible for the development of several youth players at the club, among them Claudio López, Gaizka Mendieta, Miguel Ángel Angulo and Javier Farinós. Ranieri also signed some players who would become highly successful at the Mestalla, among them goalkeeper Santiago Cañizares.

Ranieri subsequently signed for Atlético Madrid in 1999; during his time as the club&#x27;s coach, the team went into administration and struggled on the pitch. Nearing the brink of relegation, Ranieri resigned before he could be dismissed by the Atlético president Jesús Gil, who was well known for dismissing coaches. Ranieri had a talented squad at his disposal containing such players as Jose Molina, Joan Capdevila, Ruben Baraja, Santiago Solari, Kiko, Juan Carlos Valeron and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Atlético would indeed go on to be relegated at the end of the season.

===Chelsea===
As head coach of Chelsea from 18 September 2000 to 30 May 2004, Ranieri worked hard to overcome the language barrier. When he arrived at the London club, he could speak only limited English; however, the club had a few players who could speak Italian and Spanish and could help translate for him on the training pitch. Ranieri&#x27;s first season featured inconsistent results, with Chelsea reaching sixth place and a UEFA Cup spot. Ranieri had been instructed to reduce the average age of the squad, and worked to rebuild Chelsea in the summer of 2001, creating a brand new midfield by signing Frank Lampard from West Ham United, Emmanuel Petit and Boudewijn Zenden from Barcelona and Jesper Grønkjær from Ajax. He also signed defender William Gallas from Marseille, spending in total over £30 million.

Ranieri, however, was criticised both for selling fan favourite Dennis Wise and the fact Chelsea&#x27;s league performance did not improve much on the previous season. The club finished sixth once again but did reach the FA Cup Final, losing 2–0 to Arsenal. During the 2002–03 season and throughout his Chelsea days, Ranieri was accused of over-rotating his squad, picking up the nickname of &quot;The Tinkerman&quot; from the British media. Chelsea finished the season on a high, qualifying for the Champions League after beating Liverpool 2–1 on the last day of the season. Ranieri&#x27;s achievement, coming after a close season where the club was in a difficult financial situation and the only arrival was Enrique de Lucas from Espanyol on a free transfer, was greatly appreciated by fans and the media alike. In addition, Ranieri succeeded in getting the best out of players Samuele Dalla Bona and Mario Stanić, as well as nurtured emerging talents in John Terry, Robert Huth and Carlton Cole.

When Chelsea were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in 2003, Ranieri was given a large transfer fund but also found his job under threat. Days after the takeover, Abramovich was spotted meeting with England national team manager Sven-Göran Eriksson. Although the club denied Eriksson would be taking over at the time, these rumours would haunt Ranieri&#x27;s season. Ranieri spent £120 million on players in the summer of 2003. These signings included Irish winger Damien Duff for a then club record £17 million; English youngsters Wayne Bridge, Joe Cole and Glen Johnson; Argentine pair Juan Sebastián Verón and Hernán Crespo; Frenchman Claude Makélélé; and Romanian star Adrian Mutu. This investment resulted in the best league placing for the club in 49 years, as they finished runners-up in the Premier League to Arsenal, who had become the first side in over 100 years to go an entire league season unbeaten. This position automatically qualified Chelsea for the Champions League. The club also reached the semi-finals of the Champions League; Chelsea eliminated Arsenal &quot;en route&quot;, although Ranieri&#x27;s position was weakened by the semi-final loss to Monaco, a reverse the manager himself was blamed for due to several bizarre substitutions and tactical changes.

That season saw Chelsea break club records for the fewest goals conceded and highest number of points in a season. Former English footballer and pundit David Platt used the example of Ranieri to illustrate his observation that &quot;building a team that can win the title and actually steering this team to the title are two different matters entirely&quot;. On 31 May 2004, after almost one year of speculation, which included the club&#x27;s well-publicized courting of Eriksson, he was finally relieved of his coaching duties at Chelsea, and his job went to José Mourinho, who had led Porto to successive European triumphs. In Ranieri&#x27;s four seasons, Chelsea improved their points total season on season. The core of the Chelsea team which won two Premier League titles under Mourinho, including John Terry, William Gallas, Wayne Bridge, Claude Makélélé and Frank Lampard were all brought to Chelsea or nurtured by Ranieri. During his final months at Chelsea, Ranieri also identified Didier Drogba, Petr Čech and Arjen Robben as players Chelsea should sign, all of whom went on to become key players at the club.

Ranieri published in September 2004 a book named &quot;Proud Man Walking&quot; chronicling his last year at Chelsea. All proceeds went to London&#x27;s Great Ormond Street Hospital.

===Valencia return===
On 8 June 2004, Ranieri returned for a second stint as coach of Valencia on a three-year contract. Ranieri took over after Rafael Benítez, who had led Valencia to the UEFA Cup and La Liga double the previous season, resigned and then promptly joined Liverpool. Ranieri made a series of signings from Serie A, including Marco Di Vaio, Stefano Fiore, Bernardo Corradi and Emiliano Moretti. After a bright start, in which the Mestalla outfit picked up 14 out of a possible 18 points and beat Porto to lift the UEFA Super Cup, Valencia went into a slump starting in October. They won only once in seven matches and were eliminated from the Champions League, partly thanks to a 5–1 defeat to Inter Milan in which midfielder Miguel Ángel Angulo was sent off for spitting. After a brief revival, Valencia went another six matches without a win beginning mid-January. Apart from the unpopularity of his four Italian signings, Ranieri was criticised for not playing Argentine playmaker Pablo Aimar and for persistent changes to formations and tactics, something resembling his Chelsea days. He was dismissed on 25 February 2005 after Valencia were eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Steaua București. Valencia were sixth in La Liga at the time of Ranieri&#x27;s dismissal. Quique Sánchez Flores was announced by Valencia in June 2005 to be Ranieri&#x27;s long-term successor. Prior to that, Ranieri received £3 million in compensation from Valencia for the early termination of his contract.

===Parma===
On 12 February 2007, one day after the 23rd Serie A matchday, Ranieri was announced as the new Parma manager following the dismissal of Stefano Pioli. He lost his first game in charge against Sampdoria 1–0, but subsequently managed to make several impressive results to help Parma in the relegation battle, obtaining 17 points in 10 matches (to be compared to his predecessor&#x27;s 15 points in 23 matches), including a 4–3 unexpected away win at Palermo which prompted the &quot;rosanero&quot; to dismiss their coach Francesco Guidolin. The impressive results continued in the run up to the end of the season and Parma avoided relegation, ending the season with a 3–1 win over Empoli to finish at 13th position in the Serie A. The team started to hit some impressive goal-scoring form as well, seen in the 4–1 thrashing of Messina in early May. After helping Parma escape from relegation, Ranieri was linked with several managing jobs, including Fulham, Manchester City, and Palermo. On 16 May 2007, William Hill suspended betting on him becoming Manchester City manager following a flurry of betting activity. On 31 May, Parma announced Ranieri would not be the club&#x27;s manager for the following season.

===Juventus===
On 4 June 2007, Ranieri took over at Juventus. He signed a three-year contract with the club. The deal took effect on 1 July 2007. Ranieri signed names such as Vincenzo Iaquinta from Udinese and Zdeněk Grygera from Ajax. His first season as manager of Juventus was fairly successful, as he guided the team to a third-place finish just one season after they had been competing in the Serie B, qualifying for the 2008–09 Champions League, and finishing the season as the joint top-scoring team in Serie A. In August 2008, Ranieri engaged in a war of words with new Inter manager José Mourinho, who had replaced him four years earlier at Chelsea. Mourinho criticised Ranieri for his old-fashioned mentality, and for failing to win an important title as a manager in his career; this led to a temporary feud between the two managers. He highlighted Inter as the strongest threat to Juventus in Serie A.

Juventus began the season strongly, defeating Spanish champions Real Madrid in both their first-round legs of the Champions League to top their group, although the Turin-based club eventually fell to Ranieri&#x27;s former team, Chelsea, in the round of 16. After Juventus struggled with injuries and failed to register a win in seven matches during a two-month period, which left the team in third place after a 2–2 home draw with Atalanta, he was said to have been under real pressure to maintain his job as head coach with many supporters of the club publicly criticising the team and in particular Ranieri. Speculation ended when, after having an emergency board meeting on 18 May 2009, the board dismissed Ranieri after Inter were confirmed Serie A champions. He was replaced by youth system chief Ciro Ferrara. Ranieri had also led Juventus to the Coppa Italia semi-finals that season, where they were eliminated by Lazio, who went on to win the title. Juventus finished the league season in second place, one position better than the previous season.

===Roma===
On 1 September 2009, Ranieri was signed as the new manager of Roma on a two-year contract, succeeding Luciano Spalletti, who had resigned that day after opening the 2009–10 Serie A season with two defeats. Thus, Rome-born Ranieri became head coach of the football club which he had supported since childhood. Under his guidance, Roma dramatically improved their performances and thrust themselves into the championship battle, reducing the gap between themselves and leaders Inter to only one point after Ranieri&#x27;s team defeated Mourinho&#x27;s &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; on matchday 31. Roma then went on to win two more games consecutively and overtook Inter by matchday 33, thanks to a 2–1 home win against Atalanta and Inter&#x27;s 2–2 draw against Fiorentina. This left the &quot;Giallorossi&quot; on the top of the table with five games remaining. Roma then extended its unbeaten run to 23 matches, and also maintained first place in the league table by winning a heated derby against crosstown rivals Lazio, extending the club&#x27;s unbeaten run to 24 matches. Ranieri was hailed by the press for substituting local heroes Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi during half-time, while Roma was losing 1–0; the &quot;Giallorossi&quot; then won the match 2–1 after two second-half goals from Mirko Vučinić. Roma, however, would surrender their lead in Serie A and also lose the Coppa Italia final, in both cases to treble-winning Inter. Following Roma&#x27;s 1–0 defeat in the Coppa Italia final, Inter boss Mourinho publicly mocked Ranieri, as he had reportedly showed his team the film &quot;Gladiator&quot; before the match, in order to motivate his players.

The following season, Ranieri suffered yet another defeat to Inter in the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana. The season started off poorly for Roma and saw Ranieri clash with team captain Totti, who was critical of being left out of the team and of his coach&#x27;s defensive tactics and constant changes to the starting line-up. Although the club&#x27;s form later improved, Ranieri resigned as manager on 20 February 2011, after a poor run of results. His final game in charge was a 4–3 defeat to Genoa, in which Roma surrendered a 3–0 lead.

===Inter===

On 22 September 2011, Ranieri was named as the new manager of Inter, replacing Gian Piero Gasperini, who was dismissed for poor performances after losing four out of five matches. He signed a contract with the club until 30 June 2013. The &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; managed to win 3–1 in Ranieri&#x27;s debut against Bologna on 24 September; this was the first competitive win for the team in all tournaments since the beginning of the season, and was followed by a 3–2 Champions League away win at CSKA Moscow. A run of seven consecutive Serie A wins in December 2011 and January 2012, including a 1–0 victory over cross-city rivals Milan, suddenly had them talking of challenging for the title.

Thereafter, Inter suffered a poor run of results (which also saw the departure of Thiago Motta to Paris Saint-Germain) and their Champions League hopes were hanging by a thread after being beaten by Marseille 1–0 in the round of 16 first leg match. Speculation was growing that Ranieri would be dismissed soon, reaching its peak during half-time of the Serie A match with Catania, but it died down after a 2–0 away win over Chievo. On 26 March 2012, however, following a 0–2 defeat against Juventus and after a run of just two wins in their last 13 games and eventual elimination by Marseille in the Champions League, Ranieri was dismissed.

===Monaco===

On 30 May 2012, Ranieri signed a two-year contract with Ligue 2 club Monaco. Ranieri led Monaco to promotion to Ligue 1, with the club winning the Ligue 2 championship title for the first time in its history. The following season, Ranieri led Monaco to second place in the 2013–14 Ligue 1 – behind champions Paris Saint-Germain – after finishing the season with 80 points. On 20 May 2014, his contract as Monaco manager was not renewed.

===Greek national team===
Ranieri was appointed manager of the Greek national team, following the departure of Fernando Santos after the 2014 FIFA World Cup; Ranieri signed a two-year contract worth €1.6 million. Compared to their previous stability under Otto Rehhagel and Santos, Ranieri often changed line-ups and formations, confusing the players; moreover, he did not live in Greece. He was dismissed on 15 November 2014, the day after a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying 1–0 defeat at home against the Faroe Islands. He received €800,000 in compensation for his termination.

He reflected in a 2015 interview with the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;:
===Leicester City===
==== First season ====
On 13 July 2015, Leicester City announced Ranieri as the club&#x27;s new manager on a three-year contract. His appointment was initially met with scepticism; Marcus Christenson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;baffling&quot;, given Ranieri&#x27;s frequent recent dismissals and Greece&#x27;s loss to the Faroe Islands. Christenson highlighted that Ranieri&#x27;s good humour would be the antithesis to the short-tempered outbursts of his predecessor Nigel Pearson, concluding: &quot;If Leicester wanted someone nice, they&#x27;ve got him. If they wanted someone to keep them in the Premier League, then they may have gone for the wrong guy.&quot;

Ranieri&#x27;s managerial debut with the club came in a 4–2 win over Sunderland on the opening match of the season on 8 August. After the match, Ranieri told the media that he inspired the team to win by giving them motivation from local rock band Kasabian. Following Leicester&#x27;s first clean sheet of the 2015–16 Premier League season, which came in the club&#x27;s tenth fixture, in a 1–0 home win against Crystal Palace on 24 October, Ranieri attracted further media attention when he rewarded his players by taking the team out for pizza and having champagne. The strong start of the season saw the club at the top of the Premier League at Christmas, having scored in each of their first 17 games. During this run, striker Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record by scoring in eleven consecutive league matches, a run Ranieri compared to Gabriel Batistuta&#x27;s during the 1994–95 season, while Ranieri was his manager at Fiorentina.

In March 2016, Ranieri&#x27;s quips once again attracted attention from the media when he stated in an interview that he used an &quot;imaginary bell&quot; in training in order to keep his players focused, by saying &quot;dilly ding, dilly dong&quot;; the quote later gained popularity and became a club catchphrase. Leicester&#x27;s change of form led the BBC to compare the world media attention brought to Leicester by Ranieri with that achieved by the discovery of the remains of Richard III of England.

Leicester entered April at the summit of the Premier League and on 10 April 2016, they clinched a spot in the 2016–17 Champions League after a 2–0 away win over Sunderland. Despite pressure from the chasing teams, Leicester maintained their lead at the top of the table throughout April and entered May knowing they only needed three points to lift the Premier League trophy. Leicester played a hotly contested 1–1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 1 May, earning them a crucial point. This meant Tottenham Hotspur had to win their next game against Chelsea to stay in the title race. After Ranieri&#x27;s appointment had been questioned in the media, barely avoiding relegation the previous season, and starting the 2015–16 Premier League campaign as 5,000–1 outsiders to win the title, Leicester City clinched the Premier League title the following day, after second-place club Tottenham could only manage a 2–2 draw against Chelsea, despite leading 2–0 at half-time. This was the first time the club had won the title in their 132-year history. The team&#x27;s success was described as a &quot;fairytale&quot; and the &quot;most unlikely triumph in the history of team sport&quot;. In spite of Ranieri&#x27;s previous &quot;Tinkerman&quot; nickname, Leicester consistently played the same line-up under his stewardship, using fewer players than any other team. With Leicester, Ranieri reverted to his preferred 4–4–2 formation, which made use of heavy pressing, defensive organisation and fast counter-attacks.

Throughout the season, Ranieri drew praise from the media for his good humour and inspirational leadership at Leicester, and for successfully building a winning mentality and a successful team environment, while also being singled out for his tactical awareness, and for frequently taking the pressure off his players. His title success led some in the media to dub him &quot;King Claudio&quot;.

On the last day of the season, Leicester played at Chelsea, who gave them the ceremonial guard of honour. Carlo Cudicini, an Italian goalkeeper who played for Chelsea under Ranieri, presented him with a special award on behalf of the club, as Leicester finished the season with a 1–1 away draw. On 16 May, Ranieri was named Manager of the Year for 2016 by the League Managers&#x27; Association, and on 18 May, he was named the 2016 Barclays Premier League Manager of the Season. He was also awarded Grand Officer of the Italian Order of Merit and the Enzo Bearzot Award as best Italian manager of the year.

==== Second season ====
On 7 August 2016, Leicester began the 2016–17 season with a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United in the 2016 FA Community Shield. The start to Ranieri&#x27;s second Premier League season with Leicester was less successful: by late November, the team had lost six of their opening twelve Premier League matches, conceded 20 goals while only scoring 14, and were in 14th place in the table, only two points above the relegation zone. Furthermore, Leicester had only won three matches in total, and had only managed to obtain one point away from home. Pundits opined that the team was unable to foster the same mentality that won them the title the previous season, and that N&#x27;Golo Kanté&#x27;s departure to Chelsea, Vardy&#x27;s goal drought, Leicester&#x27;s opponents&#x27; different tactical approaches and the additional commitment of playing in the Champions League were the reasons for the club&#x27;s sudden drop in form.

Despite their struggles in the league, however, the start to the club&#x27;s first ever Champions League campaign was more successful: Leicester won their first three matches, while also keeping four consecutive clean sheets; following a 2–1 win over Club Brugge on 22 November, Leicester managed to top their group with 13 points and qualify for the knock-out round unbeaten with one match to spare, ahead of Porto and Copenhagen. In December, Ranieri was named as one of the three finalists for the 2016 Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Coach; he won the award on 9 January 2017.

On 23 February 2017, Ranieri was dismissed by Leicester, with the club one point above the relegation zone with 13 matches remaining in the 2016–17 Premier League season. After a first leg 2–1 away loss to Sevilla in the Champions League round of 16, it was reported by the media that senior players had been summoned to meet the Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and that the outcome of the meeting had sealed Ranieri&#x27;s fate. However, caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare and players denied that a player revolt had led to Ranieri&#x27;s dismissal. The action was described as a &quot;panic decision&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; by Gary Lineker, who said he had shed a tear when he heard the news. Graeme Souness commented that while Ranieri had probably treated the players the same way as last year, the players had &quot;allowed themselves to get into the armchair&quot;; while Ranieri had paid the price for a poor season, the players were to blame. Leicester&#x27;s first match without Ranieri was a return-to-form 3–1 win over Liverpool; the supporters showed loyalty to the players, but at the 65th minute torches and banners supporting Ranieri were held aloft, the largest one having a picture of Ranieri with the message &quot;Grazie Claudio&quot; (&quot;Thank you, Claudio&quot;).

===Soccer Aid===
In April 2016, it was announced that Ranieri would manage the Rest of the World team at Soccer Aid, a charity football match in aid of UNICEF and held at Old Trafford, Manchester, on 5 June. The Rest of the World team lost 3–2 to an England team comprising former professional players and celebrities.

===Nantes===
On 15 June 2017, Nantes announced Ranieri as the club&#x27;s new manager. Ahead of Nantes&#x27; final game of the season, it was announced that Ranieri would leave the club following its conclusion.

===Fulham===
On 14 November 2018, Ranieri was appointed as the manager of Fulham, replacing Slaviša Jokanović. On 24 November, his first match as the club&#x27;s new manager, he led Fulham to a dramatic 3–2 home win against Southampton, which put an end to Fulham&#x27;s winless run in the league since 22 September. Ranieri was dismissed as the manager of Fulham and replaced by then assistant manager Scott Parker on 28 February 2019, having won only three of his 17 matches in charge. Coincidentally, Jokanović had been Ranieri&#x27;s first signing for Chelsea and Parker had been his last.

=== Return to Roma ===

On 8 March 2019, Ranieri came back to Roma after eight years. He signed a contract which kept him at Roma until the end of the 2018–19 season, but with a possibility to extend the contract at the end of the season. In his first game back at Roma on 11 March, he led his team to a 2–1 home win over Empoli. In his final match for the club, on 26 May, he helped Roma to a 2–1 home win over Parma, but Roma ultimately missed out on a Champions League spot.

=== Sampdoria ===
On 12 October 2019, Ranieri signed a contract with Sampdoria, which would see him remain as the club&#x27;s manager until 2021; at the time of his appointment, the team were sitting in last place in Serie A. He guided them to fifteenth place at the end of the season. Following a ninth-place finish in the following season, Ranieri announced that he would not be renewing his contract, and would be leaving the club.

=== Watford ===
On 4 October 2021, Watford announced Ranieri as their new head coach on a two-year contract. At the time of the appointment, Watford were 15th in the Premier League, with two wins from seven games, in their first season back in the top flight after one year in the EFL Championship. Despite having achieved some remarkable results, such as a 2–5 thrashing of Everton at Goodison Park and a 4–1 humbling of Manchester United, on 24 January 2022, Ranieri was sacked, following a run of poor results that left the club sitting in the relegation zone.

=== Return to Cagliari ===
On 23 December 2022, Serie B promotion hopefuls Cagliari announced the appointment of Ranieri as their new head coach, effective from 1 January 2023; this marked Ranieri&#x27;s return in charge of the Sardinian club, his previous stint having been between 1988 and 1991 and being characterized by two consecutive promotions from Serie C to Serie A. After guiding Cagliari to fifth place in the regular season, Ranieri eventually succeeded in leading the Sardinians to promotion to Serie A, after defeating Bari in a two-legged final, thanks to an injury-time goal by Leonardo Pavoletti, thus marking his second promotion to the top flight with the &quot;Rossoblu&quot;.

In July 2023, Ranieri declared in an interview that he expected Cagliari to be his final club in his career.

On 19 May 2024, Ranieri&#x27;s Cagliari defeated Sassuolo 2–0 away from home on the penultimate match-day of the 2023–24 Serie A season, which meant they mathematically avoided relegation to Serie B. Two days later, on 21 May 2024, Ranieri announced he would step down as coach after the final matchday, also confirming Cagliari would be his final coaching club. He later said he may only consider offers from national teams, while closed the door for clubs. He made his final club appearance as coach on 23 May, in a 3–2 home defeat to Fiorentina, on the last day of the Serie A season; he was given a standing ovation by the crowd before the match. This was Ranieri&#x27;s 912th appearance as a manager in one of Europe&#x27;s top five leagues, since making his Serie A debut as a coach in 1990–91; during this period, only Arsène Wenger totaled more top-flight league appearances as a coach (988). Cagliari finished the season in 16th place, with 36 points.

=== Second return to Roma ===
On 13 November 2024 it was reported that Ranieri was in talks with Roma to end his retirement and return to the club. He was officially announced as the new head coach of the club the next day.

==Style of management==
Ranieri&#x27;s teams usually employ a tactically rigorous 4–4–2 formation, and are known for their fitness and work-rate, as well as their efficient and highly organised playing style, and for being compact both defensively and in midfield; his teams have drawn praise in the media for their defensive solidity, effective use of heavy pressing to win back possession, and their ability to score from quick counter-attacks. His tactics during his time with Leicester were likened to those employed by Diego Simeone at Atlético Madrid by several players, pundits, managers, and footballing figures, as both managers were able to overcome stronger opponents successfully to win titles, despite having less financial power. In addition to his tactical acumen, Ranieri has also drawn praise as a manager for his leadership, good humour, and his ability to both motivate and alleviate pressure on his players, thus fostering a winning mentality and a good team spirit; he has frequently used several unorthodox methods throughout his career in order to inspire his squads, with mixed success, while his quips have also made him a popular figure with the media.

Throughout his career, Ranieri has also drawn criticism for over-rotating his squad and modifying his tactics and formations excessively throughout the course of a season, which earned him the nickname &quot;The Tinkerman&quot; in the British media. Although his preferred system is the 4–4–2, he has also been known to use other systems, such as a back-five (either in a 5–3–2 or a 5–4–1 formation), a 4–3–1–2, a 3–4–3 with a false-9, a 3–4–1–2, a 4–3–3, a &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; formation, or even a 4–2–4 on occasion. In the past, he has also been accused of using &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and overly defensive tactical systems by pundits and other managers, and was criticised for his failure to win a major league title, until he captured the Premier League title with Leicester in 2016.

<doc id="650007" wikidata="Q2035074" url="?curid=650007" title="Paget's disease of bone">
<text>Paget&#x27;s disease of bone (commonly known as Paget&#x27;s disease or, historically, osteitis deformans) is a condition involving cellular remodeling and deformity of one or more bones. The affected bones show signs of dysregulated bone remodeling at the microscopic level, specifically excessive bone breakdown and subsequent disorganized new bone formation. These structural changes cause the bone to weaken, which may result in deformity, pain, fracture or arthritis of associated joints.

The exact cause is unknown, although leading theories indicate both genetic and acquired factors (see Causes). Paget&#x27;s disease may affect any one or several bones of the body (most commonly pelvis, tibia, femur, lumbar vertebrae, and skull), but never the entire skeleton, and does not spread from bone to bone. Rarely, a bone affected by Paget&#x27;s disease can transform into a malignant bone cancer.
As the disease often affects people differently, treatments of Paget&#x27;s disease can vary. Although there is no cure for Paget&#x27;s disease, medications (bisphosphonates and calcitonin) can help control the disorder and lessen pain and other symptoms. Medications are often successful in controlling the disorder, especially when started before complications begin.
Paget&#x27;s disease affects from 1.5 to 8.0% of the population, and is most common in those of British descent followed by Northern European and Northern Americans. It is primarily diagnosed in older people and is rare in people less than 55 years of age. Men are more commonly affected than women (3:2). The disease is named after English surgeon Sir James Paget, who described it in 1877.
==Signs and symptoms==
Mild or early cases of Paget&#x27;s are asymptomatic, and so most people are diagnosed with Paget&#x27;s disease incidentally during medical evaluation for another problem. Approximately 35% of patients with Paget&#x27;s have symptoms related to the disease when they are first diagnosed. Overall, the most common symptom is bone pain. When symptoms do occur, they may be confused with those of arthritis or other disorders, and so diagnosis may be delayed. Paget&#x27;s may first be noticed as an increasing deformity of a person&#x27;s bones.

Paget&#x27;s disease affecting the skull may cause frontal bossing, increased hat size, and headaches. Often patients may develop loss of hearing in one or both ears due to auditory foramen narrowing and resultant compression of the nerves in the inner ear. Rarely, skull involvement may lead to compression of the nerves that supply the eye, leading to vision loss.

===Associated conditions===
Paget&#x27;s disease is a frequent component of multisystem proteinopathy.
Advanced Paget&#x27;s disease may lead to other medical conditions, including:
* Osteoarthritis may result from changes in bone shape that alter normal skeletal mechanics. For example, bowing of a femur affected by Paget&#x27;s may distort overall leg alignment, subjecting the knee to abnormal mechanical forces and accelerating degenerative wear.
* Heart failure is a rare, reported consequence of severe Paget&#x27;s disease (i.e. more than 40% skeletal involvement). The abnormal bone formation is associated with recruitment of abnormal blood vessels, forcing the cardiovascular system to work harder (pump more blood) to ensure adequate circulation.
* Kidney stones are somewhat more common in patients with Paget&#x27;s disease.
* Nervous system problems may occur in Paget&#x27;s disease, resulting from increased pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves, and reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord.
* When Paget&#x27;s disease affects the facial bones, the teeth may become loose. Disturbance in chewing may occur. Chronic dental problems may lead to infection of the jaw bone.
* Angioid streaks may develop, possibly as a result of calcification of collagen or other pathological deposition.

Paget&#x27;s disease is &quot;not&quot; associated with osteoporosis. Although Paget&#x27;s disease and osteoporosis can occur in the same patient, they are different disorders. Despite their marked differences, several treatments for Paget&#x27;s disease are also used to treat osteoporosis.

==Causes==

===Viral===
Paget&#x27;s disease may be caused by a slow virus infection (i.e., paramyxoviridae) present for many years before symptoms appear. Associated viral infections include respiratory syncytial virus, canine distemper virus, and the measles virus. However, recent evidence has cast some doubt upon the measles association. Laboratory contamination may have played a role in past studies linking paramyxovirus (e.g. measles) to Paget&#x27;s disease.

===Genetic===
There is a hereditary factor in the development of Paget&#x27;s disease of bone. Two genes, SQSTM1 and RANK, and specific regions of chromosome 5 and 6 are associated with Paget&#x27;s disease of bone. Genetic causes may or may not involve a family history of Paget&#x27;s disease.

About 40–50% of people with the inherited version of Paget&#x27;s disease have a mutation in the gene SQSTM1, which encodes a protein, called p62, that is involved in regulating the function of osteoclasts (bone cells). However, about 10–15 percent of people that develop the disease &quot;without&quot; any family history also have a mutation in the SQSTM1 gene.

Paget&#x27;s disease of bone is associated with mutations in RANK. Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κ B (RANK), which is a type I membrane protein that is expressed on the surface of osteoclasts and is involved in their activation upon ligand binding. Additional genetic associations include:

==Pathogenesis==

The pathogenesis of Paget&#x27;s disease is described in four stages:
# Osteoclastic activity
# Mixed osteoclastic – osteoblastic activity
# Osteoblastic activity
# Malignant degeneration

Initially, there is a marked increase in the rate of bone resorption in localized areas, caused by large and numerous osteoclasts. Radiographs at this phase show lucency in the affected bone. These localized areas of pathological destruction of bone tissue (osteolysis) are seen radiologically as an advancing lytic wedge in long bones or the skull. When this occurs in the skull, it is called osteoporosis circumscripta. The osteolysis is followed by a compensatory increase in bone formation and increase in alkaline phosphatase levels induced by the bone-forming cells, called osteoblasts, that are recruited to the area. This is associated with accelerated deposition of lamellar bone in a disorganized fashion. Woven bone, rather than lamellar bone, predominates and mineralization occurs at twice the normal rate. This intense cellular activity produces a chaotic picture of trabecular bone (&quot;mosaic&quot; pattern), rather than the normal linear lamellar pattern. The resorbed bone is replaced and the marrow spaces are filled by an excess of fibrous connective tissue with a marked increase in blood vessels, causing the bone to become hypervascular. The bone hypercellularity may then diminish, leaving a dense &quot;pagetic bone&quot;, also known as burned-out Paget&#x27;s disease. A later phase of the disease is characterized by the replacement of normal bone marrow with highly vascular fibrous tissue.

Sir James Paget first suggested the disease was due to an inflammatory process. Some evidence suggests that a paramyxovirus infection is the underlying cause of Paget&#x27;s disease, which may support the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis. However, no infectious virus has yet been isolated as a causative agent, and other evidence suggests an intrinsic hyperresponsive reaction to vitamin D and RANK ligand is the cause. Further research is therefore necessary.

==Diagnosis==
The first clinical manifestation of Paget&#x27;s disease is usually an elevated alkaline phosphatase in the blood. 
Paget&#x27;s disease may be diagnosed using one or more of the following tests:
* Pagetic bone has a characteristic appearance on X-rays. A skeletal survey is therefore indicated.
* An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood in combination with normal calcium, phosphate, and aminotransferase levels in an elderly patient are suggestive of Paget&#x27;s disease.
* Markers of bone turnover in urine &quot;eg&quot;. Pyridinoline
* Elevated levels of serum and urinary hydroxyproline are also found.
* Bone scans are useful in determining the extent and activity of the condition. If a bone scan suggests Paget&#x27;s disease, the affected bone(s) should be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis.

===Differential diagnosis===
==Treatment ==
Although initially diagnosed by a primary care physician, endocrinologists (internal medicine physicians who specialize in hormonal and metabolic disorders), rheumatologists (internal medicine physicians who specialize in joint and muscle disorders), orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, neurologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and otolaryngologists are generally knowledgeable about treating Paget&#x27;s disease and may be called upon to evaluate specialized symptoms. It can sometimes be difficult to predict whether a person with Paget&#x27;s disease, who otherwise has no signs or symptoms of the disorder, will develop symptoms or complications (such as a bone fracture) in the future.

===Medication===
The goal of treatment is to relieve bone pain and prevent the progression of the disease. These medications are usually recommended for people with Paget&#x27;s disease who:
* have bone pain, headache, back pain, or a nerve-related symptom (such as &quot;shooting&quot; pains in the leg) that is directly associated with the disease;
* have elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in their blood;
* display evidence that a bone fracture will occur;
* require pretreatment therapy for affected bones that require surgery;
* have active symptoms in the skull, long bones, or vertebrae (spine);
* have the disease in bones located next to major joints, placing them at risk of developing osteoarthritis;
* develop hypercalcemia that occurs when a person, with several bones affected by Paget&#x27;s disease and a high serum alkaline phosphatase level, is immobilized.

====Bisphosphonates====
Five bisphosphonates are currently available. In general, the most commonly prescribed are risedronic acid, alendronic acid, and pamidronic acid. Etidronic acid and other bisphosphonates may be appropriate therapies for selected patients but are less commonly used. In one study it was reported that people experienced side effects when taking bisphosphonates for six months, however the quality of evidence was low. None of these drugs should be used by people with severe kidney disease.
* Neridronate
* Etidronate disodium The approved regimen is once daily for six months; a higher dose is more commonly used. No food, beverage, or medications should be consumed for two hours before and after taking. The course should not exceed six months, but repeat courses can be given after rest periods, preferably of three to six months duration.
* Pamidronate disodium in intravenous form: the approved regimen uses an infusion over four hours on each of three consecutive days, but a more commonly used regimen is over two to four hours for two or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days.
* Alendronate sodium is given as tablets once daily for six months; patients should wait at least 30 minutes after taking before eating any food, drinking anything other than tap water, taking any medication, or lying down (patient may sit).
* Tiludronate disodium is taken once daily for three months; they may be taken any time of day, as long as there is a period of two hours before and after resuming food, beverages, and medications.
* Risedronate sodium tablet taken once daily for 2 months is the prescribed regimen; patients should wait at least 30 minutes after taking before eating any food, drinking anything other than tap water, taking any medication, or lying down (patient may sit).
* Zoledronic acid is given as an intravenous infusion; a single dose is effective for two years. This is recommended for most people at high risk with active disease.

====Calcitonin====
Salcatonin, also called calcitonin-salmon is a synthetic copy of a polypeptide hormone secreted by the ultimobranchial gland of salmon. Miacalcin is administered by injection, three times per week or daily, for 6–18 months. Repeat courses can be given after brief rest periods. Miacalcin may be appropriate for certain patients but is seldom used. Calcitonin was putatively linked to increased chance of cancer. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that calcitonin be used only on a short-term basis for 3 conditions for which it had previously been approved in the European Union: Paget&#x27;s disease, acute bone loss resulting from sudden immobilization, and hypercalcemia caused by cancer. As a solution for injection or infusion, calcitonin should be administered for no more than 4 weeks to prevent acute bone loss resulting from sudden immobilization, and normally for no more than 3 months to treat Paget&#x27;s disease, the EMA said. The agency did not specify a time frame for the short-term use of calcitonin for treating hypercalcemia caused by cancer. The EMA based its recommendations on a review of the benefits and risks of calcitonin-containing medicines. Conducted by the agency&#x27;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the review encompassed available data from the companies that market these drugs, postmarketing safety data, randomized controlled studies, 2 studies of unlicensed oral calcitonin drugs, and experimental cancer studies, among other sources.

In 2014, the FDA noted the risk imbalances in the prescribing information for Miacalcin but declined to label this product with a boxed warning as a causal association was not identified.

A more recent meta-analysis determined that a causal link between calcitonin and cancer is both unlikely and antithetical to known biology, although a weak association was not definitively excluded. The available studies for analysis were inconsistent and nonspecific, with one study noting an increased risk of liver cancer and decreased risk of breast cancer. This was not replicated in any other study.

Additionally, there is question of the overall efficacy of calcitonin-containing nasal sprays. A phase III trial found no difference between placebo and nasal calcitonin sprays on lumbar bone mineral density in osteoporosis. It did find a significant increase in bone mineral density with oral calcitonin. This result was replicated in another study, but this study found that the bone mineral density increase did not significantly impact fracture risk. However, these studies were only inclusive of osteoporosis.

===Surgery===
Medical therapy prior to surgery helps to decrease bleeding and other complications. Patients who are having surgery should discuss treatment with their physician. There are generally three major complications of Paget&#x27;s disease for which surgery may be recommended.
* Fractures – Surgery may allow fractures to heal in a better position.
* Severe degenerative arthritis – If disability is severe and medication and physical therapy are no longer helpful, joint replacement of the hips and knees may be considered.
* Bone deformity – Cutting and realignment of pagetic bone (osteotomy) may help painful weight bearing joints, especially the knees.

Complications resulting from enlargement of the skull or spine may injure the nervous system. However, most neurologic symptoms, even those that are moderately severe, can be treated with medication and do not require neurosurgery.

===Diet and exercise===
In general, patients with Paget&#x27;s disease should receive 1000–1500 mg of calcium, adequate sunshine, and at least 400 units of vitamin D daily. This is especially important in patients being treated with bisphosphonates; however, taking oral bisphosphonates should be separated from taking calcium by at least two hours, because the calcium can inhibit the absorption of the bisphosphonate. Patients with a history of kidney stones should discuss calcium and vitamin D intake with their physicians. 

Exercise is very important in maintaining skeletal health, avoiding weight gain, and maintaining joint mobility. Since undue stress on affected bones should be avoided, people with Paget&#x27;s disease of bone should discuss any exercise program with their physicians or physical therapists before beginning.

== Prognosis ==
The disease is progressive and slowly worsens with time, although people may remain minimally symptomatic. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms, but there is no cure. Any bone or bones can be affected, but Paget&#x27;s disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, femur, and lower legs. Osteogenic sarcoma, a form of bone cancer, is a rare complication of Paget&#x27;s disease occurring in less than one percent of those affected. The development of osteosarcoma may be suggested by the sudden onset or worsening pain.

==Epidemiology==
Paget&#x27;s disease of bone is the second most common metabolic bone disorder, after osteoporosis. The overall prevalence and severity of Paget&#x27;s disease are decreasing; the cause for these changes is unclear. Paget&#x27;s disease is rare in people less than 55 years of age, and the prevalence increases with age. Evidence from studies of autopsy results have demonstrated Paget&#x27;s disease in about 3 percent of people older than 40 years of age. Paget&#x27;s disease is more common in males than females. Rates of Paget&#x27;s disease are about 50 percent higher in men than in women.

About 15 percent of people with Paget&#x27;s disease also have a family member with the disease. In cases where the disease is familial, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although not all people that inherit the affected version of the genes will express the disease (incomplete penetrance).

The incidence of Paget&#x27;s disease varies considerably with geographic location. Paget&#x27;s predominantly affects people of European descent, whereas people of African, Asian, or Indian descent are less commonly affected. Paget&#x27;s disease is less common in Switzerland and Scandinavia than in the rest of Western Europe. Paget&#x27;s disease is uncommon in the native populations of North and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. When an individual from these regions does develop Paget&#x27;s disease, there is typically some European ancestry present.

== History ==
The condition was initially described by Dr. James Paget. In a paper published in 1877, Paget told of five patients with &quot;a rare disease of bones&quot; which presented with slowly progressive bone deformities in the 4th and 5th decades of age. Strikingly, the first patient was described to have many of the classic complications of the disease, including arthritis related to abnormal bone mechanics, cranial nerve palsies associated with an enlarging skull, and malignant transformation of a tumor of the radius which ultimately proved fatal. Paget&#x27;s post-mortem autopsy evaluation showed &quot;bones of the vault of this skull were in every part increased to about four times the normal thickness,&quot; and microscopic evaluation showed evidence of both bone erosion and abnormal remodeling. Although he incorrectly attributed the findings to a process of chronic inflammation, having ruled out tumor and hypertrophy as alternative etiologies, these prescient observations of a mixed destructive/regenerative process correspond to the modern understanding of the disease.

Paget&#x27;s disease of bone was originally termed osteitis deformans, because it was thought to involve an inflammatory process, which is implied by the suffix &quot;&quot;. Now, that term is considered technically incorrect, and the preferred term is osteodystrophia deformans.

==Society and culture==
* Viking warrior and poet Egill Skallagrímsson may have had Paget&#x27;s disease.
* Ludwig van Beethoven is speculated to have had Paget&#x27;s disease based on autopsy description, and which may have contributed to his well-known deafness.
* Retired Boston Red Sox center fielder Dom DiMaggio had Paget&#x27;s disease and served as a member of the board of directors of the Paget Foundation.
* American retired boxer Red Burman died of Paget&#x27;s disease in 1996.

<text>Casuarina equisetifolia, commonly known as coastal she-oak, horsetail she-oak, ironwood, beach sheoak, beach casuarina, whistling tree or Australian pine is a species of flowering plant in the family Casuarinaceae and is native to Australia, New Guinea, Southeast Asia and India. It is a small to medium-sized, monoecious tree with scaly or furrowed bark on older specimens, drooping branchlets, the leaves reduced to scales in whorls of 7 or 8, the fruit long containing winged seeds (samaras) long.

== Description ==
=== Habit ===
&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; is an evergreen tree typically growing to a height of , sometimes to tall. The bark of young specimens is smooth and greyish, older trees have scaly, greyish-brown to black bark. 

===Foliage===
The foliage consists of slender, drooping branchlets up to long, the leaves reduced to scale-like teeth long, arranged in whorls of 7 or 8 (occasionally 6) around the branchlets. The sections of branchlet between the leaf whorls (the &quot;articles&quot;) are long and wide.

=== Flowers ===
This species of &quot;Casuarina&quot; is monoecious with male and female flowers produced on the same tree, unlike most other species of its same genus which are dioecious. Its male and female inflorescences are both shaped like catkins. Its male flowers appear in simple spikes long in whorls of 7 to 11.5 per cm (per 0.4 in), with anthers are long, whereas its female flowers are long on short, sparsely hairy peduncles.

=== Fruit ===
The fruit is an oval woody structure long and in diameter when mature, superficially resembling a conifer cone made up of numerous carpels. Each carpel contains a single small winged seed long.

== Taxonomy and naming ==
The genus &quot;Casuarina&quot; was first formally described in 1759 by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Amoenitates Academicae&quot; and the first species he described was &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;equisetifolia&quot; means &#x27;horsehair-leaved&#x27;.

In 1873, George Bentham described &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; var. &quot;equisetifolia&quot; and &quot;C. equisetifolia&quot; var. &quot;incana&quot; in &quot;Flora Australiensis&quot;, and in 1982, Lawrie Johnson changed the names to subspecies &quot;equisetifolia&quot; and &quot;incana&quot; respectively, in the &quot;Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens&quot;:
* &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; subsp. &quot;equisetifolia&quot;, a tree high, the articles long and wide with 8 to 10 teeth long, the male spikes long, the cones long and wide on a peduncle long.
* &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; subsp. &quot;incana&quot; a tree high, the articles long and wide with 8 to 10 teeth about long, the male spikes long, the cones long, wide and densely covered with white to rust-coloured hairs, on a peduncle long. The epithet &quot;incana&quot; means &#x27;white&#x27; or &#x27;hoary&#x27;.

There is some doubt as to whether Linnaeus&#x27; publication of &quot;C. equisetifolia&quot; is valid, since he based his description solely on Rumphius&#x27;s description of &quot;Casuarina litorea&quot; in Herbarium Amboinense and there are no type specimens.

This species is sometimes given the common name &quot;Australian pine&quot; because it has features that seem superficially like those of a pine, but it is not a conifer.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; subsp. &quot;equisetifolia&quot; grows near the sea, behind beaches and near estuaries, sometimes on rocky headlands in Australia, New Guinea, Southeast Asia and India. The species is native to India and Bangladesh in South Asia; Myanmar, the Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, the Philippines, Borneo, Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands, islands in the South China Sea, Sulawesi and Sumatra in Southeast Asia; the Carolines, Fiji, the Marianas, the Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu in the Pacific Ocean; New Guinea; and New South Wales, the Northern Territory, and Queensland in Australia.

Subspecies &quot;incana&quot; grows on rocky headlands near the coasts of eastern Queensland and New South Wales as far south as Laurieton.

&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; has been introduced to many other continents and islands. It is an invasive species in the United States, but biological control by insects, including by a &quot;Selitrichodes&quot; wasp and Carposinidae and Gelechiidae moths, has been effective. It is also regarded as being invasive in South Africa.

==Ecology==
&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; is an actinorhizal plant able to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with strains of &quot;Frankia&quot;, a actinomycete hosted in nodules on its roots.

== Uses ==
Other than ornamental purposes, &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; was explored for its potential in remediation of textile dye wastewater. The leaves were found to be useful as absorbent material for the removal of textile dyes, such as reactive orange 16, Rhodamine B, methylene blue, malachite green and methyl violet 2b. Similarly, the dried cone was also reported to be able to remove Rhodamine B, and methyl violet 2b. The bark was reported to able to remove methylene blue. Even the seed was found to be useful in dye removal of neutral red and malachite green. The carbon derived from the cones of &quot;C. equisetifolia&quot; was found to be a good absorbent for landfill leachate, while another laboratory also reported good absorbency for copper ions from aqueous solution. Its line planting in coastal areas has been known to help control the wind force. In countries like India, it has been known as a suitable species for wasteland development.

== Culture ==
=== Names of places ===
In Singapore, there is a road named Tanjong Rhu Road because it once had many of these trees growing along the coast from Kallang to Rochor. In the island of Langkawi, Kedah, Malaysia, there is a sand spit in the mouth of the Ayer Hangat river in the Kilim Karst Geoforest Park about 20 km from the town of Kuah also named Tanjung Rhu, where a line of these trees may be seen. The town of Tanjung Aru in Sabah is so named because many specimens of this tree (&quot;aru&quot;) are found on its beach.

In the Philippines, the town of Agoo is named after the tree (known as &quot;agoho&quot; or &quot;aroo&quot; in the Ilocano language).

== Invasive species ==

&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; exhibits a high degree of adaptability to different environmental conditions, including coastal habitats, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. This versatility allows it to thrive in a wide range of ecosystems, increasing its potential for invasiveness.

The species produces large quantities of winged seeds contained within cone-like structures. These seeds are easily dispersed by wind and water, facilitating the rapid spread of &quot;C. equisetifolia&quot; over long distances. This dispersal mechanism enables it to colonize new areas and outcompete native species.

&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;&#x27;s lack of natural predators or pests contributes to its unchecked growth in many regions. While specific scientific references directly addressing this aspect might be limited, the absence of significant herbivory or predation on &quot;C. equisetifolia&quot; in non-native environments has been observed in ecological studies documenting its invasive behavior 

Human activities, such as urbanization, agriculture and landscaping, often contribute to the spread of &quot;C. equisetifolia&quot;. The species is frequently planted for erosion control, windbreaks, and ornamental purposes, inadvertently introducing it to new areas where it can become invasive.

<text>Francis Patrick Kenrick (December 3, 1796 or 1797 – July 8, 1863) was an Irish-born Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Philadelphia (1842–1851) and Archbishop of Baltimore (1851–1863).

Kenrick grew up in Ireland, where he received his early education. He then attended the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome, where he built a reputation as a theologian and scholar. After his ordination, he went to teach theology in the Diocese of Bardstown in the United States, where he became president of its seminary. Starting in 1830, Kenrick served as Coadjutor Bishop and later Bishop of Philadelphia, dealing with rebellious parish trustees and anti-Catholic riots in the city. He became Archbishop of Baltimore in 1851, serving there until his death in 1863.

Kenrick is known for his contributions to the American Catholic Church as a theologian and canon law scholar as well as for his introducing free parochial schools in the Diocese of Philadelphia and the Archdiocese of Baltimore.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Francis Kenrick was born in Dublin, Ireland, to Thomas and Jane (née Eustace) Kenrick. His younger brother, Peter Kenrick, became the first archbishop of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. The brothers&#x27; uncle, pastor of St. Nicholas of Myra Parish in Dublin, took an active role in their education. Francis Kenrick decided as a boy that he wanted to enter the priesthood. He attended elementary school and a so-called classical school in Dublin, where he achieved a strong academic record.

At age 18, Kenrick was selected to study at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome, where he became a distinguished student in theology. He was ordained to the priesthood in Rome by Archbishop Candido Maria Frattini on April 7, 1821.

===Ordination and ministry===
Shortly after Kenrick&#x27;s ordination, Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget of the Diocese of Bardstown in the United States sent a request to the Vatican for young priests to staff St. Thomas Seminary in Bardstown, Kentucky. Then one of the youngest priests at the university, Kenrick volunteered for the assignment.

Once in Bardstown, Kenrick taught theology at St. Thomas for the next nine years. He also taught Greek and history at St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Bardstown. He also engaged in missionary work in the diocese and held public debates on religion with Protestant ministers. He earned a reputation as an eloquent preacher and effective apologist, and was a recognized theologian and scripture scholar.

Flaget soon appointed Kenrick as his private secretary. When Flaget traveled to the First Provincial Council of Baltimore in 1829 in Baltimore, Maryland, Kenrick came along as his personal theologian. Kenrick also served as an assistant secretary at the provincial council.

===Bishop of Philadelphia===
On February 25, 1830, Pope Pius VIII appointed Kenrick coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Philadelphia, and titular bishop of &quot;Arath&quot; to assist the ailing Bishops Henry Conwell. Kenrick received his episcopal consecration on June 6, 1830, from Flaget, with Conwell and Bishop John serving as co-consecrators, in Bardstown.

==== Trustee controversies ====
Kenrick immediately assumed full administrative control of the diocese, which had been in turmoil from a schism at St. Mary&#x27;s Parish in Philadelphia. The parish trustees had rebelled against Conwell, who had removed their pastor due to his personal lifestyle. As bishop, Kenrick wanted to establish St. Mary&#x27;s as his episcopal see, with himself as pastor. The trustees refused. In response, Kenrick placed St. Mary&#x27;s under interdict. In a dramatic move, he celebrated mass at St. Mary&#x27;s the next Sunday and exposed the machinations of the trustees to the congregation. After losing support in the parish, the trustees in May 1831 sent a letter to Kenrick, pledging their obedience.

Kenrick faced a similar trustee dispute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, then part of the Diocese of Philadelphia, over the ownership of St. Paul&#x27;s Church. When the trustees told him that they built the church and it belonged to them, Kenrick replied:The church is yours. You have a perfect right to do what you please with it. I claim no right to interfere with any appropriation of it you wish to make. You may make of it, if you will, a factory, and I will not interfere. But there is one thing which I do tell you, and it is this: if you wish it to be a Catholic Church you must comply with the requirement of the law, which I have laid before you. Now do as you please.To forestall future trustee conflicts with other parishes, Kenrick obtained passage of a law transferring church property from parish trustees to the bishop of Philadelphia.

==== Growth of diocese ====
In June 1832, Kenrick founded St. Charles Borromeo Seminary for the preparation of seminarians, locating it at his personal residence in Philadelphia. The next month, cholera broke out in the city. The administrator of Blockley Almshouse, a homeless shelter and hospital in the city, asked Kenrick if the Sisters of Charity in Emmitsburg, Maryland, could send nurses to help. Reverend Michael Hurley, pastor of St. Augustine&#x27;s Parish in Philadelphia, converted his church into a temporary hospital. After the epidemic passed in September 1832, Philadelphia Mayor John Swift praised Kenrick for his assistance.

With the strong growth of the Catholic population in Western Pennsylvania, Kenrick petitioned the Vatican to create a new diocese there in 1835. The Vatican was leaning toward creating the new diocese and also appointing Kerick as coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of New York. When Kenrick expressed his opposition to the appointment, the Vatican dropped the coadjutor issue, along with that of the new diocese. The Vatican finally erected the Diocese of Pittsburgh on August 11, 1843.

==== Bible Riots ====
As the Irish Catholic population rose in Philadelphia during the early 1840s, Protestant Scotch-Irish workers in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia started worrying about losing jobs and housing. On November 10, 1842, Kenrick wrote to the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking the Philadelphia school system to allow Catholic children use the Catholic Douay Bible in class instead of a Protestant bible. He also asked that teachers excuse these children from non-Catholic religious teachings. As a result, the Board ordered that the schools make all religious activities optional and allow children to read whichever Bible was approved by their parents. However, nativist groups twisted these policy changes into misinformation to stir up their followers against the Irish.

On May 7, 1844, the American Republican Party, a nativist group, stage a rally near Kensington that triggered three days of rioting and bloodshed in the city. During the riot, nativist mobs burned St. Michael&#x27;s and Saint Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Churches. The theological library and rectory at St. Augustine&#x27;s were also lost. The state militia quelled the disturbances on May 8. The riots reignited on July 6, 1844, lasting for two days

Throughout the violence, Kenrick encouraged Catholics &quot;to follow peace and have charity.&quot; He closed all Catholic churches in Philadelphia and suspended the celebration of mass there. He encouraged his priests to avoid wearing clerical clothing when on the streets. Following the Bible riots, Kenrick realized that Catholic children needed to attend schools run by the church. He then initiated a parochial school system in Philadelphia to be administered by the archdiocese.

Between 1830 and 1850, the number of churches in the diocese grew from 22 to 92; priests from 35 to 101; charitable institutions from two to six; and the Catholic population from 35,000 to 170,000. In 1849, he purchased a farm in West Philadelphia for construction of Cathedral Cemetery. He also began construction on the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul and oversaw the rebuilding of St. Michael and St. Augustine following the Bible riots.

===Archbishop of Baltimore===
Following the death of Archbishop Samuel Eccleston on April 22, 1851, Pope Pius IX named Kenrick as archbishop of Baltimore on August 19, 1851. His installation took place in Baltimore on October 9, 1851. He presided over the First Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1852. As archbishop, Kenrick introduced free parochial schools in the archdiocese for all students, supported directly by the parishes.

In 1854, Pius IX invited Kenrick to attend the promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in Rome. In 1858, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, with the approval of Pius IX, conferred a &quot;prerogative of place&quot; on the archbishop of Baltimore. This meant that the archbishop of Baltimore had precedence over all other American archbishops and bishops, regardless of seniority in promotion or ordination.

With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1860, Kenrick told his priests to avoid all involvement in politics during the conflict, a position that he took also.

===Death and legacy===
Kenrick died at age 66 in Baltimore on July 8, 1863. According to reports, he was greatly distressed while reading earlier in the day about the carnage from the Battle of Gettysburg, which had taken place earlier that week in nearby Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Kenrick is interred in the crypt of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore.

Bishop Kenrick High School, opened in 1955 in Norristown, Pennsylvania, was named in honor of Francis Kenrick. It was succeeded in 1993 by Kennedy-Kenrick High School.

<text>In numerical analysis, Richardson extrapolation is a sequence acceleration method used to improve the rate of convergence of a sequence of estimates of some value formula_1. In essence, given the value of formula_2 for several values of formula_3, we can estimate formula_4 by extrapolating the estimates to formula_5. It is named after Lewis Fry Richardson, who introduced the technique in the early 20th century, though the idea was already known to Christiaan Huygens in his calculation of formula_6. In the words of Birkhoff and Rota, &quot;its usefulness for practical computations can hardly be overestimated.&quot; 

Practical applications of Richardson extrapolation include Romberg integration, which applies Richardson extrapolation to the trapezoid rule, and the Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations.

==General formula==

=== Notation ===
Let formula_7 be an approximation of &quot;formula_8&quot;(exact value) that depends on a step size (where formula_9) with an error formula of the form 
formula_10
where the formula_11 are unknown constants and the formula_12 are known constants such that formula_13. Furthermore, formula_14 represents the truncation error of the formula_15 approximation such that formula_16 Similarly, in formula_17 the approximation formula_15 is said to be an formula_14 approximation.

Note that by simplifying with Big O notation, the following formulae are equivalent:
formula_20

=== Purpose ===
Richardson extrapolation is a process that finds a better approximation of formula_8 by changing the error formula from formula_22 to formula_23 Therefore, by replacing formula_7 with formula_25 the truncation error has reduced from formula_26 to formula_27 for the same step size formula_3. The general pattern occurs in which formula_15 is a more accurate estimate than formula_30 when formula_31. By this process, we have achieved a better approximation of formula_8 by subtracting the largest term in the error which was formula_26. This process can be repeated to remove more error terms to get even better approximations.

=== Process ===
Using the step sizes formula_3 and formula_35 for some constant formula_36, the two formulas for formula_8 are:

To improve our approximation from formula_38 to formula_39 by removing the first error term, we multiply by formula_40 and subtract to give us
formula_41
This multiplication and subtraction was performed because formula_42 is an formula_39 approximation of formula_44. We can solve our current formula for formula_8 to give
formula_46
which can be written as formula_47 by setting
formula_48

=== Recurrence relation ===
A general recurrence relation can be defined for the approximations by
formula_49
where formula_50 satisfies
formula_51

=== Properties ===
The Richardson extrapolation can be considered as a linear sequence transformation.

Additionally, the general formula can be used to estimate formula_52 (leading order step size behavior of Truncation error) when neither its value nor formula_8 is known &quot;a priori&quot;. Such a technique can be useful for quantifying an unknown rate of convergence. Given approximations of formula_8 from three distinct step sizes formula_3, formula_35, and formula_57, the exact relationshipformula_58yields an approximate relationship (please note that the notation here may cause a bit of confusion, the two O appearing in the equation above only indicates the leading order step size behavior but their explicit forms are different and hence cancelling out of the two terms is only approximately valid)
formula_59
which can be solved numerically to estimate formula_52 for some arbitrary valid choices of formula_3, formula_62, and formula_36.

As formula_64, if formula_65 and formula_62 is chosen so that formula_67, this approximate relation reduces to a quadratic equation in formula_40, which is readily solved for formula_52 in terms of formula_3 and formula_36.

==Example of Richardson extrapolation==
Suppose that we wish to approximate formula_8, and we have a method formula_2 that depends on a small parameter formula_3 in such a way that
formula_75

Let us define a new functionformula_76where formula_3 and formula_78 are two distinct step sizes.

Then
formula_79
formula_80 is called the Richardson extrapolation of &quot;A&quot;(&quot;h&quot;), and has a higher-order error estimate formula_81 compared to formula_82.

Very often, it is much easier to obtain a given precision by using &quot;R&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) rather than &quot;A&quot;(&quot;h′&quot;) with a much smaller &quot;h′&quot;. Where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;h′&quot;) can cause problems due to limited precision (rounding errors) and/or due to the increasing number of calculations needed (see examples below).

==Example pseudocode for Richardson extrapolation==

The following pseudocode in MATLAB style demonstrates Richardson extrapolation to help solve the ODE formula_83, formula_84 with the Trapezoidal method. In this example we halve the step size formula_3 each iteration and so in the discussion above we&#x27;d have that formula_86. The error of the Trapezoidal method can be expressed in terms of odd powers so that the error over multiple steps can be expressed in even powers; this leads us to raise formula_36 to the second power and to take powers of formula_88 in the pseudocode. We want to find the value of formula_89, which has the exact solution of formula_90 since the exact solution of the ODE is formula_91. This pseudocode assumes that a function called codice_1 exists which attempts to compute codice_2 by performing the trapezoidal method on the function codice_3, with starting point codice_4 and codice_5 and step size codice_6.

Note that starting with too small an initial step size can potentially introduce error into the final solution. Although there are methods designed to help pick the best initial step size, one option is to start with a large step size and then to allow the Richardson extrapolation to reduce the step size each iteration until the error reaches the desired tolerance.
tStart = 0 % Starting time
tEnd = 5 % Ending time
f = -y^2 % The derivative of y, so y&#x27; = f(t, y(t)) = -y^2
 % The solution to this ODE is y = 1/(1 + t)
y0 = 1 % The initial position (i.e. y0 = y(tStart) = y(0) = 1)
tolerance = 10^-11 % 10 digit accuracy is desired

% Don&#x27;t allow the iteration to continue indefinitely
maxRows = 20
% Pick an initial step size
initialH = tStart - tEnd
% Were we able to find the solution to within the desired tolerance? not yet.
haveWeFoundSolution = false

h = initialH

% Create a 2D matrix of size maxRows by maxRows to hold the Richardson extrapolates
% Note that this will be a lower triangular matrix and that at most two rows are actually
% needed at any time in the computation.
A = zeroMatrix(maxRows, maxRows)

% Compute the top left element of the matrix.
% The first row of this (lower triangular) matrix has now been filled.
A(1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)

% Each row of the matrix requires one call to Trapezoidal
% This loops starts by filling the second row of the matrix,
% since the first row was computed above
for i = 1 : maxRows - 1 % Starting at i = 1, iterate at most maxRows - 1 times
 % Halve the previous value of h since this is the start of a new row.
 h = h/2

 % Starting filling row i+1 from the left by calling
 % the Trapezoidal function with this new smaller step size
 A(i + 1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)

 % Go across this current (i+1)-th row until the diagonal is reached
 for j = 1 : i
 % To compute A(i + 1, j + 1), which is the next Richardson extrapolate, 
 % use the most recently computed value (i.e. A(i + 1, j))
 % and the value from the row above it (i.e. A(i, j)).

 A(i + 1, j + 1) = ((4^j).*A(i + 1, j) - A(i, j))/(4^j - 1);
 end
 % After leaving the above inner loop, the diagonal element of row i + 1 has been computed
 % This diagonal element is the latest Richardson extrapolate to be computed.
 % The difference between this extrapolate and the last extrapolate of row i is a good
 % indication of the error.
 if (absoluteValue(A(i + 1, i + 1) - A(i, i)) &lt; tolerance) % If the result is within tolerance
 % Display the result of the Richardson extrapolation
 print(&quot;y = &quot;, A(i + 1, i + 1))
 haveWeFoundSolution = true
 % Done, so leave the loop
 break
 end
end

% If we were not able to find a solution to within the desired tolerance
if (not haveWeFoundSolution)
 print(&quot;Warning: Not able to find solution to within the desired tolerance of &quot;, tolerance);
 print(&quot;The last computed extrapolate was &quot;, A(maxRows, maxRows))

<text>The Central League is a football league for reserve teams, primarily from the English Football League. For sponsorship purposes, it was branded as the Final Third Development League until the 2015/16 season.

The league was formed in 1911 and in its early years consisted of a mix of first teams and reserve teams from the North and the Midlands. However, when the Football League Third Division North was created in 1921, all the first teams in the Central League became founder members.

Since then, the league has been for reserve teams only, and eventually expanded to include virtually every professional team in the South, Midlands and North of England. Southern teams used to play in the Football Combination. In recent years, the Premier Reserve League was created for reserve sides of Premier League teams, and so the Central League&#x27;s membership has been reduced.

From the 2006/07 season the FA Premier Reserve League was restricted to the reserve sides of FA Premier League clubs. This meant that the reserve sides of Championship clubs rejoined the Central League.

Teams are not promoted to the Premier Reserve League based on their final league position, but on the league position of their respective clubs&#x27; senior teams. If the senior team is promoted to the Premier League, then the reserve team is promoted to the Premier Reserve League and replaced by the reserve teams of the relegated clubs.

It was announced on 31 December 2013 that the Central League secured a sponsorship arrangement with Final Third Sports Media, and was known as the &#x27;Final Third Development League&#x27; with immediate effect for two seasons.

On 11 June 2014, it was announced that the league would expand to become a national competition by running a division in the south of the country for the 2014/15 season for the first time. The 2021–22 season was Northern only again, and only featured six teams, though the Central League Cup remained national. Wrexham joined for the 2022–23 season, despite not being in the EFL. Twelve teams entered in 2023–24, with them split into two leagues of six.

==Champions==
===1911–2024===
+ - Three divisions, overall winner decided after a series of play-offs.
^ - Three divisions, overall winner is the team with the best points per game ratio.
~ - Two divisions, overall winner is the team with the best points per game ratio.
* - Four divisions, overall winner is the team with the best points per game ratio.

<text>Alfredo José Pedrique García (, born August 11, 1960) is a Venezuelan professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop for the New York Mets (1987), Pittsburgh Pirates (1987–88), and Detroit Tigers (1989).

Pedrique served as the Houston Astros bench coach and as manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He also served as the first base coach of the Oakland Athletics a season before being shuffled to third base coaching for two further seasons.

He is currently the manager for the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils.

==Playing career==
Pedrique was signed by the New York Mets in 1978 and made his MLB debut nine years later. After five games with the 1987 Mets team he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates where he hit .301 in his rookie season but only managed a .188 cumulative batting average after that.

Pedrique was a career .247 hitter with one home run, 36 runs batted in (RBI), 32 runs, 18 doubles, one triple, and five stolen bases in 174 games.

==Managerial and coaching career==

After retiring, Pedrique managed in the minors for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Houston Astros, and Kansas City Royals organizations from 2000 to 2002. He came back to the majors in 2003 as a third base coach for the Diamondbacks. In 2004, Pedrique began the season as manager of the Tucson Sidewinders, the Diamondbacks Triple-A affiliate, but was hired as manager of the Diamondbacks on an interim basis when Bob Brenly was fired in July. Pedrique compiled a 22–61 record. He was replaced by Wally Backman, and then Bob Melvin, at the end of the season.

Pedrique created some controversy as manager when he ordered the Diamondbacks pitching staff to intentionally walk Barry Bonds throughout an entire three-game series against the San Francisco Giants from September 10–12, since Bonds was on the verge of hitting his 700th career home run, which Pedrique did not want to happen at Bank One Ballpark (in total for the series, Bonds was walked eight times (twice intentionally) while hitting one home run, and Bonds would hit his 700th on September 17th). Tom Verducci of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called the incident one of &quot;professional cowardice.&quot;

While serving as a special assistant for the Houston Astros in 2007, Pedrique was in Venezuela and championed a 16-year old Jose Altuve to the front office, convincing them that he had the talent and strength to eventually play in the major leagues. Altuve had been dismissed by scouts as being too short and thought he was lying about his age.

The Astros hired Pedrique as their bench coach on October 31, 2009, after previously serving as their Minor League Field Coordinator and third base coach. In 2013, he was hired as manager of the Yankees&#x27; Single-A affiliate Charleston RiverDogs. In 2014, the New York Yankees promoted Pedrique to the manager of the Tampa Yankees. In 2015, he was promoted to manager of the Trenton Thunder. On January 6, 2016, Pedrique was announced as the manager of the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. In his first season as manager, he led the RailRiders to a North Division title. Pedrique then led the RailRiders to the International League&#x27;s Governors&#x27; Cup championship and won. After that, he then led the RailRiders to win Triple-A National Championship Game and won that as well. In his second and final season as RailRiders manager, Pedrique led the RailRiders to a North Division title once again. The RailRiders ended up losing to the Durham Bulls, who went on to win the Triple A National Championship at the RailRiders PNC Field, in the Governors&#x27; Cup Championship.

On December 4, 2017, Pedrique was hired by the Oakland A&#x27;s as first base coach. He then shifted to third base after one season. He was let go after the 2020 season.

On March 29, 2021, he was named as the new manager for the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, the Triple-A affiliate for the Miami Marlins. On November 17, 2021, the Marlins hired Pedrique as their third base and infield coach for the 2022 season.

Pedrique was named manager of the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils for the 2023 season.

<doc id="650075" wikidata="Q3896802" url="?curid=650075" title="Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party">
<text>The Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party (VUPP), informally known as Ulster Vanguard, was a unionist political party which existed in Northern Ireland between 1972 and 1978. Led by William Craig, the party emerged from a split in the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and was closely affiliated with several loyalist paramilitary groups. The party was set up in opposition to compulsory power sharing with Irish nationalist parties. It opposed the Sunningdale Agreement and was involved in extra-parliamentary activity against the agreement. However, in 1975, during discussions on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in the constitutional convention, William Craig suggested the possibility of voluntary power sharing with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. In consequence the party split, with dissenters forming the United Ulster Unionist Party. Thereafter Vanguard declined and following poor results in the 1977 local government elections, Craig merged the remainder of Vanguard into the UUP in February 1978.

== Origins ==
It had its roots in the Vanguard or Ulster Vanguard wing of the Ulster Unionist Party who were opposed to the policies of the party&#x27;s leader, and last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Brian Faulkner. The Ulster Vanguard movement was originally a political pressure group within the UUP. It was formed on 9 February 1972 and was led by William Craig (former Minister of Home Affairs at Stormont) with its deputy leaders Rev Martin Smyth and the former Stormont MP for Carrick, Captain Austin Ardill. At its first meeting in Lisburn, on 13 February 1972, Craig made the first of a number of bellicose pronouncements, declaring, &quot;God help those who get in our way for we mean business.&quot;

After the suspension of the Stormont Parliament, Faulkner moved towards a policy of power-sharing with nationalist and non-sectarian politicians under the Sunningdale Agreement. In opposition to this many in the Ulster Unionists broke away and founded a separate Vanguard Party, with William Craig as the leader.

== Ideology ==
Vanguard is usually considered to have been a right-wing party. The presence of features such as an honour guard and a common salute led opponents to accuse it of being fascist. In its earliest days, it adopted the style associated with falangist parties with an honour guard, a common salute and a habit of wearing sashes. This led to it being characterised as Mosleyite or even neo-Nazi with the Stormont unionist MP William McConnell claiming that Vanguard rallies involved &quot;a certain Hitlerian-type figure ... walking up and down the lines, inspecting his so-called storm-troopers.&quot; Craig however denied that the party was either neo-nazi or paramilitary.

Ulster Vanguard was intended to provide an umbrella organisation for various loyalist groups.
It had close links with, and strong support from loyalist paramilitary groups. Vanguard had its own paramilitary grouping called the Vanguard Service Corps (USC), whose main function seemed to be to provide escorts for Vanguard speakers attending rallies.

== Policies ==
Vanguard strongly criticised the imposition of direct rule and in its booklet &#x27;Ulster – A Nation&#x27;, published in April 1972, it pledged &quot;resistance to an undemocratic and un-British regime&quot; and suggested the possibility of a federal British Isles.

At the Darlington Conference in September 1972, held to discuss various constitutional options for Northern Ireland, they proposed the restoration of the Northern Ireland Parliament as a single-chamber assembly with a committee system to ensure greater participation by all parties. Internal security responsibilities would be restored. However, there would be a bill of rights to safeguard the rights of minorities.

It demanded the &quot;extermination&quot; of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and a reversal of the reforms introduced by Brian Faulkner and his predecessor. In a booklet published in late 1972 entitled &#x27;Community of the British Isles&#x27;, it even flirted with the idea of full independence for Northern Ireland, albeit within a structure which would also include Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.

In late 1973 it rejected the idea of compulsory power-sharing with Irish Nationalists and consequently refused invitations to take part in the conferences which led to the Sunningdale Agreement.

In their 1974 Westminster manifesto, they called for the more mainstream Unionist option of either devolved government with full security responsibilities or full integration into the UK.

However, there were occasions when it did not follow the same course as other right-wing or unionist parties. For example, in the 1975 referendum on the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the-then European Economic Community, it campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain a member whilst the other Unionist parties campaigned for withdrawal.

=== Extra-Parliamentary activity ===
Vanguard was firmly supportive of extra-parliamentary activity in the form of direct action to achieve its goals. On 26 January 1972, Craig announced plans to hold large rallies in major centres in Northern Ireland. The culmination was a large rally on 18 March 1972 in Belfast&#x27;s Ormeau Park, attended by up to 60,000 people, at which Craig said, &quot;We must build up the dossiers on the men and women who are a menace to this country, because one day, ladies and gentlemen, if the politicians fail, it will be our duty to liquidate the enemy.&quot;

Following the suspension of Stormont and the imposition of direct rule in March 1972, Vanguard organised a general strike which lasted from 27 to 29 March. It affected power supplies, caused businesses to close and halted public transport. About 190,000 people participated and Vanguard members barricaded and took effective control of the town of Portadown. Later 100,000 unionists converged on the drive leading to Stormont, where Craig addressed the crowds, but deferred to the outgoing Prime Minister Brian Faulkner, who managed to disperse the crowds.
On 3 June 1972, VUPP organised a march in Derry against the creation of no-go areas in nationalist districts, which ended in violence on the city&#x27;s Craigavon Bridge. Despite the violence, Craig pledged to continue the marches stating: &quot;We are no longer protesting – we are demanding action.&quot;

In February 1973 it was one of the only parties to support the two-day general strike organised by the Loyalist Association of Workers in protest at the internment of Protestants. The strike had the further stated goal to &quot;re-establish some kind of Protestant or loyalist control over the affairs in the province, especially over security policy&quot; The strike resulted in high levels of violence with five people, including a fireman, being killed, seven people wounded, several explosions and numerous malicious fires.
The strike proved to be a forerunner of the Ulster Workers Council Strike the following year, in which VUPP again played a prominent role, making their headquarters in Hawthornden Road, Belfast, available to the strike leaders. with Craig a leading member of the UWC co-ordinating committee

In addition to large rallies, Vanguard used other tactics to try to put pressure on the British Government. In July 1972, they called for a rent and rate strike, a proposal which put them at odds with other unionist parties and which was criticised by the DUP. Several months later, on 19 October 1972, Craig addressed a meeting of the right wing Conservative Monday Club during which he claimed he could mobilise 80,000 men &quot;who are prepared to come out and shoot and kill.&quot;

== Electoral performances ==
The party contested a succession of elections: to the brief Sunningdale Assembly, the February 1974 General Election, the October 1974 General Election and the 1975 elections to the Constitutional Convention. The 1973 Sunningdale and local council elections were fought in an informal alliance with the DUP as &quot;the loyalist coalition&quot; while the latter three were fought as part of the United Ulster Unionist Council, a more formal arrangement, with the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionists, where the anti-Sunningdale wing of the party was now in control.

During the 1973–75 period VUPP was able to match or even beat the DUP in several elections. However, their prospect of replacing the DUP as the second party of Unionism ended as a result of events during the Constitutional Convention.

=== October 1974 UK general election ===
== Split ==
The Constitutional Convention was intended to serve as a forum to allow the politicians of Northern Ireland to draw up their own proposals for the political future of the province, though this proved unsuccessful. However, it led to William Craig proposing a voluntary coalition with the nationalist SDLP in the event of there being a state of emergency. The move was a considerable surprise, with a confidential government memo commenting: &quot;Mr. Craig appears to some as a knight in shining armour. The fact is that his aims were – and still are – simple: to get a devolved government which would control security policy as quickly as possible, on the basis of a gentleman&#x27;s agreement that the SDLP would participate in government for a year or two.&quot; But any idea of power sharing was anathema to many Unionist in the post-Sunningdale climate of 1975. Indeed, in January 1976, Deputy leader Ernest Baird warned that &quot;If Westminster does not accept the Protestants&#x27; rejection of power-sharing, it must face the inevitable consequences of a final conflict.&quot;

As a result, the party was split with only David Trimble and Glenn Barr backing Craig and the other eleven convention members challenging Craig&#x27;s leadership. Craig however claimed that he had the backing of the party&#x27;s rank and file and this was confirmed when sixty percent of party members backed him at a specially convened meeting. The dissidents then broke away to form what would later become the United Ulster Unionist Party.

On 8 September 1975, Craig&#x27;s proposals were decisively rejected at a meeting of the UUUC with 37 votes against and only Craig voting in favour. Consequently, Craig and the rump of VUPP were expelled from the UUUC.

== Decline and disbandment ==
The 1977 local elections were overshadowed by the abortive United Unionist Action Council (UUAC) Strike, which was mainly supported by the DUP and the UUUM. In contrast to 1974, when they had played a prominent role in the previous strike Vanguard criticised the strike and together with the UUP and Orange Order, called for it to be abandoned.

The 1977 council elections were seen as a crucial test of Vanguard&#x27;s ability to survive as a party and ultimately the party failed that test. Although thirteen councillors elected in 1973 stood as VUPP candidates, the party emerged from the election with only five councillors compared to twelve councillors elected in 1977 for their breakaway rival, the UUUP.

Craig then applied to rejoin the UUP in February 1978 and subsequently merged the remainder of Vanguard back into the Ulster Unionist Party, where it returned to its origins as a pressure group within the UUP as the Vanguard movement, although this too seems to have quickly faded away. The Democratic Unionist Party subsequently became the main Unionist party offering a more right wing alternative position to the Ulster Unionists.
In the 1982 elections for the new Northern Ireland Assembly, Craig, who had once more left the Ulster Unionists after losing his seat at Westminster, revived the name Vanguard for his candidacy in East Belfast. However he failed to get elected. Craig&#x27;s revived Vanguard was reportedly still in existence at the time of signing of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.

== Prominent UUP members in Vanguard ==
Several prominent current Ulster Unionist politicians were members of Vanguard, including future UUP MP David Burnside (who was Vanguard&#x27;s press officer from 1974 to 1977) while those elected for VUPP in 1975 included future UUP leaders David Trimble (who briefly served as Vanguard Deputy Leader) and Reg Empey, who served as Vanguard chairman from 1974 to 1975. Former deputy speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Jim Wilson, served as a Vanguard councillor on Newtownabbey Borough Council from 1975 to 1976 before joining the UUP Rev. Martin Smyth, later a UUP MP and Grand Master of the Orange Order, was deputy leader of the Vanguard movement but declined to join the party.

== Notes ==
# After 1973, the office of Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was abolished. When devolution was restored in 1998, the offices of First Minister and deputy First Minister were created instead.

* The number of Vanguard councillors elected in 1973 is a matter of some dispute among the various sources, as Whyte notes: &quot;There is huge potential for confusion among the various candidate designations.&quot; As a minimum, James Knight, writing closest to the time, counted eight councillors. CAIN counts nine Vanguard councillors, counting an additional councillor in Ards. Whyte counts ten, ignoring the councillor in Ards but counting two additional councillors in Craigavon who he says were described as Vanguard councillors on the ballot paper.

However, in addition to the eleven above, a further thirteen councillors elected in 1973 (usually under a &#x27;loyalist&#x27; label) contested the 1977 local elections either for Vanguard or for their splinter party, the United Ulster Unionist Party. This includes seven councillors elected as loyalists in 1973 who ran as VUPP candidates in 1977, namely Seymour, Armstrong, Semple and Stewart (Larne); Green and Mary O&#x27;Fee (North Down); and Glenn Barr (Londonderry). A further four sitting councillors elected as Loyalists stood as UUUP candidates in 1977, namely McKeever (Larne), Ritchie (Carrickfergus), Scott (Castlereagh) and Parke (Cookstown). Ben Horan, elected as a &#x27;Unionist&#x27; in Belfast in 1973, announced two days after the election in the local press that he would sit as a VUPP councillor although he stood in 1977 as a UUUP candidate. Finally, Randall Crawford, elected in Coleraine in 1973 and 1977 as a non-party candidate, stood for Londonderry in the 1975 Constitutional convention election as a VUPP candidate.

A further councillor, Mrs M. Corrie, elected in Castlereagh as a United Loyalist, is described in contemporary press reports as a Vanguard councillor, but did not contest the 1977 local elections.

<text>Loch Lubnaig () is a small freshwater loch near Callander in the Stirling council area, Scottish Highlands. It lies in the former county of Perthshire. It is part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.

The loch nestles in the space between Ben Ledi and Ben Vorlich. Fed by the River Balvaig from the north and drained by the Garbh Uisge to the south, Loch Lubnaig offers fishing from the shore while canoes can be rented at the north end. Alternatively, two car parking areas on the east shore offer canoe launching points.

The route of the former Callander and Oban Railway runs along the west shore of the loch. This route has now been converted to a part of the National Cycle Network&#x27;s &quot;Route 7&quot; allowing cyclists and walkers to travel the between Callander and Strathyre.

The name is derived from the Gaelic Lùbnaig, meaning &quot;crooked&quot;. Like many lochs of the Highlands, the name is almost identical to its Gaelic version.

==Bathymetrical survey==

Loch Lubnaig is different from the other lochs in its neighbourhood in that it does not constitute a single basin. The bottom is irregular, the contour lines of depth do not follow the contour of the loch. Hollows and ridges alternate with each other and in some places, deep water is found close to the shore, while in other places shallow water extends a considerable distance from the shore. The loch is narrow and shallow considering its size, comparatively speaking, nearly two-thirds of the area being under in depth. The loch may be considered into two halves, defined by the central constriction in the outline of the loch at the entrance of the Ardchillarie burn, where the bottom shallows and separates two principal deep depressions. The northern half trends in a north-west and south-east direction, while the southern half trends almost directly north and south.

There are two depressions in which the depth exceeds , with an isolated sounding of between them. The larger depression is contained in the southern half of the loch, and is over in length with a maximum width of about . The smaller but deeper depression is situated at the base of the northern half of the loch, occupying a central position and is over in length with a width of . The deepest part of the loch at is centrally located in the depression. There are three other smaller depressions.

On the western shore, between from the southern end of the loch, there is a sandy spit, which stretches out towards the centre of the loch.

<doc id="650079" wikidata="Q2120872" url="?curid=650079" title="Blue-lined octopus">
<text>The blue-lined octopus (Hapalochlaena fasciata) is one of four species of highly venomous blue-ringed octopuses. It can be found in Pacific Ocean waters that stretch from Australia to Japan. It is most commonly found around intertidal rocky shores and coastal waters to a depth of 15 metres (49 ft) between southern Queensland and southern New South Wales. It is relatively small, with a mantle up to 45 millimetres (1.8 in) in length. In its relaxed state, it is a mottled yellow-brown with dark blue or black streaks covering the whole body apart from the underside of its arms, but its vibrant blue markings appear as a warning to predators when it feels threatened. Along with its other closely related species, the blue-lined octopus is regarded as one of the most dangerous animals in the sea, and its venom can be fatal to humans. This benthic octopus is one of four members of the genus &quot;Hapalochlaena&quot;, with the other species being the greater blue-ringed octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena lunulata),&quot; southern blue-ringed octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena maculosa),&quot; and the blue-ringed octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena nierstraszi)&quot;. The blue-lined octopus is the only species of the four to display lined iridescent blue marking, as opposed to circular iridescent blue marking that the three other species tend to exhibit.

== Behavior ==
Blue-lined octopuses tend to swim around shallow areas of coral reefs and tide pools. They often hide in crevices of reefs, empty seashells, and other ocean resources they can find to conceal their identity. Blue-lined octopuses are known to be nocturnal hunters, while other species in the genus such as the greater blue-ringed octopus (&quot;H. Lunulata)&quot; is known to be diurnal hunter. Prey for blue-lined octopuses mostly consists of crustaceans and stomatopods, however in captivity they have been recorded to eat live fish, suggesting they do in the wild as well. They do not use their venom (known as tetrodotoxin) to kill their prey, but instead trap it inside their arms and pierce them with its parrot-like beak.

== Features ==
The blue-lined octopus is about the size of a golf ball, having a mantle length of 45mm, it is the smallest out of the four species that make up the genus. While at rest blue-lined octopus are highly camouflaged, due to the presence of chromatophores under the skin they can rapidly change body coloration, using aposematic signals to display bright blue lines to predators. When it is resting, Its passive colors range from a light grey to beige. The visceral hump in blue-lined octopus is regularly pointed. When looking at blue-lined octopus they portray sexual dimorphism, along with this females tend to weigh more than males.

== Lethality ==
Blue-lined octopuses can be very lethal to humans. Their saliva contain a special neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin. However, the species is more likely to flee and find shelter in an encounter due to their extremely shy nature. Nonetheless, there have been at least three reported human deaths from the blue-lined octopus. It poses most danger to those who pick up the octopus and physically touch it.

If a human is bitten by the octopus, the bite may not be felt at first due to the small injection apparatus of the octopus. After some time, symptoms of the injection include loss of feeling in the tongue/lips, muscle weakness/paralyzation, respiratory failure, unconsciousness, and eventually death. The tetrodotoxin in blue-lined octopuses is so lethal that it has been estimated that the venom from a single 25-gram octopus can kill about ten 75-kilogram humans.

This tetrodotoxin known as TTX has been located in the posterior salivatory gland, anterior salvatory gland, arm, mantle, digestive glands, testes, brachial heart, nephridia, gill, and oviducal gland in blue-lined octopuses. With TTX being located in the brachial heart, nephridia, and gills it suggests that there is a transport mechanism for TTX in the blood. TTX is known to be one of the most powerful marine biotoxins to humans, this is only released through a bite, or ingestion. Furthermore &quot;Hapalochlaena&quot; is the only genus to produce this biotoxin, which is thought to have played an important role in the evolution of the species.

== Reproduction ==
The blue-lined octopuses start reproducing at a year old. During breeding male blue-lined octopus will seek and mount females, they do not extend the hectocotylus and mate from a distance like other octopus species. If they are successful, the female octopus will lay 50 to 100 eggs 30 days after the encounter. During the 30 days, the female octopus hides her eggs under her arms and does not leave her hiding spot until the eggs hatch. After laying her eggs, the female octopus dies. These eggs are large and produce benthic hatchlings, development for these hatchlings takes about two months.

== Distribution ==
Blue-lined octopus are commonly found off the coast of Australia inhabiting shallow tropical and subtropical reef waters. However, in recent years they have been found to distribute throughout the Pacific Ocean. They have been recorded of the east coast of Japan, as well as off the coast of Jeju Island in Korea in 2015. This can suggest that the warming of ocean water has caused a shift in suitable habitat for these octopus, this shift is important to monitor as if can aid is public health and safety.

Leung was born in Dundee to Peter Leung, a Hong-Kong-born businessman and restaurateur who opened a company in Glasgow, and Kar Wai Li, a banker. Her parents divorced when she was three, and she continued living in Scotland with her father, stepmother, and siblings after her mother moved back to Hong Kong. Her father&#x27;s occupation led to Leung growing up in multiple towns, including Ayr, Hamilton, and Motherwell. She attended secondary school at Hamilton College.

==Career==
===2004–2011: &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and other early roles===
Leung&#x27;s father saw an advertisement for a &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; casting call, and suggested she should try out. She waited four hours in line for a five-minute audition, despite feeling she had little likelihood of obtaining the role. Two weeks later, she was called back for a workshop and was cast as Cho Chang, beating over 3,000 other girls for the part. She has stated that her Scottish accent probably gave her an advantage in the casting, as the casting director asked the girls who attended the audition, &quot;Is there anyone here from Scotland?&quot;, to which only Leung raised her hand.


In a 2011 interview, Leung recalled how her fondest memory of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; experience was the first audition, because both her parents, who were separated at the time, went with her: &quot;It was a really nice moment because my parents hadn&#x27;t seen each other for a long, long time.&quot; In an effort to heavily promote &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, Warner Bros. sent Leung to China in the film&#x27;s second week of release, in an atypical move towards a market that was not used to frequent celebrity visits at the time.

Leung reprised her role in the subsequent films in the series, most notably &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, in which her character had the distinction of being Harry Potter&#x27;s first romance. As a result, Leung and co-star Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) shared an on-screen kiss that received much media coverage. While Leung was greeted warmly by most of the fandom, other fans created hate websites in response to her casting and posted many racist messages which were upsetting to her at the time. In March 2021, Leung opened up further about the racist harassment she received from fans while filming &quot;Harry Potter&quot;; appearing on an episode of the &quot;Chinese Chippy Girl&quot; podcast, she revealed that she was told by her publicists to deny what was happening if any interviewer asked.

Leung was named Scotland&#x27;s most stylish female and the hottest Scotswoman in 2007 by &quot;The Scotsman&quot;. In July 2007, she was cast by Gold Label Records, a subsidiary of EMI in Hong Kong, to be the female lead in the music video &quot;Love Coming Home&quot; &quot;()&quot; by Leo Ku.

In her first role outside of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, Leung played Hsui Tai in the episode &quot;Cat Among the Pigeons&quot; of ITV1&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot,&quot; which premiered on 21 September 2008.

===2012–present: continued stage and screen roles===
Following the end of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, Leung was uncertain if she wanted to further pursue a career in acting but was inspired to continue after attending a drama course at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. In December 2011, she was awarded the role of Jung Chang as her stage debut role in Chang&#x27;s autobiographical play &quot;Wild Swans&quot;. In comparing film to live performances, Leung said, &quot;The obvious challenge is of course getting it right the first time, which is weirdly exciting for me.&quot; The play made its world premiere in Cambridge, Massachusetts in February 2012, before returning to Motherwell and concluding with an April–May run at the Young Vic in London.

In June 2012, it was confirmed that Leung would star in the Channel 4 four-part drama series &quot;Run&quot; as leading character Ying, an undocumented Chinese immigrant living in Brixton. In 2013, Leung starred alongside Vera Chok in &quot;The World of Extreme Happiness&quot;, a play about the world of migrant workers in China&#x27;s rapidly emerging modern era. In the production, staged at The Shed at the National Theatre, she played the role of Sunny, a female migrant worker.

In April 2014, it was announced that Leung was to play the lead role of Mei, a first-born Chinese girl adopted by an American mother and British father, in the TV miniseries &quot;One Child&quot;. In the story, her character is asked to return to her birthplace, Guangzhou, when her birth mother desperately seeks her assistance in saving her son. The series, a co-production of BBC Drama and Sundance TV, filmed in May 2014 in London and Hong Kong, aired on Sundance TV in December 2014, and was broadcast on BBC Two in February 2016. Leung received praise from Catherine Gee of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, who called her performance &quot;beautifully understated&quot;.

In late 2016, Leung appeared in the Tony Kushner play &quot;The Intelligent Homosexual&#x27;s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures&quot; (&quot;iHo&quot;) at the Hampstead Theatre in London. In 2017, she co-starred with Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan in &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, playing Fan, Chan&#x27;s character&#x27;s daughter. This was followed by a supporting role as Lau Chen in the ITV drama &quot;Strangers&quot;, also known by the title &quot;White Dragon&quot;.

Leung subsequently appeared in recurring roles as DC Blair Ferguson in the Alibi series &quot;Annika&quot;, the voice of Caitlyn in the Netflix series &quot;Arcane&quot;, and Ash in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;The Peripheral&quot;.

In January 2022, Leung&#x27;s essay &quot;Getting into Character&quot; was published in the book &quot;East Side Voices: Essays Celebrating East &amp; Southeast Asian Identity in Britain&quot;. In her essay, Leung wrote about how her ethnicity impacted her experiences growing up and her acting career.

In 2023, Leung starred in the first season of Paramount+&#x27;s series adaptation of Simon Beckett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Chemistry of Death&quot;. In 2024, she appeared in the BBC One miniseries &quot;Nightsleeper&quot;.

In September 2024, Leung joined the regular cast of &quot;Bridgerton&quot; as Lady Araminta Gun for its forthcoming fourth season.

==Charity-work==
In 2007, Leung helped The Prince&#x27;s Trust charity raise £100,000 by launching a children&#x27;s art competition, donating one of her own paintings that was auctioned for £960. In 2009, she donated a photo to Sightsavers International&#x27;s I:Click 2009 competition, with benefits going to treat and prevent blindness for residents of impoverished countries.

In 2018, Leung ran a 10K marathon for My Body Back, a charity that supports victims of sexual violence.

==Personal life==

Leung delayed plans to go to art college and university to film &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. During this period, Leung had said she was undecided about pursuing an acting-career after &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and wished to attend university to study art and design.

Leung briefly studied painting at University of the Arts London before completing a photography degree at Edinburgh College of Art. Following this, she attended the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, where she completed the BA in Acting course. 

On 19 August 2018, Leung participated in the wedding of her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; castmate, Afshan Azad.

On 1 January 2023, for New Year&#x27;s Day, Leung revealed on Instagram that her son had been born the previous Halloween. Her pregnancy was worked into the second series of &quot;Annika&quot;, which she filmed prior to giving birth.

Leung speaks fluent Cantonese and basic Mandarin. She is a vegetarian.

<doc id="650085" wikidata="Q2920081" url="?curid=650085" title="Viceroyalty of Brazil">
<text>The Viceroyalty of Brazil refers, in narrow scope, to office of viceroy of the Portuguese colonial State of Brazil and, in broad scope, to the whole State of Brazil during the historic period when its governors had the title of &quot;viceroy&quot;. The term &quot;viceroyalty&quot; however never officially designated the title of the colony, which continued to be designated &quot;state&quot;. Until 1763, the title &quot;Viceroy&quot; was occasionally granted to some governors of Brazil who were members of the high nobility, with the remaining keeping the title &quot;governor-general&quot;. From around 1763, the title &quot;viceroy&quot; became permanent, so being granted to all governors. The position of viceroy was abolished, when the Portuguese court transferred to Brazil in 1808, with the State of Brazil becoming directly administered by the Portuguese Government seated in Rio de Janeiro. 

==History==
Since the 17th century, the title of &quot;viceroy&quot; was granted occasionally to some governors of the State of Brazil, who were members of the Portuguese high nobility, with the first being D. Jorge Mascarenhas, marquis of Montalvão, who assumed the office in 26 May, 1640. The remaining, kept the title of &quot;governor-general&quot;.

Around 1763, at the same time that the capital of the State of Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro, the title &quot;viceroy&quot; became permanent and, since then, granted to all governors of the State. The driving force for the move was the then tiny village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, and its capital was made São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro as a result of the Emboabas&#x27; War against Portuguese recent arrivals and colonizers from Bahia, and the consequent shift of economic power to the gold-producing Minas dos Matos Gerais: São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro was the port where the gold was sent to Portugal, and consequently the point of contact between metropolis and colony.

In 1775, the remaining states of the Portuguese America (Maranhão and Grão-Pará) were integrated in the State of Brazil, becoming under the authority of its viceroy, the capital maintained in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1808, with the Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil, the Prince Regent (future John VI of Portugal) assumed direct control of the government of the State of Brazil, suppressing the office of viceroy. In 1815, the status of the State of Brazil was raised, becoming the Kingdom of Brazil, as one of the constituent kingdoms of the newly created United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
