<text>In popular music, a break is an instrumental or percussion section during a song derived from or related to stop-time – being a &quot;break&quot; from the main parts of the song or piece. A break is usually interpolated between sections of a song, to provide a sense of anticipation, signal the start of a new section, or create variety in the arrangement.

==Jazz==
A solo break in jazz occurs when the rhythm section (piano, bass, drums) stops playing behind a soloist for a brief period, usually two or four bars leading into the soloist&#x27;s first improvised solo chorus (at which point the rhythm section resumes playing). A notable recorded example is sax player Charlie Parker&#x27;s solo break at the beginning of his solo on &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;. While the solo break is a break for the rhythm section, for the soloist, it is a solo cadenza, where they are expected to improvise an interesting and engaging melodic line.

==DJing and dance music ==
In DJ parlance, in disco, hip hop and electronic dance music, a break is where all the elements of a song (e.g., synth pads, basslines, vocals), except for percussion, disappear; as such, the break is also called a &quot;percussion break&quot;.

This is distinguished from a breakdown, a section where the composition is deliberately deconstructed to minimal elements (usually the percussion or rhythm section with the vocal re-introduced over the minimal backing), all other parts having been gradually or suddenly cut out. The distinction between breaks and breakdowns may be described as, &quot;Breaks are for the drummer; breakdowns are for electronic producers&quot;. In hip hop music and electronica, a short break is also known as a &quot;cut&quot;, and the reintroduction of the full bass line and drums is known as a &quot;drop&quot;, which is sometimes accented by cutting off everything, even the percussion right before the full music is dropped back in.

==Hip hop==
Old-school hip-hop DJs have described the relationship between breaks, early hip-hop music, and disco. According to Afrika Bambaataa:
Musicologist David Toop, based on interviews with DJ Grandmaster Flash, Kool DJ Herc, and others, has written:
DJ Kool Herc&#x27;s innovative use of the break-beat came about through his observations of dancers and desire to give them what they wanted. In this case the who was b-boys (otherwise known as break-boys or breakdancers) and what they wanted was an opportunity to move explosively, express themselves, and peacock to women (Brester and Broughton 167).

==Break==
A break may be described as when the song takes a &quot;breather, drops down to some exciting percussion, and then comes storming back again&quot; and compared to a false ending. Breaks usually occur two-thirds to three-quarters of the way through a song. According to Peter van der Merwe a break &quot;occurs when the voice stops at the end of a phrase and is answered by a snatch of accompaniment&quot;, and originated from the bass runs of marches of the &quot;Sousa school&quot;. In this case it would be a &quot;break&quot; from the vocal part. In bluegrass and other old-time music, a break is &quot;when an instrument plays the melody to a song idiomatically, i.e. the back-up played on the banjo for a mandolin &#x27;break&#x27; may differ from that played for a dobro &#x27;break&#x27; in the same song&quot;.

According to David Toop, &quot;the word &quot;break&quot; or &quot;breaking&quot; is a music and dance term, as well as a proverb, that goes back a long way. Some tunes, like &#x27;Buck Dancer&#x27;s Lament&#x27; from early in the nineteenth century, featured a two-bar silence in every eight bars for the break—a quick showcase of improvised dance steps. Others used the same device for a solo instrumental break; a well-known example being the four-bar break taken by Charlie Parker in Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s tune &#x27;Night in Tunisia&#x27;.&quot;

However, in hip hop today, the term &quot;break&quot; refers to segment of music (usually four measures or less) that could be sampled and repeated. A break is any expanse of music that is by a producer. In the words of DJ Jazzy Jay: &quot;Maybe those records [whose breaks are sampled] were ahead of their time. Maybe they were made specifically for the rap era; these people didn&#x27;t know what they were making at that time. They thought, &#x27;Oh, we want to make a jazz record. Like the song Stereo World By Feeder and Upon This Rock by Newsboys are example that have a break and use this technique.

==Breakbeat (element of music)==

A break beat is the sampling of breaks as (drum loop) beats, (originally found in soul or funk tracks) and their subsequent use as the rhythmic basis for hip hop and rap. It was invented by DJ Kool Herc, a Jamaican who emigrated to New York. He is usually credited with being a pioneer of the technique of using two copies of one record so as to be able to mix between the same break, or, as Bronx DJ Afrika Bambaataa describes, &quot;that certain part of the record that everybody waits for—they just let their inner self go and get wild&quot;, extending its length through repetition. However, it is likely that there were a number of like-minded DJs developing the technique at the same time; for example, Walter Gibbons was noted in first-hand accounts by his peers for cutting two copies of the same record in his discothèque gigs of the mid-1970s.

A particularly innovative style of street dance was created to accompany break beat-based music, and was hence referred to as &quot;The Break&quot;, or breaking. In the 1980s, charismatic dancers like Crazy Legs, Frosty Freeze, and the Rock Steady Crew revived the breaking movement.

More recently, electronic artists have created &quot;break beats&quot; from other electronic music, resulting in a broad style classification itself called breakbeat. Hip-hop break beat compilations include &quot;Hardcore Break Beats&quot; and &quot;Break Beats&quot;, and &quot;Drum Drops&quot;. It was during the break beats of the song that break dancers and b-boys and girls would become the focus of attention and demonstrate their personal flair. DJ Kool Herc inspired local dancers to dance on the break beats, creating new sounds by combining the breakbeats from various songs.

==Notable examples==
Musical ensembles which are notable for their use of breaks include the Meters, Creative Source, the J.B.&#x27;s, the Blackbyrds, and the Last Poets.

Notable breaks include:
* The Amen break from &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; (1969) by the Winstons The Amen break is quite often used as a second-hand sample from &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; by N.W.A, which sampled the original.
* &quot;Apache&quot; by the Incredible Bongo Band, sampled from the intro. Used by DJ Kool Herc, the Sugarhill Gang in &quot;Apache&quot;, West Street Mob in &quot;Break Dancin&#x27; – Electric Boogie&quot;.
* &quot;Ashley&#x27;s Roachclip&quot; by Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers. Used by Eric B &amp; Rakim, PM Dawn, Milli Vanilli, LL Cool J and many others.
* &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; by James Brown, sampled roughly at 5:34. Used by Public Enemy, Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, Ice Cube, etc.
* &quot;Fencewalk&quot; by Mandrill, used by DJ Kool Herc
* &quot;Think (About It)&quot; by Lyn Collins
* &quot;The Bottle&quot; by Gil Scott-Heron
* &quot;Take Me to the Mardi Gras&quot; by Bob James, cover of Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Take Me to the Mardi Gras&quot;, sampled from the intro. Used by the Crash Crew on &quot;Breaking Bells (Take Me to the Mardi Gras)&quot; and by Run DMC on &quot;Peter Piper&quot;.
* &quot;Sesame Street&quot; by Blowfly, unique testimony of breakbeat science as the breakbeat is reconstructed from various places with solo drums in the song. Also known as &quot;Helicopter&quot; break after &quot;The Helicopter Tune&quot; by Deep Blue, which is the common second-hand source of the reconstructed sample.
* &quot;Scorpio&quot; by Dennis Coffey
* &quot;Scratchin by Magic Disco Machine
* &quot;Super Sporm&quot; by Captain Sky
* &quot;Move On Up&quot; by Curtis Mayfield

<text>East Coker is a village and civil parish in the South Somerset district of Somerset, England. Its nearest town is Yeovil, to the north. The village has a population of 1,667. The parish includes the hamlets and areas of North Coker, Burton, Holywell, Coker Marsh, Darvole, Nash, Keyford as well as the southern end of the Wraxhill area.

==History==

A Roman villa was discovered in East Coker in the 18th century and subsequent excavation has discovered artefacts including a mosaic; however, further work is needed to fully identify the plan of the building.

In the Domesday Survey of 1086 the villages of West and East Coker were known as &quot;Cocre&quot;.

The parish was part of the hundred of Houndsborough.

The Manor of East Coker was held by the Courtenay family of Powderham from 1306 until 1591. They built Coker Court as the manor house which was eventually sold to Edward Phelips, a wealthy landowner in the region. Upon Edward&#x27;s death, the manor was left to his trustee, William Helyar, whose family it descended into for the next 300 years. After the last Helyar heir died in the first half of the 20th century, the lordship was acquired by a descendant of the Courtenay family who is the current lord of the manor. 

In 1645, soon after the English Civil War, 70 people in the village died of the plague.

In 2011 South Somerset Council published a plan for local housing which included a proposal for the construction of 3,700 new houses on land between East Coker and Yeovil. Local opposition has been vocal. It included an application, supported by Andrew Motion, for World Heritage Site listing based on associations with T.S. Eliot, who wrote the poem &quot;East Coker&quot;, the second of his &quot;Four Quartets&quot; in 1940 after a visit to the village.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

==Landmarks==
Coker Court was built as a 15th-century manor house, and is now divided into several properties. The 18th-century portion was built by Sir William Chambers. It was used as Clare School at one time. It is listed Grade I.

Helyar Almshouses built between 1640 and 1660.

Hymerford House (also known as Grove Farmhouse) dates from the 15th century and is listed Grade I.

Naish Priory listed Grade I contains extant portions of a substantial and important establishment that was part of the manor of Coker and dates from the 14th century.

==Transport==
The parish has no railway station, the nearest being Yeovil Junction railway station on the Exeter-London Waterloo line which passes through the parish. Previously the village was served by Sutton Bingham Station which was about one kilometre south of the village and closed to all traffic on 31 December 1962. There are a few bus routes, these are Route N8 (Nippy Bus) West Coker-Yeovil which operates hourly Monday to Friday Daytime between 8am and 5pm Route X37 (Sureline) Yeovil-Dorchester operates one journey in this direction only Monday to Friday Yeovil College Term time Only at 0927 arriving at Dorchester at 1020 in combination with a return service Route 212 (Sureline) Dorchester-Yeovil operates one journey in this direction only Monday to Friday Yeovil College Term time Only leaving Dorchester at 1200 arriving back in East Coker at 1314. The parish also has some innovative demand responsive transport provided by Nippy Bus, the N8 can be booked to pick up passengers off route in the parish after first registering and calling the company an hour before travel and will arrange a convenient time within the hours of operation to pick people up. There is also a night bus service Route N4 Crewkerne-Yeovil which operates on a demand responsive basis Wednesday-Saturday Nights, last journey from Yeovil Thursday-Saturday Nights is at 0250 in the early hours of the morning arriving in the parish around 0330.

==Religious sites==

The church of St Michael in East Coker dates from the 12th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The church is the final resting place of the ashes of T. S. Eliot, whose ancestors came from the village.

==Notable residents==

==Notable trees==

A superb specimen of the narrow-leaved (or smooth-leaved) elm &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; subsp. &quot;minor&quot; survives, unscathed by Dutch elm disease, in a pasture to the south-east of the village. Measured in 2008, it was more than 30 m in height, with a d.b.h. of 85 cm. Almost certainly planted as one of many ornamentals by the Helyar dynasty, the tree is a TROBI UK Champion, and has been adjudged the finest freestanding specimen in Europe.

The tree has been cloned at Le Pépinière Forestière de L&#x27;etat, Guémené-Penfao, France, as part of the Euforgen genetic resources conservation programme.

<text>Constance Clara Garnett (; 19 December 1861 – 17 December 1946) was an English translator of nineteenth-century Russian literature. She was the first English translator to render numerous volumes of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s work into English and the first to translate almost all of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s fiction into English. She also rendered works by Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Goncharov, Alexander Ostrovsky, and Alexander Herzen into English. Altogether, she translated 71 volumes of Russian literature, many of which are still in print today.

==Life==
Garnett was born in Brighton, England, the sixth of the eight children of the solicitor David Black (1817–1892), afterwards town clerk and coroner, and his wife, Clara Maria Patten (1825–1875), daughter of painter George Patten. Her brother was the mathematician Arthur Black, and her sister was the labour organiser and novelist Clementina Black. Her father became paralysed in 1873, and two years later her mother died from a heart attack after lifting him from his chair to his bed.

She was initially educated at Brighton and Hove High School. Afterwards she studied Latin and Greek at Newnham College, Cambridge, on a government scholarship. In 1883 she moved to London, where she started work as a governess, and then as the librarian at the People&#x27;s Palace Library. Through her sister, Clementina, she met Dr. Richard Garnett, then the Keeper of Printed Materials at the British Museum, and his son Edward Garnett, whom she married in Brighton on 31 August 1889. Edward, after working as a publisher&#x27;s reader for T. Fisher Unwin, William Heinemann, and Duckworth, went on to become a reader for the publisher Jonathan Cape. In the summer of 1891, then pregnant with her only child, she was introduced by Edward to the Russian exile Feliks Volkhovsky, who began teaching her Russian. He also introduced her to his fellow exile and colleague Sergius Stepniak and his wife Fanny. Soon after, Garnett began working with Stepniak, translating Russian works for publication; her first published translations were &quot;A Common Story&quot; by Ivan Goncharov, and &quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You&quot; by Leo Tolstoy. The latter was published while she was making her first trip to Russia in early 1894. After visits to Moscow and Saint Petersburg, she travelled to Yasnaya Polyana where she met Tolstoy; although the latter expressed interest in having her translate more of his religious works, she had already begun working on the novels of Turgenev and continued with that on her return home. Initially she worked with Stepniak on her translations; after his untimely death in 1895, Stepniak&#x27;s wife Fanny worked with her. From 1906, her favourite amanuensis was a young Russian woman, Natalie Duddington whom she had met in Russia and in whom she found &quot;real intellectual companionship&quot;.

Over the next four decades, Garnett produced English-language versions of dozens of volumes by Tolstoy, Gogol, Goncharov, Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Ostrovsky, Herzen and Chekhov.

Her son and only child, David Garnett, trained as a biologist and later wrote novels, including the popular &quot;Lady into Fox&quot; (1922).

By the late 1920s, Garnett was frail and half-blind. She retired from translating after the publication in 1934 of &quot;Three Plays&quot; by Turgenev. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1937, she became reclusive. She developed a heart condition, with attendant breathlessness, and in her last years had to walk with crutches. She died at The Cearne, Crockham Hill, Kent, at the age of 84.

==Reception and legacy==
Constance Garnett translated 71 volumes of Russian literary works, and her translations received acclaim from numerous critics and authors, including Joseph Conrad and D. H. Lawrence. Ernest Hemingway admired her translations of Fyodor Dostoevsky and once told a friend that he was unable to read through Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; &quot;until I got the Constance Garnett translation.&quot; Despite some complaints about being outdated, her translations are still being reprinted today (most are now in the public domain).

However, Garnett also has had critics, notably Russian authors Vladimir Nabokov and Joseph Brodsky. Nabokov said that Garnett&#x27;s translations were &quot;dry and flat, and always unbearably demure.&quot; Commenting on a letter of Joseph Conrad to Edward Garnett, in which Conrad had written that &quot;[Constance&#x27;s] translation of Karenina is splendid. Of the thing itself [i.e. Anna Karenina] I think but little, so that her merit shines with the greater luster&quot;, Nabokov wrote &quot;I shall never forgive Conrad this crack. Actually the Garnett translation is very poor&quot;. (Nabokov&#x27;s criticism of Garnett, however, should be viewed in light of his publicly stated ideal that the translator must be male.) Brodsky criticised Garnett for blurring the distinctive authorial voices of different Russian authors:

Ronald Hingley criticized Garnett&#x27;s translations of colloquial speech in Chekhov&#x27;s stories, stating &quot;These are not very convincing samples of country speech ... or of a Russian village in the 1890s.&quot;

David Foster Wallace criticized Garnett&#x27;s translations as &#x27;excruciatingly Victorianish&#x27;.

In her translations, she worked quickly, and smoothed over certain small portions for &quot;readability&quot;, particularly in her translations of Dostoyevsky.

Her translations of Ivan Turgenev and Anton Chekhov were well regarded by Rachel May in her study on translating Russian classics, &quot;The Translator in the Text: On Reading Russian Literature in English&quot;. However, May&#x27;s study also critiqued Garnett for her tendency of &quot;stylistic homogenizing&quot; that &quot;eras[ed] those idiosyncrasies of narrative voice and dialogue that different authors possessed&quot; and for making prudish word choices that &quot;tamed [the Russian classics] further.&quot; May also analyzed how for decades, Garnett&#x27;s translations were unquestioningly acclaimed by critics because &quot;she suited the needs of her time so well, that no one knew what questions to ask.&quot;

Kornei Chukovsky respected Garnett for introducing millions of English readers to Russian literature, and praised her translations of Turgenev, stating that they &quot;fully correspond to the originals in tonality,&quot; but condemned her other translations, writing that she had reduced Dostoevsky&#x27;s style into &quot;a safe blandscript: not a volcano, but a smooth lawn mowed in the English manner—which is to say a complete distortion of the original&quot; and that the same criticisms applied to her translation of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot;. He concluded that:
In 1994 Donald Rayfield compared Garnett&#x27;s translations with the most recent scholarly versions of Chekhov&#x27;s stories and concluded:
Later translators such as Rosemary Edmonds and David Magarshack continued to use Garnett&#x27;s translations as models for their own work.

For his Norton Critical Edition of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, Ralph Matlaw based his revised version on her translation. This is the basis for the influential &quot;A Karamazov Companion&quot; by Victor Terras. Matlaw published an earlier revision of Garnett&#x27;s translation of the Grand Inquisitor chapter in a volume paired with &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;.

<text>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft Corporation which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.

Several clients exist for most versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile but the support has ended), Linux (for example Remmina), Unix, macOS, iOS, Android, and other operating systems. RDP servers are built into the server and professional editions of Windows operating systems but not home editions; an RDP server for Unix and OS X also exists (for example xrdp). By default, the server listens on TCP port 3389 and UDP port 3389.

Microsoft currently refers to their official RDP client software as Remote Desktop Connection, formerly &quot;Terminal Services Client&quot;.

The protocol is an extension of the ITU-T T.128 application sharing protocol. Microsoft makes some specifications public on their website.

== History ==

Every server and professional version of Microsoft Windows from Windows XP onward includes an installed Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) (&quot;Terminal Services&quot;) client () whose version is determined by that of the operating system or by the last applied Windows Service Pack. The Terminal Services server is supported as an official feature on Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, released in 1998, Windows 2000 Server, all editions of Windows XP except Windows XP Home Edition, Windows Server 2003, Windows Home Server, on Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs, in Windows Vista Ultimate, Enterprise and Business editions, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 and on Windows 7 Professional and above. The home versions of Windows do not support RDP.

Microsoft provides the client required for connecting to newer RDP versions for downlevel operating systems. Since the server improvements are not available downlevel, the features introduced with each newer RDP version only work on downlevel operating systems when connecting &quot;to&quot; a higher version RDP server from these older operating systems, and not when using the RDP server in the older operating system.

=== Version 4.0 ===
Based on the ITU-T T.128 application sharing protocol (during draft also known as &quot;T.share&quot;) from the T.120 recommendation series, the first version of RDP (named version 4.0) was introduced by Microsoft with &quot;Terminal Services&quot;, as a part of their product Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition. The Terminal Services Edition of NT 4.0 relied on Citrix&#x27;s MultiWin technology, previously provided as a part of Citrix WinFrame atop Windows NT 3.51, in order to support multiple users and login sessions simultaneously. Microsoft required Citrix to license their MultiWin technology to Microsoft in order to be allowed to continue offering their own terminal-services product, then named Citrix MetaFrame, atop Windows NT 4.0. The Citrix-provided DLLs included in Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Services Edition still carry a Citrix copyright rather than a Microsoft copyright. Later versions of Windows integrated the necessary support directly. The T.128 application sharing technology was acquired by Microsoft from UK software developer Data Connection Limited.

=== Version 5.0 ===
This version was introduced with Windows 2000 Server, added support for a number of features, including printing to local printers, and aimed to improve network bandwidth usage. The RDP clients available through the Windows 2000 Terminal Server Disk Creation Tool is tested and working on even 16 bit Windows 3.1 using 3rd party TCP/IP libraries such as Trumpet WinSock.

=== Version 5.1 ===
This version was introduced with Windows XP Professional and included support for 24-bit color and sound. It is supported on Windows 2000, Windows 9x, and Windows NT 4.0. With this version, the name of the client was changed from &quot;Terminal Services Client&quot; to &quot;Remote Desktop Connection&quot;; the heritage remains to this day, however, as the underlying executable is still named .

=== Version 5.2 ===
This version was introduced with Windows Server 2003, included support for console mode connections, a session directory, and local resource mapping. It also introduces Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 for server authentication, and to encrypt terminal server communications. This version is built into Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003 x64 &amp; x86 Editions, and also available for Windows XP as a download.

=== Version 6.0 ===
This version was introduced with Windows Vista and incorporated support for Windows Presentation Foundation applications, Network Level Authentication, multi-monitor spanning and large desktop support, and TLS 1.0 connections. The RDP 6.0 client is available on Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2 (x86 and x64 editions) and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition through KB925876. Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Client for Macintosh OS X is also available with support for Intel and PowerPC Mac OS versions 10.4.9 and greater.

=== Version 6.1 ===
This version was released in February 2008 and is first included with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 and later backported to Windows XP with Service Pack 3. The RDP 6.1 client is available on Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2 (x86 and x64 editions) and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition through KB952155. In addition to changes related to how a remote administrator connects to the &quot;console&quot;, this version has new functionality introduced in Windows Server 2008, such as connecting remotely to individual programs and a new client-side printer redirection system that makes the client&#x27;s print capabilities available to applications running on the server, without having to install print drivers on the server also on the other hand, remote administrator can freely install, add/remove any software or setting at the client&#x27;s end. However, to start a remote administration session, one must be a member of the Administrators group on the server to which one is trying to get connected.

=== Version 7.0 ===

This version was released to manufacturing in July 2009 and is included with Windows Server 2008 R2, as well as with Windows 7. With this release, also changed from &quot;Terminal Services&quot; to &quot;Remote Desktop Services&quot;. This version has new functions such as Windows Media Player redirection, bidirectional audio, multi-monitor support, Aero glass support, enhanced bitmap acceleration, Easy Print redirection, Language Bar docking. The RDP 7.0 client is available on Windows XP SP3 and Windows Vista SP1/SP2 through KB969084, and is not officially supported on Windows Server 2003 x86 and Windows Server 2003 / Windows XP Professional x64 editions. It is also not officially supported on Windows Server 2008.

Most RDP 7.0 features like Aero glass remote use, bidirectional audio, Windows Media Player redirection, multiple monitor support and Remote Desktop Easy Print are only available in Windows 7 Enterprise or Ultimate editions.

=== Version 7.1 ===

Release 7.1 of RDP was included with Windows 7 Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 in 2010. It introduced RemoteFX, which provides virtualized GPU support and host-side encoding.

=== Version 8.0 ===
This version was released in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. This version has new functions such as Adaptive Graphics (progressive rendering and related techniques), automatic selection of TCP or UDP as transport protocol, multi touch support, DirectX 11 support for vGPU, USB redirection supported independently of vGPU support, etc. A &quot;connection quality&quot; button is displayed in the RDP client connection bar for RDP 8.0 connections; clicking on it provides further information about connection, including whether UDP is in use or not.

The RDP 8.0 client and server components are available on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 through KB2592687. The RDP 8.0 client is also available for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, but the server components are not. The RDC 8.0 client includes support for session encryption using the TLS 1.2 standard. The add-on requires the DTLS protocol to be installed as prerequisite. After installing the updates, for the RDP 8.0 protocol to be enabled between Windows 7 machines, an extra configuration step is needed using the Group Policy editor.

A new feature in RDP 8.0 is limited support for RDP session nesting; it only works for Windows 8 and Server 2012 though, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 (even with the RDP 8.0 update) do not support this feature.

The &quot;shadow&quot; feature from RDP 7, which allowed an administrator to monitor (snoop) on a RDP connection has been removed in RDP 8. The Aero Glass remoting feature (applicable to Windows 7 machines connecting to each other) has also been removed in RDP 8.

=== Version 8.1 ===
This version was released with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. The RDP 8.1 client, like the RDP 8.0 client, is available on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 through KB2923545 but unlike the RDP 8.0 update for Windows 7, it does not add a RDP 8.1 server component to Windows 7. Furthermore, if RDP 8.0 server function is desired on Windows 7, the KB 2592687 (RDP 8.0 client and server components) update must be installed before installing the RDP 8.1 update.

Support for session shadowing was added back in RDP version 8.1. This version also fixes some visual glitches with Microsoft Office 2013 when running as a RemoteApp.

Version 8.1 of the RDP also enables a &quot;restricted admin&quot; mode. Logging into this mode only requires knowledge of the hashed password, rather than of its plaintext, therefore making a pass the hash attack possible. Microsoft has released an 82-page document explaining how to mitigate this type of attack.

=== Version 10.0 ===
Version 10.0 of the RDP was introduced with Windows 10 and includes the following new features: AutoSize zoom (useful for HiDPI clients).
In addition graphics compression improvements were included utilizing H.264/AVC.

== Features ==
* 32-bit color support. 8-, 15-, 16-, and 24-bit color are also supported.
* Encryption: option of legacy 56-bit or 128-bit RC4 and modern MITM-resistant TLS since version 5.2
* Audio Redirection allows users to process audio on a remote desktop and have the sound redirected to their local computer.
* File System Redirection allows users to use their local files on a remote desktop within the terminal session.
* Printer Redirection allows users to use their local printer within the terminal session as they would with a locally- or network-shared printer.
* Port Redirection allows applications running within the terminal session to access local serial and parallel ports directly.
* The remote computer and the local computer can share the clipboard.
* Compression goes beyond a framebuffer and takes advantage of font knowledge and tracking of window states (inherited from T.128); later extensions add more content-aware features (e.g MS-RDPCR2).

Microsoft introduced the following features with the release of RDP 6.0 in 2006:
* Seamless Windows: remote applications can run on a client machine that is served by a Remote Desktop connection. It is available since RDP 6.
* Remote Programs: application publishing with client-side file-type associations.
* Terminal Services Gateway: enables the ability to use a front-end IIS server to accept connections (over port 443) for back-end Terminal Services servers via an https connection, similar to how RPC over https allows Outlook clients to connect to a back-end Exchange 2003 server. Requires Windows Server 2008.
* Network Level Authentication
* Support for remoting the Aero Glass Theme (or Composed Desktop), including ClearType font-smoothing technology.
* Support for remoting Windows Presentation Foundation applications: compatible clients that have .NET Framework 3.0 support can display full Windows Presentation Foundation effects on a local machine.
* Rewrite of device redirection to be more general-purpose, allowing a greater variety of devices to be accessed.
* Fully configurable and scriptable via Windows Management Instrumentation.
* Improved bandwidth tuning for RDP clients.
* Support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 on both server and client ends (can be negotiated if both parties agree, but not mandatory in a default configuration of any version of Windows).
* Multiple monitor support for allowing one session to use multiple monitors on the client (disables desktop composition)

Release 7.1 of RDP in 2010 introduced the following feature:
* RemoteFX: RemoteFX provides virtualized GPU support and host-side encoding; it ships as part of Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.

The latest version of RDP supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 to protect RDP traffic.

== Security issues ==
Version 5.2 of the RDP in its default configuration is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Administrators can enable transport layer encryption to mitigate this risk.

RDP sessions are also susceptible to in-memory credential harvesting, which can be used to launch pass the hash attacks.

In March 2012, Microsoft released an update for a critical security vulnerability in the RDP. The vulnerability allowed a Windows computer to be compromised by unauthenticated clients and computer worms.

RDP client version 6.1 can be used to reveal the names and pictures of all users on the RDP Server (no matter which Windows version) in order to pick one, if no username is specified for the RDP connection.

In March 2018 Microsoft released a patch for , a remote code execution vulnerability in CredSSP, which is a Security Support Provider involved in the Microsoft Remote Desktop and Windows Remote Management, discovered by Preempt.

In May 2019 Microsoft issued a security patch for (&quot;BlueKeep&quot;), a vulnerability which allows for the possibility of remote code execution and which Microsoft warned was &quot;wormable&quot;, with the potential to cause widespread disruption. Unusually, patches were also made available for several versions of Windows that had reached their end-of-life, such as Windows XP. No immediate malicious exploitation followed, but experts were unanimous that this was likely, and could cause widespread harm based on the number of systems that appeared to have remained exposed and unpatched.

In July 2019, Microsoft issued a security patch for , a RDP vulnerability that affects Hyper-V.

== Implementations ==

=== Clients ===

Since the release of Remote Desktop Connection, there have been several additional Remote Desktop Protocol clients created by both Microsoft and other parties including Microsoft Remote Desktop, rdesktop, and FreeRDP.

=== Servers ===
In addition to the Microsoft-created Remote Desktop Services, open-source RDP servers on Unix include FreeRDP (see above), ogon project and xrdp. The Windows Remote Desktop Connection client can be used to connect to such a server. There is also Azure Virtual Desktop which makes use of RDP and is a part of the Microsoft Azure platform.

There is also a VirtualBox Remote Display Protocol (VRDP) used in the VirtualBox virtual machine implementation by Oracle. This protocol is compatible with all RDP clients, such as that provided with Windows but, unlike the original RDP, can be configured to accept unencrypted and password unprotected connections, which may be useful in secure and trusted networks, such as home or office LANs. By default, Microsoft&#x27;s RDP server refuses connections to user accounts with empty passwords (but this can be changed with the Group Policy Editor). External and guest authorization options are provided by VRDP as well. It does not matter which operating system is installed as a guest because VRDP is implemented on the virtual machine (host) level, not in the guest system. The proprietary VirtualBox Extension Pack is required.

== Patents ==
Microsoft requires third-party implementations to license the relevant RDP patents. , the extent to which open-source clients meet this requirement remains unknown.

== Use in cybercrime ==
Security researchers reported in 2016-17 that cybercriminals were selling compromised RDP servers on underground forums as well as specialized illicit RDP shops. These compromised RDPs may be used as a &quot;staging ground&quot; for conducting other types of fraud or to access sensitive personal or corporate data. Researchers further report instances of cybercriminals using RDPs to directly drop malware on computers.

<doc id="652622" wikidata="Q456685" url="?curid=652622" title="Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)">
<text>The Ambassador Hotel was a hotel in Los Angeles, California. Designed by architect Myron Hunt, the hotel formally opened to the public on January 1, 1921. Later renovations by architect Paul Williams were made to the hotel in the late 1940s. It was also home to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub, a premier Los Angeles night spot for decades; and host to six Oscar ceremonies and to every United States president from Herbert Hoover to Richard Nixon. Prominent figures in the entertainment community visited and/or performed at the Cocoanut Grove.

The hotel was the site of the assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. Due to the decline of the Ambassador Hotel and the surrounding area, the hotel was closed to guests in 1989. In 2001, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) purchased the property with the intent of constructing three new schools within the area. After subsequent litigation to preserve the hotel as a historic site, a settlement allowed demolition of the Ambassador Hotel to begin in 2005; it was completed in early 2006.

==Background==

Located at 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, between Catalina Street and Mariposa Avenue in present-day Koreatown, The Ambassador was set back from Wilshire Boulevard on 24 acres, which included the main hotel structure, a garage and numerous detached bungalows.

The Ambassador was built as part of the Ambassador Hotels System. At the time the hotel opened, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1921, the chain consisted of The Ambassador in Los Angeles, the Hotel Alexandria in Los Angeles, The Ambassador in Santa Barbara, The Ambassador in Atlantic City and The Ambassador in New York. The Santa Barbara property burned down soon after on April 13, 1921, the Alexandria left the chain in 1925, while the Ambassador Palm Beach joined in 1929. The Schine family owned The Ambassador from its opening in 1921 until 1971.

The Ambassador Hotel was frequented by celebrities, some of whom, such as Pola Negri, resided there. From 1930 to 1943, six Academy Awards ceremonies were hosted at the hotel. Perhaps as many as seven U.S. presidents stayed at the Ambassador, from Hoover to Nixon, along with chiefs of state from around the world.

For decades, the hotel&#x27;s famed Cocoanut Grove nightclub hosted well-known entertainers as patrons and/or performers, such as Lucille Ball, Shirley Bassey, Vikki Carr, Charlie Chaplin, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Natalie Cole, Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis Jr., Douglas Fairbanks, Shep Fields, Henry Fonda, Sergio Franchi, Clark Gable, Judy Garland, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, Cary Grant, Merv Griffin, Dick Haymes, Katharine Hepburn, Lena Horne, Evelyn Knight, Liberace, Little Richard, Martin and Lewis, Liza Minnelli, Marilyn Monroe, Mary Pickford, Richard Pryor, Ginger Rogers, Norma Shearer, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Yma Sumac, The Supremes, Gloria Swanson, Norma Talmadge, Spencer Tracy, Rudolph Valentino, Vivian Vance, Veloz &amp; Yolanda, John Wayne, Nancy Wilson, Anna May Wong, Loretta Young, and many others. Studio heads and major studio executives such as Howard Hughes, Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg also frequented the Cocoanut Grove.

==History==
===Early history===

Designed by American architect Myron Hunt, the Ambassador Hotel opened for business at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 1921, and quickly established a new standard of hotel luxury. Guests were greeted by a grand lobby upon arrival, with an oversized Italian fireplace, crystal chandeliers, oriental carpets and luxurious draperies adorning the lobby, along with a choice of 1,000 guestrooms and bungalows. The hotel occupied 23.7 acres at 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, bordered by Wilshire Boulevard at the north, 8th Street at the south, Catalina Street at the east, and nearly to Mariposa Avenue at the west. When the hotel&#x27;s Cocoanut Grove nightclub opened on April 21, 1921, it officially solidified the hotel&#x27;s social scene. In the 1980 book &quot;Are the Stars Out Tonight?&quot;, former Ambassador PR director Margaret Tante Burk recalled the Grove&#x27;s opening night:

&quot;...on the night of April 21, 1921… the new club officially opened its Moroccan style, gold leaf and etched palm tree doors... The Cocoanut Grove was aptly named, guests agreed as they were escorted by the maître de and captains down the wide plush grand staircase... Overhead, soaring about the room were cocoanut trees of papier mache, cocoanuts and palm fronds which had been rescued from the sandy beaches of Oxnard where they had served as atmosphere of the 1921 classic, &quot;The Sheik&quot;. Swinging from their branches were stuffed monkeys blinking at the revelers with their electrified amber eyes. Stars twinkled in the blue ceiling sky, and on the southernmost wall hung a full Hawaiian moon presiding over a painted landscape and splashing waterfall.&quot;
According to &quot;Photoplay&quot;, Joan Crawford and Carole Lombard were frequent competitors in the Charleston contests held on Friday nights; Lombard was discovered at the Grove. As Burk recalled, the famous artificial palm trees that adorned the Cocoanut Grove were left from Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s 1921 silent romantic drama film &quot;The Sheik&quot;. The names of the hotel and its nightclub quickly became synonymous with glamour. As a result, “Cocoanut Grove&quot; would become a trendy name for bars and clubs across the United States.

Beginning in 1928, Gus Arnheim led the Cocoanut Grove Orchestra, in which six to seven songs were sung each night. At one point, there was a two-hour broadcast of the orchestra on radio. On February 29, 1940, the 1939 Academy Awards ceremony was held in the Cocoanut Grove, with Bob Hope hosting the awards. The 1953 Golden Globe Awards also were presented at the hotel.

During World War II, U.S. servicemen mingled with movie stars at the hotel during numerous galas and fundraising events to help with the war effort.

Loyce Whiteman, singer for the Cocoanut Grove Orchestra, recalled, &quot;the most beautiful thing about the Grove is that they stood in front of you when you sang and just swayed to the music. Joan Crawford would stand at the stand and sing a couple of choruses with the band. It was a house full of stars.&quot;

===Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy===
On June 5, 1968, the winner of the California Democratic presidential primary election, United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy, gave a victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel to supporters. After the speech in the Embassy Room, Kennedy was shot three times along with five other people in the pantry area of the hotel&#x27;s main kitchen soon after midnight. Palestinian immigrant Sirhan Sirhan was arrested at the scene and later convicted of the murder. Kennedy died the following day at Good Samaritan Hospital; the other victims all survived. During the demolition of the Ambassador Hotel in late 2005 and early 2006, portions of the area where the 1968 shooting occurred were eliminated from the site. The section of Wilshire Boulevard in front of the hotel has been signed the &quot;Robert F. Kennedy Parkway&quot;.

===Decline and closure===
The death of Robert F. Kennedy marked the demise of the hotel coinciding with the decline of the surrounding neighborhood during the late 1960s and 1970s. The area also saw a surge of illegal drugs, poverty, and gang activity infiltrating the Wilshire corridor. Under the direction of Sammy Davis, Jr., the “Now Grove” replaced the classic Cocoanut Grove in 1970 in order to appeal to a modern nightclub crowd. However, patrons lost interest in both the hotel and the neighborhood surrounding it, which caused the Ambassador Hotel to fall into disrepair throughout the years. The Ambassador Hotel closed to guests in 1989, but it remained opened for filming and hosting private events. In 1991, Donald Trump, who had bought the hotel in hopes of tearing it down to build a 125-story building, sold off silver serving platters with the hotel&#x27;s eagle-topped crest, tiki-style soup bowls from the famed Cocoanut Grove nightclub, and beds and nightstands from the rooms.

===Preservation efforts===
In 2004 and 2005, the Ambassador Hotel became the focus of a legal struggle between the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), which planned to clear the site and construct a school on the property, and the Los Angeles Conservancy and the Art Deco Society of Los Angeles, which wanted the hotel and its various elements preserved and integrated into the future school.

The Location Managers Guild organized an event together with the Jefferson High School Academy of Film and Television in March 2005, entitled &quot;Last Looks: The Ambassador Hotel&quot;. They mentored students in script breakdown and location scouting, using the hotel as a potential location to be scouted, documenting the property one last time. The images taken by both the students and the professionals were then exhibited side by side at Los Angeles City Hall.

After much litigation, a settlement was reached at the end of August 2005, allowing the demolition to begin in exchange for the establishment of a $4.9 million fund, reserved for saving historic school buildings in the Los Angeles Unified School District.

===Demolition===

On September 10, 2005, a final public auction was held for the remaining fittings in the hotel&#x27;s parking lot, with demolition commencing soon afterwards. On January 16, 2006, the last section of the Ambassador Hotel fell, leaving only the annex that housed the hotel&#x27;s entrance, shopping arcade, coffee shop, and the Cocoanut Grove, which were promised to be preserved in some manner and integrated within the new school. A ceremony commemorating the demolition of the hotel was held across the street on February 2, 2006, at the H.M.S. Bounty restaurant, located on the ground floor of the Gaylord Apartments.

The Cocoanut Grove was renovated several times before, which destroyed much of its architectural integrity. It was promised that it would undergo yet another major transformation before becoming the auditorium for the new school. Also promised was preservation of the attached ground floor coffee shop, designed by architect Paul Williams. Studies by the LAUSD determined that the integrity of the Cocoanut Grove was weaker than anticipated and that they could neither use it within the planned school nor move it without risking its destruction. In 2004, the LAUSD board voted in favor of demolishing most of the Cocoanut Grove, retaining only the hotel entrance and east wall of the Grove. Litigation between the district and the Los Angeles Conservancy, which had sought to preserve the hotel, was settled out of court on December 18, 2007; demolition began on January 22, 2008.

===New school===

The Central Los Angeles New Learning Center #1 K–3, and Central Los Angeles New Learning Center #1 4–8/HS, along with the Robert F. Kennedy Inspiration Park, were built on the site.

The six schools were named as the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools. The K–3 facility opened on September 9, 2009, and the 4–8 and high school facility began operation on September 14, 2010. The north side of the new school has a slightly similar appearance to the original facade of the hotel and north lawns will remain much the same, as seen from Wilshire Boulevard.

==In popular culture==
===Movies and television===
The Ambassador Hotel was a filming location and backdrop for movies and television programs, starting with Jean Harlow&#x27;s 1933 film &quot;Bombshell&quot;. An early MGM color short film, &quot;Starlit Days at the Lido&quot; (1935), was filmed in the Lido Spa at the hotel. In the 1980s and early 2000s, the hotel was filmed in &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;; &quot;Blow&quot;; &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;; &quot;The Italian Job&quot;; &quot;Mafia!&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;; and much more. It was also used in period films such as &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Hoffa&quot;, and &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;.

The interactive movie/game based on the 1995 film &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; was filmed there with a $3 million budget.

The last project filmed in the Ambassador Hotel&#x27;s kitchen was &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;, a 2004 episode of the TV series &quot;Angel&quot;. The 2006 film &quot;Bobby&quot; was the last project to film on the hotel property, gaining access in late 2005 to film crucial establishing shots even while portions of the hotel were already in the process of being demolished.

The Ambassador Hotel itself has also been depicted in films. The Cocoanut Grove was recreated in the films &quot;The Aviator&quot; and &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;.

===Musical events and music videos===
The Cocoanut Grove hosted musician Roy Orbison and several performers on September 30, 1987, for the television special &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night&quot;, first shown on Cinemax on January 3, 1988.

Guns N&#x27; Roses filmed the video of their song &quot;Patience&quot;, in the hotel in 1989.

R&amp;B singer Chuckii Booker filmed the video of his song &quot;Games&quot; from the album &quot;Niice &#x27;n Wiild&quot; at the hotel in 1992.

The hotel served as the filming location for the video of the 1997 Marilyn Manson single &quot;Long Hard Road Out of Hell,&quot; off the soundtrack for the Todd McFarlane motion picture &quot;Spawn&quot;.

In November 1997, punk-rock band Green Day filmed the video of the song &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; in the hotel.

Rock band 311 used the lobby of the hotel as the backdrop for a photo shoot of the cover of their 2003 album &quot;Evolver&quot;.

Also on October 29, 2002, rock band Linkin Park held their press photo shoot for their album &quot;Meteora&quot; at the hotel.

<text>Otto Robert Frisch (1 October 1904 – 22 September 1979) was an Austrian-born British physicist who worked on nuclear physics. With Otto Stern and Immanuel Estermann, he first measured the magnetic moment of the proton. With his aunt, Lise Meitner, he advanced the first theoretical explanation of nuclear fission (coining the term) and first experimentally detected the fission by-products. Later, with his collaborator, Rudolf Peierls, he designed the first theoretical mechanism for the detonation of an atomic bomb in 1940. Leading the Los Alamos Critical Assemblies experiments in 1945, he oversaw the world&#x27;s first prompt criticality in the Dragon device.

== Early life ==
Otto Robert Frisch was born in Vienna in 1904 to a Jewish family, the son of Justinian Frisch, a painter, and Auguste Meitner Frisch, a concert pianist. He himself was talented at both but also shared his maternal aunt Lise Meitner&#x27;s love of physics and commenced a period of study at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1926 with some work on the effect of the newly discovered electron on salts.

==Nuclear physics==
After some years working in relatively obscure laboratories in Germany, Frisch obtained a position in Hamburg under the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Otto Stern. Here he produced work on the diffraction of atoms (using crystal surfaces) and also proved that the magnetic moment of the proton was much larger than had been previously supposed.

The accession of Adolf Hitler to the chancellorship of Germany in 1933 caused Otto Robert Frisch to make the decision to move to London, where he joined the staff at Birkbeck College and worked with the physicist Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett on cloud chamber technology and artificial radioactivity. He followed this with a five-year stint in Copenhagen with Niels Bohr where he increasingly specialised in nuclear physics, particularly in neutron physics.

==Nuclear fission==
During the Christmas holiday in 1938, he visited his aunt Lise Meitner in Kungälv. While there she received the news that Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Berlin had discovered that the collision of a neutron with a uranium nucleus produced the element barium as one of its byproducts. Hahn, in a letter to Meitner, called this new reaction a &quot;bursting&quot; of the uranium nucleus. Frisch and Meitner hypothesized that the uranium nucleus had split in two, explained the process, and estimated the energy released, and Frisch coined the term fission, adopted from a process in biology, to describe it.

Political restraints of the Nazi era forced the teams of Hahn and Strassmann and that of Frisch and Meitner (both of whom were Jewish) to publish separately. Hahn&#x27;s paper described the experiment and the finding of the barium byproduct. Meitner&#x27;s and Frisch&#x27;s paper explained the physics behind the phenomenon.

Frisch went back to Copenhagen, where he was quickly able to isolate the pieces produced by fission reactions. As Frisch himself later recalled, a fundamental idea of the direct experimental proof of the nuclear fission was suggested to him by George Placzek. Many feel that Meitner and Frisch deserved Nobel Prize recognition for their contributions to understanding fission.

In mid-1939 Frisch left Denmark for what he anticipated would be a short trip to Birmingham, but the outbreak of World War II precluded his return. With war on his mind, he and the physicist Rudolf Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum at the University of Birmingham, which was the first document to set out a process by which an atomic explosion could be generated. Their process would use separated uranium-235, which would require a fairly small critical mass and could be made to achieve criticality using conventional explosives to create an immensely powerful detonation. The memorandum went on to predict the effects of such an explosion—from the initial blast to the resulting fallout. This memorandum was the basis of British work on building an atomic device (the Tube Alloys project) and also that of the Manhattan Project on which Frisch worked as part of the British delegation. Frisch and Rudolf Peierls worked together in the Physics Department at the University of Birmingham 1939–40. He went to America in 1943 having been hurriedly made a British subject.

==Manhattan Project==

In 1944 at Los Alamos, one of Frisch&#x27;s tasks as the leader of the Critical Assemblies group was to accurately determine the exact amount of enriched uranium which would be required to create the critical mass, the mass of uranium which would sustain a nuclear chain reaction. He did this by stacking several dozen 3 cm bars of enriched uranium hydride at a time and measuring rising neutron activity as the critical mass was approached. The hydrogen in the metal bars increased the time that the reaction required to accelerate. One day Frisch almost caused a runaway reaction by leaning over the stack, which he termed the &quot;Lady Godiva assembly&quot;. His body reflected neutrons back into the stack. Out of the corner of his eye he saw that the red lamps that flickered intermittently when neutrons were being emitted, were &#x27;glowing continuously&#x27;. Realizing what was happening, Frisch quickly scattered the bars with his hand. Later he calculated that the radiation dose was &quot;quite harmless&quot; but that if he &quot;had hesitated for another two seconds before removing the material ... the dose would have been fatal&quot;. &quot;In two seconds he received, by the generous standards of the time, a full day&#x27;s permissible dose of neutron radiation.&quot; In this way his experiments determined the exact masses of uranium required to fire the Little Boy bomb over Hiroshima.

He also designed the &quot;dragon&#x27;s tail&quot; or &quot;guillotine&quot; experiment in which a uranium slug was dropped through a hole in larger fixed mass of uranium, reaching just above critical mass (0.1%) for a fraction of a second. At the meeting to approve the experiment, Richard Feynman, commenting on the transient danger involved, said it was &quot;just like tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon.&quot; In the period of about 3 milliseconds, the temperature rose at a rate of 2000 °C per sec and over 1015 excess neutrons were emitted.

==Return to England==

In 1946 he returned to England to take up the post of head of the nuclear physics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, though he also spent much of the next thirty years teaching at Cambridge where he was Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy and a fellow of Trinity College.

Before he retired he designed a device, SWEEPNIK, that used a laser and computer to measure tracks in bubble chambers. Seeing that this had wider applications, he helped found a company, Laser-Scan Limited, now known as Laser-Scan Engineering Ltd., to exploit the idea.

== Retirement ==

He retired from the chair in 1972 as required by University regulations. He died on 22 September 1979.

<text>William Branch Giles (August 12, 1762December 4, 1830) was an American statesman, long-term Senator from Virginia, and the 24th Governor of Virginia. He served in the House of Representatives from 1790 to 1798 and again from 1801 to 1803; in between, he was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and was an Elector for Jefferson (and Aaron Burr) in 1800. He served as a United States Senator from 1804 to 1815 and then served briefly in the House of Delegates again. After a time in private life, he joined the opposition to John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay in 1824; he ran for the Senate again in 1825 and was defeated but appointed Governor for three one-year terms in 1827; he was succeeded by John Floyd, in the year of his death.

==Biography==
He was born and died in Amelia County, where he built his home, The Wigwam. Giles attended Prince Edward Academy, now Hampden–Sydney College, and the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University; he probably followed Samuel Stanhope Smith, who was teaching at Prince Edward Academy when he was appointed President of the College in 1779. He then went on to study law with Chancellor George Wythe and at the College of William and Mary; he was admitted to the bar in 1786. Giles supported the new Constitution during the ratification debates of 1788 but was not a member of the ratifying convention.

Giles was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election in 1790, taking the seat of Theodorick Bland, who had died in office on June 1; he is believed to be the first member of the United States Congress to be elected in a special election. He was to be re-elected three times; he resigned on October 2, 1798, on the grounds of ill health and in disgust at the Alien and Sedition Acts.

During this first period in Congress, he fervently supported his fellow Virginians James Madison and Thomas Jefferson against Alexander Hamilton and his ideas for a national bank preferring Jefferson&#x27;s idea of an agrarian republic. Working with Jefferson and Madison, he introduced three sets of resolutions in 1793, which attempted to censure Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;administration of finances&quot; as Secretary of the Treasury to the point of accusing him of maladministration in office under the Funding Act of 1790 to force the US to repay America&#x27;s debts to France following the French Revolution. Per this goal, he opposed the pro-British Jay&#x27;s Treaty and resisted naval appropriation to be used against France during the Quasi-War. In the same year, he voted for the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in the House of Delegates to declare the Alien and Sedition Acts unconstitutional.

After another term in the House, from 1801 to 1803, Giles was appointed as a Senator from Virginia after the resignation of Wilson Cary Nicholas in 1804. Giles served in the US Senate and was reappointed in 1810 until he resigned on March 3, 1815. Giles strongly advocated the removal of Justice Samuel Chase after his impeachment, urging the Senate to consider it as a political decision (as to whether the people of the United States should have confidence in Chase) rather than as a trial.

Giles was deeply disappointed by the acquittal of Chase. He supported the election of Madison as president in 1808, in preference to the Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Giles was Madison&#x27;s chief advocate in Virginia.

After the election, however, he joined with Senator Samuel Smith of Maryland and his brother Robert Smith, the Secretary of State, in criticizing Madison; first as too weak on Britain and then, in 1812, as too precipitate in going to war; however, voted for the declaration of war. He disliked Albert Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury, who was primarily responsible for preventing his nomination as Secretary of State and defeating Gallatin&#x27;s bill of 1811 for a new Bank of the United States.

Giles&#x27;s refusal to accept the General Assembly&#x27;s instructions led to his rejection at the next poll for a senator. (The state legislatures elected senators in those days.) Giles served one relatively uneventful term in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1816–1817 and then retired from political office for a time. He, however, published opinion pieces and columns, chiefly in the Richmond, Virginia, &quot;Enquirer&quot;, in which he deplored the Era of Good Feelings as false prosperity, given over to banks, tariffs, and fraudulent internal improvements; these would centralize and corrupt government, and ruin the farmers. He attacked John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay as he had attacked Hamilton, calling them corrupt Anglophiles.

Giles also published a criticism of the Jeffersonian program for public education. Giles argued that it was unjust to tax one man to educate another man&#x27;s children, and the teachers that the government employed would constitute a special interest, always ready to vote for higher taxes and government spending. Besides, he said, giving every boy in Virginia three years of school would have limited practical utility, deprive farm families of much-needed labor power, and leave the typical &quot;scholar&quot; unfitted for the return to hard labor that awaited him.

When James Barbour left the Senate in 1825, Giles attempted to persuade the legislature to appoint him as a replacement; they appointed John Randolph instead. In 1826, Giles was again elected to the House of Delegates, and in 1827 he was elected Governor; Giles served as Governor of Virginia for three terms, from March 4, 1827, to March 4, 1830. From the governorship, Giles encouraged Virginia&#x27;s Senator Littleton Waller Tazewell to organize a southern resistance to the American System of Henry Clay centered on a boycott on northern manufactures. Tazewell found little support for it among southern senators.

In Giles&#x27;s last term, he was a member of the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829–1830 where he strongly supported the existing apportionment of the House of Delegates, giving the eastern counties of Virginia, with a minority of the voters, control of the legislature. He did favor reform of the suffrage requirements, however. Giles also opposed the movement in the convention to strengthen his own office, the governorship. Strong governorships in other states, such as New York, were at the center of political machines kept together by patronage and corruption, he said, and the reason that Virginia had not suffered from those ills was that the governorship in his state was too weak to be worth fighting for. Rather than follow the example of New York, with its party machine, it was better for Virginia to retain George Mason&#x27;s executive model. Giles lost to some extent: while the governor&#x27;s term remained short and was still accountable to the General Assembly, the Constitution of 1830 abolished the privy council, thus making the governorship a bit more independent.

==Legacy==
Giles&#x27;s historical reputation has been mixed. Frederick Scott Oliver called him a &quot;preposterous, pugilistic character&quot; marked by a &quot;reckless disregard of truth&quot; and by &quot;the grossness of his nature.&quot; Joseph Story, though taking similar umbrage at Giles&#x27;s alleged rhetorical excesses and noting the poor impression made by his dowdy appearance, wrote that, &quot;when he speaks, your opinion immediately changes&quot;:[A] clear, nervous expression, a well-digested and powerful condensation of language, give to the continual flow of his thoughts an uninterrupted impression. He holds his subject always before him, and surveys it with untiring eyes; he points his objections with calculated force, and sustains his positions with penetrating and wary argument. He certainly possesses great natural strength of mind; and if he reasons on false principles or with sophistic evasions, he always brings to his subject a weight of thought, which can be shaken or disturbed only by the attack of superior wisdom.Claude Bowers called Oliver&#x27;s appraisal a &quot;wretchedly unfair caricature&quot; and advanced a favorable view, noting, among other things, praise that Giles received from Patrick Henry, John Randolph of Roanoke, and other contemporaries.

Giles married twice; first, Martha Peyton Tabb, in 1797; he built his 18-room house, &quot;The Wigwam,&quot; for her. They had three children. After she died in 1808, he married Frances Ann Gwynn in 1810 and had three more children.

Counties in two states were named in his honor: Giles County, Virginia and Giles County, Tennessee. His name also graces a residence hall at the College of William and Mary.

The Wigwam was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.

<text>Otto Guevara Guth (born 13 October 1960) is a politician in Costa Rica and founder of the Partido Movimiento Libertario (Libertarian Movement Party). He served in the Costa Rican legislature from 1998-2002 and 2014-2018. Guevara is currently the president of the Libertarian Movement Party and has been its candidate for president of Costa Rica in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014.

==Personal history==
Otto Guevara is the son of civil servants. His father, Claudio, was a physician for Costa Rica’s social security system. His mother, Mariechen, worked for the Social Security system before resigning to run the family&#x27;s tourism business.

Guevara studied at the University of Costa Rica where he earned bachelor&#x27;s degree in law followed by a Masters in International Business from National University and a second master&#x27;s degree in Law with an emphasis on Conflict Resolution from Harvard University. He was also a long-serving professor of law at the University of Costa Rica where he imparted his understanding of education and conflict resolution to his students.

In addition to his work as a lawyer and a professor, he has also made a name in tourism, commercial trade, and public policy. He also produced and hosted a number of television and radio shows focused on his moderate pro-freedom message.

==Political history==
Failing to see any representation for his values in Costa Rica’s traditional parties, Guevara founded the Movimiento Libertario in 1994 to challenge the conventional orthodoxy of Costa Rican politics which he saw as lurching towards greater corruption and less respect for the individual rights of his people. He believes that the principles of moderate intervention of the State and more economic freedom as the best way to improve the lives of the Costa Rican people.

First elected to congress as the sole representative for the Movimiento Libertario in 1998, Guevara earned recognition as Costa Rica’s best legislator by the press every year of his first term. In 2002, Libertarian Movement, with Guevara as the presidential candidate, elected 6 members to Congress out of 57 seats, but few weeks later they lost a Congressman, declared independent. After a split within the party that saw a group of libertarian members leave, Guevara said his party was moving to be liberal and not libertarian.

The year 2006 saw the Libertarian Movement Party again elect 6 members to congress, but they lost again other Congressman. As a presidential candidate in 2006, Guevara earned almost 10% of the vote. In 2009, Guevara is elected presidential candidate for third time. In February 2010, Guevara lost the Presidential election with 20% of the vote for a third-place finish. 

Then in 2014 he ran for president one more time, but falling into an 11% of the votes and obtaining 4 members to the Congress one of them being himself. On election day, Guevara was involved in a religious controversy, as his girlfriend Deborah Formal was seen on national television pocketing part of the host after receiving Eucharist at Catholic Mass.

Guevara signed the &quot;Madrid Charter&quot;, a document drafted by the conservative Spanish political party Vox that describes left-wing groups as enemies of Ibero-America involved in a &quot;criminal project&quot; that are &quot;under the umbrella of the Cuban regime&quot;.
In the 2022 elections, he ran for Congress but received just over 9,000 votes and did not win a seat. 

In November 2022, he was sentenced to two years in prison for four crimes of falsehood in an affidavit. The sentence was reduced to one year and six months, but Guevara will not serve time in prison because he was granted the benefit of conditional execution of the sentence for three years. 

In the same resolution, the former deputy was disqualified from holding public office for the same term of one year and six months.

<doc id="652643" wikidata="Q178913" url="?curid=652643" title="Empire of Trebizond">
<text>TheEmpire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was one of the three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that existed during the 13th through to the 15th century. The empire consisted of the Pontus, or far northeastern corner of Anatolia, and portions of southern Crimea.

The Trapezuntine Empire was formed in 1204 with the help of Queen Tamar of Georgia after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, which was commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the Sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself emperor and established himself in Trebizond (now Trabzon in Turkey).

Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of the deposed emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as Roman emperors against Alexios V Doukas. While the rulers of Trebizond bore the title of emperor until the end of their state in 1461, their rivals, the Laskarids in Nikaia and the Palaiologoi in Constantinople contested their claim to the imperial title until the later fourteenth century. In the thirteenth century, George Pachymeres would call them the princes of the Laz, while Demetrios Kydones in the mid fourteenth century would claim that the emperors at Constantinople had given the rulers of Trebizond their state. For the rulers in Constantinople, Trebizond was often viewed as a rebellious former vassal or barbarian who had broken loose and proclaimed themselves as emperors but the emperors in Trebizond never renounced their imperial claim.

After the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade overthrew Alexios V and established the Latin Empire, the Empire of Trebizond became one of three Byzantine successor states to claim the imperial throne alongside the Empire of Nicaea under the Laskaris family and the Despotate of Epirus under a branch of the Angelos family. The ensuing wars saw the Empire of Thessalonica, the imperial government that sprang from Epirus, collapse following conflicts with Nicaea and the Second Bulgarian Empire and the final recapture of Constantinople by the Nicaeans in 1261.

Despite the Nicaean reconquest, the Emperors of Trebizond continued to style themselves as Roman emperor for two decades and to press their claim on the imperial throne. Emperor John II of Trebizond officially gave up the Trapezuntine claim to the Roman imperial title and Constantinople itself 21 years after the Nicaeans recaptured the city, altering his imperial title from &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans&quot; to &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of all the East, Iberia and Perateia&quot;.

The Trapezuntine monarchy survived the longest among the Byzantine successor states. The Despotate of Epirus had ceased to contest the Byzantine throne even before the Nicaean reconquest and was briefly occupied by the restored Byzantine Empire , thereafter becoming a Serbian Imperial dependency later inherited by Italians, ultimately falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1479.

The restored empire ended in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. Trebizond lasted until 1461, when the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity.

The Crimean Principality of Theodoro, an offshoot of Trebizond, lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in 1475.

== Origins ==
Trebizond already had a long history of autonomous rule before it became the center of a small empire in the Late Middle Ages. Due to its natural harbours, defensible topography and access to silver and copper mines, Trebizond became the pre-eminent Greek colony on the eastern Black Sea shore soon after its founding. Its remoteness from Roman capitals gave local rulers the opportunity to advance their own interest. In the centuries before the founding of the empire the city had been under control of the local Gabras family, which – while officially still remaining part of the Byzantine Empire – minted its own coin.

The rulers of Trebizond called themselves &quot;Megas Komnenos&quot; (&quot;Great Comnenus&quot;) and – like their counterparts in the other two Byzantine successor states, the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus – initially claimed supremacy as &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans&quot;. However, after Michael VIII Palaiologos of Nicaea recaptured Constantinople in 1261, the Komnenian use of the style &quot;Emperor&quot; became a sore point. In 1282, John II Komnenos, as a result of a treaty with Michael, stripped off his imperial regalia before the walls of Constantinople before entering to marry Michael&#x27;s daughter, accepting his legal title of despot. However, his successors used a version of his title, &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the entire East, of the Iberians and the Perateia&quot; until the Empire&#x27;s end in 1461.

== Geography ==

Geographically, the Empire of Trebizond consisted of the narrow strip along the southern coast of the Black Sea and the western half of the Pontic Mountains along with the Gazarian Perateia, or southern Crimea (soon losing to the Genoese Gazaria and the Theodorite Gazaria).

The core of the empire was the southern Black Sea coast from the mouth of the Yeşilırmak, a region known to the Trapezuntines as Limnia, possibly as far east as Akampsis, a region then known as Lazia. Anthony Bryer has argued that six of the seven &quot;banda&quot; of the theme &quot;district&quot; of Chaldia were maintained in working order by the rulers of Trebizond until the end of the empire, helped by geography.

Geography also defined the southern border of this state: the Pontic Alps served as a barrier first to Seljuk Turks and later to Turkmens, whose predations were reduced to a volume that the emperors could cope with. This territory corresponds to an area comprising all or parts of the current Turkish provinces of Sinop, Samsun, Ordu, Giresun, Trabzon, Bayburt, Gümüşhane, Rize, and coastal parts of Artvin.

In the 13th century, some experts believe the empire controlled the Gazarian Perateia, which included Cherson and Kerch on the Crimean peninsula. David Komnenos, the younger brother of the first Emperor, expanded rapidly to the west, occupying first Sinope, then coastal parts of Paphlagonia (the modern-day coastal regions of Kastamonu, Bartın, and Zonguldak) and Heraclea Pontica (the modern-day Karadeniz Ereğli), until his territory bordered the Empire of Nicaea. The expansion was, however, short-lived: the territories west of Sinope were lost to Theodore I Laskaris by 1214, and Sinope itself fell to the Seljuks that same year, although the emperors of Trebizond continued to fight for its control over the rest of the 13th century.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The city of Trebizond was the capital of the theme of Chaldia, which according to the 10th century Arab geographer Abulfeda was regarded as being largely a Lazican port. Chaldia had already shown its separatist tendencies in the 10th and 11th centuries when it came under the control of a local leader named Theodore Gabras, who according to Anna Komnene regarded Trebizond and its hinterlands &quot;as a prize which had fallen to his own lot&quot; and conducted himself as an independent prince. The Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos confirmed him as governor of Chaldia but kept his son at Constantinople as a hostage for his good conduct.

Nevertheless, Gabras proved himself a worthy guardian by repelling a Georgian attack on Trebizond. One of his successors, Gregory Taronites, also rebelled with the aid of the sultan of Cappadocia, but he was defeated and imprisoned, only to be made governor once more. Another successor to Theodore was Constantine Gabras, whom Niketas describes as ruling Trebizond as a tyrant, and whose actions led Emperor John II Komnenos in 1139 to lead an expedition against him. Although that effort came to nothing, this was the last rebel governor known to record history before the events of 1204.

=== Foundation ===

The empire traces its foundation to April 1204, when Alexios Komnenos and his brother David took advantage of the preoccupation of the central Byzantine government with the encampment of the soldiers of the Fourth Crusade outside their walls (June 1203 – mid-April 1204) and seized the city of Trebizond and the surrounding province of Chaldia with troops provided by their relative, Tamar of Georgia. Henceforth, the links between Trebizond and Georgia remained close, but their nature and extent have been disputed. However some scholars believe that the new state was subject to Georgia, at least in the first years of its existence, at the beginning of the 13th century.

Both men were the grandsons of the last Komnenian Byzantine emperor, Andronikos I Komnenos, by his son Manuel Komnenos and Rusudan, daughter of George III of Georgia. Andronikos I had been deposed by Isaac II Angelos, while Manuel was blinded (a traditional Byzantine punishment for treason) and died not long after. Alexios and his brother, David, ended up at the court of Queen Tamar of Georgia, who gave them military support to return to Byzantine territory. Vasiliev explains that she had been motivated to do so after the Emperor Alexios III Angelos stole the gifts Tamar had given to a group of visiting monks as they passed through Constantinople. While Michel Kurskanskis has argued in support of Vasiliev&#x27;s interpretation, he disagrees with Vasiliev over the intent of Tamar&#x27;s intervention: Vasiliev has argued that the Queen intended to create a buffer state to protect the Georgian Kingdom, while Kurskanskis believes she supported the brothers in their attempt to reclaim the Byzantine throne in Constantinople.

After marching from Georgia, and with the help of their paternal aunt Queen Tamar, Alexios and David occupied Trebizond in April 1204. That same month Alexios was proclaimed emperor at the age of 22, an act considered by later writers as the moment the Empire of Trebizond was founded. Alexios ruled his new empire for the next eighteen years, until his death in February 1222. The throne then passed to his son-in-law Andronikos I Gidos Komnenos.

=== Up to the civil wars ===

The date Alexios entered Trebizond may be narrowed down even further. Sergey Karpov has identified a lead seal of Alexios, on one side &quot;the image of a strategos in the peaked helmet led by hand by St. George&quot; with the inscriptions Ἀλέξιος ὁ Κομνηνός [Alexios Komnenos] and Ὁ Ἅ(γιος) Γεώργιος [Saint George] on either side; on the obverse is a scene of Ἡ Ἁγία Ἀνάστασις [The Holy Resurrection] with the corresponding inscription. Karpov interprets the significance of this image and the inscription as portraying the most important achievement of his life, St. George inviting the victorious prince to enter Trebizond and opening the gates of the city with his left hand. The importance of St. George was that Easter—the date of the Resurrection—in 1204 fell on 25 April, while the memorial date of St. George was 23 April. &quot;So I dared to assume,&quot; writes Karpov, &quot;that the seal points out the date of the capture of Trebizond.&quot;

Vasiliev points out that the brothers occupied Trebizond too early to have done so in response to the Crusaders capturing Constantinople; Alexios and David began their march on Trebizond before news of the Sack of Constantinople on 13 April 1204 could reach either Trebizond or Georgia. According to Vasiliev, however, their original intention was not to seize a base from which they could recover the capital of the Byzantine Empire, but rather to carve out of the Byzantine Empire a buffer state to protect Georgia from the Seljuk Turks. Kuršanskis, while agreeing with Vasiliev that Tamar was motivated by revenge for Alexios Angelos&#x27;s insult, proposed a more obvious motivation for the brother&#x27;s return to Byzantine territory: they had decided to raise the banner of revolt, depose Alexios Angelos, and return the imperial throne to the Komnenos dynasty. However, not long after they had gained control of Trebizond and the neighboring territories, news of the Latin conquest of Constantinople reached them, and the brothers entered the competition for recovery of the imperial city against Theodore I Laskaris in western Anatolia (ruler of the &quot;Empire of Nicaea&quot;) and Michael Komnenos Doukas in mainland Greece (ruler of the &quot;Despotate of Epirus&quot;).

For most of the 13th century Trebizond was in continual conflict with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm and later with the Ottoman Turks, as well as Constantinople and the Republic of Genoa. It was an empire more in title than in fact, surviving by playing its rivals against each other, and offering the daughters of its rulers, who were famed for their beauty, for marriage with generous dowries, especially with the Turkish rulers of inland Anatolia. The common view is that the Empire of Trebizond relied heavily upon wealth gained from its trade with Genoese and Venetian merchants to secure for itself the resources necessary to maintain independence.

The second son of Alexios I, Manuel I (1238–1263), preserved internal security and acquired the reputation of a great commander. His accomplishments included capturing Sinope in 1254. He was the first ruler to issue silver coins, which were known as &quot;aspers&quot;.

The destruction of Baghdad by Hulagu Khan in 1258 diverted the western terminus of the Silk Road north to the Black Sea, and due to its link with their local capital at Tabriz, Trebizond accumulated tremendous wealth under the suzerainty of the Mongols. Western travelers used Trebizond as their starting point for journeys into Asia; these travelers included Marco Polo, who returned to Europe in 1295 by way of Trebizond. The troubled reign of Manuel&#x27;s youngest son John II (1280–1297) included a reconciliation with the restored Byzantine Empire and the end of Trapezuntine claims to Constantinople. Trebizond enjoyed a period of wealth and influence during the long reign of John&#x27;s eldest son Alexios II (1297–1330). During his reign, the city of Erzurum was also under Trebizond Empire occupation for a while around the 1310s.

=== From the civil wars to the end of the 14th century ===
Following the death of Alexios II, Trebizond suffered a period of repeated imperial depositions and assassinations, despite a short period of stability under his youngest son Basil (1332–1340). Two groups struggled for ascendency: the &quot;Scholaroi&quot;, who have been identified as being pro-Byzantine, and the &quot;Amytzantarantes&quot;, who were identified as representing the interests of the native &quot;archontes&quot;. The years 1347–1348 marked the apex of this lawless period. The Turks took advantage of the weakness of the empire, conquering Oinaion and besieging Trebizond, while the Genoese seized Kerasus. In addition, the Black Death spread from Caffa to ravage Trebizond and other Pontic cities. Bending under the weight of the disasters that accumulated on his states, Emperor Michael abdicated in 1349 in favor of his nephew, Alexios III, who gradually brought the partisans of both factions under control.

Under the rule of Alexios III, Trebizond was considered an important trade center and was renowned for its great wealth and artistic accomplishment. It was at this point that their famous diplomatic strategy of marrying the princesses of the Grand Komnenos to neighboring Turkish dynasts began. However, Anthony Bryers has argued against thinking this empire was a wealthy polity, stating that while the income from taxes levied on this trade was &quot;by Byzantine standards&quot; substantial, as much as three quarters of the income of the Emperor came from land &quot;either directly from the imperial estates or indirectly from taxes and tithes from other lands.&quot;

=== 15th century ===
The last years of the fourteenth century were characterized by the increasing Turkish threat. This threat was not from the small Turkmen emirates that bordered Trebizond, but from the dynasty of the Osmanli, a new Turkish power emerging from western Anatolia that would soon consolidate the Ottoman Empire. Although their expansion was temporarily checked by Tamerlane at the Battle of Ankara in 1402, by the 1430s the Ottomans had recovered their fortunes, seizing large segments of Greece and finally capturing Constantinople itself on 29 May 1453. Manuel III (1390–1417), the second son and successor of Alexios III, had allied himself with Tamerlane, but the mighty conqueror soon left Anatolia, and the empire he had built crumbled with his death. Manuel&#x27;s son Alexios IV (1417–1429) continued the tradition of political marriages by marrying two of his daughters to rulers of two neighboring Muslim empires: Jihan Shah, khan of the Kara Koyunlu, and Ali Beg, khan of the Ak Koyunlu. His eldest daughter Maria became the third wife of the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos. 

Alexios IV&#x27;s eldest son, John IV (1429–1459), could not help but see that his Empire would soon share the fate of Constantinople. The Ottoman sultan Murad II first attempted to take the capital by the sea in 1442, but high surf made the landings difficult and the attempt was repulsed. While Murad&#x27;s son and successor, Mehmed II, was away laying siege to Belgrade in 1456, the Ottoman governor of Amasya attacked Trebizond, and although defeated, he took many prisoners and extracted a heavy tribute. A Genoese document records the seizure of one of their ships at that port in 1437 by a military Galley on the orders of Emperor John IV.

John IV prepared for the eventual assault by forging alliances. He sent an envoy to the Council of Florence in 1439, the humanist George Amiroutzes, which resulted in the proclamation of the Union of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, but this proclamation brought little help. He gave his daughter Theodora (also known by the name of Despina Khatun) to the son of his brother-in-law, Uzun Hasan, khan of the Ak Koyunlu, in return for his promise to defend Trebizond. He also secured promises of help from the Turkish emirs of Sinope and Karamania, and from the king and princes of Georgia. Through Theodora and the daughter of Alexios IV of Trebizond (also named Theodora), the Safavid dynasty of Iran that succeeded the Ak Koyunlu, would be of direct partial Pontic Greek ethnicity from its very beginning, Ismail I being the grandson of Theodora.

After John&#x27;s death in 1459, his brother David came to power. David intrigued with various European powers for help against the Ottomans, speaking of wild schemes that included the conquest of Jerusalem. Mehmed II eventually heard of these intrigues and was further provoked to action by David&#x27;s demand that Mehmed remit the tribute imposed on his brother.

Mehmed&#x27;s response came in the summer of 1461. He collected a sizable army at Bursa, and in a surprise move marched on Sinope, whose emir quickly surrendered. Then the sultan moved south across eastern Anatolia to neutralize Uzun Hasan. Having isolated Trebizond, Mehmed swept down upon it before the inhabitants knew he was coming, and placed it under siege. The city held out for a month before David surrendered on 15 August 1461. With the fall of Trebizond, the last independent remnant of the Byzantine Empire, as well as the Roman Empire from which the Byzantine Empire sprang, was the Empire of Trebizond&#x27;s offshoot, the Principality of Theodoro. On December 30, 1475, it would also fall to Ottoman rule.

== Culture ==
===Religion===
Christianity strongly influenced society in the Empire of Trebizond. According to the Acts of Vazelon, which were written by contemporary monks, most peasants in the Matzouka region of the Empire had first names relating to Christian religious figures. Last names often referred to Christian saints, trades, and place names.

In the relatively limited territory of the kingdom of the Grand Komnenoi (known as the &quot;Empire of Trebizond&quot;) there was enough room for three dioceses: Trebizond, which was the only diocese established far in the past, Cerasous and Rizaion in Lazika, both formed as upgraded bishoprics. All three dioceses survived the Ottoman conquest (1461) and generally operated until the 17th century, when the dioceses of Cerasous and Rizaion were abolished. The diocese of Rizaion and the bishopric of Of were abolished at the time due to the Islamisation of the Laz and of the region respectively. Possibly the diocese of Cerasous was deactivated for the same reasons.

== In popular culture ==
The Empire of Trebizond acquired a reputation in Western Europe for being &quot;enriched by the trade from Persia and the East that passed through its capital,&quot; according to Steven Runciman, &quot;and by the silver-mines in the hills behind, and famed for the beauty of its princesses.&quot; Donald Nicol echoes Runciman&#x27;s observations: &quot;Most of the emperors were blessed with a progeny of marriageable daughters, and the beauty of the ladies of Trebizond was as legendary as the wealth of their dowries.&quot; Its wealth and exotic location endowed a lingering fame on the polity. Cervantes described the eponymous hero of his &quot;Don Quixote&quot; as &quot;imagining himself for the valour of his arm already crowned at least Emperor of Trebizond.&quot; Rabelais had his character Picrochole, the ruler of Piedmont, declare: &quot;I want also to be Emperor of Trebizond.&quot; Other allusions and works set in Trebizond continue into the 20th century.

In Italian, there exists the expression &quot;to lose the Trebizond&quot; (&quot;perdere la Trebisonda&quot;) which means &quot;to be bewildered&quot;. Trebizond was a port reachable by all the routes that crossed the Black Sea, and therefore a safe shelter in case of storms.

<text>Olympic National Forest is a U.S. National Forest located in Washington, USA. With an area of , it nearly surrounds Olympic National Park and the Olympic Mountain range. Olympic National Forest contains parts of Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, and Mason counties. The landscape of the national forest varies, from the temperate Olympic rain forest to the salt water fjord of Hood Canal to the peaks of Mt. Washington.

Annual precipitation averages about , giving rise to streams such as the Humptulips River.

Olympic National Forest was originally created as Olympic Forest Reserve in 1897, then renamed to Olympic National Forest in 1907. A portion of the National Forest became the Mount Olympus National Monument in 1909, which was later designated Olympic National Park.

A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the Forest was . It is administered in two ranger districts: the Pacific Ranger District on the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, and the Hood Canal Ranger District on the east side.

Forest headquarters are located in Olympia, with ranger district offices in Forks, Quinault, and Quilcene. The former office in Hoodsport closed in 2005, and now houses a local Chamber of Commerce, which still sells Northwest Forest Passes.

Other Washington towns near entrances of the forest include Port Angeles, Sequim, and Amanda Park.

== Wild Olympics ==

The Wild Olympics campaign is an effort to designate additional areas on the Olympic Peninsula as protected.

Under a bill introduced by United States Senator Patty Murray in January 2014 logging on an additional 126,554 acres (20%) of the Olympic National Forest&#x27;s lands would be disallowed under the creation of nine new wilderness areas and expansion of the five existing ones. Wild and Scenic River designations would extend to 19 rivers, including those originating in the Olympic National Park, such as the Quinault, Hoh, Elwha, and Hamma Hamma, and some that do not, like the Middle Fork of the Satsop River. According to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, &quot;the wilderness designation would permanently protect old growth and ancient forest habitat throughout the region. The wild and scenic rivers designation would add federal recognition to the outstanding river systems on the peninsula, protecting them as a source of clean drinking water and helping to keep Puget Sound clean for generations. This designation does not restrict private property rights.&quot;

Like the Northern Spotted Owl controversy two decades earlier, the action has met opposition from some residents on and near the Olympic Peninsula who see it as a threat to their livelihoods. Handmade &quot;Stop Wild Olympics&quot; signs can be seen in the Aberdeen area and on the peninsula, expressing displeasure, and an opposition group, Working Wild Olympics, was set up in 2011. The effort has the support of dozens of &quot;major hunting and fishing organizations&quot; who see it as a way to sustain elk, salmon and other fish. Debate on the topic in 2014 has included community meetings drawing hundreds of individuals on both sides, and full-page advertisements in local newspapers.

An episode of &quot;This American Land&quot; concerning the Wild Olympics proposal showed nationally on PBS in 2014.

The Wild Olympics Wilderness and Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was reintroduced in 2019 as H.R.2642 and received a hearing in the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.

<text>Gifford Pinchot National Forest is a National Forest located in southern Washington, managed by the United States Forest Service. With an area of , it extends along the western slopes of Cascade Range from Mount Rainier National Park to the Columbia River. The forest straddles the crest of the South Cascades of Washington State, spread out over broad old-growth forests, high mountain meadows, several glaciers, and numerous volcanic peaks. The forest&#x27;s highest point is at at the top of Mount Adams, the second-tallest volcano in the state after Rainier. Often found abbreviated GPNF on maps and in texts, it includes the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, established by Congress in 1982.

==History==

Gifford Pinchot National Forest is one of the older national forests in the United States. Included as part of the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve in 1897, were set aside as the Columbia National Forest on July 1, 1908.

In 1855, the US government commissioned Washington Territory to negotiate land cession treaties with tribes around the forest. The Yakama tribe signed a treaty agreement that stipulated their moving to a reservation while maintaining off-reservation resource rights; however, the original treaty was then broken in 1916 when the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that Yakamas hunting off the reservation had to subscribe to state fish and game laws. Many tribes have continued to use the area&#x27;s resources while encountering non-Native hunters, fishers, and recreation users.

It was later renamed the Gifford Pinchot National Forest on June 15, 1949, in honor of Gifford Pinchot, one of the leading figures in the creation of the national forest system of the United States. His widow, fellow conservationist Cornelia Bryce Pinchot, was one of the speakers who addressed the audience assembled that day. In 1985 the non-profit Gifford Pinchot Task Force formed to promote conservation of the forest.

==Geography==

Gifford Pinchot National Forest is located in a mountainous region approximately between Mount St. Helens to the west, Mount Adams to the east, Mount Rainier National Park to the north, and the Columbia River to the south. This region of Southwest Washington is noted for its complex topography and volcanic geology. About 65 percent of the forest acreage is located in Skamania County. In descending order of land area the others are Lewis, Yakima, Cowlitz, and Klickitat counties.

=== Major rivers ===

The Pacific Northwest brings abundant rainfall to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, feeding an extensive network of rivers. The forest has only one river currently designated as Wild and Scenic, the White Salmon River, fed from glaciers high on Mount Adams. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest recommends adding four rivers to the Wild and Scenic System. They are the Lewis River, the Cispus River, the Clear Fork, and the Muddy Fork of the Cowlitz River. There are an additional thirteen rivers in the forest being studied for consideration into the National Wild and Scenic River System.

The following listed are the major streams and rivers of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Many of these provide excellent fishing.
* Cispus River
* Cowlitz River
* White Salmon River
* Little White Salmon River
* Wind River
* Lewis River
* Muddy River
* East Canyon Creek
* Skate Creek
* Iron Creek
* Trout Lake Creek
* Cultus Creek
* Quartz Creek
* Butter Creek
* Clear Creek
* Siouxon Creek
* Canyon Creek
* Johnson Creek

=== Major lakes ===
The Gifford Pinchot National Forest includes many popular and secluded backcountry lakes. Most of the lakes offer excellent fishing. Goose Lake is known for the best fishing in the State of Washington.

The following table lists the major lakes of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest:

==Congressional action==
Since 1964, Congressional action has established one national monument and seven wilderness areas in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.

=== National Monuments ===

On August 26, 1982, congressional action established the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, after the cataclysmic eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980.

=== Wilderness Areas ===
Congressional action since 1964 has established the following wilderness areas:
* Glacier View Wilderness – 
* Goat Rocks – , part of which lies in neighboring Wenatchee NF
* Indian Heaven – 20,782 acres (84.1 km2)
* Mount Adams – 47,078 acres (190.5 km2)
* Tatoosh – 15,725 acres (63.6 km2)
* Trapper Creek – 5,969 acres (24.2 km2)
* William O. Douglas – , most of which lies in neighboring Wenatchee NF
* The Shark Rock Wilderness was proposed in the mid-1970s by E.M. Sterling for the 75,000 acre Dark Divide Roadless Area in his book, &quot;The South Cascades&quot;. It is the largest unprotected roadless area (allowing motorized access) in the Washington Cascades, featuring sharp peaks, deep canyons, old-growth forests, and delicate subalpine meadows.

=== Points of interest ===
The forest also offers the following special areas and points of interest:
:* Dark Divide Roadless Area
:* Silver Star Scenic Area
:* Lava tubes, caves, and casts (notably the Ice Caves)
:* Ape Caves
:* Midway High Lakes Area
:* Big Lava Bed
:* Packwood Lake
:* Sawtooth Berry Fields, huckleberry fields reserved for Yakima tribe use. Designated in 1932 through a handshake agreement between forest supervisor J.R. Bruckart and Yakima Chief William Yallup.
:* Lone Butte Wildlife Emphasis Area
:* Layser Cave, a dwelling for Native Americans 7,000 years ago and a former archeological site.

==Forest Service management==
The forest supervisor&#x27;s office is located in Vancouver, Washington. There are local ranger district offices in Randle, Amboy, and Trout Lake. The forest is named after the first chief of the United States Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot. Washington towns near entrances of the forest include Cougar, Randle, Packwood, Trout Lake, and Carson.

In August 2024, the Williams Mine fire burned over 11,900 acres of land within the Gifford Pinchot forest. In response, firefighters with the Mount St. Helen&#x27;s Forest District deployed protective wrappings to preserve several historic buildings that were more than 100 years old. This included the Gotchen Creek Guard Station - the oldest building in the forest.

== Ecology ==
A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the Forest was , some of which is contained within its wilderness areas.
The Gifford Pinchot National Forest is the native habitat for several threatened species which include the spotted owl (threatened 2012) as well as multiple species of Northwest fish like the bull trout (threatened 1998), chinook salmon (threatened 2011), coho salmon (threatened 2011) and steelhead (threatened 2011).

People for over 6,000 years have made an impact on the ecology of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Native Americans hunted in high meadows below receding glaciers. The natives then began to manage the forest to meet their own needs. One method they used was to burn specific areas to help in the huckleberry production. About 338 spots, more than 6,000 culturally modified trees were identified, of which 3,000 are now protected. Archaeological investigations are supported by the United States Forest Service.

The forest was home to the Big Tree at the southern flank of Mt Adams, one of the world&#x27;s largest Ponderosa Trees.

== Huckleberry harvesting ==
Huckleberries have proven challenging to cultivate, preventing their commercial growth on farms. Consequently, they are harvested commercially each summer from wild populations. Gifford Pinchot National Forest operates the only large-scale commercial huckleberry harvesting program among the region&#x27;s national forests. Historically, treaties with Native American tribes protected huckleberry patches for tribal use; however, the berries have become valuable commercial commodities, prompting some to advocate for ending the commercial program. The increased activity of commercial harvesters has made it challenging to locate undisturbed, productive berry patches, which were once primarily utilized by local pickers.

In the National Forest, buyers purchase huckleberries from harvesters at $27.50 per gallon. The forest issues seasonal permits to commercial pickers, priced at $105, which allow a maximum harvest of 70 gallons. An alternative two-week permit costs $60, with no specified gallon limit. The forest sold 928 permits the previous year, generating a total revenue of $83,445.

<doc id="652660" wikidata="Q1186134" url="?curid=652660" title="Poncelet–Steiner theorem">
<text>In the branch of mathematics known as Euclidean geometry, the Poncelet–Steiner theorem is one of several results concerning compass and straightedge constructions having additional restrictions imposed on the traditional rules. This result, related to the rusty compass equivalence and to Steiner constructions, states that whatever can be constructed by straightedge and compass together can be constructed by straightedge alone, provided that a single circle and its centre are given:

: &quot;Any Euclidean construction, insofar as the given and required elements are points (or lines), if it can be completed with both the compass and the straightedge together, may be completed with the straightedge alone provided that no fewer than one circle with its center exist in the plane.&quot;

Though a compass can make constructions significantly easier, it is implied that there is no functional purpose of the compass once the first circle has been drawn. All constructions remain possible, though it is naturally understood that circles and their arcs cannot be drawn without the compass. All points that uniquely define a construction, which can be determined with the use of the compass, are equally determinable without, albeit with greater difficulty.

This means only that the compass may be used for aesthetic purposes, rather than for the purposes of construction. In other words, the compass may be used &quot;after&quot; all of the key points are determined, in order to &quot;fill-in&quot; the arcs purely for visual or artistic purposes, if it is desirable, and not as a necessary step toward construction. Nothing essential for the purposes of geometric construction is lost by neglecting the construction of circular arcs.

== History ==
In the tenth century, the Persian mathematician Abu al-Wafa&#x27; Buzjani (940−998) considered geometric constructions using a straightedge and a compass with a fixed opening, a so-called &quot;rusty compass&quot;. Constructions of this type appeared to have some practical significance as they were used by artists Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in Europe in the late fifteenth century. A new viewpoint developed in the mid sixteenth century when the size of the opening was considered fixed but arbitrary and the question of how many of Euclid&#x27;s constructions could be obtained was paramount.

Renaissance mathematician Lodovico Ferrari, a student of Gerolamo Cardano in a &quot;mathematical challenge&quot; against Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia was able to show that &quot;all of Euclid&quot; (that is, the straightedge and compass constructions in the first six books of Euclid&#x27;s Elements) could be accomplished with a straightedge and rusty compass. Within ten years additional sets of solutions were obtained by Cardano, Tartaglia and Tartaglia&#x27;s student Benedetti. During the next century these solutions were generally forgotten until, in 1673, Georg Mohr published (anonymously and in Dutch) &quot;Euclidis Curiosi&quot; containing his own solutions. Mohr had only heard about the existence of the earlier results and this led him to work on the problem.

Showing that &quot;all of Euclid&quot; could be performed with straightedge and rusty compass is not the same as proving that &quot;all&quot; straightedge and compass constructions could be done with a straightedge and just a rusty compass. Such a proof would require the formalization of what a straightedge and compass could construct. This groundwork was provided by Jean Victor Poncelet in 1822, having been motivated by Mohr&#x27;s work on the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem. He also conjectured and suggested a possible proof that a straightedge and rusty compass would be equivalent to a straightedge and compass, and moreover, the rusty compass need only be used once. The result of this theorem, that &quot;a straightedge and single circle with given centre is equivalent to a straightedge and compass&quot; was proved by Jakob Steiner in 1833.

Major contributions to the field were made by Lazare Carnot, Karl von Staudt, Giuseppe Peano, and others in the mid-to-late 19th and early 20th centuries, including contributions by Francesco Severi as late as the mid 20th century, even as further research is ongoing.

== Related constructs ==

Related constructs that link to this article.

=== Steiner constructions ===
The term Steiner construction typically refers to any geometric construction that utilizes the straightedge tool only, and is sometimes simply called a &quot;straightedge-only construction&quot;, named for Jakob Steiner who studied the subject. As a restricted construction paradigm, no stipulations are made about what geometric objects already exist in the plane or their relative placement; any such conditions are postulated ahead of time. Also, no implications are made about what is or is not possible to construct. Constructions carried out in adherence with the Poncelet-Steiner theorem - relying solely on the use of a straightedge tool without the aid of a compass - are therefore a particular subset of &quot;Steiner constructions&quot;.

Whereas Steiner constructions study the straightedge tool, the Poncelet-Steiner theorem stipulates the existence of a circle with its center, and affirms that a single circle is equivalent to a compass. Broadly, Steiner constructions may involve any number of circles, including none, already drawn in the plane, with or without their centers. They may also involve all manner of unique shapes and curves preexisting in the plane, provided that the straightedge tool is the only physical tool at the geometer&#x27;s disposal.

Therefore, all constructions adhering to the Poncelet-Steiner theorem are Steiner constructions, though not all Steiner constructions abide by the strict condition of there being only one circle with its center provided in the plane. The Poncelet-Steiner theorem does not require an actual compass - it is presumed that the circle preexists in the plane - therefore all constructions herein demonstrating the Poncelet-Steiner theorem are Steiner constructions. The single arbitrary circle (with its center), which is postulated in the Poncelet-Steiner theorem, is therefore the minimal amount of information required to allow Steiner constructions to recover the constructive power and versatility of the traditional compass-straightedge paradigm.

=== Rusty compass ===
The rusty compass describes a compass whose hinge is so rusted as to be fused such that its legs - the needle and pencil - are unable to adjust width. In essence, it is a compass whose distance is fixed, and which draws circles of a predetermined and constant, but arbitrary radius. Circles may be drawn centered at any arbitrary point, but the radius is unchangeable.

As a restricted construction paradigm, the &quot;rusty compass constructions&quot; allow the use of a straightedge and the fixed-width compass. The rusty compass equivalence:

:&quot;All points necessary to uniquely describe any compass-straightedge construction may be achieved with a straightedge and fixed-width compass.&quot;

It is naturally understood that the arbitrary-radius compass may be used for aesthetic purposes; only the arc of one specific predetermined fixed-width compass may be used for construction.

==== As the rusty compass relates to the theorem ====
In some sense, the rusty compass is a generalization and simplification of the Poncelet-Steiner theorem. Though not more powerful, it is certainly more convenient. The Poncelet-Steiner theorem requires a single circle with arbitrary radius and center point to be placed in the plane. As it is the only drawn circle, whether or not it was drawn by a rusty compass is immaterial and equivalent. The benefit of general rusty compass constructions, however, is that the compass may be used repeatedly to redraw circles centered at any desired point, albeit with the same radius, thus simplifying many constructions. Naturally if all constructions are possible with a single circle arbitrarily placed in the plane, then the same can surely be said about a straightedge and rusty compass, with which at least one circle may be arbitrarily placed. 

It is known that a straightedge and a rusty compass is sufficient to construct all that is possible with straightedge and standard compass - with the implied understanding that circular arcs of arbitrary radii cannot be drawn, and only need be drawn for aesthetic purposes rather than constructive ones. Historically this was proven when the Poncelet-Steiner theorem was proven, which is a stronger result. The rusty compass, therefore, is no weaker than the Poncelet-Steiner theorem. It should also be intuitively clear that a rusty compass cannot be any stronger than a standard compass. As the rusty compass is at least as strong as the circle and no stronger than the standard compass, and the latter two are proven equivalent by the Poncelet-Steiner theorem, so too must the rusty compass be equivalent.

The Poncelet-Steiner theorem reduces Ferrari&#x27;s rusty compass equivalence, a claim at the time, to a single-use compass:
:&quot;All points necessary to uniquely describe any compass-straightedge construction may be achieved with only a straightedge, once the first circle has been placed.&quot;
The Poncelet-Steiner theorem takes the rusty compass scenario, and breaks the compass completely after its first use.

There is a subtle distinction, however, which makes the single use rusty compass slightly more useful. With a single-use compass, the geometer may place the first circle arbitrarily, as it suits convenience, even after other constructions have begun. The Poncelet-Steiner theorem, on the other hand, presumes the geometer has no control over the placement of the circle or over the constructions undertaken, making the two independent.

== Associated concepts and vocabulary ==

Various other notions, tools, terminology, etc., is often associated (sometimes loosely) to the Poncelet-Steiner theorem. Some are listed here.

=== Projective geometry, as it relates to the Poncelet-Steiner Theorem ===
Projective geometry is the study of the geometric properties that are invariant under projective transformations. Though a distinct topic in its own right, many of the concepts of projective geometry are applied here to Steiner constructions. Jean-Victor Poncelet was a major contributor to the subject when he postulated the theorem of this article, which Jakob Steiner later proved. Many of the related concepts developed in projective geometry include but are not limited to: concurrence, &quot;points at infinity&quot;, perspective and perspectivity, projectivity, ratios and cross-ratios, conjugates, stable or fixed points of involutions, invariants, duality, homogeneity and homography, linear transformations, projective harmonics, pencils (of lines or of circles), and others. A thorough treatment of Steiner constructions and their proofs require a background in projective geometry, though the subject of projective geometry is not restricted to straightedge-only constructions.

=== Points at Infinity ===
Points at infinity are a rather abstract notion found in projective geometry. Also called &quot;ideal points&quot;, they refer to the &quot;endpoint&quot; of a line: the point where the line intersects the horizon of the plane. Rather than a coordinate, they are identified by a direction; any line therefore identifies a point at infinity. All parallel lines share in the same ideal point, and thus any two parallel lines are said to intersect at the same point at infinity, akin to Euclid&#x27;s conception of parallels intersecting. As each direction in the plane identifies a distinct point at infinity, the collection of these are called the &quot;line at infinity&quot;, which may also in some contexts be viewed as a circle of infinite radius with no definable center. In some sense these points &quot;complete&quot; the plane; the notion is vital to transforming the traditional Euclidean plane (an affine space) into a projective space. It is through the notion of points at infinity that many Steiner constructions become possible, provable, and fully generalized.

=== Pencils of lines or of circles ===

The term pencil refers to a set of geometric objects that all share in a common property which is uniquely identifiable by precisely two of its elements, and is a term usually only employed in geometric contexts. The property in question is usually expressed as a geometric object also. For example, in the case of a &quot;pencil of lines&quot;, the property is typically that of passing through the same point, also called concurrence. Two lines will intersect at a point - even if the point is &quot;at infinity&quot; in the case of parallel lines - where the point of concurrence (i.e. intersection) is the geometric object defining the property; any other line that also intersects at the same point is therefore in the pencil, and conversely those lines that do not are not in the pencil.

In the case of a &quot;pencil of circles&quot;, a common coaxial system - that is, having the same radical axis (which is a line) - is the usual interpretation. Any other circle is included in the pencil if it shares the same radical axis with any other pair of circles already in the pencil. Indeed, a &quot;pencil of points&quot; typically refers to the set of all points on a given line, as any and every two points from this set will define the same line.

Though these are the usual meanings, any property the geometer chooses is valid, provided that it takes two elements - no more or less - to establish the underlying set. In essence, a pencil is an entire set of (potentially infinite) geometric objects which are wholly defined by any two, and every two, distinct members from its set. Any two like-objects therefore define the entire set to which other like-objects do or do not belong.

Pencils are a common theme in many geometry publications throughout history, though the term is less commonly used today. This article does not explicitly refer to pencils, though some of the constructions found herein, and in projective geometry more broadly, do in fact implicitly use the notion of a pencil, often by different terminology or by explicitly referring to the underlying property. The term is herein defined due to its common usage within many of the cited references supporting the content of this article, wherein the term is rarely defined.

==== Generalizations of the pencil ====
Pencils have been generalized to higher dimensions as well (e.g. a &quot;pencil of planes&quot;). For contrast, the term &quot;flat pencil&quot; refers to pencils in a two-dimensional space, and &quot;spatial pencil&quot; for three-dimensions.

The notion of pencils can also be generalized such that more than two elements establish the set. A set of geometric objects defined by precisely three of its elements, no more or less, is called a &quot;bundle&quot;. One example of a &quot;bundle of points&quot; is the set of points on the arc of a circle. Similarly, though there is no specialized term for it, five points in the plane define a conic section, any five points on which may be used to establish the same curve.

== Steiner&#x27;s theorem / Hilbert&#x27;s error ==
: &quot;Not to be confused for &quot;Steiner&#x27;s parallel axis theorem&quot;, &quot;Steiner&#x27;s porism&quot;, or the &quot;Steiner–Lehmus theorem&quot;.

If only one circle is to be given and no other special information, Steiner&#x27;s theorem implies that the center of the circle must be provided along with the arc of the circle. This is done by proving the impossibility of constructing the circle&#x27;s center from straightedge alone using only a single circle in the plane, without its center. An argument using projective transformations and Steiner&#x27;s conic sections is used.

: &quot; With only one circle provided in the plane, its center cannot be constructed by straightedge alone.&quot;

Also attributed to David Hilbert and known as &quot;Hilbert&#x27;s Error&quot;, a naïve summary of the proof is as follows. With the use of a straightedge tool, only linear projective transformations are possible, and linear projective transformations are reversible operations. Lines project onto lines under any linear projective transformation, while conic sections project onto conic sections under a linear projective transformation, but the latter are skewed such that eccentricities, foci, and centers of circles are not preserved. Under different sequences of mappings, the center does not map uniquely and reversibly. This would not be the case if lines could be used to determine a circle&#x27;s center. As linear transformations are reversible operations and would thus produce unique results, the fact that unique results are not possible implies the impossibility of center-point constructions. The uniqueness of the constructed center would depend on additional information - not provided by a single circle - which would make the construction reversible.

Thus, it is not possible to construct everything that can be constructed by straightedge and compass using only the straightedge alone. Consequently, requirements on the Poncelet-Steiner theorem cannot be weakened with respect to the circle center. If the centre of the only given circle is not provided, it cannot be obtained by a straightedge alone. Many constructions are impossible with straightedge alone. Something more is necessary, and a circle with its center identified is sufficient.

=== Alternative Frameworks to the Single Circle with Center ===
Alternatively, the center may be omitted with sufficient additional information. This is not a weakening of the Poncelet-Steiner theorem, merely an alternative framework. Nor is it a contradiction of Steiner&#x27;s Theorem which hypothesizes only a single circle. The inclusion of this sufficient alternative information, which in most cases includes at least two circles, disambiguates the mappings under the projective transformations, thus allowing various Steiner constructions to recover the circle center.

Most of these alternatives requires at least two circles devoid of their centers, plus some other unique piece of information. Some alternatives include two concentric or two intersecting circles, or three circles, or other variations wherein the provided circles are devoid of their centers. In each, some additional unique-but-sufficient criterion is met, such as concentricity, intersection points, a third circle, etc., respectively. Other configurations exist (see a later section for a more detailed list), such as some one-circle configurations, where sufficient alternative information is provided. In any of these cases, the center of a circle can be constructed, thereby reducing the problem to the Poncelet-Steiner theorem hypothesis (with the added convenience of having additional circles in the plane, all of whose centers may now be constructed).

==Constructive proof outline==
To prove the theorem, each of the basic constructions of compass and straightedge need to be proven to be possible by using a straightedge alone (provided that a circle and its center exist in the plane), as these are the foundations of, or elementary steps for, all other constructions. That is to say, all constructions can be written as a series of steps involving these five basic constructions:

#Creating the line through two existing points.
#Creating the circle through one point with centre another point.
#Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing, non-parallel lines.
#Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect).
#Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect).

If these fundamentals can be achieved with only a straightedge and an arbitrary circle (with center) embedded in the plane, the claim that is the theorem of this article will have been proved.

#1 – A line through two points

This can be done with a straightedge alone. Neither a compass nor a circle is required.

#2 – A circle through one point with defined center

It is understood that the arc of a circle cannot be drawn without a compass. A circle is considered to be given by any two points, one defining the center and one existing on the circumference at radius. Any such pair define a unique circle, although the converse is not true: for any given circle there is no unique pair defining it. In keeping with the intent of the theorem which we aim to prove, the actual circle need not be drawn but for aesthetic reasons. It is the claim of this theorem that a circle defined in this way is sufficient and fully useful for construction, even without its arc drawn. Thus, we may take construction #2 as proved if the other four are achievable. This claim will be revisited later in the article.

#3 – Intersection of two lines

This construction can also be done directly with a straightedge.
#4, #5 – Intersections involving the circle

Thus, to prove the theorem, only constructions #4 and #5 need be proven possible using only a straightedge and a given circle with its center.

== Notes and Caveats for the Constructive Proof ==
Some notes and commentary regarding the theorem, the proofs, and related topics of consideration follow.

=== Regarding the Circle ===

Circle nomenclature

In the constructions below, a circle defined by a center point and a point on its circumference, , through which the arc of the circle passes (or would pass if compass-drawn), is denoted . As most circles are not compass-drawn, center and circumference points are named explicitly. The arc, if drawn, may also be named, such as &quot;circle&quot; or &quot;arc&quot; . Per the theorem, when a compass-drawn circle is provided it is simply referred to as the &quot;given circle&quot; or the &quot;provided circle&quot;. Every compass-drawn circle is interchangeable for the purposes of this theorem.

Circle generality

The provided circle should always be assumed to be placed arbitrarily in the plane with an arbitrary radius. Many examples of constructability with a straightedge one may find in various references on and offline, will presume that the circle is not placed in general position. Instead, for example, the constructability of a polygon may postulate that the circle is circumscribing. Such assumptions simplify a construction but does not prove generality of the claim of constructability. For the purposes of this theorem, we may assume that the circle is indeed fully general: the center point and radius are completely arbitrary and purely independent of all other points in the plane.

Usage of the arc of the provided circle(s)

The intersection points between any line and the given circle (or given arc of a circle) may be found directly, as can the intersection points between the arcs of two circles, if provided. The Poncelet-Steiner Theorem does not prohibit the normal treatment of circles already drawn in the plane; normal construction rules apply. The theorem only prohibits the construction of new circular arcs with a compass.

=== Regarding Application ===

Usability

The constructive proof does not merely serve as a proof of the theorem, but also demonstrates the practical application of the most basic constructions, such that the claim of constructability with a straightedge could be employed in practice, in the most general case. Since all geometric constructions can be expressed as a sequence of the five basic constructive steps, and the below constructions demonstrate and justify each of these, necessarily, in order to prove the theorem, therefore all possible constructions may be implemented accordingly.

Generality and simplicity

Some specific construction goals - such as for example the construction of a square - may potentially have relatively simple construction solutions, which will not be demonstrated here in the article, despite its simplicity. The omission of such constructions mitigate the length of the article. The purpose of these decisions is that such constructions may not be ubiquitous or sufficiently useful, particularly for the purposes of proving the theorem. Though the theorem and the constructions found herein can be used to construct any figure, no claims are made about the existence of simpler (straightedge-only) alternatives for any specific construction, or given any specific set of initial starting conditions.

Arbitrary point placement

Steiner constructions and those constructions herein proving the Poncelet-Steiner theorem require the arbitrary placement of points in space. These constructions rely on the concept of fixed points (and fixed lines), wherein the resultant construction is independent of the arbitrariness employed during construction. These are known as transformation invariants. In some construction paradigms - such as in the geometric definition of the constructible number - arbitrary point placement may be prohibited. Traditional geometry has no such restriction on point placement. With such a restriction against the placement of arbitrary points, the single circle is indeed weaker than the compass. This can be reconciled, however. Steiner constructions may be used as a basis for the set of constructible numbers if one only enters into the set those points which are fixed/invariant, disregarding the arbitrarily placed points, and the unfixed/variant points they derive, that are required during a construction.

=== Regarding the Proof and Approach ===

Doubts about constructions #1 or #3: defining lines and intersecting them

Any doubts about constructions #1 or #3 would apply equally to the traditional construction paradigms which do involve the compass, and thus are not concerns unique to the Poncelet-Steiner theorem or to Steiner constructions more generally. These concerns are in fact intrinsic to the straightedge itself, and have broad ramifications for traditional geometry beyond the scope of straightedge-only constructions. Their justifications - if any need be given - will not be explored in this specialized article, but would be more suited to the geometry article.

Doubts about construction #2: defining and constructing circles

Construction #2 should not be of concern. Even though it is undisputed that a unique circle is defined by a center point and a point on its circumference, the pertinent question is whether or not this is sufficient information for the purposes of straightedge-only construction, or if the drawn arc is required. As per the fundamental constructions, the arc of the circle is only ever used in traditional construction paradigms for the purposes of circle-circle and circle-line intersections, therein the arc of the circle is used directly to identify intersection points. Thus if constructions #4 and #5 are satisfiable without the arc of the circle with which to intersect, then it will prove the non-necessity of drawing the arc. This would therefore imply that construction #2 is effectively satisfied by a simple labeling of two points, identifying the unique circle. This claim will be revisited later in this article.

Choice of construction among variants

In general constructions there are often several variations that will produce the same result. The choices made in such a variant can be made without loss of generality. However, when a construction is being used to prove that something can be done, it is not necessary to describe all these various choices and, for the sake of clarity of exposition, only one variant will be given below. This serves as both proof of possibility and demonstration of methodology. The variants chosen below are done so for their ubiquity and generalizability in application rather than their simplicity or convenience under any particular set of special conditions.

Alternative proofs

Alternative proofs do exist for the Poncelet-Steiner theorem, originating in an algebraic approach to geometry. Relying on equations and numerical values in real coordinate space, formula_1, via an isomorphism to the Euclidean plane, this is a fairly modern interpretation which requires the notions of length, distance, and coordinate positions to be imported into the plane. The algebraic proof illustrates the dependence of the theorem on Archimedes&#x27; axiom, which cannot be formulated in first-order logic. This is well beyond the scope of traditional geometry. This article takes a more traditional approach and proves the theorem using pure geometric constructive techniques, which also showcases the practical application.

== Constructive proof ==
The proof of the theorem and useful straightedge-only constructions follow.

=== Some preliminary constructions ===
To prove the above constructions #4 and #5, which are included below, a few necessary intermediary constructions are also explained below since they are used and referenced frequently. These are also straightedge-only constructions. All constructions below rely on basic constructions #1,#2,#3, and any other construction that is listed prior to it. 

==== Parallel of a line having a colinear bisected segment ====
This construction does not require the use of the given circle. Naturally any line that passes through the center of the given circle implicitly has a bisected segment: the diameter is bisected by the center. The animated GIF file embedded at the introduction to this article demonstrates this construction - relying on the bisected diameter; the arc of the circle is never used - which is reiterated here without the circle and with enumerated steps.
Given an arbitrary line (in black) on which there exist two points and , having a midpoint between them, and an arbitrary point in the plane (assumed not to be on line ) through which a parallel of line is to be made:
# Construct a line (in red).

In some literature the bisected line segment is sometimes viewed as a one-dimensional &quot;circle&quot; existing on the line. Alternatively, some literature views the bisected line segment as a two dimensional circle in three dimensional space with the line passing through a diameter, but not parallel to the plane, thus intersecting the plane of construction at two points on the circumference with the midpoint simply being the prescribed circle center.

This construction is a special case of the projective harmonic conjugate construction, which is not demonstrated in this article.

==== Creating a bisected segment on a line ====
If the line passes through the center of a circle, the segment defined by the diameter through the circle is bisected by the center of the circle. In the general case, however, any other line in the plane may have a bisected segment constructed onto it. This construction does require the use of the given circle.

Given a line, (in black), and a circle centered at , we wish to create points , , and on the line such that is the midpoint:
# Draw an arbitrary line (in red) passing through the given circle&#x27;s center, , and the desired midpoint (chosen arbitrarily) on the line .
#* Notice that the red line, , passes through the center of the circle and highlights a diameter, bisected by the circle center. Any parallel may be made from this line according to the previous construction.
# Choose an arbitrary point on the given circle
#* For convenience the point should not lie on the perpendicular of line through the circle center.
# Construct a line (in orange), passing through , that is parallel to the red line .
#* If point is on the perpendicular of through the circle center, the parallel would be a tangent to the circle. The construction is possible by other means not listed in this article, but it is also unnecessary to choose such a point.
#* This parallel intersects the given circle at .
#* This parallel also intersects the black line at , defining one end of the line segment.
# Create two lines (in green), and , that each pass through the given circle&#x27;s center.
#* These green lines intersect the given circle at points and , respectively.
# Line (in blue) intersects the line at , defining the other endpoint of the line segment.
#* Segment now exists coincident with line and having midpoint .

As point is chosen arbitrarily, there is no need for it to inconveniently be on the perpendicular of line through the circle center. If however it is, line is merely the tangent line to the circle through point , which is coincident to point . This construction is possible though the construction is not listed in this article. Points and may be constructed as before, and will also equal one another. And again, line is merely the tangent line to the circle at that point. Thus points , and their midpoint may be found, as before, with only a minor change adding a subconstruction.

==== Constructing a parallel of any line ====

This construction does require the use of the given circle. In order to generalize the parallel line construction to all possible lines, not just the ones with a collinear bisected line segment, it becomes necessary to have additional information. In keeping with the Poncelet-Steiner theorem, a circle (with center) is the object of choice for this construction. 

To construct a parallel line of any given line, through any point in the plane, we trivially combine two constructions:
# Any line from which a parallel is to be made must have a bisected segment constructed onto it, if one does not already exist.
# A parallel is then constructed according to the previous parallel construction involving the collinear bisected segment.

In alternative constructions, which are not demonstrated in this article, a parallel may be constructed from any pair of lines which are already parallel to one another; thus a third parallel may be produced from any two, without the use of a circle. Additionally, a parallel of any line may be constructed whenever there exists in the plane any parallelogram, also without the use of a given circle.

==== Constructing a perpendicular line ====

This construction does require the use of the given circle and takes advantage of Thales&#x27;s theorem. 

From a given line , and a given point in the plane, a perpendicular to the line is to be constructed through the point. Provided is the given circle .
# If the desired line from which a perpendicular is to be made, , does not pass through the given circle - as is depicted - or it also passes through the given circle&#x27;s center, then a new parallel line (in red) may be constructed arbitrarily such that it does pass through the given circle but not its center, and the perpendicular is to be made from this line instead.
# This red line which passes through the given circle but not its center, will intersect the given circle in two points, and .
# Draw a line (in orange), through the circle center.
#* This line intersects the given circle at point .
#* Angle is 180°.
# Draw a line (in light green).
#* This line is perpendicular to the red (and therefore the black) lines, and .
#* By Thales&#x27;s Theorem, angle is 90°.
# Construct a parallel of line through point using previous constructions.
#* A perpendicular of the original black line, , now exists in the plane, line .
#* A parallel of any line may be constructed through any point in the plane.

If the line from which a perpendicular is to be made does pass through the circle center, an alternative approach would be to construct the tangent lines to the circle at the lines points of intersection, using Steiner constructions. This is not demonstrated in this article.

Another option in the event the line passes through the circle&#x27;s center would be to construct a parallel to it through the circle at an arbitrary point. An isosceles trapezoid (or potentially an isosceles triangle) is formed by the intersection points to the circle of both lines. The two non-parallel sides of which may be extended to an intersection point between them, and a line drawn from there through the circle&#x27;s center. This line is perpendicular, and the diameter is bisected by the center.

By an alternative construction not demonstrated in this article, a perpendicular of any line may be constructed without a circle, provided there exists in the plane any square.

==== Constructing the midpoint of any segment (segment bisection) ====
Given is a line segment , which is to be bisected. Optionally, a parallel line exists in the plane.

# If the line , which is parallel to line segment , does not exist in the plane then it must be constructed according to earlier constructions using the given circle in the plane (not depicted).
#* A given circle in the plane is not required for this construction if the parallel already exists.
#* The parallel may be placed in the plane arbitrarily, so long as it is not collinear with the line segment.
# Arbitrarily choose a point in the plane which is not collinear with the line or the line segment.
#* One may, alternatively, construct point as the intersection of lines and , provided that points and already exist on a parallel line .
# Draw a line (in red), intersecting line at point .
# Draw a line (in orange), intersecting line at point .
# Draw two lines, and (each in light green), intersecting each other at point 
# Draw a line (in blue), intersecting segment at point .
#* Point is the desired midpoint of segment .
#* Line also bisects segment 

For added perspective, in some sense this construction is a variant of a previous construction of a parallel from a bisected line segment, and is therefore also a special case of the projective harmonic conjugate (not provided in this article). It is the same set of lines when taken on whole, but constructed in a different order, and from a different initial set of conditions, arriving at a different end goal.

Since any arbitrary segment on one of two parallel lines can be bisected, and any line with a bisected segment on it may have a parallel constructed, the two scenarios are geometrically equivalent propositions. They imply one another; a simple construction can convert one scenario into the other using no additional information.

It may also be worth noting that if trapezoid is an isosceles trapezoid then the bisector is also a perpendicular bisector. An isosceles trapezoid is formed when lines and each pass through a circle and intersecting at those defining points, and in which case the perpendicular bisector is a centerline to the circle. If line is itself a centerline then a circle center has been found, if it was not already known.

Additionally, if is a parallelogram then the construction will fail as it is written. Point may be found normally, but point will not exist. Instead the bisecting line can be constructed as a parallel of lines or through point . However, in an alternate construction, any line segment may be bisected whenever a parallelogram exists in the plane (not demonstrated in this article).

==== Rotating a line segment ====
Line segment rotation is a useful construction but may rarely be used in practice. It is necessary to demonstrate in order to fully generalize the theorem.

To define a circle only the center and one point - any point - on the circumference is required. In principle a new point is constructed such that circle is equal to circle , though the point is not equal to point . In essence, segment is rotated about the axis point , to , for a different set of defining points for the same circle. 

One way of going about this which satisfies most conditions is as follows:
# Draw the line segment (in black).
# Construct a parallel (in red) of line through the center, point , of the given circle.
#* The parallel intersects the given circle at some point .
# Choose a point arbitrarily on the given circle not colinear with line .
# Draw a line (in orange).
# Construct a parallel line to through point (in magenta).
# Draw a line (in light green), connecting the points on the circles circumference.
# Construct a parallel of line through point (in blue).
# Intersect the blue and pink parallels, from points and , respectively.
#* This is point .
#* Point is the desired point, rotating the line segment and defining the same circle centered at .

This construction will fail if the desired rotation is diametrically opposite the circle (i.e. a half-circle rotation). One solution to this scenario is to employ two separate rotation constructions, neither one a half-circle rotation from the previous, one acting as an intermediary step. Choose any rotation angle arbitrarily, complete the rotation, then choose the supplementary angle and perform the rotation a second time.

There does exist a second, alternative rotation construction solution, based on projections and perspective points. Though it avoids the aforementioned half-circle rotation complication, it does have its own complications, which are similarly resolved with intermediary rotation constructions. The construction is no more versatile. It is not demonstrated in this article.

==== Constructing the radical axis between circles ====

This construction does require the use of the given circle (which is not depicted) for the sub-constructions referenced in the steps below, which were previously demonstrated.

Suppose two circles and are implicitly given, defined only by the points , , , and in the plane, with their centers defined, but are not compass-constructed. The radical axis, line (in dark blue), between the two circles may be constructed:
# Draw a line (in orange) through the circle centers.
# Draw a line segment (in red) between the points on the circumference of the circles.
# Find the midpoint, , of segment .
# Draw lines and (both in light green), connecting the segment midpoint with each of the circle centers.
# Construct a line (in purple) passing through point , and perpendicular to .
#* Line is the radical axis between circle and circle , as it passes through the point of intersection and is perpendicular to the line through centers, .
# Construct a line (in dark green) passing through point , and perpendicular to .
#* Line is the radical axis between circle and circle .
# Lines and intersect at point .
#* If the lines and are parallel then the segment midpoint is on the line - the centers of circles , , and are colinear - and the construction will fail. An alternative approach is required (see below).
#* Point is the power center between circles , , and , and therefore is the unique point that lies on the radical axis between any two of the three circles.
#* By transitivity, therefore, point exists on the radical axis between circles and .
# Construct a line (in dark blue) perpendicular to line and passing through point .
#* Line is the desired radical axis.

In the event that the construction of the radical axis fails due to there not being an intersection point between parallel lines and , which results from the coincidental placement of the midpoint on the line , an alternative approach is required. One such approach is to rotate the segment about the axis point (the center of circle ). Once arrived at the arbitrary rotation , which defines the same circle, the radical axis construction can begin anew without issue.

=== Intersecting a line with a circle (Construction #4) ===

This construction does require the use of the provided circle, . Any line may be naturally intersected with any compass-drawn circle.

Given is the line (in black) and the circle , which is not compass-constructed. The intersection points of the circle and the line , which are point and , may be constructed:
# Draw a line (in red) through the points defining the circle.
#* If point is colinear with line then segment will need to be rotated about the center point of the circle, and this construction restarted anew.
# Construct a parallel (in orange) of line through the center of the provided circle.
#* The parallel intersects the provided circle at two points, one of which is arbitrarily chosen: .
# Draw a line (in light green), through the centers of the two circles (i.e. the one provided by compass construction and the one which is to be intersected).
# Draw a line (in light blue), connecting the two points on the circumferences of the two circles.
# Intersect the lines and at point .
#* If point does not exist due to lines and being parallel - which results from circles and having equal radii - then refer back to step 2 and choose the alternate point of intersection, .
# Choosing a point arbitrarily on line , such that it is not on line , draw a line (in magenta).
#* For construction simplicity and only if line is not parallel to line , lines and may be coincident.
# Draw a line (in brown).
# Construct a parallel (in dark purple) of line through the center of the provided circle.
#* The parallel intersects the line at a point .
# Construct a parallel (in yellow) of line through the point .
#* The parallel intersects the provided circle at points and .
#* If the parallel does not intersect the provided circle then neither does the line intersect circle .
# Draw lines and (both in dark blue).
#* These lines both intersect line at points and , respectively.
# Points and are the desired points of intersection between the line and the circle .

=== Intersecting two circles (Construction #5) ===
The intersection between two circles becomes a trivial combination of two earlier constructions:
# Construct the radical axis between the two circles.
# Construct the intersection points between the radical axis and either one of the two circles arbitrarily chosen.
#* The radical axis is a line, so this construction is possible per the previous circle-line intersection construction (basic construction #4). 
# These points are the desired points of intersection of the circles.
#* The two circles and the radical axis all intersect at the same loci of points: two points, one point if tangential, or none if they do not intersect.
#* If the radical axis does not intersect one circle then it intersects neither, and neither do the two circles intersect.

=== A circle through one point centered at another point (Construction #2, revisited) ===

The second basic construction - describing a full circle with just its center and one point at radius defining circumference - never needed an arc to be constructed with the compass in order for the circle to be utilized in constructions. Namely, the intersections of circles both with circles and with lines, which together are the essence of all constructions involving a circle, are achievable without the arc. That is, any circle defined by a center point and a point on its circumference may be intersected by any line and by any other similarly-defined circle; nothing is lost by omitting the arc. Rather than directly intersecting lines and circles with an arc of a circle, as would have been done in traditional geometry, intersections have been shown to be constructible using the straightedge in an indirect manner. Thus defining a circle by its center and by any arbitrary point on its circumference is sufficient to fully describe the entire circle and utilize it in constructions. As such, the arc only serves an aesthetic purpose. Basic construction #2 is satisfied.

=== Conclusion ===

Since all five basic constructions have been shown to be achievable with only a straightedge, provided that a single circle with its center is placed in the plane, this proves the Poncelet-Steiner theorem. Any compass-straightedge construction may be achieved with the straightedge alone by describing their constructive steps in terms of the five basic constructions, and then utilizing the constructions in the above proof, if a circle with its center point is provided anywhere in the plane.

== Practical Application ==
The Poncelet-Steiner theorem is a fundamental result in projective geometry that has significant practical applications for geometers and mathematicians. It serves greater purpose than merely being purely academic, recreational, or a novelty. For practicing geometers, understanding this theorem is crucial as it demonstrates the power of projective techniques and provides alternative methods for solving classical construction problems, as well as broader insights.

The practical applications of the Poncelet-Steiner theorem extend beyond pure mathematics. In fields such as computer graphics and computational geometry, it offers efficient algorithms for geometric constructions without the need for more direct and lengthy approaches. This can lead to more streamlined and robust software implementations. Additionally, the theorem has implications in architectural design and engineering, where it can simplify certain drafting and modeling processes, and lending itself to improved design and modeling techniques. Often coordinates may be calculated using a sequence of linear equations, rather than the square roots associated with a circle, enabling faster, more accurate, and more numerically stable computation. In fact, Paul Dirac applied projective geometry in his contribution to the development of quantum mechanics.

Not only does the theorem have historical significance, but it, as well as projective geometry more broadly, also offers deeper insight into the nature of geometric constructions and the relationships between different geometric tools and geometric structures. It challenges conventional thinking about what is necessary for geometric constructions and opens the geometer up to new avenues for problem-solving. Mastering the insights of projective geometry enhances a geometer&#x27;s ability to approach problems from multiple perspectives, fostering creativity and versatility in their work.

== Other types of restricted construction ==
=== Restricted constructions involving the compass ===
&quot;Compass-Only Constructions&quot;

The Poncelet–Steiner theorem can be contrasted with the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem, which states that any compass and straightedge construction can be performed with only a compass. The straightedge is not required but for aesthetic purposes; nothing else is needed in the plane. Constructions carried out using only the compass are often called &quot;Mascheroni constructions&quot;, or simply &quot;compass-only constructions&quot;.

&quot; Rusty Compass &quot;

The rusty compass restriction allows the use of a compass and straightedge, provided that the compass produces circles of fixed radius. Although the rusty compass constructions were explored since the 10th century, and all of Euclid was shown to be constructable with a rusty compass by the 17th century, the Poncelet-Steiner theorem proves that the rusty compass and straightedge together are more than sufficient for any and all Euclidean construction. Indeed, the rusty compass becomes a tool simplifying constructions over merely the straightedge and single circle. Viewed the other way, the Poncelet-Steiner theorem not only fixes the width of the rusty compass, but ensures that the compass breaks after its first use.

&quot; Rigid versus Collapsing Compass&quot;

The compass equivalence theorem proves that the rigid compass (also called the modern compass) - one that holds its spacing when lifted from the plane - is equivalent to the traditional collapsing compass (also called divider) - one that does not retain its spacing, thus &quot;resetting to zero&quot;, every time it is lifted from the plane. The ability to transfer distances (i.e. construct congruent circles, translate a circle in the plane) - an operation made trivial by the fixable aperture of a rigid compass - was proven by Euclid to be possible with the collapsing compass. Consequently, the rigid compass and the collapsing compass are equivalent; what can be constructed by one can be constructed by the other.

Moreover, circle translation can be done using &quot;only&quot; the collapsing compass, without the straightedge tool. Since the compasses are equivalent even in the compass-only construction paradigm, the equivalence is not dependent on the straightedge to supplement the collapsing compass. The equivalence, therefore, is fundamental to the compasses themselves and to the properties of circle geometry. In the compass-only paradigm, additionally, the operation of circle translation requires no more than three additional circles (applications of the compass) over that of the rigid compass, and so it is a trivial matter.

It is valid to point out that the ability to translate circles with a collapsing compass is, in some sense, a purer result. It proves that the operation can be achieved in an abstract way, retained in the geometry of circles, rather than as a feature of a physical tool designed for purpose and transcendent the plane.

=== Restricted Steiner constructions ===
The requirement placed on the Poncelet-Steiner theorem - that one circle with its center provided exist in the plane - has been since generalized, or strengthened, to include alternative but equally restrictive conditions.

Other unique scenarios undoubtedly exist than those listed here. This is not an exhaustive list of possibilities.

==== Poncelet-Steiner without the circle center ====
In some configurations - or alternative paradigms - the circle center may be omitted entirely, and still all of Euclid remains constructible. In each of the following scenarios, the provided circle(s) are devoid of their centers. The approach to these situations is to construct the circle center from the provided information, leaving a circle with its center in the plane. Thus, these are problems reducible to one that&#x27;s already been solved by the Poncelet-Steiner theorem. For the most part they are, therefore, geometrically equivalent scenarios; any of these scenarios can produce a circle with its center, and a circle with center is sufficient to construct any of these scenarios by straightedge alone (excepting the arcs of other circles which naturally require a compass)

These scenarios do not contradict Steiner&#x27;s theorem which, although stating a center is absolutely required, also stipulates by hypothesis that only one circle exists in the plane with no other key information. Thus, a single circle devoid of its center, in the most general of cases, is indeed grossly insufficient to recover the properties, behaviors, and constructive power that the center point provides. Outlined below is a short list of some of the alternatives that can satisfactorily supplement the center.

&quot;One Circle Scenarios&quot;

In one of the simplest of alternative scenarios, a single circle is sufficient. It is necessary that two distinct sets of two parallel lines exist in the plane, such that these two sets of two lines are not all mutually parallel, or equivalently, any parallelogram in the plane. Alternatively, we may have only three parallel lines, one being a midline - that is, a middle line equidistant between the other two. Unfortunately for the single-circle cases, a single point or line is grossly insufficient on its own; a parallelogram or equivalent is necessary.

&quot;Two Circle Scenarios&quot;

In another set of alternatives where two circles are provided, it is sufficient that they are either concentric circles, or that they are intersecting. Intersecting circles come in two cases: two intersection points and one intersection point (tangential circles). When concentricity, two points of intersection, or one point of intersection and accompanied tangency, are known properties then sufficient information is provided.

Still other two-circle variations exist. It suffices to have two arbitrary circles in the plane, provided that at least one point is given on either the centerline through them or on their respective radical axis, or provided that no less than a single set of two parallel lines arbitrarily exist in the plane.

Yet other alternatives exist. One may also have, for example, an inscribed-circumscribed quadrilateral: a quadrilateral inscribed in one circle (vertices on the circumference, thus the circle circumscribes the quadrilateral) but the quadrilateral also circumscribes the other circle, thus its edges are tangential to the other circle. In other words, a cyclic quadrilateral to one circle, which is also a tangential quadrilateral to another circle. More generally, the tangential circle need not be interior the circumscribing circle nor interior to the quadrilateral; the edges may be extended infinitely into tangential lines.

&quot;Three Circle Scenarios&quot;

It also suffices, alternatively, to have given three non-intersecting circles, provided they do not all belong to the same coaxial (or coaxal) system of circles - that is, each pair of the three given circles must have a distinct radical axis between them. Three randomly placed circles in the plane almost certainly meet this condition; consequently, and unfortunately, the condition is often not stated with the claim, though it is vital for the purpose of recovering a center point. The condition is guaranteed whenever the three circles do not have collinear centers, or, if they do, are each exterior one another. There are other conditions which guarantee three circles are in different coaxial systems. Otherwise, and in general, it cannot be guaranteed.

&quot;Comment on four or more circles and common radical axes&quot;

There are no quantity of circles, which pairwise share the same radical axis, that can recover a circle center. When in the same coaxial system, any number of circles at all provides no more information than does two circles alone. That is to say, any multiplicity of circles greater than two in the same coaxial system is equivalent to just two in that coaxial system; circles may be reduced (i.e. collapsed, deleted) accordingly and without loss in generality. If in different coaxial systems, three circles are sufficient.

This can be shown from the opposite approach. From any two circles - which naturally define a coaxial system - any number of other circles in the same system may be arbitrarily (effectively) constructed by establishing five or more points on each, using Steiner constructions. Thus two circles implies infinitely many circles. It may be deduced that since two circles alone are insufficient to recover a circle center then so too are three or more circles in the same coaxial system.

Four or more circles (whether or not sharing a coaxial system) only provides convenience; the information they contain is otherwise redundant. Due to this fact, there is no reason to discuss four or more circles; they do not provide an alternative.

Unique alternatives are primarily found among the one and two circle arrangements. Indeed, for three circles within the same coaxial system, something more is necessary; as three circles in this system reduce to two, any supplementary conditions are equivalent to those in the two-circle scenarios. For example, three circles in the same coaxial system could still be satisfied with a single point on the centerline or radical axis.

==== Poncelet-Steiner without a complete circular arc ====
&quot;Severi&#x27;s arc of a circle&quot;

In another alternative, the entire circle is not required at all. In 1904, Francesco Severi proved that any small arc (of the circle), together with the centre, will suffice. This construction breaks the rusty compass at any point before the first circle is completed, but after it has begun, thus drawing some continuous portion of the arc of the circle in the plane, and still all constructions remain possible. Thus, the conditions hypothesizing the Poncelet-Steiner theorem may indeed be weakened, but only with respect to the completeness of the circular arc, and not, per the Steiner theorem, with respect to the center.

The theorem demonstrates the Steiner construction of the intersection points between a line and the circle of an arc, regardless of the size or position of the arc, using only a straightedge and the arc. The construction, also, does not make use of the center of the circle of the arc. Though the center is required to complete all of Euclid, as the Steiner theorem and the Poncelet-Steiner theorem both proves, the center is not needed in order to intersect a line with the circle of that arc. Using this construction, the arc, and the center of the circle of the arc, all of the above Poncelet-Steiner constructions are equally achievable, albeit with greater difficulty.

Severi&#x27;s proof illustrates that any arc of the circle fully characterizes the circumference and allows intersection points (of lines) with it to be found. With the inclusion of its center, the entire circle is described. Consequently, the Poncelet-Steiner Theorem&#x27;s minimum requirement of one circle is still satisfied. The circle remains, fully defined, and fully utilizable, regardless of the absence of some portion of the completed arc. Since Severi&#x27;s construction intersects lines with the circle of the arc, and the Poncelet-Steiner theorem constructs circle-circle intersections via the straightedge, there is no additional need to justify the circle-circle intersections under this restricted paradigm.

&quot;The arc as it relates to omissions of the circle center&quot;

Also in each of the previously mentioned scenarios wherein the circle centers are omitted, the completeness of the circular arc is not necessary, as per Severi&#x27;s theorem. However, in the case of two intersecting circles, their intersection points must be explicitly given whenever arcs of the circle(s) do not exist wherever intersection points do. That is, if the intersection points between two circles of arcs cannot be found directly by way of the two arcs, they must be provided. The completeness of the circular arc is otherwise redundant.

=== Control flow restrictions ===
Though a relatively new concept stemming from computational systems, the notion of control flow and its various restrictions in the context of geometry are also the subject of study. As it applies to the geometrical constructions, these restrictions are typically ones placed on the geometer. As with the case of constructible numbers, prohibitions against arbitrary point placement is one possible control flow restriction, previously discussed in this article. In the aforementioned Mohr-Mascheroni Theorem, restrictions on compass radius could be imposed, such as minimums and maximums given a set of starting points. Other examples may include restrictions on construction sequences and order, decision branching, and repetition or reiteration of steps. Another example of such a restriction is that demonstrated in Pythagorea - a gamified app and website geared toward teaching geometric concepts - in which only the straightedge is used, the geometer has only a set of uniformly-spaced lattice points upon which to begin constructions, and new points can only be constructed through intersections.

== Extended, liberated, or neusis constructions ==
Instead of restricting the rules of construction further, it is of equal interest to study relaxing the restrictions. These are sometimes called &quot;extended constructions&quot;, because they extend what is constructible by extending the allowable toolset. These constructions can also be called &quot;neusis constructions&quot; (from Greek) because they employ tools other than the compass and straightedge, or &quot;liberated constructions&quot; because they alleviate the restrictions of the traditional paradigm. These terms are not necessarily interchangeable or equivalent, as restricting or alleviating the rules of construction alone does not introduce new tools, and some alternative toolsets or additional tools do not necessarily extend the scope of constructibility.

Just as geometers have studied what remains possible to construct (and how) when additional restrictions are placed on traditional construction rules - such as compass only, straightedge only, rusty compass, etc. - they have also studied what constructions becomes possible that weren&#x27;t already when the natural restrictions inherent to traditional construction rules are alleviated. Questions such as &quot;what becomes constructible&quot;, &quot;how might it be constructed&quot;, &quot;what are the fewest traditional rules to be broken&quot;, &quot;what are the simplest tools needed&quot;, &quot;which seemingly different tools are equivalent&quot;, &quot;how does the new paradigm simplify traditional constructions&quot;, etc. are asked. 

The arbitrary angle is not trisectable using traditional compass and straightedge rules, for example, but the trisection becomes constructible when allowed the additional tool of an ellipse in the plane, which is itself not constructible. Some of the traditional unsolved problems such as angle trisection, doubling the cube, squaring the circle, finding cubic roots, etc., since proven to be impossible by straightedge and compass alone, have been resolved using an expanded set of tools. In general, the objects studied to extend the scope of what is constructible have included:
* Non-constructible &quot;auxiliary&quot; curves in the plane - including any of the conic sections, cycloids, lemniscates, limaçons, the Archimedean spiral, Euler spiral, any of the trisectrices or quadratrices, and others.
* Physical tools other than the compass and straightedge - generally called &quot;neuseis&quot; (plural) - which include specific tools such as the Tomahawk, markable and double-edged straightedges, graduated rulers, right triangular rulers, linkages, ellipsographs, French curves, and others.
* Paper-folding techniques, derived from the mathematical and geometric study of Origami.

Each of the three above categorical approaches have their own unique angle trisection solutions, as do many of the various tools and curves listed.

The ancient geometers considered the compass and straightedge constructions (known as &quot;planar constructions&quot;) as ideal and preferred. Second to that they preferred &quot;solid constructions&quot;, which included the use of conic sections in the plane other than the circle. They favored thirdly the use of arbitrary smooth curves in the plane (such as the Archimedean spiral), and least of all the use of neuseis (alternative physical handheld tools). It is doubtful that the ancient geometers - at least of the western world - even considered paper folding.

The term &quot;neusis&quot; (singular) or neusis construction may also refer to a specific tool or method employed by the ancient geometers.

=== Metrics, and a comment on the ruler ===
The graduated ruler is unique in that it defines a metric, and also a norm, and gives rise to the algebraic treatment of geometry, Cartesian graphing, and imports a standard unit for proportionality of segments. The algebraic approach to geometry offers a distinct proof of the Poncelet-Steiner theorem. Some algebraic operations performed in the geometric plane, even in traditional geometry, only have meaning in the context of an established field algebra, such as taking square roots.

=== Approximations ===
It is worthwhile to point out that in all construction paradigms, the implicit rule is that all constructions must terminate in a finite number of applications of the available tools (generally the compass and straightedge), and produce the exact intended results. It is taken for granted that, from mostly philosophical considerations such as platonic idealism and operationalism, the ancient Greek geometers emphasized finitude and exactness in their constructions. Entire discussions could be made with either of these conditions alleviated.

For any otherwise non-constructible figure:
* It is possible to approximate a construction to a predetermined level of accuracy using only compass and straightedge, using a reiterative approach.
* Exact construction may become possible at the infinite limit of this convergent process, but requires infinite constructions.

For example, an angle trisection may be performed exactly with compass and straightedge, using an infinite sequence of angle bisections. If the construction is terminated at some finite iteration, an accurate approximation of a trisection can be achieved to arbitrary accuracy. Although each point, line or circle is a valid construction, what it aims to approximate can never truly be achieved in finite applications of a compass and/or straightedge.

There are, alternatively, exactly constructible non-iteratively constructed figures that are reasonable approximations for non-constructible figures. For example, there is a relatively simple non-iterative constructions for an approximation of the heptagon. The construction is fairly accurate for most use, and does not constitute an arbitrary termination of an infinite process.

=== Neuseis as a center point alternative ===
Using Steiner constructions and a single circle in the plane without its center, the center point may be supplemented (and eventually constructed), and all of Euclid may be constructible, if the straightedge is substituted for any other device (neusis tool) which is capable of drawing arbitrary lines and their parallels (e.g. a markable straightedge, a graduated ruler, a double-edged straightedge).

A tool which may be used to draw lines and their perpendiculars through an arbitrary point, such as set squares or drafting triangles, is also sufficient.

=== The Cyclos ===
Some well-studied neuseis tools end up being no more and no less versatile than the compass and/or straightedge, neither extending nor contracting what is constructible. For example, the cyclos, a unique tool in its own right, is similar to the compass in that it draws circles; how it does this is however unique. Although simplifying some constructions, it does so often at the expense of complicating others.

The cyclos refers to a fictional tool postulated for the purposes of testing students&#x27; geometric understanding, and has its origins in the modern era for a modern problem. The cyclos is often mistakenly attributed to Euclid, as it was the original Olympiad problem-wording which proposed an alternative history whereby the cyclos was Euclid&#x27;s tool, though historically Euclid never had such a tool. The tool is only hypothetical - it does not exist - but is valuable as an exercise in abstract geometric thinking.

The neusis is capable of drawing the circle according to two properties:
* A circle may be drawn through two diametrically opposite points which define a circle by its diameter (in contrast to two points defining a circle by its radius, for which a standard compass is suitable).
* A circumscribing circle may be drawn through three non-collinear points.

The &quot;cyclos-only&quot; paradigm, which prohibits the use of a compass or straightedge, also allows arbitrary point placement on the circle (and in some interpretations the plane, or the line if provided). The intersections of two circles or arcs may be found directly, as is standard geometric practice. If provided, the intersection between two lines or a line and a circle may also be found directly, though the line is generally prohibited in the paradigm.

Ultimately the cyclos is proven to be geometrically equivalent to the compass, and therefore via the Mohr-Mascheroni theorem, all straightedge-compass constructions are possible with the cyclos.

== Further generalizations == 

The Poncelet-Steiner theorem has been generalized to higher dimensions, such as, for example, a three dimensional variation where the straightedge is replaced with a plane, and the circle with center is replaced with a sphere with center. This is essentially a &quot;straightedge only&quot; variation of three dimensional geometry. Though research is ongoing, and some propositions are yet to be proved, many of the properties that apply to the two dimensional case also apply to higher dimensions, as implementations of projective geometry. Additionally, some research is underway to generalize the Poncelet-Steiner theorem to non-Euclidean geometries.

<doc id="652663" wikidata="Q192402" url="?curid=652663" title="Rufus Wainwright">
<text>Rufus McGarrigle Wainwright (born July 22, 1973) is a Canadian and American singer, songwriter, and composer. He has recorded eleven studio albums and numerous tracks on compilations and film soundtracks. He has also written two classical operas and set Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets to music for a theatre piece by Robert Wilson.

Wainwright&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released through DreamWorks Records in May 1998. His second album, &quot;Poses&quot;, was released in June 2001. Wainwright&#x27;s third and fourth studio albums, &quot;Want One&quot; (2003) and &quot;Want Two&quot; (2004), were repackaged as the double album &quot;Want&quot; in 2005. In 2007, Wainwright released his fifth studio album, &quot;Release the Stars&quot;, and his first live album, &quot;Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall&quot;. 

His second live album, &quot;Milwaukee at Last!!!&quot;, was released in 2009, followed by the studio albums &quot;All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu&quot; (2010) and &quot;Out of the Game&quot; (2012). The double album &quot;Prima Donna&quot; (2015) was a recording of his opera of the same name. His ninth studio album, &quot;Take All My Loves: 9 Shakespeare Sonnets&quot; (2016), featured nine adaptions of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. Rufus&#x27; 10th studio album, &quot;Unfollow the Rules&quot;, was released on July 20, 2020. His 11th, &quot;Folkocracy&quot;, was released on June 2, 2023.

Wainwright is the son of musicians Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, and the older brother of singer Martha Wainwright.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Wainwright was born in Rhinebeck, New York, to folk singers Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III. His parents divorced when he was three, and he lived with his mother in Montreal, Canada, for most of his youth. His father is a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the 17th-century Dutch governor of New Amsterdam, later New York. Wainwright has dual US and Canadian citizenship. He attended high school at the Millbrook School in New York (which would later inspire his song &quot;Millbrook&quot;), and later briefly studied piano at McGill University in Montreal. 

He began playing the piano at age six, and started touring at age 13 with &quot;The McGarrigle Sisters and Family&quot;, a folk group featuring Rufus, his sister Martha, his mother Kate, and aunt Anna. His song &quot;I&#x27;m a-Runnin&#x27;&quot;, which he performed in the film &quot;Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller&quot; at the age of 14, earned him a nomination for a 1989 Genie Award for Best Original Song. He was nominated for a 1990 Juno Award for Most Promising Male Vocalist of the Year.

Wainwright identified as gay while a teenager. In 1999, he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that his father recognized his homosexuality early on. &quot;We&#x27;d drive around in the car, he&#x27;d play &#x27;Heart of Glass&#x27; and I&#x27;d sort of mouth the words, pretend to be Blondie. Just a sign of many other things to come as well.&quot; Wainwright later said in another interview that his parents &quot;could not even handle me being gay. We never talked about it really.&quot;

Wainwright became interested in opera during his adolescent years, and the genre strongly influences his music. For example, the song &quot;Barcelona&quot; features lyrics from the libretto of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Macbeth&quot;. During that time, he became interested in Édith Piaf, Al Jolson, and Judy Garland. As a youth he trained at Interlochen Arts Camp, studying classical music.

At age 14, Wainwright was sexually assaulted in London&#x27;s Hyde Park after picking up a man at a bar. In an interview years later, he described the event: &quot;I said I wanted to go to the park and see where this big concert was going on. I thought it was going to be a romantic walk in the park, but he raped me and robbed me afterwards and tried to strangle me&quot;. Wainwright states that he survived only by pretending to be an epileptic and faking a seizure. He has been reported to have stated that he remained celibate for five or seven years after the incident, but eventually became promiscuous.

===Rise to fame, debut album===
Throughout the summer of 1995, Wainwright played weekly shows at Cafe Sarajevo in Montreal. Eventually, he cut a series of demo tapes produced by Pierre Marchand, who later produced Wainwright&#x27;s second album &quot;Poses&quot;. The resulting tapes impressed Wainwright&#x27;s father Loudon, who passed them on to family friend and musician Van Dyke Parks. Parks then in turn sent the recordings to DreamWorks Records executive Lenny Waronker, who signed Wainwright to the label in 1996.

The singer moved to New York City in 1996, performing regularly at Club Fez. He relocated to Los Angeles that year and began his first studio album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot;. Waronker paired Wainwright with producer Jon Brion, and the two spent most of 1996 and 1997 making the record. Wainwright recorded 56 songs in total, on 62 rolls of tape. The sessions cost $700,000.

Wainwright&#x27;s self-titled debut received critical acclaim; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; recognized it as one of the best albums of the year, and named the singer Best New Artist of the year. Wainwright was nominated for four awards by the Gay &amp; Lesbian American Music Awards, including Album of the Year, Pop Recording of the Year and Video of the Year, and won for Best New Artist. &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Album and a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album. However, commercial success of the album was limited; the debut failed to chart in any country, though he ranked No.24 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart.

Wainwright toured with Sean Lennon in 1998 and began his first headline tour later that year. In December 1998, he appeared in a Gap commercial directed by Phil Harder, performing Frank Loesser&#x27;s &quot;What Are You Doing New Year&#x27;s Eve?&quot;. In March 1999, Wainwright began a headlining tour in Hoboken, New Jersey.

===&quot;Poses&quot; and struggle with addiction===
Wainwright lived in the Chelsea Hotel in New York City for six months, during which he wrote most of his second album. On June 5, 2001, Wainwright&#x27;s second album, &quot;Poses&quot;, was released to critical acclaim but limited sales. The album ranked No. 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 1 on the Top Heatseekers chart. &quot;Poses&quot; won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Album and a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album, and was nominated by the Juno Awards for Best Songwriter (&quot;Poses&quot; / &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; / &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;). From 2001 to 2004, he toured with Tori Amos, Sting, Ben Folds, and Guster, as well as headlining the 2001 and 2002 tour in support of the album.

Wainwright became addicted to crystal meth in the early 2000s and temporarily lost his vision. His addiction reached its peak in 2002, during what he described as &quot;the most surreal week of my life&quot;. During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, spent several nights partying with George W. Bush&#x27;s daughter Barbara, enjoyed a &quot;debauched evening&quot; with his mother and Marianne Faithfull, sang with Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons for Zaldy&#x27;s spring 2003 collection, and experienced recurring hallucinations of his father throughout. He decided after that he &quot;was either going to rehab or I was going to live with my father. I knew I needed an asshole to yell at me, and I felt he fitted the bill.&quot; He subsequently spent a month in a rehab facility in Minnesota.

===&quot;Want&quot; albums===
In 2003, Rufus released the full-length album &quot;Want One&quot;. Then Wainwright&#x27;s album &quot;Want Two&quot;, from which four songs were released as the EP &quot;Waiting for a Want&quot;, was released by DreamWorks/Geffen on November 16, 2004. The live iTunes Sessions EP entitled &quot;Alright, Already: Live in Montréal&quot; was released on March 15, 2005. A DVD entitled &quot;All I Want&quot;, featuring a biographical documentary, music videos, and live performances, was released internationally in 2005. That same year, Wainwright made two major contributions as a solo vocalist to a pair of records: the Mercury Prize-winning Antony and the Johnsons&#x27; &quot;I Am a Bird Now&quot; and Burt Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;At This Time&quot;.

&quot;Want One&quot; and &quot;Want Two&quot; were repackaged as &quot;Want&quot; for a November 2005 release to coincide with the beginning of a British tour. This version of &quot;Want One&quot; contains two extra songs: &quot;Es Muß Sein&quot; and &quot;Velvet Curtain Rag&quot;. The &quot;Want&quot; package in the UK has two bonus tracks: &quot;Chelsea Hotel No. 2&quot; (a Leonard Cohen cover) and &quot;In With the Ladies&quot;, which replace &quot;Coeur de parisienne – Reprise d&#x27;Arletty&quot; and &quot;Quand vous mourez de nos amours&quot; from 2004&#x27;s augmented edition.

===&quot;Release the Stars&quot; and &quot;Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall&quot;===
Wainwright&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Release the Stars&quot;, was released by Geffen on May 15, 2007. The album was produced by Wainwright and featured Richard Thompson, friend Teddy Thompson, sister Martha Wainwright, mother Kate McGarrigle, Neil Tennant, Joan Wasser, Julianna Raye, Larry Mullins (also known as Toby Dammit), and actress Siân Phillips. It reached No.2 on the UK Albums Chart, and debuted at No.23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single, &quot;Going to a Town&quot;, was released on April 3, 2007, in the iTunes Music Store. The second single released was &quot;Rules and Regulations&quot;, and the third single was a 500-copy (12&quot; vinyl) release of &quot;Tiergarten&quot;, a one-track EP with the Supermayer remix of &quot;Tiergarten&quot;, which was released exclusively through iTunes and 7digital on October 29.
Two music videos were released for the album: &quot;Going to a Town&quot;, directed by Sophie Muller, and &quot;Rules and Regulations&quot;, directed by Petro Papahadjopoulos and styled by J.W. Anderson. &quot;Release the Stars&quot; was certified gold in the UK. The accompanying world tour saw Wainwright visit North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, ending on February 14, 2008, with a concert at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

On June 10, 2006, NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot; broadcast an interview of Wainwright by Scott Simon. The segment concerned Wainwright&#x27;s sold-out pair of Carnegie Hall shows on June 14 and 15, 2006 in which he performed the entire Judy Garland concert album that was recorded there in 1961. He later repeated his performance at the London Palladium, the Paris Olympia, and the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Live CD and DVD recordings of the concerts were released on December 4, 2007. The DVD is entitled &quot;Rufus! Rufus! Rufus! Does Judy! Judy! Judy!: Live from the London Palladium&quot;. The CD album, &quot;Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall&quot;, is a recording of his show at the New York venue. In 2008, Garland&#x27;s daughter Lorna Luft expressed strong approval of Wainwright&#x27;s recordings of her mother&#x27;s songs. The album was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.

===Blackoutsabbath and &quot;Prima Donna&quot;===
Wainwright created the concept of Blackoutsabbath in early 2008. In an attempt to become more environmentally conscious, participants are asked to live &quot;off the grid&quot; as much as possible on a designated date by unplugging appliances, walking or cycling for transportation, turning out lights and decreasing energy usage in any other ways possible.

As the sun sets on the evening of Blackoutsabbath, participants write ways they can contribute to the Earth&#x27;s well-being throughout the rest of the year. Annual benefit concerts take place to raise awareness of the cause. Special guests performing at the concert included Joan Wasser, Jenni Muldaur, and friend and fellow singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson. The organization&#x27;s official site contains updates about the program and contains links to various tools, green products and services, studies, and groups that promote energy conservation and environmental protection.

In December 2008 Rufus performed alongside his sister, Martha Wainwright, and mother, Kate McGarrigle, as well as many more of his family at the Knitting Factory in downtown Manhattan. Joined by other artists such as Emmylou Harris, Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson, the cast performed original and traditional Christmas-themed songs. In November 2009 Revelation Films released the concert on DVD.

Following his 2007–2008 tour, Wainwright began writing his first opera, &quot;Prima Donna&quot;, about &quot;a day in the life of an opera singer&quot;, anxiously preparing for her comeback, who falls in love with a journalist. There are four characters, and the libretto is in French. The opera was originally commissioned by Metropolitan Opera general manager Peter Gelb. However, because of a dispute over Wainwright&#x27;s decision to write the libretto in French and the Met&#x27;s inability to schedule an opening in the 2009 season, Wainwright and the Met ended their relationship. Instead of a New York opening, &quot;Prima Donna&quot; was staged during the Manchester International Festival, where the first performance took place at the Palace Theatre on July 10, 2009. Reviews for the performance were mixed, with one publication suggesting Wainwright &quot;may struggle to convince critics he is worthy of a place among the greats&quot;. &quot;Prima Donna&quot; won a Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding New Musical/Opera in June 2011.

===&quot;All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu&quot; and birth of daughter===

In November 2009, Wainwright announced that he had finished recording his sixth studio album, and was calling it &quot;All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu&quot;. The album was released on March 23 in Canada, April 5 in the UK and April 20 in the US, with the first single &quot;Who Are You New York?&quot;.

In December 2009, Wainwright appeared with sister Martha Wainwright and mother Kate McGarrigle at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising $55,000 for the Kate McGarrigle Fund, which was established in 2008 to raise awareness of sarcoma, a rare cancer that affects connective tissue such as bone, muscle, nerves, and cartilage. It was the last performance made by his mother before her death in January 2010.

In late 2010 Wainwright became engaged to his partner Jörn Weisbrodt. The couple moved to Toronto, Ontario, in early 2012 after Weisbrodt was named artistic director of Toronto&#x27;s annual Luminato festival.

In 2011, Wainwright announced the birth of his first child, with childhood friend Lorca Cohen, daughter of Leonard Cohen.

In July 2011 a 19-disc box set called &quot;House of Rufus&quot; containing all his studio and live recordings as well as previously unreleased material was released.

===&quot;Out of the Game&quot; and marriage===
Wainwright recorded his seventh studio album with producer Mark Ronson. He described the new songs as more &quot;danceable&quot; than his previous material. The album, titled &quot;Out of the Game,&quot; was released in late April 2012 in the UK and Canada and in early May in the US.

On August 23, 2012, Wainwright and Jörn Weisbrodt married in Montauk, New York. Artist Justin Vivian Bond officiated.

===Second opera===
His second opera, called &quot;Hadrian&quot;, premiered at the Canadian Opera Company as their opening production of the 2018 mainstage season at the Four Seasons Centre in Toronto, directed by Canadian Director Peter Hinton, with libretto written by Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor. &quot;Hadrian&quot; attended the workshop Opera Fusion: New Works, a collaboration of Cincinnati Opera and University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, before its premiere.

=== &quot;Prima Donna&quot;&#x27;s revival ===

In 2015, Wainwright launched a new version of his first opera, accompanied by a film directed by Francesco Vezzoli, featuring Cindy Sherman as the Prima Donna. The finale was shot in Paris during spring 2015 and produced by Petite Maison Production, before it premiered in Athens in September.

===&quot;Unfollow the Rules&quot;===
Almost a year after releasing the stand-alone single &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; in October 2018, Rufus signed a record deal with music publisher and record label BMG Rights Management for a new album. Soon after, the new song &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; was released as the first single from the album. In February 2020, the album, &quot;Unfollow the Rules&quot;, was announced alongside the release of the Joni Mitchell-inspired single &quot;Damsel in Distress&quot; and was slated for an April release. A third single, &quot;Peaceful Afternoon&quot;, was released on digital platforms in March, with a French version, &quot;Pièce à vivre&quot;, as a B-side. In early April, the album release was delayed until July after escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wainwright stating that &quot;The CD&#x27;s and vinyl LP&#x27;s of my new album Unfollow The Rules are stuck in the warehouses they had to shut down to make way for all essential businesses being able to operate at full speed&quot;, adding &quot;You know that I am an old school guy and for me the physical product is extremely important. I am incredibly proud of this album and the way I want you to experience it ideally is listening to it from front to back in the comfort of your living room, reading the lyrics, and looking at the booklet that I carefully designed.&quot; This announcement was accompanied by the announcement of a fourth single, &quot;Alone Time&quot;, which was released on April 24, 2020, the date the LP was originally due to be released. One more single, a tongue-in-cheek commentary on fame and status relative to geographic location entitled &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Big&quot;, was released in early June. On July 10, Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s 10th studio album, &quot;Unfollow the Rules&quot;, was released. The album was met with a warm reception upon release and has amassed mostly positive critic reviews, with an aggregate score of 82 on Metacritic, which is his highest score on the site equal only to his 2001 LP &quot;Poses&quot;.

===&quot;Folkocracy&quot;, BBC Proms and &quot;Dream Requiem&quot;===
On March 7, 2023, Wainwright announced his eleventh studio album, &quot;Folkocracy&quot;, would be released in June 2023. He said, &quot;This album is almost like a recorded birthday party and birthday present to myself. I just invited all the singers that I greatly admire and always wanted to sing with.&quot; On the same day, Wainwright released &quot;Down in the Willow Garden&quot;, which features Brandi Carlile. On March 24, 2023, Wainwright released the single &quot;Dear World&quot;, a piano ballad about healing the world.

On September 5, 2023, Wainwright appeared at the Royal Albert Hall in the BBC Proms, performing songs from his albums &quot;Want One&quot; and &quot;Want Two&quot; specially arranged for the BBC Concert Orchestra, with conductor Sarah Hicks.

Wainwright&#x27;s opera, &quot;Dream Requiem&quot;, premiered in 2024. A soundtrack album is due for release in February 2025; actress Meryl Streep is featured.

==Artistry==
In addition to his tenor singing voice, Wainwright plays piano and guitar, often switching between the two instruments when performing live. While some songs feature just Wainwright and his piano, his later work is often accompanied by rock instrumentation or a symphony orchestra, displaying complex layering and harmonies with an operatic feel. Wainwright is an opera enthusiast and likes Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;lieder&quot;. Wainwright&#x27;s music has been described as &quot;popera&quot; (pop opera) or &quot;baroque pop&quot;. Many of his compositions are densely packed amalgams of strings, horns, operatic choruses, and ragtime rhythms, with a warm vocal timbre.

He often performs with his sister, Martha Wainwright, on backup vocals. Despite critical acclaim, Wainwright has experienced limited commercial success in the United States, although the release of &quot;Release the Stars&quot; saw increased media attention there, as did the associated 2007 U.S. tour.

===Themes===
Wainwright&#x27;s work contains several recurring themes: opera, literature, pop culture, politics, and love (often unrequited love). &quot;Foolish Love&quot; and &quot;Danny Boy&quot; are about a crush he once had on a straight man. Other songs address full-blown love and the consequences of falling out of love (&quot;This Love Affair&quot;, &quot;Leaving for Paris&quot;, and &quot;Peach Trees&quot;). Wainwright also sings about his family relationships. &quot;Beauty Mark&quot;, &quot;Little Sister&quot; and &quot;Martha&quot;, and &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; address, respectively, his experiences with his mother, sisters, and father. Several songs deal with his experiences with addiction (&quot;Go Or Go Ahead&quot;, &quot;Early Morning Madness&quot; &quot;Baby&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What It Is&quot;).

The song &quot;Matinee Idol&quot; was written about River Phoenix. &quot;Memphis Skyline&quot; is a tribute to the late singer Jeff Buckley, whom he met briefly in the 1990s when Wainwright was an up-and-coming act. By this time, Buckley had already released his first album &quot;Grace&quot;, and was well on his way to stardom. The two met several months prior to Buckley&#x27;s drowning, during a gig by Wainwright. The song references &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, a Leonard Cohen song covered by Buckley (and later by Wainwright). &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Off the Hook&quot; is written to close friend and fellow musician Teddy Thompson.

===Legacy===
Wainwright and his music have influenced several artists in the music industry. They include Katy Perry, Olly Alexander of Years &amp; Years, Liv Bruce of Pwr Bttm, and Kimbra.

In Nick Hornby&#x27;s book &quot;Slam&quot;, the child born to the young protagonists gets named &quot;Rufus&quot; (or Roof for short) because his mother listened to Rufus Wainwright while recovering from the ordeal of giving birth.

==Personal life==
Wainwright, a gay man, married German art administrator Jörn Weisbrodt on August 23, 2012. Wainwright has a daughter, Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen, born February 2, 2011, conceived via sperm donation by Wainwright to photographer and antique dealer Lorca Cohen, daughter of Leonard Cohen. She lives with her mother.

===Political views===
Wainwright identifies as &quot;a complete libertarian&quot; and stated in 2008, &quot;I don&#x27;t think any government should encroach on what goes on in the bedroom at all.&quot; In April 2010, Wainwright came out publicly in favour of legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States because he wanted to marry Weisbrodt. Wainwright stated, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t a huge gay marriage supporter before I met Jörn because I love the whole old-school promiscuous Oscar Wilde freak show of what &#x27;being gay&#x27; once was. But since meeting Jörn that all changed.&quot; In 2014, Wainwright reiterated he was a &quot;complete libertarian&quot;, and explained that while he did not initially support President Barack Obama, he said he has &quot;become a very big Obama fan&quot;, expressing support for his agenda, including women&#x27;s healthcare and government-provided health coverage.

Wainwright has publicly opposed 45th US President Donald Trump, addressing him in the music video for his song &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; in 2018 and stating &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to minimise the ineptitude and pure evil of the Trump administration&quot; in a 2020 interview with &quot;NME&quot;. In October 2024, he issued a statement in response to the use of his cover of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania on October 14. He described its use at the rally as &quot;the height of blasphemy&quot; but hoped, without much expectation, that listening to the lyrics of the song might engender a sense of remorse in Trump. He also endorsed Kamala Harris&#x27; presidential campaign.

==Work in film, television, and theatre==

Wainwright has appeared in the films &quot;The Aviator&quot;, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Silver Bullets&quot; and its extended footage follow-up, &quot;Stray Bullets&quot;, and &quot;Heights&quot; in addition to his role in &quot;Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller&quot; but said in a 2010 interview &quot;I definitely enjoy seeing myself thirty feet high, but it&#x27;s not something that I&#x27;m running toward passionately&quot;. He has also recorded tracks specially for films, including &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, &quot;I Am Sam&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;, &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, &quot;Zoolander&quot;, and &quot;Leonard Cohen: I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. His recording of &quot;Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered&quot; plays during the closing credits of the film &quot;The History Boys&quot;. He is seen in the Denys Arcand film &quot;Days of Darkness (L&#x27;Âge des ténèbres)&quot;, performing two arias.

The &quot;All I Want&quot; DVD, released in 2005, features a full-length documentary (&quot;A Portrait of Rufus Wainwright&quot;), performances at Central Park Summerstage and Cambridge Corn Exchange, studio sessions, music videos, and two bonus Easter eggs: a 12-minute documentary from 1998, featuring Wainwright and his family, and a short tribute to the McGarrigle sisters featuring Rufus and Martha.

In February 2005, the Pennsylvania Ballet premiered a ballet by Matthew Neenan that was set to Wainwright&#x27;s music. The Pennsylvania Ballet has performed the work (titled &quot;11:11&quot;) several times, including during an eponymous program in June 2006. It has been an audience favorite, although critical reviews have been mixed.

Stephen Petronio commissioned Wainwright to write a score for his dance production &quot;BLOOM&quot;, which was performed at Joyce Theater in New York in April 2006. For the lyrics, the two selected poems by Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, and Petronio arranged for the Young People&#x27;s Choir of New York to sing them.

In May 2006, Wainwright was one of three guests (along with Robbie Williams and Frances Barber) to star with the Pet Shop Boys in a concert at London&#x27;s Mermaid Theatre. He covered the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; &quot;Casanova in Hell&quot; (from &quot;Fundamental&quot;). The critically acclaimed show was broadcast on the UK&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 and repeated on BBC 6 Music, and released as a CD (&quot;Concrete&quot;) in October 2006.

In June 2007, Wainwright was a part of the multi-artist True Colors Tour, which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada. The tour, sponsored by the Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007. Hosted by comedian Margaret Cho and headlined by Cyndi Lauper, the tour included Debbie Harry, the Gossip, the Indigo Girls, the Dresden Dolls, the MisShapes, and Erasure. Profits went to the Human Rights Campaign. In August 2007, Wainwright said that he considered it a &quot;great honor&quot; to perform on the gay rights tour.

Wainwright continued to tour during 2007 and embraced forms of expression not usually part of mainstream American music concerts. These included dressing in red lipstick and stiletto heeled shoes to perform Judy Garland songs, and expressing his concerns against the current U.S. political situation. His performances were critically acclaimed.

In April 2009, Wainwright worked with the Berliner Ensemble and the avant-garde director Robert Wilson, who hired Wainwright to supply the music for a joint staging of &quot;Shakespeares Sonette&quot; based on Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets.

In June 2012, Wainwright released a comedy video on the Funny or Die website, giving his interpretation of a number of jingles from chewing gum commercials. Also in 2012, Wainwright wrote and sang &quot;Metaphorical Blanket&quot; in the film &quot;Any Day Now&quot;.

In December 2023, Wainwright performed &quot;Hushabye Mountain&quot; from the 1968 movie &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; on the primetime CBS special &quot;Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic&quot;.

In March 2024, a new adaptation of John Cassavetes&#x27;s &quot;Opening Night&quot;, for which Wainwright wrote the music and lyrics (with book by Ivo van Hove) opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London.

<text>The Social Democracy of Poland (, SDPL) is a social-democratic political party in Poland.

==Foundation==
The party was founded in April 2004 as a splinter group from the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). The SDPL should not be confused with a former party the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SdRP) which existed between 1990–99 and was a direct predecessor of the SLD.

==First elections==
SDPL contested its first elections in June 2004, this being for Polish representation to the European parliament. The party gained 5.3%, which saw three members elected to parliament. In May 2005 the party reached an agreement with Labour Union (UP) and Greens 2004 to jointly contest for the forthcoming Polish parliamentary elections, under the SDPL banner. SDPL managed to gain 3.9% of the vote, but fell short of the 5% threshold required to win parliamentary representation. SDPL put forward its party leader Marek Borowski, as candidate for the Polish presidential elections held in the following month of October. Borowski came fourth in the first round, winning 10.3% of the vote.

==Coalition within LiD==
On 3 September 2006, SDPL joined the newly formed Left and Democrats (LiD) coalition, made up of the centre-left parties SDPL, SLD, UP and the centrist Democratic Party – demokraci.pl. This alliance was created with a view to jointly contest the upcoming local government elections. The LiD alliance was maintained for the Polish parliamentary elections of October 2007, and LiD achieved 13.2% of the vote. This translated into 53 lower house seats, 10 of which were won by SDPL.

After LiD dissolved, 8 out of 10 SDPL MPs formed a new parliamentary caucus called &quot;Social Democracy of Poland – New Left&quot; (&quot;Socjaldemoracja Polska – Nowa Lewica&quot;, SDPL-NL).

On 3 February 2013, SDPL leader Wojciech Filemonowicz and Palikot&#x27;s Movement leader Janusz Palikot stated an ambition to form an electoral alliance between the two parties to contest the European elections in 2014. The alliance was named Europa Plus. The SDPL withdrew from the alliance, along with the Union of the Left, on 7 February 2014.

===Members of the Sejm===
Prior to the October, 2011, Polish parliamentary election, where the party&#x27;s representation was wiped out, SDPL had three members of the Sejm:

* Marek Borowski (19 – Warsaw I)
* Grażyna Ciemniak (4 – Bydgoszcz)
* Izabella Sierakowska (6 – Lublin)

Marek Borowski, was elected to the Polish Senate in the 2011 elections as an independent candidate. He retained his membership of SDPL.

<doc id="652673" wikidata="Q315255" url="?curid=652673" title="Pierre-Charles Villeneuve">
<text>Pierre-Charles-Jean-Baptiste-Silvestre de Villeneuve (; 31 December 1763 – 22 April 1806) was a French Navy officer who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He was in command of a French and Spanish fleet which was defeated by the British Royal Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

== Early career ==
Villeneuve was born in 1763 at Valensole, and joined the French Navy in 1779. He took part in naval operations in the American Revolutionary War, serving as an ensign on &quot;Marseillais&quot;, in de Grasse&#x27;s fleet.

Despite his aristocratic ancestry, he sympathised with the French Revolution, dropping the nobiliary particle from his name, and was able to continue his service in the Navy when other aristocratic officers were purged. He served during several battles, and consequently was promoted to rear admiral in 1796.

At the Battle of the Nile in 1798 he was in command of the rear division. His ship, , was one of only two French ships of the line to escape the defeat. He was captured soon afterwards when the British took the island of Malta, but he was soon released. He was criticised for not engaging the British at the Nile, but Napoleon considered him a &quot;lucky man&quot; and his career was not affected. His treatment by the British was not bad, but led to him describing them as &#x27;gobelins gras&#x27; (lit. &#x27;&quot;greasy goblins&quot;&#x27;) in a letter to his family.

In 1804, Napoleon ordered Villeneuve, now a vice admiral stationed at Toulon, to escape from the British blockade, overcome the British fleet in the English Channel, and allow the planned invasion of Britain to take place. To draw off the British defences, Villeneuve was to sail to the West Indies, where it was planned that he would combine with the Spanish fleet and the French fleet from Brest and attack British possessions in the Caribbean, before returning across the Atlantic to destroy the British Channel squadrons and escort the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; from their camp at Boulogne to victory in England.

== Battle of Trafalgar ==

=== Prelude to the battle ===

After an abortive expedition in January, Villeneuve finally left Toulon on 29 March 1805 with eleven ships of the line. He evaded Nelson&#x27;s blockade, passed the Strait of Gibraltar on 8 April and crossed the Atlantic with Nelson&#x27;s fleet in pursuit, but about a month behind owing to unfavourable winds. In the West Indies Villeneuve waited for a month at Martinique, but Admiral Ganteaume&#x27;s Brest fleet did not appear. Eventually Villeneuve was pressured by French army officers into beginning the planned attack on the British, but he succeeded only in recapturing the island fort of Diamond Rock off Martinique. On 7 June he learned that Nelson had reached Antigua. On 8 June he and his fleet were able to intercept a homeward-bound convoy of 15 British merchant vessels escorted by the frigate and the sloop or schooner . The two British warships managed to escape, but Villeneuve&#x27;s fleet captured the entire convoy, valued at some five million pounds. Villeneuve then sent the prizes into Guadeloupe under the escort of the frigate . On 11 June Villeneuve set out for Europe with Nelson again in pursuit.

On 22 July Villeneuve, now with twenty ships of the line and seven frigates, passed Cape Finisterre on the northwest coast of Spain and entered the Bay of Biscay. Here he met a British fleet of fifteen ships of the line commanded by Vice Admiral Sir Robert Calder. In the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre, a confused action in bad visibility, the British, though outnumbered, were able to cut off and capture two Spanish ships.

For two days Villeneuve shadowed the retreating British, but did not seek a battle. Instead he sailed to A Coruña, arriving on 1 August. Here he received orders from Napoleon to sail to Brest and Boulogne as planned. Instead, perhaps believing a false report of a superior British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, and against the Spanish commanders&#x27; objections, he sailed away back to Cádiz, rendering Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of Britain wholly impossible.

=== The battle ===

At Cádiz the combined French and Spanish fleets were kept under blockade by Nelson. In September, Villeneuve was ordered to sail for Naples and attack British shipping in the Mediterranean, but he was initially unwilling to move and continued in blatant disregard of superior orders.

In mid-October he learned that Napoleon was about to replace him as commanding officer with François Étienne de Rosily-Mesros and order him to Paris to account for his actions. (Napoleon had written to the Minister of Marine, &quot;Villeneuve does not possess the strength of character to command a frigate. He lacks determination and has no moral courage.&quot;) Before his replacement could arrive, Villeneuve gave the order to sail on 18 October.

Inexperienced crews and the difficulties of getting out of Cádiz meant that it took two days to get all 34 ships out of port and into some kind of order. On 21 October 1805 Villeneuve learned of the size of the British fleet, and turned back to Cádiz, but the combined fleets were intercepted by Nelson off Cape Trafalgar. Nelson, though outnumbered, won the Battle of Trafalgar, and Villeneuve&#x27;s flagship was captured along with many other French and Spanish ships.

== Aftermath and death ==

The British sent Villeneuve to England in the &quot;Euryalus&quot; but released him on parole; during this time he lived in Bishop&#x27;s Waltham in Hampshire. He stayed at the Crown Inn public house and his men, who numbered 200, stayed in local houses. He was allowed to attend the funeral of Lord Nelson whilst at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham. Freed in late 1805, he returned to France, where he attempted to go back into military service, but his requests were not answered.

On 22 April 1806, he was found dead at the &quot;Hôtel de la Patrie&quot; in Rennes with five stab wounds in the left lung and one in the heart. He had left a farewell letter to his wife. A verdict of suicide was recorded. The nature of his death ensured that this verdict was much mocked in the British press of the time and suspicions abounded that Napoleon had secretly ordered Villeneuve&#x27;s murder. The question of whether Villeneuve committed suicide has been a source of contention among historians ever since.

== Legacy ==
His name is etched on the Arc de Triomphe.

<doc id="652676" wikidata="Q2699525" url="?curid=652676" title="XO (Elliott Smith album)">
<text>XO is the fourth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, released on August 25, 1998, by DreamWorks Records.

== Recording ==

Early sessions for the album began at Larry Crane&#x27;s Jackpot Recording Studio after the release of &quot;Either/Or&quot; in 1997. These sessions would yield early demos of several album tracks, as well as outtakes later released posthumously on &quot;New Moon&quot;. Work began in earnest on the album in early 1998, after Smith traveled to Los Angeles to work with producers Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. An early working title for the album was &quot;Grand Mal&quot;.

The title of the first track, &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;, was inspired by Smith&#x27;s recollections of his grandmother singing in her glee club, Sweet Adelines International. &quot;Amity&quot; is believed to be named after a friend who can be seen in photographs from Smith&#x27;s 1997 tour. &quot;Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands&quot; is based on a true story of an intervention that saw Smith check into a rehab facility in Arizona. Smith&#x27;s original lyrics bear this out further, with references to &#x27;the desert&#x27;, a &#x27;dream-killing doctor&#x27;, and a &#x27;twelve-stepping cop&#x27;.

== Release ==

&quot;XO&quot; was released by DreamWorks Records on August 25, 1998. It was Smith&#x27;s first solo record on a major record label, though he had previously released music on a major label with his band Heatmiser&#x27;s final album, &quot;Mic City Sons&quot; (1996).

Singles released from the album were &quot;Waltz #2 (XO)&quot; in the same year and &quot;Baby Britain&quot; the following year.

== Reception ==

&quot;XO&quot; was well received by critics upon its release. Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote, &quot;Smith&#x27;s songwriting continues to improve, as each of [the album&#x27;s] fourteen tracks displays his inarguable mastery of the pop song structure more clearly than ever.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, indicating &quot;a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like&quot;. His review described the album&#x27;s music as &quot;high tune, low affect,&quot; citing &quot;Waltz #2 (XO)&quot; and &quot;Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands&quot; as highlights. &quot;XO&quot; placed at number five on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s 1998 end-of-year Pazz &amp; Jop poll.

In its retrospective review, BBC Music wrote, &quot;the budget might have gone up, but Smith&#x27;s masterful way with an understated melody and melancholic lyric remained firmly intact&quot;, calling &quot;XO&quot; &quot;perhaps the greatest long-player Smith released; if not, it&#x27;s certainly the equal of the preceding &quot;Either/Or&quot;. Repeat listens don&#x27;t dull it in the slightest, every barbed one-liner and exhalation of despair perfectly preserved&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the record &quot;a tastefully commercialized production (completely with horns and strings) that respects Smith&#x27;s privacy and, in fact, does him a solid service. [...] If the songs are not the most profound or developed of Smith&#x27;s catalogue, it&#x27;s still a great record that proves how durable integrity can be.&quot;

A 2023 review by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Jayson Greene described the album as &quot;a transformational landmark and a logical next step for the restless composer&quot; and remarked that the &quot;breadth and depth of &quot;XO&quot; astonished even his benefactors&quot;.

== Legacy ==

In 2010, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine placed &quot;XO&quot; at number 90 on its list of the 125 best albums in the magazine&#x27;s lifetime. Pitchfork Media placed the album at number 68 in their list of the greatest albums of the 1990s.

Matthew LeMay has written a book about &quot;XO&quot; as part of the 33⅓ series of books on albums, released on April 6, 2009, by the Continuum International Publishing Group.

RJD2 sampled &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Understand&quot; on the song &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; on his album &quot;Deadringer&quot;. Indie rock band Grandaddy performed &quot;Oh Well, Okay&quot; live in 2012 as a tribute to Smith.

<text>Nathalie Sarraute (; born Natalia Ilinichna Tcherniak (); – 19 October 1999) was a French writer and lawyer. She was nominated in 1969 for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Nobel Committee member Lars Gyllensten.

==Personal life==
Sarraute was born in Ivanovo-Voznesensk (now Ivanovo), 300 km north-east of Moscow. She was the daughter of Pauline (née Chatounovsky), a writer, and Ilya Tcherniak, a chemist. She was of Jewish origin. Following the divorce of her parents, she spent her childhood shuttled between France and Russia. In 1909 she moved to Paris with her father. Sarraute studied law and literature at the prestigious Sorbonne, having a particular fondness for contemporary literature and the works of Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf, who greatly affected her conception of the novel, then later studied history at the University of Oxford and sociology in Berlin, before passing the French bar exam (1926–1941) and becoming a lawyer.

In 1925, she married Raymond Sarraute, a fellow lawyer, with whom she had three daughters. In 1932 she wrote her first book, &quot;Tropismes,&quot; a series of brief sketches and memories that set the tone for her entire &quot;oeuvre&quot;. The novel was first published in 1939, although the impact of World War II stunted its popularity. In 1941, Sarraute was barred from working as a lawyer as a result of the Vichy regime&#x27;s antisemitic laws. During this time, she went into hiding and made arrangements to divorce her husband in an effort to protect him (although they eventually stayed together).

Sarraute died at the age of 99 in 1999 in Paris, France. Her daughter, the journalist Claude Sarraute, was married to French Academician Jean-François Revel.

==Career==

Sarraute dedicated herself to literature, with her most prominent work being &quot;Portrait of a Man Unknown&quot; (1948), a work applauded by Jean-Paul Sartre, who famously referred to it as an &quot;anti-novel&quot; and who also contributed a foreword. Despite such high critical praise, however, the work only drew notice from literary insiders, as did her follow-up, &quot;Martereau&quot;.

Sarraute&#x27;s essay &quot;The Age of Suspicion&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Ère du soupçon&quot;, 1956) served as a prime manifesto for the nouveau roman literary movement, alongside Alain Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s &quot;For a New Novel&quot;. Sarraute became, along with Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon, Marguerite Duras, and Michel Butor, one of the figures most associated with the rise of this new trend in writing, which sought to radically transform traditional narrative models of character and plot. Sarraute was awarded the &quot;Prix international de littérature&quot; for her novel &quot;The Golden Fruits&quot; in 1963, which led to greater popularity and exposure for the author. That same year, Sarraute also began working as a dramatist, authoring a total of six plays, including &quot;Le Silence&quot; (1963), &quot;Le Mensonge&quot; (1965) and &quot;Elle est là&quot; (1993). As a result of Sarraute&#x27;s growing popularity and public profile, she was invited to speak at a number of literary events in her native country of Russia ,in France, and abroad.

Sarraute&#x27;s work, including the novels &quot;Between Life and Death&quot; (1968), &quot;The Use of Speech&quot; (1980) and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Yourself&quot; (1989), have been translated into more than 30 languages. Her work has often been referred to as &quot;difficult,&quot; as a result of her experimental style and abandonment of traditional literary conventions. Sarraute celebrated the death of the literary &quot;character&quot; and placed her primary emphasis on the creation of a faithful depiction of psychological phenomena, as in her novella &quot;The Golden Fruits&quot;, consisting entirely of interior monologues, and the novel &quot;The Planetarium&quot; (1959), which focuses on a young man&#x27;s obsession with moving into his aunt&#x27;s apartment. The constantly shifting perspectives and points of view in Sarraute&#x27;s work serve to undermine the author&#x27;s hand, while at the same time embracing the incoherence of lived experience.

In contrast to the relative difficulty of Sarraute&#x27;s novels, her memoir &quot;Childhood&quot; is considered an easier read. Penned when she was over eighty years old, Sarraute&#x27;s autobiography is hardly a straightforward memoir, as she challenges her own capacity to accurately recall her past throughout the work. In the 1980s, the autobiography was adapted into a one-act Broadway play starring Glenn Close. The issues with memory which Sarraute highlighted in her autobiography carried through to her last novel, &quot;Here&quot;, published in 1995, in which the author explores a range of existential issues relating to the formlessness of both individual and social reality.

Agnès Varda dedicated her 1985 film &quot;Sans toit ni loi&quot; (Vagabonde) to her.

<text>Basil Isaac Hirschowitz (29 May 1925 – 19 January 2013) was an academic gastroenterologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) best known in the field for having invented an improved optical fiber which allowed the creation of a useful flexible endoscope. This invention revolutionized the practice of gastroenterology and also was a key invention in optical fiber communication in multiple industries.

Hirschowitz was born in Bethal, South Africa. He received his medical education at University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. It was from this institution that he earned M.B. and B.Ch. degrees in 1947. He received Postdoctoral training from University of the Witwatersrand, earning an M.D. degree.

In 1953 he moved to the United States, where he continued his gastrointestinal fellowship at the University of Michigan and joined the faculty between 1954 and 1957.
Hirschowitz became a naturalized citizen of the US in 1961.
Among his many awards, Basil Hirschowitz received the Schindler Medal of the ASGE, the Friedenwald Medal of the AGA (1992), the General Motors Cancer Research Awards Kettering Prize (1987), the UAB Distinguished Faculty Lecturer, and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Science of Medicine. The Alabama Healthcare Hall of Fame honors Dr. Basil Hirschowitz for reaching the pinnacle of academic medicine as a teacher, scientist, and clinician. In 2006 he became M.D.h.c (Honorary Doctor of Medicine) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

Groll-Hirschowitz syndrome — a rare genetic condition characterized by gastrointestinal abnormalities, deafness and neuropathy. It is named in honour of B. Hirschowitz and A. Groll, who first described the condition.

Hirschowitz died in Birmingham, Alabama on 19 January 2013.

<doc id="652699" wikidata="Q4202277" url="?curid=652699" title="Enforcement">
<text>Enforcement is the proper execution of the process of ensuring compliance with laws, regulations, rules, standards, and social norms. 

Governments attempt to effectuate successful implementation of policies by enforcing laws and regulations.
Enactment refers to application of a law or regulation, or carrying out of an executive or judicial order.

==Theories of enforcement==
Enforcement serves a number of functions; the enforcement of social norms can ensure conformity within insular communities, the enforcements of laws can maximize social benefits and protect the public interest, and enforcement may also serve the self-interest of the institutions that oversee enforcement. Enforcement can be effectuated by both public institutions and private, non-governmental actors. Enforcement is often accomplished through coercive means or by utilizing power disparities to constrain action. Some scholars, such as Kate Andrias, have also argued that institutions enforce rules when deciding &quot;when and how to apply&quot; laws and regulations. 

===Delegation of enforcement powers===
Some governments will delegate enforcement powers to subordinate governmental entities or private parties. In the United States, for example, the federal government and state governments often delegate a range of enforcement powers to administrative agencies. There has been considerable debate in legal scholarship about the degree to which governments should oversee and supervise institutions to which enforcement powers have been delegated.

==Enforcement mechanisms==
In 2017, of 265 policies for ocean protection only 13% had specific enforcement mechanisms.

Enforcement mechanisms are major component of governance structures. It has been suggested that an effective global public health security convention would require a governing body (or bodies) to enforce the framework with appropriate enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/S2468-2667(21)00070-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches include the concept of &quot;climate clubs&quot; of polities for climate change mitigation. In such, &quot;border adjustments [...] have to be introduced to target those states that do not participate [...] to avoid shifting effects with ecologically and economically detrimental consequences&quot;, with such &quot;border adjustments or eco-tariffs&quot; incentivizing other countries to adjust their standards and domestic production to join the climate club.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3390/su14074365&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement may lack enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1007/s10584-021-03082-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On a national level, penalties for non-complying countries could include:
* public reprimands
* economic sanctions
* denial of benefits, such as those related to travel, trade, and tourism
* public disclosures of compliance, which could act either as an incentive or penalty
* tariffs
Benefits for countries could include:
* tangible resources, such as financial aid or technical assistance
* other support
* access to data and information, recommendations and guidance, or other services provided by a governing body
* tariffs

==Selective enforcement==
Institutions may choose to exercise discretion, thereby enforcing laws, regulations, or norms only in selective circumstances. Some scholars, such as Joseph H. Tieger, have suggested that selective enforcement is an inherent component of all enforcement regimes, because it is impossible for enforcers to observe and catch every violation. Other scholars, such as Margaret H. Lemos and Alex Stein, have suggested that &quot;strategic&quot; enforcement is a cost-effective method of achieving social benefits; by focusing enforcement on the worst violators, other violators will &quot;downscale&quot; their activities so that they do not appear to be the worst offender.

<text>The Liechtenstein national football team () is the national football team of the Principality of Liechtenstein and is controlled by the Liechtenstein Football Association. The organisation is known as the &quot;Liechtensteiner Fussballverband&quot; in German. 

The team&#x27;s first match was an unofficial match against Malta in Seoul, a 1–1 draw in 1981. Their first official match came two years later, a 0–1 defeat from Switzerland. Liechtenstein&#x27;s largest win, a 4–0 win over Luxembourg in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 13 October 2004, was both its first away win and its first win in any FIFA World Cup qualifier.

Conversely, Liechtenstein is the only country that has lost official matches against San Marino – one in a 2004 friendly, and twice in the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League. Liechtenstein suffered its biggest ever loss in 1996, during 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, losing 1–11 to Macedonia (now North Macedonia), the result also being Macedonia&#x27;s largest ever win to date. The team&#x27;s head coach is currently Konrad Fünfstück.

==History==
Liechtenstein are only a relatively recent affiliate to FIFA, and did not participate in any qualifying series until the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifiers. There they managed to surprise the Republic of Ireland by holding them to a 0–0 draw on 3 June 1995. On 14 October 1998, they managed their first victory in a qualifying campaign after winning 2–1 against Azerbaijan in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying match.

Since then, the presence of Liechtenstein clubs in the Swiss league system and of a handful of professional players (most notably Mario Frick) has seen the side&#x27;s competitiveness improve slightly. The Euro 2004 qualifiers saw Liechtenstein improve to the extent they restricted England to 2–0 wins. Also at this time Liechtenstein lost 1–0 against San Marino, considered to be the weakest national team. The 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers brought even better results as two wins over Luxembourg and draws against both Slovakia and Portugal meant that Liechtenstein finished with 8 points.

In the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, Liechtenstein beat Latvia through a solitary goal from Mario Frick. The result caused the Latvian manager to resign after the match. They repeated their heroics against Iceland managing to beat them 3–0 on 17 October 2007 for their second qualifying group win. On 26 March 2008 Liechtenstein had an embarrassing 7–1 loss to fellow small nation in Europe, Malta. This was recorded as Malta&#x27;s largest win.

The Liechtensteiner Fussballverbund voted Rainer Hasler to be their &quot;Golden Player&quot; — their best player over the last 50 years — to mark UEFA&#x27;s golden jubilee.

In the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Liechtenstein secured a scoreless draw against Azerbaijan and a 1–1 draw against Finland, finishing bottom of Group 4 on two points.

In the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers, Liechtenstein were narrowly beaten 2–1 by Scotland in Hampden Park thanks to a goal by Stephen McManus in the seventh minute of additional time. They produced a shock 2–0 win at home against Lithuania; their goals were scored by Philippe Erne and Michele Polverino. In the following qualifying game, they managed a scoreless draw away to Lithuania.

In the qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the &quot;Blue-Reds&quot; were humiliated at home in their opening game against Bosnia-Herzegovina (1–8). The team loses many of its qualifying matches and earns its only two points in draws against Latvia and Slovakia. The team finished bottom of its group.

For the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign in France, Liechtenstein managed to finish second-bottom of the group and take five points, managing a goalless draw at home against Montenegro, an away win against Moldova, one goal to nil, thanks to Franz Burgmeier&#x27;s ninth goal and then a 1–1 home draw in the return against the same Moldovans, the group&#x27;s red lanterns with three fewer units.

During the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, The &quot;Blue-Reds&quot; lost all 10 of their matches and finished bottom of their group with no points scored and just one goal scored (away against Israel) compared to 39 conceded.

In 2018, Liechtenstein entered the first ever UEFA Nations League, in group 4 of league D. Their first Nations League match saw Armenia beat them 2–1 away. Liechtenstein were able to claim their first Nations League victory, beating Gibraltar 2–0 at home. Liechtenstein finished bottom of their group with just one win and a draw, also at home, against Armenia (2–2).

During the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, Liechtenstein managed to pick up two points thanks to two draws, one away to Greece (1–1) and the other at home to Armenia (1–1), but finished bottom of their group with 2 goals scored and 31 conceded.

In the 2020–21 edition of the Nations League, Liechtenstein failed to gain promotion to League C, with a single win (2–0 at San Marino), two draws (0–0 at home to San Marino and 1–1 at Gibraltar) and one defeat (0–1 at home to Gibraltar, their direct rival who eventually gained promotion). The &quot;Blue-Reds&quot; disappointed by failing to win a single match at home, once again falling behind Gibraltar in the standings as they had done in the previous edition, and being dominated overall in the goalless draw with San Marino.

The 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers once again saw Liechtenstein finish bottom of their group, with just one point from a 1–1 draw away to Armenia, and 9 defeats, with 2 goals scored and 34 conceded.

The 2022–23 edition of the UEFA Nations League was also a disappointment for Liechtenstein, who finished bottom of their group with 6 defeats in as many games played and just one goal scored, away against Andorra (1–2), their worst record in this competition in 3 editions. 

Liechtenstein began 2024 with four friendly matches, losing two and drawing two. One of the draws came away from home against Romania a few days prior to UEFA Euro 2024, a tournament which Romania had qualified for undefeated.

Liechtenstein began their 2024–25 Nations League campaign with a 0–1 loss away to San Marino after a Liechtenstein goal was denied through offside, handing the Sammarinese their first competitive victory. Following this, Liechtenstein proceeded to draw Gibraltar twice (2–2 away and 0–0 at home with a decisive penalty missed in the stoppage time during the return match against Gibraltar) before losing to San Marino again, this time 1–3 in Vaduz, finishing bottom of Group D1 on 2 points. Between the two draws with Gibraltar, Liechtenstein ended a 41-game winless streak with a 1–0 victory over Hong Kong.

== In literature ==
Prompted by the team&#x27;s poor record in competitive games, British writer Charlie Connelly followed the entire qualifying campaign for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. As recorded in the subsequent book &quot;Stamping Grounds: Liechtenstein&#x27;s Quest for the World Cup&quot;, Liechtenstein lost all eight games without scoring a goal.

<doc id="652705" wikidata="Q699680" url="?curid=652705" title="Hunsrückisch">
<text>Hunsrückisch is a German dialect spoken in the Hunsrück region of Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate). This mountainous region of Germany has long been an exporter of emigrants to Brazil, United States, Canada, Australia and other parts of the world.

Hunsrückisch was spoken in Edgar Reitz&#x27;s acclaimed television series &quot;Heimat&quot;.

== Geographical distribution ==
=== Germany ===
Whilst the Hunsrück region of Germany is well-defined, the distribution of Hunsrückisch itself is less so. On the one hand, the dialect extends beyond the Hunsrück area, but there are clear linguistic differences between the Hunsrückisch spoken in one locality and in another, and no uniform form of the dialect exists. That is made more difficult by the lack of written resources for the dialect. Since the 1990s, there has been an ongoing attempt to more scientifically document local dialects in the &quot;Mittelrheinischer Sprachatlas&quot;. The &quot;Rheinisches Wörterbuch&quot; entries of 1928–1971 have also been fully digitalised since then by the University of Trier.

As with almost all German dialects, the Hunsrückische dialect can be subdivided into many small local dialects, which each village having its own strand. The small-scale divisions of this linguistic area stem from how kingdoms in the Hunsrück area were often divided with borders that even cut through villages. The religious divisions in the predominantly protestant or catholic areas also contributed towards this linguistic separation.

A considerable and accelerated reversal of the active use of the Hunsrückisch dialect has also been noted. Younger generations sometimes no longer speak dialect and rarely understand unique words pertinent to that dialect. Societies dedicated to preserving local culture and history, as well as individuals themselves, have been trying to stem this trend via modern communication and documentation methods.

=== Brazil ===

There is a variation of the dialect in southern Brazil and in the southeastern state of Espírito Santo (municipalities of Marechal Floriano, Domingos Martins and Santa Leopoldina), named Hunsrik.

Throughout its almost 200-year history in southern Brazil and Espírito Santo, Hunsrückisch has been greatly influenced by other German dialects such as East Pomeranian, Swabian, and Austro-Bavarian; by other immigrant languages; and by Portuguese. Through Brazilian Portuguese, it has also incorporated Amerindian terminology, notably for fauna, flora and toponyms.

Brazilian Hunsrik is spoken in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, the nearby state of Santa Catarina, in other parts of southern Brazil like Paraná, and in the Southeast region such as Espírito Santo and São Paulo. It&#x27;s the second most spoken language in Brazil, after Portuguese.

==Features==

=== Phonology ===
Hunsrückisch can roughly be classed under two dialect sub-groups. The first of these is the Rhenish Franconian languages, for Hunsrückisch spoken from the Nahe (Rhine) until approximately just beyond Kastellaun. The second of these groups is Moselle Franconian, for Hunsrückisch spoken between Kastellaun and Moselle. The main linguistic characteristic which separates these two groups of Hunsrückisch is the &quot;dat/das&quot; divide. In the North, such as in Idar-Oberstein, Gemünden, Kirchberg, and Boppard, the definite article is pronounced &quot;dat.&quot; Roland Martin states, however, that a more important division between the groups is his proposed Bad Sobernheim Isogloss which focuses on the east and west. To the east, one hears &quot;Herrd&quot; (Hirte, &quot;shepherd)&quot;, &quot;Gorrjel&quot; (Gurgel, &quot;throat&quot;), and &quot;Rerre&quot; (Räder, &quot;wheels&quot;), whereas to the west &quot;Heerd, Goorjel,&quot; and &quot;Rierer&quot; are heard. Insertion of an epenthetic [ə] or [i] also occurs, with &quot;Dorf&quot; (village) becoming &quot;Dooref&quot;, &quot;Kirche&quot; (church) becoming &quot;Keerisch&quot;, and &quot;Berg&quot; (mountain) becoming &quot;Beerisch&quot;.

Georg Diener references other phonetic differences in different isoglosses. For example, in the west of Hunsrück &quot;o&quot; and &quot;eu&quot; are used, with &quot;u&quot; and &quot;au&quot; being used in the region east of the Mastershausen-Buch-Mannebach-Nörtershausen line: &quot;Bruure&quot; (Bruder, &quot;brother&quot;), &quot;Hau&quot; (Heu, &quot;hay&quot;). In the near east such as in Bubach, but not in Simmern, &quot;r&quot; is also pronounced as an apical consonant.

In Hunsrückisch &quot;d/t&quot; is often replaced with &quot;r,&quot; such as in &quot;Peere&quot; for &quot;Peter,&quot; or &quot;Fäärerre&quot; for &quot;Federn&quot; (feathers). When appearing between two vowels &quot;g&quot; is not pronounced, hence &quot;Aue&quot; (Augen &quot;eyes&quot;) and &quot;saan&quot; (sagen &quot;to say&quot;). The dialect is also notable for its openness of the mouth when being spoken, as evident in a local saying from Bubach:

* Hunsrückisch: &quot;Bräämerre: Et git kä brärer Blaad as en bräd, bräd Bräämerreblaad.&quot;
* Standard German: Brombeeren: Es gibt kein breiteres Blatt als ein breites, breites, Brombeerblatt.
* English: There is no wider leaf than a wide, wide, blackberry leaf.

=== Grammar ===
The grammatical rules of Hunsrückisch resemble those of Standard German.

==== Gender ====
In contrast to the Standard language, &quot;Bach&quot; (stream) and &quot;Salat&quot; (salad) are feminine and not masculine—&quot;die Bach&quot;, &quot;die Salaad&quot; instead of &quot;der Bach, der Salat&quot;. Feminine &quot;die&quot; &quot;Brille&quot; (glasses) and &quot;die Butter&quot; become masculine &quot;de Brill&quot; and &quot;de Bodder&quot; in Hunsrückisch.

Female referents are usually of the masculine gender, such as &quot;de Marri&quot; (Maria), &quot;de Suffi&quot; (Sophia). &quot;Die Fraa&quot; (Frau &quot;woman&quot;) becomes neuter, like in &quot;dat Fraamensch&quot; (lit. &quot;the woman-human&quot;), when appended with -&quot;mensch.&quot; Diminutives of women&#x27;s names are also neuter like in Standard German—&quot;dat Kattche&quot; (Katharina)—but are also often complemented with the name of the locality in which they reside, or with a family name.

==== Tenses ====
In Hunsrückisch the perfect tenses are predominantly used. The preterite is reserved for only a small number of verbs, such as &quot;saht&quot; (sagte &quot;said&quot;) and &quot;fung&quot; (fing, &quot;caught&quot;). Conjugation largely occurs on the basis of Standard German conjugation. 

==== Cases ====
As is extant in Standard German, the Nominative, Accusative, and Dative are present in Hunsrückisch. The genitive case, as often comes to be in German dialects, is not used and is replaced with the dative plus a form of the third-person personal pronoun. Thus &quot;dessen Bruder&quot; becomes &quot;dämm seine Brorer&quot;.

==== Plural Formation ====
In all cases except one, plural formation is identical to that of Standard German. The only exception occurs when the Standard German plural form is &quot;-en,&quot; in which case the plural in Hunsrückisch is &quot;-e&quot;.

* &quot;die Zeitung, die&quot; Zeitungen (the newspaper, the newspapers) &gt; &quot;die Zeidung, die Zeidunge&quot;.

=== Regionalisms ===
A number of words occur in Hunsrückisch which are either not found in Standard German, or occur rarely/in different contexts in Standard German.
==Other influences==
Because of its proximity to France, the Hunsrückisch dialect spoken in the Hunsrück region has experienced unique influences from the neighbouring French through the centuries. During Napoleonic times, the Hunsrück region was briefly incorporated into France.

<doc id="652707" wikidata="Q6056768" url="?curid=652707" title="Intersession">
<text>Intersession is a short break or mini-term between the traditional, standard academic terms. An intersession may be a period of a few weeks between semesters or quarters during which students can take short, accelerated classes or complete other academic work.

== Examples ==
At Johns Hopkins University, intersession is a &quot;period of about three weeks in January set aside for voluntary activity on the part of both faculty and students.&quot; Most of the courses are unique to Intersession, not offered during the fall, spring, or summer semesters. Students have many options to pursue during intersession. Many courses are traditional classroom courses that fall under the category of &quot;Academic Exploration&quot;. Other courses fulfill different purposes and fall under other categories; these include &quot;Leading Social Change&quot;, &quot;Career Development&quot;, and &quot;Personal Enrichment&quot;. During this time, students can also choose to study abroad or elsewhere in the United States. Freshmen students at Johns Hopkins are also eligible for the B&#x27;More program, where participants select a course whose content relates to the Baltimore&#x27;s history, culture, politics or health issues. 

At Princeton University, the intersession is the week-long break for students following their first semester exams. Because exams are conducted after the holiday break in the month of January, Intersession provides a respite before beginning the second semester&#x27;s studies.

At Washington &amp; Jefferson College, Intersession is a three-week term in January. During the Intersession term, students have the choice of studying abroad, completing an external internship, or taking a specially-designed Intersession course. These Intersession courses are more focused than regular courses and provide professors with an opportunity to teach non-traditional subjects. Past Intersession courses have included &quot;Emerging Diseases: Global and Local&quot; in the biology department, &quot;Corporate Failures, Frauds, and Scandals&quot; in the business department, and &quot;Vampires and Other Bloodsuckers&quot; in the English department, &quot;Holocaust Survivor Narratives&quot; in the German department, and &quot;Alternative Radio&quot; in the communications department.

<doc id="652714" wikidata="Q3470840" url="?curid=652714" title="Blackhawk, California">
<text>Blackhawk is an unincorporated planned community and census-designated place located in Contra Costa County, California, United States, east of Danville and Oakland. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 9,354. Governed by county rules/regulations and a homeowner association (HOA), Blackhawk has a country club, two golf courses, sports complex, restaurants, and the adjacent Blackhawk Plaza. 24-hour security plus additional law enforcement contracted through the Contra Costa County Sheriff&#x27;s Office is provided by HOA dues. The area is covered by the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District. The ZIP code is 94506. The community is inside area code 925. Blackhawk is known for its uniform architecture and suburban lifestyle, with the median household income being $167,875 and median home price of $1,117,500.

==Blackhawk Ranch, 1917 to 1979==
Blackhawk Ranch was established in 1917 by Ansel Mills Easton and his son-in-law William Q. Ward, in an area east of the San Ramon and Sycamore Valleys. The name came from a famous Irish racehorse named Blackhawk that Easton&#x27;s family had once owned. The land passed through the hands of several owners, including Raymond Force (the owner of the Caterpillar Tractor Company), the Hawaii-based sugar and pineapple company Castle &amp; Cooke and Howard Peterson (owner of Peterson Tractor).

In 1975, Peterson sold the land to Florida developer Ken Behring, who planned a housing development of 4800 dwelling units over of land. Critics charged that the plan would have various negative impacts, related to urban sprawl, environmental damage and violations of the County General Plan. A group of environmentalists and local residents called Amigos de Diablo organized against the Blackhawk Development Corporation, but were sued for libel. The Blackhawk Development Corporation finally reduced the number of homes planned to 2400 and offered more than of open space to Mount Diablo State Park.

==Communities==

Blackhawk is divided into seven individual gated communities scattered along Blackhawk Road, connected by a long jogging trail.

* Hidden Oaks consists of 206 homes and in 1978 was the first Blackhawk community to be completed. Most homes are on half-acre lots.
* Oakridge consists of medium-sized homes ranging from 2000 to , though a few large estates reside on the top of a private court.
* Saddleback, the second community completed, is home to some of the most lavish homes in the entire Blackhawk development, most lots being no less than in size.
* Silveroak is an upscale condo complex.
* Silver Maple is designed around one of the main Blackhawk Country Clubs&#x27;s golf holes, though no roads connect it to the rest of the main Blackhawk Country Club. It consists of approximately 110 custom homes between 2500-5000 Square Feet.
* Blackhawk Country Club (&quot;Main Gates&quot;) is the largest of the six communities.

<text>Audio Units (AU) are a system-level plug-in architecture provided by Core Audio in Apple&#x27;s macOS and iOS operating systems. Audio Units are a set of application programming interface (API) services provided by the operating system to generate, process, receive, or otherwise manipulate streams of audio in near-real-time with minimal latency. It may be thought of as Apple&#x27;s architectural equivalent to another popular plug-in format, Steinberg&#x27;s Virtual Studio Technology (VST).

Because of the many similarities between Audio Units and VST, several commercial and free wrapping technologies are available (e.g. Symbiosis and FXpansion VST-AU Adapter). Celemony Software and PreSonus have also developed the Audio Random Access (ARA) extension, which works for both AU and VST, allowing greater integration between the plug-ins and DAW software.

== Use ==
Audio Units allows sound file audio time stretching and pitch scaling (e.g., timestretch), sample rate conversion, and streaming over a local area network. It also comes with a set of AU plug-ins such as EQ filters, dynamic processors, delay, reverb, and a Soundbank Synthesizer Instrument.
AU are used by Apple applications such as GarageBand, Soundtrack Pro, Logic Express, Logic Pro, Logic Pro X, Final Cut Pro, MainStage and most 3rd party audio software developed for macOS such as Ableton Live, Amadeus Pro, Ardour, Audio Hijack, DaVinci Resolve, Digital Performer, Gig Performer, REAPER, and Studio One.

== Competing technologies ==
*Avid&#x27;s Avid Audio eXtension (a successor to the RTAS format)
*Digidesign&#x27;s Real Time AudioSuite (now obsolete)
*LADSPA and Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI) for Linux
*LV2 (crossplatform successor to LADSPA)
*Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX
*Steinberg&#x27;s Virtual Studio Technology

<doc id="652717" wikidata="Q1752207" url="?curid=652717" title="All rights reserved">
<text>&quot;All rights reserved&quot; is a phrase that originated in copyright law as part of copyright notices. It indicates that the copyright holder &quot;reserves&quot;, or holds for their own use, all the rights provided by copyright law, such as distribution, performance, and creation of derivative works; that is, they have not waived any such right. Copyright law in most countries no longer requires such notices, but the phrase persists. The original understanding of the phrase as relating specifically to copyright may have been supplanted by common usage of the phrase to refer to any legal right, although it is probably understood to refer &quot;at least&quot; to copyright. 

In the past, the phrase was required as a result of the Buenos Aires Convention of 1910 which mandated that some statement of reservation of rights be made in order to secure protection in signatory countries of the convention. It was required to add the phrase as a written notice that all rights granted under existing copyright law (such as the right to publish a work within a specific area) were retained by the copyright holder and that legal action might be taken against infringement.

Since copyright law is neither straightforward nor widely understood in its details – nor is the Buenos Aires Convention&#x27;s previous requirement, and the current deprecation of the phrase, common or lay knowledge, it continues to hold popular currency and serve as a notionally-useful convention widely used by artists, writers, directors, photographers, designers, and other content-creators with the intention that it should function as both sign and warning that the content alongside which it appears cannot be copied freely. It is unclear, however, if the phrase has any legal effect in any jurisdiction. In spite of this, its popular use continues.

== Origins ==
The phrase originated as a result of the Buenos Aires Convention of 1910. Article 3 of the Convention granted copyright in all signatory countries to a work registered in any signatory country, as long as a statement &quot;that indicates the &quot;reservation&quot; of the property &quot;right&quot;&quot; (emphasis added) appeared in the work. The phrase &quot;all rights reserved&quot; was not specified in the text, but met this requirement.

Other copyright treaties did not require this formality. For example, in 1952 the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) adopted the © symbol as an indicator of protection. (The symbol was introduced in the US by a 1954 amendment to the Copyright Act of 1909.) The Berne Convention rejected formalities altogether in Article 4 of the 1908 revision, so authors seeking to protect their works in countries that had signed on to the Berne Convention were also not required to use the &quot;all rights reserved&quot; formulation. However, because not all Buenos Aires signatories were members of Berne or the UCC, and in particular the United States did not join UCC until 1955, a publisher in a Buenos Aires signatory seeking to protect a work in the greatest number of countries between 1910 and 1952 would have used both the phrase &quot;all rights reserved&quot; and the copyright symbol.

== Obsolescence ==
The requirement to add the &quot;all rights reserved&quot; notice became essentially obsolete on August 23, 2000, when Nicaragua became the final member of the Buenos Aires Convention to also become a signatory to the Berne Convention. As of that date, every country that was a member of the Buenos Aires Convention (which is the only copyright treaty requiring this notice to be used) was also a member of Berne, which requires protection be granted without any formality of notice of copyright.

<doc id="652721" wikidata="Q3163212" url="?curid=652721" title="Jay Bell">
<text>Jay Stuart Bell (born December 11, 1965) is an American former Major League Baseball shortstop and former manager of the Rocket City Trash Pandas of the Southern League. He played for the Cleveland Indians (1986–1988), Pittsburgh Pirates (1989–1996), Kansas City Royals (1997), Arizona Diamondbacks (1998–2002) and New York Mets (2003). He was the bench coach for the Cincinnati Reds, and was the bench coach for the New Zealand national baseball team that competed in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

==Playing career==
Bell played his high school baseball at J.M. Tate High School, located in Cantonment, Florida. A first-round pick of the Minnesota Twins in 1984, Bell made 129 errors over his first three minor-league seasons. The following year he was traded to the Cleveland Indians in a deal that brought starter Bert Blyleven to the Twins. When he finally reached the majors in 1986, he faced Blyleven in his first major-league at-bat. During this moment, Bell ripped the first pitch he saw from Blyleven for a home run.

Bell maintained his reputation as one of the best shortstops in the 1990s. His range may have been considered average but he had a great knowledge of the hitters and positioned himself well. He won a Gold Glove Award in 1993, breaking a string of thirteen straight National League Gold Gloves at shortstop by Ozzie Smith. It was also the first Gold Glove by a Pirate shortstop since Gene Alley&#x27;s back-to-back honors in 1966 and 1967. Though mostly a singles and doubles hitter at first, Bell was also an expert at bunting. Bell did show early signs of his power potential hitting 21 home runs in 1997 and 20 in 1998. A trial switch to second base at end of the &#x27;98 season became a permanent move the next spring. Bell belted 36 of his 38 homers from his new position, a total exceeded only by Rogers Hornsby, Davey Johnson and Ryne Sandberg among second basemen. One of those round-trippers was a sixth-inning grand slam off the Oakland Athletics pitcher Jimmy Haynes on the final game before the All-Star break, which won $1 million for an Arizona fan, Gylene Hoyle, who had correctly predicted the batter and the inning for a bases-loaded blast. Bell won the World Series with the Diamondbacks in 2001, serving as the winning run in Game 7 when he reached base on a ninth-inning bunt before Luis Gonzalez singled to deliver a walk-off series victory over the New York Yankees.

In his career, Bell batted .265, with 195 home runs, 868 runs batted in, 1,123 runs scored, 1,964 hits, 394 doubles, 67 triples and 91 stolen bases. As a player, Bell was well known for wearing eyeglasses on the field.

==Coaching career==
After the season, Bell retired as bench coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks in order to spend more time with his family, who are located in Phoenix, Arizona and Tampa, Florida. He currently has a ballfield named after him in Phoenix, called Jay Bell Field. He became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received 0.4% of the vote and dropped off the ballot.

Bell serves as a member of the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro league players through financial and medical difficulties. In 2012, he served as the hitting coach for the Mobile BayBears, the Double–A affiliate of the Diamondbacks. Bell was hired as the hitting coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates on October 31, 2012. On November 11, 2013, Bell was named bench coach of the Cincinnati Reds. On October 22, 2015, it was announced that the Reds would not renew Bell&#x27;s contract. On January 13, 2017, Bell became the manager for the High–A Tampa Yankees.

On August 29, 2017, Bell became the manager of the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League. On January 25, 2018, Bell was named the manager of the Trenton Thunder, the New York Yankees&#x27; Double–A affiliate, and in 2019 he was promoted to manager of the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, the Yankees&#x27; Triple–A affiliate. On January 6, 2020, Bell was announced as the manager of the Rocket City Trash Pandas, the Double–A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels, for their inaugural season. Rocket City took the place of the relocated Mobile BayBears. He left following the 2021 season.

<doc id="652733" wikidata="Q1486643" url="?curid=652733" title="Pronic number">
<text>A pronic number is a number that is the product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number of the form formula_1. The study of these numbers dates back to Aristotle. They are also called oblong numbers, heteromecic numbers, or rectangular numbers; however, the term &quot;rectangular number&quot; has also been applied to the composite numbers.

The first 60 pronic numbers are:

:0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, 132, 156, 182, 210, 240, 272, 306, 342, 380, 420, 462, 506, 552, 600, 650, 702, 756, 812, 870, 930, 992, 1056, 1122, 1190, 1260, 1332, 1406, 1482, 1560, 1640, 1722, 1806, 1892, 1980, 2070, 2162, 2256, 2352, 2450, 2550, 2652, 2756, 2862, 2970, 3080, 3192, 3306, 3422, 3540, 3660... .

Letting formula_2 denote the pronic number formula_1, we have formula_4.

== Additional properties==
Pronic numbers are even, and 2 is the only prime pronic number. It is also the only pronic number in the Fibonacci sequence and the only pronic Lucas number.

The arithmetic mean of two consecutive pronic numbers is a square number:
:formula_5
So there is a square between any two consecutive pronic numbers. It is unique, since
:formula_6
Another consequence of this chain of inequalities is the following property. If is a pronic number, then the following holds:
:formula_7

The fact that consecutive integers are coprime and that a pronic number is the product of two consecutive integers leads to a number of properties. Each distinct prime factor of a pronic number is present in only one of the factors or . Thus a pronic number is squarefree if and only if and are also squarefree. The number of distinct prime factors of a pronic number is the sum of the number of distinct prime factors of and .

If 25 is appended to the decimal representation of any pronic number, the result is a square number, the square of a number ending on 5; for example, 625 = 252 and 1225 = 352. This is so because

:formula_8.

The difference between two consecutive unit fractions is the reciprocal of a pronic number:

:formula_9

<doc id="652737" wikidata="Q3192876" url="?curid=652737" title="Kaput and Zösky">
<text>Kaput and Zösky: The Ultimate Obliterators is an animated television series based on the comic book series from the cartoonist Lewis Trondheim called &quot;Kaput et Zösky&quot;. 26 episodes were produced.

Some of the stories featured in the comics have been converted into the series that ran on weekends and late at night in the United States on Nicktoons, Australia on ABC 2, United Kingdom on Channel 4 and in Canada on Teletoon.

==Premise==
Bloodthirsty conquerors, Kaput and Zösky travel the universe, landing on planets and trying to conquer them. They are not the most able tyrants, however, and have trouble holding any planet for more than a few days, if they can even manage to dominate it in the first place. In fact, they spend as much time running for their lives as they do enslaving and slaughtering innocents. Kaput and Zösky are a dynamic, if generic, duo. Zösky is a cunning, level-headed pseudo-intellectual who always has a plan. Kaput, on the other hand, is short-tempered and volatile; his strategies always involve &quot;crisperizing&quot; everything in sight. Kaput is a short and dumpy little terrorizer with a brilliant red mohawk, and Zösky is a tall and thin tyrant with a set of yellow antennae. Their exploits almost always end in the same way for the two space tyrants; the two barely escape from their fates by flying off in their dumpy little spaceship, leaving a red smoke trail behind.

==Characters==
Kaput – Kaput is the short and fat one of the duo, and the exact reverse of Zösky. While Zösky is clean, methodical, and thorough, Kaput is all mayhem and prefers to fire at will. He has red hair in the shape of an unruly mohawk and a prominent underbite. His crisperizer is red as are the buttons on his outfit, and he has short boots. Kaput is considered an object of derision to most, due to his fat body and his manner. He is also allergic to moles and swells up when he is near them. Kaput is voiced by Rick Jones.

Zösky – Zösky is the thin one of the duo, and more of the planner. He seems to be well-versed on matters beyond Kaput&#x27;s control, and is quite easily agitated by Kaput&#x27;s mayhem and discord. His home planet is Lamamma, He also wishes to first use his mind to dominate rather than brute force. Zösky is tall and thin, has yellow antennae which resemble bunny ears, and squinted eyes. His crisperizer and the buttons on his shirt are yellow, and sports tall boots. To some characters in the show, Zösky is considered attractive, perhaps due to his British accent and his suavè manners. Zösky can&#x27;t stand carrots, contrary to some characters believing that he is a rabbit and thus likes them. Zösky is voiced by Mark Camacho.

===Minor characters===
Crazy Joe – A crazed, dirty mercenary, Crazy Joe is after Kaput and Zösky to try to &quot;cream them&quot;. It was never revealed what he had against them, but it possibly has to do with Kaput borrowing a massive amount of money off of Crazy Joe. He was brainwashed so that he would be little more than a lackey to them, but soon came to his senses and resumed his pursuit of the two. He is shown being short and having the same build as Kaput as well as being tan and having tentacles at the bottom of his body. His ship resembles Kaput and Zösky&#x27;s ship. Some events had occurred in the show where the deranged villain was forced to join forces with Kaput and Zösky, such as the instance where the three were sent to a mental asylum.

Office Lady – The Office Lady helps the two on their assumption of power on the office planet. She is a character which is dressed in a suit and wears an air helmet. She translates all of the employee complaints to Kaput and Zösky. Towards the end of her appearance, she advised the two to leave before lawyers came to &quot;instigate proceedings on work-equipment deterioration and attempted intimidation&quot;. The Office Lady is voiced by Helen King.

The Great Ghandizen – The Great Ghandizen is a squat, little ruler with an arsenal of crushing devices with which to crush offenders. He made a massive amount of contributions to his planet and is long-lived, being about 600 years old. The Great Ghandizen is voiced by John Stocker.

Marvin the Enchanter – Marvin is a birdlike, bespectacled wizard with a white beard famed for his ability to perform magic of an awesome ability. He assists Kaput in trying to take the crown of the planet by magically attaching the sword Exkaliput, a clear parody of Excalibur to his hand. Marvin is also a play on Merlin of King Arthur lore. Marvin the Enchanter is voiced by John Stocker.

Bobo Bibola – Bobo Bibola is a genie who is the denizen of a lamp which very seldom opens. He is against granting Kaput and Zösky wishes because he is tired of doing favors when he gets nothing in return. Bobo Bibola is voiced by John Stocker.

Ghost King – The Ghost King is not exactly dead, nor alive, but he is invisible and considered a ghost. He takes control of inanimate objects because he lacks a body. He is also furious at Kaput and Zösky for ruining his kingdom.

El Kinga – The current ruler of Diskotekus and a good dancer, El Kinga is a large two-headed ruler, one head sports a pompadour and the other, blond hair. This ruler is not only the leader of his/her planet, but also the most revered dancer.

Ichabob the Liberator – A native to a planet held in discord for many years, Ichabob is commonly known as Ichabob the Liberator. He has a long, unkempt beard and tattered clothes from staying underground for so many years. He was unwittingly freed from prison by Kaput and Zösky when he pretended to be a crazed prisoner. He speaks in a strong Scottish accent.

Max – Like many of the other characters, Max made only one appearance in the show. He is a cheery and helpful mechanic who installs a travelling device in the ship belonging to Kaput and Zösky. He wears traditional mechanic garb and speaks with a New York accent. With his moderation, the two conquerors made it to uncharted lands far away from the rest of the galaxy.

Mermaid Queen – The Mermaid Queen is a large, corpulent sea creature who is the queen of the planet H2O. She was shown as the bride to Kaput when he was forced to marry the queen in order to gain the crown. She speaks in a strong New York accent in the voice of a man. When angered, she emits a large, blinding cloud of ink, like an octopus.

Boudini – Boudini is a wizard of the planet Hokus Pokus. He is the ruler and an accomplished magician. He wears a pointed black outfit as well as a magic scepter with which to perform magic of all varieties. Boudini had plans for Zösky, in the hopes of disappearing him, for he thought that Zösky was a rabbit. Kaput rescued Zösky by dressing like a woman, who had caught Boudini&#x27;s eye, because there were no more women on Hokus Pokus. Boudini was converted into a large, savage beast when Kaput stole his scepter and has apparently remained that way since.

&quot;Cabbie&quot; – The cabbie is a sluglike character who speaks with a strong New York accent and drives the two conquerors around on Rycta Ryctim, while bearing in mind the planet&#x27;s cardinal rule; obey the traffic signs. He refers to Kaput and Zösky as &quot;touristás&quot;.

Heads and Tails – These two (they are two different personalities with one body) are the instruction manual of the planet Gamma Blorg, and are conjoined twins. One speaks in a strong English accent and has a tiara as well as red hair, is named Heads, and the other, Tails is a moose head with a Canadian accent. They argue continuously and have a cauldron as a body.

==Show history==
&quot;Kaput and Zösky: The Ultimate Obliterators&quot; had made its debut sometime on September 3, 2002, though when it is not revealed exactly, but for a short time, this show had made a niche in TeleToon and Nicktoons Network. While it was shown on Nicktoons, most of the episodes that were made were exempted from airing until sometime in January 2007, when &quot;new episodes&quot; had made their way onto the network. In total 26 half-hour episodes (78 shorts) were produced.

==Home media==
There were four Kaput and Zösky DVDs released in 2005 by Filmoption International and Direct Source Special Product Inc. The DVDs include 8 episodes each and are very rare to find. The DVDs include episodes that were not aired on Nicktoons Network until late in the show&#x27;s run as they were considered &quot;unsuitable for television.&quot; Between late 2013 and early 2014 though, the entire series was released to Starz Media&#x27;s YouTube page.

<text>MacLeod, McLeod and Macleod ( ) are surnames in the English language. The names are anglicised forms of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;son of Leòd&quot;, derived from the Old Norse &quot;Liótr&quot; (&quot;ugly&quot;).

One of the earliest occurrences of the surname is of Gillandres MacLeod, in 1227. There are two recognised Scottish clans with the surname: Clan MacLeod of Harris and Skye, and Clan MacLeod of Lewis and Raasay. The earliest record of these two families, using a form of the surname &quot;MacLeod&quot;, occurs in the mid 14th century.

There are also documented cases of Scottish missionaries in Canada using McLeod as an Anglicisation of the indigenous Cree language name &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;the big one&quot;), which accounts for its occurrence amongst Canadian people of Cree heritage.

<text>The Illini Media Company is a nonprofit, student media company based in Champaign, Illinois. The company owns several student-run media outlets associated with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign: the general newspaper, the &quot;Daily Illini&quot;; the entertainment paper, &quot;Buzz Magazine&quot;; the engineering quarterly, &quot;Technograph&quot;; the U of I yearbook, the &quot;Illio&quot;; and the commercial radio station, WPGU.

The Illini Publishing Company was chartered by the State of Illinois in 1911. In 1984, it became the Illini Media Company. The company helps students prepare for and careers in print media and broadcasting and to inform and entertain the University of Illinois community. Revenues exceed $2.5 million.

In 2012, the Illini Media sought support to keep its business running. Prominent alumni, such as film critic Roger Ebert, urged alumni to donate to the corporation. Additionally, a referendum passed to allow a fee on student&#x27;s tuition to go towards the company.

==Location==
The Illini Media Company is housed at what was previously the Illini Media Building, located at 512 East Green Street in Champaign. Illini Media has since sold the building and moved all of its units to the third floor.

==Media==
===&quot;Daily Illini&quot;===

The &quot;Daily Illini&quot; (commonly known as the DI) is a student-run newspaper that has been published for the community of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign since 1871. Weekday circulation during fall and spring semesters is 20,000; copies are distributed free at more than 200 locations throughout Champaign-Urbana.

Although the Daily Illini claims to be &quot;The independent student newspaper...since 1871,&quot; questions about the independence of Illini Media arose after the student fee was imposed – it is estimated that revenue from mandatory student fees accounts for &quot;10-12% of Illini Media&#x27;s annual budget.&quot;

===WPGU 107.1===

WPGU 107.1 is a fully commercial student-run radio station located at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It is operational 24-7, broadcasting alternative music and other programming throughout Champaign-Urbana and surrounding communities.

===&quot;Buzz Magazine&quot;===
&quot;Buzz&quot; is a weekly entertainment magazine published every Friday by the Illini Media Company. The magazine was previously included as a weekly insert in &quot;The Daily Illini&quot;, but is now considered a stand-alone publication. &quot;Buzz&quot; is the only alt-weekly print publication in Champaign-Urbana. Covering film, television, music and theatre reviews, and local events, &quot;Buzz&quot; contains feature stories on the local entertainment scene.

===&quot;Illio Yearbook&quot;===
&quot;Illio&quot; is the official yearbook of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Since 1894, &quot;Illio&quot; has been documenting and preserving the campus through yearbooks. Today&#x27;s yearbook has many different sections, including Groups &amp; Greeks, Campus Life, Senior Pictures, and more.

===&quot;Technograph Magazine&quot;===
&quot;Technograph&quot; is an engineering quarterly at the University of Illinois. It began in 1855 as the &quot;Selected Papers of the Civil Engineers&#x27; Club of the University of Illinois&quot;. The magazine covers engineering and new technology and features profiles of leaders in the field. &quot;Technograph&quot; is available as a quarterly insert in the &quot;Daily Illini&quot;. Additionally, more than 1,000 copies are sent to high school libraries across the state of Illinois.

==Famous alumni==

* Iris Chang, author of the international best-seller, &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;, was a features writer for the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; from 1987-89.
* Roger Ebert, film critic, was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; in 1963–64, when he attended the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He also worked for Illini Media&#x27;s terrestrial radio station WPGU.
* Hugh Hefner, editor in chief and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, worked as a cartoonist for the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; from 1946 to 1949.
* Will Leitch, editor of the online magazine &quot;Deadspin&quot; and author of &quot;God Save The Fan&quot;, was the managing editor of the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; in 1996.

==Competition==
&quot;The Hub&quot;, published between April 2004 and October 2006, was the last of a series of non-university affiliated alternative weeklies that competed with Illini Media. Previous alternative weeklies include &quot;The Paper&quot;, closed in 2004; &quot;The Octopus&quot; (under Yesse! Communications and then under the Saga Communications radio conglomerate), published from 1995–2002; &quot;C-U Cityview&quot;, 2002–2003; and &quot;The Optimist&quot;, 1994–1995.

<text>Tahoe City (formerly Tahoe) is an unincorporated town in Placer County, California. Tahoe City is located on the shore of Lake Tahoe, at the outlet of the Truckee River.

The site was surveyed in 1863, and Tahoe House was built in 1864. The Tahoe post office opened in 1871, closed for a period in 1896, and changed its name to Tahoe City in 1949. The ZIP Code is 96145. For statistical purposes, Tahoe City is included in the Sunnyside-Tahoe City census-designated place (CDP).

==Climate==
Due to its high elevation, Tahoe City has a dry-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;) with dry summers featuring very warm days and cool nights, plus chilly winters with regular snowfall. The annual snowfall of (&quot;median&quot; snowfall is ) is remarkable for a place with only twelve days typically not topping freezing: it is indeed so heavy that the mean maximum snow depth is as high as despite much melting and refreezing due to persistent freeze/thaw cycles. As a comparison, higher, colder, but drier Bodie has a mean maximum snow depth of only – three-fifths that of Tahoe City. The heaviest daily snowfall in Tahoe City was on January 15, 1952, and again on April 3, 1958, and the most in a season between July 1937 and June 1938. The most snow on the ground has been on March 20, 1952, and snow usually melts except in abnormally wet years during April; however there remained as much as on the ground on average during May 1967 after a wet winter.

During summer, Tahoe City is generally dry; though thunderstorms may bring rain to the region. As is typical for the region, summer days are very warm and sunny, but nights can be chilly and temperatures below have occasionally been reported even in July and August: on July 1, 1975, the temperature fell as low as . The hottest temperature reported in Tahoe City is on August 15, 1933, and the coldest on December 11 of 1972; although on average only 1.4 nights per winter will fall to or under , 204.3 nights on average fall to or below freezing and only five nights stay above , with no occurrence of so high a minimum known between October 9 and May 29 inclusive.

<doc id="652758" wikidata="Q304049" url="?curid=652758" title="Hunsrik">
<text>Hunsrik (natively &quot;Hunsrik&quot; , &quot;Hunsrückisch&quot; or &quot;Hunsrickisch&quot; and Portuguese &quot;hunsriqueano&quot; or &quot;hunsriqueano riograndense&quot;), also called Riograndese Hunsrik, or , is a Moselle Franconian language derived primarily from the Hunsrückisch dialect of West Central German which is spoken in parts of South America. A co-official language in the Brazilian municipalities of Antônio Carlos, Santa Maria do Herval, and São João do Oeste,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lei Nº 1.685/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hunsrik is spoken in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paraná, as well as some regions of neighboring Paraguay and Argentina. It has been an integral part of the historical and cultural heritage of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul since 2012, and considered an intangible cultural heritage of Santa Catarina state since 2016.

Hunsrik developed from the Hunsrückisch dialect spoken by immigrants from the Hunsrück region of Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland) who settled in Brazil&#x27;s southern region such as Rio Grande do Sul, beginning under the Empire of Brazil in 1824. This immigration later fell under the control of individual states, and then of private European investment enterprises. While primarily based on the Hunsrückisch branch of the German language, it has also been greatly influenced by other German dialects such as East Pomeranian and Plautdietsch and by Portuguese, the national language of Brazil. It has been influenced to a lesser extent by indigenous languages such as Kaingang and Guarani and by immigrant languages such as Italian and Talian.

Portuguese expressions and words are commonly imported into Hunsrik, particularly in reference to fauna and flora (which are different from those of Germany) and to technological innovations that did not exist when the original immigrants came to Brazil, leading to words like for airplane (Portuguese ) instead of , (Pt. , truck) instead of , (Pt. ) instead of , etc. Daily expressions are often calques (literal translations) of Portuguese.

Also common are the use of German suffixes attached to Portuguese words, such as , &quot;little mug,&quot; from Portuguese , &quot;mug,&quot; and German diminutive suffix ( in Hunsrik); hybrid forms such as , &quot;shoe shop,&quot; from German and Portuguese , and Germanized forms of Portuguese verbs: , &quot;to remember&quot;; &quot;to flirt&quot;; , &quot;to answer&quot; (Portuguese , , and ). However, regardless of these borrowings, its grammar and vocabulary are still largely Germanic.

Although Hunsrik is the most common Germanic language in south Brazil, the use of this language—particularly in the last three to four generations—continues to decrease. Glottolog classifies the language as &quot;shifting&quot; on its Agglomerated Endangerment Status.

== History ==

=== In Germany ===
The Hunsrückisch dialect, from which Hunsrik derived, has its origins in the Moselle Franconian dialects spoken in the Hunsrück region, on the banks of the Rhine and Moselle rivers, in western Germany. Germany, as a national state, only unified in 1871, so the standard German existing today was, until the 19th century, a literary language, the one used by Martin Luther in his famous translation of the Bible. The German people, in their daily lives, did not use standard German to communicate, but several regional dialects.

Until around 1800, Standard German was primarily a written language in Germany. Standard German was often learned as a foreign language and had an uncertain pronunciation. With the country&#x27;s unification process and the mass literacy of the population, standard German has become the language used by speakers of different dialects to understand each other, although regional dialects have remained the language used at home.

=== In Brazil ===
With German immigration to Brazil, over the past two centuries, German dialects have also come to establish themselves as a regional language. However, something curious happened: while in Germany standard German served for speakers of different dialects to communicate, in Brazil, due to the still incipient consolidation of standard German when immigration started, this role was played by the Hunsrückisch dialect. There are two hypotheses for this phenomenon. The first because most immigrants would have come from Hunsrück, so their dialect predominated. The second because Hunsrückisch has intermediate features between the different German dialects, so it served as a koiné between speakers of various dialects. What is known is that German immigrants in Brazil came from different parts of Germany, so Hunsrik-speaking Brazilians do not necessarily descend from people from Hunsrück. In these German communities, the Hunsrückisch dialect remained the main language of communication for several decades. German colonies in the South were usually formed in regions of forest depopulated or inhabited by Indians, who were expelled for the arrival of immigrants. Due to this isolation, the Germans managed to create a &quot;linguistic island&quot;, in which German was the main language, and not Portuguese. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were hundreds of thousands of second- and third-generation German-Brazilians who could barely speak Portuguese. This differentiation favored the feeling of a minority group, which allied itself with the formation of solid ethnic institutions, such as schools, churches, social associations and a German-language press. All of these elements combined promoted a general feeling of &quot;cultural group&quot;.

In 1930, there were 2,500 ethnic schools in Brazil. Of these, 1,579 were from German immigrants. In these schools, children learned the standard German that is spread in Germany. This linguistic and cultural isolation was combated aggressively by the nationalist government of then Brazil&#x27;s president Getúlio Vargas, through the nationalization campaign. All German schools in the country were closed, annihilating the German-Brazilian middle school. The standard German learned at school was thus eliminated, greatly weakening the use of German in urban centers, which became limited to the countryside. People were harassed and beaten if they spoke German on the street. The police inspected people&#x27;s private lives, breaking into houses to burn books written in German, or languages other than Portuguese. Many people were arrested for the simple fact that they speak German. In 1942, 1.5% of the inhabitants of Blumenau were imprisoned for speaking German. The closure of schools has caused people to become increasingly attached to the German dialect used in everyday life, far from standard German.

== Language name ==
The language has two main names—&quot;Hunsrik&quot; and &quot;Hunsrückisch—&quot;because it initially lacked an official grammar and is not governed by a centralized entity. One of the first efforts to standardize the language was done by Adriano Steffler, who developed a &quot;Hunsrik Grammar,&quot; &quot;Hunsrik Dictionary,&quot; and an alphabet. His 45-character alphabet is a combination of the Latin alphabet (all except Q) and other Latin characters, as well as Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, and Greek. The grammar developed by Steffler is not currently applied in any teaching method or government initiative.

Currently, the language has two codification proposals. The first, from the SIL International, is led by professor and doctor Ursula Wiesemann and has an approach more focused on using the writing system used naturally by its native speakers in everyday actions, such as interpersonal interaction and the use of social networks. With a strong influence of the Latin alphabet used in Portuguese, it has the native name of &quot;Hunsrik&quot;, with the aim of distinguishing it as a unique Germanic language and not just as a dialect of the German language. This codification is applied in the teaching of municipal schools in Santa Maria do Herval, Estância Velha, and Nova Hartz, as well as in other municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul. The name Hunsrik can also be used officially to refer to the language in English and Portuguese, being officially called &quot;Hunsrik language&quot; by most federative entities that recognize it in Brazil. The spelling translated into Portuguese as &quot;Brazilian &quot;Hunsrückisch&quot;&quot; is also accepted by the project, however the preference is for the use of the former to generate a clearer differentiation of the language.

The second coding project, from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, is led by doctor and professor Cléo Vilson Altenhofen and has a more unionist approach to the German language, characterized by the preservation of the writing of the German Hunsrückisch dialect with few variations. This project recommends the spelling &quot;Hunsrückisch&quot; to refer to the dialect in its native form, with &quot;Hunsrickisch&quot; being an alternative as a way to emphasize the pronunciation of the word. At the same time, the project states that it refers to the same language denoted by Hunsrik in other projects and also accepts it as a spelling. The term &quot;Hunsrückisch&quot; is also used officially in statements by some federal entities. To differentiate the dialect used in Brazil from that used in Germany, Altenhofen called the Brazilian dialect &quot;Riograndenser Hunsrückisch&quot; (with reference to the state of Rio Grande do Sul). This nomenclature, however, is criticized by other scholars, since there are also considerable numbers of native speakers in other Brazilian states, as well as in other countries.

Currently, UNESCO officially uses the Hunsrik spelling to refer to the language in its native form, made official with that name after studies by &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, an official advisory institution of the international body and whose publications are led by SIL International. The Hunsrik spelling is also used by Glottolog in its bibliographic database of the least known languages in the world, catalog of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Other international bodies that use this native spelling in the recognition of Hunsrik as a language are the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and the International Organization for Standardization; the latter assigns the hrx code as ISO 639-3 for the Hunsrik language. In some municipalities in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, the language is also called &quot;Deitsch&quot; (Altenhofen) or &quot;Taytx&quot; (Wiesemann), in clear reference to its roots in standard German.

== Notable speakers ==
Recent Roman Catholic papal candidate Odilo Scherer of Cerro Largo (located in the northwest of Rio Grande do Sul) grew up with Hunsrik as many from his native region did, using it side-by-side with Portuguese, the national language.

Roman Catholic Cardinal Cláudio Hummes of Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul (in the &quot;Altkolonie&quot; region of the state), grew up speaking Portuguese alongside Hunsrik.

According to supermodel Gisele Bündchen, while her parents and siblings still speak Hunsrik, she has forgotten all of it herself.

During an interview in 2011, renowned Brazilian writer, translator, and international relations professor Aldyr Schlee talked in detail about having been an eyewitness to the repression of Hunsrik in his native state of Rio Grande do Sul during World War II.

Orthography between plain angle brackets follows Wiesemann&#x27;s orthography and between italic angle brackets follows Altenhofen et al.&#x27;s orthography.

The contrast between plosives is not of voice, but of articulatory force, a phenomenon observed in some other dialects of German.

==Sample==
The passages of Luke 23:1-5 in Hunsrik, according to Dr. Ursula Wiesemann&#x27;s orthography:

The same Bible section in Luxembourgish:

In Standard German:

And in English:

23 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, &quot;We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.&quot; 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, &quot;Art thou the King of the Jews?&quot; And he answered him and said, &quot;Thou sayest it.&quot; 4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, &quot;I find no fault in this man.&quot; 5 And they were the more fierce, saying, &quot;He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;Baffin&quot; was an trawler of the Royal Navy. Constructed in Canada for the Royal Navy, the trawler was one of eight loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. The vessel was mostly engaged in minesweeping duties out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Following the war, &quot;Baffin&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy. The vessel was then sold into mercantile service. The vessel was broken up in 1983.

==Design and description==
The Isles class were a series of anti-submarine trawlers constructed for the Royal Navy. A development of the earlier , 145 were constructed during the war. The Isles-class trawlers displaced standard and
 at deep load. They were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .

The trawlers were propelled by one shaft driven by one vertical triple expansion engine powered by steam provided by a one-cylinder boiler. This created giving the ships a maximum speed of . &quot;Baffin&quot;, being constructed in Canada, was armed with a single QF 12-pounder 12 cwt gun and three Oerlikon 20 mm cannons for anti-aircraft defence. They had a complement between 35 and 40 officers and ratings.

==Service history==
The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down by Collingwood Shipbuilding at Collingwood, Ontario on 14 October 1941. The ship was launched on 13 April 1942. The vessel was lent to the Royal Canadian Navy, but was never commissioned into it and was manned by a Royal Navy crew. The vessel was completed on 20 August 1942. Named for Baffin Island, as all the vessels loaned to Canada were named for Canadian islands, the ship saw service at Halifax performing anti-submarine duties.

Returned by the Royal Canadian Navy on 20 August 1945, the ship was sold for mercantile use on in October 1945. In 1947 the vessel was converted to a trawler under the same name, registered to Harbour Specialties Ltd out of London. In 1952 the vessel was sold to F.Osterwisch &amp; Co KG and rebuilt with a new diesel engine, becoming the cargo ship &quot;Niedermehnen&quot;. The ship was sold in 1965 Hans Petersen and renamed &quot;Kellenhusen&quot;. In 1969, the vessel was sold to Hans Thiessen and renamed &quot;Kairos&quot;. The vessel became &quot;Theoxenia&quot; after being sold to Grigorios Karlovits &amp; Fotini Papadopoulou in 1981. &quot;Theoxenia&quot; was purchased two more times, retaining her name. The ship was broken up in 1983, and eventually deleted from Lloyd&#x27;s Register in 1995.

<doc id="652767" wikidata="Q6481107" url="?curid=652767" title="Lambda Chi Alpha">
<text>Lambda Chi Alpha (), commonly referred to as Lambda Chi, is a collegiate fraternity in North America. With over 300,000 initiates as of 2024, it is the third-largest social fraternity in the world by number of initiates. It has almost 8,700 current undergraduate members affiliated with chapters and associate chapters at 166 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. Its members may be known variously as Lambda Chis, LXAs, LCAs, Lambdas, Chops, or Choppers at different campuses.

Lambda Chi Alpha was founded at Boston University in 1909. It is a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC), which it rejoined in November 2023 after withdrawing from the conference in 2015. Among the largest 15 social fraternities in the world, Lambda Chi Alpha is the youngest. Since 2014, after maintaining its headquarters at various locations in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, it has been headquartered in Carmel, Indiana, outside Indianapolis.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Lambda Chi Alpha was founded by Warren A. Cole, a law student at Boston University School of Law in Boston. There are two different accounts of the fraternity&#x27;s founding.

The official story told by Cole and Albert Cross is that on , Cole, Percival C. Morse, and Clyde K. Nichols reorganized the Cosmopolitan Law Club, a society of Boston University law students into the Loyal Collegiate Associates, which was renamed Lambda Chi Alpha in 1912. All were close friends and had been members of Alpha Mu Chi, a prep school fraternity. The Greek letter name is thought to have been used from the beginning but is not recorded in the &quot;Alpha Zeta&quot; minutes until April 27, 1910.

A second account of the founding, based on interviews with contemporaries, is that Cole and others did belong to a loose group known as the Tombs or Cosmopolitan Club but this was not related to Lambda Chi Alpha&#x27;s founding. Instead, according to the alternative account, Cole shared an apartment with James C. McDonald and Charles W. Proctor, who later joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Cole then established his own fraternity with Ralph S. Miles, Harold W. Bridge, and Percival C. Morse on . The group issued a charter for itself that was backdated to November 15.

Cole approached many local groups at colleges and universities throughout the Northeast seeking others willing to join his new fraternity. He corresponded with or visited 117 institutions by 1912, when a group at Massachusetts Agricultural College accepted a charter to become &quot;Gamma Zeta&quot;. The first General Assembly, establishing a structure for the national fraternity, was held in Boston on April 13, 1912.

The fraternity held its second general assembly in Boston on in which the fraternity adopted its secret motto, ritual insignia including its badge and coat of arms, and the basic organizational structure. Lambda Chi Alpha virtually replaced the fraternity Cole had established outside of its name. The 14th General Assembly, in 1931, recognized March 22 as Lambda Chi Alpha Day in recognition of these achievements. In 1942, the board of directors renamed it Founder&#x27;s Day. is also still recognized, so Lambda Chi Alpha celebrates two Founders Days annually.

In the years that followed, a divide opened between Cole and a group of young alumni led by Mason, Ernst J.C. Fischer of Lambda Chi&#x27;s Cornell University chapter in Ithaca, New York, and Samuel Dyer of the University of Maine chapter in Orono, Maine. Dyer was supported by Albert Cross at the University of Pennsylvania chapter in Philadelphia and Louis Robbins of the Brown University chapter in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1920, Cole was ousted and Fischer was elected national president. In 1927, Fischer became international president when &quot;Epsilon-Epsilon Zeta&quot; at the University of Toronto in Toronto was chartered.

===Theta Kappa Nu merger===

The Theta Kappa Nu fraternity was formed by eleven local fraternities on June 9, 1924, in Springfield, Missouri. With the help of the North American Interfraternity Conference in identifying local groups, and Theta Kappa Nu&#x27;s policy of granting charters quickly to organizations with good academic standards, the fraternity grew quickly and had approximately 2,500 initiates in 40 chapters by the end of 1926.

During the Great Depression, both Theta Kappa Nu and Lambda Chi Alpha saw membership decrease and chapters shut down. In 1939, the two fraternities agreed to merge. The merger ceremony was held at Howard College (now Samford University) chapter of Theta Kappa Nu in Birmingham, Alabama. The merger immediately increased the number of chapters from 77 to 105 (or 78 to 106) and the number of members from 20,000 to 27,000. At the time, this was the largest merger in fraternity history. All Theta Kappa Nu chapters became Lambda Chi Alpha chapters and were given chapter designations that began with either Theta, Kappa, or Nu. At schools where chapters of both fraternities previously existed, the two merged and retained Lambda Chi&#x27;s Zeta recognition.

=== Headquarters locations ===
Lambda Chi Alpha was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1909. For the first decade of its existence, the fraternity lacked a central office and records were divided between the homes of Grand High Alpha Warren A. Cole in Swansea, Massachusetts and Registrar Samuel Dyer in Attleboro, Massachusetts. In 1920, the fraternity moved its headquarters to Northeastern Pennsylvania, where it was located in Kingston and Wilkes Barre. Later that year, it relocated to Indianapolis, where many other fraternity and sorority national headquarters are located. Since 2021, its headquarters has been based in Carmel, Indiana, outside Indianapolis. Its former headquarters include:

* 1909: Swansea, Massachusetts and Attleboro, Massachusetts
* 1920: 261 Pierce Street, Kingston, Pennsylvania, 18704
* 1920: 160 South Main Street, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania 18701

===North American Interfraternity Conference===

The fraternity first joined the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) in 1913. In October 2015, it resigned from the association, citing in-fighting and dysfunctional governance. The fraternity&#x27;s exit coincided with NIC lobbying for the Safe Campus Act, which was opposed by both the fraternity and sexual assault advocacy groups. Lambda Chi Alpha re-joined the NIC in November 2023.

== Symbols ==
The colors of Lambda Chi Alpha are royal purple, kelly green, and old gold. Its symbols are the cross and crescent. Its flower is the white rose and its mascot is the lion rampant. Its mottos are &#x27; or &quot;Crescent through the Cross&quot;, &#x27; or &quot;Naught Without Labor&quot;, and &quot;&quot; or &quot;Every Man a Man.&quot;

== Membership ==
Beginning in August 1969, the concept of fraternity education replaced pledge education at Lambda Chi Alpha. The fraternity education program was designed to integrate all new members into the chapter equally.

In 1972, Lambda Chi Alpha officially abolished the pledge process and replaced it with associate membership. Associate members in Lambda Chi Alpha to this day have all of the same rights as initiated brothers, can hold officer positions, wear the letters, and can vote on all issues except for those involving Lambda Chi&#x27;s initiation ritual. Status as an associate member permits new members to enter the fraternity with respect, and helps to combat the issues that arise from the possible abuse of pledges. Lambda Chi Alpha was the first fraternal organization to abolish pledging. 

== Philanthropy ==

From 1993 to 2012, Lambda Chi Alpha&#x27;s philanthropy was the North American Food Drive (NAFD). As of 2010, NAFD had collected around 33 million pounds of food for food banks. In 2012, NAFD was discontinued under that name and rolled into an ongoing partnership with Feeding America.

In 2017, Lambda Chi Alpha announced a trial partnership with the St. Baldrick&#x27;s Foundation, a Monrovia, California-based organization that funds childhood cancer research. Chapters were encouraged to host or participate in head-shaving events to raise money for the foundation.

In 2019, Lambda Chi Alpha announced a partnership with The Jed Foundation, a Boston-based non-profit organization that seeks to protect emotional health and prevent suicide for teens and young adults. Together, they are launching Lambda Chi Alpha Lifeline, an online mental health resource center tailored from the foundation&#x27;s ULifeline website, which provides college students with information about emotional health issues and specific resources available to them on their respective campuses. It also offers a confidential mental health self-screening tool.

In 2020, Lambda Chi Alpha announced its partnership with Movember, an Australia-based non-profit foundation that raises awareness of men&#x27;s health issues such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and men&#x27;s suicide. Movember has recently become a primary philanthropic focus for Lambda Chi Alpha and the fraternity&#x27;s national administrative office.

In 2023, Lambda Chi Alpha announced its partnership with American Red Cross, a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness education in the United States. Lambda Chi Alpha is the first and only fraternity with a partnership with The American Red Cross.

== Chapters ==
As of 2024, Lambda Chi Alpha reported 185 active chapters and associate chapters, representing universities in most U.S. states and three Canadian provinces.

=== Chapter naming ===
Lambda Chi Alpha is atypical in its naming scheme. Unlike most fraternities, the order in which chapters are named is not strictly based on the Greek alphabet. Instead, Lambda Chi Alpha chapters are known as Zetas. As such, for instance, the Alpha-Beta chapter is designated Alpha-Beta Zeta. In addition, since the fraternity&#x27;s founding, Cole assigned Greek letters to petitioning groups that had not yet been chartered. Not all of these groups were chartered, however. As a result, the first 22 chapters were designated Α, Γ, Ε, Ζ, Ι, Λ, Β, Σ, Φ, Δ, Π, Ο, Μ, Τ, Η, Θ, Υ, Ξ, Χ, Ω, Κ, Ν, Ρ, Ψ. After the 24th chapter, the sequence was continued with a prefix following the same sequence (Α-Α, Α-Γ, Α-Ε, ... Γ-Α, Γ-Γ, Γ-Ε, ... Ε-A, etc.)

When Theta Kappa Nu merged with Lambda Chi Alpha in 1939, the former Theta Kappa Nu chapters were each given chapter designations prefixed with Θ, Κ, or Ν. The second letter of their chapter name was assigned in the order mentioned above and applied to the chapters in order of their precedence in Theta Kappa Nu. On campuses with chapters of both Lambda Chi Alpha and Theta Kappa Nu, the chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha kept its original designation.

A singular exception was the chapter at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, &quot;Β-Κ Zeta&quot;, which was named in recognition of its existence as a chapter of the Beta Kappa, a national fraternity whose other existing chapters merged with Theta Chi in 1942.

== Alumni ==

Lambda Chi Alpha has over 300,000 members. 

In 1945, Harry S. Truman, the 33rd president of the United States, was made an honorary initiate of the Lambda Chi Alpha chapter at the University of Missouri.

==In popular culture==

Lambda Chi Alpha is referenced in the 2005 Kenny Chesney song &quot;Keg in the Closet&quot;, which includes the lyrics: &quot;This ol&#x27; guitar taught me how to score, right there on that Lambda Chi porch, Mary Ann taught me a little more, about wanting what you can&#x27;t have.&quot; Chesney is a Lambda Chi brother from the Iota-Omicron chapter at East Tennessee State University.

In 2023, the University of New Orleans chapter was featured in Season Seven, Episode 1 of the Netflix series, &quot;Queer Eye&quot;.

=== Smoot ===

In October 1958, a Lambda Chi pledge at MIT, Oliver R. Smoot, gained global recognition when his MIT fraternity brothers had him lay down repeatedly on Harvard Bridge between Boston and Cambridge while they measured the bridge using his height, which turned out to be 5 feet 7 inches. Smoot&#x27;s height was defined as one &quot;smoot&quot;, and Harvard Bridge was officially measured as smoots long. The measurement is commemorated with a plaque on Harvard Bridge describing the incident. In 2009, in remembrance and celebration of the legacy of Oliver Smoot, the Pennsylvania Western University Edinboro chapter contributed to funding the construction of a pickleball facility in collaboration with the university. The addition comprised a total square footage of 46,735.8 smoots (261,720,384.48 sq ft).

In 2011, the word &quot;smoot&quot; and its definition were added to the fifth edition of the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;.

== Controversies and allegations of misconduct ==
=== 20th century ===
In October 1958, the fraternity expelled its Hamilton College chapter in Clinton, New York, for insisting on a non-discrimination policy for admitting members. The national fraternity insisted that its members be Christians who were either White or Native American. The expelled chapter reorganized as an independent society called Gryphon, which continued to operate for more than two decades.

In May 1988, James Callahan, an associate at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, died of an alcohol overdose from a Lambda Chi Alpha drinking hazing ritual. Fifteen members of the chapter were indicted for his death.

===21st century===
In November 2007, Remy Okonkwo, a member at Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, was found hanging in the Lambda Chi house on campus. The coroner ruled his death a suicide but his family alleged foul play was involved.

In January 2011, the chapter at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida was suspended after a sorority member whose identical twin sister was dating a Lambda Chi brother shot and killed her inside the house.

In May 2014, following a yearlong investigation, seven members at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign were arrested and charged with using and distributing illegal drugs. Police found MDMA pills, 40 grams of MDMA powder, cocaine residue, Adderall pills, suspected LSD, &quot;cannabis&quot;, a large tank of nitrous oxide, and drug paraphernalia in the fraternity house. As a place to purchase drugs, the fraternity had reportedly gained the nickname &quot;the candy shop&quot;, according to &quot;The News-Gazette&quot;.

In March 2016, the chapter at Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas was placed on a five-year suspension for hazing and code of conduct violations. In 2009, the fraternity was previously suspended for similar infractions, which led to the expulsion of 35 out of its 92 members.

In May 2016, the fraternity&#x27;s national office suspended the chapter at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon after a photo of a Lambda Chi Alpha cooler decorated with the phrase, &quot;Do you wanna do some blow man?&quot; went viral on the Internet. The cooler was discovered along with a half-mile wide swath of trash left behind at Shasta Lake in Northern California, where an estimated 1,000 students had docked houseboats over the weekend.

In August 2016, Colson Machlitt, a football player at Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, died after allegedly jumping down a flight of stairs at the fraternity. Alcohol was suspected to be involved in his death.

In January 2017, the Indiana University-Bloomington chapter in Bloomington, Indiana, was placed under a two-year suspension after an associate member reported hazing activities occurring in the chapter house to the university, which allegedly included brutal physical exercise, liquor hazing, and the act of capping were mentioned in the report. In response, the fraternity&#x27;s national office removed over 100 members, who were able to fully recolonize in fall 2021.

In April 2018, the chapter at Cal Poly SLO in San Luis Obispo, California was placed on interim suspension after social media images surfaced depicting members dressed up as gang members with one wearing blackface during the school&#x27;s multicultural celebration weekend.

In August 2018, the chapter at Butler University in Indianapolis was suspended by the school, which did not cite a specific reason for the suspension. The &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; reported that alcohol violations played a part. The university said it would not consider reinstating the chapter until 2021. Following the suspension, a woman filed a civil rights complaint against the university, saying that it grossly mishandled her allegation that she was raped by a member of the fraternity during a fraternity party. The fraternity member had previously been accused of sexual misconduct by another student.

In September 2020, the University of Georgia chapter in Athens, Georgia, was suspended after racist and other insensitive text messages between members were exposed by a fellow student on Twitter.

In January 2024, the West Virginia University chapter in Morgantown, West Virginia was placed on an interim suspension following allegations of permitting and facilitating underage alcohol consumption.

<doc id="652787" wikidata="Q4354711" url="?curid=652787" title="Human rights in Turkmenistan">
<text>Turkmenistan&#x27;s human rights record has been heavily criticized by various countries and scholars worldwide. Standards in education and health declined markedly during the rule of President Saparmurat Niyazov.

Since December 2006, under the Government of President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, no significant improvements regarding human rights and civil liberty have been observed by international human rights organizations.

==Discrimination against ethnic minorities==

The Turkmen government&#x27;s decision to cancel a dual-citizenship agreement with Russia in 2003 prompted thousands of ethnic Russians to leave Turkmenistan as they lost their property. Many of those fleeing &quot;in panic&quot; reportedly feared being trapped in a state which has been widely criticised for human rights abuses and has imposed severe restrictions on foreign travel for its citizens. Those without Russian passports may be forced to become Turkmens, and fear that they may never be able to return to Russia.

For these who remained, estimated at 100,000, all Soviet-time diplomas, certificates and other official documents that were issued outside the Turkmen SSR were nullified, drastically limiting the people&#x27;s access to work. At the same time, universities have been encouraged to reject applicants with non-Turkmen surnames, especially ethnic Russians. Russian television is difficult to receive in Turkmenistan. The Russian-language radio station Mayak was taken off the air. and the Russian newspapers were banned earlier.

It is forbidden to teach the customs and language of the Baloch, an ethnic minority. The same happened to Uzbeks, whose language is no longer taught in schools.

==Notable bans==
Former Turkmenbashi Saparmurat Niyazov banned the playing of video games, listening to car radios, performing opera and ballet, smoking in public, long hair on men, and even growing facial hair. It has been speculated that the latter ban was enacted to enforce conformity of appearance. Niyazov ordered the closure of all libraries outside the capital of Ashgabat. News anchors, both men and women, were prevented from wearing any sort of make-up after Niyazov discovered he was unable to tell the difference between them when the presenters wore it.

In 2008, the bans of circuses and operas were reversed, but the former leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow banned the importation of cars and trucks produced before 2000.

As of 2017, Turkmenistan has signed the Ottawa Treaty on land mines, setting it apart from many of its neighbors (excluding Afghanistan).

==Freedom of religion==

Freedom of religion is guaranteed by article 11 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan. However, like other human rights, in practice it does not exist. Former President Saparmurat Niyazov&#x27;s book of spiritual writings, the &quot;Ruhnama&quot;, is imposed on all religious communities. According to Forum 18, despite international pressure, the authorities severely repress all religious groups, and the legal framework is so constrictive that many prefer to exist underground rather than have to pass through all of the official hurdles. Protestant Christian adherents are affected, in addition to groups such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Baháʼí, and Hare Krishna. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been imprisoned and suffered beatings due to being conscientious objectors. For example, a 33-year-old member of the denomination was sentenced to a 4-year prison term after being found carrying religious literature at a train station in Dashoguz. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has indicated that Jehovah&#x27;s Witness in Turkmenistan have been prosecuted and imprisoned for refusing to perform compulsory military service, despite Turkmenistan&#x27;s Constitution guaranteeing the right to &quot;practice any religion alone or in association with others&quot; and the right to &quot;freedom of conviction and the free expression of those convictions&quot;. The UN committee noted, &quot;The State party should take all necessary measures to review its legislation with a view to providing for alternative military service. The State party should also ensure that the law clearly stipulates that individuals have the right to conscientious objection to military service. Furthermore, the State party should halt all prosecutions of individuals who refuse to perform military service on grounds of conscience and release those individuals who are currently serving prison sentences.&quot;

A July 2003 issue of state-owned newspaper &quot;Adalat&quot;, published by the Ministry of Justice, printed a vitriolic attack against members of some religious groups, describing the groups as foreign and implying they were dangerous. There, the government continues to restrict the freedom of parents of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses to raise their children in accordance with their religious beliefs. Also, copies of Christian literature were confiscated by the government, including the Bible; the government claiming that it was not authentic Christian religious literature. In 2003, some Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were denied exit visas. Other Witnesses who were able to obtain exit visas were stopped after crossing a border and forced to return. Others were stopped and prevented from boarding a flight to another country because their names were included on a &quot;black list&quot; of citizens prohibited from leaving the country.

The U.S. Department of State&#x27;s &quot;2005 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom&quot; (released November 8, 2005) indicates persistent restrictions on religious freedoms in Turkmenistan, while categorizing it among countries that had made &quot;significant improvements in the promotion of religious freedom.&quot; U.S. Representative Chris Smith stated, however, &quot;The reforms that were instituted by the Niyazov regime over the past year did not go far enough, and even the report itself states that serious violations of religious freedom continue.&quot; U.S. Senator Sam Brownback noted, &quot;Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have clearly received more credit than the facts would warrant.&quot; The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Asma Jahangir, appealed to the government of Turkmenistan in June 2003 and again in 2005 for an invitation to visit the country; an invitation was issued in 2008 and a one-week visit was completed in September 2008.

In 2023, the country was scored zero out of 4 for religious freedom; it was noted that restrictions have tightened since 2016. In the same year it was ranked the 26th worst place in the world to be a Christian.

==Freedom of expression==
All mass media in Turkmenistan is controlled by the State. In July 2010, President Berdimuhamedow announced plans to allow private newspapers in the country. Once launched, they were expected to focus on successful business stories.

According to Reporters Without Borders&#x27; 2006 World Press Freedom Index, Turkmenistan had the third-worst press freedom conditions in the world, behind North Korea and Myanmar. It is considered to be one of the ten most censored countries. Each broadcast under Niyazov began with a pledge that the broadcaster&#x27;s tongue would shrivel if he slandered the country, flag, or president. While he was president, Niyazov controlled all Turkmen media outlets, and personally appointed journalists. Controversy surrounds the death of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Ogulsapar Myradowa, who was apparently tortured to death in September 2006 while in state detention.

It has been reported that journalists have been harassed by the government; some have been kept in prison and prosecuted with false accusations and unfair trials. Journalists frequently receive death threats. Activist Sazak Durdymuradov was detained in 2005 for collaborating with a French TV channel for a report on Turkmenistan. He was sentenced to eight years in jail under the accusation of &quot;illegal acquisition, possession or sale of ammunition or firearms&quot;. Amnesty International considers the accusations to be forged.

In 2006, Turkmen Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights activists Annakurban Amanklychev and Sapardurdy Khadzhiev were arrested by Turkmen security forces on espionage charges, later changed to illegal firearm charges. Amnesty International considers them prisoners of conscience and named them a 2011 &quot;priority case.&quot; Front Line, Reporters Without Borders, and Human Rights Watch have all described the charges as fabricated. On 11 December 2010, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also called for their immediate release, stating that their detention was a violation of international law.

The freelance journalists collaborating with international media are being closely watched by the state&#x27;s security departments. Correspondents for Radio Free Europe are under constant harassment and risk their life and liberty. On April 18, 2008, freelance journalist Sona Chuli Kuli was interrogated for several days under physiological pressure and forced to sign a statement agreeing not to collaborate with the international media.

===Internet===
Individual access to the Internet was first authorized in 2008, and access has since increased.

Turkmenistan ranks among the most repressive and closed societies in the world. The Internet is heavily regulated and available only to a small fraction of the population. Censorship is ubiquitous and extensive. An investigation published in 2023 reveals the country blocks at least 122,000 domain names. Surveillance is significant, and the few citizens who benefit from access to the Internet are closely monitored by state agencies. Self-censorship is common.

Websites run by human rights organizations and news agencies are blocked. Moreover, ordinary citizens have no access to the World Wide Web, and instead are limited to the use of the Turkmenet, an online community in Turkmen language, but effectively a censored version of the Internet. Social networks such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are not accessible through the Turkmenet. Attempts to get around this censorship can lead to grave consequences. However, only Russian social networks Odnoklassniki and Mail Agent Chatting system are available. In addition to this, there is a newly founded (27 March 2012) local Turkmen social network, E-Dostluk, which is currently accessible.

Internet censorship in Turkmenistan was classified as pervasive in the political area and as selective in the social, conflict/security and internet tools areas by the OpenNet Initiative in December 2010. Turkmenistan was listed as an internet enemy by Reporters Without Borders in 2011.

==Political freedom==

Any opposition to the government is considered treason and punishable by life imprisonment. Turkmenistan has many political prisoners, the most well-known of whom are Batyr Berdiýew, Ýazgeldi Gündogdyýew, and Boris Şyhmyradow. They are not granted any access by the International Red Cross, OSCE, or any medical institutions. There have been rumours of their deaths, but these cannot be confirmed, and the whereabouts of most are unknown.

In 2009, Muhammertguly Aýmyradow was freed after he completed his sentence.

Gulgeldy Annaniyazov, an opposition leader to Niyazov&#x27;s government, was arrested in 1995 and released in 1999 after a presidential amnesty decree. He moved to Norway to live with refugee status. Back in Turkmenistan, he was arrested in June 2008 and sentenced to 11 years in jail following a closed-door trial; the charges against him are unknown. Similarly, Ovezgeldy Ataev, former Speaker of Parliament, and Akmurad Redzhepov, former head of the State Security Council, had closed-door trials and remain in prison. Amnesty International suspects that the reason for the imprisonments lies in the fact that both were potential political rivals of the current President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow.

Andrey Zatoka, environmentalist and activist, citizen of Turkmenistan and Russia, was arrested on false charges for 46 days from December 2006 to January 2007. Due to international pressure, Andrey was released and the sentence was canceled. In June 2008, Andrey wrote a statement reporting that his and his friends&#x27; liberty could be in danger. He was being monitored and followed by the Turkmen authorities. On October 20, 2009, Andrey was arrested for the second time and sentenced to 5 years in prison for assault. In November 2009, after international pressure from environmental and human rights organisations and Russian authorities, Zatoka was released upon payment of a fine, relinquishing his Turkmen citizenship and immediate emigration from Turkmenistan.

==Police brutality==
Arbitrary arrests and mistreatment of detained persons are common in Turkmenistan, as is torture to obtain confessions. In 2004, border guards shot and killed six people who were allegedly illegally crossing the border from Iran. There are reports of prisoners dying after having food and medical care withheld. Ogulsapar Myradowa, a journalist and human rights activist, died violently in prison in September 2006.

In 2018&#x27;s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices by the US State Department, Turkmenistan was condemned for &quot;alleged torture&quot;, arbitrary arrests and detentions, involuntary confinement, imprisonment of political prisoners, severe corruption, lack of free and fair elections, and restrictions on freedom of religion, assembly, and movement.

==Historical situation==
The following chart shows Turkmenistan&#x27;s ratings since 1991 in the Freedom in the World reports, published annually by Freedom House. A rating of 1 is &quot;free&quot;; 7, &quot;not free&quot;.

<text>NetIQ is a security software company. In 2023 it was acquired by OpenText.

NetIQ was previously based in San Jose, California, with products that provide identity and access management, security and data center management. Its flagship offerings are NetIQ AppManager, NetIQ Identity Manager and NetIQ Access Manager. 

OpenText has owned NetIQ since 2023 after its acquisition of Micro Focus, which acquired The Attachmate Group, which acquired NetIQ in 2006, six years after the latter acquired Mission Critical Software.

==History==
NetIQ was founded by Ching-fa Hwang, Her-daw Che, Hon Wong, Ken Prayoon Cheng and Tom Kemp in September 1995; AppManager was introduced in 1996. Their February 2000 merger with Mission Critical Software widened the company&#x27;s focus to include systems management as well as performance.

In 2001, NetIQ acquired Webtrends, whose software &quot;monitors corporate Internet traffic.&quot; — which they sold in 2005.

In 2006, NetIQ was acquired by AttachmateWRQ, After that company acquired Novell in 2011, it changed its name to The Attachmate Group. NetIQ added identity and security products as well as data center and virtualization to their offerings. It was the Attachmate acquisition that led to the alignment of NetIQ products into three categories: 
* identity and access management, 
* security management and 
* data center management.

In 2014, The Attachmate Group was merged into Micro Focus International. NetIQ also announced the use of an Identity Manager number 4.5.

<text>North Harrow is a suburban area of North West London, situated north-west of central Harrow within the London Borough of Harrow. Its residential roads have expanded from North Harrow tube station, a station on the Metropolitan line of the London Underground which is one stop away from Harrow-on-the-Hill station in Harrow town centre. Before North Harrow tube station was opened and the suburb developed, the area was known as Hooking Green.

North Harrow&#x27;s statistics exceed the London average in terms of safety, affluence and quality of education of its schools. In the area, there is predominantly low-rise, low-density, high floor space housing; there is substantial parkland in the neighbourhood such as on all sides of Headstone Manor, Yeading Brook Open Space and miniature railway and sports ground in adjoining pasture grasslands of Pinner Park, contrasted with diverse amenities, particularly in the areas of the tube station, Imperial Drive and along Pinner Road, including a post office, Tesco Express, a selection of restaurants, take-aways and cafés and independent specialist shops. The area is also served by North Harrow Library.

North Harrow is part of Harrow West along with West Harrow and central Harrow, a parliamentary constituency represented by Labour Party (UK) MP Gareth Thomas.

About 800m north of the tube line is a 14th-century moated manor house, Headstone Manor, which serves to support the area&#x27;s excellence in sport with public grounds on all sides as well as Harrow Museum and Heritage Centre, which is based in Headstone Manor Recreation Ground. The Heritage Centre chronicles Harrow&#x27;s historical past and runs many special events and exhibitions throughout the year.

== Sport at Headstone Manor ==

The Headstone Manor Recreation Ground is used for training for the Headstone Manor Youth football club for age groups ranging from Under 8&#x27;s to the Senior team. The most successful Headstone Manor team to date was managed by Nigel &#x27;Trout Pout&#x27; Trout, between 2000 and 2005. The team won the Middlesex Cup an unprecedented three years in a row (2001/02, 2002/03 and 2003/04) and became the first team to appear in four consecutive finals, losing the 2000/01 final. The team also won the Harrow Youth League Cup three times (2000/01, 2001/02 and 2003/04) and the Harrow Youth League Premier Division twice (2000/01 and 2001/02) therefore achieving the &#x27;treble&#x27; in their 2001/02 season.

==Amenities==
 There are several schools in the area and churches. Among the churches is the 1930s-built Anglican church south of the railway line to serve the area, which survived quite sporadic destruction in World War II, dedicated to St Alban, whose cathedral is not far away to the north in St Albans.

<doc id="652798" wikidata="Q1439196" url="?curid=652798" title="Forum 18">
<text>Forum 18 is a Norwegian human rights organization that promotes religious freedom. The organization&#x27;s name is based on Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Forum 18 summarizes the article as:

*The right to believe, to worship and witness
*The right to change one&#x27;s belief or religion
*The right to join together and express one&#x27;s belief

The &quot;Forum 18 News Service&quot;, established by Forum 18 on March 13, 2003, is a web and e-mail initiative to report on threats and actions against the religious freedom of all people, whatever their religious affiliation, in an objective, truthful and timely manner. The first three reporters to lead this project were Felix Corley, Geraldine Fagan, and Igor Rotar. They had previously done similar reporting for the UK-based Keston News Service and continued this work at Forum 18 after Keston Institute closed its news service due to financial difficulties and staff changes. 

The news service mainly concentrates on the states of the former Soviet Union, including Belarus, Georgia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe, but has also published reports on Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, Burma, China (including Xinjiang), Laos, Mongolia, North Korea, and Vietnam.

The news service is published in two editions: a weekly news summary each Friday; and an almost daily edition published on weekdays. There is a searchable archive of reports, including religious freedom surveys of countries and regions, and personal commentaries on religious freedom issues.

In August 2005 one of the organisation&#x27;s reporters was detained and deported by the authorities at Tashkent airport in Uzbekistan, but it carries on covering that country.

The reports on religious freedom from Forum 18 News Service are widely used by international organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), as well as numerous news sites with different religious affiliation (i.e. Muslim, Christian, Bahá&#x27;í, and Buddhist).

<text>Giovanni Benelli (12 May 1921 – 26 October 1982) was an Italian Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Florence from 1977 until his death. He previously served as Deputy Secretary of State for the Holy See from 1967 until he was appointed to Florence and made a cardinal the same year.

==Biography==

===Early life and ordination===
Giovanni Benelli was born 12 May 1921 in Poggiole di Vernio, Tuscany, to Luigi and Maria (née Simoni) Benelli. Baptised the day after his birth, on 13 May, he was the youngest of his parents&#x27; five surviving children, and his uncle Guido was a revered Franciscan friar. Benelli entered the Seminary of Pistoia in 1931, and then attended the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome. He received the clerical tonsure on 23 December 1939, and was eventually ordained a priest on 31 October 1943 by Bishop Giuseppe Debernardi. At age 22, he had not yet reached the canonical age of 24 for priestly ordination, and therefore was given a special dispensation. Benelli finished his studies at the Gregorian in 1947, and also undertook pastoral work in Rome until 1950.

His abilities were noticed by the Church, becoming private secretary in 1946 to Deputy Secretary of State Giovanni Battista Montini. Benelli joined the diplomatic service in 1948, and was raised to the rank of Monsignor on 16 July 1950. He served as the Secretary of nunciatures to Ireland (1950–1953) and to France (1953–1960). Benelli was then appointed to the following posts: auditor of nunciature to Brazil (1960–1962), counsellor of nunciature to Spain (1962–1965), and permanent observer of Holy See to UNESCO in Paris (1965–1966).

===Archbishop===
On 11 June 1966, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Tusuro and Apostolic Nuncio to Senegal, as well as apostolic delegate to Western Africa. Benelli received his episcopal consecration on the following 11 September from Cardinal Secretary of State Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Archbishop Pietro Sigismondi and Bishop Mario Longo Dorni serving as co-consecrators. These assignments gave him a deep interest in the battle against illiteracy and the Church&#x27;s work for peace and economic development.

Within a year, on 29 June 1967, he entered the Roman Curia as Substitute, or Deputy, of the Secretariat of State. As Cicognani was too old to fulfil most of his duties, they fell to Benelli. He worked closely with his former master, now Pope Paul VI, and remained in this post for ten years.

Some referred to him as &quot;the Berlin Wall&quot; and the &quot;Vatican Kissinger&quot; in the Vatican for his aggressive and almost authoritarian tenure as Substitute of the Secretariat of State, including having the more senior Curialists channel business through him.

Benelli was promoted to Archbishop of Florence on 3 June 1977, and was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca by Paul VI in the consistory of 27 June 1977.

===Papabile===
Upon the deaths of Popes Paul VI and John Paul I, Benelli was considered the leading moderate candidate to succeed them, because of his close ties with Paul and his Italian heritage. He was one of the cardinal electors in the conclaves of August and October 1978. During the August conclave, Benelli supported Albino Luciani, the eventual winner, who became Pope John Paul I. In the October conclave in 1978, he was one of two leading Italian candidates in a tie with Giuseppe Siri to succeed John Paul I, but was defeated with fellow Italian candidate Siri on 16 October by Karol Wojtyła, who became Pope John Paul II.

===Later life and death===
Benelli continued in his capacity of Cardinal and Archbishop of Florence until 26 October 1982 when he died of a sudden heart attack in Florence, at age 61. His funeral Mass was celebrated by Cicognani&#x27;s successor, Agostino Casaroli, and his remains were buried in Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral.

<doc id="652810" wikidata="Q2622493" url="?curid=652810" title="Rentokil Initial">
<text>Rentokil Initial is a British business services group based in Crawley, England. It was founded in 1925 as a pest-control business. It subsequently expanded and diversified, in part through growth under the leadership of Sir Clive Thompson in the 1980s and 1990s, and in part through the acquisition of BET plc in 1996, into a business delivering a wide range of facilities management services. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==
The company was founded in 1925 by Harold Maxwell-Lefroy, professor of entomology at Imperial College, London, who had been investigating ways to kill death watch beetles that had infested Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster. Lefroy and his assistant produced an anti-woodworm fluid called &quot;Ento-Kill Fluids&quot; (&quot;ento&quot; coming from the Greek word for insect, ἔντομον entomon). That year he tried to register the name &quot;Entokill&quot;, but owing to existing trademarks, he chose &quot;Rentokil&quot; instead, and this became the name of his company, Rentokil Ltd. Lefroy was later killed in a laboratory accident when an experiment produced poisonous fumes.

===British Ratin===
British Ratin was established in 1927 as a pest control company by its Danish owner Sophus Berendsen A/S; the company used a bacillus developed by a Danish scientist George Neumann to control rats and mice. Demand for pest control services began extending beyond rodent control to insect control. British Ratin made its first acquisition, Chelsea Insecticides Ltd, in 1940. In 1957 British Ratin acquired Rentokil, and the combined businesses continued to use the Rentokil name, becoming Rentokil Laboratories Ltd. in 1960.

===Rentokil Group plc===
Rentokil Group plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969. Sophus Berendsen A/S retained a 50% holding in the group until the late 1990s. For many years Rentokil Initial achieved growth of about 20% each year under the leadership of then CEO, Sir Clive Thompson. During this period Rentokil Initial was voted &quot;Britain&#x27;s most admired&quot; company.

===Rentokil Initial plc===
In 1996, following the hostile takeover of its much larger competitor BET plc, the company became Rentokil Initial. The acquisition included the &quot;Initial&quot; laundry and washroom services business (founded in 1903), with Rentokil Initial now providing various services from laundry to washroom hygiene products. The &quot;Initial&quot; name derived from the fact that every towel was marked with the customer&#x27;s initials, ensuring that customers only received their own towels.

===Recent history===
Thompson relinquished the CEO role to James Wilde, with Thompson taking up the chairman&#x27;s role, in January 2003. Thompson and Wilde both left the company in 2004, when the leadership was transferred to Brian McGowan as Chairman (appointed in 2004) and Doug Flynn as CEO (appointed in 2005). They made a number of structural changes to the company, including the closure of the main offices at Felcourt, near East Grinstead, relocating them to Belgrave House, Victoria, Central London and City Place, Gatwick. They also presided over a succession of profit warnings, mainly as a result of the problematic integration of the 2006 acquisition of Target Express into the existing City Link business.

The Rentokil Tropical Plants business, which had expanded to be an international brand through the acquisition of numerous smaller plant rental companies around the world, was rebranded as Ambius.

In 2006, the Company decided to close its UK Initial laundry business, mainly due to the ageing property and plant that the business operated (which had been part of the BET acquisition) and the high cost of modernisation. That year, the company also bought Ademco Security Group and planned to expand across Asia. They sold the company in 2010.

The company temporarily left the FTSE 100 index in 2007.

Rentokil strengthened its foothold in the US residential pest control market in 2006, when it acquired the Reading, Pennsylvania-based J.C. Ehrlich Co, Inc., the fourth-largest and largest privately held pest control company in the US. In the following year Rentokil sold the Initial Fire, Electronic Security and staffed guarding businesses, previously known as Shorrock, to United Technologies Corporation. However, in 2010, Rentokil Initial acquired Knightsbridge Guarding Ltd and Perception LLP to re-enter the staffed security/reception staffing business, to complement the existing cleaning, washroom, Ambius and pest control businesses.

In March 2008 the company came under the leadership of Chairman John McAdam and CEO Alan Brown, who had respectively served as CEO and CFO at ICI: the pair were previously responsible for the breakup and sale of ICI to Akzo Nobel.

In February 2011, the company acquired the Fumigation &amp; Pest Control, Water Treatment &amp; Hygiene and Fire Safety &amp; Prevention businesses of Santia, formerly Connaught plc, for £5.6m.

In 2012, Rentokil acquired Western Exterminator Company for US$99.6 million, extending its services to the west coast of the US, making Rentokil the third largest pest control company in the USA.

The City Link division had continued to make losses, and although these had reduced following major management/structural changes, the company was disposed of in April 2013 to Better Capital plc for £1.

On 1 August 2013, the company announced that CEO Alan Brown would be stepping down and would be replaced by Andy Ransom on 1 October. Ransom had previously been MD of the company&#x27;s West region.

On 28 February 2014, the company sold its facilities management business for £250m to Interserve.

On 16 December 2016, the company announced a future joint venture with CWS-boco International GmbH.

In March 2017, the company announced a joint venture with PCI of India to create the largest pest control company in India.

On 21 April 2017, Rentokil was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise - International Trade 2017. This was followed by The Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise for Innovation in 2018, recognising the company&#x27;s leadership position in digital innovation, in particular its RADAR and PestConnect systems. In 2020, a further Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise for Innovation for Lumnia, the world&#x27;s first commercial range of insect light traps that use LED lighting rather than traditional fluorescent tubes, reducing energy usage by up to 70%.

In 2018, Rentokil Initial plc announced a new partnership with Cool Earth to support its work in Papua New Guinea, protecting around 1,000 acres of rainforest and so preventing the release of at least 228,000 tonnes of emissions, equivalent to the company&#x27;s entire carbon footprint.

In 2019, the company announced a new initiative to use unclaimed shareholder dividends and unclaimed shares to fund charitable causes. A new fund, named Rentokil Initial Cares, was established. In the same year, it was awarded Britain&#x27;s Most Admired Company for Diversity &amp; Inclusion and topped the league table of the UK&#x27;s Best Workplaces in the private sector, according to data released by the world&#x27;s biggest job site, Indeed.

In December 2021, Rentokil announced that it would acquire Terminix for $6.7 billion: the transaction was completed on 12 October 2022. However, integration of the business was delayed. The process was originally projected to be completed by 2025, but as of March 2024, Terminix is not expected to be fully integrated until 2026.

In April 2022, Rentokil North America acquired JP Pest Services which operates throughout New England.

The company posted growth in 2023, with revenue up 44.7% to £5.37bn and pre-tax profits up 66.9% to £493m. Direction pest control was up 4.5 per cent, and hygiene and wellbeing by 4.8 per cent. But North America recorded lower growth rates.

<text>Twelfth Night (also known as Epiphany Eve depending upon the tradition) is a Christian festival on the last night of the Twelve Days of Christmas, marking the coming of the Epiphany. Different traditions mark the date of Twelfth Night as either or , depending on whether the counting begins on Christmas Day or . January 6 is celebrated as the feast of Epiphany, which begins the Epiphanytide season.

A superstition in some English-speaking countries suggests it is unlucky to leave Christmas decorations hanging after Twelfth Night, a tradition also variously attached to Candlemas (which marks the end of Epiphanytide on 2 February), as well as Good Friday, Shrove Tuesday, and Septuagesima. Other popular customs include eating king cake, singing Christmas carols, chalking the door, having one&#x27;s house blessed, merrymaking, and attending church services.

==Date==
In many Western ecclesiastical traditions such as the Lutheran and Anglican denominations of Christianity, Christmas Day is considered the &quot;First Day of Christmas&quot; and the Twelve Days are , inclusive, making Twelfth Night on , which is Epiphany Eve. In some customs, the Twelve Days of Christmas are counted from sundown on the evening of until the morning of , meaning that the Twelfth Night falls on the evening of and the Twelfth Day falls on . However, in some church traditions only full days are counted, so that is counted as the Eleventh Day, as the Twelfth Day, and the evening of is counted as the Twelfth Night. In these traditions, Twelfth Night is the same as Epiphany. However, some consider Twelfth Night to be the &quot;eve&quot; of the Twelfth Day (in the same way that Christmas Eve comes before Christmas), and thus consider Twelfth Night to be on . The difficulty may come from the use of the words &quot;eve&quot; which is defined as &quot;the day or evening before an event&quot;, however, especially in antiquated usage could be used to simply mean &quot;evening&quot;.

Bruce Forbes writes:In 567 the Council of Tours proclaimed that the entire period between Christmas and Epiphany should be considered part of the celebration, creating what became known as the twelve days of Christmas, or what the English called Christmastide. On the last of the twelve days, called Twelfth Night, various cultures developed a wide range of additional special festivities. The variation extends even to the issue of how to count the days. If Christmas Day is the first of the twelve days, then Twelfth Night would be on January 5, the eve of Epiphany. If December 26, the day after Christmas, is the first day, then Twelfth Night falls on January 6, the evening of Epiphany itself.

The Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, celebrates Twelfth Night on the 5th and &quot;refers to the night before Epiphany, the day when the nativity story tells us that the wise men visited the infant Jesus&quot;.

== Origins and history ==
In AD 567, the Council of Tours &quot;proclaimed the twelve days from Christmas to Epiphany as a sacred and festive season, and established the duty of Advent fasting in preparation for the feast.&quot; Christopher Hill, as well as William J. Federer, states that this was done to solve the &quot;administrative problem for the Roman Empire as it tried to coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar calendars of its provinces in the east.&quot;

In medieval and Tudor England, Candlemas traditionally marked the end of the Christmas season, although later, Twelfth Night came to signal the end of Christmastide, with a new but related season of Epiphanytide running until Candlemas. A popular Twelfth Night tradition was to have a bean and pea hidden inside a Twelfth-night cake; the &quot;man who finds the bean in his slice of cake becomes King for the night while the lady who finds a pea in her slice of cake becomes Queen for the night.&quot; Following this selection, Twelfth Night parties would continue and would include the singing of Christmas carols, as well as feasting.

=== Traditions ===
Food and drink are the centre of the celebrations in modern times. All of the most traditional ones go back many centuries. The punch called wassail is consumed especially on Twelfth Night and throughout Christmas time, especially in the UK. Door-to-door wassailing (similar to singing Christmas carols) as well as orchard wassailing were both historically common in the UK and are still practiced to a certain extent today. Around the world, special pastries, such as the tortell and king cake, are baked on Twelfth Night, and eaten the following day for the Feast of the Epiphany celebrations.

In parts of Kent, there is a tradition that an edible decoration would be the last part of Christmas to be removed in the Twelfth Night and shared amongst the family.

The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London has had a tradition since 1795 of providing a Twelfth Night cake. The will of Robert Baddeley made a bequest of £100 to provide cake and punch every year for the company in residence at the theatre on 6 January. The tradition continues.

In Ireland, it is still the tradition to place the statues of the Three Kings in the crib on the Twelfth Night or, at the latest, the following day, Little Christmas.

In colonial America, a Christmas wreath was always left up on the front door of each home. When taken down at the end of the Twelve Days of Christmas, any edible portions would be consumed with the other foods of the feast. The same held true in the 19th–20th centuries with fruits adorning Christmas trees. Fresh fruits were hard to come by and were therefore considered fine and proper gifts and decorations for the tree, wreaths, and home. Again, the tree would be taken down on the Twelfth Night, and such fruits, along with nuts and other local produce used, would then be consumed. 

Modern American Carnival traditions are seen across former French colonies, most notably in New Orleans and Mobile. In the mid-twentieth century, friends gathered for weekly king cake parties. Whoever got the slice with the &quot;king&quot;, usually in the form of a miniature baby doll (symbolic of the Christ Child, &quot;Christ the King&quot;), hosted the next week&#x27;s party. Traditionally, this was a bean for the king and a pea for the queen. Parties centred around king cakes are no longer common and king cake today is usually brought to the workplace or served at parties, the recipient of the plastic baby being obligated to bring the next king cake to the next function. In some countries, Twelfth Night and Epiphany mark the start of the Carnival season, which lasts through Mardi Gras Day.

In Spain, Twelfth Night is called &quot;Cabalgata de Reyes&quot; (&quot;Parade of Kings&quot;), and historically the &quot;kings&quot; would go through towns and hand out sweets.

In France, &quot;La Galette des Rois&quot; (&quot;Kings&#x27; Cake&quot;) is eaten all month long. The cakes vary depending on the region; in northern France, it is called a &quot;galette&quot; and is filled with &quot;frangipane&quot;, fruit, or chocolate. In the south, it is more of a brioche with candied fruit.

=== Suppression ===
Twelfth Night in the Netherlands became so secularised, rowdy, and boisterous that public celebrations were banned by the Church.

===Old Twelfth Night===
In some places, particularly in the West Country, Old Twelfth Night (or &quot;Old Twelvey&quot;) is still celebrated on 17 January. This continues the custom of the Apple Wassail on the date that corresponded to 6 January on the Julian calendar at the time of the change in calendars enacted by the Calendar Act 1750.

== In literature ==
It is unknown whether Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Twelfth Night, or What You Will&quot; was written to be performed as a Twelfth Night entertainment, since there is no record of the circumstances of its composition. The earliest known performance took place at Middle Temple Hall, one of the Inns of Court, on Candlemas night, 2 February 1602. The play has many elements that are reversed, in the tradition of Twelfth Night, such as a woman Viola dressing as a man, and a servant Malvolio imagining that he can become a nobleman.

Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot; was performed on 6 January 1605 at the Banqueting House in Whitehall. It was originally entitled &quot;The Twelfth Nights Revells&quot;. The accompanying Masque, &quot;The Masque of Beauty&quot; was performed in the same court the Sunday night after the Twelfth Night in 1608.

Robert Herrick&#x27;s poem &quot;Twelfth-Night, or King and Queene&quot;, published in 1648, describes the election of king and queen by bean and pea in a plum cake, and the homage done to them by the draining of wassail bowls of &quot;lamb&#x27;s-wool&quot;, a drink of sugar, nutmeg, ginger, and ale.

Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; briefly mentions Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Present visiting a children&#x27;s Twelfth Night party.

In chapter 6 of Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s 1858 novel &quot;Mervyn Clitheroe&quot;, the eponymous hero is elected King of festivities at the Twelfth Night celebrations held in Tom Shakeshaft&#x27;s barn by receiving the slice of plum cake containing the bean; his companion Cissy obtains the pea and becomes queen, and they are seated together in a high corner to view the proceedings. The distribution has been rigged to prevent another person from gaining the role. The festivities include country dances, the introduction of a &quot;Fool Plough&quot;, a plough decked with ribands brought into the barn by a dozen mummers together with a grotesque &quot;Old Bessie&quot; (played by a man), and a Fool dressed in animal skins with a fool&#x27;s hat. The mummers carry wooden swords and perform revelries. The scene in the novel is illustrated by Hablot Knight Browne (&quot;Phiz&quot;). In the course of the evening, the fool&#x27;s antics cause a fight to break out, but Mervyn restores order. Three bowls of gin punch are disposed of. At eleven o&#x27;clock, the young men make the necessary arrangements to see the young ladies safely home across the fields.

&quot;The Dead&quot;the final, novella-length story in James Joyce&#x27;s 1914 collection &quot;Dubliners&quot;opens on Twelfth Night, or Epiphany Eve, and extends into the early morning hours of Epiphany itself. Critics and writers consider the story &quot;just about the finest short story in the English language&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest short stories ever written&quot;. Its adaptations include a play, a Broadway musical, and two films. The story begins at the bustling and sumptuous annual dance hosted by Kate Morkan and Julia Morkan, aunts to Gabriel Conroy, the main character. Throughout the festivities, a series of minor obligations and awkward encounters leaves Gabriel with a sense of unease, inducing self-doubt, or at least doubt in the person he presents himself as. This unease sharpens during a dinner speech in which Gabriel grandiosely ponders whether because &quot;...we are living in a skeptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age&quot;, the generation currently coming of age in Ireland will begin to &quot;lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humor which belonged to an older day.&quot; High spirits and singing soon resume. Gabriel and his wife Gretta depart for their hotel in the early morning hours. This destination for Gabriel kindles both erotic possibility and deep love. However, at the hotel, Gretta, moved by a song they had just heard sung at the party, offers a tearful, long-withheld revelation that momentarily shatters Gabriel&#x27;s feelings of warmth, leaving him shaken and bewildered. After Gretta drifts off to sleep, Gabriel, still rapt in the emotional wake of her revelation, gazes out the window at the falling snow and experiences a profound and unifying epiphany, one that reconciles the fears, doubts, and façades that had haunted him throughout the evening and, he seems to recognise, throughout his life to that point.

<text>Twelfth Night, or What You Will is a romantic comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written around 1601–1602 as a Twelfth Night entertainment for the close of the Christmas season. The play centres on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck. Viola (disguised as a page named &#x27;Cesario&#x27;) falls in love with the Duke Orsino, who in turn is in love with Countess Olivia. Upon meeting Viola, Countess Olivia falls in love with her, thinking she is a man.

The play expanded on the musical interludes and riotous disorder expected of the occasion, with plot elements drawn from Barnabe Rich&#x27;s short story &quot;Of Apollonius and Silla&quot;, based on a story by Matteo Bandello. The first documented public performance was on 2 February 1602, at Candlemas, the formal end of Christmastide in the year&#x27;s calendar. The play was not published until its inclusion in the 1623 First Folio.

==Characters==
* Viola – a shipwrecked young woman who disguises herself as a page named Cesario 
* Sebastian – Viola&#x27;s twin brother
* Duke Orsino – Duke of Illyria
* Olivia – a wealthy countess
* Malvolio – steward in Olivia&#x27;s household
* Maria – Olivia&#x27;s gentlewoman
* Sir Toby Belch – Olivia&#x27;s uncle
* Sir Andrew Aguecheek – a friend of Sir Toby
* Feste – Olivia&#x27;s servant, a jester
* Fabian – a servant in Olivia&#x27;s household
* Antonio – a sea captain and friend to Sebastian
* Valentine and Curio – gentlemen attending on the Duke
* A Sea Captain – a friend to Viola
==Synopsis==

Viola is shipwrecked on the coast of Illyria and comes ashore with a captain&#x27;s help. She has lost contact with her twin brother, Sebastian, who she believes has drowned, and with the aid of the Captain, she disguises herself as a young man named Cesario and enters the service of Duke Orsino. Orsino has convinced himself he is in love with Olivia, who is mourning her brother&#x27;s recent death. Olivia refuses to see entertainments, be in the company of men, or accept love or marriage proposals from anyone, including Orsino, until seven years have passed. Orsino then uses &#x27;Cesario&#x27; as an intermediary to profess his passionate love for Olivia. But Olivia falls in love with &#x27;Cesario&#x27;, setting her at odds with her professed duty. Meanwhile, Viola has fallen in love with Orsino, creating a love triangle: Viola loves Orsino, Orsino loves Olivia, and Olivia loves Viola disguised as Cesario.
In the comic subplot, several characters conspire to make Olivia&#x27;s pompous steward, Malvolio, believe that she has fallen for him. This involves Olivia&#x27;s riotous uncle, Sir Toby Belch; another would-be suitor, the silly squire Sir Andrew Aguecheek; Olivia&#x27;s servants Maria and Fabian; and Olivia&#x27;s witty fool, Feste. Sir Toby and Sir Andrew engage themselves in drinking and revelry, disrupting the peace of Olivia&#x27;s household until late into the night, prompting Malvolio to chastise them. Sir Toby famously retorts,
: &quot;Dost thou think, because &quot;thou&quot; art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?&quot; (Act II, Scene III).
Maria suggests taking revenge on Malvolio by convincing him that Olivia is secretly in love with him. She forges a love letter, mimicking Olivia&#x27;s handwriting, and plants it in the garden. The letter asks Malvolio to wear yellow stockings cross-gartered—a colour and fashion that Olivia hates, to be rude to the rest of the servants, and to smile constantly in Olivia&#x27;s presence. Watched by Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian, Malvolio finds the letter and is surprised and delighted. He starts following the letter&#x27;s instructions to show Olivia his feelings. Olivia is shocked by the changes in him and, agreeing that he seems mad, leaves him to be cared for by his tormentors. Pretending that Malvolio is insane, the tormentors lock him in a dark chamber. Feste visits Malvolio to mock Malvolio&#x27;s professed insanity, both as himself and disguised as a priest.

Meanwhile, Viola&#x27;s twin, Sebastian, has been rescued by Antonio, a sea captain who previously fought Orsino, yet who accompanies Sebastian to Illyria, despite the danger, because of his admiration for Sebastian.

With their love for practical jokes, Sir Toby and Fabian convince Sir Andrew to challenge Cesario to a duel, knowing that neither of them can fight. Their initial duel is interrupted by Antonio, who believes Cesario to be Sebastian. Orsino&#x27;s officers then arrest Antonio. Emboldened by this, Sir Andrew mistakes Sebastian for Cesario and slaps him, prompting Sebastian to beat up Sir Andrew. Olivia witnesses the skirmish and chastises Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian. Taking Sebastian for &#x27;Cesario&#x27;, Olivia asks him to marry her, and they are secretly married in a church. Finally, when &#x27;Cesario&#x27; and Sebastian appear in the presence of both Olivia and Orsino, there is more wonder and confusion at their physical similarity. At this point, Viola reveals her identity and is reunited with her brother.

Sebastian and Viola reunite, and the cases of mistaken identity are resolved. Orsino and Viola marry (Orsino to Viola: &quot;But when in other habits you are seen, Orsino&#x27;s mistress, and his fancy&#x27;s queen&quot;), and Antonio is released. Fabian confesses the plot against Malvolio, and reveals that Sir Toby has married Maria. Malvolio swears revenge on his tormentors and stalks off, but Orsino sends Fabian to placate him. The plays end with a song sung by Feste.

==Setting==
Illyria, the exotic setting of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, is important to the play&#x27;s romantic atmosphere.

Illyria was an ancient region of the Western Balkans whose coast (the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, the only part of ancient Illyria relevant to the play) covered (from north to south) the coasts of modern-day Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania. It included the city-state of the Republic of Ragusa, which has been proposed as the setting, and which is today known as Dubrovnik, Croatia.

Illyria may have been suggested by the Roman comedy &quot;Menaechmi&quot;, the plot of which also involves twins who are mistaken for each other. Illyria is also referred to as a site of pirates in Shakespeare&#x27;s earlier play, &quot;Henry VI, Part 2.&quot; Most of the characters&#x27; names are Italian but some of the comic characters have English names. Oddly, the &quot;Illyrian&quot; lady Olivia has an English uncle, Sir Toby Belch.

It has been noted that the play&#x27;s setting has other English allusions, such as Viola&#x27;s use of &quot;Westward ho!&quot;, a typical cry of 16th-century London boatmen, and Antonio&#x27;s recommendation to Sebastian of &quot;The Elephant&quot; as the best place to lodge in Illyria (The Elephant was a pub not far from the Globe Theatre).

==Sources==
The play is believed to have drawn extensively on the Italian production &quot;Gl&#x27;ingannati&quot; (&quot;The Deceived Ones&quot;), collectively written by the &quot;Accademia degli Intronati&quot; of Siena in 1531. It is conjectured that the name of its male lead, Orsino, was suggested by Virginio Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, an Italian nobleman who visited London in the winter of 1600–01.

Another source story, &quot;Of Apollonius and Silla&quot;, appeared in Barnabe Riche&#x27;s collection &quot;Riche his Farewell to Militarie Profession conteining verie pleasaunt discourses fit for a peaceable tyme&quot; (1581), which in turn derives from a story by Matteo Bandello.

&quot;Twelfth Night&quot; is a reference to the twelfth night after Christmas Day, also called the &quot;Eve of the Feast of Epiphany&quot;. It was originally a Catholic holiday, and these were sometimes occasions for revelry, like other Christian feast days. Servants often dressed up as their masters, men as women, and so forth. This history of festive ritual and carnivalesque reversal is the cultural origin of the play&#x27;s gender-confusion-driven plot. Puritans often opposed Epiphany celebrations, much as Malvolio opposes the revelry in the play.

The actual Elizabethan festival of Twelfth Night involved the antics of a Lord of Misrule, who, before leaving his temporary position of authority, called for entertainment, songs, and mummery; the play has been regarded as preserving this festive and traditional atmosphere of licensed disorder. This leads to the general inversion of the order of things, most notably gender roles. The embittered and isolated Malvolio can be regarded as an adversary of festive enjoyment and community. That community is led by Sir Toby Belch, &quot;the vice-regent spokesman for cakes and ale&quot;, and his partner in a comic stock duo, the simple and constantly exploited Sir Andrew Aguecheek.

==Date and text==

The full title of the play is &quot;Twelfth Night, or What You Will&quot;. Subtitles for plays were fashionable in the Elizabethan era, and though some editors place &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;″s alternative title, &quot;The Jew of Venice&quot;, as a subtitle, this is the only Shakespeare play to bear one when first published.

The play was probably finished between 1600 and 1601, a period suggested by the play&#x27;s referencing of events that happened during that time. A law student, John Manningham, who was studying in the Middle Temple in London, described the performance on 2 February 1602 (Candlemas) which took place in the hall of the Middle Temple at the formal end of Christmastide in the year&#x27;s calendar, and to which students were invited. This was the first recorded public performance of the play. The play was not published until its inclusion in the First Folio in 1623.

==Themes==

===Gender===
Viola is not alone among Shakespeare&#x27;s cross-dressing heroines; in Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre, convention dictated that adolescent boys play female characters, creating humour in the multiplicity of disguise found in a female character who for a while pretended at masculinity. Her cross-dressing enables Viola to fulfil usually male roles, such as acting as a messenger between Orsino and Olivia or serving as Orsino&#x27;s confidant. But she does not use her disguise to intervene directly in the plot (unlike other Shakespearean heroines, such as Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; and Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;), remaining someone who allows &quot;Time&quot; to untangle the plot. 

As &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; explores gender identity and sexual attraction, having a male actor play Viola enhanced the impression of androgyny and sexual ambiguity. Some modern scholars believe that &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, with the added confusion of male actors and Viola&#x27;s deception, addresses gender issues &quot;with particular immediacy&quot;. They also accept that its depiction of gender stems from the era&#x27;s prevalent scientific theory that females are simply imperfect males. This belief explains the almost indistinguishable differences between the sexes reflected in the play&#x27;s casting and characters.

===Metatheatre===
At Olivia&#x27;s first meeting with &quot;Cesario&quot; (Viola) in Act I, Scene v she asks her &quot;Are you a comedian?&quot; (an Elizabethan term for &quot;actor&quot;). Viola&#x27;s reply, &quot;I am not that I play&quot;, epitomising her adoption of the role of &quot;Cesario&quot; (Viola), is regarded as one of the play&#x27;s several references to theatricality and &quot;playing&quot;. The plot against Malvolio revolves around these ideas, and Fabian remarks in Act III, Scene iv: &quot;If this were play&#x27;d upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction&quot;. In Act IV, Scene ii, Feste (The Fool) plays both parts in the &quot;play&quot; for Malvolio&#x27;s benefit, alternating between adopting the voice of the local curate, Sir Topas, and his own voice. He finishes by likening himself to &quot;the old Vice&quot; of English Morality plays. Other influences of the English folk tradition can be seen in Feste&#x27;s songs and dialogue, such as his final song in Act V. The last line of this song, &quot;And we&#x27;ll strive to please you every day&quot;, echoes similar lines from several English folk plays.

==Performance history==

===During and just after Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime===
Some scholars argue that &quot;Twelfth Night, or What You Will&quot; (the play&#x27;s full title) was probably commissioned for performance as part of the Twelfth Night celebrations held by Queen Elizabeth I at Whitehall Palace on 6 January 1601 to mark the end of the embassy of the Italian diplomat, the Duke of Orsino. Others dispute this, arguing that the &quot;rigid etiquette of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s court&quot; would have made it &quot;impossible&quot; for Shakespeare to name a main character in a comedy for the very diplomat attending the performance, and that it is more likely that Shakespeare used the name from the 1601 diplomatic visit when writing his play, which premiered the next winter. It was again performed at Court on Easter Monday in 1618 and on Candlemas night in 1623.

The earliest public performance took place at Middle Temple Hall, one of the Inns of Court, on 2 February (Candlemas night) 1602. The lawyer John Manningham wrote in his diary:
Clearly, Manningham enjoyed the Malvolio story most of all, and noted the play&#x27;s similarity to Shakespeare&#x27;s earlier play, as well as its relationship with one of its sources, the &quot;Inganni&quot; plays.

===Restoration to 20th century===
The play was one of the earliest Shakespearean works acted at the start of the Restoration; Sir William Davenant&#x27;s adaptation was staged in 1661, with Thomas Betterton as Sir Toby Belch. Samuel Pepys thought it &quot;a silly play&quot;, but saw it three times anyway during the period of his diary on 11 September 1661, 6 January 1663, and 20 January 1669. Another adaptation, &quot;Love Betray&#x27;d, or, The Agreeable Disappointment&quot;, was acted at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1703.

After holding the stage only in the adaptations in the late 17th century and early 18th century, the original Shakespearean text of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was revived in 1741, in a production at Drury Lane. In 1820 an operatic version by Frederic Reynolds was staged, with music by Henry Bishop.

===20th and 21st century===
Influential productions were staged in 1912, by Harley Granville-Barker, and in 1916, at the Old Vic.

Lilian Baylis reopened the long-dormant Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in 1931 with a notable production of the play starring Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby and John Gielgud as Malvolio. The Old Vic Theatre was reopened in 1950 (after suffering severe damage in the London Blitz in 1941) with a memorable production starring Peggy Ashcroft as Viola. Gielgud directed a production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre with Laurence Olivier as Malvolio and Vivien Leigh playing both Viola and Sebastian in 1955. The longest-running Broadway production by far was Margaret Webster&#x27;s 1940 staging starring Maurice Evans as Malvolio and Helen Hayes as Viola. It ran for 129 performances, more than twice as long as any other Broadway production.

A memorable production directed by Liviu Ciulei at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis in 1984 was set in the context of an archetypal circus world, emphasising the play&#x27;s convivial, carnivalesque tone.

When the play was first performed, all female parts were played by men or boys, but it has been the practice for some centuries now to cast women or girls in the female parts in all plays. The company of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, London, has produced many notable, highly popular all-male performances, and a highlight of their 2002 season was &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, with the Globe&#x27;s artistic director Mark Rylance playing Olivia. This season was preceded, in February, by a performance of the play by the same company at Middle Temple Hall, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the play&#x27;s première, at the same venue. Stephen Fry played Malvolio when the same production was revived in 2012–13, later transferring to sell-out runs in the West End and Broadway; it ran in repertory with &quot;Richard III&quot;.

Many renowned actresses have played Viola in the latter half of the 20th century, and their performances been interpreted in the light of how far they allow the audience to experience the transgression of stereotypical gender roles. This has sometimes correlated with how far productions of the play go towards reaffirming a sense of unification; for example, a 1947 production concentrated on showing a post-World War II community reuniting at the end of the play, led by a robust hero / heroine in Viola, played by Beatrix Lehmann, then 44 years old. The 1966 Royal Shakespeare Company production played on gender transgressions more obviously, with Diana Rigg as Viola showing much more physical attraction towards the duke than previously seen, and the court in general being a more physically demonstrative place, particularly between males. John Barton&#x27;s 1969 production starred Donald Sinden as Malvolio and Judi Dench as Viola; their performances were highly acclaimed and the production as a whole was said to show a society crumbling into decay.

Malvolio is a popular character choice among stage actors; he has been portrayed by Ian Holm many times, Simon Russell Beale (Donmar Warehouse, 2002), Richard Cordery (2005), Patrick Stewart, (Chichester, 2007), Derek Jacobi (Donmar Warehouse, 2009), Richard Wilson (2009), and Stephen Fry (The Globe, 2012).

In 2017, the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; changed some of the roles from male to female, including Feste, Fabian (who became Fabia), and, most notably, Malvolio – who became Malvolia – played by Tamsin Greig to largely positive reviews. As a result, the production played with sexuality as well as gender.

In 2017–18, the Royal Shakespeare Company staged a production directed by Christopher Luscombe; Adrian Edmondson played Malvolio, Kara Tointon Olivia, and Dinita Gohil Viola.

In 2022, Old Fruit Jar Productions staged a 1980s-inspired twist on the play at Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool, swapping lords and ladies of stately homes for rowdy Benidorm bars and booze-fuelled escapades, as an introduction to Shakespeare for audiences unfamiliar with his work.

==Adaptations==
===Stage===

==== Musicals ====
Due to its themes such as young women seeking independence in a &quot;man&#x27;s world&quot;, &quot;gender bending&quot; and &quot;same sex attraction&quot;, there have been a number of re-workings for the stage, particularly in musical theatre, among them &quot;Your Own Thing&quot; (1968), &quot;Music Is&quot; (1977), &quot;All Shook Up&quot; (2005), and &quot;Play On!&quot; (1997), the last two jukebox musicals featuring the music of Elvis Presley and Duke Ellington, respectively. Another adaptation is &quot;Illyria&quot; (2002) by composer Pete Mills, which continues to perform regularly throughout the United States. In 2018, the Public Theatre workshopped and premiered a musical adaptation of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with original music by Shaina Taub, who also played the role of Feste. In 1999, the play was adapted as &quot;Epiphany&quot; by the Takarazuka Revue, adding more overt commentary on the role of theatre and actors, as well as gender as applied to the stage (made more layered by the fact that all roles in this production were played by women).
There are many new modern plays but mostly still played in Early Modern English.

==== Plays ====
Theatre Grottesco, a Lecocq-inspired company based out of Santa Fe, New Mexico, created a modern version of the play from the point of view of the servants working for Duke Orsino and Lady Olivia, entitled &quot;Grottesco&#x27;s 12&quot;th &quot;Night&quot; (2008). The adaptation takes a much deeper look at the issues of classism, and society without leadership. In New York City, Turn to Flesh Productions, a theatre company that specializes in creating &quot;new Shakespeare shows&quot;, developed two plays focused on Malvolio: &quot;A Comedy of Heirors, or The Imposters&quot; by verse playwright, Emily C. A. Snyder, which imagined a disgraced Malvolio chasing down two pairs of female twins in Syracuse and Ephesus, and &quot;Malvolio&#x27;s Revenge&quot; by verse playwright, Duncan Pflaster, a queer sequel to &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Both plays were originally written for submission to the American Shakespeare Center&#x27;s call for plays in conversation with the Bard through the Shakespeare&#x27;s New Contemporaries program.

===Film===

*1910: Vitagraph Studios released the silent, short adaptation &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; starring actors Florence Turner, Julia Swayne Gordon, and Marin Sais.
*1985: &quot;Just One of the Guys&quot;, directed by Lisa Gottlieb titled, is a loose update of the story set in a modern high school. 
*1986: &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, an Australian production.
*1996: &quot;Twelfth Night, Or What You Will&quot;, adapted and directed by Trevor Nunn and set in the 19th century, stars Imogen Stubbs as Viola, Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia, and Toby Stephens as Duke Orsino. The film also features Mel Smith as Sir Toby, Richard E. Grant as Sir Andrew, Ben Kingsley as Feste, Imelda Staunton as Maria, and Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio. Much of the comic material was downplayed into straightforward drama, and the film received some criticism for this.
*1998: &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; contains several references to &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. &quot;Viola&quot; (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the daughter of a wealthy merchant who disguises herself as a boy to become an actor. Near the end of the movie, Elizabeth I (Judi Dench) asks Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) to write a comedy for the Twelfth Night holiday. Viola is presented in the final scene of the film as Shakespeare&#x27;s inspiration for the heroine of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. In a nod to the shipwrecked opening of the play, the movie includes a scene where the character Viola, separated from her love by an arranged marriage and bound for the American colonies, survives a shipwreck and comes ashore to Virginia.
*2001: Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Motocrossed&quot; sets the story in the world of motocross racing.
*2004: &quot;Wicker Park&quot; has Rose Byrne&#x27;s character Alex plays Viola in an amateur production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.
*2006: &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot; updates the story as a contemporary teenage comedy. It is set in a prep school named Illyria and incorporates the names of the play&#x27;s major characters. The story was changed to revolve around the idea of soccer rivalry but the twisted character romance remained the same as the original. Viola, the main character, pretends to be her brother Sebastian, and a girl named Olivia falls in love with Viola as Sebastian. Two of Duke&#x27;s Illyria soccer teammates are named Andrew and Toby. A nod is given to the omitted subplot by naming a briefly-onscreen tarantula Malvolio. Sebastian&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Monique was given the surname Valentine, the meddling Malcolm was given the surname Festes, and Viola&#x27;s friend and hair stylist Paul was given the surname Antonio.
*2018: Adam Smethurst adapted and directed this version set in the 21st century. The film stars Sheila Atim as Viola and Sebastian, Dominic Coleman as Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Zackary Momoh as Antonio, and Simon Nagra as Sir Toby Belch.

===Television===
On 14 May 1937, the BBC Television Service in London broadcast a thirty-minute excerpt of the play, the first known instance of a work of Shakespeare being performed on television. Produced for the new medium by George More O&#x27;Ferrall, the production is also notable for having featured a young actress who would later go on to win an Academy Award – Greer Garson. As the performance was transmitted live from the BBC&#x27;s studios at Alexandra Palace and the technology to record television programmes did not at the time exist, no visual record survives other than still photographs.

The entire play was produced for television in 1939, directed by Michel Saint-Denis and starring another future Oscar-winner, Peggy Ashcroft. The part of Sir Toby Belch was taken by a young George Devine.

In 1957, another adaptation of the play was presented by NBC on U.S. television&#x27;s &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, with Maurice Evans recreating his performance as Malvolio. This was the first colour version ever produced on TV. Dennis King, Rosemary Harris, and Frances Hyland co-starred.

In 1964, there was a Canadian TV version directed by George McCowan with Martha Henry as &quot;Viola&quot;, then in 1966 there was an Australian TV version.

Another version for UK television was produced in 1969, directed by John Sichel and John Dexter. The production featured Joan Plowright as Viola and Sebastian, Alec Guinness as Malvolio, Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch, and Tommy Steele as an unusually prominent Feste.

Yet another TV adaptation followed in 1980. This version was part of the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series and featured Felicity Kendal in the role of Viola, Sinéad Cusack as Olivia, Alec McCowen as Malvolio, and Robert Hardy as Sir Toby Belch.

In 1988, Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s stage production of the play, starring Frances Barber as Viola and Richard Briers as Malvolio, was adapted for Thames Television.

In 1998 the Lincoln Center Theater production directed by Nicholas Hytner was broadcast on PBS Live From Lincoln Center. It starred Helen Hunt as Viola, Paul Rudd as Orsino, Kyra Sedgwick as Olivia, Philip Bosco as Malvolio, Brian Murray as Sir Toby, Max Wright as Sir Andrew, and David Patrick Kelly as Feste.

A 2003 tele-movie adapted and directed by Tim Supple is set in the present day. It features David Troughton as Sir Toby, and is notable for its multi-ethnic cast including Parminder Nagra as Viola and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orsino. Its portrayal of Viola and Sebastian&#x27;s arrival in Illyria is reminiscent of news footage of asylum seekers.

An episode of the British series &quot;Skins&quot;, entitled Grace, featured the main characters playing Twelfth Night, with a love triangle between Franky, Liv and Matty, who respectively played Viola, Olivia, and Orsino.

===Radio===
An adaptation of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; by Cathleen Nesbitt for the BBC was the first complete Shakespeare play ever broadcast on British radio. This occurred on 28 May 1923, with Nesbitt as both Viola and Sebastian, and Gerald Lawrence as Orsino.

In 1937, an adaptation was performed on the &quot;CBS Radio Playhouse&quot; starring Orson Welles as Orsino and Tallulah Bankhead as Viola. A year later, Welles played Malvolio in a production with his Mercury Theater Company.

There have been several full adaptations on BBC Radio. A 1982 BBC Radio 4 broadcast featured Alec McCowen as Orsino, Wendy Murray as Viola, Norman Rodway as Sir Toby Belch, Andrew Sachs as Sir Andrew Aguecheek, and Bernard Hepton as Malvolio; in 1993, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a version of the play (set on a Caribbean Island), with Michael Maloney as Orsino, Eve Matheson as Viola, Iain Cuthbertson as Malvolio, and Joss Ackland as Sir Toby Belch; this adaptation was broadcast again on 6 January 2011 by BBC Radio 7 (now Radio 4 Extra). 1998 saw another Radio 3 adaptation, with Michael Maloney, again as Orsino, Josette Simon as Olivia and Nicky Henson as Feste. In April 2012, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a version directed by Sally Avens, with Paul Ready as Orsino, Naomi Frederick as Viola, David Tennant as Malvolio, and Ron Cook as Sir Toby Belch.

=== Music ===
Operas based on &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; include Bedřich Smetana&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Viola&quot; (1874, 1883–1884), Karel Weis&#x27;s &quot;Blíženci&quot; (1892, 2nd version 1917), Ivan Jirko&#x27;s &quot;Večer tříkrálový&quot; (1964) and Jan Klusák&#x27;s &quot;Dvanáctá noc&quot; (1989).

A stage music based on &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was composed in 1907 by Engelbert Humperdinck, famous for his fairy-tale opera &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;.

Overtures based on &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; have been composed by Alexander Campbell Mackenzie (1888); Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and Johan Wagenaar.

In 1943, Korngold also set the songs &quot;Adieu, Good Man Devil&quot; (Act IV, Scene 2), &quot;Hey, Robin&quot; (Act IV, Scene 2), and &quot;For the Rain, It Raineth Every Day&quot; (Act V, Scene 1) as the song cycle &quot;Narrenlieder&quot;, Op. 29.

==Influence==

The play consistently ranks among the greatest plays ever written and has been dubbed &quot;The Perfect Comedy&quot;. The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard opens his 1844 book &quot;Philosophical Fragments&quot; with the quote &quot;Better well hanged than ill wed&quot;, a paraphrase of Feste&#x27;s comment to Maria in Act 1, Scene 5: &quot;Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage&quot;. Nietzsche also refers passingly to &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (specifically, to Sir Andrew Aguecheek&#x27;s suspicion, expressed in Act 1, Scene 3, that his excessive intake of beef is having an inverse effect on his wit) in the third essay of his &quot;Genealogy of Morality&quot;.

Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1940 mystery novel &quot;Sad Cypress&quot; draws its title from a song in Act II, Scene IV of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

The protagonists of Vita Sackville-West&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;The Edwardians&quot; are named Sebastian and Viola, and are brother and sister. In her introduction to the novel, Victoria Glendinning writes: &quot;Sebastian is the boy-heir that Vita would like to have been... Viola is very like the girl that Vita actually was.&quot;

American playwright Ken Ludwig wrote a play inspired by the details of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, called &quot;Leading Ladies.&quot;

Cassandra Clare&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;City of Glass&quot; contains chapter names inspired by quotations of Antonio and Sebastian.

British Neoprog band Twelfth Night is named after the play.

Two of the dogs in the film &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot; are twins called Sebastian and Viola.

Clive Barker&#x27;s short story &quot;Sex, Death and Starshine&quot; revolves around a doomed production of &quot;Twelfth Night.&quot;

The Baker Street Irregulars believe Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s birthday to be 6 January due to the fact that Holmes quotes twice from &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; whereas he quotes only once from other Shakespeare plays.

The &quot;Kiddy Grade&quot; characters Viola and Cesario are named for Viola and her alter ego Cesario.

Elizabeth Hand&#x27;s novella &quot;Illyria&quot; features a high school production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, containing many references to the play, especially Feste&#x27;s song.

The 2006 romantic comedy &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot; is loosely based on &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

One of &quot;Club Penguin&quot;″s plays, &quot;Twelfth Fish&quot;, is a spoof of Shakespeare&#x27;s works. It is a story about a countess, a jester, and a bard who catch a fish that talks. As the play ends, they begin eating the fish. Many of the lines are parodies of Shakespeare.

Sara Farizan&#x27;s 2014 young adult novel &quot;Tell Me Again How A Crush Should Feel&quot; features a high school production of the play, where the &quot;new girl&quot; Saskia plays Viola/Cesario and catches the attention of the main character, Leila.

Vidyadhar Gokhale&#x27;s play &quot;Madanachi Manjiri&quot; (मदनाची मंजिरी) is an adaptation of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

<text>In industrial process engineering, mixing is a unit operation that involves manipulation of a heterogeneous physical system with the intent to make it more homogeneous. Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration).

Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers.

With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders.

The opposite of mixing is segregation. A classical example of segregation is the brazil nut effect.
The mathematics of mixing is highly abstract, and is a part of ergodic theory, itself a part of chaos theory.

The type of operation and equipment used during mixing depends on the state of materials being mixed (liquid, semi-solid, or solid) and the miscibility of the materials being processed. In this context, the act of mixing may be synonymous with stirring-, or kneading-processes.

== Liquid–liquid mixing ==
Mixing of liquids occurs frequently in process engineering. The nature of liquids to blend determines the equipment used. Single-phase blending tends to involve low-shear, high-flow mixers to cause liquid engulfment, while multi-phase mixing generally requires the use of high-shear, low-flow mixers to create droplets of one liquid in laminar, turbulent or transitional flow regimes, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow. Turbulent or transitional mixing is frequently conducted with turbines or impellers; laminar mixing is conducted with helical ribbon or anchor mixers.

===Single-phase blending===
Mixing of liquids that are miscible or at least soluble in each other occurs frequently in engineering (and in everyday life). An everyday example would be the addition of milk or cream to tea or coffee. Since both liquids are water-based, they dissolve easily in one another. The momentum of the liquid being added is sometimes enough to cause enough turbulence to mix the two, since the viscosity of both liquids is relatively low. If necessary, a spoon or paddle could be used to complete the mixing process. Blending in a more viscous liquid, such as honey, requires more mixing power per unit volume to achieve the same homogeneity in the same amount of time.

==Gas–gas mixing==
==Solid–solid mixing==
Dry blenders are a type of industrial mixer which are typically used to blend multiple dry components until they are homogeneous. Often minor liquid additions are made to the dry blend to modify the product formulation. Blending times using dry ingredients are often short (15–30 minutes) but are somewhat dependent upon the varying percentages of each component, and the difference in the bulk densities of each. Ribbon, paddle, tumble and vertical blenders are available. Many products including pharmaceuticals, foods, chemicals, fertilizers, plastics, pigments, and cosmetics are manufactured in these designs. Dry blenders range in capacity from half-cubic-foot laboratory models to 500-cubic-foot production units. A wide variety of horsepower-and-speed combinations and optional features such as sanitary finishes, vacuum construction, special valves and cover openings are offered by most manufacturers.

Blending powders is one of the oldest unit-operations in the solids handling industries. For many decades powder blending has been used just to homogenize bulk materials. Many different machines have been designed to handle materials with various bulk solids properties. On the basis of the practical experience gained with these different machines, engineering knowledge has been developed to construct reliable equipment and to predict scale-up and mixing behavior. Nowadays the same mixing technologies are used for many more applications: to improve product quality, to coat particles, to fuse materials, to wet, to disperse in liquid, to agglomerate, to alter functional material properties, etc.
This wide range of applications of mixing equipment requires a high level of knowledge, long time experience and extended test facilities to come to the optimal selection of equipment and processes.

Solid-solid mixing can be performed either in batch mixers, which is the simpler form of mixing, or in certain cases in continuous dry-mix, more complex but which provide interesting advantages in terms of segregation, capacity and validation.
One example of a solid–solid mixing process is mulling foundry molding sand, where sand, bentonite clay, fine coal dust and water are mixed to a plastic, moldable and reusable mass, applied for molding and pouring molten metal to obtain sand castings that are metallic parts for automobile, machine building, construction or other industries.

===Mixing mechanisms===
In powder two different dimensions in the mixing process can be determined: convective mixing and intensive mixing. In the case of convective mixing material in the mixer is transported from one location to another. This type of mixing leads to a less ordered state inside the mixer, the components that must be mixed are distributed over the other components. With progressing time the mixture becomes more randomly ordered. After a certain mixing time the ultimate random state is reached. Usually this type of mixing is applied for free-flowing and coarse materials.

Possible threats during macro mixing is the de-mixing of the components, since differences in size, shape or density of the different particles can lead to segregation.
When materials are cohesive, which is the case with e.g. fine particles and also with wet material, convective mixing is no longer sufficient to obtain a randomly ordered mixture. The relative strong inter-particle forces form lumps, which are not broken up by the mild transportation forces in the convective mixer. To decrease the lump size additional forces are necessary; i.e. more energy intensive mixing is required. These additional forces can either be impact forces or shear forces.

==Liquid–solid mixing==
Liquid–solid mixing is typically done to suspend coarse free-flowing solids, or to break up lumps of fine agglomerated solids. An example of the former is the mixing granulated sugar into water; an example of the latter is the mixing of flour or powdered milk into water. In the first case, the particles can be lifted into suspension (and separated from one another) by bulk motion of the fluid; in the second, the mixer itself (or the high shear field near it) must destabilize the lumps and cause them to disintegrate.

One example of a solid–liquid mixing process in industry is concrete mixing, where cement, sand, small stones or gravel and water are commingled to a homogeneous self-hardening mass, used in the construction industry.

===Solid suspension===
Suspension of solids into a liquid is done to improve the rate of mass transfer between the solid and the liquid. Examples include dissolving a solid reactant into a solvent, or suspending catalyst particles in liquid to improve the flow of reactants and products to and from the particles. The associated eddy diffusion increases the rate of mass transfer within the bulk of the fluid, and the convection of material away from the particles decreases the size of the boundary layer, where most of the resistance to mass transfer occurs. Axial-flow impellers are preferred for solid suspension because solid suspension needs momentum rather than shear, although radial-flow impellers can be used in a tank with baffles, which converts some of the rotational motion into vertical motion. When the solid is denser than the liquid (and therefore collects at the bottom of the tank), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed downwards; when the solid is less dense than the liquid (and therefore floats on top), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed upwards (though this is relatively rare). The equipment preferred for solid suspension produces large volumetric flows but not necessarily high shear; high flow-number turbine impellers, such as hydrofoils, are typically used. Multiple turbines mounted on the same shaft can reduce power draw.

The degree of homogeneity of a solid-liquid suspension can be described by the RSD (Relative Standard Deviation of the solid volume fraction field in the mixing tank). A perfect suspension would have a RSD of 0% but in practice, a RSD inferior or equal to 20% can be sufficient for the suspension to be considered homogeneous, although this is case-dependent. The RSD can be obtained by experimental measurements or by calculations. 
Measurements can be performed at full scale but this is generally unpractical, so it is common to perform measurements at small scale and use a &quot;scale-up&quot; criterion to extrapolate the RSD from small to full scale.
Calculations can be performed using a computational fluid dynamics software or by using correlations built on theoretical developments, experimental measurements and/or computational fluid dynamics data. 
Computational fluid dynamics calculations are quite accurate and can accommodate virtually any tank and agitator designs, but they require expertise and long computation time. Correlations are easy to use but are less accurate and don&#x27;t cover any possible designs. The most popular correlation is the ‘just suspended speed’ correlation published by Zwietering (1958). It&#x27;s an easy to use correlation but it is not meant for homogeneous suspension. It only provides a crude estimate of the stirring speed for ‘bad’ quality suspensions (partial suspensions) where no particle remains at the bottom for more than 1 or 2 seconds. Another equivalent correlation is the correlation from Mersmann (1998). For ‘good’ quality suspensions, some examples of useful correlations can be found in the publications of Barresi (1987), Magelli (1991), Cekinski (2010) or Macqueron (2017). Machine learning can also be used to build models way more accurate than &quot;classical&quot; correlations.

===Solid deagglomeration===
Very fine powders, such as titanium dioxide pigments, and materials that have been spray dried may agglomerate or form lumps during transportation and storage. Starchy materials or those that form gels when exposed to solvent can form lumps that are wetted on the outside but dry on the inside. These types of materials are not easily mixed into liquid with the types of mixers preferred for solid suspension because the agglomerate particles must be subjected to intense shear to be broken up. In some ways, deagglomeration of solids is similar to the blending of immiscible liquids, except for the fact that coalescence is usually not a problem. An everyday example of this type of mixing is the production of milkshakes from liquid milk and solid ice cream.

==Liquid–gas mixing==
Liquids and gases are typically mixed to allow mass transfer to occur. For instance, in the case of air stripping, gas is used to remove volatiles from a liquid. Typically, a packed column is used for this purpose, with the packing acting as a motionless mixer and the air pump providing the driving force. When a tank and impeller are used, the objective is typically to ensure that the gas bubbles remain in contact with the liquid for as long as possible. This is especially important if the gas is expensive, such as pure oxygen, or diffuses slowly into the liquid. Mixing in a tank is also useful when a (relatively) slow chemical reaction is occurring in the liquid phase, and so the concentration difference in the thin layer near the bubble is close to that of the bulk. This reduces the driving force for mass transfer. If there is a (relatively) fast chemical reaction in the liquid phase, it is sometimes advantageous to disperse but not recirculate the gas bubbles, ensuring that they are in plug flow and can transfer mass more efficiently.

Rushton turbines have been traditionally used to disperse gases into liquids, but newer options, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine are becoming more prevalent. One of the issues is that as the gas flow increases, more and more of the gas accumulates in the low pressure zones behind the impeller blades, which reduces the power drawn by the mixer (and therefore its effectiveness). Newer designs, such as the GDX impeller, have nearly eliminated this problem.

==Gas–solid mixing==
Gas–solid mixing may be conducted to transport powders or small particulate solids from one place to another, or to mix gaseous reactants with solid catalyst particles. In either case, the turbulent eddies of the gas must provide enough force to suspend the solid particles, which otherwise sink under the force of gravity. The size and shape of the particles is an important consideration, since different particles have different drag coefficients, and particles made of different materials have different densities.
A common unit operation the process industry uses to separate gases and solids is the cyclone, which slows the gas and causes the particles to settle out.

==Multiphase mixing==
Multiphase mixing occurs when solids, liquids and gases are combined in one step. This may occur as part of a catalytic chemical process, in which liquid and gaseous reagents must be combined with a solid catalyst (such as hydrogenation); or in fermentation, where solid microbes and the gases they require must be well-distributed in a liquid medium. The type of mixer used depends upon the properties of the phases. In some cases, the mixing power is provided by the gas itself as it moves up through the liquid, entraining liquid with the bubble plume. This draws liquid upwards inside the plume, and causes liquid to fall outside the plume. If the viscosity of the liquid is too high to allow for this (or if the solid particles are too heavy), an impeller may be needed to keep the solid particles suspended.

== Basic nomenclature ==
For liquid mixing, the nomenclature is rather standardized:

* Impeller Diameter, &quot;D&quot; is measured for industrial mixers as the maximum diameter swept around the axis of rotation.
* Rotational Speed, &quot;N&quot; is usually measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) or revolutions per second (RPS). This variable refers to the rotational speed of the impeller as this number can differ along points of the drive train.
* Tank Diameter, &quot;T&quot; The inside diameter of a cylindrical vessel. Most mixing vessels receiving industrial mixers will be cylindrical.
* Power, &quot;P&quot; Is the energy input into a system usually by an electric motor or a pneumatic motor
* Impeller Pumping Capacity, &quot;Q&quot; The resulting fluid motion from impeller rotation.

==Constitutive equations==
Many of the equations used for determining the output of mixers are empirically derived, or contain empirically derived constants. Since mixers operate in the turbulent regime, many of the equations are approximations that are considered acceptable for most engineering purposes.

When a mixing impeller rotates in the fluid, it generates a combination of flow and shear. The impeller generated flow can be calculated with the following equation:

formula_1

Flow numbers for impellers have been published in the North American Mixing Forum sponsored Handbook of Industrial Mixing.

The power required to rotate an impeller can be calculated using the following equations:

formula_2 (Turbulent regime)

formula_3 (Laminar regime)

formula_4 is the (dimensionless) power number, which is a function of impeller geometry; formula_5 is the density of the fluid; formula_6 is the rotational speed, typically rotations per second; formula_7 is the diameter of the impeller; formula_8 is the laminar power constant; and formula_9 is the viscosity of the fluid. Note that the mixer power is strongly dependent upon the rotational speed and impeller diameter, and linearly dependent upon either the density or viscosity of the fluid, depending on which flow regime is present. In the transitional regime, flow near the impeller is turbulent and so the turbulent power equation is used.

The time required to blend a fluid to within 5% of the final concentration, formula_10, can be calculated with the following correlations:

formula_11 (Turbulent regime)

formula_12 (Transitional region)

formula_13 (Laminar regime)

The Transitional/Turbulent boundary occurs at formula_14

The Laminar/Transitional boundary occurs at formula_15

==Laboratory mixing==

At a laboratory scale, mixing is achieved by magnetic stirrers or by simple hand-shaking. Sometimes mixing in laboratory vessels is more thorough and occurs faster than is possible industrially. Magnetic stir bars are radial-flow mixers that induce solid body rotation in the fluid being mixed. This is acceptable on a small scale, since the vessels are small and mixing therefore occurs rapidly (short blend time). A variety of stir bar configurations exist, but because of the small size and (typically) low viscosity of the fluid, it is possible to use one configuration for nearly all mixing tasks. The cylindrical stir bar can be used for suspension of solids, as seen in iodometry, deagglomeration (useful for preparation of microbiology growth medium from powders), and liquid–liquid blending. Another peculiarity of laboratory mixing is that the mixer rests on the bottom of the vessel instead of being suspended near the center. Furthermore, the vessels used for laboratory mixing are typically more widely varied than those used for industrial mixing; for instance, Erlenmeyer flasks, or Florence flasks may be used in addition to the more cylindrical beaker.

== Mixing in microfluidics ==
When scaled down to the microscale, fluid mixing behaves radically different. This is typically at sizes from a couple (2 or 3) millimeters down to the nanometer range. At this size range normal advection does not happen unless it is forced by a hydraulic pressure gradient. Diffusion is the dominant mechanism whereby two different fluids come together. Diffusion is a relatively slow process. Hence a number of researchers had to devise ways to get the two fluids to mix. This involved Y junctions, T junctions, three-way intersections and designs where the interfacial area between the two fluids is maximized. Beyond just interfacing the two liquids people also made twisting channels to force the two fluids to mix. These included multilayered devices where the fluids would corkscrew, looped devices where the fluids would flow around obstructions and wavy devices where the channel would constrict and flare out. Additionally channels with features on the walls like notches or groves were tried.

One way to know if mixing is happening due to advection or diffusion is by finding the Peclet number. It is the ratio of advection to diffusion. At high Peclet numbers (&gt; 1), advection dominates. At low Peclet numbers (&lt; 1), diffusion dominates.

Peclet number = (flow velocity × mixing path) / diffusion coefficient

==Industrial mixing equipment==
At an industrial scale, efficient mixing can be difficult to achieve. A great deal of engineering effort goes into designing and improving mixing processes. Mixing at industrial scale is done in batches (dynamic mixing), inline or with help of static mixers. Moving mixers are powered with electric motors that operate at standard speeds of 1800 or 1500 RPM, which is typically much faster than necessary. Gearboxes are used to reduce speed and increase torque. Some applications require the use of multi-shaft mixers, in which a combination of mixer types are used to completely blend the product.

In addition to performing typical batch mixing operations, some mixing can be done continuously. Using a machine like the Continuous Processor, one or more dry ingredients and one or more liquid ingredients can be accurately and consistently metered into the machine and see a continuous, homogeneous mixture come out the discharge of the machine. Many industries have converted to continuous mixing for many reasons. Some of those are ease of cleaning, lower energy consumption, smaller footprint, versatility, control, and many others. Continuous mixers, such as the twin-screw Continuous Processor, also have the ability to handle very high viscosities.

===Turbines===
A selection of turbine geometries and power numbers are shown below.


Different types of impellers are used for different tasks; for instance, Rushton turbines are useful for dispersing gases into liquids, but are not very helpful for dispersing settled solids into liquid. Newer turbines have largely supplanted the Rushton turbine for gas–liquid mixing, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine. 
The power number is an empirical measure of the amount of torque needed to drive different impellers in the same fluid at constant power per unit volume; impellers with higher power numbers require more torque but operate at lower speed than impellers with lower power numbers, which operate at lower torque but higher speeds.

===Planetary mixer===
A &quot;planetary mixer&quot; is a device used to mix round products including adhesives, pharmaceuticals, foods (including dough), chemicals, solid rocket propellants, electronics, plastics and pigments. Planetary mixers are ideal for mixing and kneading viscous pastes (up to 6 million centipoise) under atmospheric or vacuum conditions. Capacities range from through . Many options including jacketing for heating or cooling, vacuum or pressure, vari speed drives, etc. are available. Planetary blades each rotate on their own axes, and at the same time on a common axis, thereby providing complete mixing in a very short timeframe.

Large industrial scale planetary mixers are used in the production of solid rocket fuel for long-range ballistic missiles. They are used to blend and homgenize the components of solid rocket propellant, ensuring a consistent and stable mixture of fuel &amp; oxidizer.

===ResonantAcoustic mixer===
ResonantAcoustic mixing (RAM) is able to mix, coat, mill, and sieve materials without impellers or blades touching the materials, yet typically 10X-100X faster than alternative technologies by generating a high level of energy (up to 100 g) through seeking and operating at the resonant condition of the mechanical system - at all times.

ResonantAcoustic mixers from lab scale to industrial production to continuous mixing are used for energetic materials like explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnic compositions, as well as pharmaceuticals, powder metallurgy, 3D printing, rechargeable battery materials, and battery recycling.

===Close-clearance mixers===
There are two main types of close-clearance mixers: anchors and helical ribbons. Anchor mixers induce solid-body rotation and do not promote vertical mixing, but helical ribbons do. Close clearance mixers are used in the laminar regime, because the viscosity of the fluid overwhelms the inertial forces of the flow and prevents the fluid leaving the impeller from entraining the fluid next to it. Helical ribbon mixers are typically rotated to push material at the wall downwards, which helps circulate the fluid and refresh the surface at the wall.

===High shear dispersers===

High shear dispersers create intense shear near the impeller but relatively little flow in the bulk of the vessel. Such devices typically resemble circular saw blades and are rotated at high speed. Because of their shape, they have a relatively low drag coefficient and therefore require comparatively little torque to spin at high speed. High shear dispersers are used for forming emulsions (or suspensions) of immiscible liquids and solid deagglomeration.

===Static mixers===

Static mixers are used when a mixing tank would be too large, too slow, or too expensive to use in a given process.

===Liquid whistles===

Liquid whistles are a kind of static mixer which pass fluid at high pressure through an orifice and subsequently over a blade. This subjects the fluid to high turbulent stresses and may result in mixing, emulsification, deagglomeration and disinfection.

Internal batch mixers such as the Banbury mixer are used for mixing or compounding rubber and plastics. The original design dates back to 1916. The mixer consists of two rotating spiral-shaped blades encased in segments of cylindrical housings. These intersect so as to leave a ridge between the blades. The blades may be cored for circulation of heating or cooling. Its invention resulted in major labor and capital savings in the tire industry, doing away with the initial step of roller-milling rubber. It is also used for reinforcing fillers in a resin system.

<text>[[Héctor Camacho]] vs. [[Edwin Rosario]], billed as Friday the 13th Resurrection, was a professional boxing match contested on June 13, 1986, for the WBC lightweight championship.

==Background==
Televised in the United States by HBO Boxing and in Puerto Rico by WAPA-TV (and to several other countries), the fight garnered wide media attention, especially in Puerto Rico: It was the fourth time that two Puerto Ricans battled for a world boxing title, and, at that time, it was also the world title fight that pitted the two boxers who hailed from the closest birth-places in boxing history (Camacho was born in Bayamón, while Rosario was from Toa Alta, a mere fifteen-minute car drive away from Bayamón). Sports reporter Rafael Bracero travelled to New York to make a documentary about the fighters and the fight, and even former BSN basketball star Fufi Santori, a self-declared not fan of boxing, got caught in the fight&#x27;s hype, making a prediction on television on the day of the fight. He predicted Camacho would win. Camacho was criticized by many Puerto Ricans because of the trunks he wore that day; he wore a Puerto Rican flag, but with the flag&#x27;s white star to his back. This was seen by many as an unpatriotic act, although Camacho had always proclaimed to be proud of being a Puerto Rican, and continued to proclaim so until he died in 2012.

The fight was for the WBC World Lightweight Title, earned by Camacho after his win over José Luis Ramírez, who had, in turn, beaten Rosario for the title.

===Undercard===
The undercard included a young Mike Tyson knocking out Reggie Gross in the first round and Julio César Chávez (who would later beat Camacho, Ramirez and Rosario) defending his WBC world Jr. Lightweight title with a seventh-round knockout of Refugio Rojas.

==The fight==
The first three rounds were swept by Camacho on all three judges&#x27; scorecards by keeping Rosario away with his jab and outcircling the pursuing challenger. In the fourth, Rosario began to turn things around by landing an uppercut in the final seconds, which earned him the round.

In round five, Rosario connected with a left to the chin as Camacho was getting ready to fire a right hand, and Camacho&#x27;s knees buckled. On the verge of falling, Camacho took his distance for the rest of the round, and Rosario continued on pursue, landing other damaging blows. 

Rounds six to ten were dominated by Camacho (out of a possible fifteen combined rounds, as three judges were scoring the fight, Rosario was given only one round between rounds six and ten by one judge).

In round eleven, Rosario hurt Camacho again, with a left hook through Camacho&#x27;s guard. Feeling he had a lead on the scorecards, Camacho again circled around the ring and grabbed, to avoid Rosario&#x27;s punches. Rosario continued landing in round twelve, also sweeping the round on all judges&#x27; cards.

Minutes later, Camacho was announced as winner and still WBC world Lightweight champion by a split decision (scores of 115–113 twice for Camacho, and 114–113 for Rosario). The fight&#x27;s result proved controversial, Puerto Ricans and other boxing fans who saw the fight have argued about the scoring ever since.

==Aftermath==
Days later, El Vocero newspaper reported of a murder related to the fight: apparently, a man had made a bet with another man, and after Rosario lost, the murder victim told his killer that he really didn&#x27;t have any money, causing the killer to get enraged and shoot him.

A rematch had been planned in 1997, but it never occurred.

On December 1, 1997, Rosario died of a pulmonary edema at age 34 while visiting his parents&#x27; house. For his part, Camacho died on November 24, 2012, at Bayamon, four days after being shot as part of a violent act where his friend was the apparent target.

Both Camacho and Rosario were later inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Rosario as a member of their 2006 class, and Camacho exactly 10 years later, as a member of their 2016 class.

<doc id="652828" wikidata="Q15980666" url="?curid=652828" title="New Alliance Party">
<text>The New Alliance Party (NAP) was an American political party formed in New York City in 1979. Its immediate precursor was an umbrella organization known as the Labor Community Alliance for Change, whose member groups included the Coalition of Grass Roots Women and the New York City Unemployed and Welfare Council. These groups were all associated with controversial psychologist and political activist Fred Newman, whose radical healthcare collectives, Centers for Change and Marxist International Workers Party, were active in grassroots politics in New York City.

The NAP&#x27;s first chairperson was then-South Bronx City Councilman Gilberto Gerena-Valentin, a veteran political activist from Puerto Rico. The party is notable for getting African-American psychologist Lenora Fulani on the ballot in all 50 states during her first presidential campaign in 1988, making her both the first African-American and woman to do so.

== History ==

=== Background and ideas ===
From 1974 to 1979, Fred Newman acquired some experience in politics managing the International Workers Party. The New Alliance Party was founded as an independent electoral party for the purpose of creating new alliances among groups marginalized by the American electoral process, namely people of color, the LGBT community, progressives, and women. The NAP described itself as &quot;pro-socialist&quot;.
The party supported the PLO and was antagonistic to the state of Israel; it also worked with Nation of Islam.

=== 1981 Dump Koch campaign ===
The New Alliance Party&#x27;s first impact on New York City politics was its participation in the early stages of the &quot;Dump Koch&quot; movement, which focused on then-Mayor Edward I. Koch, a former liberal Congressman who had moved steadily toward the right.

=== 1984 presidential election ===
During the 1984 presidential election, the NAP made its debut on the presidential campaign scene. Its candidate was Dennis L. Serrette, an African-American union activist who would later leave the NAP alleging questionable methods used by Newman and others. Serrette&#x27;s running mate was Nancy Ross, a NAP leader who had served on a community school board on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side.

In 1985, the NAP began an unusual political relationship with Jesse Jackson. While Newman was initially dismissive of Jackson, Fulani had praised the popular activist during his 1984 presidential run. After Jackson founded his Rainbow Coalition group, Newman and Fulani created the Rainbow Alliance, which lobbied for the benefit of small political parties. The Rainbow Alliance later changed its name to the Rainbow Lobby and expanded its scope to include opposing the US-backed dictatorships of Joseph Mobutu in Zaire and Prosper Avril in Haiti. When asked about his political relationship with Fulani in the press, Jackson claimed that there was no relationship at all. The Rainbow Lobby continued its lobbying activities into the early 1990s while Fulani repeatedly rebuked Jackson for his support of the Democratic Party.

=== 1988 presidential election ===
The 1988 presidential election was a major step for the NAP. The Fulani campaign ran under the slogan &quot;Two Roads are Better than One&quot;, supporting Jesse Jackson&#x27;s campaign within the Democratic Party while launching Fulani&#x27;s own run designed to challenge the African-American community to sever their historic relationship with the Democratic Party and embrace an independent path. In the previous election, the NAP was able to secure ballot spots in only 33 states. For the 1988 election, NAP pursued every avenue possible to gain ballot access, including attempts to gain the nomination of small independent parties which existed around the country, such as the Solidarity Party in Illinois. Fulani had six different running mates in different states, including Joyce Dattner and, in Oregon only, Harold Moore, each of whom represented &quot;different constituencies&quot;. When asked which one would become vice president if she won, Fulani answered: &quot;If elected, [they would] figure it out.&quot; Fulani&#x27;s vote total throughout the country was 217,221, or 0.2% of the vote, coming in fourth place. She was the second-most successful third-party presidential candidate that year, behind Libertarian Ron Paul. Also in the 1988 election, the NAP ran candidates for other offices, including US Senate candidates in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska. Though the party had its strongest roots in the east coast, the best result for the NAP was in Nebraska, where independent state senator Ernie Chambers received 1.6% of the vote.

In 1990, Fulani ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York. She was endorsed by Nation of Islam leader, minister Louis Farrakhan, who had been politically involved with Jesse Jackson&#x27;s 1988 campaign only to be dropped at the recommendation of Jackson&#x27;s campaign advisors. This was in the wake of Farrakhan being characterized in the press as antisemitic, as well as Jackson&#x27;s gaffe wherein he called New York City &quot;Hymietown&quot;. Fulani and Newman embraced Farrakhan, eliciting the anger of the Anti-Defamation League. In the wake of this criticism, Fulani moderated a historic conference on Black–Jewish relations, featuring the Jewish Marxist Newman conversing with African-American activist Reverend Al Sharpton.

=== 1992 presidential election ===
During the 1992 presidential election, Fulani again ran for president on the NAP ticket. Maria Elizabeth Muñoz, a Chicano activist, was chosen as her running mate. Muñoz had previously run for Senate and governor in California on Peace and Freedom Party tickets. Fulani lost the party&#x27;s nomination to Ron Daniels of Jesse Jackson&#x27;s Rainbow Coalition. Fulani also entered the New Hampshire primary for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 1992, gaining some press coverage for her frequent heckling of Bill Clinton&#x27;s campaign appearances after she was excluded from the New Hampshire Democratic debates. In 1992, the NAP also ran some candidates in other races, including US Senate candidates in Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, and New York. The best-performing NAP Senate presidential candidate was Mohammad T. Mehdi in New York, who came in fourth place with 0.8% of the vote.

=== Dissolution ===
By the mid-1990s, the NAP and its weekly newspaper &quot;The National Alliance&quot; had been disbanded. In 1994, Fulani and Newman joined the Patriot Party for a period, one of many groups which competed for control over Ross Perot&#x27;s Reform Party in the years to come. The same year, Fulani and former &quot;The National Alliance&quot; editor Jacqueline Salit formed the Committee for a Unified Independent Party, an organization dedicated to bringing various independent groups together to challenge the bipartisan nature of American politics. The Fulani and Newman operatives later became associated with the Independence Party of New York.

<text>The Livonians, or Livs, are a Balto-Finnic people indigenous to northern and northwestern Latvia. Livonians historically spoke Livonian, a Uralic language closely related to Estonian and Finnish. Initially, the last person to have learned and spoken Livonian as a mother tongue, Grizelda Kristiņa, died in 2013, making Livonian an extinct language. In 2020, it was reported that newborn Kuldi Medne had once again become the only living person who speaks Livonian as their first language. As of 2010, there were approximately 30 people who had learned it as a second language.

Historical, social and economic factors, together with an ethnically dispersed population, have resulted in the decline of Livonian identity, with only a small group surviving in the 21st century. In 2011, there were 250 people who claimed Livonian ethnicity in Latvia.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The exact date of migration of Livonians to the region has been disputed. &quot;The Livonians claim to have inhabited their present homeland for over 5,000 years.&quot; &quot;The Finnic tribes were pushed into the coastal regions by the Slav migrations of the sixth and seventh centuries AD.&quot;

=== The Middle Ages ===
Historically, the Livonians lived in two separate areas of Latvia, one group in Livonia and another on the northern coast of Courland. The latter were referred as Curonians, together with the Balts living there. The Livonians referred to themselves as &quot;rāndalist&quot; &#x27;coast dwellers&#x27; and supported themselves mainly by fishing, but also by agriculture and animal husbandry. Since they controlled an important trade route, the Daugava River (Livonian: &quot;Vēna&quot;), their culture was highly developed through trade with the Gotlanders, Russians and Finns, and, from the end of the first millennium AD onwards, with the Germans, Swedes and Danes.

However, with the traders came missionaries from Western Europe who wanted to convert the pagan Livonians to Christianity. One of the first people to convert some Livonians to Christianity was the Danish archbishop Absalon, who supposedly built a church in the Livonian village today known as Kolka. In the 12th century, Germans invaded Livonia and established a base in &quot;Uexküll&quot;, known today as Ikšķile. Archbishop Hartwig II converted some Livonians in the surrounding area, including the local chieftain Caupo of Turaida, who later allied himself with the Germans.

After Meinhard died in 1196, his place was taken by Berthold. Berthold tried to convert the Livonians by force, launching two raids on Livonia. The first took place in 1196, but he was forced to retreat to Germany after being ambushed near Salaspils. He tried again in 1198, but this time he was killed by the Livonian soldier Ymaut.

Berthold was followed by Albert von Buxhövden, who forced the Livonian leaders at the mouth of the Daugava River to give him land to build a Christian settlement. Building started in 1201. From this settlement, the city of Riga grew.

When this did not immediately induce the Livonians, Estonians, and Baltic peoples in the hinterland to convert, a knightly order was formed, the Knights of the Sword, primarily consisting of Germans, to bring salvation to the pagans by force. In a campaign that was part of the wars known as the Livonian Crusade, these knights defeated, subdued and converted the Livonians. In 1208, Pope Innocent III declared that all Livonians had been converted to Christianity. Afterwards they were obliged to join the Knights of the Sword as infantry during the wars against the Estonians and the Latvian tribes, which continued until 1217.

Before the German Conquests Livonian inhabited territory was divided in lands of Daugava Livonians, Satezele, Turaida, Idumeja, Metsepole.

During the Livonian Crusade, once prosperous Livonia was devastated, and whole regions were almost completely depopulated. This vacuum was filled by Latvian tribes – Curonians, Semigallians, Latgallians and Selonians – who started to move into the area around 1220, and continued to do so for at least thirty years. They settled mostly in the Daugava Valley, so that the Livonians of Livonia in the east were cut off from those living on the peninsula of Curonia in the west.

Because of their defeat at the battle of Saule the Knights of the Sword eventually had to look for support to the much more powerful Teutonic Order, which up until then had been active primarily in Poland and Lithuania. Having been reorganized as a subdivision of the Teutonic Order and renamed the Livonian Order in 1237, the former Knights of the Sword finally overpowered the Curonians in 1267, and subsequently the Semigallians in 1290. From then on most of Latvia remained under German control until the 16th century, with the city of Riga and several other cities existing as independent German-ruled bishoprics, and the Livonian Order ruling the rest of the land.

===Under foreign powers (1558–1795)===
In the middle of the 16th century, the Livonian Order and the independent bishoprics were in turmoil because of the growing influence of Martin Luther&#x27;s Reformation. Seeing a chance in the resulting military weakness of the Order, Czar Ivan the Terrible of Russia invaded Livonia in 1558, seeking access to the Baltic Sea. However, Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth entered the war as allies of the Livonian Order, resulting in almost a quarter of a century of war. The outcome of this Livonian War (1558–1582) was a Russian defeat, but also the dissolution of the Livonian Order. Livonia and south-eastern Latvia were claimed by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Curonia became an independent duchy (Courland), with Gotthard Kettler, the Livonian Order&#x27;s last Grandmaster, as its first duke.

After only ten years of peace, a new series of wars between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden, which had claimed Estonia after the Livonian War, ravaged Livonia from 1592. Eventually, the Swedes were victorious. In 1629, they could finally call Livonia and the city of Riga their own. Under the 17th Century Swedish Kings Gustav II Adolf and Charles XI, general elementary education was introduced, the Bible was translated in Estonian and Latvian, and a university was founded in Tartu in southern Estonia.

Although Sweden kept the Poles and the Danes at a distance, this could not be said of the Russians. In the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Czar Peter the Great utterly destroyed Sweden&#x27;s pretensions to being a regional superpower. In the 1721 Treaty of Nystad, Estonia and Livonia, which had again been completely devastated after more than twenty years of war, were claimed by Russia. Curonia continued to be ruled by its dukes for another three-quarters of a century, but in 1795, that region also became a Russian possession as part of the Third Partition of Poland.

===Assimilation and isolation (1795–1914)===

Partly because of the recurring devastation of war and the resultant mingling of refugees, the Livonians of Livonia were eventually completely assimilated by the Latvians. The last remnant of this once vibrant nation was made up of several families living along the river Salaca (Livonian: &quot;Salatsi&quot;), but in the second half of the 19th century, the Livonian language and culture completely disappeared from the region known to this day as Livonia; the last known speaker of the eastern Livonian dialect died in 1864, though according to some reports, there were still some people in the early 20th century in the Polish area In the Latvian dialect spoken in Livonia, a large number of Livonian loanwords have survived, and other traces of Livonian can be found in many geographical names in the region.

In Curonia, the Livonian language and culture also came under heavy pressure, but here it retained a last foothold on the outermost tip of the Curonian Peninsula. Several factors made sure that in this area, known as &quot;Līvõd rānda&quot;, the Livonian Coast, Latvian culture was too weak to assimilate the Livonians. For one thing, the society of the Livonians living in this area was exclusively sea-oriented and based on fishing, while that of the Latvians in the interior was exclusively land-oriented and mostly agricultural. This meant there was not a lot of interaction between the two groups. Also, the Livonian Coast was separated from the interior of Curonia by dense forests and impassable marshlands, which made regular interaction even less likely. The people of the Livonian Coast had much closer ties to the inhabitants of the Estonian island of Saaremaa, across the Gulf of Riga to the north. In their isolated fishing villages, these Livonians kept to themselves for centuries. It was not until the 20th century that the outside world intruded on their quiet existence.

At the beginning of 20th century many local Livs converted to the Russian Orthodox faith. A new Russian Orthodox church was built in Kolka along with a grammar school nearby and navy school in Mazirbe. Many graduates in later years became sea captains first in the Russian Empire, and later in independent Latvia.

===World War I===
In 1914, Russia entered the First World War by attacking the Germans and the Austrians from the east, but soon it was pushed back in a series of devastating German victories, which eventually left almost the entire Baltic region in German hands. The Livonian Coast was occupied by the Germans in 1915. At their approach, many Livonians fled their homes, often never to return. Their main destinations were Estonia and inner parts of Latvia. The rest of the people were driven from their homes by the Germans and had to wait until 1919 before they were allowed to return.

The Russian defeat and the subsequent abdication of Czar Nicholas II opened the door for Vladimir Lenin and the communists to make a grab for power in Russia, leading to the establishment of the Soviet government in Russia in 1917. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the following year ended the war between Germany and Soviet Russia and left the Baltic region firmly in German hands. However, after the German capitulation in 1919, the Baltic peoples rose up and established the independent republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

===The interwar years===

The Livonian Coast became part of independent Latvia. Actions by the Latvian government during the interwar years towards supporting the Livonian minority has been seen as lacking or non-existent, with claims that the Latvian government did not see the topic of Livonian culture as important enough. Nevertheless, the Livonian language and culture experienced a revival between the two World Wars (beginning with the term of the Latvian president Jānis Čakste through the term of the last interwar president Kārlis Ulmanis). The clearest expression of this revival was the establishment on April 2, 1923 of the Livonian Society (, ), which considered itself the representative of the Livonian people. Also, a Livonian language choir was founded and Livonian song festivals were held along the entire Livonian Coast. Furthermore, a Livonian flag was adopted, with the colours green (for the forests), white (for the beaches) and blue (for the sea), and a division similar to the Latvian flag (three horizontal bars with the middle one-half as wide as the outer ones).

In 1923, the Latvian government prohibited the formation of an ethnic Livonian parish within the Lutheran Church. It did approve the introduction of the Livonian language as an optional subject in elementary schools in the villages of the Livonian Coast that same year. In the 1930s, the first Livonian language reader, poetry collections of several Livonian writers, and a monthly magazine in the Livonian language, called &quot;Līvli&quot; (&quot;The Livonian&quot;) were published. Also, contact was made with related peoples such as the Estonians and the Finns — spurred by the Finnish promotion of closer ties with the kindred Baltic Finns — and in 1939, the Livonian Community Centre in Mazirbe () was founded with subsidies from the Estonian and Finnish governments.

This cultural revival of the Interbellum years served to give the Livonian people for the first time a clear consciousness of their ethnic identity. Before, they had always referred to themselves as &quot;rāndalist&quot; (&quot;coast dwellers&quot;) or &quot;kalāmīed&quot; (&quot;fishermen&quot;). From the 1920s and 1930s on, though, they began to call themselves &quot;līvõd&quot;, &quot;līvnikad&quot;, or &quot;līvlist&quot; (&quot;Livonians&quot;).

===The Second World War===
In 1940, Latvia, like Estonia and Lithuania, was occupied by the Soviet Union. This occupation and the subsequent German invasion of 1941 ended all progress the Livonians had made in the preceding twenty years. All cultural expressions were prohibited and just like twenty years before, the inhabitants of the Livonian Coast were driven from their homes. Most of them spent the war years in Riga or western Latvia, but some fled across the Baltic Sea to Gotland. The Curonian Peninsula was one of the areas where the Germans held out until the general capitulation of May 9, 1945, which meant that often there was not a house left standing when the Livonians returned home after the war.

===Repression by the Soviet Union===
In the Soviet era, the Livonians were hard-hit by repressive measures from Moscow. For one thing, they were not allowed to sail far enough from shore to continue their fishery. For another, like the Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians, large numbers of them were deported to Siberia between 1945 and 1952, with a clear peak in 1949, when agriculture was collectivized in the Baltic states. Also, in 1955 a Soviet military base was constructed in the middle of the Livonian Coast. To accomplish this, some Livonians were forcibly relocated to villages farther from the coast. Subsequently, the western villages of the Livonian Coast had to be almost completely evacuated when the Soviet Union made its Baltic coastline (its western border) a &quot;closed border area&quot; of the Iron Curtain where no one was allowed to live.

Livonian culture was repressed during the Soviet period. For example, the Livonian Society was banned and the Livonian Community Centre expropriated and given to others. Within the Latvian SSR, the Livonians were not recognized as a separate ethnic group.

===Modern situation===

It was not until early the early 1970s that Livonian singers were allowed to found a choir named &quot;Līvlist&quot; (&quot;The Livonians&quot;) in the western Latvian city of Ventspils. The 1980s, Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of glasnost and perestroika opened the Iron Curtain, bringing change. In 1986, the Livonian Cultural Society was founded. It was later renamed the Livonian Union (Livonian: &quot;Līvõd Īt&quot;).

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia became once again an independent country. In this new nation, Livonians were finally recognised as an indigenous ethnic minority, whose language and culture must be protected and advanced. All rights and possessions which had been taken away from them during the Soviet era were now returned to them. For example, the old Livonian Community Centre in Mazirbe (Irē) was given back and transformed into a historical museum, called the House of the Livonian People. Also, the Livonian language was reintroduced in the elementary schools in Riga, Staicele, Ventspils, Dundaga and Kolka. The first research body dedicated to Livonian studies, the Livonian Institute at the University of Latvia was established in 2018.

Furthermore, on February 4, 1992, the Latvian government created a cultural historic protected territory called &quot;Līvõd rānda&quot; – the Livonian Coast – which included all twelve of the Livonian villages: Lūžņa (Livonian: Lūž), Miķeļtornis (Pizā), Lielirbe (Īra), Jaunciems (Ūžkilā), Sīkrags (Sīkrõg), Mazirbe (Irē), Košrags (Kuoštrõg), Pitrags (Pitrõg), Saunags (Sǟnag), Vaide (Vaid), Kolka (Kūolka), and Melnsils (Mustānum). The Latvian government discourages settlement of ethnic Latvians and other non-Livonians in this area and prohibits alterations to historic village sites. Also, it is prohibited for anyone to start a hotel, restaurant, or other public establishment which might adversely influence the Livonian culture or draw outsiders into the area.

Today, many Latvians claim to have some Livonian ancestry. However, there are only 176 people in Latvia who identify themselves as Livonian. According to data from 1995, the Livonian language was spoken by no more than 30 people, of whom only nine were native speakers. An article published by the Foundation for Endangered Languages in 2007 stated that there were only 182 registered Livonians and a mere six native speakers. &quot;The last Livonian&quot;, who had learned the Livonian language as a part of an unbroken chain of Livonian generations, was Viktors Bertholds (b. 1921). He was buried on 28 February 2009 in the Livonian village of Kolka in Courland.

The Livonian Dāvis Stalts was elected into the Latvian parliament, the Saeima in 2011. In 2018, after being re-elected to the Saeima, Janīna Kursīte-Pakule delivered her oath in Livonian before being asked to retake it in Latvian, which she did in the Livonian dialect of Latvian. In 2018, the Livonian Institute at the University of Latvia () was established to promote research and awareness of the language. It is led by linguist and activist Valts Ernštreits.

In 2020, it was reported that newborn Kuldi Medne had become the only living person who speaks Livonian as their first language. Her parents are Livonian language revival activists Jānis Mednis and Renāte Medne. In October 2022, they published &quot;Kūldaläpš. Zeltabērns&quot; (&#x27;Golden Child&#x27;), a book in Livonian and Latvian for children and parents, with plans for subsequent books and an audio version. Currently, the Livonian language is being revived, with some 210 persons having some knowledge of the language at a A1 or A2 level.

2023 was proclaimed as Livonian Heritage Year by the UoL Livonian Institute in cooperation with the UNESCO Latvian National Commission and the Latvian National Cultural Center, with various events held by individuals and institutions. In 2023, the first of 171 approved road signs in Latvia with Latvian and Livonian text were placed on the border of Talsi Municipality. During the 2023 Latvian Song and Dance Festival, for the first time in the history of the event, a song with Livonan lyrics was featured.

<doc id="652840" wikidata="Q2034398" url="?curid=652840" title="Osmeterium">
<text>The osmeterium is a defensive organ found in all papilionid larvae, in all stages. The organ is situated in the prothoracic segment and can be everted when the larva feels threatened. The everted organ resembles a fleshy forked tongue (not unlike a snake tongue), and this along with the large eye-like spots on the body might be used to startle birds and small reptiles. The osmeterial organ remains inside the body in the thoracic region in an inverted position and is everted when the larva is disturbed in any way emitting a foul, disagreeable odor which serves to repel ants, small spiders and mantids. To humans, this odour is rather strong but not unpleasant, usually smelling like a concentrated scent of the caterpillar&#x27;s food plant and pineapple.

The constitution of the osmeterial secretion varies from species to species and contains monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenic compounds or a mixture of aliphatic acids and esters.

The fine structure of the osmeterium of &quot;Papilio demoleus libanius&quot; Fruhstorfer has been studied and found to contain 3 types of specialised cells for synthesis, acid secretion, and storage of the osmeterial secretion.

==Structure==
The fine structure of the osmeterium gland of &quot;Papilio&quot; larvae consists of the following cell types.
*Ellipsoid gland cells have an extensively infolded basal plasma membrane, abundant ribosomes and whorls of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The apical plasma membrane bears long microvilli extending into a mass of granular material containing electron-lucid cavities. Tangential slits occur in the epicuticle. These cells are presumed to be organic acid-secreting cells.
*Tubular arm cells contain heterogeneous, electron-dense inclusions, extensively-branched nuclei and large mitochondria, sometimes distended with electron-dense material. The apical plasma membrane bears short microvilli. The inner, dense epicuticle forms a complex ramifying system. These glandular cells presumably synthesize and secrete the mature secretion.
Specific study of &quot;Papilio demoleus libanius&quot; Fruhstorfer shows the possible existence of a third type of cell
*Slack cells, loosely surround the ellipsoid gland cells. These cells possess papillae, well-developed, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and numerous secretory vacuoles of various sizes and electron density. They may function as storage cells.

==Osmeterial secretion==
The osmetrial secretion consists of a mixture of volatile organic acids, such as isobutyric acid and 2-methylbutyric acid.

The secretion of &quot;Papilio demodocus&quot; pre-final larval instar contains methyl 3-hydroxybutanoate, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, α-pinene, myrcene, limonene, β-phellandrene, (&quot;Z&quot;)-ocimene, (&quot;E&quot;)-ocimene, β-caryophyllene, (&quot;E&quot;)-β-farnesene, and germacrene A, as well as a number of unidentified sesquiterpenoids. and that of its final instar contains 2-methylpropanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, and their methyl and ethyl esters as major constituents.

Volatile components of the secretion of &quot;Parnassius glacialis&quot; (Parnassiinae, Parnassiini) consisted of isobutyric acid, 2-methylbutyric acid, and their methyl esters. That of &quot;Sericinus montela&quot; (Parnassiinae, Zerynthiini) was characterized as monoterpene hydrocarbons comprising β-myrcene (major), α-pinene, sabinene, limonene, and β-phellandrene, and of &quot;Pachliopta aristolochiae&quot; (Papilioninae, Troidini) was composed of numerous sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, including α-himachalene, α-amorphene, and germacrene A, and a few oxygenated sesquiterpenoids.

Studies on osmeterial secretion makes it possible to classify the Papilionid species into two large categories on the basis of the chemical property of osmeterial secretion.
*One is a group in which the chemical constitution of osmeterial secretion of the last larval instar markedly differs in quality from those of the younger larvae. The results derived from &quot;Papilio protenor&quot;, &quot;P. demodocus&quot; and other &quot;Papilio&quot; species (&quot;P. helenus&quot;, &quot;P. machaon&quot;, &quot;P. memnon&quot;, &quot;P. bianor&quot;, &quot;P. maccki&quot;, &quot;P. xuthus&quot;, etc., unpublished work) may assign the genus &quot;Papilio&quot; (tribe Papilionini) to this group, which can be termed &#x27;heterogeneous type&#x27;. 
*The genera &quot;Luehdorfia&quot; (tribe Zerynthiini), &quot;Graphium&quot; (tribe Graphiini) and &quot;Atrophaneura&quot; (tribe Troidini) apparently belong to the other group, in which no qualitative change of osmeterial secretion occurs at the last larval ecdysis. This group can be designated as &#x27;homogeneous type&#x27;, which is further subdivisible into three types.
**Monoterpene - &quot;Luehdorfia&quot; (Zerynthiini, Parnassiinae)
**Sesquiterpene - &quot;Atrophaneura&quot; (Troidini, Papilionnae)

<doc id="652845" wikidata="Q8006847" url="?curid=652845" title="William Clarke (English politician)">
<text>Sir William Clarke (died 1666) was an English politician. Born about 1623 in London of obscure parentage, he was admitted as a student to Inner Temple in 1645 and called to the bar in 1653. On 28 January 1661 he was appointed Secretary at War, after having served for at least the previous twelve years as secretary to General Monck. Clarke served as Secretary to the Council of the Army, 1647–1649, and Secretary to General Monck and the Commanders of the Army in Scotland, 1651-1660. Clarke served as the Secretary at War from 1661 to his death in 1666, as a casualty of war with the Dutch. With the Restoration, both Monck and Clarke had great favour with Charles II, who bestowed knighthood upon Clarke and gave him the use, for a term of some years, of the great lodge and 60 acres within Marylebone Park. His widow was Dorothy Clarke, and they had one son, George Clarke.

==Circumstances related to Clarke&#x27;s death==
In November 1652 Monck became a general at sea in the First Anglo-Dutch War, which was concluded with an English victory in the Battle of Scheveningen in August 1653, although a peace treaty was not signed for another eight months. The Commonwealth government of Oliver Cromwell tried to avoid further conflict with the Dutch Republic, but the Treaty of Westminster planted the seeds of future conflict.

The Restoration government of Charles II negotiated a new treaty with the Dutch Republic in 1661, concluding the treaty by 1662. By 1664, however, English ships had begun provoking Dutch ships, and the English invaded the Dutch colony of New Netherland in North America on 24 June 1664, and had control of it by October. This Second Anglo-Dutch War was to cost Clarke his life. In the winter of 1666 the Dutch created a strong anti-English alliance. On 26 January, Louis declared war. In February Frederick III of Denmark did the same after having received a large sum. By the spring of 1666, the Dutch had rebuilt their fleet with much heavier ships — thirty of them possessing more cannon than any Dutch ship in early 1665 — and threatened to join with the French.

The result was the Four Days&#x27; Battle, one of the longest naval engagements in history. Despite administrative and logistic difficulties, a fleet of eighty ships under General-at-Sea Monck, the Commonwealth veteran, (after the Duke of Albemarle) set sail at the end of May 1666. In his official capacity Clarke attended Monck aboard the &quot;Royal Charles&quot;. The Four Days&#x27; Battle began on June 1. On the 2nd day, Clarke&#x27;s right leg was shattered by a cannonball. Monck reported that &quot;he bore it bravely&quot; but, two days later, Clarke died. His body was buried at Harwich.

==The Clarke Papers==
The Clarke Papers are Sir William&#x27;s working papers for 1623/24 to 1666, bequeathed by George Clarke, Sir William&#x27;s son, to Worcester College, Oxford. These papers, an important primary source for the English Civil War and the Interregnum, were first brought to wide public attention by the historian Charles Harding Firth. He edited and published a four volume selection entitled &quot;The Clarke Papers&quot; (1891–1901). The papers themselves are 51 bound volumes with a large amount of unbound material. In 2005, the historian Frances Henderson published a new selection of Clarke&#x27;s working papers taken from the large collection of his writings in shorthand.
