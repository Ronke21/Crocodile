<text>Gary Lawrence Francione (born May 1954) is an American academic in the fields of law and philosophy. He is Board of Governors Professor of Law and Katzenbach Scholar of Law and Philosophy at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He is also a visiting professor of philosophy at the University of Lincoln (UK) and honorary professor of philosophy at the University of East Anglia (UK). He is the author of numerous books and articles on animal ethics.

== Biography ==
Francione graduated with a BA in philosophy from the University of Rochester, where he was awarded the Phi Beta Kappa O&#x27;Hearn Scholarship, allowing him to pursue graduate study in philosophy in the UK. He received his MA in philosophy and his JD from the University of Virginia, where he was articles editor of the &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot;. After graduation, he clerked for Judge Albert Tate, Jr., U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and for Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor of the U.S. Supreme Court.

After practicing law at the New York firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, he joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1984, and received tenure in 1987. He began to teach animal rights theory as part of his course in jurisprudence in 1985. In 1989, he joined the Rutgers faculty, and in 1990, he and his colleague Anna E. Charlton started the Rutgers Animal Rights Law Project, in which law students were awarded academic credit for working on actual cases involving animals. Francione and Charlton closed the clinic in 2000, but continue to teach courses in animal rights theory, animals and the law, and human rights and animal rights. Francione also teaches criminal law, criminal procedure, and legal philosophy. In 1989, Francione taught the first course in an American law school on animal rights and the law.

Francione has been a professor at Rutgers since at least 1995, when &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Rutgers&#x27; Animal Rights Law Center, the only one in the United States, was receiving 200 calls a week, and that Francione was losing &quot;well over half the lawsuits the clinic brings&quot;, as they were taking a strict abolitionist approach.

== Animal rights theory ==
Francione is known for his work on animal rights theory, and in 1989, was the first academic to teach it in an American law school. His work has focused on three issues: the property status of animals, the differences between animal rights and animal welfare, and a theory of animal rights based on sentience alone, rather than on any other cognitive characteristics.

He is a pioneer of the abolitionist theory of animal rights, arguing that animal welfare regulation is theoretically and practically unsound, serving only to prolong the status of animals as property by making the public feel comfortable about using them. He argues that non-human animals require only one right, the right not to be regarded as property, and that veganism—the rejection of the use of animals as mere resources—is the moral baseline of the animal rights movement. He rejects all forms of violence, arguing that the animal rights movement is the logical progression of the peace movement, seeking to take it one step further by ending conflict between human and non-human animals, and by treating animals as ends in themselves.

* For the right not to be regarded as property, see Francione, Gary. &quot;Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement&quot;, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francione is the author or co-author of several books about animal rights, including &quot;Animals, Property, and the Law&quot; (1995), &quot;Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement&quot; (1996), &quot;Animals as Persons&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition or Regulation?&quot; (2010, with Robert Garner). &quot;He has also written in the areas of copyright, patent law, and law and science&quot;.

=== Property status of animals ===
In &quot;Animals, Property, and the Law&quot; (1995), Francione argues that because animals are the property of humans, laws that supposedly require their &quot;humane&quot; treatment and prohibit the infliction of &quot;unnecessary&quot; harm do not provide a significant level of protection for animal interests. For the most part, these laws and regulations require only that animals receive that level of protection that is required for their use as human property. Animals only have value as commodities and their interests do not matter in any moral sense. As a result, despite having laws that supposedly protect them, Francione contends that we treat animals in ways that would be regarded as torture if humans were the ones being used. He argues that we could choose to provide some greater measure of protection to animals even if they were to remain our property, but only up until the point where it becomes too costly for us to continue. Legal, social, and economic forces militate strongly against recognizing animal interests unless there is an economic benefit to humans.

=== Comparison of animal rights and animal welfare ===

In &quot;Rain Without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement&quot; (1996), Francione argues that there are significant theoretical and practical differences between animal rights, which he maintains requires the abolition of animal exploitation, and animal welfare, which seeks to regulate exploitation to make it more humane. Francione contends that the theoretical difference between these two approaches is obvious. The abolitionist position is that we cannot justify our use of nonhumans however &quot;humanely&quot; we treat animals; the regulationist position is that animal use is justifiable and that only issues of treatment are relevant.

Francione describes as &quot;new welfarists&quot; those who claim to support animal rights, but who support animal welfare regulation as the primary way to achieve incremental recognition of the inherent value of nonhumans. He argues that there is no factual support for this position because not only do regulations seldom if ever go beyond treating animals as economic commodities with only extrinsic value, but the perception that regulation has improved the &quot;humane&quot; treatment of animals may very well facilitate continued and increased exploitation by making the public feel more comfortable about its consumption of animal products.

A central tenet of Francione&#x27;s philosophy is that the most important form of incremental change within the abolitionist framework is veganism. Francione has also long argued that the animal rights movement is the logical extension of the peace movement and should embrace a non-violent approach. He maintains that an abolitionist/vegan movement is truly radical and that violence is reactionary.

=== Relevance of sentience ===
In his &quot;Introduction to Animal Rights: Your Child or the Dog?&quot; (2000), Francione argues that a theory of abolition should not require that animals have any cognitive characteristic beyond sentience to be full members of the moral community, entitled to the basic, pre-legal right not to be the property of humans. He rejects the position that animals have to have humanlike cognitive characteristics, such as reflective self-awareness, language ability, or preference autonomy in order to have the right not to be used by humans as resources. Francione derives this right from the principle of equal consideration in that he maintains that if animals are property, their interests can never receive equal consideration.

As part of this discussion, Francione identifies what he calls our &quot;moral schizophrenia&quot; when it comes to nonhumans. On the one hand, we say that we take animal interests seriously. Francione points to the fact that many of us even live with nonhuman companions whom we regard as members of our families and whose personhood—their status as beings with intrinsic moral value—we do not doubt for a second. On the other hand, because animals are property, they remain things that have no value other than what we choose to accord them and whose interests we protect only when it provides a benefit—usually economic—to do so. According to Francione, if animals are going to matter morally and not be things, we cannot treat them as property. Francione debated the sentience of plants with Michael Marder in a debate organized by Columbia University Press.

=== Animal rights movement ===
Francione opposes violence in the struggle for animal rights. He has been criticized for this stance by Steven Best, who refers to those in the movement who reject violence as &quot;Franciombes&quot; and supports more permissive attitudes towards property damage and violence.

== Personal life ==
His wife, Anna E. Charlton, is an adjunct professor of law at Rutgers University, is active in the same field, and has co-authored several publications with Francione. In 2015, Gary Francione was involved in a multimillion-dollar tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). , he lives with six dogs, calling them &quot;non-human refugees&quot; who share his home—four suffered cruelty at the hands of past owners.

<text>Warren Demian Manshel (January 6, 1924 – February 25, 1990) was an investment banker; an editor and publisher; and a diplomat.

== Early life, education and career ==

Warren Manshel was born in France and immigrated to the United States from Germany with his family prior to World War II. He enlisted in and served in the U.S. Army during World War II, ultimately licensing several Allied-influenced newspapers and a new German news agency. Following World War II, Manshel enrolled at Harvard University, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in government. As a teaching fellow at Harvard, he shared an office and friendship with Henry Kissinger, later to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as U.S. Secretary of State. Upon earning his doctorate, Manshel was awarded Harvard&#x27;s prestigious 1952 Chase Prize in International Relations for the &quot;most publishable document advancing peace&quot; for his preemptive, scholarly work on the unification of post-war Europe.

Shortly after Harvard, Manshel became director and chief administrative officer at the Council for Cultural Freedom, an anti-Communist organization of American and European intellectuals (1954-1955). He then joined Coleman &amp; Company in New York in 1955, eventually becoming its managing partner and director of institutional research; and retired from the firm in 1977. An expert investment banker, Manshel also co-founded the European Options Exchange in Belgium in 1978, now a unit of Euronext. He also was a member of the Board of Overseers at Harvard University. Following his diplomatic service in 1981, Manshel served as a member of the board of directors for a Dreyfus Funds company.

== &quot;The Public Interest&quot; and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazines ==

Manshel, a neo-liberal, continued to cultivate his influential role as a social, political and international relations intellectual throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1965, he co-founded and published &quot;The Public Interest&quot; magazine with Irving Kristol. During Warren Manshel&#x27;s tenure as its publisher, &quot;The Public Interest&quot; gave voice to leading and emerging intellectuals, including Seymour Martin Lipset, Peter Drucker, Leon Kass, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Francis Fukuyama.

In 1970, Manshel launched the influential &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine with his friend Samuel P. Huntington, later the author of &quot;Clash of the Civilizations&quot;, and in conjunction with Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Manshel hired Richard Holbrooke as the first managing editor for &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; - later to become a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, U.S. Ambassador to Germany, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, peace negotiator for the Dayton Accords, and U.S. Presidential Envoy to the Middle East. Manshel served as editor and publisher of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; until his death in 1990. Under his direction, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; gave voice to intellectuals in academia, finance, politics and government. Foreign Policy is now owned by The Slate Group, a business unit of The Washington Post Company.

== Political advisor, diplomat ==

A member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and an expert in social, economic and political affairs, and international relations, Manshel was tapped to serve as confidante to prominent national political figures in the United States including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY); Senator and presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy (D-MN); Senator and presidential candidate Frank Church (D-ID); and Vice President and Democratic Nominee for President Walter Mondale (D-MN). In recognition of his body of work, President Jimmy Carter appointed Warren Demian Manshel as U.S. Ambassador to Denmark, a position he held with distinction from 1978 to 1981.

== Manshel Lecture on American Foreign Policy, Harvard University ==

To underscore the importance that Ambassador Warren Demian Manshel and his wife and partner Anita Coleman placed on social and political justice, and international relations, friends and family endowed the Warren and Anita Manshel Lecture on American Foreign Policy at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs (WCFIA) at Harvard University. To date, Manshel Lecturer and honorees have included:

* Irving Kristol, co-founder, &quot;The Public Interest&quot;, &quot;The National Interest&quot;
* Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-New York)
* Anthony Lake, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs

<doc id="633586" wikidata="Q262461" url="?curid=633586" title="Ingrid Newkirk">
<text>Ingrid Elizabeth Newkirk (née Ward; born June 11, 1949) is a British-American animal activist, author and the president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the world&#x27;s largest animal rights organization.

Newkirk founded PETA in March 1980 with fellow animal rights activist Alex Pacheco. They came to public attention in 1981, during what became known as the Silver Spring monkeys case, when Pacheco photographed 17 macaque monkeys being experimented on inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal research laboratory and to an amendment in 1985 to the Animal Welfare Act. Since then, Newkirk has led campaigns to stop the use of animals in crash tests, convinced companies to stop testing cosmetics on animals, organized undercover investigations that have led to government sanctions against companies, universities, and entertainers who use animals.

Newkirk has been criticized for her support of actions carried out in the name of the Animal Liberation Front. Newkirk and PETA have also been criticized for euthanizing many of the animals taken into PETA&#x27;s shelters, including healthy pets, and opposition to the whole notion of pets, and her position that &quot;There&#x27;s no rational basis for saying that a human being has special rights. A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy,&quot; as well as seemingly seeing eradication as a goal. PETA has responded to this line of criticism.

Born in Kingston upon Thames, England, in 1949, Newkirk was the only child of Noel Oswald Wodehouse Ward (1917–2000) and Mary Patricia Ward (&quot;née&quot; Dudley, 1921–2013). Newkirk spent her early years in the Orkney Islands, Scotland and in Ware, Hertfordshire. Her father was a navigational engineer, and when she was seven, the family moved to New Delhi, India, where her father worked for the government, while her mother volunteered for Mother Teresa in a leper colony and a home for unwed mothers. Newkirk attended a convent boarding school in the Himalayas for well-to-do Indian nationals and non-natives. &quot;It was the done thing for a British girl in India&quot;, she told Michael Specter for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;But I was the only British girl in this school. I was hit constantly by nuns, starved by nuns. The whole God thing was shoved right down my throat.&quot;

Newkirk helped her mother out in the leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, stuffing toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother&#x27;s advice that it does not matter who suffers, but how. She tells the story of an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, when she heard laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog&#x27;s legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, laughing as they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, and tried to get him to drink some water, but someone had packed his throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that it was a turning point. She later attended Ware Grammar School, which was established for members of the Church of England.

When she was eighteen, the family moved to Florida, where her father worked on designing bombing systems for the United States Air Force. It was there that she met her husband, Steve Newkirk; the couple married in 1968 and divorced in 1980. He introduced her to Formula One racing, which—along with sumo wrestling—remains one of her great passions, according to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s sex. The first time you hear them rev their engines, my God! That noise goes straight up my spine.&quot;

===Introduction to animal protection===
Until she was 21, Newkirk had given no thought to animals rights or even vegetarianism. In 1970, she and her husband moved to Poolesville, Maryland, where she studied to become a stockbroker. A neighbor abandoned some kittens, and Newkirk decided to take them to an animal shelter. She told Specter:

Newkirk took a job in the kennels, witnessing the mistreatment of the animals, including physical abuse. Kathy Snow Guillermo writes that Newkirk disinfected kennels by day, and by night studied animal care, animal behavior, and animal-cruelty investigations.

She blew the whistle on the shelter and became an animal-protection officer, first for Montgomery County, Maryland, then for the District of Columbia. She became D.C.&#x27;s first female poundmaster, persuading the city to fund veterinary services and to set up an adoption program, an investigations department, and a pet sterilization program. By 1976, she was head of the animal-disease-control division of the District of Columbia Commission on Public Health.

==Newkirk&#x27;s work with PETA==
===Founding of PETA===
In 1980, Newkirk met Alex Pacheco in a D.C. shelter where he was working as a volunteer. It was Pacheco who introduced Newkirk to the concept of animal rights. Pacheco presented her with a copy of Peter Singer&#x27;s &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; (1975). She has said that Singer had put into words what she had felt intuitively for a long time, and she called Pacheco &quot;Alex the Abdul&quot;, a name given to messengers in Islamic stories.

The concept of animal rights was at that time almost unheard of in the U.S. The modern animal rights movement had started in England eight years earlier, in 1972, when a group of Oxford University scholars, particularly philosophers, had formed the &quot;Oxford group&quot; to promote the idea that discrimination against individuals on the basis of their species is as irrational as discrimination on the basis of race or sex. In March 1980, Newkirk and Pacheco decided to form a group to educate the American public about these ideas, at first consisting of what Newkirk called &quot;five people in a basement&quot;. The couple also fell in love and began living together, although they were very different. Newkirk was older, practical, and very organized, whereas Pacheco spent his time in white painter&#x27;s overalls eating vegetarian hot dogs straight from the can.

===Silver Spring monkeys===
The case of the Silver Spring monkeys, an animal-research controversy that lasted ten years, transformed PETA from just Newkirk, Pacheco, and a small group of friends into an international movement.

In mid-1981, Pacheco took a job as a volunteer inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, so that he and Newkirk would have some firsthand knowledge on which to base their campaigns. Edward Taub, a psychologist, was working there on 17 monkeys. He had cut sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to their arms and legs, then used physical restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food to force them to use the limbs. The idea was to see whether monkeys could be induced to use limbs they could not feel.

Pacheco repeatedly went into the lab at night to take photographs and to escort scientists, including veterinarians and a primatologist, through it to secure their testimony. Newkirk lay crouched on the back seat of a car outside, hidden under a large cardboard box with holes for her eyes, using a walkie-talkie from a toy store to alert Pacheco if anyone else entered the building. The monkeys&#x27; living conditions documented by Pacheco were graphically disturbing. Having collected the evidence, Newkirk and Pacheco alerted the police, who raided the lab, removed the monkeys, and charged Taub with 113 counts of cruelty to animals and six counts of failing to provide adequate veterinary care. Taub maintained that he had been set up by Newkirk and Pacheco while he was on vacation and that several of the photographs had been staged. The judge found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care and fined him $3,000. A later jury trial saw five of these counts dismissed, and the sixth was overturned on appeal because of a technicality. The National Institutes of Health, which had funded Taub&#x27;s research, was among the scientists and other professionals who criticized the conditions in which Taub had kept the monkeys, though the NIH later reversed its decision when the charges against Taub were overturned.

Newkirk and Pacheco found themselves thrust overnight into the public eye. The images of the restrained animals became iconic after &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published one of them on its front page. It was the first police raid on an animal-research facility in the U.S. and the first conviction (subsequently overturned) of an animal researcher. The controversy led to an amendment to the 1985 Animal Welfare Act, became the first animal-rights case to be heard before the United States Supreme Court, and established PETA as an internationally known animal-rights group, with Newkirk as its outspoken president.

===Attitude toward the ALF===

Newkirk has been criticized for publicizing actions carried out in the name of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). She has said that she does not support criminal acts such as arson:

I &quot;do&quot; support getting animals out in the same way I would have supported getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don&#x27;t support burning. I don&#x27;t support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren&#x27;t standing, so on some level I understand. I just don&#x27;t like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don&#x27;t want those buildings standing if they are going to hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.

She has been accused of having had advance knowledge of one ALF action. During the 1995 trial of Rod Coronado, in connection with an arson attack at Michigan State University (MSU), U.S. Attorney Michael Dettmer alleged that Newkirk had arranged, in advance of the attack, to have Coronado send her stolen documents from the university and a videotape of the action.

===Public image===
Newkirk is known, in particular, for the media stunts that she organizes to draw attention to animal-protection issues. In her will, for example, she has asked that her skin be turned into wallets, her feet into umbrella stands, and her flesh into &quot;Newkirk Nuggets&quot;, then grilled on a barbecue. &quot;We are complete press sluts&quot;, she told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2003: &quot;It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn&#x27;t make any waves.&quot;

Newkirks&#x27; actions have caused strong feelings, both positive and negative. Michael Specter, who did not see eye to eye with her, wrote:

Newkirk is well read, and she can be witty. When she is not proselytizing, denouncing, or attacking the ninety-nine per cent of humanity that sees the world differently from the way she does, she is good company. After years of detestable public behavior, however, she has the popular image of a monster. Whenever I mentioned her name to friends, they would recoil. And she becomes more disliked with every peta [sic] stunt; she can&#x27;t walk through an airport without accosting any woman who is wearing fur. She no longer takes vacations in tropical or poor countries like Mexico, because &quot;I spend the whole time rescuing animals from their horrid owners.&quot;

Specter also questioned her about a 2003 letter that she wrote to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to protest the use of a donkey as a suicide bomber. &quot;We are named People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&quot;, she replied. &quot;There are plenty of other groups that worry about the humans.&quot;

Elsewhere, Newkirk has said:

In this business I am very easy to cubby hole. As someone said to me the other day—they had seen the HBO special—and they said, &quot;Are you really a sad obsessed person?&quot; And I thought, No, I&#x27;m not really a sad person, except when I lie awake at night in winter thinking about all the animals out without shelter, and then I&#x27;m sad! Who wouldn&#x27;t be? Wouldn&#x27;t anybody be sad if they have a heart? It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve seen so much.

Newkirk has had celebrity friends and admirers who have spoken highly of her. Sam Simon said in an interview: &quot;I learned about animal rights from my favorite person in the whole world, Ingrid Newkirk at PETA.&quot; Also, Alec Baldwin contributed the following blurb to Newkirk&#x27;s book &quot;Making Kind Choices&quot;: &quot;Ingrid Newkirk is not only a thoughtful animal rights and environmental activist. She is an inspirational leader. A heroine. A woman upon whom so many depend, around the world, for information and guidance. In a world where all animals, everywhere, are more threatened than ever, Ingrid Newkirk is their champion.&quot;

Newkirk has been accused of employing a double standard for her organization&#x27;s practice of euthanizing animals for which it has neither the space nor resources to shelter. Debra Saunders, a critic of Newkirk, argues that &quot;PETA assails other parties for killing animals for food or research. Then it kills animals – but for really important reasons, such as running out of room&quot;. Newkirk explains on PETA&#x27;s website that, &quot;As long as animals are still purposely bred and people aren&#x27;t spaying and neutering their companions, open-admission animal shelters and organizations like PETA must do society&#x27;s dirty work. Euthanasia is not a solution to overpopulation but rather a tragic necessity given the present crisis.&quot;

Newkirk and PETA both oppose animal testing out of principle as well as on practical grounds. Specter asked whether she would be opposed to experiments on five thousand rats, or even chimpanzees, if it was needed to cure AIDS. She replied: &quot;Would you be opposed to experiments on your daughter if you knew it would save fifty million people?&quot;

<text>Ashur-nadin-ahhe II (&quot;Aššur-nādin-aḫḫē II&quot;)&quot;&quot; was king of Assyria from 1400 to 1391 BC. Preceded by Ashur-rim-nisheshu, he was succeeded by his brother, Eriba-Adad I.

Ashur-nadin-ahhe is an Assyrian personal name meaning “the god Ashur has given a brother” in the Akkadian language. Two Assyrian kings ruling in the 15th or early 14th century BC were called Ashur-nadin-ahhe. Hardly anything is known about these kings, but one of them is mentioned in one of the Amarna letters. In the letter from king Ashur-uballit of Assyria to the Pharaoh of Egypt, numbered EA 16, Ashur-nadin-ahhe is referred to as his ancestor who wrote to Egypt and received gold in return. This would imply an earlier diplomatic marriage and alliance between Assyria and Egypt during his reign. The name Ashur-nadin-ahhe mentioned in EA 16 has recently been contested as a faulty writing of Ashur-nadin-apli, another Assyrian king.

<text>Carbon steel is a steel with carbon content from about 0.05 up to 2.1 percent by weight. The definition of carbon steel from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) states:

* no minimum content is specified or required for chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, nickel, niobium, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, or any other element to be added to obtain a desired alloying effect;
* the specified minimum for copper does not exceed 0.40%;
* or the specified maximum for any of the following elements does not exceed: manganese 1.65%; silicon 0.60%; and copper 0.60%.

As the carbon content percentage rises, steel has the ability to become harder and stronger through heat treating; however, it becomes less ductile. Regardless of the heat treatment, a higher carbon content reduces weldability. In carbon steels, the higher carbon content lowers the melting point.

The term may be used to reference steel that is not stainless steel; in this use carbon steel may include alloy steels. 

High carbon steel has many uses such as milling machines, cutting tools (such as chisels) and high strength wires. These applications require a much finer microstructure, which improves toughness.

== Properties ==

Carbon steel is often divided into two main categories: low-carbon steel and high-carbon steel. It may also contain other elements, such as manganese, phosphorus, sulfur, and silicon, which can affect its properties. Carbon steel can be easily machined and welded, making it versatile for various applications. It can also be heat treated to improve its strength, hardness, and durability.

Carbon steel is susceptible to rust and corrosion, especially in environments with high moisture levels and/or salt. It can be shielded from corrosion by coating it with paint, varnish, or other protective material. Alternatively, it can be made from a stainless steel alloy that contains chromium, which provides excellent corrosion resistance. Carbon steel can be alloyed with other elements to improve its properties, such as by adding chromium and/or nickel to improve its resistance to corrosion and oxidation or adding molybdenum to improve its strength and toughness at high temperatures.

It is an environmentally friendly material, as it is easily recyclable and can be reused in various applications. It is energy-efficient to produce, as it requires less energy than other metals such as aluminium and copper.

==Type==
===Mild or low-carbon steel===
Mild steel (iron containing a small percentage of carbon, strong and tough but not readily tempered), also known as plain-carbon steel and low-carbon steel, is now the most common form of steel because its price is relatively low while it provides material properties that are acceptable for many applications. Mild steel contains approximately 0.05–0.30% carbon making it malleable and ductile. Mild steel has a relatively low tensile strength, but it is cheap and easy to form. Surface hardness can be increased with carburization.

The density of mild steel is approximately and the Young&#x27;s modulus is .

Low-carbon steels display &quot;yield-point runout&quot; where the material has two yield points. The first yield point (or upper yield point) is higher than the second and the yield drops dramatically after the upper yield point. If a low-carbon steel is only stressed to some point between the upper and lower yield point then the surface develops Lüder bands. Low-carbon steels contain less carbon than other steels and are easier to cold-form, making them easier to handle. Typical applications of low carbon steel are car parts, pipes, construction, and food cans.

==== High-tensile steel ====
High-tensile steels are low-carbon, or steels at the lower end of the medium-carbon range, which have additional alloying ingredients in order to increase their strength, wear properties or specifically tensile strength. These alloying ingredients include chromium, molybdenum, silicon, manganese, nickel, and vanadium. Impurities such as phosphorus and sulfur have their maximum allowable content restricted.

* EN25 steel – 2.521% nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel
* EN26 steel

===Higher-carbon steels===
Carbon steels which can successfully undergo heat-treatment have a carbon content in the range of 0.30–1.70% by weight. Trace impurities of various other elements can significantly affect the quality of the resulting steel. Trace amounts of sulfur in particular make the steel red-short, that is, brittle and crumbly at high working temperatures. Low-alloy carbon steel, such as A36 grade, contains about 0.05% sulfur and melt around . Manganese is often added to improve the hardenability of low-carbon steels. These additions turn the material into a low-alloy steel by some definitions, but AISI&#x27;s definition of carbon steel allows up to 1.65% manganese by weight.
There are two types of higher carbon steels which are high carbon steel and the ultra high carbon steel. The reason for the limited use of high carbon steel is that it has extremely poor ductility and weldability and has a higher cost of production. The applications best suited for the high carbon steels is its use in the spring industry, farm industry, and in the production of wide range of high-strength wires.

==AISI classification==
The following classification method is based on the American AISI/SAE standard. Other international standards including DIN (Germany), GB (China), BS/EN (UK), AFNOR (France), UNI (Italy), SS (Sweden), UNE (Spain), JIS (Japan), ASTM standards, and others.

Carbon steel is broken down into four classes based on carbon content:

===Low-carbon steel===
Low-carbon steel has 0.05 to 0.15% carbon (plain carbon steel) content.

===Medium-carbon steel===
Medium-carbon steel has approximately 0.3–0.5% carbon content. It balances ductility and strength and has good wear resistance. It is used for large parts, forging and automotive components.

===High-carbon steel===
High-carbon steel has approximately 0.6 to 1.0% carbon content. It is very strong, used for springs, edged tools, and high-strength wires.

===Ultra-high-carbon steel===
Ultra-high-carbon steel has approximately 1.25–2.0% carbon content. Steels that can be tempered to great hardness. Used for special purposes such as (non-industrial-purpose) knives, axles, and punches. Most steels with more than 2.5% carbon content are made using powder metallurgy.

==Heat treatment==

The purpose of heat treating carbon steel is to change the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, Young&#x27;s modulus (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) and leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the eutectoid temperature (about ) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained pearlite and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with α-ferrite (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of cementite formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible:

; Spheroidizing: Spheroidite forms when carbon steel is heated to approximately for over 30 hours. Spheroidite can form at lower temperatures but the time needed drastically increases, as this is a diffusion-controlled process. The result is a structure of rods or spheres of cementite within primary structure (ferrite or pearlite, depending on which side of the eutectoid you are on). The purpose is to soften higher carbon steels and allow more formability. This is the softest and most ductile form of steel.
; Full annealing: A hypoeutectoid carbon steel (carbon composition smaller than the eutectoid one) is heated to approximately above the austenictic temperature (A3), whereas a hypereutectoid steel is heated to a temperature above the eutectoid one (A1) for a certain number of hours; this ensures all the ferrite transforms into austenite (although cementite might still exist in hypereutectoid steels). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20 °C (36 °F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse pearlitic structure, which means the &quot;bands&quot; of pearlite are thick. Fully annealed steel is soft and ductile, with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only spheroidized steel is softer and more ductile.
; Process annealing: A process used to relieve stress in a cold-worked carbon steel with less than 0.3% C. The steel is usually heated to for 1 hour, but sometimes temperatures as high as . The image above shows the process annealing area.
; Isothermal annealing: It is a process in which hypoeutectoid steel is heated above the upper critical temperature. This temperature is maintained for a time and then reduced to below the lower critical temperature and is again maintained. It is then cooled to room temperature. This method eliminates any temperature gradient.
; Normalizing: Carbon steel is heated to approximately for 1 hour; this ensures the steel completely transforms to austenite. The steel is then air-cooled, which is a cooling rate of approximately per minute. This results in a fine pearlitic structure, and a more-uniform structure. Normalized steel has a higher strength than annealed steel; it has a relatively high strength and hardness.
; Quenching: Carbon steel with at least 0.4 wt% C is heated to normalizing temperatures and then rapidly cooled (quenched) in water, brine, or oil to the critical temperature. The critical temperature is dependent on the carbon content, but as a general rule is lower as the carbon content increases. This results in a martensitic structure; a form of steel that possesses a super-saturated carbon content in a deformed body-centered cubic (BCC) crystalline structure, properly termed body-centered tetragonal (BCT), with much internal stress. Thus quenched steel is extremely hard but brittle, usually too brittle for practical purposes. These internal stresses may cause stress cracks on the surface. Quenched steel is approximately three times harder (four with more carbon) than normalized steel.
; Martempering (marquenching): Martempering is not actually a tempering procedure, hence the term &quot;marquenching&quot;. It is a form of isothermal heat treatment applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the &quot;martensite start temperature&quot;. At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the retained austenite which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases impact resistance.
; Tempering: This is the most common heat treatment encountered because the final properties can be precisely determined by the temperature and time of the tempering. Tempering involves reheating quenched steel to a temperature below the eutectoid temperature and then cooling. The elevated temperature allows very small amounts spheroidite to form, which restores ductility but reduces hardness. Actual temperatures and times are carefully chosen for each composition.
; Austempering: The austempering process is the same as martempering, except the quench is interrupted and the steel is held in the molten salt bath at temperatures between , and then cooled at a moderate rate. The resulting steel, called bainite, produces an acicular microstructure in the steel that has great strength (but less than martensite), greater ductility, higher impact resistance, and less distortion than martensite steel. The disadvantage of austempering is it can be used only on a few sheets of steel, and it requires a special salt bath.

==Case hardening==

Case hardening processes harden only the exterior of the steel part, creating a hard, wear-resistant skin (the &quot;case&quot;) but preserving a tough and ductile interior. Carbon steels are not very hardenable meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better hardenability, so they can be through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core flexible and shock-absorbing.

<doc id="633594" wikidata="Q3186046" url="?curid=633594" title="Josiah Tongogara">
<text>Josiah Magama Tongogara (4 February 1938 – 26 December 1979) was a prominent Zimbabwean guerrilla commander during the Rhodesian Bush War. He was the brother of the current Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa&#x27;s first wife, Jayne. He attended the Lancaster House conference that led to Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence and the end of white minority rule.

==Early life==
Tongogara and his parents lived on the farm owned by the parents of Ian Smith, Rhodesia&#x27;s last prime minister. It was where Tongogara first met Ian Smith.

==In politics==
Tongogara was one of several rebel commanders operating from outside of Rhodesia&#x27;s borders to free the country from white rule. In 1973 he took over command from Herbert Chitepo of the armed forces of the Zimbabwe African National Union. And in 1975, he put down an internal revolt by members of the Manyika tribe and consolidated that control with the assistance of Mujuru, aka Rex Nhongo. Herbert Chitepo, who may have encouraged the Manyika revolt, was killed by a car bomb that year, and a Special International Commission in Zambia found Tongogara, among others, responsible.

At the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979, Tongogara was a crucial &quot;moderating&quot; force, according to Lord Carrington, the then British Foreign Secretary, who chaired the talks. By then Tongogara openly favoured unity between ZANU and Joshua Nkomo&#x27;s ZAPU. &quot;Robert Mugabe referred to unity with Zapu as sharing the spoils with those who had not shouldered the burden of fighting,&quot; says Wilfred Mhanda, a former ZANLA commander who was imprisoned in Mozambique for allegedly leading an internal revolt within the party. As Lancaster House concluded, Tongogara returned to Mozambique, where ZANLA was based, to inform his soldiers of the ceasefire. Among them was Margaret Dongo, who, aged fifteen, had crossed into Mozambique to join the guerrillas, adopting the chimurenga (liberation war) name of Tichaona Muhondo (&quot;we shall see/resolve this in the battle&quot;).

==Death==
Six days after the Lancaster House Agreement was signed Robert Mugabe, on the Voice of Zimbabwe radio station, conveyed &quot;an extremely sad message&quot; to &quot;all the fighting people of Zimbabwe&quot;: the forty-one-year-old Tongogara was dead, killed in a car accident in Mozambique on 26 December 1979.

Josiah Tungamirai, the ZANLA High Command&#x27;s political commissar, relates that on the night of the fatality, he and Tongogara had been travelling with others in two vehicles from Maputo to Chimoio. Tungamirai said he was in the front vehicle. It was dark and the roads were bad. Tungamirai&#x27;s car passed a military vehicle that had been carelessly abandoned, with no warning signs at the side of the road. After that, he could no longer see the headlights of the following car in his rear view mirror. Eventually he turned back, and, as he had feared, they found Tongogara&#x27;s car had struck the abandoned vehicle. Tongogara was sitting in the front passenger seat. Tungamirai told me that he had struggled to lift Tongogara out of the wrecked car. He said that as he was doing so, Tongogara heaved a huge sigh and died in his arms.

Margaret Dongo was one of the last people to see him alive. &quot;We were eighteen girls who were having a function and he came to say a few words to bless the occasion.&quot;

ZANU released a statement from the undertaker, Mr K.J Stokes (not Mr R Silke) saying his injuries were consistent with a road accident, but no autopsy results or pictures were released.

===Theories on death===
A CIA intelligence briefing of 28 December 1979 said Tongogara was a potential political rival to Mugabe because of his &quot;ambition, popularity and decisive style&quot;. On the same day, the US embassy in Zambia reported, &quot;Almost no one in Lusaka accepts Mugabe&#x27;s assurance that Tongogara died accidentally. When the ambassador told the Soviet ambassador the news, the surprised Soviet immediately charged &#x27;inside job&#x27;&quot;.

Ian Smith also insisted in his memoirs that Tongogara&#x27;s &quot;own people&quot; killed him and that he had disclosed at Lancaster House that Tongogara was under threat. Smith wrote, &quot;I made a point of discussing his death with our police commissioner and head of special branch, and both assured me that Tongogara had been assassinated&quot;.

A former Detective in the Law and Order Section of the former British South Africa Police saw photographs of Tongogara&#x27;s body. There were three wounds, consistent with gunshot wounds, to his upper torso. The undertaker&#x27;s statement was not a &quot;formal&quot; autopsy report and so was dismissed by all but the senior politburo of ZANU.

In spite of all the rumours, Mr. R. Silke, the pathologist for Mashfords Funeral Home in Zimbabwe, insisted in a 1982 television documentary, &quot;Tongo&quot;, that the theory of gunshot wounds on Tongogara&#x27;s body was false, as he had personally inspected the body and that the injuries that he found were consistent with road accident trauma.

==Legacy==
In 1990, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence, streets were renamed in Tongogara&#x27;s honour, including North Avenue in Harare, which became Josiah Tongogara Avenue, and Wilson Street in Bulawayo, which became Josiah Tongogara Street.

In 2005, Tongogara was honoured on a stamp of Zimbabwe.

In 2012 it was revealed that Tongogara&#x27;s wife was not receiving war veteran&#x27;s widow benefits.

On 6 December 2017, the King George VI Barracks, which houses the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) headquarters, was officially renamed Josiah Magama Tongogara Barracks.

<text>Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge (8 February 1794 – 25 March 1867) was a German analytical chemist. Runge identified the mydriatic (pupil dilating) effects of belladonna (deadly nightshade) extract, identified caffeine, and discovered the first coal tar dye (aniline blue).

==Early life==
Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge was born near Hamburg on 8 February 1794. From a young age, Runge conducted chemical experiments, serendipitously identifying the mydriatic (pupil dilating) effects of belladonna (deadly nightshade) extract.

==Career==
In 1819, Runge was invited to show Goethe how belladonna caused dilation of the pupil, which Runge did, using a cat as an experimental subject. Goethe was so impressed with the demonstration that

:&quot;Nachdem Goethe mir seine größte Zufriedenheit sowol über die Erzählung des durch scheinbaren schwarzen Staar Geretteten, wie auch über das andere ausgesprochen, übergab er mir noch eine Schachtel mit Kaffeebohnen, die ein Grieche ihm als etwas Vorzügliches gesandt. &quot;Auch diese können sie zu Ihren Untersuchungen brauchen,&quot; sagte Goethe. Er hatte recht; denn bald darauf entdeckte ich darin das, wegen seines großen Stickstoffgehaltes so berühmt gewordene Coffein.&quot;

:&quot;After Goethe had expressed to me his greatest satisfaction regarding the account of the man whom I&#x27;d rescued [from serving in Napoleon&#x27;s army] by apparent &quot;black star&quot; [i.e., amaurosis, blindness] as well as the other, he handed me a carton of coffee beans, which a Greek had sent him as a delicacy. &quot;You can also use these in your investigations,&quot; said Goethe. He was right; for soon thereafter I discovered therein caffeine, which became so famous on account of its high nitrogen content.&quot;

A few months later, Runge identified caffeine.

Runge studied chemistry in Jena and Berlin, where he obtained his doctorate. After touring Europe for three years, he taught chemistry at the University of Breslau until 1831. From then on he worked for a state-owned chemical company in Oranienburg near Berlin, but was dismissed at the age of 58 when the company was privatised in 1852. He lost his pension and company flat in 1855 due to a dispute over intellectual property with the new management of the company. He died twelve years later in Oranienburg. He is commemorated by the plant genus &quot;Rungia&quot; named after him in 1832 by the botanist Nathaniel Wallich.

==Discoveries==
His chemical work included purine chemistry, the identification of caffeine, the discovery of the first coal tar dye (aniline blue), (Runge called aniline &quot;Kyanol&quot; (blue-oil)) coal tar products (and a large number of substances that derive from coal tar), paper chromatography, pyrrole, chinoline, phenol, thymol and atropine. Runge placed drops of reactant solutions on blotting paper and then added a drop of a second reactant solution on top of the first drop. The solutions would react as they spread through the blotting paper, often producing colored patterns. His results were published in two books, &quot;Farbenchemie. Musterbilder für Freunde des Schönen und zum Gebrauch für Zeichner, Maler, Verzierer und Zeugdrucker, dargestellt durch chemische Wechselwirkung&quot; and &quot;Der Bildungstrieb der Stoffe, veranschaulicht in selbstständig gewachsenen Bilder&quot;.

In 1855, he was the first to notice the phenomenon of Liesegang rings, observing them in the course of experiments on the precipitation of reagents in blotting paper.

==Honours==
In 1832 botanist Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck published &quot;Rungia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae (about 82 species worldwide), with its name honouring Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge.

On February 8, 2019, Google celebrated his 225th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>Pholidoteuthis is a genus of squid in the monotypic family Pholidoteuthidae, comprising at least two species. The defunct genus &quot;Tetronychoteuthis&quot; was previously incorporated into Pholidoteuthidae based upon a singular taxon known as &quot;Tetronychoteuthis massyae&quot;. Following the discovery of &quot;Pholidoteuthis boschmai&quot; in 1950, &quot;T. massaye&quot; was placed into &quot;Pholidoteuthis&quot;, with &quot;Tetronoychoteuthis&quot; considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. &quot;P. boschmai&quot; is now considered a junior synonym of &quot;P. massyae&quot;.

<text>Tool steel is any of various carbon steels and alloy steels that are particularly well-suited to be made into tools and tooling, including cutting tools, dies, hand tools, knives, and others. Their suitability comes from their distinctive hardness, resistance to abrasion and deformation, and their ability to hold a cutting edge at elevated temperatures. As a result, tool steels are suited for use in the shaping of other materials, as for example in cutting, machining, stamping, or forging.

Tool steels have a carbon content between 0.4% and 1.5%. The presence of carbides in their matrix plays the dominant role in the qualities of tool steel. The four major alloying elements that form carbides in tool steel are: tungsten, chromium, vanadium and molybdenum. The rate of dissolution of the different carbides into the austenite form of the iron determines the high-temperature performance of steel (slower is better, making for a heat-resistant steel). Proper heat treatment of these steels is important for adequate performance. The manganese content is often kept low to minimize the possibility of cracking during water quenching.

There are six groups of tool steels: water-hardening, cold-work, shock-resistant, high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose. The choice of group to select depends on cost, working temperature, required surface hardness, strength, shock resistance, and toughness requirements. The more severe the service condition (higher temperature, abrasiveness, corrosiveness, loading), the higher the alloy content and consequent amount of carbides required for the tool steel.

Tool steels are used for cutting, pressing, extruding, and coining of metals and other materials. Their use in tooling is essential; injection molds for example require tool steels for their resistance to abrasion- an important criterion for mold durability which enables hundreds of thousands of moldings operations over its lifetime.

The AISI-SAE grades of tool steel is the most common scale used to identify various grades of tool steel. Individual alloys within a grade are given a number; for example: A2, O1, etc.

== Water-hardening group ==
W-group tool steel gets its name from its defining property of having to be water quenched. W-grade steel is essentially high carbon plain-carbon steel. This group of tool steel is the most commonly used tool steel because of its low cost compared to others. They work well for parts and applications where high temperatures are not encountered; above it begins to soften to a noticeable degree. Its hardenability is low, so W-group tool steels must be subjected to a rapid quenching, requiring the use of water. These steels can attain high hardness (above 66 Rockwell C) and are rather brittle compared to other tool steels. W-steels are still sold, especially for springs, but are much less widely used than they were in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This is partly because W-steels warp and crack much more during quench than oil-quenched or air hardening steels.

The toughness of W-group tool steels is increased by alloying with manganese, silicon and molybdenum. Up to 0.20% of vanadium is used to retain fine grain sizes during heat treating.

Typical applications for various carbon compositions are for W-steels:

* 0.60–0.75% carbon: machine parts, chisels, setscrews; properties include medium hardness with good toughness and shock resistance.
* 0.76–0.90% carbon: forging dies, hammers, and sledges.
* 0.91–1.10% carbon: general purpose tooling applications that require a good balance of wear resistance and toughness, such as rasps, drills, cutters, and shear blades.
* 1.11–1.30% carbon: files, small drills, lathe tools, razor blades, and other light-duty applications where more wear resistance is required without great toughness. Steel of about 0.8% C gets as hard as steel with more carbon, but the free iron carbide particles in 1% or 1.25% carbon steel make it hold an edge better. However, the fine edge probably rusts off faster than it wears off, if it is used to cut acidic or salty materials.

== Cold-work group ==

The cold-work tool steels include the O series (oil-hardening), the A series (air-hardening), and the D series (high carbon-chromium). These are steels used to cut or form materials that are at low temperatures. This group possesses high hardenability and wear resistance, and average toughness and heat softening resistance. They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching. More alloying elements are used in these steels, as compared to the water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels&#x27; hardenability, and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack. They have high surface hardness and are often used to make knife blades. The machinability of the oil hardening grades is high but for the high carbon-chromium types is low.

=== Oil-hardening: the O series ===
This series includes an O1 type, an O2 type, an O6 type and an O7 type. All steels in this group are typically hardened at , oil quenched, then tempered below .

=== Air-hardening: the A series ===
The first air-hardening-grade tool steel was mushet steel, which was known as &quot;air-hardening steel&quot; at the time.

Modern air-hardening steels are characterized by low distortion during heat treatment because of their high-chromium content. Their machinability is good and they have a balance of wear resistance and toughness (i.e. between the D and shock-resistant grades).

=== High carbon-chromium: the D series ===

The D series of the cold-work class of tool steels, which originally included types D2, D3, D6, and D7, contains between 10% and 13% chromium (which is unusually high). These steels retain their hardness up to a temperature of . Common applications for these tool steels include forging dies, die-casting die blocks, and drawing dies. Due to their high chromium content, certain D-type tool steels are often considered stainless or semi-stainless, however their corrosion resistance is very limited due to the precipitation of the majority of their chromium and carbon constituents as carbides.

== Shock-resisting group ==

The high shock resistance and good hardenability are provided by chromium-tungsten, silicon-molybdenum, silicon-manganese alloying. Shock-resisting group tool steels (S) are designed to resist shock at both low and high temperatures. A low carbon content is required for the necessary toughness (approximately 0.5% carbon). Carbide-forming alloys provide the necessary abrasion resistance, hardenability, and hot-work characteristics. This family of steels displays very high impact toughness and relatively low abrasion resistance and can attain relatively high hardness of 58 to 60 HRC. In the US, toughness usually derives from 1 to 2% silicon and 0.5–1% molybdenum content. In Europe, shock steels often contain carbon and around 3% nickel. A range of 1.75% to 2.75% nickel is still used in some shock-resisting and high-strength low-alloy steels (HSLA), such as L6, 4340, and Swedish saw steel, but it is relatively expensive. An example of its use is in the production of jackhammer bits.

== High-speed group ==
== Hot-working group ==

Hot-working steels are a group of steel used to cut or shape material at high temperatures. H-group tool steels were developed for strength and hardness during prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures. These tool steels are low carbon and moderate to high alloy that provide good hot hardness and toughness and fair wear resistance due to a substantial amount of carbide. H1 to H19 are based on a chromium content of 5%; H20 to H39 are based on a tungsten content of 9-18% and a chromium content of 3–4%; H40 to H59 are molybdenum based.

Examples include DIN 1.2344 tool steel (H13).

== Special-purpose group ==

* is short for plastic mold steels. They are designed to meet the requirements of zinc die casting and plastic injection molding dies.
* L-type tool steel is short for low alloy special purpose tool steel. L6 is extremely tough.
* F-type tool steel is water hardened and substantially more wear resistant than W-type tool steel.

<text>Rate Field (formerly Comiskey Park II, U.S. Cellular Field and Guaranteed Rate Field) is a baseball stadium located on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. It is the home ballpark of Major League Baseball’s Chicago White Sox, one of the city&#x27;s two MLB teams, and is owned by the state of Illinois through the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. Completed at a cost of US$137 million, the park opened as Comiskey Park on April 18, 1991, taking its name from the original Comiskey Park, the team&#x27;s home since 1910.

Rate Field is situated just to the west of the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago&#x27;s Armour Square neighborhood, adjacent to the more famous neighborhood of Bridgeport. The stadium was built directly across 35th Street from the original Comiskey Park, which was demolished to make room for a parking lot for the new venue. The location of Old Comiskey&#x27;s home plate is represented by a marble plaque on the sidewalk next to Rate Field, with the foul lines painted in the parking lot. The spectator ramp across 35th Street is designed in such a way (partly curved, partly straight but angling east-northeast) that it echoes the contour of the old first-base grandstand.

==History==
The stadium was the first new major sporting facility built in Chicago since Chicago Stadium in 1929. It was also the last one built before the wave of new &quot;retro-classic&quot; ballparks in the 1990s and 2000s.

A few design features from the old Comiskey Park were retained. The front facade of the park features arched windows. The &quot;exploding scoreboard&quot; pays homage to the original, installed by Bill Veeck at the old park in 1960. The original field dimensions and seating configuration were very similar to those of Royals Stadium (now Kauffman Stadium) in Kansas City, which had been the last baseball-only park built in the majors, in 1973.

As originally built, the park was criticized by many fans because of the height of the upper deck. The original architect, HOK Sport (now Populous), wanted to eliminate the overhang problems present in many stadiums built since the 1970s. With this in mind, the upper deck was set back over the lower deck, and the stands rose fairly gradually. While it gave nearly every seat in the upper level an unobstructed view of the field, it also created one of the highest upper decks in baseball. The first row of seats in the upper deck of the new stadium is as far from the field as the highest row of seats in the upper deck at the old stadium. Due to the field being practically at street level, the original upper deck made the park look like a cookie-cutter stadium from the outside. Fans sitting in this area did not get much chance for relief, as it was one of the few parks in Major League Baseball that did not allow fans sitting in the upper deck to venture anywhere else in the park, such as the lower deck concourse.

In response to fan complaints, the stadium has undergone numerous renovations since the 2001 season in order to retrofit the facility to current architectural trends. These changes have included building a multi-tiered concourse beyond center field, adjusting the fences to make the outfield less symmetrical, and most significantly, the removal of 6,600 seats at the top of the upper deck.

The uppermost tier of the park now has a white and black screen behind the top row of seats, and is topped by a flat canopy roof supported by black steel truss supports that obstruct the view of a few seats. The original blue seats were also replaced by forest green seats. The new green and black color scheme, upper-level screen set back from the outer wall and canopy roof are reminiscent of the old Comiskey Park, as well as other classic baseball stadiums. Murals to the interior concourses were also added, a prominent feature of the old stadium.

The stadium houses 103 luxury suites located on two levels, as well as 1,822 &quot;club seats&quot; on 300-level mezzanine between the lower deck and upper deck. The club seats receive in-seat wait-staff, and benefit from an enclosed concourse with multiple television viewing areas and bar-style concessions. The stadium has 400 wheelchair-accessible seats, 38 public restrooms, 12 escalators, and 15 elevators. The new suites were one example of why the old Comiskey Park was demolished, as suites generate more revenue.

===Naming rights===
Originally called Comiskey Park, the stadium was renamed U.S. Cellular Field in 2003, after Chicago-based telecommunications company U.S. Cellular purchased the naming rights at US$68 million for 20 years. U.S. Cellular would later pay $13 million to end the agreement seven years early, saving an estimated $10.8 million. 

The stadium&#x27;s next name, Guaranteed Rate Field, was announced on October 31, 2016, after the Chicago-based private residential mortgage company Guaranteed Rate purchased the naming rights in a 13-year deal. It was later revealed that Guaranteed Rate would pay $20.4 million over ten years for the 13-year agreement. This translates to an average payment of $2.4 million, less than U.S. Cellular&#x27;s yearly payment of $3.4 million as well as below the average MLB naming rights payment of $3.6 million at the time of the deal&#x27;s signing. 

Coinciding with Guaranteed Rate&#x27;s rebranding as Rate, the Sox announced the ballpark would henceforth be known as Rate Field on December 17, 2024.

===Extensive renovations (2008–present)===
Renovations were added that were not part of the original plan:

====2008 season====
* The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority unveiled the first environmentally friendly permeable paving parking lot to be used by a Major League sports facility on April 8. The new lot (Lot L) saves taxpayer money by substantially reducing the amount of water entering Chicago&#x27;s stormwater system, improving overall water quality and help reduce the Urban heat island effect.
* The White Sox Legacy Brick Program unveiled its brick plaza outside Gate 4 on April 11. Each Legacy Brick is inscribed with a personalized message and has become part of a new baseball diamond-shaped plaza outside the main entrance to the ballpark. A white, bronze and granite sculpture weighing over 25 tons that celebrates the 2005 White Sox World Series championship stands at the center of the plaza, with a historical timeline of the franchise along the diamond&#x27;s base paths. Players on the sculpture from the 2005 team are Paul Konerko, Joe Crede, Orlando Hernández, Geoff Blum, and Juan Uribe.
* Plasma flatscreen television sets were added throughout the outfield concourse and at the top of its beer concession stands.
* A bronze statue of Harold Baines was placed on the right field concourse behind Section 105 on July 20.

====2009 season====
* About $15 million in renovations were made to Gate 5 (north of 35th Street) to improve access to the park. The demolition (beginning of November 2008) of the easternmost portion of the pedestrian ramp and removal of the top two levels of the easternmost foot bridge across 35th Street, reducing it to one level with continuing access to the park on the main concourse level. The second foot bridge at Gate 5, about west of the east bridge, continues to offer access to the park on three levels. The project also included installation of escalators in a new, weather-protected enclosure and installation of elevators which provide additional access for fans with disabilities. The project was completed by opening day on April 7, when the White Sox defeated the Kansas City Royals 4–2.
* Inside the park, a new scoreboard (23 ft x 68 ft) with 913,000 LED lights (similar to Tropicana Field) replaced the older out-of-town scoreboard in right field. In addition to displaying both lineups (that of the Sox and their opponents) the board showed season stats for the current batter and pitcher. It also served as an upgrade to the old &quot;around-the-league&quot; scoreboard that it replaced. While the old scoreboard showed only the current innings, scores, and pitchers&#x27; jersey numbers, the new board was capable of showing balls, strikes, outs, locations of any baserunners, and the current batter and pitcher by last name instead of by number. A slight disadvantage is that the new board only showed four games at a time in this manner, whereas the old board showed every game in progress simultaneously.
* A small plaque honoring Jim Thome located on the center field fan deck for his home run shot that landed there, becoming the first player ever to do so on June 4, 2008. The White Sox defeated the Royals in that game. Thome duplicated this feat again on September 30, 2008, in a one-game playoff against AL Central rival Minnesota Twins. His home run proved to be the game winner in a 1–0 shutout to win the AL Central.
* For White Sox players, a new hydrotherapy room with three combinational hot-and-cold whirlpool tubs. An underwater treadmill that can curb problems relating to the abdominals, back and knee and strengthens the muscles and hip, is installed in one of the tubs.
* &quot;The Catch&quot; was written on the left-center field wall above Billy Pierce&#x27;s image (now above a blank wall), at the location where DeWayne Wise made a catch to rob Gabe Kapler of a 9th-inning home run and ensure Mark Buehrle&#x27;s perfect game on July 23, 2009.

====2010–present====
2010 season
* A new outdoor Beer Garden named &quot;TBD&#x27;s&quot; was installed by July 26 (when the White Sox hosted the Seattle Mariners) at Gate 5. The area served beer, wine, soda, and water, and also had 12 flat-screen TVs. TBD&#x27;s was taken down and replaced by &quot;ChiSox Bar and Grill&quot; in 2011. The restaurant was open at 11 AM on gamedays. Although it is technically outside the park and accessible with or without a game ticket, fans must be 21 or older to enter. Home Plate Club opens behind home plate
* Frank Thomas&#x27; number and picture were added to the outfield wall as his number was retired.

2011 season
* A new Metra station (Jones/Bronzeville) on the Rock Island line (designed by Infrastructure Engineering, Inc.) worth $7.9 million was planned to be opened in 2009, but due to a year-long delay of construction, the station opened in 2011 after groundbreaking on June 29, 2009. The new station is located East of the ballpark just beyond the I-90/I-94 Dan Ryan Expressway.
* A multi-level restaurant and bar inside Gate 5 called &quot;ChiSox Bar and Grill&quot; (formerly known as Bacardi at the Park). The establishment features both indoor and outdoor seating and a wide variety of food, drinks, and entertainment for Guaranteed Rate Field guests that started in April 2011. &quot;ChiSox Bar and Grill&quot; is open during the baseball season, but plans made the restaurant and bar a year-round establishment.
* A bronze statue of Frank Thomas was unveiled on July 31, against the Boston Red Sox. It is the eighth statue to be placed on the outfield concourse.

2012 season
* Chicago Sports Depot, a new merchandise store, opened on November 19, 2011, right next to Gate 5 and ChiSox Bar and Grill.

2014 season
* A bronze statue of Paul Konerko was unveiled on September 27, against the Kansas City Royals. It is the ninth statue to be placed on the outfield concourse.

2016 season
* Three new HD video boards were installed before the start of the 2016 season at a cost of $7.3 million. The auxiliary boards in left and right field, and the main video board in center, were all replaced with new HD screens. The project was funded via the Sox&#x27; capital repairs budget.

2018 season
* The visitor&#x27;s clubhouse was renovated to meet up to date technology.
* A virtual reality home run derby batting cage was installed in the Chicago Sports Depot.
* A high safety netting has been extended to the outfield end of both dugouts, or from section 122 to 142.
* A new LED ribbon board was extended to run the entire length of the grandstand, meaning the retired numbers that resided behind home plate had to be moved to the first and third-base lines.

2019 season
* A 326-seat section dubbed &quot;The Goose Island&quot; (now known as the &quot;Miller Lite Landing&quot;) replaced sections 106 and 107 in right field. The section includes running water fixtures on all four sides to create the &quot;island&quot; of beer and baseball. The section also features individual seating, spaces for group parties and a standing room area where fans can interact near the outfield concourse. The first few rows of the section also provide a &quot;modernized&quot; game day experience with cushioned seats, device charging ports, television screens and more. The revamped section expanded the presence of Goose Island, which is owned by beverage conglomerate Anheuser-Busch InBev, inside the stadium. The previously known Craft Cave became the Goose Island Craft Cave. Formerly a Goose Island tap statue overlooked the stadium from the special section. The section opened by opening day on April 4.
* An extension of the safety netting from the dugouts to foul poles was completed during the 2019 season.

2021 season
* The White Sox added the flickering LED lights for whenever the team either comes out of their dugout before the first pitch, hits a home run, wins a game, or whenever their closer comes out of the bullpen.
2022 season
* The White Sox removed their outfield banners in their light towers.
2023 season
* The White Sox added two new viewing bars in the 500 level prior to the start of the 2023 season. To accomplish this, eight rows of seats in the two 500-level sections had to be removed. According to the website that released the permit, the project cost was approximately $284,500. Located near Sections 516 and 548, the bars feature walk-up beverage service with seating offering excellent views of the field, creating new amenities for all fans on the 500-level concourse. 
*The White Sox added turf around the monument of the old Comiskey Park home plate outside the stadium.

The Red Line is also used by Cubs fans to reach Wrigley Field (Addison Station) on the North side of Chicago. (When the White Sox take on the Cubs every year, usually in June, many fans will use the Red Line to get to the games. The series is dubbed the &quot;Cross-Town Classic&quot; or the &quot;Windy City Showdown.&quot;) 

A new Metra station (35th Street), which helps fans with more accessibility, opened on the Rock Island line in 2011. It is also accessible by CTA bus route #35 (31st/35th Street) and the suburban Pace Rate Field Express shuttle service.

Rate Field is just west of the I-90/94 Dan Ryan Expressway. The &quot;Dan Ryan&quot; was under construction in 2006–2007 in hopes of relieving traffic congestion.

Pierzynski when Pierzynski took a couple steps toward his dugout before he began to run to first base. Home plate umpire Doug Eddings said it was a uncaught third strike and had to be thrown to first which no throw was made because they all thought the inning was over and Pierzynski was called safe and allowed the inning to continue. Replay appeared to show the ball to be caught cleanly by catcher Josh Paul but replay review did not exist back then and the call stood. The White Sox would pinch run Pierzynski with Pablo Ozuna. Ozuna would steal second before Joe Crede would walk it off with a base hit off the left field wall and won the game for the White Sox 2–1 to tie the series at one game a piece.

Mark Buehrle strikes out six batters and records 11 ground ball outs to get a perfect game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The perfect game included an amazing play by White Sox outfielder DeWayne Wise, who came in as a defensive replacement, where he robbed a home run from Gabe Kapler in the top of the 9th. It is the second no-hitter of Buehrle&#x27;s career, the last occurring on April 18, 2007, against the Texas Rangers. It was also the franchise&#x27;s second perfect game with the last one being Charlie Robertson in 1922. He is the first player since Hideo Nomo to throw multiple no-hitters, and the first to throw a perfect game since Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks did it May 18, 2004 against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field. In a remarkable coincidence, Buehrle&#x27;s first no-hitter was 2 hours and 3 minutes and Buehrle&#x27;s second was just as long. Another coincidence was home plate umpire (#56, same as Buehrle&#x27;s) Eric Cooper who called both Buehrle&#x27;s no-hitters. Yet another coincidence is that Ramón Castro, who caught for Buehrle, wears the No. 27 on his jersey, the number of consecutive outs needed for a perfect game.

==History==
It was created in 1966 as &quot;Victoria—Haliburton&quot; from parts of Victoria, Peterborough and Hastings—Frontenac and ridings.

It consisted initially of
* in the County of Hastings: the Townships of Bangor, Carlow, Herschel, McClure, Monteagle and Wicklow;
* the County of Haliburton;
* in the County of Ontario: the Townships of Brock, Mara, Rama and Thorah, the islands in Lake Couchiching belonging to Rama Indian Reserve No. 32, but excluding all islands belonging to Georgina Island Indian Reserve No. 33;
* in the County of Peterborough: the Townships of Anstruther, Burleigh, Cavendish, Chandos, Galway and Harvey;
* the County of Victoria.

In 1976, the Township of Manvers in the county of Victoria, all parts of the county of Hastings, all townships other than the Township of Brock) in the Regional Municipality of Durham (formerly the County of Ontario) were excluded from the riding, and the Township of Georgina in the Regional Municipality of York was added.

In 1987, the riding was redefined to consist of the counties of Haliburton and Victoria, the Township of Brock in the Regional Municipality of Durham,
and, in the County of Peterborough, the Village of Millbrook and the townships of Burleigh and Anstruther, Cavan, Chandos, Galway and Cavendish, and Harvey.

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the County of Victoria, the Township of Brock in the Regional Municipality of Durham, the County of Haliburton (excluding the townships of Sherborne, McClintock, Livingstone, Lawrence and Nightingale), and the part of the County of Peterborough lying north of and including the townships of Burleigh and Anstruther, Chandos and Harvey, including the Village of Millbrook and the Township of Cavan.

The name of the electoral district was changed in 1998 to &quot;Haliburton—Victoria—Brock&quot;.

The name of the electoral district was changed in 2003 when Victoria County became the city of Kawartha Lakes.

In 2013, the federal redistribution saw slight changes to the riding which removed the County of Peterborough Townships of Trent Lakes and North Kawartha. Both of these townships were placed in the new riding of Peterborough-Kawartha.

In 2023, the Township of Brock in the Regional Municipality of Durham was removed from the riding and placed in the new riding of York—Durham, and the County of Peterborough Townships of Trent Lakes and North Kawartha were added. As a consequence, the name of the electoral district changed to &quot;Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes&quot;. These boundaries will be used at the first election held after April 22, 2024.

<doc id="633616" wikidata="Q3295256" url="?curid=633616" title="Because I Can (Katy Rose album)">
<text>Because I Can is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Katy Rose. V2 Records released the album on January 27, 2004. Rose co-wrote &quot;Because I Can&quot; with her father, Kim Bullard, who also produced the album. Rose additionally worked with songwriters including Stuart Mathis, Holly Mathis, River Jones, Billy Mohler, and Danny Dunlap. &quot;Because I Can&quot;″s lyrical themes revolve around depression, rebellion, and innocence.

The album was supported by two singles, &quot;Overdrive&quot; and &quot;I Like&quot;. The former, being the lead single from the record, became Rose&#x27;s most chart successful single to date, peaking at 37 on the US Adult Top 40 chart. The song was also featured in the 2004 film and movie soundtrack of &quot;Mean Girls&quot;. Furthermore, despite not being released as a single, the album track &quot;Lemon&quot; would be featured in the 2003 film and movie soundtrack of &quot;Thirteen&quot;.

On August 20, 2015, Rose announced in a Twitter post that she plans to remaster and reissue the album with the inclusion of an additional song.

==Background==

As a teenager, Rose performed in an all-female punk rock band named Ruby Red Slipper, that predominately performed covers of popular rock songs. Some of these songs include covers of those performed by Hole and Weezer. However, the group also wrote and performed a few original songs, which Rose credits as having been a &quot;good songwriting lesson&quot; in preparation for the writing process of her debut record. One of the songs written by Rose while in the group was &quot;License to Thrill,&quot; which was released as a B-side to the record&#x27;s second single, &quot;I Like,&quot; in addition to being featured on the original soundtrack for &quot;Going the Distance&quot;.

Rose began seriously composing songs in 2001 as a creative outlet for herself, with the songs grabbing the attention of several music executives. One of these songs, titled &quot;Mermaid Jane,&quot; ultimately secured Rose a record deal at V2 Records. After being signed, Rose spent the next three years composing her debut effort in collaboration with her father, pianist and songwriter Kim Bullard, who would ultimately produce the entire album. Rose states that the recording sessions with her father went smoothly, outside of a few lyrics which caused &quot;serious consternation&quot; between them. The first song written for the album was the title track, &quot;Because I Can,&quot; which Rose wrote when she was twelve years old. The album focuses on themes of depression, rebellion, innocence and Rose&#x27;s coming of age. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Rose asserted that she strived to be as honest as possible in her songs and that the album acted as a &quot;way of asking for help without [actually] asking for help&quot;.

When speaking to &quot;Today&quot;, Rose vented her frustration with the success of Avril Lavigne&#x27;s 2002 effort &quot;Let Go&quot;, as she felt that she would be compared to Lavigne upon the release of &quot;Because I Can&quot;. Rose stated that &quot;it made me angry at first when Avril came out. I&#x27;m not like a competitive person, but suddenly I was starting to be called another Avril ... it just kind of made me angry that she didn&#x27;t have to go through the [stuff] that I did to make it&quot;.

== Promotion and release ==
In 2003, Rose would release a promotional recording titled &quot;Sampler&quot;, which featured the songs &quot;Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Vacation&quot;, &quot;Catch My Fall&quot; and &quot;I Like&quot;. In the United States, pressings of the recording also featured the song &quot;Teachin&#x27; Myself to Dream&quot;.

Prior to the release of the record, Rose embarked on a slew of promotional interviews and performances, including with publications and programs such as &quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Total Request Live. Rose also had several songs featured on soundtracks in the lead up to the album. In 2003, the song &quot;Lemon&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Thirteen,&quot; while &quot;Teachin&#x27; Myself to Dream&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot;. The following year in 2004, the outtake &quot;License to Thrill&quot; and lead single &quot;Overdrive&quot; were featured on the soundtracks to the films &quot;Going the Distance&quot; and &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Overdrive&quot;, the first single from the album, was produced by Kim Bullard and was released on October 21, 2003. The song would go on to chart on the US Adult Top 40 for six weeks, peaking at number 37. The single would also peak at 8 on the New Zealand RIANZ single chart. The physical release of the single included the b-side &quot;Lemon&quot;. Furthermore, the single would be featured in the film &quot;Mean Girls&quot; in addition to the film&#x27;s respective soundtrack. The second and final single from the album was &quot;I Like&quot;. The single failed to have any chart impact globally. The physical release of the single included two b-sides, being &quot;License to Thrill&quot; and a cover of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;.

==Touring==
In an effort to support &quot;Because I Can&quot;, Rose embarked on the Chicks with Attitude Tour in 2004. The tour had 19 North American tour dates, launching on August 4 in Chicago and concluding on September 3 in Washington D.C. Maybelline sponsored the tour, in which the company promoted their relaunch through having the Maybelline logo appear on signage and offering makeovers at tour venues. When asked about the Maybelline sponsorship, Rose stated that she is grateful for the support as &quot;some people tour without [a marketing vehicle], but that means less ads and less money&quot;. Throughout the course of the tour, Rose performed alongside other acts such as Liz Phair, The Cardigans lead singer Nina Persson, and Charlotte Martin.

The promotion of &quot;I Like,&quot; the second single from &quot;Because I Can&quot;, was a focal point for Rose on the tour. The song was often used as the opening song for Rose&#x27;s setlist, with Rose declaring that the track is &quot;a very powerful song&quot;. However, despite this promotion, the song failed to gain traction.

== Reception ==

&quot;Because I Can&quot; garnered mixed reviews from music critics. Aaron Latham of AllMusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, stating that the album &quot;delivers a set of pop/rockers that are lyrically convincing, musically sound, and a step above most anything by Avril Lavigne, someone she will inevitably be compared to in age and attitude&quot;. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; also gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;overproduced,&quot; describing the effort as &quot;effectively [bottling] female teen angst into tidy four-and-a-half minute blocks&quot;. Susanne Ault of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine asserted that the record often &quot;meanders into bland pop territory,&quot; but praised Rose&#x27;s &quot;enviable pipes&quot; on the album. Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; criticized the record&#x27;s production and vocals, stating &quot;if only the neo-new-wave production and Rose&#x27;s conversational vocals had as much sass [as her lyrics]&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; praised the effort, asserting that Rose&#x27;s music is &quot;as catchy as can be, if not a little catchier [than her Top 40 contemporaries]. But unlike them, she’s indisputably the real deal&quot;.

Rose responded to the mixed criticism of &quot;Because I Can&quot; in a written journal entry on her website. Rose urged music critics and listeners to focus on &quot;my words... lyrics... poetry...etc...,&quot; as opposed to solely focusing on her public image. She also wrote about how she was cognizant that she would receive this type of criticism, maintaining that &quot;the more successful one gets, the more anxious people are to knock them down&quot;.

<text>POPFile is an abandoned free, open-source, cross-platform mail filter originally written in Perl by John Graham-Cumming and maintained by a team of volunteers. It uses a naive Bayes classifier to filter mail. This allows the filter to &quot;learn&quot; and classify mail according to the user&#x27;s preferences. Typically it is used to filter spam mail. It can also be used to sort mail into other user defined &quot;buckets&quot; or categories - for example, the user may define a bucket into which work email is sorted.

The program works in several different modes. In the most popular mode, it sets itself up as a proxy between the email client and the POP3 server. As mail is downloaded via POP3, the filter identifies and classifies mail and makes a user defined modification to the subject line, appending the name of the appropriate bucket. The user then sets up rules in the mail client to sort the mail based on the subject line modification. An HTML based interface can be used to instruct POPFile, allowing users to correct errors in classifications and thus train the system to be sensitive to the user&#x27;s specific requirements.

As an alternative to the subject-line modification (or as a supplement to it), the system can also be configured to use custom mail headers instead.

In another possible mode, POPFile can work as an IMAP client that monitors an IMAP server for incoming mail and also for messages moved by the user. Incoming emails are categorized and then immediately moved to the folder corresponding to the categorization. To train POPFile in this mode, the user only needs to move the message to the correct folder, i.e. to the folder where POPFile should have moved the message.

<text>An intermediary, also known as a middleman or go-between, is defined differently by context. In law or diplomacy, an intermediary is a third party who offers intermediation services between two parties. In trade or barter, an intermediary acts as a conduit for goods or services offered by a supplier to a consumer, which may include wholesalers, resellers, brokers, and various other services. &quot;Intermediation&quot; refers to a process matching two sides of a market, such as buyers and sellers by an third party such as a broker, agent, or wholesaler. The most common example of intermediation is in the finance industry, where it involves the matching of lenders with borrowers by a bank.

==Diplomacy==
In diplomacy and international relations, an intermediary may convey messages between principals in a dispute, allowing the avoidance of direct principal-to-principal contact. Where the two parties are geographically distant, the process may be termed shuttle diplomacy. Where parties do not want formal diplomatic relations, an intermediary state may serve as a protecting power facilitating diplomacy without diplomatic recognition. In law enforcement in Mexico, the concept of intermediary has emerged with the &quot;Autodefensas&quot;, a self-governing protective association of citizens, which brokers in the struggles of the state with violent, criminal organizations known as cartels.

==Law==
In law, the job of an intermediary involves conveying messages between principals in a dispute, preventing direct contact and potential escalation of the issue. In law, intermediaries can facilitate communication between a vulnerable witness, defendant and court personnel to acquire valuable evidence. Intermediaries can facilitate communication between a vulnerable witness or defendant and court personnel to acquire valuable evidence and to ensure all parties have a fair trial. 

==Trade and finance==
In trade, an intermediary middleman or commercial agent acts as a conduit for goods or services offered by a supplier to a consumer. Typically the intermediary offers some added value to the transaction which may not be possible by direct trading. Examples of intermediaries are wholesalers and resellers. 

Common usage includes the insurance and financial services industries where e.g. mortgage brokers, insurance brokers, and financial advisers offer intermediation services in the supply of financial products such as mortgage loans, insurance, and investment products. In relation to energy supplies, third party intermediaries provide energy-related advice, assistance in purchasing energy and management of energy needs. In a wider sense, an intermediary can be a person or organization who or which facilitates a contract between two other parties. The interests of commercial agents are protected by legislation such as the EU&#x27;s Directive 86/653/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the coordination of the laws of the Member States relating to self-employed commercial agents, as implemented within each EU member state. This directive specifically notes that a &quot;commercial agent&quot; is an &quot;intermediary&quot; with continuing authority to negotiate on behalf of another person. Regulations implementing the directive cover the rights and duties of the principal and the commercial agent, the agent&#x27;s remuneration, and both parties&#x27; continuing obligations after the termination of the contract between them. UK law specifies that neither principals nor agents may derogate from their duties as set out in the regulations.

The internet is creating opportunities to automate the role of an intermediary in many industries.

Trading intermediaries can be classified as merchant intermediaries or as accountant intermediaries. Bailey and Bakos (1997) analyzed a number of case studies and identified four roles of electronic intermediaries including information aggregating, providing trust, facilitating and matching.

In financial intermediation, If the matching of lenders and borrowers is successful, the lender obtains a positive rate of return, the borrower receives a return for risk taking and entrepreneurship and the banker receives a return for making the successful match. If the borrower&#x27;s speculative play with the funds provided by the bank does not pay off, the bank can face significant losses on its loan portfolio, and if the bank fails its depositors can lose some of their money if the deposits are not insured by a third party.

The skill of identifying potential successful new entrepreneurs who can take market share off competitors or develop whole new markets is one of the most vital (and intangible) skills any banking system can possess. An unexpected form of entrepreneurship, and unintended consequence of microfinance initiatives, can be informal intermediation. That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to &#x27;loan sharks&#x27; at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.

Disintermediation occurs when potential lenders and borrowers interact more directly in the capital markets, avoiding the intermediation of banks.

In barter, the intermediary is a person or group who stores valuables in trade until they are needed, parties to the barter or others have space available to take delivery of them and store them, or until other conditions are met.

The electoral district was created in 2003: 86.1% of the riding came from Northumberland riding and 13.9% from Prince Edward—Hastings riding.

==Federal electoral redistribution==

Following the passage of the Fair Representation Act on December 16, 2011, an additional 30 seats were added to the Canadian House of Commons.

The boundary changes first proposed for Northumberland—Quinte West would have seen significant changes to the riding. The County of Northumberland, while still composing a majority of the riding, was to not be reflected in the new name. Instead, the new electoral district was to be called Prince Edward-Quinte West. Furthermore, the town of Cobourg, township of Hamilton, and municipality of Port Hope was to be transferred to the new riding of Kawartha Lakes-Port Hope-Cobourg. Under the proposed riding changes, Northumberland County would have been split into two separate ridings. The Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for Ontario defined the proposed boundaries of Prince Edward-Quinte West as consisting of:

* the City of Prince Edward;
* the City of Quinte West; and
* the County of Northumberland, excepting: the Township of Hamilton; the Town of Cobourg; the Municipality of Port Hope.

The proposed boundary changes would also have reduced the overall population of the riding. The current electoral district of Northumberland—Quinte West had a population of 125,261 people whereas the proposed riding of Prince Edward-Quinte West would have had a population of 105,035.

The elimination of the word &quot;Northumberland&quot; in the proposed riding was the source of heavy criticism. Critics argue that the division of Northumberland County into two distinct political districts as well as the loss of the county&#x27;s name in the riding title would have had significant negative impacts on the community. &quot;The proposed changes will have significant negative impacts on the future prosperity of Northumberland County by eliminating the name Northumberland completely from the electoral map,&quot; Trent Hills Mayor Hector Macmillan said in an interview with Northumberland Today. Furthermore, Bill Pyatt, CAO of Northumberland County Council, said the proposed boundary changes to area electoral districts &quot;will have significant negative impacts on the future prosperity of Northumberland County.&quot;

Widespread dissatisfaction with the proposed boundaries caused the online petition 1NORTHUMBERLAND to circulate in an attempt to keep Northumberland in the name and united under one electoral district. As The petition had the support of at least 800 households in the riding, representing about 2,000 people. The petition was submitted to the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for Ontario.

The Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for Ontario held a public hearing on November 12, 2012 to receive input on the proposed boundary changes. Member of Parliament for Northumberland—Quinte West, Rick Norlock, Cramahae Township Mayor Marc Coombs, former MPP Lou Rinaldi, and past president of the Northumberland Federation of Agriculture, Paul Burnham all spoke against the commission&#x27;s proposed boundary changes.

Northumberland County Council CAO, Bill Pyatt, presented two alternatives to the commission&#x27;s boundary proposal. The first alternative would see Northumberland County join the Township of Cavan-Millbrook-North Monaghan and Clarington&#x27;s Ward 4 to create the riding of &quot;Northumberland-Pine Ridge&quot; with an approximate population of 107,000. The second alternative would see Northumberland and the Townships of Asphodel-Norwood, Otonabee-South Monaghan and Cavan-Millbrook-North Monaghan become the riding of &quot;Northumberland-South Peterborough&quot;, with an approximate population 106,000. It was believed that the population figures would be in line with Commission&#x27;s goal to reduce riding populations.

The Commission accepted these criticisms and restored Northumberland County&#x27;s riding as Northumberland—Pine Ridge, which was later renamed Northumberland—Peterborough South.

<text>The Royal School of Mines comprises the departments of Earth Science and Engineering, and Materials at Imperial College London. The Centre for Advanced Structural Ceramics and parts of the London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Bioengineering are also housed within the building. The school as an organisation no longer exists, having been incorporated into the Faculty of Engineering since 2003. Today the Royal School of Mines refers to both the departments associated with the former school, and the Grade II listed Edwardian building by Sir Aston Webb, which is viewed as a classic of academic architecture. The building and relevant student union still carry the name.

== History ==
The Royal School of Mines was established in 1851, as the Government School of Mines and Science Applied to the Arts. The School developed from the Museum of Economic Geology, a collection of minerals, maps and mining equipment made by Sir Henry De la Beche, and opened in 1841. The museum also provided some student places for the study of mineralogy and metallurgy. Sir Henry was the director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and when the collections outgrew the premises the museum and the survey were placed on an official footing, with government assistance.

The Museum of Practical Geology and the Government School of Mines and Science Applied to the Arts opened in a purpose-designed building in Jermyn Street in 1851. The officers of the Geological Survey became the lecturers and professors of the School of Mines. The Royal College of Chemistry was merged into it in 1853. The name was changed in 1863 to the Royal School of Mines, and was moved to South Kensington in 1872. In 1907, the school was incorporated into Imperial College of Science and Technology, but retained its own identity as a &quot;constituent college&quot;.

In 2001 it was announced Imperial was to transition from a constituent college structure to a faculty structure, a move that was completed in 2003. The last Dean of the Royal School of Mines was Professor John Monhemius before the position was abolished. The Royal School of Mines has since come to refer to both the building in which former school was housed, as are its departments still today, and the student body representing students within those departments.

== Building ==

Designed by Sir Aston Webb, the RSM building is classical in style with ionic pilasters. It was erected between 1909 and 1913 specifically to house the school, which was previously resident in the Huxley Building on Exhibition Road, now the Henry Cole Wing of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The foundation stone was laid by King Edward VII on 8 July 1909.

The RSM was the last of many buildings that Webb designed for the Albertopolis area (including the Cromwell Road frontage of the V&amp;A) and, some would argue, his least resolved. Constructed in Portland stone, the entrance is formed by a three-storey, semicircular niche, flanked by two memorials (sculpted by Paul Raphael Montford, 1916–1920) to Alfred Beit and Julius Wernher who were major benefactors to the school. The western wing of the building is named after Webb, while the eastern end is named after the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company who helped to finance the building of the RSM.

=== In film ===
The distinctively Edwardian and academic styling cues used in the building&#x27;s architecture have led to the RSM appearing in a number of film and television productions:
* 1965: &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot;. Directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Michael Caine. The protagonist walks into the RSM and is magically transported to the old Science Museum Library.
* 1993: &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (ITV television). Appeared as the frontage and main entrance of &quot;Imperial College&quot; on &quot;Exhibition Road&quot; (although the RSM is on Prince Consort Road, off Exhibition Road) in the episode &quot;The Underdog&quot;.
* 1995: &quot;Jack and Sarah&quot;. Directed by Tim Sullivan and starring Richard E. Grant. A wedding party exits from the front of the building, pausing for photographs etc. on the steps.
* 1998: &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;. Front entrance to the building is used as a registry office/town hall for a wedding scene.
* 2004: &quot;Hustle&quot; (BBC television). Generic university frontage, briefly seen as an architecture student exits and is then approached by the main characters.
* 2015: &quot;&quot;. Directed by Matthew Vaughn and starring Colin Firth. Exterior and interiors used as the RSM building; subsequently shown to be blown up in a later scene.

==Students&#x27; Union==
The RSM Union represents the interests and organises events for the students studying at the departments associated with the Royal School of Mines. It is part of the wider college union, and has a formal constitution guiding its activities around:
* The furthering of the interests of the members and the status of the RSM
* The promotion of sport within the RSM
* The promotion of interest in all aspects of geology and materials science
* The promotion of social intercourse among its members

The union runs sports teams, societies and events which span the academic year from October to July. The highlight of the sporting and social calendar is the annual Bottle Match against Camborne School of Mines, the second oldest rugby varsity match in the world.

The RSM Union is also responsible for looking after the RSM Mascots, Davy and Clementine II. Davy is a tall, davy lamp, a type of mining lamp, and has been a mascot since 1965. Clementine II is a 1926 Morris T-Type One Ton Truck, bought by the RSM Union in 1960 to replace their previous motorised mascot Clementine I, a 1919 Aveling and Porter Traction Engine.

<text>The Florida House of Representatives is the lower house of the Florida Legislature, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Florida, the Florida Senate being the upper house. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution of Florida, adopted in 1968, defines the role of the Legislature and how it is to be constituted. The House is composed of 120 members, each elected from a single-member district with a population of approximately 180,000 residents. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures, provided by the federal decennial census. Representatives&#x27; terms begin immediately upon their election. 

The Republicans hold a supermajority in the State House with 87 seats; Democrats are in the minority with 33 seats.

==Term limits==
House members are limited to four consecutive terms. In recent years in the Republican majority caucus, each entering class of House members elects a &quot;Speaker-Designate&quot; from the class whom the caucus as a whole commits to supporting as Speaker in six years time.

==Qualifications==
Florida legislators must be at least twenty-one years old, an elector and resident of their district, and must have resided in Florida for at least two years prior to election.

==Legislative session==
Each year during which the Legislature meets constitutes a new legislative session.

===Regular legislative session===
The Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day regular legislative session each year. Regular legislative sessions in odd-numbered years must begin on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March. Under the state Constitution, the Legislature can begin even-numbered year regular legislative sessions at a time of its choosing.

===Special session===
Special legislative sessions may be called by the governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate president and House speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all legislators. During any special session the Legislature may only address legislative business that is within the purview of the purpose or purposes stated in the special session proclamation.

== Past composition of the House of Representatives ==

From 1874 to 1996, the Democratic Party held majorities in the Florida House of Representatives. Following sizable GOP gains in the 1994 election, which significantly reduced the Democratic Party majority in the Florida House, Republicans captured a majority in the 1996 election. The Republican Party has been the majority party since that time in the House.

Additional information on the past composition of the Florida House of Representatives can be found in Allen Morris&#x27;s &quot;The Florida Handbook&quot; (various years, published every two years for many years).

<text>The Democratic Revolutionary Party (, PRD) is a centre-left political party in Panama founded in 1979 by General Omar Torrijos. To date, it has been the party of four Panamian presidents: Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino (1984–1985), Ernesto Pérez Balladares (1994–1999), Martin Torrijos (2004–2009) and Laurentino Cortizo (2019–2024).

==History==
Since its creation, the party had strong ties with the military regime that ruled Panama since the military coup of 1968. Most of its members identified with Torrijos&#x27;s social policy and the legacy of the Canal Treaties signed a few years before his death. Domestic and international political pressure orchestrated by Torrijos against the United States was viewed as nationalist. Despite his aggressive methods, Torrijos is recognized as one of the most popular leaders Panama has ever had.

With the signing of the Canal Treaties, Torrijos committed to restoring at least nominal civilian rule to Panama. To do so, he created the PRD as his political vehicle, and filed to run for president in the 1984 elections against the man he&#x27;d overthrown in 1968, Arnulfo Arias.

With Torrijos&#x27;s death, the military regime ruling the country fell into a crisis of power. After his unclear death, two generals resigned before Manuel Noriega took power. The political scenario changed drastically, and Noriega began to persecute politicians who opposed him, ruling the country by fear and terror.

The situation in the country deteriorated under Noriega&#x27;s rule. The 1985 assassination of dissident Hugo Spadafora generated the beginning of the political turmoil that ended in 1989 with the US invasion of Panama.

The PRD was manipulated by Noriega. There were many secretaries of the party, the most famous being Ramito Vasquez Chambonet at the beginning and Darinel Espino the end. Noriega also named presidents, ministries, legislators, and other government positions loyal to him. This created a deep crisis inside the party, which did not have inner democracy until the reforms after the US invasion.

Since democracy was restored in 1990, PRD politicians have restructured the party by increasing member participation and, for the first time, holding primaries to elect representatives for government positions. It was the first party in Panama that underwent such restructuring and was viewed as the most organized and biggest political party in the country. The restructuring was led by Ernesto Perez Balladares, Francisco Sanchez, Mitchell Does, Tomas G. Duque, and Gerardo Gonzalez. In 1991 part of this staff met Arias Calderon, then vice president of Panama, to make clear their interest in forming a political opposition and not a military.

The 1993 PRD presidential nomination election was between Ernesto Perez Balladares and Alfredo Oranges, who won 66% and 33% of the vote respectively. Perez Balladares won the presidential elections against Mireya Moscoso and a PRD-majority legislature in 1994.

The PRD lost the 1999 elections. Differences between Perez Balladares and presidential candidate Martín Torrijos, who also beat Oranges in the inner presidential race, made an unclear political offer for this election that ended with Mireya Moscoso&#x27;s being elected president and the PRD&#x27;s controlling the assembly.

Once the elections finished, the committee led by Perez Balladares resigned, and Martín Torrijos was elected secretary. This period under Martin Torrijos&#x27; leadership was managed by &quot;youngers&quot; who improved well. The political mistakes by Moscoso&#x27;s government opened a path for Torrijos, who easily won the presidential race in 2004.

In the 2004 general election, Martín Torrijos won the presidency with 47.4% of the vote, running as the candidate for the Patria Nueva (&quot;New Fatherland&quot;) electoral alliance between the PRD and the smaller People&#x27;s Party (PP). In the same election, the party won 37.8% of the popular vote and 41 out of 78 seats in the National Assembly of Panama.

The 2008 primaries were won by Balbina Herrera (Party President Member) against Juan Carlos Navarro. The differences between Herrera and Navarro were so deep that they ended with a non-unified party, once again leading the PRD to lose the presidential race led by Balbina Herrera in 2009.

The committee resigned in October 2009, and a new committee was elected on October 18. The elections ended with the election of President Francisco Sanchez Cardenas and Secretary Mitchell Does.

===Navarro and the new PRD===
Starting in late 2012 the PRD began the democratic process of renovating all of their internal political structures, from delegates to executive committee members.

In a fiery and passionate speech in March 2012, Juan Carlos Navarro called for all members to join him and his Ola Azul movement in forming a new PRD to ensure the party&#x27;s victory in the 2014 elections. In August 2012, the 4,200 delegates of the National Congress convened to elect a new executive committee; the result was a decisive victory by Navarro and the Ola Azul movement, which won all 10 seats of the executive committee, with Navarro elected secretary-general. This was the first time in the party&#x27;s history that one candidate was able to win all seats of the executive committee.

Primaries were held in March 2013, with 17 candidates taking part in the process. Juan Carlos Navarro won 95% of the vote and was elected as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 2014 general election.

The 2014 general election saw former vice-president and Panameñista Party candidate Juan Carlos Varela elected President with 39% of the vote. Juan Carlos Navarro and the PRD came a distant third in the general election, this is considered the worst election result in the history of the party. As a result of this, Navarro resigned his post as secretary-general, quickly followed by 4 other members.

A new election was held in order to fill the five vacant spots in the Executive Committee and San Francisco Councilman Carlos Perez Herrera was elected as secretary general. It won the 2019 election with its fielded candidate Laurentino Cortizo becoming president in a close race.

<text>David William Heath (born February 16, 1969) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1998 to 2001 and intermittently throughout the mid-2000s under the ring name Gangrel. He has also made appearances for All Elite Wrestling (AEW).

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1987–1994)===
Heath was trained by Boris Malenko in Florida. When his training was complete, he began performing in various independent promotions in the Florida area. In the Independent Professional Wrestling (IPW) promotion he won the IPW Tag Team Championship, before moving to Stampede Wrestling, where he formed a tag team with Tom Nash known as &quot;The Blackhearts&quot;. Heath and Nash competed under masks as &quot;Destruction&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse&quot; respectively. They won the Stampede International Tag Team Championship as a team.

In the early nineties, the Blackhearts were paired with Nash&#x27;s wife Luna, wrestling in Joel Goodhart&#x27;s Tri-State Wrestling, in Herb Abrams&#x27; Universal Wrestling Federation, and finally Giant Baba&#x27;s All-Japan, where the team split up. During that time, the marriage between Nash and Luna broke up, and Heath and Luna became romantically involved. They eventually married on Halloween 1994. The World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where Luna worked at the time, even broadcast a segment of Luna&#x27;s &quot;Wedding to a Vampire&quot;.

After the demise of the Blackhearts, Heath and Luna developed the Vampire Warrior gimmick, inspired by the movie &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, under which, he wrestled in various promotions, including the Memphis-based United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in 1993 to 1994. Under this moniker, he won the USWA Southern Championship and the &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; Rookie of the Year award in 1993.

===World Wrestling Federation (1993–1995)===
In 1993, Heath received a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation when he faced Kevin Kruger in an unaired match for Wrestling Challenge on June 14 in Columbus, Ohio. In late October 1993, the WWF began a Florida swing to their house show tour, and Heath made several appearances teaming with The Cuban Assassin and Little Louis in six-man matches against The Bushwhackers and Tiger Jackson.

On the February 28, 1994 episode of RAW, Heath made his televised debut for the WWF and lost to Earthquake. He was portrayed as a masked heel and dubbed &quot;The Black Phantom&quot;, working as an enhancement talent against numerous stars, including Earthquake, Razor Ramon, The 1-2-3 Kid, Lex Luger, Bob Holly, Tatanka, Davey Boy Smith, Typhoon and others. His last match was on the July 9, 1995 edition of Wrestling Challenge, where he fell to the 1-2-3 Kid once more.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995, 1997)===
In 1995, Heath appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) for a short period, feuding with Tommy Dreamer over Dreamer&#x27;s affiliation with Heath&#x27;s real-life wife Luna. He made his debut at Barbed Wire, Hoodies &amp; Chokeslams in June 1995.

Heath made a one-night return to ECW when he teamed with Marty Jannetty as they lost to Al Snow and Amish Roadkill on September 27, 1997.

===Various promotions (1996–1998)===
Heath worked in various promotions for the next two years. He worked in the independents throughout the States and mainly in Florida. He returned to USWA in 1996. Also worked in Japan for International Wrestling Association Japan from 1996 to 1997 and Puerto Rico in 1997. In 1998, he worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling. 

===World Championship Wrestling (1997–1998)===
Throughout 1997 and early 1998, Heath appeared as enhancement talent on &quot;WCW Pro&quot; and &quot;WCW Worldwide&quot;, wrestling Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Dean Malenko, and Scotty Riggs in singles matches, and in tag matches, teaming with Todd Griffith and Johnny Boone once each against Public Enemy, and with Michael Nova against The Faces of Fear.

===Return to WWF (1998–2001)===

In 1998, Heath was hired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) due to the support of then writers Bruce Prichard and Vince Russo, who believed in the merit of a vampire gimmick. Heath was given the name Gangrel, which was derived from a vampire clan from the role-playing game &quot;&quot;. The gimmick involved an entrance which saw him rising from a ring of fire on stage, followed by a slow walk to the ring set to a sinister instrumental music theme. He also carried a goblet of &quot;blood&quot; with him and, during his entrance, would stop on the ring steps, take a drink, and spit it into the air.

Gangrel made his TV debut on the August 16, 1998 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, defeating Scott Taylor. He then formed a gothic faction, called The Brood, with Edge and Christian. The Brood became known for their &quot;blood baths&quot;, which involved the lights going out for a moment, and when they came back on, the targeted wrestler being covered in blood. The three temporarily joined up with The Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness faction.

Gangrel got one of his first title shots at the 1999 Royal Rumble. He challenged D-Generation X member X-Pac for his WWF European Championship in a losing effort. He competed in the Royal Rumble match later that night and again the following year.

After splitting from the Ministry, The Brood began a feud with the Hardy Boyz and their manager Michael Hayes. During the feud, Gangrel suddenly turned on Edge and Christian and aligned himself with Matt and Jeff Hardy. He called the group The New Brood. Terri Runnels also began to show interest in the Hardy Boyz, however, and they eventually would win Terri&#x27;s services as a manager, thus dumping Gangrel.

Gangrel became a singles wrestler following the breakup of The New Brood; he was mainly used as a mid carder. In late 1999, he brought in his real-life wife Luna Vachon as his manager until she was fired. Gangrel continued working for the WWF until being taken off the main roster in November 2000 and was released in June 2001.

===Independent circuit (2001–present)===

Heath wrestled for an independent promotion based in Cleveland, Ohio, called New Era Pro Wrestling. He competed in a casket match against NEPW, defeating Gutter.

Heath (as Vampire Warrior) wrestled for North American Wrestling (NAW). As Vampire Warrior, he wrestled in the main event of the ICWA&#x27;s Show &quot;Revolution 5&quot;, losing to Joe Legend in a casket match for the NWA: ICWA France Heavyweight Championship.

In 2009, he was involved with the &quot;Hulkamania&quot; Australian Tour event in Melbourne, Australia. Teaming up with Black Pearl, he lost to The Nasty Boys in an Australian Street Fight. He has also wrestled for Vendetta Pro Wrestling, All Star Wrestling, Territory League, and Busted Knuckle Pro Wrestling.

On January 23, 2010, Gangrel was inducted into the Legends Pro Wrestling &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; by Jack Blaze in Wheeling, West Virginia, at their annual &quot;LPW Over The Edge&quot; event. On May 11 and 12, 2013, he participated in California-based Alpha Omega Wrestling&#x27;s two-day &quot;Pride of the Ring II&quot; supercard in Indio, California. He was defeated in a four-man elimination match the first day and lost an AOW Heavyweight Championship match to Eric Watts on the second.

On May 18, 2013, Gangrel made his debut for Chikara, managing The Day Walkers (Alexandre Barnabus Castle and Mathias Cage) to the second round of the 2013 Tag World Grand Prix.

In August 2013, Gangrel toured Saskatchewan, Canada, with High Impact Wrestling Canada as part of the &quot;Blood Wars&quot; Tour.

On June 6, 2014, at House of Hardcore 4 Gangrel teamed with Joe Caldo and Hurricane Helms to defeat Vik Dalishus, Bill Carr, and Cerebus in a six-man tag team match. On June 7, at House of Hardcore 5 Gangrel teamed with Cerebus and Fungus to defeat Vik Dalishus, Dan Barry and Bill Carr in a six-man tag team match. On June 14, at House of Hardcore 6 Gangrel teamed with Matt Striker to face Rikishi &amp; X-Pac in a losing effort.

In 2013 and 2014 Gangrel appeared with the West Coast Wrestling Connection based in Portland and Salem, Oregon. In 2015, Gangrel appeared for Big Time Wrestling events in Vermont, Maine, and Virginia. He also was a featured competitor for the Las Vegas-based Paragon Pro Wrestling.

On July 18, 2015, in Kitchener, Ontario, Gangrel won the Pure Wrestling Association Ontario championship, defeating EZE Eric Cairnie. He lost the championship the next day to &quot;Reckless&quot; Ryan Swift.

On February 14, 2016, Gangrel appeared for Professional Wrestling Live in Solihull, West Midlands, UK at Kingshurst Labour Club and became the PWL Heavyweight Champion. Gangrel successfully defended this title on two occasions, but was defeated by local wrestler Jamie Firkin &#x27;Johnny Thunder&#x27; on February 25, 2016. After initially defeating Thunder, a sneak attack enabled Thunder to cash in a guaranteed title match contract he held from a previous Money in the Bank match win.

Gangrel appeared at Over the Top Wrestling&#x27;s Eighth Year Anniversary show at The Hangar in Wolverhampton, England on October 28, 2022, where he defeated Mad Kurt.

=== Sporadic WWE appearances (2004, 2007) ===
Gangrel reunited with former Ministry of Darkness member Viscera in 2004, returning as a hired goon of John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield during a feud with The Undertaker. They were defeated by The Undertaker on the September 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On the 15th Anniversary &quot;WWE Raw&quot; special on December 10, 2007, Gangrel participated in a 15-man battle royal, but was eliminated by Al Snow.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2020, 2022, 2024) ===
On November 7, 2020, Gangrel made his debut for All Elite Wrestling at Full Gear during the Elite Deletion match between Matt Hardy and Sammy Guevara, chastising Hardy for his disloyalty when Gangrel mentored him (referring to his time in the New Brood) before making an unsuccessful attempt to aid Guevara. 18 months later, on the May 27, 2022 episode of AEW Rampage, Gangrel would return to AEW to accompany The Young Bucks to ring during a tag team match they had with Jon Cruz and Taylor Rust. Following the match, which saw the Young Bucks victorious, Gangrel was betrayed by The Young Bucks, who attacked him. He would then be rescued by The Hardy Boyz, who he then reunited with and assisted him in attacking Brandon Cutler.

On May 26, 2024 at Double or Nothing, he emerged from beneath the mat to assist former Brood stablemate Adam Copeland in fighting off The House of Black during Copeland&#x27;s barbed wire steel cage match with Malakai Black.

=== Other media ===
In May 2015, Heath appeared uncredited as a prisoner with Crohn&#x27;s disease in &quot;The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)&quot;, starring Dieter Laser and Laurence R. Harvey. He appeared on the 10th episode of the WWE Network series, &quot;The Edge &amp; Christian Show&quot;, released on May 2, 2016. Also in 2015, he was in a music video for rapper SonReal, on the song &quot;For the Town&quot;.

In 2024, Heath starred in The After Dark as leader of the old world vampires. 

==Video games==
==Personal life==
Heath has two children, David Jr. and Donovan, and has been married four times; first to Cheryl Richards from 1988 to 1991, then to fellow wrestler Luna Vachon from 1994 to 2006 (during which he was stepfather to Luna&#x27;s sons Joshua and Van from her previous marriage to Dan Hurd), to Kiara Dillon from 2008 to 2013, and lastly, he married Susan Nelson in February 2022.

His signature fangs are the result of dental implants he received early on in his career with the WWF. It was reported it cost more than $10,000 for each one.

Heath briefly directed pornography, but gave it up because of his concerns that it was going to affect his wrestling career.

<text>Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry (formerly Stormont—Dundas and Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh) is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1968.

==Geography==
The district includes the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, excluding the Township of North Glengarry.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 2003, from the Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh and Glengarry—Prescott—Russell districts. In turn, the Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh district was formed from the Stormont-Dundas district.

Stormont—Dundas was a federal electoral district from 1968 to 1999. The riding was created in 1966 from parts of Stormont and Grenville—Dundas ridings.

It initially consisted of the County of Stormont including the City of Cornwall, and the townships of Williamsburg and Winchester (in the County of Dundas). In 1976, it was redefined to consist of all of the counties of Dundas and Stormont, and the Township of Charlottenburgh in Glengarry County, but excluding the Village of Lancaster. In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the counties of Dundas and Stormont, excluding Akwesasne Indian Reserve No. 59. In 1996, it was redefined to include the Township of Charlottenburgh and Akwesasne Indian Reserve No. 59.

The electoral district&#x27;s name was changed in 1999 to Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh. It was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2004, and in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2007. It consisted of parts of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry: the Township of Charlottenburgh (Glengarry County), the counties of Dundas and Stormont, and Akwesasne Indian Reserve No. 59.

Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry was created in 2003: 91.5% of it came from Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, and 4.9% from Glengarry—Prescott—Russell ridings.

This riding was unchanged during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, this riding will be renamed Stormont—Dundas—Glengarry at the first election held after approximately April 2024. It will gain North Glengarry from Glengarry—Prescott—Russell in the process.

<doc id="633645" wikidata="Q76728" url="?curid=633645" title="Christopher Clavius">
<text>Christopher Clavius, (25 March 1538 – 6 February 1612) was a Jesuit German mathematician, head of mathematicians at the , and astronomer who was a member of the Vatican commission that accepted the proposed calendar invented by Aloysius Lilius, that is known as the Gregorian calendar. Clavius would later write defences and an explanation of the reformed calendar, including an emphatic acknowledgement of Lilius&#x27; work. In his last years he was probably the most respected astronomer in Europe and his textbooks were used for astronomical education for over fifty years in and even out of Europe.

==Early life==
Little is known about Christopher Clavius&#x27; early life, with the only certain fact being that he was born in Bamberg in either 1538 or 1537. His given name is not known to any great degree of certainty—it is thought by scholars to have perhaps been &quot;Christoph Clau&quot; or &quot;Klau&quot;. There are also some who think that his taken name, &quot;Clavius&quot;, may be a Latinization of his original German name, suggesting that his name may have been &quot;Schlüssel&quot; (German for &#x27;key&#x27;, which is &quot;clavis&quot; in Latin).

Clavius joined the Jesuit order in 1555. He attended the University of Coimbra in Portugal, where it is possible that he had some kind of contact with the famous mathematician Pedro Nunes (&quot;Petrus Nonius&quot;). Following this he went to Italy and studied theology at the Jesuit in Rome. He was ordained in 1564, and 15 years later was assigned to compute the basis for a reformed calendar that would stop the slow process in which the Church&#x27;s holidays were drifting relative to the seasons of the year. Using the Prussian Tables of Erasmus Reinhold and building on the work of Aloysius Lilius, he proposed a calendar reform that was adopted in 1582 in Catholic countries by order of Pope Gregory XIII and is now the Gregorian calendar used worldwide.

Within the Jesuit order, Clavius was almost single-handedly responsible for the adoption of a rigorous mathematics curriculum in an age where mathematics was often ridiculed by philosophers as well as fellow Jesuits like Benito Pereira. In logic, Clavius&#x27; Law (inferring of the truth of a proposition from the inconsistency of its negation) is named after him.

He used the decimal point in the goniometric tables of his &quot;astrolabium&quot; in 1593 and he was one of the first who used it in this way in the West.

==Astronomy==

Clavius wrote a commentary on the most important astronomical textbook of the late Middle Ages, &quot;De Sphaera&quot; of Johannes de Sacrobosco. The commentary by Clavius was one of the most influential astronomy textbooks of its time and had at least 16 editions between 1570 and 1618, with Clavius himself revising the text seven times and in each case greatly expanding it.
In the 1585 edition of his aforementioned commentary he located (independently of Tycho Brahe) the nova from 1572 in the fixed stars sphere (in the constellation of Cassiopeia) and found that the position of the nova was exactly the same for all observers. That meant that it had to be beyond the Moon, and the doctrine that the heavens could not change was proven false.

As an astronomer Clavius adhered strictly to the geocentric model of the solar system, in which all the heavens rotate about the Earth. Though he opposed the heliocentric model of Copernicus, he recognized problems with the Ptolemaic model. He was treated with great respect by Galileo, who visited him in 1611 and discussed the new observations being made with the telescope; Clavius had by that time accepted the new discoveries as genuine, though he retained doubts about the reality of the mountains on the Moon and said he could not see the four Jupiter&#x27;s satellites through the telescope. Later, a large crater on the Moon was named in his honor.

== Collegio Romano ==
During his time at Collegio Romano Clavius served as the head of the mathematicians, a public professor of mathematics, and as the Director of Advanced Instruction and Research at the Academy of Mathematics until 1610 in an official capacity and for two more years until 1612 in an informal role. The Academy existed in an informal capacity for many years before Clavius&#x27; arrival in Rome in 1561. However, in 1580 in his document titled &quot;Ordo servandus in addiscendis disciplinis mathematicis,&quot; Clavius described a detailed curriculum for mathematics to have the College officially recognize the Academy.

The curriculum he proposed contained three different curricula aiming to educate new Jesuits in mathematics. The curriculum contained three different courses: one year, a two-year, and a three-year. The course material to be covered were optics, statics, astronomy, and acoustics, emphasizing mathematics.

His request was eventually denied, but nonetheless he was given the title of Professor of Mathematics. Clavius made another attempt in 1586 to establish the Academy as an official course at the Collegio Romano, but there was opposition from the philosophers at the College. The Academy remained an unofficial curriculum until 1593 or 1594.

Upon its eventual founding, the Academy required nomination by the Professor of Mathematics for admission. Clavius taught the advanced course within the Academy, but little is known about his specific teachings and work as a professor during his time at the College. The exact number of students that Clavius taught is unclear, but in a letter from Christoph Grienberger to Clavius in 1595, it is stated that at that time, Clavius had around ten students. The exact structure of the courses and how they were taught is unclear. There has been no evidence to show whether the students he taught shared classes or the specific material he chose to cover. The purpose for founding the Academy was to train technical specialists, to expand the pedagogical corps to support the growing need for professors, as the number of colleges at the time was rapidly increasing, as well as the training of missionaries in order to support their efforts in remote places. With the purpose of the Academy clear, most of what Clavius and his students did in the Academy is unknown. This lack of detailed information has led to most of what Clavius did during his years at the College falling into obscurity.

Clavius and Galileo Galilei often shared correspondence during his time at the College, discussing proofs and theories. It is likely that while running the Academy, he was also writing to Galileo and sharing his notes from the College&#x27;s logic course to help Galileo in his endeavors to be able to adequately explain and demonstrate his ideas to others, which is something Galileo had struggled with in the past, specifically when trying to convince Clavius of his methods.

Following his death in 1612, informal courses in the Academy continued at the College. However, due to the lack of mention of mathematicians in the College&#x27;s catalog after 1615, it appears the Academy&#x27;s official recognition by the Collegio Romano ended soon after Christopher Clavius&#x27;s death.

<doc id="633652" wikidata="Q310932" url="?curid=633652" title="Ray Winstone">
<text>Raymond Andrew Winstone (; born 19 February 1957) is an English television, stage, and film actor with a career spanning five decades. Having worked with many prominent directors, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, Winstone is perhaps best known for his &quot;hard man&quot; roles, usually delivered in his distinctive London accent. The first of these was &quot;That Summer!&quot; (1979), for which he received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer. He rose to prominence starring as Will Scarlet in the series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; from 1984 to 1986. 

Winstone received a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination for his performance in &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot; (1997). He also starred in the British independent films &quot;Scum&quot; (1979), &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1979), &quot;The War Zone&quot; (1999), &quot;Last Orders&quot; (2001), and &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2010). Winstone&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; (2000), &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; (2002), &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003), &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004), &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006), &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2007), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011), &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; (2012), &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021), and &quot;Damsel&quot; (2024).

== Early life and education ==
Winstone was born on 19 February 1957 in Hackney Hospital, London. He first lived in Caistor Park Road, Stratford E15, and attended Portway infants and junior school. He moved to Enfield when he was seven. His mother, Margaret (née Richardson; 1932–1985) had a job emptying fruit machines, and his father, Raymond J. Winstone (1933–2015), ran a fruit-and-vegetable business. 

Winstone has recounted how, as a child, he used to play with his friends on bomb sites (empty plots of land with rubble from Second World War bombs). He joined Brimsdown Primary School and in 1968, enrolled to Edmonton County School, which had changed from a grammar school to a comprehensive upon his arrival. He also attended Corona Theatre School. He did not take to school, eventually leaving with a single CSE (grade 2) in drama. 

He recounted an early encounter with a notorious gangster:
Winstone had an early affinity for acting; his father would take him to the cinema every Wednesday afternoon. Later, he viewed Albert Finney in &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, and said: &quot;I thought, &#x27;I could be that geezer&#x27;.&quot; His other major influences included John Wayne, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson. After borrowing extra tuition money from a friend&#x27;s mother, a drama teacher, Winstone took to the stage, appearing as a Cockney newspaper seller in a production of &quot;Emil and the Detectives&quot;.

Winstone was also a boxer. Known to his friends as Winnie, he was called Little Sugs at home (his father already being known as Sugar, after Sugar Ray Robinson). At the age of 12, Winstone joined the Repton Amateur Boxing Club. Over the next 10 years, he won 80 out of 88 bouts. He was London schoolboy champion at welterweight on three occasions, and fought twice for England. The experience gave him a perspective on his later career: &quot;If you can get in a ring with 2,000 people watching and be smacked around by another guy, then walking onstage isn&#x27;t hard.&quot;

Deciding to pursue drama, Winstone enrolled at the Corona Stage Academy in Hammersmith, when he was aged &quot;about 17&quot;. At £900 a term, it was expensive considering the average wage was then about £36 a week.

=== &quot;Scum&quot; ===
Winstone was not popular with the establishment at his secondary school, who considered him a bad influence. When he discovered that he was the only pupil not invited to the Christmas party, he decided to take revenge for this slight. Hammering some pins through a piece of wood, he placed it under the wheel of his headmistress&#x27;s car and blew out the tyre, for which he was expelled. As a joke, he went up to the BBC, where his schoolmates were involved in an audition, and got one of his own by flirting with the secretary. The audition was for one of the most notorious plays in history – Alan Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Scum&quot; – and, because Clarke liked Winstone&#x27;s cocky, aggressive boxer&#x27;s walk, he got the part, though it had been written for a Glaswegian.

The play, written by Roy Minton and directed by Clarke, was a brutal depiction of a young offender&#x27;s institution. Winstone was cast in the leading role of Carlin, a young offender who struggles against both his captors and his fellow cons to become the &quot;Daddy&quot; of the institution. Hard hitting and often violent (particularly during the infamous &quot;billiards&quot; scene in which Carlin uses two billiard balls stuffed in a sock to beat one of his fellow inmates over the head), the play was judged unsuitable for broadcast by the BBC, and was not shown until 1991. The banned television play was entirely refilmed in 1979 for cinematic release with many of the original actors playing the same roles, including Winstone. In a commentary for the &quot;Scum&quot; DVD, Winstone cites Clarke as a major influence on his career and laments the director&#x27;s death in 1990 from cancer.

While Winstone has portrayed many characters who share the &quot;hard man&quot; nature of his performance in &quot;Scum&quot;, he has also explored a variety of other roles, including comedy (&quot;Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence&quot;) and as the romantic lead (&quot;Fanny and Elvis&quot;). His favourite role was Henry VIII in the 2003 TV serial of the same name, remarking at the time: &quot;It&#x27;s really flattering for me to be asked to play a king. I mean, I&#x27;m a kid out of Plaistow, and I&#x27;m playing one of the most famous kings of England. It&#x27;s fantastic!&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1970–1988 ===
In 1975, Winstone landed his first professional role in &quot;What a Crazy World&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Stratford in London. One of his first TV appearances came in the 1976 &quot;Loving Arms&quot; episode of the popular police series &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, where he was credited as &quot;Raymond Winstone&quot; (as he was in &quot;What a Crazy World&quot;) and played a minor part as an unnamed young thug. After a short run in the TV series &quot;Fox&quot; (1980), and a role in &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains&quot; (1982), alongside Diane Lane and Laura Dern. He starred in the opening episode of the third season of &quot;Bergerac&quot; (1983), as Will Scarlet in &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;. He again teamed up with Jason Connery in a film which also featured Amanda Donohoe and Maria Whittaker, in &quot;Tank Malling&quot; (1984). 

Over the years, he has appeared in many TV shows, including &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;Fairly Secret Army&quot; (as Stubby Collins), &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;, &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, ‘’Home To Roost, (Se4, Ep6)’’, &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;, &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot;, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, and &quot;Get Back&quot; (with the fledgling Kate Winslet). During this period, he was increasingly drawn to the theatre, playing in &quot;Hinkemann&quot; in 1988, &quot;Some Voices&quot; in 1994, and &quot;Dealer&#x27;s Choice&quot; and &quot;Pale Horse&quot; the following year. Ray also added his London accent to a dance track in 1982 by Marsha Raven called &quot;I Like Plastic&quot;.

=== 1990–2003 ===
Winstone was asked to appear in &quot;Mr Thomas&quot;, a play written by his friend and fellow Londoner Kathy Burke. The reviews were good, and led to Winstone being cast, alongside Burke, in Gary Oldman&#x27;s drama &quot;Nil By Mouth&quot; (1997). He was widely lauded for his performance as an alcoholic wife-batterer, receiving a BAFTA nomination (17 years after his Best Newcomer award for &quot;That Summer&quot;). He continued to play &quot;tough guy&quot; roles in &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;The War Zone&quot; – the latter especially controversial, as he played a man who rapes his own daughter – but that obvious toughness also allowed him to play loved-up nice-guys in romantic comedies &quot;Fanny and Elvis&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Jimmy Grimble&quot;. In &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, he played a dead man, now a trainee angel, who returns from heaven to help his young son cope with his bereavement which was written by Tony Grounds. In 1995, he played the sinister and mysterious Thane in the comedy drama series &quot;The Ghostbusters of East Finchley&quot;. The series was also written by Grounds, with whom Winstone worked again on &quot;Births, Marriages &amp; Deaths&quot; and &quot;Our Boy&quot;, the latter winning him the Royal Television Society Best Actor Award. They worked together again in 2006 on &quot;All in the Game&quot; where Winstone portrayed a football manager. He did a series of Holsten Pils advertisements where he played upon the phrase &quot;Who&#x27;s the Daddy&quot;, coined in the film &quot;Scum&quot;.

In 2000, Winstone starred alongside Jude Law in &quot;Love, Honour and Obey&quot;. He then played lead role in &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; (2001), which earned him great acclaim from UK and international audiences and brought him to the attention of the American film industry. Winstone plays &quot;Gal&quot; Dove, a retired and happily married former thief dragged back into London&#x27;s underworld by a psychopathic former associate (Ben Kingsley, who received an Oscar nomination for his performance). In 2000, he starred in &quot;To the Green Fields Beyond&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse and directed by Sam Mendes. In 2002, he performed at the Royal Court as Griffin in &quot;The Night Heron&quot;. Two years later, he joined Kevin Spacey for &quot;24 Hour Plays&quot; at the Old Vic, a series of productions that were written, rehearsed, and performed in a single day.

After a brief role alongside Burke again in the tragi-comic &quot;The Martins&quot; (2001), he appeared in &quot;Last Orders&quot; (2001), where he starred alongside Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, David Hemmings, and Tom Courtenay. Next, Winstone got a prime part in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; (2002), the semisequel to &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, in which he once again played a gangster. He followed up with &quot;Lenny Blue&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Tough Love&quot;, and the short &quot;The Bouncer&quot;. Now internationally known, Winstone was next chosen by Anthony Minghella to play Teague, a sinister Home Guard boss in the American Civil War drama &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003).

=== 2004–2012 ===

At this time, Winstone set up Size 9 and Flicks production companies with his longtime agent Michael Wiggs. The first effort was &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, in which he plays a businessman whose young daughter disappears in Istanbul (filming was held up by unrest in the Middle East). He followed it up with &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, in which he played poet and visionary William Blake. Winstone made his action-film debut in &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004), starring Clive Owen, directed by Antoine Fuqua, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Fuqua lauded his performance, proclaiming he was &quot;the British De Niro&quot;. Winstone provided the voice of Soldier Sam in the screen version of &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. In 2005, he appeared opposite Suranne Jones in ITV drama &quot;Vincent&quot; about a team of private detectives. He returned to the role in 2006 and was awarded an International Emmy. He also portrayed a 19th-century English policeman trying to tame the Australian outback in &quot;The Proposition&quot;. In 2006, American critic Roger Ebert described Winstone as &quot;one of the best actors now at work in movies&quot;.

A complete change of pace for Winstone occurred when he provided the voice for the cheeky-chappy Mr. Beaver in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, also in 2005. Winstone appeared in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;The Departed&quot; as Mr. French, an enforcer to Jack Nicholson&#x27;s Irish mob boss. Critic Roger Ebert singled out Winstone for praise among the ensemble cast of &quot;The Departed&quot;, writing that the actor &quot;invests every line with the authority of God dictating to Moses&quot;. He provided motion capture movements and voice-over work for the title character in the Robert Zemeckis&#x27; film &quot;Beowulf&quot;. He then co-starred in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, which was released on 22 May 2008. He returned to television drama in &quot;The Changeling&quot;-inspired &quot;Compulsion&quot;, originally shown in May 2009. Since 2009, Winstone has fronted the advertising for betting firm Bet365. He also co-founded a sports-management business, Integral Sports Management, in 2020.

Winstone has mixed work in Hollywood productions with work in lower-budget, independent films. In 2010, Winstone starred as Arjan van Diemen in the film &quot;Tracker&quot; with Temuera Morrison He had a role as CIA agent Darius Jedburgh in the &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; remake, replacing Robert De Niro. Winstone starred in British independent film &quot;The Hot Potato&quot; in 2011, and the following year in a big-screen remake of popular 1970s show &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (2012).

=== 2013–present ===
In April 2013, while a guest host of the comedy quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, he provoked controversy by stating that Scotland&#x27;s chief exports were &quot;oil, whisky, tartan, and tramps&quot;, leading to a headline in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; claiming, &quot;Ray Winstone calls Scots &#x27;tramps&#x27; on TV quiz show&quot;. Viewers complained to Ofcom and the BBC. In 2015, he played the role of ex-criminal Jimmy Rose in &quot;The Trials of Jimmy Rose&quot;, a three-part drama for ITV. In 2006, Winstone appeared as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car during series 8 of BBC&#x27;s Top Gear.

In 2015, he starred in &quot;The Gunman&quot; with Sean Penn; the film was a box-office failure. That same year, Winstone also featured in remake &quot;Point Break&quot;, a relative box-office success, though critically panned. In 2017, the actor starred in the critically acclaimed British independent film &quot;Jawbone&quot;, before 2018&#x27;s critical and box-office failure &quot;King of Thieves&quot;. In 2019, Winstone starred in critical disaster &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Corgi&quot;, and critical and box-office bomb &quot;Cats&quot;. Winstone then starred in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Black Widow&quot; in 2021. He is currently appearing on Netflix in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s eight-part series, &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Winstone has been described as one of the UK&#x27;s &quot;seminal screen hard nuts&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; has said that he &quot;plays troubled hard men with such conviction, it&#x27;s easy to believe he&#x27;s not acting&quot;, adding that he is &quot;the East End&#x27;s answer to George Clooney&quot;. 

== Personal life ==
Winstone met his wife, Elaine McCausland, while filming &quot;That Summer&quot; in 1979. They have three daughters; the elder two, Lois and Jaime, are actresses. Winstone lives with his wife in Roydon, Essex.

He is a fan of West Ham United and promoted their 2009 home kit. 

Winstone was declared bankrupt on 4 October 1988, and again on 19 March 1993. 

In March 2019, in the context of Brexit, Winstone expressed a preference for leaving the European Union without a deal and argued against holding a second referendum, stating that it would lead to &quot;rebellion&quot; and that &quot;The country voted to leave. Then that&#x27;s democracy, you leave.&quot;

<doc id="633654" wikidata="Q111520068" url="?curid=633654" title="Mary Ann Day Brown">
<text>Mary Ann Day Brown (April 15, 1816 – February 29, 1884) was the second wife of abolitionist John Brown, leader of a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia), which attempted to start a campaign of liberating enslaved people in the South. Married at age 17, Mary raised 5 stepchildren and an additional 13 children born during her marriage. She supported her husband&#x27;s activities by managing the family farm while he was away, which he often was. Mary and her husband helped enslaved Africans escape slavery via the Underground Railroad. The couple lived in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and in the abolitionist settlement of North Elba, New York. After the execution of her husband, she became a California pioneer.

==Early life==
Mary Ann Day was born on April 15, 1816, in Granville in Washington County, New York, to Mary and Charles Day, a farmer and blacksmith. When she was a young girl, she moved with her parents to Meadville in Crawford County, Pennsylvania. 

When she was sixteen, she occasionally came to abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s house in New Richmond, Pennsylvania, to work on the spinning wheel. Her sister was his housekeeper. Mary was described as tall and sturdy, with striking black hair. John found her to be a hard worker and practical. A shy man, John wrote a letter to her in which he asked her to marry him.

==Marriage and children==
At the age of 17, Mary Ann Day was married on June 14 or July 11, 1833, in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, to John Brown, who was a widower previously married to Dianthe Lusk.

===Stepchildren===
Mary acquired five stepchildren, aged two to twelve, upon her marriage to John Brown.

* John Brown, Jr., was born in Hudson, Ohio, on July 25, 1821. He attended the Grand River Institute in Austinburg, Ohio. He attempted to keep accurate records of his father&#x27;s disorganized business proceedings in the 1840s and became a teacher later in life. He married Wealthy Hotchkiss in 1847. As a Captain in a Kansas cavalry unit, he was the only one of the Brown&#x27;s children to serve in the Civil War. He died May 3, 1895.
* Jason Brown was born in Hudson, Ohio, on January 19, 1823. Jason was a humanitarian and a pacifist. He married Ellen Sherbondy in 1847 and they had descendants. He died on December 24, 1912.
* Owen Brown was born in Hudson, Ohio, on November 4, 1824. He participated in the Kansas battles and came with his father to Harpers Ferry. During the raid on Harpers Ferry, he stayed at the Kennedy Farm and led four others to safety when the failure of the raid became apparent. He died in Pasadena, California, on January 8, 1889.
* Ruth Brown was born in New Richmond, Pennsylvania, on February 18, 1829. She also attended the Grand River Institute. She married Henry Thompson on September 26, 1850, and they had descendants. She died on January 18, 1904.
* Frederick Brown (the second) was born in New Richmond, Pennsylvania, on December 31, 1830. He was shot and killed by Martin White in Osawatomie, Kansas, on August 30, 1856, and was buried there.

===Mary&#x27;s own children===
Mary had thirteen children with John. Six of them did not survive to adulthood. Three more died before John&#x27;s death. The children were:
* Sarah Brown was born in New Richmond, Pennsylvania, on May 11, 1834. At age nine, she died in Richfield, Ohio, of dysentery.
* Watson Brown was born in Franklin, Ohio, on October 7, 1835. He married Isabella Thompson in September 1858. He participated in the raid on Harpers Ferry and died on October 19, 1859, of wounds that he sustained.
* Salmon Brown was born in Hudson, Ohio, on October 2, 1836. He married Abbie C. Hinckley in September 1858 and they had descendants. He took part in the Kansas fighting. He died in Portland, Oregon on May 10, 1919.
* Charles Brown was born in Hudson, Ohio, on November 3, 1837. He died in Richmond, Ohio, of dysentery on September 11, 1843 at the age of 5. 
* Oliver Brown was born in Franklin, Ohio, on March 9, 1839. He married Martha Brewster on April 7, 1858. Oliver participated in the raid on Harpers Ferry and died from wounds received there on October 17, 1859.
* Peter Brown was born in Hudson, Ohio, on December 7, 1840. He died of dysentery at age two on September 22, 1843, and was buried in Richfield, Ohio.
* Austin Brown was born in Richfield, Ohio, on September 14, 1842. He died of dysentery at age one, September 27, 1843.
* Annie Brown was born in Richfield, Ohio, on December 23, 1843. She was a lookout at Kennedy Farm before the raid on Harpers Ferry to alleviate concerns of nearby residents. She married Samuel Adams and they had descendants. Annie died October 5, 1926, and was buried in Shively, California.
* Amelia Brown was born June 22, 1845, and was accidentally scalded to death on October 30, 1846. She was buried in Akron, Ohio.
* Sarah Brown (the second) was born in Akron, Ohio, on September 11, 1846. She never married and died in 1916.
* Ellen Brown (the first) was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on April 26, 1848. She died of consumption in her father&#x27;s arms on April 30, 1849.
* Infant son (unnamed) was born in Akron, Ohio, on April 26, 1852, and died of whooping cough 21 days after his birth. 
* Ellen Brown (the second) was born in Akron, Ohio, on September 25, 1854. She married James Fablinger in 1876. She died on July 16, 1916.

==Ohio==
For the first couple of years of marriage, the Browns lived in New Richmond, Pennsylvania. In May 1835, they moved to Franklin Mills, Ohio (later renamed Kent, Ohio), and to Richfield, Ohio, in 1842. At that time, the Browns had twelve living children. They also lived in John&#x27;s home town of Hudson, Ohio, where he had lived from 1805 to 1821.

Anti-slavery institutions were established by William Lloyd Garrison in the early 1830s with the founding of &quot;The Liberator&quot; newspaper and the American Anti-Slavery Society. In the mid-1830s, the Browns were subscribers of the newspaper and Mary was familiar with her husband&#x27;s and Garrison&#x27;s positions against slavery. Few people supported the anti-slavery movement in the 1840s and 1850s. Influenced by the Second Great Awakening, Mary believed it important to bring an end to slavery. She saw African Americans as her equals. 

While her husband and sons were away fighting against slavery, she remained at home and worked to support the family, as well as running her household and delivering and raising children. John considered his wife a partner and a &quot;fast and faithful affectionate friend&quot; who made it possible for him to focus on his fight against slavery. He recognized that she took on a life of &quot;poverty, trials, discredit, and sore afflictions&quot; due to his commitments, which resulted in periods of illness and loss.

Their children were raised to be truthful, resist temptation, improve morally, and be useful. Four of her children died in 1843 and another two children died by 1849. A religious marker was placed in the cemetery at Richfield, Ohio. Believed to have been written by John, the inscription is: &quot;Through all the dreary night of death / In peaceful slumbers may you rest, / And when eternal day shall dawn / And shades and death have past and gone, / O may you then with glad surprise / In God&#x27;s own image wake and rise.&quot; 

In another transition, Mary and the children moved to Akron, Ohio, into a house owned by Simon Perkins, who started a wool business with John in Springfield, Massachusetts, by 1845.

==North Elba colony==
Gerrit Smith established a land-grant colony for African Americans at North Elba, New York, in the Adirondacks wilderness. John Brown moved to the area, with his family, to teach the men how to farm. Having suffered poor health following the death of her children, Mary was described as an invalid by visitor Richard Henry Dana Jr. in 1849. Ruth, her stepdaughter, was taking care of the children at the time. Mary traveled to Northampton, Massachusetts, for a water cure at David Ruggles&#x27; establishment, which greatly improved her health and well-being. Unique for the times, Frederick Douglass found during his visits that the boys and girls of the family served food to family members and visitors. The boys cleared the table and washed the dishes.

John Brown and Gerrit Smith had hoped that the colony would be a place where African Americans could settle. It was difficult, however, to farm in the cold climate and it did not become a thriving community. Lyman Epps and his family were neighbors. A formerly enslaved man, Cyrus, worked for the Browns as a farmhand and lived with the family. The Browns assisted Blacks who were escaping slavery on the Underground Railroad, which became more dangerous with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. John Brown made his wool warehouse in Springfield, Massachusetts, an Underground Railroad site. The Brown family intended to defend North Elba against slavecatchers with weapons.

In the mid-1850s, John and most of their sons went to Kansas to fight pro-slavery factions to make the territory a free state, while Brown stayed in North Elba with her daughters and son Watson. In 1857, Franklin Sanborn commented that Mary and her daughters, Ruth and Annie, were &quot;hardworking, self-denying, devoted women, fully sensible of the greatness of the struggle in which Capt. Brown is engaged, and willing to bear their part in it.&quot; Brown&#x27;s life was one of financial hardship, and yet the family set aside money to aid African Americans in North Elba.

John returned to the east in 1856 and began canvassing for support for an anti-slavery raid in Virginia. Mary was managing the family&#x27;s &quot;hardscrabble&quot; existence in North Elba — as he traveled through Canada and the Northern states.

Mary refused to come to the Kennedy Farm, as her husband requested. She did not answer his request at all, and did &quot;everything in her power&quot; to prevent her stepdaughter Annie and Oliver&#x27;s wife Martha from going in her place.

==Harpers Ferry raid==

John planned and executed the raid on Harpers Ferry on October 16, 1859. He was accompanied by their sons Oliver and Watson. Annie and daughter-in-law Martha (Oliver&#x27;s wife) made preparations and cooked at the Kennedy house for the men who would participate in the raid, who were later called John Brown&#x27;s raiders. The young women returned to North Elba when the raid was imminent.

The night of the raid, Mary waited at their home in North Elba for news about the fate of her husband and sons. With her were four daughters — Ruth, Annie, Sarah, and Ellen — and her daughters-in-law Martha and Bell. Ruth&#x27;s husband, Henry, was injured while working with John and did not participate in the raid.

John was captured and two of their sons were killed. He was charged with murder, inciting a slave riot, and treason. When she visited him in jail in Charles Town, Virginia, Mary&#x27;s likeness was sketched and her life story printed in newspapers. She became a source of interest in the country as the result of the Harpers Ferry raid. Mary met noted abolitionists and funds were raised to help support the family.

Mary was repeatedly tutored by abolitionist leaders (such as Wendell Phillips) about how they thought John Brown&#x27;s wife should behave and speak, to project the image that John had his wife&#x27;s unqualified support. They wrote letters for publication in her name.
Found guilty of all charges, John was hanged on December 2, 1859. There were some plans to use his body for medical research, but Mary implored Henry A. Wise, the governor of Virginia, to return his remains to her and their children for burial at the family farm, as John had requested. Wise agreed. Some abolitionists — like  Wendell Phillips — wanted him to be buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a monument and lavish funeral, that would be a catalyst for fund-raising for the anti-slavery movement.

==California==

After the American Civil War, she and her daughters abstained from drinking and were members of temperance societies in their communities. Mary, her son Salmon, and her daughter-in-law Abbie Hinckley Brown decided to travel to California. Abbie&#x27;s uncle had declared that he found it to be a &quot;land of gold opportunity&quot;. Mary and the couple sold their farms and headed west with her daughters Sarah and Annie, hoping that it would be a fresh start and an escape from John Brown&#x27;s notoriety.

They spent the winter in Iowa and were discovered by Confederate sympathizers who were believed to have poisoned two ewes and planned to kill Salmon. On September 22, 1864, &quot;The New York Tribune&quot; reported that there was an unconfirmed rumor that the Brown family was murdered by Missouri guerillas. Instead, the Browns traveled by wagon to the Union post at Soda Springs, Idaho, arriving three hours before their pursuers. Soldiers traveled with the family to Nevada, a trip. They continued their journey along the California Trail and arrived at Red Bluff, California, where they were welcomed by the residents. They received groceries and supplies and Salmon obtained work immediately after their arrival. She was harassed by pro-slavery people while in Red Bluff and decided to leave the town. She moved to Rohnerville, California, and then Saratoga. 

In 1882, she made a trip east. She was honored at public receptions in Chicago and Kansas, and visited several places associated with her life and that of her husband. While at the house of her son John Jr. in Ohio, the lost body of her son Watson was unexpectedly brought to her, and she took it with her to North Elba, burying him beside his father.

==Death==
Mary Ann Day Brown died on February 29, 1884, and was buried in the Madronia Cemetery in Saratoga, California. She had requested to be buried alongside her husband, if it was not too costly or difficult. Her funeral was heavily attended.

==Legacy==
Historian Stephen B. Oates called her a &quot;loyal, self-sacrificing wife&quot;, and stated, &quot;She had been taught since childhood that a woman&#x27;s task was to bear children, tend her house, and obey her husband. Thus she subordinated herself completely to Brown&#x27;s will... enduring his intractable ways.&quot;

Her correspondence shows that she was devoted to her husband and abolitionism. Author John Newton stated in &quot;Captain John Brown&quot; (1902) that she bore &quot;hardship, poverty, prolonged separation from her husband, yea, even the loss of her noble sons to further the sacred cause of freedom.&quot; Of her husband, Mary stated, &quot;It is only those that are capable of appreciating his motives that can see any beauty in them.&quot;

Oswald Garrison Villard noted in his 1910 biography of her husband that Mary possessed “rugged physical health and even greater ruggedness of nature… was as truly of the stuff of which martyrs are made as was her husband.

Susan Higginbotham deals with Mary in the novel &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Women&quot;.

<doc id="633660" wikidata="Q1070324" url="?curid=633660" title="Cherokee Nation v. Georgia">
<text>&quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831)&quot;, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 1 (1831), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case. The Cherokee Nation asked the Court to stop Georgia from enforcing state laws that took away their rights within the Cherokee territory. However, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the cases&#x27;s merits, stating that it lacked the original jurisdiction, or authority, to decide in a matter between a U.S. state and the Cherokee Nation. Chief Justice John Marshall explained that the Cherokee Nation was not a &quot;foreign nation&quot; but a &quot;domestic dependent nation&quot;, comparing their relationship with the United States to that of a &quot;ward to its guardian.&quot;

This case, part of the Marshall Trilogy, set a precedent for how Native American tribes are treated under federal law and unfolded against the backdrop of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, highlighting the growing tensions over tribal sovereignty. 

== Background ==
=== Historical Context ===
The Cherokee Nation had lived in what is now the southeastern United States for thousands of years. European contact began in 1542 when Hernando de Soto encountered Cherokee villages during his expedition. By the late 17th century, the English began trading with the Cherokee, exchanging goods like firearms for alliances in conflicts such as the Tuscarora War. Over time, the Cherokee integrated European-American culture, transitioning to a commercial hunting and farming lifestyle by the mid-18th century. In 1775, one Cherokee village was described as having 100 houses, each with a garden, orchard, hothouse, and hog pens.Treaties, including the Treaty of Hopewell (1785) and the Treaty of Holston (1791), recognized Cherokee sovereignty and established agreements with the U.S. government.

At the start of the 19th century, the Cherokee controlled about of land in Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. However, the U.S. government began pressuring the tribe to cede their land, particularly after an 1802 agreement promising Georgia that Cherokee lands would be opened to settlers. By 1817, the Treaty of the Cherokee Agency marked the beginning of the Indian Removal era, promising land west of the Mississippi River in exchange for Cherokee homelands. Despite adopting European-American farming practices and creating a written language and governing system, the Cherokee faced increasing encroachments on their land.
=== Cherokee Nation and the Push for Removal ===
By the early 19th century, white settlers, eager to expand into new lands, pressured the federal government to remove Native American tribes, including the Cherokee Nation. This pressure stemmed from promises made in the Compact of 1802, in which the U.S. government agreed to extinguish Cherokee land claims in Georgia. While early policies under President Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe varied in their commitment to large-scale removal, the Cherokee faced growing external pressure despite their efforts to adopt European-American cultural practices, including farming and governance systems. President Thomas Jefferson also began to look at removing the tribe from their lands at this time. Congress voted very small appropriations to support the removal, but policy changed under President James Monroe, who did not favor large-scale removal.

At the same time, the Cherokee were adopting some elements of European-American culture. During this period until 1816, numerous other treaties were signed by the Cherokee. In each, they ceded land to the United States and allowed for roads to be constructed through Cherokee territory, but also kept the terms of the Holston treaty.

In 1817, the Treaty of the Cherokee Agency marked the beginning of a formal push for removal under the Indian Removal Act. The treaty promised an &quot;acre for acre&quot; land trade if the Cherokee would leave their homeland and move to areas west of the Mississippi River. However, by 1819, the Cherokee tribal government prohibited further land cessions, even imposing the death penalty for violations. These measures underscored their resolve to defend their sovereignty and territory, but tensions with the state of Georgia escalated. By the 1820s, most of the Cherokee had adopted a farming lifestyle similar to that of neighboring European Americans.
=== Georgia’s Role and the Rise of Andrew Jackson ===
By the 1820s, Georgia aggressively pursued the removal of the Cherokee, leveraging the 1802 Compact as justification. In 1823, the state government and citizens of Georgia began to push for the removal of the Cherokee Nation. Congress responded by appropriating $30,000 to terminate Cherokee title to land in Georgia.

In the fall of 1823, negotiators for the United States met with the Cherokee National Council at the tribe&#x27;s capital city of New Echota, located in northwest Georgia. Joseph McMinn, noted for being in favor of removal, led the U.S. delegation. When the negotiations to remove the tribe did not go well, the U.S. delegation supposedly resorted to trying to bribe the tribe&#x27;s leaders.

In 1828, the state legislature of Georgia feared the United States would not enforce the removal of the Cherokee people from their historic lands in the state using federal policy. On December 20, 1828, Georgia passed laws stripping the Cherokee of legal protections within the state to ensure their forced removal. 

This state action coincided with the national election of President Andrew Jackson, a long-time proponent of Indian removal. Jackson&#x27;s administration marked a turning point in federal policy, as he openly supported Georgia&#x27;s actions and championed the Indian Removal Act of 1830. 

The Cherokee Nation, led by Principal Chief John Ross, sought to resist Georgia&#x27;s state laws. In January 1829, Chief Ross led a delegation to Washington in January 1829 to resolve disputes over the failure of the US government to pay annuities to the Cherokee and to seek federal enforcement of the boundary between the territory of the state of Georgia and the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s historic tribal lands within that state. Rather than lead the delegation into futile negotiations with President Jackson, Ross wrote an immediate memorial to Congress, completely forgoing the customary correspondence and petitions to the President. Ross found support in Congress from individuals in the National Republican Party, such as senators Henry Clay, Theodore Frelinghuysen, and Daniel Webster, as well as representatives Ambrose Spencer and David (Davy) Crockett. Despite this support, in April 1829, John H. Eaton, the secretary of war (1829–1831), informed Ross that President Jackson would support the right of Georgia to extend its laws over the Cherokee Nation. In May 1830, Congress endorsed Jackson&#x27;s policy of removal by passing the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the president to set aside lands west of the Mississippi River to exchange for the lands of Indian nations in the east. Along with the Indian Removal Act, the Treaty of New Echota was signed in 1835. This agreement stated that the Cherokee got compensation land in Mississippi and 5 million dollars in assistance in exchange for 7 million acres of land in Indian Territory.

Congress’s passage of the Indian Removal Act further emboldened Georgia and the Jackson administration, setting the stage for legal and physical confrontations. Ross and the Cherokee turned to the courts as a last resort, laying the groundwork for significant legal battles, including &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; (1831) and the later &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832).

=== Legacy of Andrew Jackson’s Policies ===
Andrew Jackson’s presidency left a lasting legacy on U.S.-Native relations, solidifying federal support for Indian removal. His policies culminated in the forced displacement of thousands of Native Americans, known as the Trail of Tears, and fundamentally reshaped the legal status of tribes as domestic dependent nations. Jackson’s actions and the Cherokee resistance became pivotal moments in the broader history of U.S. expansion, sovereignty disputes, and Native American rights.

== The Case: Cherokee Nation v. Georgia ==

In June 1830, a delegation of Cherokee led by Chief John Ross and represented by William Wirt, a former United States attorney general in the Monroe and Adams administrations, were selected to bring a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Backed by the supporters of Senators Daniel Webster and Theodore Frelinghuysen, the Cherokee Nation sought an injunction against Georgia. They argued that Georgia&#x27;s state legislation had created laws aimed to &quot;annihilate the Cherokees as a political society.&quot; The Cherokee claimed that Georgia’s actions violated U.S.–Cherokee treaties, the U.S. Constitution, and federal laws regulating interactions with Native tribes. 

Wirt contended that the Cherokee Nation qualified as a &quot;foreign nation&quot; under the Constitution and therefore had standing to sue. He asked the Court to nullify Georgia’s laws extending over Cherokee territory. Georgia countered by arguing that the Cherokee lacked standing as a foreign nation, citing their absence of a constitution and centralized government. Wirt argued that &quot;the Cherokee Nation [was] a foreign nation in the sense of our constitution and law&quot; and was not subject to Georgia&#x27;s jurisdiction. 

Wirt asked the Supreme Court to void all Georgia laws extended over Cherokee lands because they violated the U.S. Constitution, United States–Cherokee treaties, and United States intercourse laws.

The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John Marshall, agreed to hear the case but declined to rule on the merits of the case. The Court determined that the framers of the Constitution did not consider the Indian Tribes as foreign nations but more as &quot;domestic dependent nation[s]&quot; and consequently the Cherokee Nation lacked the standing to sue as a &quot;foreign&quot; nation. 
=== Key Opinions ===
Majority Opinion (Chief Justice John Marshall): Marshall concluded that Indian tribes, while retaining some sovereignty, were not foreign nations in the sense required to bring suit in federal court. He emphasized that the Constitution did not envision tribes as fully independent entities.

Justice William Johnson (Concurring): Johnson described tribes as &quot;nothing more than wandering hordes, held together only by ties of blood and habit, and having neither rules nor government beyond what is required in a savage state.&quot; with no formal governance beyond blood ties and habits, underscoring their perceived lack of status as sovereign entities.

Dissenting Opinion (Justice Smith Thompson, joined by Justice Joseph Story): Thompson argued that the Cherokee Nation was a foreign state based on its ability to self-govern and enter treaties. He held that Georgia&#x27;s laws violated federal treaties and acts of Congress, causing significant harm to the Cherokee. He supported the injunction against Georgia.

== Aftermath and Legacy ==

=== Aftermath ===
One year later, in &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832), the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its stance, ruling that the Cherokee Nation was a sovereign entity. Chief Justice John Marshall emphasized that state laws had no authority within Cherokee territory, as the federal government had recognized Native nations as distinct political communities through treaties. This landmark decision established a critical precedent for federal protection of Native sovereignty.

Despite the ruling, President Andrew Jackson famously refused to enforce it, reportedly saying, “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.” Jackson directed the military to proceed with the removal of the Cherokee Nation, culminating in the Trail of Tears (1838–1839). In the spring of 1838, General Winfield Scott and 7,000 soldiers were sent to remove Cherokees from present-day Oklahoma. Six forts were built to hold captured Cherokees until their removal in October 1838. Over 4,000 Cherokee citizens died during this forced migration to Indian Territory, a tragic event that marked the violent erosion of Native rights and lands.

Today, the Cherokee Nation is primarily located in northeastern Oklahoma, where it was forcibly relocated. It is one of the largest federally recognized tribes in the United States, with over 400,000 enrolled members. The Cherokee Nation maintains a sovereign government and oversees services such as healthcare, education, and economic development for its citizens, continuing to uphold its cultural and political legacy despite historical injustices.

=== Legacy ===
The Supreme Court’s dismissal of the Cherokee Nation’s claims in &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; reflected the limitations of Native sovereignty under U.S. law to set the stage for continued federal and state encroachments on tribal autonomy. However, the subsequent &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; decision has had enduring significance. It remains a cornerstone of legal arguments asserting tribal sovereignty and the federal government’s obligation to honor treaties.

Today, Native sovereignty is recognized as a fundamental principle of U.S. law, though it continues to face challenges. Tribes are considered &quot;domestic dependent nations,&quot; retaining inherent rights to self-governance, control over their lands, and the ability to regulate their members and economic activities. However, conflicts persist over issues like jurisdiction, land rights, and resource management.

Modern Native advocacy often draws on &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; to challenge federal and state policies that infringe on tribal sovereignty. Recent cases, such as &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot; (2020), reaffirmed the principle that treaties with Native nations must be upheld, reinforcing tribal jurisdiction over their historic lands. These rulings highlight the lasting impact of the Cherokee Nation’s legal battles on contemporary interpretations of Native sovereignty.

<text>RMS &quot;Aquitania&quot; was an ocean liner of the Cunard Line in service from 1914 to 1950. She was designed by Leonard Peskett and built by John Brown &amp; Company in Clydebank, Scotland. She was launched on 21 April 1913 and sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York on 30 May 1914. She was given the title of &quot;Royal Mail Ship&quot; (RMS) like many other Cunard ocean liners since she carried the royal mail on many of her voyages. &quot;Aquitania&quot; was the third in Cunard Line&#x27;s &quot;grand trio&quot; of express liners, preceded by and , and was the last surviving four-funnelled ocean liner. Shortly after &quot;Aquitania&quot; entered service, the First World War broke out, during which she was first converted into an auxiliary cruiser before being used as a troop transport and a hospital ship, notably as part of the Dardanelles Campaign.

Returned to transatlantic passenger service in 1920, she operated alongside &quot;Mauretania&quot; and the &quot;Berengaria&quot;. Considered during this period of time as one of the most attractive ships, &quot;Aquitania&quot; earned the nickname &quot;the Ship Beautiful&quot; from her passengers. She continued in service after the merger of Cunard Line with White Star Line in 1934. The company planned to retire her and replace her with in 1940.

However, the outbreak of the Second World War allowed the ship to remain in service for ten more years. During the war and until 1947, she served as a troop transport. She was used in particular to take home Canadian soldiers from Europe. After the war, she transported migrants to Canada before the Board of Trade found her unfit for further commercial service. &quot;Aquitania&quot; was retired from service in 1949 and was sold for scrapping the following year. Having served as a passenger ship for 36 years, &quot;Aquitania&quot; ended her career as the longest-serving Cunard vessel, a record which stood for six years until overtaken by RMS &quot;Scythia&quot;&#x27;s service record of 37 years. In 2004 &quot;Aquitania&quot;&#x27;s service record was pushed into third place when &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; became the longest-serving Cunard vessel. She was nicknamed &quot;The Ship Beautiful&quot; for her interior and &quot;Cunard&#x27;s Old Reliable&quot; for her war service.

== Conception ==

The origins of &quot;Aquitania&quot; lay in the rivalry between the White Star Line and Cunard Line, Britain&#x27;s two leading shipping companies. The White Star Line&#x27;s , and the upcoming were larger than the latest Cunard ships, &quot;Mauretania&quot; and &quot;Lusitania&quot;, by 15,000 gross register tons. The Cunard duo were significantly faster than the White Star ships, while White Star&#x27;s ships were seen as more luxurious. Cunard needed another liner for its weekly transatlantic express service, and elected to copy the White Star Line&#x27;s &quot;Olympic&quot;-class model with a slower but larger and more luxurious ship. The plan for the building of that liner began in 1910, under the leadership of Leonard Peskett. Several draft plans were conceived in order to determine the main axes of what should be the ship for which an average speed of 24 knots was planned. In July of that year, the company launched the construction offers to several shipyards before choosing John Brown and Company, the builder of the &quot;Lusitania&quot;. The company chose &quot;Aquitania&quot; as the name for its new ship in continuity with those of its two previous duo. The three ships were named respectively after the Ancient Roman provinces Lusitania, Mauretania, and Gallia Aquitania.

== Design, construction and launch ==

&quot;Aquitania&quot; was designed by Cunard naval architect Leonard Peskett. She was a one of a kind liner as she did not have an identical sister ship of size and appointments as with &quot;Lusitania/Mauretania&quot; or &quot;Olympic/Titanic&quot;. Peskett drew up plans for a larger and wider vessel than &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; (about longer). With four large funnels the ship would resemble the famous speed duo, but Peskett also designed the superstructure with &quot;glassed in&quot; touches from the smaller , a ship he also designed. Another design feature from &quot;Carmania&quot; was the addition of two tall forward deck ventilator cowlings. Although the ship&#x27;s outward dimensions were greater than that of &quot;Olympic&quot;, her displacement and tonnage were lower. With &quot;Aquitania&quot;″s keel being laid at the end of 1910, the experienced Peskett took a voyage on &quot;Olympic&quot; in 1911 so as to experience the feel of a ship reaching nearly 50,000 tonnes as well as to copy pointers for his company&#x27;s new vessel. Though &quot;Aquitania&quot; was built solely with Cunard funds, Peskett designed her according to strict British Admiralty specifications. &quot;Aquitania&quot; was built in the John Brown and Company yards in Clydebank, Scotland, where the majority of the Cunard ships were built. The keel was laid in the same plot where &quot;Lusitania&quot; had been built, and would later be used to construct , , and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. Just like with &quot;Mauretania&quot;, for the launch the hull was painted in a light grey colour for photographic purposes; a common practice of the day for the first ship in a new class, as it made the lines of the ship clearer in the black-and-white photographs. Her hull was repainted to black in dry dock.
In the wake of the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking, &quot;Aquitania&quot; was one of the first new ships to carry enough lifeboats for all passengers and crew. Eighty lifeboats, including two motorised launches with Marconi wireless equipment, were carried in both swan-neck and newer Welin type davits. There was also a double hull and watertight compartments that were designed to allow the ship to float with five compartments flooded. As required by the British Admiralty, she was designed to be converted into an armed merchant cruiser, and was reinforced to mount guns for service in that role. The ship displaced approximately 49,430 tons, of which the hull accounted for 29,150 tons, machinery 9,000 and bunkers 6,000 tons.

&quot;Aquitania&quot; was launched on 21 April 1913 after being christened by Alice Stanley, the Countess of Derby, and fitted out over the next thirteen months. Notable installations were electrical wiring and decorations. The fitting out was led by Arthur Joseph Davis and his associate Charles Mewès. On 10 May 1914, she was tested in her sea trials and steamed at one full knot over the expected speed. On 14 May, she reached Mersey and stayed at a port there for fifteen days, during which she underwent a final major cleaning and finishing in preparation for her maiden voyage.

== Technical aspects ==

&quot;Aquitania&quot; was the first Cunard liner to have a length in excess of . Unlike some four-funneled ships, such as White Star Line&#x27;s s, &quot;Aquitania&quot; did not have a dummy funnel; each funnel was utilised in venting smoke from the ship&#x27;s boilers.

Steam was provided by twenty-one forced-draft, double-ended Scotch boilers, having eight furnaces each, that were long with diameter of arranged in four boiler rooms. Each boiler room had seven ash expellers with pump capacity of approximately 4,500 tons per hour that could also be used as emergency bilge pumps.

Steam drove Parsons turbines in three separate engine rooms in a triple expansion system for four shafts. The port engine room contained the high pressure ahead (240 tons, long with four stage expansion) and astern turbine (120 tons, long) for the port shaft, the centre room contained two low pressure turbines with ahead and astern capability within single casings ( long, nine expansion stages in ahead turbine, four in astern turbine) for the two centre shafts and the starboard room contained the intermediate pressure ahead turbine ( long) and a high pressure astern turbine (twin of the port high pressure turbine) for the starboard shaft.

The electrical plant, located on G deck below the waterline, consisted of four 400 kW British Westinghouse generator sets generating 225 volt direct current, with emergency power provided by a diesel driven 30 kW generator up on the promenade deck. Power was provided for about 10,000 lamps and about 180 electric motors. She also had brass triple chambered 3 chime steam whistles on the 1st funnel and 2nd funnel.

== Interior and design ==

In 1914, &quot;Aquitania&quot; had the capacity to carry 3,220 passengers (618 First Class, 614 Second Class, 2,004 Third Class). After a refit in 1926, the figure was reduced to 610 in first class, 950 in second class, and 640 in tourist class. Although the original specification mentioned a capacity of 972 crew members, the ship sometimes carried around 1,100.

Although &quot;Aquitania&quot; lacked the lean, yacht-like appearance of running mates &quot;Mauretania&quot; and &quot;Lusitania&quot;, the greater length and wider beam allowed for grander and more spacious public rooms. Her public spaces were designed by the British architect Arthur Joseph Davis of the interior decorating firm Mewès and Davis. This firm had overseen the construction and decoration of the Ritz Hotel in London and Davis himself had designed several banks in that city. His partner in the firm, Charles Mewès, had designed the interiors of the Paris Ritz, and had been commissioned by Albert Ballin, head of Germany&#x27;s Hamburg America Line (HAPAG), to decorate the interiors of the company&#x27;s new liner &quot;Amerika&quot; in 1905.

In the years prior to the First World War, Mewès was charged with the decoration of HAPAG&#x27;s trio of giant new ships, , , and , while Davis was awarded the contract for &quot;Aquitania&quot;. In a curious arrangement between the rival Cunard and Hamburg-Amerika Lines, Mewès and Davis worked apart—in Germany and England respectively and exclusively—with neither partner being able to disclose details of his work to the other. Although this arrangement was almost certainly violated, &quot;Aquitania&quot;″s first-class interiors were largely the work of Davis. The Louis XVI dining saloon owed much to Mewès&#x27; work on the HAPAG liners, but it is likely that having worked so closely together for many years the two designers&#x27; work had become almost interchangeable. Indeed, Davis must be given credit for the Carolean smoking room and the Palladian lounge; a faithful interpretation of the style of architect John Webb.
The second class had a dining room, several lounges, a smoking room, a veranda café, and a gymnasium; many being unique facilities for this class on British ocean liners of the time. The third class had several common areas, a promenade, and three shared bathrooms. The cabins offered great comfort. The first class included eight luxury suites, named after famous painters. A large number of first-class cabins had bathrooms, although not all did. The second-class cabins were larger than average, most being capable of accommodating three people as opposed to the standard four. Her Third Class accommodations were a great expansion in facilities compared to her running mates. While most Cunard liners had their Third Class areas confined forward, aboard &quot;Aquitania&quot; such spaces spanned the full length of the ship, and included several large open areas, three large dining rooms and both open and enclosed promenades.

Over her thirty-five years career, her facilities changed. Examples of this were the addition of a cinema during her refit from 1932 to 1933 and the reorganisation of the tourist class during the 1920s for giving greater comfort to poor passengers.

== Early career and World War I ==
&quot;Aquitania&quot;″s maiden voyage was under the command of Captain William Turner on 30 May 1914 with arrival in New York on 5 June. The voyage and arrival in New York received great attention. Fifteen days earlier, the German liner , being the largest ship in the world at the time, was put into service. In the eye of the press, this maiden voyage was a matter of national prestige. However, this event was overshadowed by the sinking of in Quebec the previous day with over a thousand drowned. However, no passenger cancelled their voyage aboard the &quot;Aquitania&quot;, despite the strong emotion aroused by this sinking. During her maiden voyage, the ship carried around 1,055 passengers, which was about a third of her total capacity. This was because a superstition pushed some people away from travelling on a ship&#x27;s maiden voyage. The crossing fully satisfied the crew and the company. Average speed for the voyage, a distance of measured from Liverpool to the Ambrose Channel lightship, was , taking into account a five-hour stop due to fog and the proximity of icebergs. The ship briefly managed to exceed 25 knots. Also, her coal consumption was significantly lower than that of &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;. Many passengers enjoyed the voyage. On the return trip, the success was renewed; she carried a total of 2,649 passengers, which was a record for a British liner leaving New York.
Upon arrival at her home port, she underwent minor modifications, which took into account observations made during the two first crossings (this was typical for a liner after its first round trip). Two more round trips took place in the second half of June and the whole of July of that year. Her architect Leonard Peskett was on board during those trips to note any defect and room for improvement. In total, 11,208 passengers travelled on the ship during her first six crossings. Her career was abruptly interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, which removed her from passenger service for six years.

In June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the world was soon plunged into World War I. &quot;Aquitania&quot; was converted into an armed merchant cruiser on 5 August 1914, for which provision had been made in her design. On 8 August, having been rid of decorative elements and armed with guns, she was sent on patrol. On 22 August, she collided with a liner named &quot;Canadian&quot;. Shortly after, the Admiralty found that large liners were too expensive to operate as cruisers. On 30 September, she was repaired, disarmed, and returned to Cunard Line.
After being idle for a time, in the spring of 1915 she was recalled by the Admiralty and converted into a troopship, and made voyages to the Dardanelles, sometimes running alongside &quot;Britannic&quot; or &quot;Mauretania&quot;. Around 30,000 men were transported on the ship to the battlefield between May and August of that year. &quot;Aquitania&quot; then was converted into a hospital ship, and acted in that role during the Dardanelles campaign. In 1916, the year that White Star&#x27;s flagship, and one of &quot;Aquitania&quot;″s main rivals, &quot;Britannic&quot;, was sunk, &quot;Aquitania&quot; was returned to the trooping front, and then in 1917 was laid up in the Solent. In 1918, now under the command of James Charles, the ship was back on the high seas in troopship service, conveying North American troops to Britain. Many of these departures were from the port of Halifax, Nova Scotia where the ship&#x27;s dazzle paint scheme was captured by artists and photographers, including Antonio Jacobsen. On one occasion &quot;Aquitania&quot; transported over 8,000 men. During her nine voyages, she transported approximately a total of 60,000 men. During this period, she collided with USS &quot;Shaw&quot; and tore apart its bow. The accident killed a dozen members of the American ship&#x27;s crew.

After the end of the war, in December 1918, &quot;Aquitania&quot; was dismissed from military service. She collided with the British cargo ship at New York in the United States on 28 February 1919. &quot;Lord Dufferin&quot; sank and &quot;Aquitania&quot; rescued her crew. &quot;Lord Dufferin&quot; was later refloated and beached.

==Interwar career==
In June 1919, &quot;Aquitania&quot; ran a Cunard &quot;austerity service&quot; between Southampton, Cherbourg, and New York. In December of that year &quot;Aquitania&quot; was docked at the Armstrong Whitworth yards in Newcastle to be refitted for post-war service. The ship was converted from coal burner to oil-fired, which greatly reduced the number of engine room crew required. The original fittings and art pieces, removed when refitted for military use, were brought out of storage and re-installed. At some point during this time, a new wheelhouse was constructed above the original one as the officers had complained about the visibility over the ship&#x27;s bow. The second wheelhouse can be seen in later pictures of the era and the original wheelhouse area below had the windows plated in.

===1920s===

&quot;Aquitania&quot; resumed her commercial service on 17 July 1920, leaving from Liverpool with 2,433 passengers on board. The crossing was a success; the ship maintained good speed while showing that now being oil-fueled was much cheaper than coal-fueled propulsion. The ship&#x27;s arrival in New York Harbor was filmed as part of the pioneering 1921 documentary &quot;Manhatta&quot;, in which she is seen being pushed to her destination by tugboats. The months that followed were just as promising, despite a stewards&#x27; strike in May 1921. At the beginning of the decade, &quot;Aquitania&quot; was the only large liner in the service of Cunard Line as the &quot;Mauretania&quot; was undergoing repair after a fire. The year 1921 was thus an exceptional year for her; she crossed the Atlantic 30 times (15 round trips) and broke a record by transporting a total of 60,587 passengers that year (including 26,331 in third class), averaging more than 2,000 passengers per crossing. In the following year, the &quot;Mauretania&quot; rejoined her in Cunard service. &quot;Aquitania&quot; operated in service with the &quot;Mauretania&quot; and (formerly the German liner &quot;Imperator&quot;) in a trio known as &quot;The Big Three.&quot;

In 1924, a new restriction on immigration was passed in the United States, causing the number of third-class passengers to decline significantly. From more than 26,000 third-class passengers transported by &quot;Aquitania&quot; in 1921, the figure fell to about 8,200 third-class passengers in 1925. The number of crew was thus reduced to around 850 people from the original 1,200. The third class was no longer the key to the profitability of the liner, and so the company had to adapt. The third-class gradually became a tourist class, which offered decent service at a low price. In 1926, the ship underwent a major overhaul, which reduced the passenger capacity from around 3,300 to around 2,200.

Still, the Cunard Line benefited from prohibition in the United States, which started in 1919. American liners were legally part of the territory of the United States, and thus alcoholic beverages could not be served on them. Passengers who wanted to drink therefore travelled on British liners in order to do so. &quot;Aquitania&quot; enjoyed great success, making much profit for her company. In 1929, she underwent a major refit. A bathroom was added to many first-class cabins, and the tourist class was renovated. While new competitors, such as the German liner SS &quot;Bremen&quot;, entered service, &quot;Aquitania&quot; remained particularly popular after fifteen years of service.

===Crisis of 1929 and its consequences===
Following the stock market crash of 1929, many ships were affected by the economic downturn and reduced traffic. &quot;Aquitania&quot; found herself in a tough position. Only a few could afford expensive passage on her now, so Cunard sent &quot;Aquitania&quot; on cheap cruises to the Mediterranean. These were successful, especially for Americans who went on &quot;booze cruises,&quot; tired of their country&#x27;s prohibition. Another problem also arose: the two liners of the Norddeutscher Lloyd, SS &quot;Bremen&quot; and SS &quot;Europa&quot;, successfully captured the Blue Riband and many customers. In 1934, the number of passengers &quot;Aquitania&quot; carried declined to around 13,000 from 30,000 in 1929. The ship, however, remained popular and she was the third busiest in the early 1930s behind those two German liners.
To keep the ship up to date, she underwent a refit, which added a cinema, between 1932 and 1933. At the same time, in order to modernise its fleet, the company ordered the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. The Great Depression, however, prevented the company from being able to fully finance the construction, and the company merged with its rival, the White Star Line, in 1934 in order to do so. The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; entered service in 1936. Author C. R. Bonsor writing in 1963 states, &quot;from 1936 on it became necessary to squeeze the maximum speed out of &quot;Aquitania&quot; in order to make her a suitable running mate for &quot;Queen Mary&quot; thus 24 knot passages became regular&quot;.

&quot;Aquitania&quot; ran aground in the Solent on 24 January 1934 but was refloated later the same day. The merger of the two companies into Cunard-White Star Line resulted in a large surplus of liners being owned by a single company. Thus, very old ships, such as the &quot;Mauretania&quot; and the &quot;Olympic&quot;, were removed from service immediately and sent to the scrapyard. However, the &quot;Aquitania&quot; was not, despite her age. On 10 April 1935, &quot;Aquitania&quot; went hard aground on Thorne Knoll in the Solent near Southampton, England, but with the aid of ten tugboats, on the next high tide the ship was freed. When the new liner RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was due to enter service in 1940, newspapers speculated that &quot;Aquitania&quot; would be scrapped that year, since the QE replaced her on the North Atlantic route. However, during that period, her performance continued to satisfy her company and the Second World War soon broke out as well, making the old ocean liner useful once again. The year 1939 saw an increase in the number of wealthy passengers on board. The ship was then already 26 years old.

==World War II service==
&quot;Aquitania&quot;, with a normal troop capacity of 7,400, was among the select group of large, fast former passenger ships capable of sailing independently without escort transporting large numbers of troops that were assigned worldwide as needed. These ships, often termed &quot;Monsters&quot; until London requested the term be dropped, were &quot;Aquitania&quot;, &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Mauretania&quot; (II), and with &quot;lesser monsters&quot; being other large ex-liners capable of independent sailing with large troop capacity that accounted for much of the troop capacity and deployment, particularly in the early days of the war.
Plans to replace &quot;Aquitania&quot; with the newer &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; in 1940 had been forestalled by outbreak of World War II in 1939. On 16 September 1939 &quot;Aquitania&quot;, awaiting initial refit as a troop ship, was at pier 90 in New York along with &quot;Queen Mary&quot; while nearby, at pier 88, were the French ships &quot;Île de France&quot; and . She returned to Southampton and was requisitioned on 18 November.

&quot;Aquitania&quot;″s initial troop transport operation was taking Canadian troops to Scotland, Convoy TC1 in company with &quot;Empress of Britain, Empress of Australia, , Monarch of Bermuda,&quot; HMS &quot;Hood&quot;, HMS &quot;Warspite&quot;, HMS &quot;Barham&quot;, HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;, HMS &quot;Furious&quot;, December 1939. Meanwhile, a massive transport of Australian and New Zealand troops to Suez and North Africa, with possible diversion to the United Kingdom if events required, was in planning with the numbered convoys to be designated as &quot;US&quot; with the large Atlantic liners assigned a role. The fast convoy designated as US.3 was composed of &quot;Aquitania&quot; and the liners &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Mauretania&quot;, , , and . &quot;Aquitania&quot;, &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; and &quot;Empress of Japan&quot;, after embarking New Zealand troops at Wellington in May, sailed escorted by , , and to join the Australian component off Sydney on 5 May 1940. Joined off Sydney by &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot; the convoy sailed the same day to be joined the next by &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; from Melbourne for a stop at Fremantle 10–12 May before the voyage intended to be for Colombo. About midway to Colombo, on 15 May, the convoy was rerouted due to the rapid German penetrations into France with the ultimate destination of Gourock, Scotland via Cape Town, South Africa and Freetown, Sierra Leone where the escort strengthened by various ships including the aircraft carriers and and the battlecruiser . The convoy arrived in the Clyde and anchored off Gourock on 16 June 1940.
Now repainted battleship grey, in November 1941 &quot;Aquitania&quot; was in the British colony of Singapore, from which she sailed to take part indirectly in the loss of the Australian cruiser . &quot;Sydney&quot; had engaged in battle with the German auxiliary cruiser . There has been much unsubstantiated speculation that &quot;Kormoran&quot; was expecting &quot;Aquitania&quot;, after spies in Singapore had notified &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s crew of the liner&#x27;s sailing and planned to ambush her in the Indian Ocean west of Perth but instead encountered &quot;Sydney&quot; on 19 November. Both ships were lost after a fierce battle. On the morning of 24 November &quot;Aquitania&quot; en route to Sydney from Singapore spotted and picked up twenty-six survivors of the German ship but maintained radio silence and did not pass word until in visual range of Wilson&#x27;s Promontory on 27 November. The captain had gone against orders not to stop for survivors of sinkings. There were no survivors from &quot;Sydney&quot;.

December saw the outbreak of war in the Pacific, then Japanese advances throughout Southeast Asia and toward Australia, necessitating the redeployment of defensive forces. On 28 December &quot;Aquitania&quot; and two smaller transports departed Sydney with 4,150 Australian troops and 10,000 tons of equipment for Port Moresby, New Guinea. (On the same date, and other U.S. ships evacuating from the north reached Darwin, with , and elements of her diverted Philippine convoy some ahead.) &quot;Aquitania&quot; was back in Sydney on 8 January 1942. The next effort was reinforcement of Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies with &quot;Aquitania&quot; transporting Australian troops (whose equipment was in Convoy MS.1) as the single ship MS.2 convoy, under escort of HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot;. The ship had been the only suitable transport for such a large movement. Originally, transport directly to Singapore was considered, but the danger from aircraft to such a valuable asset and so many troops caused a change of plans. Instead, &quot;Aquitania&quot; departed Sydney on 10 January, reaching Ratai Bay at the Sunda Strait on 20 January, where 3,456 personnel (including some Navy, Air Force and civilians) were transhipped under a covering naval force to seven smaller vessels (six of them Dutch KPM ships) that would continue to Singapore as convoy MS.2A. &quot;Aquitania&quot; was returned to Sydney on 31 January.
With the United States in the war, &quot;Aquitania&quot; (then with a troop capacity of 4,500) had been scheduled for transport duties from the United States to Australia in February, but necessary repairs delayed that. Because her deep draft was hazardous in Australian and intermediate ports in the Pacific Islands, she spent March and April 1942 transporting troops from the west coast of the U.S. to Hawaii. Then &quot;Aquitania&quot; was temporarily transferred from Pacific duties to support the movement of troops from the United States to Britain, sailing 30 April from New York in a large convoy that transported some 19,000 troops.
On 12 May 1942 &quot;Aquitania&quot; loaded troops at Gourock destined for the war in the Middle East, departing in convoy WS19P on 1 June with destroyers and heavy weather, she broke off independently on 7 June due to her greater speed with designation WS19Q. The first port of call was 48 hours at Freetown (West Africa) on 11 June, then 3 days at Simonstown, South Africa 20 June 48 hours at Diego Suarez, Madagascar from 30 June 24 hours at Steamer Point, Aden on 3 July, and then disembarkation at Port Tewfik, Egypt from 8 July 1942. The return journey was via Diego Suarez, Cape Town, Freetown and then to Boston. By September &quot;Aquitania&quot; was engaged in a triangular troop deployment of United States-United Kingdom-Indian Ocean voyages.

As part of the major redeployment of Australian troops from North Africa to the defence of Australia and start of offensive operations in the Southwest Pacific. &quot;Aquitania&quot;, &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Île de France&quot;, &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;, and the armed merchant cruiser HMS &quot;Queen of Bermuda&quot; transported the Australian 9th Division to Sydney in Operation Pamphlet during January and February 1943.

By the buildup for the invasion of Europe in 1944 troop deployments to Britain depended heavily on &quot;Aquitania&quot; and the other &quot;Monsters&quot; and no allowance could be made for interruption of their service for other transport requirements.

Wartime embarkation at New York is described in some detail in the description of the departure of the Special Navy Advance Group 56 (SNAG 56) that was to become Navy Base Hospital Number 12 at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley, England, to receive casualties from Normandy. The unit was sent by &quot;devious routes&quot; by train to Jersey City where under cover of darkness they boarded a ferry crossing to the covered pier 86 in New York where a band played and the Red Cross served their last coffee and doughnuts as they boarded &quot;N.Y. 40&quot;, the New York Port of Embarkation code designation for &quot;Aquitania&quot;, which got underway the morning of 29 January 1944 with some 1,000 Navy and 7,000 Army personnel for arrival at Gourock, Scotland 5 February.

In eight years of military work, &quot;Aquitania&quot; sailed more than 500,000 miles, and carried nearly 400,000 soldiers, to and from places as far afield as New Zealand, Australia, the South Pacific, Greece and the Indian Ocean. Cunard historian Michael Gallagher said: &quot;Wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill credited &quot;Aquitania&quot;, with &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, for shortening World War II in Europe by a year&quot;.

== Postwar service and retirement ==

After completing troopship service, the vessel was handed back to Cunard-White Star in 1948. She underwent a refit for passenger service. She was then used to transport war brides and their children to Canada under charter from the Canadian government. This final service created a special fondness for &quot;Aquitania&quot; in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the port of disembarkation for these immigration voyages.
&quot;Aquitania&quot; sailed on her last commercial voyage from Halifax to Southampton, from 24 November 1949 to 1 December 1949. After serving her purpose, the old &quot;Aquitania&quot; was taken out of service in December 1949, when the ship&#x27;s Board of Trade certificate was not renewed as the condition of the ship had deteriorated, and it would have been cost-prohibitive to be brought up to new safety standards, namely fire code regulations. The decks leaked in foul weather, the bulkheads and funnels were corroded to a point that one could stick their finger through them. A long-standing rumor was made that during a corporate luncheon held on the ship, a piano had fallen through the roof of one of the dining rooms from the deck above. This has been proven to be false.
After its last voyage in February 1950 from Southampton to Faslane, the vessel was sold to British Iron and Steel Corporation for scrap for £125,000 at Faslane in Scotland. Dismantling took more than a year and was finished in November 1951. This ended a career which included steaming 3 million miles over 450 round voyages. &quot;Aquitania&quot; carried 1.2 million passengers through an active sea career that spanned nearly 36 years, making her the longest-serving Express Liner of the 20th century. &quot;Aquitania&quot; was the only major liner and largest vessel to serve in and survive both World Wars. She was also the last four-funnelled passenger ship to be scrapped. The ship&#x27;s wheel and a detailed scale model of &quot;Aquitania&quot; may be seen in the Cunard exhibit at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax.

Maritime author N. R. P. Bonsor wrote of &quot;Aquitania&quot; in 1963: &quot;Cunard had recovered possession of their veteran in 1948 but she was not worth reconditioning. In 35 years of service &quot;Aquitania&quot; had sailed more than 3 million miles and apart from one or two early Allan Line steamers no other ship served for as long in a single ownership.&quot;

<text>The Glaciated Allegheny Plateau is that portion of the Allegheny Plateau that lies within the area covered by the last glaciation. As a result, this area of the Allegheny Plateau has lower relief and gentler slopes than the relatively rugged Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. In general, the glaciated lies to the north and west of the unglaciated, and forms an arc in northeastern to southeastern Ohio lying between the glacial till plains and the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. The Glaciated Allegheny Plateau extends into a belt of southern New York State and the central Susquehanna River basin.

A small area of the Allegheny Plateau was glaciated during the Wisconsin Stage, the late Illinoian Stage, and Pre-Illinoian B and G glaciations of the Pre-Illinoian Stage. This areaonly a few hundred square kilometers owing to the blockage the steep relief of the mountains provides at the edge of the ice sheetcontains only old drift now buried by long periods of soil development.

Major cities on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau are Akron and Youngstown.

<doc id="633666" wikidata="Q4705315" url="?curid=633666" title="Alabama School of Mathematics and Science">
<text>The Alabama School of Mathematics and Science (ASMS) is a public residential high school in the Midtown neighborhood of Mobile, Alabama. ASMS is a member of the National Consortium of Secondary STEM School (NCSSS). It graduated its first class in 1993.

The school was founded in 1989 as a unique public-private partnership. The Alabama School of Mathematics and Science is part of the state government, while the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science Foundation coordinates private support. It was modeled after the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts where students complete their final two or three years of high school focusing on advanced studies in mathematics and the sciences. Although a boarding school, it does not charge for tuition, books, room, or board. The only fees include an annual student activity fee, which covers class trips and other day-to-day activities, along with an enrollment fee (for new students only), a PSAT fee, and a graduation fee. The annual student activity fee is approximately $1,575. ASMS&#x27; focus is preparing its students for higher education, and residency is a requirement for all students.

ASMS&#x27;s mascot is a dragon.

==Academics==
All courses are taught at the Advanced Placement or Honors level. ASMS offers Advanced Placement courses in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science A, Environmental Science, Physics B, Physics C, Studio Art, English Literature and United States History. More than 40% of ASMS instructors hold terminal degrees, all have earned at least a master&#x27;s degree, and nearly 100% have taught at the college level. The academic program, which is comprehensive in the sciences as well as the humanities, is complemented by varsity and intramural sports, residential life activities, and college counseling.
ASMS is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is a member of the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools, or NCSSS.

Admission is open to all Alabama high school students via a process akin to college admissions. Initially, students could enter only as high school juniors, but since September 1998, the school has also allowed sophomores to apply. Students have been admitted as seniors in the past, but this is extremely rare.

The average composite ACT score for the class of 2024 was a 28.4 and 100% of the graduates matriculated at institutions of higher education

==Summer program==
ASMS also offers an academic summer camp for students entering the 7th through 9th grades. The Adventures In Math and Science summer program (AIMS) is typically held in June and enrolls roughly 1,000 students over the course of two weeks. Students from across Alabama can enroll in classes that are taught by ASMS instructors. The camp offers a residential program as well as a day-school program. Each AIMS student takes three courses of their choice per week each weekday with a weekend interim period at a local waterpark for students staying more than one week. Admissions to AIMS is highly competitive. More than 50 percent of incoming, full-time students have attended the AIMS summer program. AIMS is made possible by the ASMS Educational Association (ASMSEA). This association decides what camps to host, the costs, and many other details. It has around 15 board members, but anyone can vote for a new program. AIMS courses include: 3D Printing and Design; ACT Prep; All About Animals – Inside and Out; Apps for Smart Devices; Basic Geometry with Computers; CSI: Fun Forensics; Discovering the Alabama Outdoors; Drones and Race cars; Environmental Science; Estuaries: Where Rivers Meet the Sea; Exploring Inner Space; Game Design with Unity 3D; Geology of Minecraft; Invertebrate Zoology; Labs of Doom; Land, Sea, and Air: Basic Navigation, Buoyancy, and Energy of Propulsion; Learning Linux using the Raspberry Pi; Marine Biology; Meteorology; Phun Physics; Python Programming with Raspberry Pi; Robotics; Rocketry; and Studying Nature-Field Biology.

==Facilities==
ASMS was formerly the site of Mobile Dauphin Way Baptist Church. The church underwent extensive alterations to create classrooms, laboratories, and dormitories. In May 2006, the school commenced groundbreaking on the first new building since the building of the Boy&#x27;s Dorm. This construction demolished the old Student Activities Center (SAC), and was completed for by the start of the 2007/2008 academic year. The new building, called the Ann Smith Bedsole Building, was named after one of the main founders of the school, former State Senator Ann Bedsole. The Bedsole Building included a new library, reception area, several classrooms and offices, a coffee room, TV/lounge room, and games room.

ASMS is home to four residence halls: Newton, Einstein, Da Vinci, and Curie. Respectively named after Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, and Marie Curie. Boys and girls are evenly divided between the halls. Over the school year, these halls compete with each other in various events to earn hall points. At the end of the year, the hall with the most points is announced as the winning hall and is awarded bragging rights until the next hall is crowned.

In previous years, the girls&#x27; dormitory has been spread out over two buildings. Halls one through four are in the girls&#x27; dorm building, while humanities, the &quot;fifth hall&quot; is on the fourth floor of the student center (previously the humanities building). Humanities is ASMS&#x27; honor hall, which only houses second-year students who have to apply to live there. Girls on the humanities hall partake in competitions alongside Newton.

The boys&#x27; dormitory is in a separate two-story building, with Einstein and Da Vinci sharing the first floor, while Newton and Curie share the second.

Over the summer of 2024, ASMS has built a whole new building, the E. O. Wilson Science Research Center (WSRC). This facility is designed to support STEM learning as well as the ASMS Research Fellows Program. The building was named after Dr. Edward O. Wilson. 

Building the WSRC has allowed the former humanities building, the Ben May building, to be renovated into a student center, the Ben May Student Center, named after Ben E. May. The first floor includes a student kitchen, a movie room, a game room, and a lounge area. The second and third floors both have various study/meeting rooms and lounge areas. 

== Research Fellows ==
Research Fellows is an innovative educational program where ASMS students are paired with a faculty mentor to work on a college-level research project throughout the school year. The program participants submit their work for competition at regional and state science fairs, regularly taking home top awards. All participants present at the school&#x27;s Spring Research Forum, where alumni evaluators provide feedback, and some students go on to deliver presentations at national conferences.

==School traditions==
Events are held by the Student Engagement Team for the entertainment, enrichment, and teambuilding of students. All traditions are beloved by students and have been part of the culture for years or decades. Though some traditions come and go, there are always rituals that permeate the student body and fill the campus with life.

===Goofy Olympics===
Goofy Olympics is held in the fall, when a typical high school might hold a homecoming football game. On Spirit Day, classes end earlier in the afternoon. Students dress up in their hall colors and meet up at West Campus to partake in a series of competitions between the residence halls. The selection of competitions changes each year, but always includes a race through an inflatable obstacle course. 

===Geekfest===
In fall of 2004, Mike Zambrano (President of high fantasy club), Matt McCawley (President of DDR club), and Licki Kallenberg, Anindo Sarker (Anime club) organized a large, entertainment-oriented event that involved the whole student body. Due to its popularity, the event became a school tradition, generally held twice a year. The principal organizers for 2005/2006 were Jonathan Kush and Jean-Jacques DeLisle (presidents of the anime and RPG clubs respectively). The current organization of geekfest is not handled by these clubs but instead operates as an independent organization.

This event includes activities that are predominantly associated with &quot;Geek&quot; culture, such as anime and/or film showings, a LAN party for PCs, independent console games, board games, card games, DDR, Guitar Hero, as well as other events. 

===Mega Musical Chairs===
This event (usually a fundraiser) is as the name suggests; It is a large game of musical chairs. Students usually compete for prizes and have faculty, staff, and student volunteers (usually members of the SGA) distracting them with water guns and water balloons. The SGA works to secure sponsorships, and the winner of the game gets to choose the charity where the money will be donated.

During the event, faculty members (recently, Derek Barry, history professor) act as referees for the event.

===Stress Fest===
Over the weekend before the final exam week of the Spring term, the school hosts Stress Fest, designed to alleviate students&#x27; stress and give them time to enjoy themselves before final exams. The event mainly consists of field games, tournaments, a rock wall, an ice cream truck, tie-dye T-shirts, barbecue cookouts, and live band performances. During stress fest the first karaoke nights were created and later popularized by student groups such as &quot;Ben Le and The Band&quot;.

Stress Fest was a part of Student Life through the 2000s and into the late 2010s but was discontinued due to budget cuts and an increasing lack of interest. The event was brought back for the 2023/2024 school year and is expected to continue to be a tradition.

<doc id="633679" wikidata="Q918865" url="?curid=633679" title="British Columbia Highway 1">
<text>Highway 1 is a provincial highway in British Columbia, Canada, that carries the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH). The highway is long and connects Vancouver Island, the Greater Vancouver region in the Lower Mainland, and the Interior. It is the westernmost portion of the main TCH to be numbered &quot;Highway 1&quot;, which continues through Western Canada and extends to the Manitoba–Ontario boundary. The section of Highway 1 in the Lower Mainland is the second-busiest freeway in Canada, after Ontario Highway 401 in Toronto.

The highway&#x27;s western terminus is in the provincial capital of Victoria, where it serves as a city street and freeway in the suburbs. Highway 1 travels north to Nanaimo and reaches the Lower Mainland at Horseshoe Bay via a BC Ferries route across the Strait of Georgia. The highway bypasses Vancouver on a freeway that travels through Burnaby, northern Surrey, and Abbotsford while following the Fraser River inland. The freeway ends in Hope, where Highway 1 turns north and later east to follow the Fraser and Thompson rivers into the Interior and through Kamloops. The highway continues east across the Columbia Mountains, serving three national parks: Mount Revelstoke, Glacier, and Yoho. Highway 1 enters Alberta at Kicking Horse Pass near Banff National Park.

Highway 1 was preceded by several overland trails and wagon roads established in the mid-to-late 19th century, including the Old Yale Road in the Fraser Valley, the Cariboo Road, and the Big Bend Highway. The provincial government designated Highway 1 in 1941 on a portion of the Island Highway between Victoria and Kelsey Bay as well as the Vancouver–Banff highway. It was incorporated into the national Trans-Canada Highway program, which was established in 1949 and completed in 1962. Other sections of the highway were realigned in later years, including a new freeway in the Lower Mainland that opened in the 1960s and 1970s and was numbered Highway 401.

==Vancouver Island section==
The western terminus of Highway 1 and the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway is at Dallas Road on the southern coast of Victoria, which faces the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The terminus is marked by the Mile Zero Monument, a wooden sign at the foot of Beacon Hill Park, with a nearby statue of runner Terry Fox to commemorate his cross-country marathon that was planned to end at the monument. The highway travels north on Douglas Street and forms the boundary between the residential James Bay neighbourhood to the west and Beacon Hill Park to the east. At the northwest edge of the park, Blanshard Street, which later carries Highway 17, splits off from the highway to run a block east, staying parallel to Douglas Street. Highway 1 passes the Royal BC Museum and intersects Belleville Street, a short connector that carries a section of Highway 17 from the Black Ball Ferries terminal (which is used by the to Port Angeles, Washington) and passes the British Columbia Parliament Buildings.

The highway travels through Downtown Victoria and passes several city landmarks, including the Fairmont Empress Hotel, the Bay Centre, Chinatown, and Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre. It follows Douglas Street, a six-lane urban thoroughfare with bus lanes during peak periods, and continues north into the suburban municipality of Saanich. Near the Uptown shopping centre, Highway 1 turns west and becomes a limited-access road that travels alongside the Galloping Goose Regional Trail through residential areas and along the north side of Portage Inlet. The highway becomes a full freeway with four-to-six lanes as it enters the town of View Royal and travels around the north side of Mill Hill Regional Park. It then intersects Highway 14 in Langford and reverts to a limited-access road with a median divider. Highway 1 (part of the Island Highway) then travels around Bear Mountain and turns north to follow the Goldstream River into Goldstream Provincial Park, where it meets several trailheads.

The Island Highway continues along the west side of the Saanich Inlet and enters the Cowichan Valley Regional District near Malahat. It descends from Malahat Summit, at above sea level, on a highway with passing lanes and a median barrier added in the late 2010s in response to a high rate of collisions. The section also has occasional closures, relying on the limited-capacity Mill Bay Ferry or the longer Pacific Marine Circle Route as alternate connections between Greater Victoria and other Vancouver Island communities. Highway 1 passes the Malahat SkyWalk, an observation built by the Malahat First Nation, and through farmland surrounding Mill Bay. The highway travels around central Duncan and through North Cowichan and Ladysmith as it continues north as a divided highway with limited access at signalized intersections. In southern Nanaimo, it has a short concurrency with Highway 19, which continues east to the Duke Point ferry terminal and northwest along the Strait of Georgia. Highway 1 travels through central Nanaimo on Nicol Street and Stewart Avenue to the Departure Bay ferry terminal, where the Vancouver Island section ends. BC Ferries operates an automobile ferry service from Departure Bay to Horseshoe Bay that carries Highway 1 to the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. A typical vessel assigned to the route can carry 1,460 to 1,571 passengers and 310 to 322 vehicles.

===History===

The Vancouver Island section of Highway 1 was designated in the initial numbering scheme announced by the provincial government in March 1940, along with Highway 1A. It originally connected Victoria to Kelsey Bay, a small coastal community north of Campbell River. The Vancouver Island section was truncated to downtown Nanaimo in 1953, with the section north of Nanaimo being re-numbered to Highway 19. When BC Ferries took over the ferry route between Departure Bay in Nanaimo and Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver in 1961, Highway 1 was extended to the Departure Bay ferry dock.

The Malahat Highway was completed in 1911 as a gravel road with a single lane and was later upgraded to two paved lanes. A bridge across the Finlayson Arm to bypass the section was among 19 options studied in 2007, but were discarded in favor of other solutions that would cost less. In 2019, the provincial government studied the construction of a permanent detour for the Goldstream–Malahat section of Highway 1 and identified several potential routes, but instead decided to move forward with safety improvements to the existing highway. The section was severely damaged by several floods in November 2021, which closed the road for several days and required $15 million in repairs the following year.

==Lower Mainland section==

===Route details===
Sections of Highway 1 from Grandview Highway in Vancouver to 216 Street in Langley vary from being 3 to 4 lanes in each direction, with one of these lanes being a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane. These HOV lanes were constructed in 1998 as part of the BC MOT&#x27;s &quot;Go Green&quot; project to promote the use of HOV vehicles, and cost $62 million. The highway shortens to two lanes per direction after leaving Langley (Metro Vancouver), and enters Abbotsford (Fraser Valley).

=== History ===
====North Shore====
The Upper Levels Highway opened between Horseshoe Bay and Taylor Way in West Vancouver on September 14, 1957, replacing a section of Marine Drive that had carried Highway 1. Construction on a new, high-level Second Narrows Bridge began two months later and was planned to be incorporated into the Trans-Canada Highway upon completion. On June 17, 1958, several spans of the unfinished bridge collapsed during work on the main arch; 18 workers died and one diver also died during a later search at the site. The Second Narrows Bridge was dedicated to the accident&#x27;s victims and opened to traffic on August 25, 1960; it cost $23 million to construct and was the second-longest bridge in Canada at the time of its completion. The Upper Levels Highway was extended east to the Second Narrows Bridge on March 4, 1961; the limited-access highway across North Vancouver cost $50 million to construct.

====Vancouver to Chilliwack====
Prior to the opening of the freeway (and prior to the 1980s and 1990s, expressway) segments of the present Trans-Canada, traffic used the Pattullo Bridge, Kingsway, and Fraser Highway as the Trans-Canada Highway. These roads were a part of the Highway 1 from its designation in 1940 until the redesignation of the B.C.&#x27;s 400 series highways in 1972/73.&lt;ref name=&quot;G22/72&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1932 a new cutoff across northern parts of the drained Sumas Lake was mostly built. The cutoff bypassed the Yale Road which avoided the historical lake by running on its southern flank and along the base of Vedder Mountain. The highway was initially partly gravel, but it was fully paved within a few years of its opening.

From 1960 to 1964, the province opened several expressway and freeway segments as a part of a continuous express route between Bridal Falls and Taylor Way in West Vancouver.

On August 1, 1960, the Chilliwack Bypass was officially opened by Highways Minister Phil Gaglardi, MLA for Chillwack William Kenneth Kiernan and a six-year-old girl who cut the blue ribbon. About of the road had been opened before Gaglardi officially opened the bypass. Work on the bypass started on December 12, 1956, with two men clearing bushes.

Around the time of opening of the Chilliwack Bypass, a bypass of Abbotsford was also being constructed. That section of freeway was officially opened by Phil Gaglardi on April 19, 1962.

On May 1, 1964, the section of Freeway between what is now north of the 1st Avenue interchange to the Cape Horn Interchange opened. This was followed on June 12 by the opening of the Port Mann bridge, and the official opening of the freeway-expressway system from Bridal Falls to Taylor Way. A 90-year-old man and 11-year-old girl assisted Premier W.A.C. Bennett and Phil Gaglardi in opening the bridge. At the time of the bridge&#x27;s opening, various speed limits were in effect. The section from Bridal Falls to the Port Mann Bridge had a limit. Through Burnaby, was the limit. Speeds dropped on approach to Cassiar Street with a limit west of Boundary Road, with a drop to for Cassiar Street.

=====New interchanges and upgrades=====
Over the years, various interchanges have been built and rebuilt.

On July 31, 1969, the interchange with Lickman Road in Chilliwack opened. The Prest Road overpass followed in the early 1970s.

In January 1992 the Cassiar Tunnel opened. The project replaced a surface street section of Cassiar Street which was used by traffic to get from the Burnaby Freeway to the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge.

Through the 2000s and 2010s multiple interchanges were upgraded and rebuilt along the highway. The Gateway program saw the rebuilding of several interchanges from Willingdon Avenue to 176 Street. Through Abbotsford the Mount Lehman/Fraser Highway, Clearbrook Road, and McCallum Road interchanges were rebuilt.

On June 9, 2011, Highway 1 between 152 Street in Surrey and Highway 11 in Abbotsford was designated as the &quot;Highway of Heroes&quot;.

On September 4, 2020, a new interchange with 216 Street was opened.

On November 10, 2022, it was announced that major construction of a new overpass at Glover Road (which will be built first), a revised interchange with Highway 10/232 St. and widening to three lanes between 216 Street and Highway 13/264 St. had started. This work is part of a plan to eventually widen the highway to Whatcom Road in Abbotsford.

==Interior section==
Several sections of Highway 1 between Revelstoke and the Alberta border are under the jurisdiction of Parks Canada.

=== History ===
The first section of the highway to be twinned was the 12-kilometre stretch in 1984–1985 through Malakwa starting 8 kilometres east of Sicamous until Oxbow Road. This remained the only four-lane stretch east of Kamloops until the 2000s.

Since the 2000s, 25 kilometres of road in the Kicking Horse Pass near Golden have been rebuilt in phases to modern standards, with four lanes and the removal of sharp corners. The final phase is due for completion in 2024.

During major floods in November 2021, sections of Highway 1 between Hope and Spences Bridge were washed away into the Thompson River. Other sections of the highway on Vancouver Island and a railroad underpass near Lytton were also damaged in the same event. As a result of the floods, which also damaged other highways in the Fraser Valley, road connections from Metro Vancouver to the rest of Canada were cut off.

===Future===

The Interior section of Highway 1 is considered sub-standard when compared to other highways with similar traffic volume in the U.S. or other parts of Canada. The majority of the route is a dangerous, undivided two-lane highway with sharp corners, prone to frequent closures and accidents. To address this, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has undertaken an effort to twin the highway to four-lane 100 km/h standards between Kamloops and Alberta, with a targeted completion date of 2050. Several stretches of four-lane divided highway, including the Monte Creek to Pritchard section; the four-lane portions of the Kicking Horse Canyon, the 13 km-long passing lanes near Blind Bay, and many smaller four-lane divided fragments typically 2–4 km in length, are the results of this effort. As of 2020, about 25 percent of the highway between Alberta and Kamloops has been upgraded to a divided four-lane cross-section. Several new projects have been funded and are expected to the constructed by 2023, including:

*A new 4.9 km-long four-lane divided section around Chase, involving the construction of an interchange at the town;
*A new interchange and twinned highway at the West entrance of Salmon Arm;
*A new four-lane bridge across the Shuswap River in Sicamous;
*A new rest area and a 2 km-long four-lane section in the Illecillewaet Valley;
*A 4.4 km-long twinning near Quartz Creek east of Golden;
*And upgrading the remaining 4 km-long stretch of two-lane highway in the Kicking Horse Canyon.

<doc id="633682" wikidata="Q113951" url="?curid=633682" title="Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn">
<text>Erik Maria [[Ritter]] von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (31 July 1909 – 26 May 1999) was an Austrian-American nobleman and polymath, whose areas of interest included philosophy, history, political science, economics, linguistics, art and theology. He opposed the ideas of the French Revolution, as well as those of communism and Nazism. Describing himself as a &quot;conservative arch-liberal&quot; or &quot;extreme liberal&quot;, Kuehnelt-Leddihn often argued that majority rule in democracies is a threat to individual liberties. He declared himself a monarchist and an enemy of all forms of totalitarianism, although he also supported what he defined as &quot;non-democratic republics&quot;, such as Switzerland and the early United States. Kuehnelt-Leddihn cited the U.S. Founding Fathers, Tocqueville, Burckhardt, and Montalembert as the primary influences for his skepticism towards democracy.

Described as a &quot;Walking Book of Knowledge&quot; by William F. Buckley Jr., Kuehnelt-Leddihn had an encyclopedic knowledge of humanities and was a polyglot, being able to speak eight languages and read seventeen others. His early books &quot;The Menace of the Herd&quot; (1943) and &quot;Liberty or Equality&quot; (1952) were influential within the American conservative movement. An associate of Buckley Jr., his best-known writings appeared in &quot;National Review&quot;, where he was a columnist for 35 years.

==Early life and career==
Kuehnelt-Leddihn was born in Tobelbad, Styria, Austria-Hungary. At 16, he became the Vienna correspondent of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. From then on, he wrote for the rest of his life. He studied civil and canon law at the University of Vienna at 18. Then he went to the University of Budapest, from which he received an M.A. in economics, studying under Pál Teleki, and later his doctorate in political science. Moving back to Vienna, he took up studies in theology. In 1935, Kuehnelt-Leddihn traveled to England to become a schoolmaster at Beaumont College, a Jesuit public school. Subsequently, he moved to the United States, where he taught at Georgetown University (1937–1938), Saint Peter&#x27;s College, New Jersey (head of the History and Sociology Department, 1938–1943), Fordham University (Japanese, 1942–1943), and Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia (1943–1947).

In a 1939 letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kuehnelt-Leddihn critiqued the design of every American coin then in circulation except for the Washington quarter, which he allowed was &quot;so far the most satisfactory coin&quot; and judged the Mercury dime to be &quot;the most deplorable.&quot;

After publishing books like &quot;Jesuiten, Spießer und Bolschewiken&quot; in 1933 (published in German by Pustet, Salzburg) and &quot;The Menace of the Herd&quot; in 1943, in which he criticized the National Socialists as well as the Socialists, he remained in the United States, as he could not return to the Austria that had been incorporated into the Third Reich. Kuehnelt-Leddihn moved to Washington, D.C. in 1937, where he taught at Georgetown University. He also lectured at Fordham University, teaching a course in Japanese.

Following the Second World War, he resettled in Lans, where he lived until his death. He was an avid traveler: he had visited over seventy-five countries (including the Soviet Union in 1930–1931), as well as all fifty states in the United States and Puerto Rico. In October 1991, he appeared on an episode of &quot;Firing Line&quot;, where he debated monarchy with Michael Kinsley and William F. Buckley Jr.

Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote for a variety of publications, including &quot;Chronicles&quot;, &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Rothbard-Rockwell Report&quot;, &quot;Catholic World&quot;, and the Norwegian business magazine &quot;Farmand&quot;. He also worked with the Acton Institute, which declared him after his death &quot;a great friend and supporter.&quot; He was an adjunct scholar of the Ludwig von Mises Institute. For much of his life, Kuehnelt was also a painter; he illustrated some of his own books.

==Work==

His socio-political writings dealt with the origins and the philosophical and cultural currents that formed Nazism. He endeavored to explain the intricacies of monarchist concepts and the systems of Europe, cultural movements such as Hussitism and Protestantism, and what he saw as the disastrous effects of an American policy derived from antimonarchical feelings and ignorance of European culture and history.

Kuehnelt-Leddihn directed some of his most significant critiques towards Wilsonian foreign policy activism. Traces of Wilsonianism could be detected in the foreign policies of Franklin Roosevelt; specifically, the assumption that democracy is the ideal political system in any context. Kuehnelt-Leddihn believed that Americans misunderstood much of Central European culture such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which Kuehnelt-Leddihn claimed as one of the contributing factors to the rise of Nazism. He also highlighted characteristics of the German society and culture (especially the influences of both Protestant and Catholic mentalities) and attempted to explain the sociological undercurrents of Nazism. Thus, he concludes that sound Catholicism, sound Protestantism, or even, probably, sound popular sovereignty (German-Austrian unification in 1919) would have prevented National Socialism although Kuehnelt-Leddihn rather dislikes the latter two.

Contrary to the prevailing view that the Nazi Party was a radical right-wing movement with only superficial and minimal leftist elements, Kuehnelt-Leddihn asserted that Nazism (National Socialism) was a strongly leftist, democratic movement ultimately rooted in the French Revolution that unleashed forces of egalitarianism, conformity, materialism and centralization. He argued that Nazism, fascism, radical-liberalism, anarchism, communism and socialism were essentially democratic movements, based upon inciting the masses to revolution and intent upon destroying the old forms of society. Furthermore, Kuehnelt-Leddihn claimed that all democracy is basically totalitarian and that all democracies eventually degenerate into dictatorships. He said that it was not the case for &quot;republics&quot; (the word, for Kuehnelt-Leddihn, has the meaning of what Aristotle calls πολιτεία), such as Switzerland, or the United States, as it was originally intended in its constitution. However, he considered the United States to have been to a certain extent subject to a silent democratic revolution in the late 1820s.

In &quot;Liberty or Equality&quot;, his masterpiece, Kuehnelt-Leddihn contrasted monarchy with democracy and presented his arguments for the superiority of monarchy: diversity is upheld better in monarchical countries than in democracies. Monarchism is not based on party rule and &quot;fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of Christian society.&quot; After insisting that the demand for liberty is about &quot;how&quot; to govern and by no means &quot;by whom&quot; to govern a given country, he draws arguments for his view that monarchical government is genuinely more liberal in this sense, but democracy naturally advocates for equality, even by enforcement, and thus becomes anti-liberal. As modern life becomes increasingly complicated across many different sociopolitical levels, Kuehnelt-Leddihn submits that the &quot;Scita&quot; (the political, economic, technological, scientific, military, geographical, psychological knowledge of the masses and of their representatives) and the &quot;Scienda&quot; (the knowledge in these matters that is necessary to reach logical-rational-moral conclusions) are separated by an incessantly and cruelly widening gap and that democratic governments are totally inadequate for such undertakings.

In February 1969, Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote an article arguing against seeking a peace deal to end the Vietnam War. Instead, he argued that the two options proposed, a reunification scheme and
the creation of a coalition Vietnamese government, were unacceptable concessions to the Marxist North Vietnam. Kuehnelt-Leddihn urged the US to continue the war until the Marxists were defeated.

Kuehnelt-Leddihn also denounced the US Bishops&#x27; 1983 pastoral &quot;The Challenge of Peace&quot;. He wrote that &quot;The Bishops&#x27; letter breathes idealism... moral imperialism, the attempt to inject theology into politics, ought to be avoided except in extreme cases, of which abolition and slavery are examples.&quot;

The complete work and correspondence of Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn is available at the Brenner Archive, University of Innsbruck https://www.uibk.ac.at/de/brenner-archiv/bestaende/kuehnelt/#werke

==Personal life==
Kuehnelt-Leddihn was married to Countess Christiane Gräfin von Goess, with whom he had three children. At the time of his death in 1999, he was survived by all four of them, as well as seven grandchildren. He and his wife were buried at their village church in Lans.

Kuehnelt held friendships with many of the major conservative intellectuals and figures of the 20th century, including William F. Buckley Jr., Russell Kirk, Crown Prince Otto von Habsburg, Friedrich A. Hayek, Mel Bradford, Ludwig von Mises, Wilhelm Röpke, Ernst Jünger, and Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). According to Buckley, Kuehnelt-Leddihn was &quot;the world&#x27;s most fascinating man.&quot; Catholic apologist Karl Keating stated that Kuehnelt-Leddihn was the most intelligent man he ever met.

In 1931, while in Hungary, Kuehnelt-Leddihn stated that he had a supernatural experience. While conversing with a friend, the two men saw Satan appear before them. Kuehnelt-Leddihn recounts this experience as so:

&quot;Slowly, in that moment, to both of us, Satan appeared as Satan appears in primitive books. Naked, reddish, horns, long tongue, trident, and we both exploded laughing. In other words, laughing hysterically. As I later found out, in apparitions of the Devil, this is a natural reaction, that you laugh hysterically.&quot;

==Sayings==
* &quot;&#x27;Welfare State&#x27; is a misnomer, for &quot;every&quot; state must care for the common good.&quot;
* &quot;For the average person, all problems date to World War II; for the more informed, to World War I; for the genuine historian, to the French Revolution.&quot;
* &quot;Liberty and equality are in essence contradictory.&quot;
* &quot;There is little doubt that the American Congress or the French Chambers have a power over their nations which would rouse the envy of a Louis XIV or a George III, were they alive today. Not only prohibition, but also the income tax declaration, selective service, obligatory schooling, the fingerprinting of blameless citizens, premarital blood tests—none of these totalitarian measures would even the royal absolutism of the seventeenth century have dared to introduce.&quot;
* &quot;I am for the word &quot;Rightist&quot;. Right is right and left is wrong, you see, and in all languages &#x27;right&#x27; has a positive meaning and &#x27;left&#x27; a negative one. In Italian, typically, &quot;la sinistra&quot; is &#x27;the left&#x27; and &quot;il sinistro&quot; is &#x27;the mishap&#x27; or &#x27;the calamity.&#x27; Japanese describes evil as &quot;hidar-imae&quot;, &#x27;the thing in front of the left.&#x27; And in the Bible, it says in Ecclesiastes, which the Hebrews call &quot;Koheleth&quot;, that “the heart of the wise man beats on his right side and the heart of the fool on his left.&#x27;

<doc id="633690" wikidata="Q836747" url="?curid=633690" title="Washington State Route 522">
<text>State Route 522 (SR 522) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington that serves the Seattle metropolitan area. Approximately long, it connects the city of Seattle to the northeastern suburbs of Kenmore, Bothell, Woodinville, and Monroe. Its western half is primarily an arterial street, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of Lake Washington; the eastern half is a grade-separated freeway that runs between Woodinville and Monroe. SR 522 connects several of the metropolitan area&#x27;s major highways, including Interstate 5 (I-5), I-405, SR 9, and U.S. Route 2 (US 2).

The present-day route of SR 522 was built in stages between 1907 and 1965, beginning with the Red Brick Road from Seattle to Bothell, then part of the Pacific Highway and later US 99. The road later became a branch of Primary State Highway 2 (PSH 2) in 1937, and was extended east to Redmond and North Bend. A branch of the Stevens Pass Highway was built to connect PSH 2 in Bothell and Monroe in 1965, and was incorporated into SR 202 after it was designated in 1964. The Bothell–Monroe highway was re-designated as part of SR 522 in 1970, leaving SR 202 on the Bothell–North Bend highway.

Since the late 1990s, the SR 522 corridor between Woodinville and Monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population. Portions of the highway near Woodinville and Monroe were widened between 2001 and 2014, while other sections near Maltby remain two lanes wide and undivided, with improvement projects left unfunded.

==Route description==
SR 522, named Lake City Way within Seattle city limits, begins at an interchange with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, and includes a connection to the freeway&#x27;s reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR 522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR 522 intersects SR 523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.

Beyond Seattle, the highway is named Bothell Way and follows the northern shore of Lake Washington. SR 522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR 104) at the central shopping center in Lake Forest Park, and is joined by the Burke-Gilman Trail, a multi-use trail running along the lakefront on a former railroad grade. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, located on the mouth of the Sammamish River and home to the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base. SR 522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards Bothell. The highway turns east and continues downhill of the city&#x27;s downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR 527). Leaving Bothell, SR 522 then travels around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell and Cascadia College campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.

East of I-405, SR 522 enters Woodinville and follows Little Bear Creek as it turns north away from the city&#x27;s downtown, intersecting SR 202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR 9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues through several sharp turns that follow the Eastside Rail Corridor, a former railroad grade that runs northeasterly through the predominantly rural area near Grace. In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR 522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR 522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US 2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US 2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR 522 to eastbound US 2.

The entire route of SR 522 is designated as part of the National Highway System, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The State of Washington also designates the SR 522 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state. The highway is the primary route for Seattle-area residents to access Stevens Pass and other parts of the Cascade Mountains. SR 522 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state&#x27;s highways to measure traffic volume in terms of annual average daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 96,000 vehicles used SR 522 at its interchange with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in Monroe, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.

==History==
===Red Brick Road===
Logging settlements were established on the northern shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.

Bothell businessman and good roads advocate Gerhard Ericksen successfully lobbied the Washington State Legislature to fund the construction of a road from Seattle to Bothell as a State Aid Road and Permanent Highway in 1903. The first section of the highway, traveling from Ravenna Park in Seattle to Lake Forest Park, was completed in 1907 and was pronounced by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; as one of the &quot;finest pieces of road to be found anywhere in the United States&quot;. From 1911 to 1913, the state and county government paved of the highway between Lake Forest Park and Bothell with bricks. The highway, named the Ericksen Road after its promoter and Bothell Road after the city of Bothell, was opened on January 10, 1914, in an event named the &quot;Boulevard Blowout&quot; that featured 50 automobiles traversing the entire route between Seattle and Bothell. Most of the brick road was replaced in 1934, but a section south of downtown Bothell was preserved and remains known as Red Brick Road Park.

===Federal and state highways===
The Bothell Road became part of the Pacific Highway in 1915, forming part of the highway that would continue north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day Lake City was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated in the memory of World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as US 99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US 99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, after lobbying from Lake City businessmen.

An unpaved extension of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was designated as a branch of the Sunset Highway (State Road 2) in 1925. The highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the Sunset Highway (re-designated as Primary State Highway 2) in 1937, running from Downtown Seattle to Fall City. The branch highway was extended to North Bend after the opening of a Sunset Highway bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.

Another branch of the Bothell Road, from Bothell to the Stevens Pass Highway (Primary State Highway 15) in Monroe, was proposed by the state good roads association in the late 1930s. In 1941, funding for this segment was rejected by the state senate, in favor of completing the highway between Everett and Monroe first. The Bothell–Monroe Cutoff was designated as a branch of Primary State Highway 15 in 1943, with a provision that the highway would be constructed after the completion of the Everett–Monroe route. The King County government also unsuccessfully lobbied in the early 1950s for a highway connecting Duvall to Skykomish along the Tolt River as an alternative to the Monroe cutoff. Construction of the highway was pushed back to 1961, and it was further delayed by rainy weather. The Bothell–Monroe Cutoff opened on February 10, 1965, costing $5.3 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) and cutting 20 minutes in travel time between Seattle and the Stevens Pass ski area.

In 1963, the state legislature commissioned a new state highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, initially with State Route 522 (SR 522) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State Route 202 (SR 202) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SR 522 had been moved to the Bothell–Monroe Cutoff, while SR 202 was moved to the Woodinville–North Bend highway.

===Freeway expansion and safety improvements===
The North Seattle section of the Everett–Seattle Freeway (now I-5) opened on August 28, 1963, including access to Bothell Way in the Roosevelt neighborhood. SR 522 was truncated to I-5, removing Roosevelt Way and Eastlake Avenue from the state highway system. A four-level freeway interchange with I-405 east of Bothell was completed in 1969, creating a connection between SR 522 and SR 202.

In 1968, the state highway department proposed the conversion of SR 522 into a freeway bypassing Lake City Way and Bothell Way. The plan drew heavy opposition from local residents, who feared bottlenecks and a reduction in quality of life, and was abandoned by the Washington State Highway Commission in 1970 before being dropped from regional plans in 1973. A shorter bypass of Lake City was proposed in 1975 but drew criticism at public hearings and was dropped. Freeway plans in Monroe moved forward instead, with the completion of a bypass to the west of downtown in 1972. SR 522 was moved from its routing on Main Street to the new freeway, which terminated at US 2 and removed a railroad grade crossing from the route.

Since the 1980s, population growth in Monroe and around the SR 522 has resulted in increased traffic congestion and safety issues, including a rise in accidents and crashes. The highway was originally designed for eventual conversion into a four-lane freeway, with leftover right-of-way and bridge approaches built in 1965. Between 1980 and 1995, the stretch of SR 522 between Woodinville and Monroe was the site of over 1,100 accidents and 40 deaths. SR 522 has been named as one of the most dangerous highways in the United States by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2007, among other lists. The rock band &quot;State Route 522&quot; formed in 1995 by local indie rock musician Jake Snider was named for the highway.

In response to the crashes on SR 522, local residents organized a grassroots campaign (named &quot;Citizens Rallying for a Safer Highway&quot;) to petition the state for safety improvements and a highway widening. In 1993, the state legislature allocated $180 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) in funding towards a five-stage widening project, but the funds were transferred to the general fund at the behest of Governor Mike Lowry. The 1994 supplemental transportation budget included $2 million for engineering studies on SR 522, with construction of a four-lane freeway funded through other means. State lawmakers recommended tolling SR 522 to pay off construction bonds, but the plan was shelved after opposition from local residents.

Existing state funds were used for the first stages of the SR 522 corridor project, including the addition of median rumble strips and improved pavement markers in 1995, which helped reduce head-on collisions. The city of Monroe replaced the eastern half of SR 522&#x27;s interchange with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with a roundabout, the first to be built in Snohomish County, in 2001. The first stage of the corridor project, completed in 2001, widened a section between SR 9 and Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) in Maltby at a cost of $22 million. At the time, the state government estimated that it would cost $82 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) to widen the remaining sections of SR 522; the projects had been prioritized under a 1998 ballot initiative, but funding was cut by Washington Initiative 695.

The second stage, a new single-point urban interchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was completed in 2006 at a cost of $37 million. The third stage of the SR 522 corridor project was completed in 2014, widening the highway to four lanes across the Snohomish River and through Monroe to US 2, where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in 2012. A new roundabout at the 164th Street Southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project, completing the dogbone interchange. A separate project to build a new intersection with flyover ramps at the south end of the University of Washington Bothell campus was completed in 2009 at a cost of $52.3 million. A section of SR 522 in Downtown Bothell was rebuilt in 2013 to improve safety and eliminate a hazardous intersection.

The remaining stages of the SR 522 corridor project between Maltby and the Snohomish River were planned to be funded by the Roads and Transit ballot measure in 2007, before it was rejected by local voters. The 2015 state transportation package included $10 million in design funding for an interchange at Paradise Lake Road in Maltby, to be made available in 2025, but construction of the interchange and widening of the remaining segment remains unfunded. The preliminary design options for the future diamond interchange would place the main ramps at either SR 524 or Paradise Lake Road. A coalition of politician and business leaders named &quot;Finish522&quot; was formed in 2018 to lobby the state government for barriers and complete grade separation in the wake of several fatal crashes in the mid-2010s. Long-term plans from WSDOT to address increasing traffic congestion in downtown Monroe include the construction of a highway bypass for US 2 to the north of the city. The project would include a northern extension of SR 522 to intersect the realigned US 2 near Kelsey Street and Chain Lake Road.

===Mass transit===
The western portion of SR 522, including Lake City Way and Bothell Way, is a major public transit corridor for the region and is served by Sound Transit Express and King County Metro bus routes. Bus lanes were added to sections of SR 522 in Seattle, Lake Forest Park, and Kenmore in the 1990s, and were expanded in the 2000s. In 2002, Sound Transit launched express Route 522, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Woodinville. The route was truncated to the Roosevelt light rail station when it opened in October 2021.

Sound Transit plans to run a Stride bus rapid transit line on SR 522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus as part of its Sound Transit 3 program, approved in 2016. The S3 Line is scheduled to begin service in 2028 and will terminate at the NE 148th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid-20th century, including the failed Forward Thrust ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-range plan.

<text>Silver Streak is a 1976 American thriller comedy film about a murder on a Los Angeles-to-Chicago train journey. It was directed by Arthur Hiller, written by Colin Higgins, and stars Gene Wilder, Jill Clayburgh, and Richard Pryor, with Patrick McGoohan, Ned Beatty, Clifton James, Ray Walston, Scatman Crothers, and Richard Kiel in supporting roles. The film score is by Henry Mancini. This film marked the first pairing of Wilder and Pryor, who were later paired in three other films.

The film is primarily set on a train called &quot;Silver Streak&quot;. A passenger accidentally finds out about the murder of an art historian and about efforts to discredit the victim&#x27;s book. A shady art dealer is profiting from forged works of Rembrandt and is willing to kill in order to maintain secrecy about his crimes.

The film was released on December 8, 1976 by 20th Century Fox, and it received positive reviews from critics as well as earning $51.1 million against a budget between $5.5 million and $6.5 million.

==Plot==
Aboard the &quot;Silver Streak&quot; train to Chicago for his sister&#x27;s wedding, book editor George Caldwell meets salesman Bob Sweet and Hilly Burns, the secretary to Rembrandt historian Professor Schreiner. George and Hilly share an instant attraction, and she invites him to her cabin. There, George witnesses Schreiner&#x27;s body falling from the train’s roof through her window. Although Hilly doubts what he saw, George investigates Schreiner&#x27;s compartment, where he encounters Whiney and Reace searching through Schreiner&#x27;s belongings. When Whiney hints that Hilly may be in danger, the burly Reace throws George off the train. Determined to help Hilly, George follows the tracks until he finds a farmer, who flies him ahead of the &quot;Silver Streak&quot; in her biplane so he can reboard.

Once back on the train, George sees Hilly with art dealer Roger Devereau and assumes they are romantically involved. Devereau claims that Whiney and Reace are his employees and their altercation was a misunderstanding. He also introduces George to a seemingly alive Schreiner—who is actually Devereau’s henchman, Johnson, in disguise. Convinced he was mistaken and upset by Hilly&#x27;s apparent relationship with Devereau, George gets drunk and confides in Sweet. Sweet reveals himself as FBI agent Stevens and explains that the FBI has been investigating Devereau, a criminal posing as an art appraiser. Stevens believes Devereau seeks Schreiner&#x27;s Rembrandt letters, which could expose him for authenticating forged Rembrandts. George then finds the letters hidden inside Schreiner&#x27;s book.

Reace attempts to assassinate George but kills Stevens instead. George escapes onto the train&#x27;s roof, where he kills Reace with a harpoon gun but is knocked off the train. On foot again, he encounters the local sheriff, who finds his story unbelievable and tries to arrest him as a suspect in Stevens&#x27;s murder. George escapes, steals a patrol car, and discovers arrested car thief Grover T. Muldoon in the back seat. Together, they race to catch the train at Kansas City to save Hilly. With police searching for George, Grover disguises him in blackface using shoe polish to help him reboard.

On the train, Devereau captures George and burns the Rembrandt letters. Posing as a steward, Grover rescues George and Hilly, but after a shootout with Devereau&#x27;s men, he and George are forced to jump from the train. They are quickly arrested and taken to FBI Chief Donaldson, who explains that George was publicly framed as guilty to lull Devereau into a false sense of security and ensure the police kept George safe.

George and Grover part on good terms before Donaldson halts the &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, evacuates the passengers, and surrounds it with police. A firefight ensues; Whiney is wounded, and George, aided by the returning Grover, reboards the train to kill Johnson and rescue Hilly. Devereau seizes the controls, sets the train to full speed, and throws Whiney off before George mortally wounds him. Devereau is then decapitated by an oncoming freight train.

With the &quot;Silver Streak&quot; out of control, George and a porter uncouple the passenger cars, activating their brakes, but the runaway engine crashes into Chicago&#x27;s central station, causing massive destruction. George, Hilly, and Grover observe the wreckage before Grover drives off in a stolen car. George and Hilly bid him farewell and walk away together, ready to start their new relationship.

==Production==

The film was based on an original screenplay by Colin Higgins, who at the time was best known for writing &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;. He wrote &quot;Silver Streak&quot; &quot;because I had always wanted to get on a train and meet some blonde. It never happened, so I wrote a script.&quot;

Higgins wrote &quot;Silver Streak&quot; for the producers of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a TV film he had written. Both they and Higgins wanted to get into television. The script was sent out to auction. It was set on an Amtrak train and Paramount was interested, but wanted Amtrak to give its approval. Alan Ladd Jr. and Frank Yablans at 20th Century Fox didn&#x27;t want to wait and bought the script for a then-record $400,000. Ladd said &quot;It was like the old Laurel and Hardy comedies. The hero is Laurel, he falls off the train, stumbles about, makes a fool of himself, but still gets the pretty girl. Audiences have identified with that since Buster Keaton.&quot;

Colin Higgins wanted George Segal for the hero – the character&#x27;s name is George – but Fox preferred Gene Wilder. Ladd reasoned that Wilder was &quot;younger, more identifiable for the younger audience. And he&#x27;s so average, so ordinary, and he gets caught up in all these crazy adventures.&quot; (Wilder was actually older than Segal.)

Colin Higgins claimed the producers did not want Richard Pryor cast because Pryor had recently walked off &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot;; he says the producer at one stage considered casting another black actor as a backup. However, Pryor was very professional during the shoot.

As Amtrak objected to some elements of the script, the movie was instead filmed on the Canadian Pacific Railway (known as CP Rail at the time), using CP passenger equipment from The Canadian disguised as the fictional railway AM Road&#x27;s &quot;Silver Streak&quot;. Most of the scenes were shot on the CP system in western Canada, and main station scenes filmed at and around Toronto Union Station with US location footage inserted at times. The railway yard shootout was filmed at CP&#x27;s Alyth Yard, and the final crash scene in Toronto Union Station was actually done at a studio lot.

==Release==
The film had over 400 previews around the United States starting November 28, 1976 in New York City. It had its premiere at Tower East Theater in New York on Tuesday, December 7, 1976 and opened in New York City the following day. It opened in Los Angeles on Friday, December 10 before opening nationwide in an additional 350 theaters on December 22.

== Reception ==
The film grossed over $51 million at the box office and was praised by critics, including Roger Ebert. It maintains a 76% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes from 25 reviews. Ruth Batchelor of the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; described it as a &quot;fabulous, funny, suspenseful, wonderful, marvelous, sexy, fantastic trip on a train, with the most lovable group of characters ever assembled.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, however, called the film &quot;a needlessly convoluted mystery yarn, which calls everyone&#x27;s identity into question except Wilder&#x27;s.&quot; Siskel, who gave the film just two stars, added that &quot;the story isn&#x27;t easy to follow&quot; and that &quot;I&#x27;m still not sure whether Clayburgh&#x27;s character, secretary to Devereaux, was in on the hustle from the beginning.&quot; (Hilly Burns was actually Professor Schreiner&#x27;s secretary, not Devereaux&#x27;s.)

==Awards and honors==
*Academy Award nomination: Best Sound (Donald O. Mitchell, Douglas O. Williams, Richard Tyler, and Harold M. Etherington)
* Nomination: Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy — Gene Wilder
* Writers Guild of America nomination: Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen – Colin Higgins
* The film was chosen for the Royal Film Performance in 1977.
* In 2000, American Film Institute included the film in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #95.

==Score and soundtrack==
Though the film dates to 1976, Henry Mancini&#x27;s score was never officially released on a soundtrack album. Intrada Records&#x27; 2002 compilation became one of the year&#x27;s best-selling special releases.

<text>Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, the Abbé ([[Abbot]]) of [[Saint-Cyran-en-Brenne Abbey|Saint-Cyran]], (1581 – 6 October 1643) was a French Catholic priest who introduced Jansenism into France.

==Life==
Born in the city of Bayonne to a family of Gascon and Basque merchants, Vergier studied with the Jesuits of Agen. At the age of sixteen he was sent to study at the Sorbonne, and then took up theology at the Catholic University of Leuven. There he formed a friendship with Cornelius Jansen and, as the wealthier of the two, became Jansen&#x27;s patron for a number of years, getting Jansen a job as a tutor in 1606. Two years later, he obtained for Jansen a position teaching at the episcopal college back in Bayonne. The duo spent 1611–1614 there, in seclusion in a house belonging to his family, where they studied the Church Fathers together, with a special focus on the thought of Augustine of Hippo, until Jansen left Bayonne in 1614 to return to the Dutch Republic.

In 1617 Vergier left Bayonne at the invitation of Henri-Louis Chasteigner de La Roche-Posay, the Bishop of Poitiers, where he soon became a leading figure of the diocese. He was ordained a priest in 1618. In 1620 he became the commendatory abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Cyran and was thus generally known as the Abbé de Saint-Cyran for the rest of his life. The new commendatory prelate resided little in his abbey. During that same year, he made the acquaintance of the mystic, Charles de Condren, and through him Pierre de Bérulle, founder of the French Oratory, under whose influence, he adopted an Augustinian Christocentrism. He also became friends with Robert Arnauld d&#x27;Andilly, through whom he became connected with the Arnauld family.

Vergier kept up his correspondence with Jansen, urging him to prepare his book &quot;Augustinus&quot;, the source of the Jansenist teachings. He also became spiritual director and confessor of the nuns of the abbey of Port-Royal des Champs, in whose history the Arnauld family played significant roles. Under his leadership from 1633 to 1636 the abbey became a center of Jansenism.

After the death of his friend Bérulle in 1629, Vergier became the leader of a group of devotees, allied with the Parlement of Paris, which brought him into conflict with the French Prime Minister, Cardinal Richelieu. In 1638, Richelieu had him imprisoned at Vincennes, where he remained until after the cardinal&#x27;s death in 1642. He himself died shortly after in Paris in 1643, having lived long enough to hear of the condemnation of Jansen&#x27;s teachings by Pope Urban VIII the previous year.

==Works==
Together with Jansen, Saint-Cyran insisted that love of God was fundamental, and that only contrition, and not simple attrition (imperfect contrition), could save a person. The debate between the respective roles of contrition and attrition was one of the motives of his imprisonment. However, he remained hesitant on this matter, and in prison signed a declaration in favor of attrition.

<text>Sir Edward James Salisbury CBE FRS (16 April 1886 – 10 November 1978) was an English botanist and ecologist. He was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire and graduated in botany from University College London in 1905. In 1913, he obtained a D.Sc. with a thesis on fossil seeds and was appointed a senior lecturer at East London College. He returned to University College London as a senior lecturer, from 1924 as a reader in plant ecology and from 1929 as Quain Professor of botany.

Salisbury was director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew from 1943 to 1956. He was responsible for the restoration of the gardens after the Second World War.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 15 March 1933 and won the society&#x27;s Royal Medal in 1945 for &quot;his notable contributions to plant ecology and to the study of the British flora generally&quot;. In 1936, he was awarded The Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society in acknowledgement of his book &quot;The Living Garden&quot; (1935), which was enormously popular. In 1939, he received the Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1946 he was knighted.

At first, his research was focussed on forest ecology, particularly in his native Hertfordshire. Later, he pioneered investigations of seed size and reproductive output of plants in relation to habitat. He also investigated the ecology of garden weeds and of dune plants.

He was elected President of the Sussex Wildlife Trust in January 1962, where he remained in office until April 1967.

<doc id="633717" wikidata="Q1543799" url="?curid=633717" title="Putting-out system">
<text>The putting-out system is a means of subcontracting work, like a tailor. Historically, it was also known as the workshop system and the domestic system. In putting-out, work is contracted by a central agent to subcontractors who complete the project via remote work. It was used in the English and American textile industries, in shoemaking, lock-making trades, and making parts for small firearms from the Industrial Revolution until the mid-19th century. After the invention of the sewing machine in 1846, the system lingered on for the making of ready-made men&#x27;s clothing.

The domestic system was suited to pre-urban times because workers did not have to travel from home to work, which was quite unfeasible due to the state of roads and footpaths, and members of the household spent many hours in farm or household tasks. Early factory owners sometimes had to build dormitories to house workers, especially girls and women. Putting-out workers had some flexibility to balance farm and household chores with the putting-out work, this being especially important in winter.

The development of this trend is often considered to be a form of proto-industrialization, and remained prominent until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.

At that point, it underwent name and geographical changes. However, bar some technological advancements, the putting-out system has not changed in essential practice. Contemporary examples can be found in China, India, and South America, and are not limited to the textiles industry.

== Firearms ==

Historian David A. Hounshell writes: 

All of the processes were carried out under different cottage roofs. It was replaced by inside contracting and the factory system.

== European cloth and other trades ==

The &quot;domestic system&quot; was a popular system of cloth production in Europe. It was also used in various other industries, including the manufacture of wrought iron ironware such as pins, pots, and pans for ironmongers.

It existed as early as the 15th century, but was most prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries. It served as a way for employers and workers to bypass the guild system, which was thought to be cumbersome and inflexible, and to access a rural labor force. Having the workers work in their homes was convenient for both parties. Workers were working remotely, manufacturing individual articles from raw materials, then bringing them to a central place of business, such as a marketplace or a larger town, to be assembled and sold. In other cases travelling agents or traders would tour the villages, supplying the raw materials and collecting the finished goods. The raw materials were often provided by the merchant, who received the finished product, hence the synonymous term &quot;putting-out system&quot;. The advantages of this system were that workers involved could work at their own speed, and children working in the system were better treated than they would have been in the factory system, although the homes might be polluted by the toxins from the raw materials. As the woman of a family usually worked at home, someone was often there to look after any children. The domestic system is often cited as one of the causes of the rise of the nuclear family in Europe, as the workers&#x27; earnings made them less dependent on their extended family. This often led to more prosperity among workers, with more furniture, and better food and clothing than they had had before. It was mostly centralized in Western Europe and did not take a strong hold in Eastern Europe.

Thomas Hood&#x27;s poem &quot;The Song of the Shirt&quot; (1843) describes the wretched life of a woman in Lambeth labouring under such a system. It was written in honour of a woman who is known only as Mrs. Biddell, a Lambeth widow and seamstress who lived in a state of poverty. In what was, at that time, common practice, she sewed trousers and shirts in her home using materials given to her by her employer, for which she was forced to give a £2 deposit. In a desperate attempt to feed her starving infants, Mrs. Biddell pawned the clothing she had made, thus accruing a debt that she could not repay. Biddell was sent to a workhouse, and her ultimate fate is unknown; however, her story motivated those who actively opposed the wretched conditions of England&#x27;s working poor, who often spent seven days a week labouring under inhuman conditions, barely managing to survive and with no prospect of relief.

Anders Jonsson (1816–1890) was a famous Swedish entrepreneur who continued a putting-out business at Holsljunga. He contracted up to 200 domestic workers, who came to his house to get the raw material and returned after a couple of weeks with textiles, which local pedlars from the city of Borås then bought and went out to sell, among other things, around Sweden and Norway.

== Cottage industry ==


A cottage industry is an industry—primarily manufacturing—which includes many producers, working from their homes, and was often organized through the putting-out system. The biggest participants in this system were the merchant capitalist and the rural worker. The merchant would &quot;put-out&quot; basic materials to the cottage workers, who then prepared the materials in their own homes and returned the finished merchandise back to the merchant. The term originally referred to home workers who were engaged in a task such as sewing, lace-making, wall hangings, or household manufacturing. Some industries which are nowadays usually operated from large, centralized factories were cottage industries before the Industrial Revolution. Business operators would travel around the world, buying raw materials, delivering them to people who would work on them, and then collecting the finished goods to sell, or typically to ship to another market. One of the factors which allowed the Industrial Revolution to take place in Western Europe was the presence of these business people who had the ability to expand the scale of their operations. In Russia, the &quot;Kustar&quot; were rural artisans engaged in cottage industries. Such industries were very common at a time when much of the population was engaged in agriculture, because the farmers and their families often had both the time and the desire to earn additional income during the part of the year (winter) when there was little work to do farming or selling produce.

<doc id="633719" wikidata="Q168087" url="?curid=633719" title="2747 Český Krumlov">
<text>2747 Český Krumlov (), provisional designation , is a carbonaceous asteroid and slow rotator from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 22 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos at Kleť Observatory on 19 February 1980, and named for the Czech town of Český Krumlov.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Český Krumlov&quot; belongs to the Hygiea family. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.5 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,991 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic.

It was first identified as at Almaty Observatory () in 1953. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins four weeks later with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory, 27 years prior to its official discovery observation at Klet Observatory.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Český Krumlov&quot; has been characterized as an X-type and carbonaceous C-type asteroid.

=== Slow rotator ===

In October 2010, a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Český Krumlov&quot; was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 438.7098 hours with a brightness variation of 0.63 magnitude (). This makes it a very slow rotator.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Český Krumlov&quot; measures between 22.51 and 36.33 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.028 and 0.06.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 20.62 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.16.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the historic Czech town of Český Krumlov, near to the location of the discovering Kleť Observatory. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 29 November 1993 ().

<text>The Stonewall Inn (also known as Stonewall) is a gay bar and recreational tavern at 53 Christopher Street in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan in New York City. It was the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots, which led to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States. When the riots occurred, Stonewall was one of the relatively few gay bars in New York City. The original gay bar occupied two structures at 51–53 Christopher Street, which were built as horse stables in the 1840s.

The original Stonewall Inn was founded in 1930 as a speakeasy on Seventh Avenue South. It relocated in 1934 to Christopher Street, where it operated as a restaurant until 1966. Four mafiosos associated with the Genovese crime family bought the restaurant and reopened it as a gay bar in early 1967. The Stonewall Inn was a popular hangout for gay men, particularly for youth and those on the fringes of the gay community. Stonewall operated as a private club because it was not allowed to obtain a liquor license; police raided the bar frequently, in spite of bribes from the owners. The Stonewall riots of June 28 to July 3, 1969, took place following one such raid.

The bar went out of business shortly after the riots, and the two buildings were divided and leased to various businesses over the years. In 1990, Jimmy Pisano opened a new bar at 53 Christopher Street, which was initially named New Jimmy&#x27;s before becoming Stonewall. After Pisano&#x27;s death in 1994, his boyfriend Thomas Garguilo took over the bar, followed by Dominic DeSimone and Bob Gurecki. The Stonewall Inn closed in 2006, and it reopened in March 2007 after Bill Morgan, Tony DeCicco, Kurt Kelly, and Stacy Lentz acquired the bar. The structure at 51 Christopher Street became a visitor center for the Stonewall National Monument in the 2020s.

The buildings themselves are architecturally undistinguished, with facades of brick and stucco, while the original bar&#x27;s interior has been modified significantly over the years. The modern bar hosts various events and performances, and its owners also operate an LGBT advocacy organization. The Stonewall Inn became a tourist attraction and a symbol of the LGBT community after the riots, and various works of media about the bar have been created over the years. In part because of its impact on LGBT culture, the Stonewall Inn is the first LGBT cultural site designated as a National Historic Landmark and a New York City designated landmark. The bar is also part of the Stonewall National Monument, the first U.S. National Monument dedicated to the LGBT rights movement.

== Background and early history ==
The Stonewall Inn buildings at 51–53 Christopher Street, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, were constructed as double-height horse stables. The older of the two buildings is 51 Christopher Street, which was built in 1843 by A. Voorhis and expanded to three stories in 1898. The other structure, 53 Christopher Street, was built in 1846; it was originally used by Mark Spencer before becoming a bakery operated by Baptiste Ycre in 1914. The then-owner of the buildings, Henry J. Harper, hired the architect William Bayard in 1930 to combine and redesign the structures in the Arts &amp; Crafts style. The two structures were reclad in stucco, and the third story atop 51 Christopher Street was removed. The ground floor continued to host a bakery until 1933, while the Ycre family lived on the second floor.

Meanwhile, Vincent Bonavia had opened Bonnie&#x27;s Stone Wall (or Bonnie&#x27;s Stonewall) at 91 Seventh Avenue South, near the Christopher Street buildings, in 1930. Bonnie&#x27;s Stonewall might have been named after &quot;The Stone Wall&quot;, a lesbian autobiography by Mary Casal. The historian David Carter wrote that, even in the 1930s, this may have been an attempt to subtly welcome queer women. The bar was a secret speakeasy that illegally sold alcohol during Prohibition in the United States; as a consequence, it was raided in December 1930. Bonavia relocated to 51–53 Christopher Street in 1934, after Prohibition was repealed. The architect Harry Yarish installed a large vertical sign on the facade and a doorway with columns around the entrance to 53 Christopher Street. The interior was designed in the style of a hunting lodge.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) wrote that, despite a lack of documentation on Stonewall&#x27;s early history, &quot;sources suggest that it was among the most notorious of the tearooms operating in the Village in the early 1930s&quot;. The restaurant hosted various banquets and weddings, as well as events including a 1935 dinner for the Greenwich Village Association and a 1961 reunion party for performers involved with the play &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;. The eatery had become Bonnie&#x27;s Stonewall Inn by the 1940s and the Stonewall Inn Restaurant by the 1950s or 1960s. The interior of the restaurant was destroyed by fire in the 1960s, and the structures at 51 through 61 Christopher Street were sold in March 1965. Sources disagree over whether the new owner was Burt and Lucille Handelsman or Joel Weiser. The restaurant had definitely shuttered by 1966. After the restaurant closed, the buildings were vacant; the signs above the ground-story windows were removed, and the second story of the facade was patched.

== Original gay bar ==

=== Renovation and conversion ===
Greenwich Village had become an LGBT neighborhood as early as the 1930s. The neighborhood&#x27;s LGBT community was originally concentrated around Greenwich Avenue and Washington Square Park, but, by the 1960s, had started to move westward along Christopher Street. To cater to the growing LGBT community, in 1966, four mafiosos associated with the Genovese crime family paid $3,500 for the Stonewall Inn, turning the restaurant into a gay bar. The team of owners were led by &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Lauria; he paid $2,000 for the restaurant, and three other mobsters named Zookie Zarfas, Tony the Sniff, and Joey paid $500 each. It was one of several gay bars operated by the Genovese syndicate in New York City. Matty Ianniello, a Genovese mafioso who controlled various mob-operated bars, collected a portion of the bar&#x27;s profits.

The owners believed that a business catering to the LGBT community might turn a profit; in return, they demanded regular payoffs for protection. Stonewall&#x27;s owners could not obtain a liquor license because state law in the 1960s did not allow bartenders to legally serve LGBT people. At the time, the New York State Liquor Authority (NYSLA) regarded any LGBT person in a bar as engaging in disorderly conduct. Frequent raids against gay bars forced most to close, except for those operated by mobsters. Furthermore, gay people who were arrested risked losing their jobs, homes, and families. By contrast, members of private clubs could bring their own alcoholic beverages under New York state law. Accordingly, Lauria and his co-owners acquired a private club&#x27;s license for Stonewall, as they intended to serve LGBT people without obtaining a license from the NYSLA.

After acquiring the buildings, the owners renovated the exterior, blacked out the windows for privacy, and reinforced the wooden front doors with steel plates in anticipation of police raids. The new operators added peepholes and several locks to the front doors, and they removed the columns that flanked the original entrance. The operators also placed 2×4 pieces of wood behind the windows so the police could not easily enter through the windows during a raid. The interior was painted black because that color was used in other gay bars and it would hide the interior&#x27;s burn damage. The new owners retained the Stonewall Restaurant&#x27;s old name so they did not have to replace the exterior sign (although the word &quot;restaurant&quot; was officially dropped from the name, that word was not painted over on the sign). At the time of the conversion, LGBT bars and straight bars had similar facades, though LGBT bars tended to have an intentionally rundown appearance so straight patrons would be discouraged from going to these bars.

=== Operation ===

Stonewall opened as a gay bar on March 18, 1967. It had two dance floors in addition to a long bar, jukebox, tables, and seating booths. The facade was nondescript, and the only external indication of the club&#x27;s existence was a small sign proclaiming that it was a private, members-only club. When it opened, Stonewall &quot;was a small gay bar just like any other&quot;, as the LGBT newspaper &quot;Gay News&quot; would later describe it. Its manager was Ed Murphy (also known as the Skull), an ex-convict who was known for sitting motionless around the bar and watching patrons.

==== Clientele ====
Visitors were greeted by bouncers who inspected them through the peepholes in the door. The bouncers accepted almost any LGBT individual who wanted to enter, but they screened out straight patrons and undercover police officers. Admission was granted to would-be patrons who &quot;looked gay&quot; or who had visited the club before, as well as new patrons who were accompanied by someone that could vouch for them. People under the legal drinking age were frequently admitted. In keeping with private club regulations, patrons were required to sign a logbook upon entry; the logbook also served to screen out straight patrons. The visitor logbook frequently contained pseudonyms such as Donald Duck, Elizabeth Taylor, and Judy Garland. If a visitor wished to leave the bar and return the same night, the bouncers would stamp their hand with individual ink. Any customer who passed the screening process paid an admission fee of $3 on weekends and $1 on weekdays.

Patrons were predominantly in their teens or early twenties, though men in their late twenties and early thirties congregated around the main room&#x27;s bar. Most patrons were young gay men of various races and occupations, though Stonewall did also accept women (regardless of sexuality), transsexuals, and transvestites. It is unknown to what extent women patronized the bar, though several observers interviewed by David Carter described the bar as being almost exclusively male. These observers also said that almost all of the lesbians at Stonewall were butch lesbians. Due to differing terminologies used in the late 1960s, it is also unknown to what extent transvestites visited the bar, but Carter writes that the number of transsexual and transvestite customers was not insignificant. Many homeless young men slept across the street in Christopher Park and would often try to enter so customers would buy them drinks.

The Stonewall Inn was a popular hangout for gay men. The bar was called &quot;one of the most active spots in town currently; very crowded on weekends&quot; in a 1968 guidebook, and it was New York City&#x27;s only gay bar that allowed open dancing. It was also located on a busy road and was cheaper than comparable gay bars. The artist Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt recalled that Stonewall was one of the only bars in the city where couples could slow dance together, while the historian Martin Duberman said that the bar was frequented by a &quot;non-vanilla mix of people: people in suits and ties, street hustlers, drag queens, a few dope pushers, a fair number of nonwhites&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called the bar a &quot;mecca&quot; for the LGBT community in the neighborhood, and &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that &quot;Here the young men with the delicate wrists and the bobby pins in their hair come to dance the night away with one another&quot;. One contemporary patron described the bar as being accepting of &quot;anyone who was in the margins of gay society&quot;, but that this gave the bar a &quot;trashy, low, and tawdry&quot; feel. Homeless youth and drag queens frequented the bar by 1969; it was one of the only places where they were socially accepted, and the admission fee meant that additional drinks did not require a tab. Other LGBT patrons shunned Stonewall because of its mob ownership and the drag queens&#x27; presence.

==== Ambiance and activities ====
As a private club, Stonewall was not legally allowed to accept money for drinks, and each customer was given two tickets that could be exchanged for drinks. Different-colored tickets were used each day to prevent patrons from saving up drink tickets. The Stonewall Inn&#x27;s operators pressured customers to buy drinks almost as soon as they entered. Each drink cost a dollar, more than in contemporary bars, even though they were watered-down drinks that were, in many cases, acquired illegally. The owners could earn up to $5,000 on Fridays and $6,500 on Saturdays, and, given the monthly rent of $300, recouped their $3,500 investment soon after opening. The cash registers were taken the first time the New York City Police Department (NYPD) raided the bar; thereafter, Stonewall&#x27;s income was stored in cigar boxes. The activist Craig Rodwell described Stonewall as &quot;one of the [...] more financially lucrative of the Mafia&#x27;s gay bars in Manhattan&quot;.

The spaces were poorly lit, giving it the impression of a dive bar. At the rear of the bar, the men&#x27;s restroom had its own attendant, and the women&#x27;s restroom had a red lightbulb. The main room&#x27;s bar lacked running water, forcing barkeeps to run dirty glasses through rubber tubs and immediately reuse them. The bar had a poor sound system, and the toilets were regularly clogged, giving the Stonewall Inn a reputation for filthiness. The buildings, at the time, did not have a rear emergency exit, which not only precluded Stonewall from receiving a liquor license but also created a fire hazard. Additionally, the bar&#x27;s employees were known to have engaged in blackmail. In the 1969 edition of the New York Mattachine Society&#x27;s guidebook to gay clubs around the city, there was a notation advising would-be patrons against giving out any personally identifying information at the Stonewall Inn, especially to employees. The bar was not openly used for prostitution, but drug sales and other cash transactions did take place, and Carter wrote that &quot;there is little doubt&quot; that a prostitution ring operated out of the second story. Six months before the Stonewall riots, the bar had reportedly been the source of a small outbreak of hepatitis.

Despite the poor conditions, the Stonewall Inn&#x27;s popularity endured. Stonewall was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed, and dancing was its main draw after it opened as a gay club. Of the two bar rooms, the main room to the east typically played mainstream rock. There was a jukebox behind the bar in the main room; patrons could pay to have a song played on the jukebox. In addition to dancing, the main room was a popular place for gay men to congregate and cruise, and there were a small number of tables with candles. There was typically a single waiter in the main room, which was often called the &quot;white room&quot; because of its music and clientele.

The back room, to the west, mostly played soul music. It was called the black room or the Puerto Rican room, as it was frequented by black and Hispanic customers, as well as youth. The back room was even more dimly lit than the main room, and it had numerous waiters, all of whom cajoled guests to buy drinks. The south end of the back room, near Christopher Street, was occupied by &quot;the most marginal of the Stonewall&#x27;s customers&quot;. Around 1968, the owners removed a partition in 51 Christopher Street to create a dance floor, while another partition was installed in 53 Christopher Street. Alice Echols, in a 2010 book, cited the two dance floors as possibly having &quot;helped to undermine the sort of sexual indirection and repression that characterized most gay bars&quot;.

==== Bribes and raids ====
The bar&#x27;s lack of a license made it vulnerable to police raids. The owners gave cash bribes to the NYPD&#x27;s 6th Precinct (within which the bar was located) to stave off raids. A magazine article, published five months after the bar&#x27;s opening, implied that the bar paid the police around $1,200 a month. Some observers such as the activist Craig Rodwell objected to the payoffs because of the corruption involved. In addition, despite these payoffs, Stonewall was raided once a month on average, and it was raided even more frequently before elections or when local residents complained. Seymour Pine, a police inspector who later led the raid that caused the Stonewall riots, said his team frequently raided gay bars because LGBT people did not fight back when they were arrested. Pine recalled that limousines carrying wealthy patrons would come to the bar on Saturdays, so he tried to avoid raiding the bar on these nights.

The bar&#x27;s management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. There were white floodlights inside the bar, which could be activated in case of a raid. Many bars kept extra liquor nearby so they could resume business as quickly as possible if alcohol was seized. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification were often arrested, along with the bar&#x27;s staff. Also liable to be arrested were people who did not wear at least three pieces of gender-conforming clothing, such as men in full drag. Anyone who was detained in a raid was often released within hours, and as a result the staff were unconcerned about being arrested.

By June 1969, campaigning for that year&#x27;s mayoral election had precipitated frequent raids in local bars, including one at the Stonewall Inn less than a week before the Stonewall riots. The raids targeted not only gay bars but also straight bars frequented by minorities, and several clubs in Greenwich Village closed because of these raids. According to Rodwell and the novelist Edmund White, the new captain of the NYPD&#x27;s 6th Precinct had ordered the raids in Greenwich Village. In a 1987 retrospective, Robert Amsel wrote in the LGBT magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; that many LGBT people were in favor of the raids because they did not want the bars to be operated by the mafia; according to Amsel, these critics did not see that &quot;without the mafia&#x27;s money, there might not have been any gay bars to legitimize&quot;.

=== Uprising ===

The Stonewall riots started in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969. According to a &quot;Daily News&quot; article from the time, the NYPD had obtained a warrant to raid the bar because it was illegally serving liquor; later accounts said the raid was precipitated by an anonymous tip that the Mafia was trading stolen bonds. In any case, it was the first time the NYPD did not give the managers advance notice of a raid. Around 1:20 a.m., a team of eight undercover officers, led by Pine, raided the bar. As was customary, the police began to check patrons&#x27; identification. The routine raid did not go as planned, as patrol wagons for the arrested patrons took longer to arrive than expected. A scuffle broke out when a butch lesbian in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. The police tried to restrain some of the crowd and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Eventually, the police were barricaded inside; the crowd was not cleared until 4:00 a.m.

Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken in the riots, and what little liquor remained was given away for free afterward. Stonewall&#x27;s windows were covered with boards the night of the riots, and graffitied messages in support of LGBT rights and gay bars appeared on the bar&#x27;s facade the day afterward. The riot was covered in the city&#x27;s major media outlets, including in radio and newspapers. Another demonstration took place on June 29; it attracted hundreds of protesters of all sexualities. Activity in Greenwich Village was sporadic over the next two days due to inclement weather, but another riot took place on July 2. The riots ultimately ended on July 3, when the NYPD dispersed the protests. Allen Ginsberg, a beat poet who witnessed the riots, said that &quot;the guys there were so beautiful—they&#x27;ve lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago&quot;.

== After the riots ==

=== 1960s to 1980s ===

==== Closure and relocation ====

By the end of 1969, the Stonewall Inn had closed; sources disagree on whether it was shuttered in October or in December. Carter writes that the bar&#x27;s downfall may have been because of its infamy, the fact that it had no liquor license, and resentment toward the mafiosos who operated the bar. Pine claimed that he had been ordered to raid the bar because it was blackmailing wealthy patrons, but Carter could not find evidence to corroborate this claim. A &quot;Newsday&quot; article from 1970 described Stonewall as &quot;still a battered, broken place, with a &quot;For Rent&quot; sign on it now&quot;.

Another Stonewall opened at 211 22nd Street in Miami Beach, Florida, in 1972. Two patrons there filed a lawsuit against the local police chief in 1973, asserting malicious harassment. The Miami Beach establishment burned down shortly before 7:00 a.m. on March 2, 1974, following a suspected arson.

==== Commercial conversion ====
Manny E. Duell, the operator of a holding company named 51 to 61 Christopher Corp., took over the buildings in March 1970. The owners submitted alteration plans to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New York City Department of Buildings in late 1970, as they sought to convert 51 to 53 Christopher Street into a restaurant and non-alcoholic bar. The new venue would have retained most of the 1967 bar&#x27;s interior decorations, but the architects planned to replace the damaged doors and windows. By 1973, the original gay bar had been divided into two storefronts at the ground level and apartments on the second story. The Gay Activists Alliance planned to install a plaque on the buildings, as it did not have enough money to buy the structures for preservation purposes. There were numerous attempts to install a commemorative plaque or a statue on or near the bar buildings, but these efforts received criticisms for failing to sufficiently acknowledge nonwhite or transgender people.

LPC documents show that, in 1975, Duell leased out the two storefronts there as distinct spaces. Thereafter, the buildings were used by a variety of businesses, and subsequent renovations removed all of the original gay bar&#x27;s decorations. Documents indicate that the owners of 51 Christopher Street filed plans to widen that building&#x27;s entrance in August 1975. The structure at 53 Christopher had become a bagel shop known as Bagels And by 1976. Mimi Sheraton, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article from that year, described 53 Christopher Street as having wood-paneled walls, wood columns, and rhombus-shaped mirrors, giving the appearance of a &quot;never-ending abstract forest&quot;. A commemorative plaque was installed on the facade in 1979 on the tenth anniversary of the riots.

After serving as a bagel shop, 53 Christopher Street became a Chinese restaurant, known as the Szechuan Cottage Restaurant. Sources disagree on when the changeover occurred. The LPC writes that the Chinese restaurant was in operation by 1982, when the restaurant altered the building without the agency&#x27;s permission, but a 1985 description of the site characterizes the bagel shop as still being located within the Stonewall site. A bar named Stonewall opened in 51 Christopher Street in 1987. New York City mayor Ed Koch proposed co-naming the stretch of Christopher Street outside Stonewall Inn as Stonewall Place in early 1989, and the New York City Council overwhelmingly approved the plan that April. The new street signs were installed at the beginning of that June. The bar at number 51 closed in 1989, upon which the sign on the building&#x27;s facade was disassembled. By the early 1990s, the building at 51 Christopher Street had become a men&#x27;s clothing store.

=== Revival at 53 Christopher Street ===

==== Reopening ====
A gay bar named New Jimmy&#x27;s opened at the Stonewall site in May 1990, serving the city&#x27;s growing outwardly LGBT community. The space was operated by Jimmy Pisano, a first-time bar owner who, according to his boyfriend Thomas Garguilo, was initially loath to name the bar &quot;Stonewall&quot; because of the sudden closure of the similarly named bar next door. Rather, Pisano initially named the bar after Jimmy Merry, who had taught him how to operate a bar. New Jimmy&#x27;s occupied only the space at 53 Christopher Street and was unrelated to the original bar. Dominic DeSimone was hired to renovate the space; he wanted to restore the bar to its 1960s-era condition, but critics such as David Carter expressed concerns that the new operators wanted to exploit the bar&#x27;s name for commercial purposes. A commemorative plaque was also installed outside the bar&#x27;s entrance. In a contrast to the first iteration of the gay bar, the NYPD did not raid the revived Stonewall Inn, and gay officers sometimes even ordered drinks from the bar.

New Jimmy&#x27;s was renamed Stonewall in 1991. During the early 1990s, Stonewall gained a poor reputation among neighborhood residents after several incidents in which the police were called to remove drug dealers there. Stonewall also suffered from low patronage due to competition from other taverns; according to DeSimone, Stonewall frequently did not see more than 50 or 60 patrons even on its busiest nights. Garguilo similarly said that the bar was often empty in the three years after it reopened. Pisano died of AIDS-related complications in early 1994, and Garguilo took over operation, as he wanted the bar to be open for the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. According to Garguilo, so many people came to commemorate the riots&#x27; 25th anniversary that there was a line to take pictures of the bar. DeSimone and Pisano&#x27;s business partner Bob Gurecki took over Stonewall in the mid-1990s.

==== DeSimone takeover ====

At the end of 1996, Ben Duell, who owned the building, refused to renew DeSimone&#x27;s lease unless the latter agreed to expand the bar into the vacant second story. The space at 53 Christopher Street was renovated into a multi-floor nightclub at a cost of $200,000. it included a 95-seat bar room on the second floor. DeSimone needed a permit to operate a dance club within the bar, as it was less than 100 feet from a residential building, but the local Manhattan Community Board 2 unanimously voted against giving him a dance-club permit in early 1997. Despite not having a dance permit, DeSimone decided to open a dance floor on the second story in June 1997, prompting complaints from residents of the nearby condominium building at 45 Christopher Street. By 1999, number 51 was still a clothing store. The bar at number 53 sold souvenirs and was one of several remaining gay bars on the street.

The bar buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1999 and further designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2000. Due to repeated noise complaints, by the 2000s, patrons were required to enter through an adjacent building on Seventh Avenue South, rather than the main Christopher Street entrance. The city government charged the club&#x27;s owners with several safety violations during this decade. According to one member of Manhattan Community Board 2, the owners were reportedly closing curtains (which was disallowed because the club held a New York state liquor license) and allowing sexually explicit shows inside.

By early 2006, Stonewall&#x27;s beverage suppliers were suing its operators. The LGBT community generally either did not know the bar was open or were not interested in the events hosted there. In the bar itself, there were no indications of the riots that had taken place there, except for framed newspaper articles on the walls. &quot;The Pink News&quot; attributed the bar&#x27;s decline to long-running resentment between different groups of patrons, but neglect, gross mismanagement, and noise complaints from neighbors were also cited as reasons for its downfall. The bar was forced to close again later in 2006 after losing its liquor license, and the storefront at number 53 was available for rent by that August. Stonewall&#x27;s furnishings, such as bar stools, were placed on sale. At that point, Stonewall&#x27;s monthly rent was $20,000, making it unlikely that it would reopen as a bar. Kurt Kelly, a local businessman who later helped take over the bar, said: &quot;This is gay history. It&#x27;s like abusing the Liberty Bell.&quot;

==== New management and visitor center ====
Around 2007, the bar was taken over by the businessmen Bill Morgan, Tony DeCicco, and Kurt Kelly, along with the bar&#x27;s first lesbian investor, Stacy Lentz. Morgan told the LGBT newspaper &quot;PinkNews&quot; that &quot;When we went looking for investors to save the Stonewall people came out of the woodwork. Gay and straight.&quot; An NPR reporter stated that the co-owners sought to renovate the bar to approximate its 1969 appearance, although they did not necessarily wish to operate the bar as a museum. The Stonewall Inn reopened in March 2007. Lentz hung a costume in the window to honor the actress Judy Garland, a gay icon who had died a few days before the riots; the costume resembled the dress worn by Garland&#x27;s character Dorothy in the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Kelly said that, after the bar reopened, other bars nearby saw increased business. The bar recorded few issues, other than sporadic violent incidents. One commentator for the &quot;Gay and Lesbian Review&quot;, said in 2009 that the modern bar&#x27;s &quot;crowd veers toward a random mix of tourists, city kids, and bridge-and-tunnel gays&quot; but that its symbolism was still important.

During the 2010s, the Stonewall Inn continued to attract regular customers, although a bartender described tourists as comprising most of the visitors. There was a gift shop behind the bar room. The neighboring structure, at 51 Christopher Street, was operating as a nail salon. The Duell family sold 51–53 Christopher Street and five other buildings in 2015 to a holding company associated with Alan Wasserman, which paid $57 million. After the Stonewall National Monument was established around the bar in 2016, the LGBT–rights organization Pride Live tried to develop a visitor center for the monument. Pride Live began negotiating with the owner of 51 Christopher Street in 2019, as the storefront there had been vacated. One of the bar&#x27;s longest-tenured staff members at the time—the bartender Tree Sequoia, who had been present during the riots—frequently told stories to visitors and was also Stonewall&#x27;s international ambassador. One commentator described the bar in 2019 as displaying sponsorship banners above the entrance, while the vacant storefront at 53 Christopher Street contained posters decrying violence against LGBT people.

The bar closed temporarily in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, and Stonewall&#x27;s owners unsuccessfully applied for a loan. Though the bar was allowed to start selling cocktails that June, it was in danger of closing permanently, so Kelly and Lentz launched two crowdfunding campaigns on GoFundMe; They raised at least $300,000 for the bar in one month, and the Gill Foundation provided another $250,000 in matching funds. Stonewall reopened in July 2020 with a limited capacity. The building at 51 Christopher Street was placed for sale in June 2021, but, after Pride Live and the owner of 51 Christopher Street came to an agreement, work on the visitor center there commenced in June 2022. MBB Architects designed the visitor center, and Local Projects was responsible for designing the exhibits. The visitor center opened on June 28, 2024, as the United States&#x27; first official national visitor center for LGBTQ culture. Numerous politicians and celebrities, including the singer Elton John and U.S. President Joe Biden, participated in the inauguration ceremonies, and the New York City Subway&#x27;s Christopher Street–Sheridan Square station was renamed the Christopher Street–Stonewall station on the same day.

==Buildings==
The first Stonewall Inn occupied a pair of repurposed horse stables at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, on the northern side of the street. The modern-day bar occupies only the structure at 53 Christopher Street. The neighboring building to the east, at 51 Christopher Street, opened in 2024 as the Stonewall National Monument&#x27;s visitor center. Because the structures were developed separately, the roof of number 51 is slightly higher than that of number 53, and there is a party wall separating both buildings. The two buildings share a land lot with five other structures; , these seven structures contained numerous storefronts and a combined 23 apartments.

Despite the bar&#x27;s significance to the LGBT community, David W. Dunlap of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;An architectural monument, Stonewall is not&quot;. Ginia Bellafante wrote for the same newspaper in 2015 that the buildings were architecturally undistinguished but received an &quot;A for meaning&quot;.

=== Surroundings ===
Directly south of the two structures is Christopher Park, a pocket park between Christopher, West 4th, and Grove streets. In tribute to the riots, the park has contained the &quot;Gay Liberation&quot; statue by George Segal since 1992. It also displayed a sculpture named &quot;A Love Letter to Marsha&quot; (a temporary tribute to the transgender activist Marsha P. Johnson, who was present during the riots) during 2021. The New York City Subway&#x27;s is next to the park. The station&#x27;s artwork includes a triptych that depicts the riots, and the station itself was renamed after Stonewall National Monument in 2024.

A crosswalk at Christopher Street and Seventh Avenue South to the west, the closest intersection to the Stonewall Inn, has been painted in the colors of the LGBT rainbow flag since 2017. To the east, Christopher Street intersects Grove Street, Waverly Place (twice), and Gay Street. Parts of these roads are protected on the National Register of Historic Places along with the bar itself.

=== Facade ===
On both buildings, the facade of the ground story is mostly made of brick, while the second floor is clad with stucco. The building at 53 Christopher Street is two stories high and divided vertically into three bays. At ground level, the center of number 53&#x27;s facade contains a rectangular, storefront window with a brick windowsill, which in turn is flanked by arched entrances. The entrance to the left is a narrow semicircular arch. The entrance to the right is a segmental arch, with wooden double doors. On the second story, the stucco facade is scored horizontally, and there is a rectangular iron flower-box holder beneath each of the three windows. By the 21st century, a neon sign with the bar&#x27;s name was ordinarily placed in the window, while pride flags were hung on the facade.

The building at 51 Christopher Street is two stories high (previously three), with a one-story rear annex, and is four bays wide. At ground level, the left half of number 51&#x27;s facade contains a rectangular, storefront window with a brick windowsill, similar to the window at number 53. Immediately to the right is a segmental arch, with a fanlight above wooden double doors. The bay furthest to the right has a stucco facade at ground level, with a rectangular door leading to the second floor. On the second story, the stucco facade is scored horizontally, and there is a curved iron flower-box holder beneath each of the four windows. At the time of the 1969 riots, the second floor of number 51 had a vertical sign, though this has since been removed. There was also a stoop at 51 Christopher Street&#x27;s entrance, which was removed when the building became a visitor center.

=== Interior ===

==== Original gay bar ====

When the Stonewall Inn was turned into an LGBT bar, the bar was split into two primary rooms, one in each building. The bar had almost no decoration and scant lighting, and what little decoration did exist was destroyed on the first day of the Stonewall riots. Aside from black paint, the spaces had temporary wooden bars. According to a description of the bar from the 1960s, the decoration was so sparse that it looked &quot;to have only recently been converted from a garage into a cabaret in about eight hours and at a cost of under fifty dollars&quot;.

Originally, service spaces such as the coat room were placed at the front of the bar, likely to limit outsiders&#x27; views of the interior. Visitors entered straight into a tiny vestibule. There was an office or coat check to the left of the main entrance, immediately behind the front window of 53 Christopher Street. A wishing well was found just inside the doorway. The main bar room was to the right, within 51 Christopher Street, through a doorway and down a single step. The main room had a long bar with narrow stools, and there was a dance floor at the rear. Swinging doors led from the main room, up one step, to the back room at 53 Christopher Street. The back room contained a bar at its rear. Toward the rear of the bar were the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s restrooms, which had doors from both the main and back rooms.

==== Later configuration ====
The interior of the original Stonewall Inn was divided into two spaces and redesigned after the original bar closed. The bar at 53 Christopher Street, and the visitor center at 51 Christopher Street, function as separate entities. 53 Christopher Street largely retains its original layout, but the finishes have been completely replaced. The ground floor&#x27;s interior decorations include a mirror occupying one wall, as well as wood paneling along the other walls. A 2009 article on the bar characterized it as a nondescript space with stools and a pool table. There is also a side room with red lighting. Inside is the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor, which was established in 2019 to honor notable LGBT individuals. The modern bar has contained a variety of pride flags; banknotes collected from foreign visitors; pictures and newspaper clippings about the riots; and a sign indicating that the bar had been raided.

The second story of the revived bar includes a room with a capacity of 150 people; this dance floor has a stage, a disco ball, seats with leopard print upholstery, and velour curtains. A &quot;New York&quot; magazine article described the dance floor as having a &quot;bar mitzvah vibe&quot; because of its decoration. According to a 2019 account, there was also a basement performance space.

51 Christopher Street has been converted into a visitor center, containing interactive displays and exhibits about the bar and national monument. The visitor center includes a &quot;content story wall&quot; with information about people involved in the riot, a 1960s jukebox similar to the one used in the original bar, and a theater-like space with golden shovels bearing the names of the visitor center&#x27;s sponsors. There is also artwork, as well as information about the history of the building and the riots. The visitor center also includes restrooms and space for park rangers. The interior of the visitor center is decorated in white, and the doorway to the existing bar at 53 Christopher Street has been bricked up. One observer for the magazine &quot;Fast Company&quot; said the visitor center &quot;makes Stonewall a sanitary, consumable story&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; art critic Holland Cotter wrote of the visitor center&#x27;s &quot;informational softness&quot;.

== Drinks ==
The modern Stonewall Inn serves only drinks and not food. The drinks that have been served at the bar have included Off the Wall, a pomegranate-and-lime-juice cocktail. The bar&#x27;s official beer is Brooklyn Brewery&#x27;s Stonewall Inn IPA, a lemon and grapefruit IPA that is 4.5% alcohol by volume. Co-owner Stacy Lentz said in 2021 that she mainly wanted to sell beer brands made by LGBT–friendly companies, including Brooklyn Brewery, Gay Beer, and Dyke Beer. The bar stopped selling Anheuser-Busch brands such as Bud Light in 2021 because of Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s donations to numerous politicians who had introduced anti-LGBT legislation. Bud Light had been among the most popular beer brands sold at the bar when Stonewall stopped selling it.

A &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; review from 2009 described the beverages as &quot;unfussy and mainstream&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; rank the bar&#x27;s drinks as being moderately priced. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote in 2018: &quot;All that said, Stonewall is a fine place to sip a vodka soda and meet new friends.&quot;

== Events ==
The modern Stonewall Inn has hosted a variety of local music artists, drag shows, trivia nights, cabaret, karaoke, private parties, and same-sex wedding receptions. The bar hosts regular events such as karaoke and drag bingo to attract regular customers. Stonewall also hosted &quot;big gay happy hours&quot; and screened black-and-white films near the main bar room. &quot;Time Out New York&quot; described the bar in 2021 as being frequented by tourists during the day, while hosting dance parties at night. Kelly, Morgan, and Lentz have also presented fundraising events for LGBT nonprofit organizations. The bar has hosted celebrity performances such as those by Madonna in 2018 and Taylor Swift in 2019, as well as visits from other figures such as U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in 2023. By the 21st century, the Stonewall Inn frequently served as a gathering place for the LGBT community, especially after major events that affected LGBT people. These included celebrations in 2011, after the Marriage Equality Act legalized same-sex marriage in New York state; in 2013, after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; to recognize same-sex marriage on the federal level; and in 2015, after the Supreme Court decided in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; to repeal all state bans on same-sex marriage. People have also convened at the bar following negative events. For example, it served as a memorial after dozens of gay men were killed in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, and people protested at the bar in response to anti-LGBT actions taken by the first and second administrations of U.S. President Donald Trump. The bar has been the site of other LGBT–related events, such as a 2014 announcement by U.S. interior secretary Sally Jewell on LGBT historic sites and a 2015 gay marriage ceremony. Politicians have used the bar for campaign events, such as when New York City Councilwoman Christine Quinn ran in the 2013 New York City mayoral election.

== Advocacy ==
After Lentz took over the bar, she organized several events in support of LGBT rights, such as a 2013 rally for the legalization of same-sex marriage outside the bar. In 2017, Stonewall co-owners Bill Morgan, Stacy Lentz, and Kurt Kelly established the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, a nonprofit LGBT–rights advocacy organization. The organization has received proceeds from the sale of the Stonewall Inn IPA and the sale of objects commemorating the Stonewall riots&#x27; 50th anniversary. Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative has hosted events such as a 2020 concert co-hosted by German alcohol brand Jägermeister to raise money for nightlife workers. Since 2023, the organization has presented the Stonewall Inn Brick Awards Gala, an event honoring LGBT community leaders.

Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative also operates a program through which LGBT-friendly events could be designated as &quot;safe spaces&quot;. Developed in conjunction with six LGBT groups, by 2023, the program had been translated into multiple languages and was being implemented in other countries.

== Impact ==

=== Aftermath of the riots ===
Although the Stonewall riots were not the first LGBT protests, they were widely considered a watershed event for the gay liberation movement. Many subsequent studies of LGBT history in the U.S. were divided into pre- and post-Stonewall analyses. Many aspects of gay and lesbian culture from before the riots, such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied, and people became less afraid of being openly LGBT. The American LGBT community become more visible following the riots, and wider acceptance of the LGBT community led to the repeal of many anti-LGBT laws and regulations. Even after the closure of the bar, the Stonewall riots also inspired activist movements around the U.S. Within two years of the riots, gay-rights groups had been founded all over the U.S., such as the Gay Liberation Front and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. The riots also inspired the creation of organizations such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the riots may have influenced gay bars&#x27; design, as later gay bars tended to have areas where sexual contact was encouraged.

==== Neighborhood impact ====
In part because of the riots at the Stonewall Inn, LGBT businesses began to congregate around Christopher Street. By the early 1970s, other LGBT businesses had opened along the street, even as the bar itself had closed. A commentator for &quot;The Advocate&quot; wrote in 1972 that the riots had succeeded in associating Christopher Street&#x27;s name with LGBT culture, while a 1982 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article described the street, and particularly the bar&#x27;s site, as the &quot;birthplace of the gay rights movement in this country&quot;.

The bar itself became a symbol of the LGBT community. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 1999 that the Stonewall Inn was &quot;a powerful symbol of resistance&quot;. The Stonewall Inn has been contrasted with Julius Bar one block away (where LGBT activists staged sit-ins during the 1960s). For example, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote in 1994 that Stonewall &quot;seems to belong to another era, one that made the notion of protesting in neckties ludicrous&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Stonewall in 1999 as having more-radical patrons compared with Julius&#x27;s. The bar is also a tourist attraction, with thousands of annual visitors. The New York City government advertised the bar as a destination for people visiting LGBT cultural sites in 2009, and Stonewall has also been included on walking tours of LGBT sites.

==== Commemorations ====
Christopher Street Liberation Day, on June 28, 1970, marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots; it, along with other events hosted the same day in other cities, was the first Gay Pride march in U.S. history. The Pride march became the inspiration for gay pride parades in the United States and in many other countries. A Gay Pride march has been hosted in New York City on the final Sunday of June since the first parade in 1970, and the city government has declared June as Pride Month since 1979. Participants in each year&#x27;s parade typically passed by the Stonewall site to pray and take pictures. Over a million people attended a parade commemorating the 25th anniversary of the riots in 1994; although the main parade did not pass by the Stonewall Inn, a smaller, unofficial group did march near the bar.

As part of the Stonewall 45 exhibit in 2014, which commemorated the 45th anniversary of the riots, the Arcus Foundation and Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP) placed posters in the windows of businesses on Christopher Street, including the Stonewall Inn. After the creation of the Stonewall National Monument in 2016, Google.org donated $1 million toward a program to preserve the bar&#x27;s history; this became the Stonewall Forever interactive web app, launched in 2019. The bar hosted a rally as part of the Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019 event, which took place a half-century after the riots and, with 5 million spectators, was the largest international Pride celebration in history at the time.

=== Landmark designations ===

==== Historic district and early proposals ====
Both of the Christopher Street buildings are part of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission&#x27;s Greenwich Village Historic District, designated in April 1969, and are also part of a National Register of Historic Places district with the same name. Though the historic district designations provided partial protection to the buildings, they could still be renovated or demolished with the LPC&#x27;s approval. As early as 1973, the Gay Activists Alliance had advocated for the exterior of the bar to be designated as an individual city landmark. Seventh-day Adventist Kinship International, a support group for LGBT members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, indicated in 1985 that it would seek to have the buildings added to the NRHP as individual landmarks.

==== National and city designations ====

In early 1999, thirty years after the riots, the GVSHP and the Organization of Lesbian and Gay Architects and Designers jointly nominated the bar for inclusion on the NRHP. The historian Andrew Dolkart, who prepared the NRHP nomination, included Christopher Park and the surrounding streets in the nomination because of their role in the riots; the officers who had raided the bar were unfamiliar with Greenwich Village&#x27;s irregular street grid, so they simply chased the crowd down these streets. The Stonewall Inn and surrounding area was formally listed on the NRHP on June 25, 1999. The NRHP designation still did not fully protect the buildings from demolition, but the designation was nonetheless unusual, as sites were generally not added to the NRHP until at least 50 years after their period of historical significance had elapsed. The area was designated a National Historic Landmark in March 2000, a label that, at the time, was given to just three percent of all NRHP sites. David Carter compared the NRHP–designated streets to an &quot;important battlefield&quot; in 2002, saying that &quot;you don&#x27;t want to alter any part of it&quot;.

The GVSHP began advocating for Stonewall to be designated as an individual city landmark in January 2014, following the demolition of a showroom on Park Avenue, as the group wanted the buildings&#x27; appearance to be preserved. The LPC agreed to consider designating the bar in May 2015; the Real Estate Board of New York was among the supporters of the designation. The LPC voted on June 23, 2015, to protect Stonewall as a city landmark, which was confirmed by the New York City Council later that year. Stonewall was, at the time, one of 50 city landmarks selected specifically for its symbolism, out of the city&#x27;s 33,000 landmarked structures. The designation preserved the buildings&#x27; appearance but did not mandate that they continue to be used as a bar.

Efforts to designate the Stonewall Inn as a U.S. national monument began in the 2010s, and three U.S. Congress members from New York formally proposed designating the buildings as a national monument in late 2015. Politicians and activists supported the monument designation, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation to allow the National Park Service to take over the nearby Christopher Park, though the bar buildings remained privately owned. On June 24, 2016, Cuomo named the Stonewall Inn as a State Historic Site, and U.S. President Barack Obama established a 7.7-acre (3.11 ha) area around the bar as the Stonewall National Monument. Stacy Lentz supported both the city landmark and the national monument designations, calling them important for LGBT history.

Stonewall was both the first LGBT cultural site ever added to the NRHP and the first official New York City landmark to be designated specifically based on its LGBT cultural significance. In addition, the Stonewall National Monument was the first U.S. national monument designated around an LGBT historic site. Following Stonewall&#x27;s designation as a city landmark, the LPC sought to designate other LGBT cultural sites, such as the Audre Lorde Residence and the LGBT Community Center. Other LGBT–related sites were added to the NRHP following Stonewall&#x27;s designation, including Julius Bar, James Baldwin Residence, and Caffe Cino in New York City. , it was one of 28 NRHP sites nationwide that had been designated specifically because of their LGBT history, out of over 90,000 total NRHP listings.

=== Namesakes and media ===
The Stonewall Inn and the subsequent riots inspired the creation of various LGBT–themed works of art, such as music, literature, and visual and performing arts. St. Martin&#x27;s Press launched a label for LGBT books, Stonewall Inn Editions, in 1987; the label was discontinued in 2002. Other things have been named for the bar and riots, including an LGBT retirement home in Massachusetts, an LGBT-rights organization in Salt Lake City, the British LGBT-rights group Stonewall, and a multi-city sports league. Thomas Garguilo, the bar&#x27;s onetime operator, also created a Facebook page and a website about the bar&#x27;s history.

No newsreel or TV footage was taken of the riots, and contemporary news articles did not describe the riot in detail, nor was it reported widely. Some reporters, such as Fred W. McDarrah of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and Joseph Ambrosini of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, took a limited number of pictures of the riots and the bar itself. Additional images of the bar during the riots&#x27; final day were published in 2009. The few home movies and photographs that do exist have been used in documentaries.

The bar itself was described in various works of print media, often in association with the riots. For example, Edmund White&#x27;s 1988 semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Beautiful Room is Empty&quot; includes a first-hand account of him unintentionally encountering the Stonewall riots. Martin Duberman&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Stonewall&quot; describes the bar and the events leading up to the riots, and David Carter published a book about the bar&#x27;s history, &quot;Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution&quot;, in 2004 for the 35th anniversary of the riots. The bar was the subject of Garguilo&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Stonewall Revival: Tales Of 53 Christopher Street.&quot; and it was described in WNET&#x27;s 2001 television special &quot;A Walk in Greenwich Village&quot;. The riots were depicted in movies and theater as well, such as the 1995 comedy film &quot;Stonewall&quot;, the 2010 documentary &quot;Stonewall&quot; (which was based on Carter&#x27;s book), the 2012 play &quot;Hit the Wall&quot;, and the 2015 drama film &quot;Stonewall&quot;.

<doc id="633730" wikidata="Q721950" url="?curid=633730" title="Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)">
<text>Somewhere in Time is the sixth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was released on 29 September 1986 in the United Kingdom by EMI Records and in the United States by Capitol Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature guitar synthesisers.

Since its release, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; has been certified platinum by the RIAA, having sold over one million copies in the US. Somewhere on Tour was the album&#x27;s supporting tour. In 2023, it was made the focus of the Future Past World Tour, alongside 2021&#x27;s &quot;Senjutsu&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; is the band&#x27;s first studio effort following the extensive World Slavery Tour of 1984–85, which was physically draining for the group, lasting 331 days and comprising 187 concerts. The resulting exhaustion is credited as the main factor in the complete lack of songwriting contributions from lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band. Dickinson had written several &quot;acoustic-based&quot; songs, explaining that &quot;I felt we had to come up with our &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; or &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; ... we had to get it onto another level or we&#x27;d stagnate and drift away&quot;, although bassist and primary writer Steve Harris &quot;thought he&#x27;d lost the plot completely&quot;, surmising that &quot;he was probably more burnt out than anyone at the end of that last tour&quot;. On the other hand, the record is also notable for the number of &quot;fully formed&quot; songs written by guitarist Adrian Smith, who wrote both of the album&#x27;s singles: &quot;Wasted Years&quot; and &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, the former of which is the only song on the record not to feature synthesisers.

Following the World Slavery Tour, the group were given four months to recuperate, with Harris, Smith and guitarist Dave Murray spending the time experimenting with new equipment. The result was a marked change in sound for Iron Maiden, as it was their first to use guitar synthesisers, although on their next release, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, the effects were provided by keyboards instead. Given their time off, this was their first studio album not to be released a year after their previous one, the band insisting that they have more time &quot;to get it right without hurrying for a change&quot;, comments Harris. It was also one of their most expensive records, with the bass and drums recorded in the Bahamas, the guitars and vocals recorded in The Netherlands and the mixing taking place in New York.

While the majority of the release&#x27;s songs have disappeared from the band&#x27;s live shows shortly after its supporting tour, &quot;Wasted Years&quot; and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; have appeared on several subsequent tours. On 28 May 2023, nearly 37 years after the album&#x27;s release, Iron Maiden performed &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; live for the first time.

The 2008 tribute CD &quot;Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;, released by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, features covers of two of the album&#x27;s songs; &quot;Wasted Years&quot; by DevilDriver and &quot;Caught Somewhere in Time&quot; by Madina Lake.

== Songs ==
Although &quot;space and time&quot; are common themes throughout the release, with songs such as &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, &quot;Caught Somewhere in Time&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;Deja-Vu&quot;, the band never intended for it to be a concept album, with Harris stating, &quot;We certainly never went in there and said, &#x27;Right let&#x27;s write a load of songs on the subject of time.

The album opener and demi-title track &quot;Caught Somewhere in Time&quot;, written by Harris, is narrated from the point of view of the Devil (or a demon) offering a man a time travel, in exchange for his soul. Adrian Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, the album&#x27;s leading single, deals with the themes of homesickness and alienation and was partially inspired by Smith&#x27;s own experiences during the seemingly-unending World Slavery Tour, and is followed by &quot;Sea of Madness&quot;, an up-tempo by the same author; speaking of those, Harris highlighted their &quot;optimistic message&quot;. &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; was one of the first songs completed during the writing process, and Harris stated that it is about a person having an out-of-body experience and fighting it with their determination to live.

&quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; was based on the 1962 British film of the same name and tells the story of a boy reflecting on long-distance running as a way to evade both physically and emotionally from his situation; in 2017, the song was quoted by Paula Radcliffe (2005 World Champion in the discipline) in a clip about the mental and physical faculties a long-distance runner needs, in the context of the BBC coverage of the 2017 World Championships in Athletics. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, was inspired to Smith by the true story of a sailor disappeared during an expedition to the North Pole and found years later perfectly preserved in ice, and draws its title from a 1959 Robert Heinlein book. &quot;Dejà Vu&quot;, the only co-written song in the tracklist, is about the psychological sensation of déjà vu, whereby someone feels a strong sense of recolletion despite the context makes it uncertain or impossible. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Alexander the Great (356–323 BC)&quot;, is a chronological narration of the life and conquers of Alexander the Great, the King of Macedon from 336 to 323 BC and conqueror of a great portion of Eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor.

==Cover artwork==
The cover for &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, created by the band&#x27;s then-regular artist Derek Riggs, displays a muscular cyborg-enhanced Eddie in a futuristic, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;-inspired environment. Much like the cover of &quot;Powerslave&quot;, the wraparound album cover holds a plethora of references to earlier Iron Maiden albums and songs, such as:

*The street sign on the corner where Eddie is standing reads Acacia (partially obscured), a reference to the song &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot; from &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (1982).
*Below &quot;Acacia&quot; is a poster of Eddie from the first album, with graffiti reading &quot;Eddie lives&quot; written on it. Torn posters are also featured on the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Women in Uniform&quot; singles.
*A banner with the words &quot;This is a very boring painting&quot; is displayed backward within the lobby of the Bradbury Towers Hotels International. This can be seen to the left of Eddie&#x27;s right leg.
*In the very centre, just above the &quot;Department&quot; sign and behind the cable going to the cyborg&#x27;s weapon, there is a small vertical phrase in red neon, which reads &quot;Меня Рвёт&quot; [Menya Rvyot], Russian for &quot;I&#x27;m vomiting&quot; — or more literally, &quot;it&#x27;s tearing me up&quot;, depending on the context.
*An Eye of Horus neon sign is at the top of a building, a reference to the song &quot;Powerslave&quot; from the 1984 album of the same name.
*To the right of Eddie&#x27;s left leg there is a rubbish bin attached to a lamppost, identical to the one seen on the cover of the &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; album.
*The haloed black cat from the back cover of &quot;Live After Death&quot; (1985) is on the pavement behind Eddie.
*Below the Eye of Horus is the name, &quot;Websters&quot;, a tribute to Charlie Webster, EMI&#x27;s art director.
*Derek Riggs&#x27; artistic signature symbol can be found on Eddie&#x27;s chest.

References on the back include:
*A clock reading 23:58 (&quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;).
*Below the clock there is a sign which reads &quot;Phantom Opera House&quot;, in reference to the song &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; from the first album.
*The words &quot;Bollocks again &amp; again&quot; appear just below the &quot;Phantom Opera House&quot;.
*A building on the left side carries the sign, &quot;Aces High Bar&quot;, a reference to the song of the same name.
*Flying over the &quot;Aces High Bar&quot; is a Spitfire from the &quot;Aces High&quot; cover.
*To the left of the &quot;Aces High Bar&quot; are four letters in yellow and green. These are Hebrew letters spelling out the name of God, namely יהוה, Jehovah/Yahweh.
*Below the &quot;Aces High Bar&quot;, is a sign that reads &quot;Sand Dune&quot; in reference to their song &quot;To Tame a Land,&quot; from &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; (1983), based on the novel &quot;Dune&quot;.
*Many pyramids appear in the background, a reference to the &quot;Powerslave&quot; album.
*Among the pyramids is a grim reaper similar to that which appears on the covers of &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Live After Death&quot;.
*The marquee for the cinema reads &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, the film which inspired the album&#x27;s cover. It also reads &quot;Live After Death&quot;, the name of their 1985 live album.
*The cinema is named &quot;Philip K. Dick Cinema&quot;, named after the author of &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, the book on which the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was based.
*More &quot;Blade Runner&quot; references include &quot;Dekkers Department Stores&quot; and a &quot;Tyrell Corp&quot; sign.
*In the background, &quot;Bradbury Towers&quot; can be seen, a reference to the Bradbury Building which is prominent in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.
*To the right of the clock is a neon sign which reads &quot;Ancient Mariner Seafood Restaurant&quot;, a reference to the song &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; from the &quot;Powerslave&quot; album.
*On the bottom left hand side of the cover is &quot;The Ruskin Arms&quot;, famous for being one of the first venues in which Iron Maiden performed.
*On the second floor of the &quot;Ruskin Arms&quot; building is a woman sitting in a red lit room which, a reference to Charlotte the Harlot, a repeated character in the band&#x27;s songs.
*Just above &quot;The Ruskin Arms&quot; is a neon sign that reads &quot;Rainbow&quot;, another famous venue where Iron Maiden recorded a video in 1980.
*Above and to the left of the &quot;Rainbow&quot; sign is a neon sign reading &quot;L&#x27;Amours Beer Gardens&quot;, a reference to the &quot;L&#x27;Amours&quot; rock venue which Iron Maiden once played in Brooklyn, New York.
*On the roof of the same building is the TARDIS from the BBC TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The TARDIS is also featured on the cover of the &quot;Wasted Years&quot; single.
*Above the Bradbury Towers neon sign is Icarus in flames falling from the sky, in the same style of the cover for the band&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot;. According to Riggs, Icarus is supposed to look like the logo used by Swan Song Records, a label founded by Led Zeppelin.
*On the walkway above the clock is an electronic sign that says &quot;LATEST RESULTS...WEST HAM 7...ARSENAL 3&quot;, a nod to Steve Harris who is a West Ham United supporter.
*At the right edge below, just near the band, there is another sign in Russian – Кефир (&quot;Kefir&quot;).
*Just above the &quot;KEFIR&quot; sign is a street sign reading &quot;Upton Park,&quot; which was the name of West Ham&#x27;s former stadium.
*There is a sign which reads &quot;Tonight: Gypsy&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, a reference to Harris&#x27; first band.
*On the right side, above the &quot;Bradbury Towers&quot; sign, is a sign in Japanese, &quot;浅田　彰,&quot; which refers to a notable Japanese philosopher, economist and critic, Akira Asada.
*To the right of the pyramids is a sign reading &quot;Long Beach Arena,&quot; which is where most of the &quot;Live After Death&quot; live album was recorded.
*The Syncom sign refers to the 1961 NASA program of the same name.
*The neon sign above the band reads &quot;Maggies Revenge&quot; and refers to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who appears on the cover of the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Women in Uniform&quot; singles.
*One of the buildings is labelled &quot;Asimov Foundation&quot;, a reference to the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov.
*A character wearing a large cloak stands above the walkway&#x27;s right side, which Riggs claims is Batman.
*Above and slightly to the right of the cloaked character reads more Hebrew lettering, &quot;ג&#x27;ין&quot; (Gin, in English).
*On the right side of the walkway and just above the &quot;Latest Results&quot; sign is the bracket that holds Eddie&#x27;s skull together from the &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; album onwards, which Riggs drew as a cartouche.
*In the bottom right hand corner all five members of the band are standing in a line. Dickinson is holding a brain, a reference to &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, and drummer Nicko McBrain is wearing aviator goggles (he had a pilot&#x27;s license by this time, long before Dickinson) and a T-shirt that says &quot;Iron What?&quot;. According to Riggs, the band complained because the pictures of themselves were not accurate enough.
*To the right of &quot;Long Beach Arena&quot; is a sign which reads &quot;Hammerjacks&quot;, a night club and concert hall in Baltimore frequented by the band.
*Below Hammerjacks is a sign that reads &quot;Tehe&#x27;s Bar&quot;, which is where the choir vocals in the middle of &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; were recorded.
*To the left of the clock is a sign that reads &quot;Herbert Ails&quot;, a reference to the author Frank Herbert who wrote the book, &quot;Dune,&quot; upon which the Iron Maiden song, &quot;To Tame a Land&quot;, is based. Herbert had also died that same year, explaining the word &quot;Ails&quot;. The reference also refers to the unfriendly response the band received from Herbert (via his agent) regarding permission to use &quot;Dune&quot; as the song&#x27;s title.
*Beneath the Phantom Opera House sign, there is a sign that reads &quot;EMI REC.&quot;. All of the band&#x27;s albums, outside North America, have been released by EMI Records.
Riggs came up with all the in-jokes and references and it took him 3 months to complete the 15x32 inch painting. The process wore him out completely as he underestimated the complexity of the artwork and said he would never paint anything this convoluted ever again.

<text>Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti (28 February 1783 – 24 April 1854) was an Italian nobleman, poet, constitutionalist, scholar, and founder of the secret society Carbonari.

Rossetti was born in Vasto in the Kingdom of Naples. He was a Roman Catholic. His support for Italian revolutionary nationalism forced him into political exile in England in 1821.

==Early career and exile==
Rossetti&#x27;s first edition of poems was printed in 1807 by Giovanni Avalloni, who offered to have Rossetti&#x27;s poems published after hearing him recite a few passages. Throughout his early career, Rossetti published poems that were &quot;patriotic&quot; and supported the &quot;popular movement&quot; in Sicily which resulted in him receiving a grant from Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies in 1820. When the king revoked the constitution in 1821, many supporters of the constitution were persecuted, but Rossetti instead was forced into exile in Malta for three years before a British admiral of the Royal Navy sent Rossetti to London in 1824. He held the post of Professor of Italian at King&#x27;s College London from 1831, as well as teaching Italian at King&#x27;s College School, until failing eyesight led to his retirement in 1847.
==Works==
Rossetti&#x27;s published works include literary criticism, Romantic poetry such as his long poem &quot;Il veggente in solitudine&quot; of 1846, and his &quot;Autobiography&quot;. He is thought to be the basis of the character Pesca in Wilkie Collins&#x27; 1860 novel &quot;The Woman in White&quot;. He also wrote commentaries on Dante Alighieri in which he attempted to show evidence of mysterious ancient conspiracies in his works.

==Personal life==
In 1826 he married Frances Mary Lavinia Polidori, daughter of another Italian exile Gaetano Polidori, and they had four children, all distinguished writers or artists: 

* Maria Francesca Rossetti
* Dante Gabriel Rossetti
* William Michael Rossetti
* Christina Georgina Rossetti

Rossetti died on 24 April 1854 in London, aged 71, and is buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery, adjacent to the grave of Elizabeth Madox Brown, the first wife of Ford Madox Brown. Later burials in the Rossetti family grave are Elizabeth Siddal, wife of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1862), Frances Rossetti, wife of Gabriele (1886), Christina Georgina Rossetti (1895) and William Michael Rossetti (1919). The ashes of four grandchildren have also been buried in the grave.

<doc id="633739" wikidata="Q794367" url="?curid=633739" title="Beyond Good &amp; Evil (video game)">
<text>Beyond Good &amp; Evil is a 2003 action-adventure game developed and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox, and GameCube. The story follows the adventures of Jade, an investigative reporter, martial artist, and spy hitwoman working with a resistance movement to reveal a sinister alien conspiracy. Players control Jade and other allies, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, obtaining photographic evidence and, later in the game, travelling to space.

Michel Ancel, creator of the &quot;Rayman&quot; series, envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy. The game was developed under the codename &quot;Project BG&amp;E&quot; by 30 employees of Ubisoft&#x27;s studio divisions in Montpellier and Milan, with production lasting more than three years. One of the main goals of the game is to create a meaningful story while giving players much freedom, though the game adopts a relatively linear structure. The game was received poorly when it was shown at E3 2002, and it prompted the developers to change some of the game&#x27;s elements, including Jade&#x27;s design. Ancel also attempted to streamline the game in order to make it more commercially appealing.

&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; received generally favorable reviews upon release, with critics praising the game&#x27;s animation, setting, story and design, but criticizing its combat and technical issues. The game received a nomination for &quot;Game of the Year&quot; at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. While the game was considered a commercial failure at launch, it has since developed a cult following and is even considered by some to be one of the greatest video games ever made.

A full HD remastered version of the game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011. A prequel, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil 2&quot;, is in development and was announced at E3 2017. A hybrid live-action/animated film adaptation is currently in the works at Netflix. Another remaster, titled the &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, was released on June 25, 2024.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; is an action-adventure game with elements of puzzle-solving and stealth-based games. The player controls the protagonist, Jade, from a third-person perspective. Jade can run, move stealthily, jump over obstacles and pits, climb ladders, push or bash doors and objects, and flatten herself against walls. As Jade, the player investigates a number of installations in search of the truth about a war with an alien threat.

In the game&#x27;s interior spaces, the player solves puzzles and makes their way past enemies in order to reach areas containing photographic evidence. Jade&#x27;s main tools are her Daï-jo combat staff (a melee weapon), discs for attacking at range, and a camera. Jade&#x27;s health, represented by hearts, decreases when hit by enemy attacks. It can be restored using fictional food items and can be increased beyond the maximum with &quot;PA-1s&quot; that, when held by Jade or her companions, increases their life gauge by one heart. If Jade&#x27;s health is depleted, the game will restart at the last checkpoint. Certain stealth segments later in the game can automatically kill Jade if she is detected. Most stealth elements allow Jade to fight for her life if she is detected, but it&#x27;s more difficult to survive this way.

At times, it is only possible to advance in the game with the help of other characters. These characters are computer-controlled, and players direct them via contextual commands. For example, the player can order them to perform a &quot;super attack&quot;, either pounding the ground to bounce enemies into the air, allowing the player to hit them from long distances, or knocking them off balance, making them vulnerable to attack. These allies possess a health bar and are incapacitated if it is depleted. Jade can share some of her items, such as PA-1s, with these characters.

In addition to obtaining evidence and completing assignments, Jade&#x27;s camera can take pictures of animal species in exchange for currency, and scan objects to reveal more information about the environment. When the &quot;Gyrodisk Glove&quot; is obtained, Jade can attack enemies or activate devices from a distance by using the camera interface. There are also various minigames and sub-missions offered by NPCs scattered throughout the world.

A hovercraft is used to travel around the world, and also used for racing and in other minigames. Later, the spaceship &quot;Beluga&quot; is acquired. The hovercraft can dock with the spaceship. Both vehicles require upgrades in order to reach new areas and progress through the game. Upgrades are purchased using pearls that are collected throughout the game, by completing missions, exploring areas, filling in the animal directory or by trading credits for them. The vehicles have a boost ability, and can be repaired using a &quot;Repair Pod&quot; if damaged by enemies.

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===
&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; takes place in the year 2435 on the mining planet of Hillys, located in a remote section of the galaxy. The architecture of the city around which the game takes place is rustic European in style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as email and credit cards, with those of science fiction and fantasy, such as spacecraft and anthropomorphic animals coexisting with people. As the game begins, Hillys is under siege by aliens called the &quot;DomZ&quot;, who abduct beings and either drain their life force for power or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves. Prior to the opening of the game, a military dictatorship called the &quot;Alpha Sections&quot; has come to power on Hillys, promising to defend the populace. However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite its public assurances. An underground resistance movement, the IRIS Network, fights the Alpha Sections, believing it to be in league with the DomZ.

&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot;″s main protagonist, Jade (voiced by Jodi Forrest), is a young photojournalist. Uncle Pey&#x27;j (voiced by David Gasman), a boar-like creature, is Jade&#x27;s best friend, with whom Jade resides in an island lighthouse that doubles as a home for children orphaned by DomZ attacks, whom they care for. Double H, a heavily built human IRIS operative, assists Jade during missions. He wears a military-issue suit of armor at all times. Secundo, an artificial intelligence built into Jade&#x27;s storage unit, the &quot;Synthetic-Atomic-Compressor&quot; (SAC), offers advice and &quot;digitizes&quot; items. The main antagonists are the DomZ High Priest, who is the chief architect of the invasion, and Alpha Sections leader General Kehck, who uses propaganda to gain the Hillyans&#x27; trust, even as he abducts citizens to sustain the DomZ.

===Story===
Jade and Pey&#x27;j are taking care of the children of Hillys orphaned by the DomZ. When meditating with one of the orphans outside, a DomZ siren sounds. Jade rushes to turn the power on for the shield, but discovers that it has been deactivated due to a lack of funds. The lighthouse is left vulnerable to the meteor shower, and several DomZ creatures manage to abduct a number of the orphans. Jade is forced to fight these creatures to free the children. With Pey&#x27;j&#x27;s help, she then defeats a DomZ monster that emerges from a meteor crater. The Alpha Sections arrive just after Jade defeats the monster, leaving Pey&#x27;j to grumble that they were late as usual.

Secundo finds a photography job for Jade, so she can pay to turn the power back on for the shield. The job involves cataloging all the species on Hillys for a science museum. Jade is then contacted by a &quot;man in black&quot; to investigate and take pictures of a creature presumed to be DomZ twins in an abandoned mine on a nearby island. The DomZ twins turns out to be the antennae of a huge DomZ monster. Once defeated, the &quot;man in black&quot; takes off his suit and a taxi car flies out of the limousine he was driving. The man reveals he actually works for the IRIS Network, and that the job was a test of Jade&#x27;s skills.

Jade is then recruited as an agent of the network, which suspects that the Alpha Sections are behind planet-wide disappearances. Jade&#x27;s first target of investigation is an Alpha Sections-run ration factory. She discovers evidence of human trafficking orchestrated by the DomZ under the Alpha Sections&#x27; authority. Along the way she rescues Double H, who was kidnapped and tortured by the DomZ. Pey&#x27;j is then abducted by the DomZ and taken to an abandoned slaughterhouse where he and the other kidnapped victims are to be transported to a base on Hillys&#x27; moon, Selene. After failing to extract Pey&#x27;j from the slaughterhouse in time, Jade learns that he was, in fact, the secret chief of the IRIS Network.

Jade learns that the Alpha Sections are being possessed and manipulated by the DomZ. Using &quot;Beluga&quot;, the ship Pey&#x27;j used to travel to Hillys, Jade and Double H go to the DomZ lunar base. There, Jade finds Pey&#x27;j dead after weeks of torture, but a strange power inside her brings back his soul, reviving him. After rescuing Pey&#x27;j, destroying Kehck&#x27;s command ship, transmitting her final report, and sparking a revolution against the Alpha Sections, Jade confronts the DomZ High Priest. She learns that her human form is the latest container to hide a power stolen from the DomZ centuries ago in the hope that the High Priest, who must have spirit energy to survive, would starve to death. The High Priest managed to find a substitute energy in the souls of all those kidnapped from Hillys, and captures Pey&#x27;j and Double H to force Jade to submit to him. Using the stolen power within her, Jade is able to destroy the High Priest, though nearly losing control of her soul in the process, and then revives and rescues those that have been abducted. In a post-credits scene back on Hillys, a DomZ spore grows on Pey&#x27;j&#x27;s hand as the screen fades to black.

==Development==

&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; was developed by Michel Ancel, the creator of the &quot;Rayman&quot; video game, at Ubisoft&#x27;s Pictures studio in Montpellier. The game was developed under the codename &quot;Project BG&amp;E&quot;, with production lasting more than three years. A group of 30 employees composed the development team. Ubisoft&#x27;s chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, fully supported the project and frequently met with the team. After years working on &quot;Rayman&quot;, Ancel wanted to move on to something different. He recalled that the goal of &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; was to &quot;pack a whole universe onto a single CD—mountains, planets, towns. The idea was to make the player feel like an explorer, with a sense of absolute freedom.&quot;

A second goal behind &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot;″s design was to create a meaningful story amid player freedom. Ancel said that the linear nature of the gameplay was necessary to convey the story; player freedom was an experience between parts of the plot. He also strove to create a rhythm similar to a movie to engage and delight players. The game drew on many influences and inspirations, including the Miyazaki universe, politics and the media, and the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In creating the lead character, Ancel&#x27;s wife reportedly inspired the designer, who wanted to portray a persona with whom players could identify.

&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; was first shown publicly at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it received a negative reception. Originally more &quot;artistically ambitious&quot; and resembling games like &quot;Ico&quot;, the game was substantially changed in order to make it more commercially appealing. Jade, originally a teenage girl, was redesigned to be more powerful and befitting of her job. The game was also shortened by removing long periods of exploration, due to Ancel&#x27;s dislike of this aspect of gameplay in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot;. The development team was &quot;demoralized&quot; by the changes, with Ancel commenting that the finished game resembled a sequel more than a reworking. Prior to release, playable previews of the game were offered in movie theaters.

===Audio===
The soundtrack of &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; was composed by Christophe Héral, who was hired by Ancel because of his background in film. Hubert Chevillard, a director with whom Ancel had worked in the past, had also worked with Héral on a television special, &quot;The Pantin Pirouette&quot;, and referred him to Ancel. Héral was assisted by Laetitia Pansanel, who orchestrated the pieces, and his brother Patrice Héral, who performed some of the sound effects and singing.

The soundtrack incorporates a wide variety of languages and instruments from around the world. Mainly Bulgarian lyrics were chosen for the song &quot;Propaganda&quot;, which plays in the game&#x27;s Akuda Bar, to allude to the Soviet propaganda of the Cold War. It uses a recording of a telephone conversation by Héral with a female Bulgarian friend to represent the government&#x27;s control of the media. It also incorporates Arabic string instruments and Indian percussion. A song called &quot;Funky Mullah&quot; was originally planned for the Akuda Bar, but it was replaced by &quot;Propaganda&quot; because Héral decided that its muezzin vocals, recorded on September 8, 2001, would have been in bad taste in the wake of the September 11 attacks. &quot;Fun and Mini-games&quot;, a song that plays during hovercraft races and other minigames, includes Spanish lyrics. The lyrics for DomZ music were created from a fictional language with prominent rolling &quot;r&quot; sounds. The crashing metal sound effects of &quot;Metal Gear DomZ&quot;, the music played during a boss fight, were recorded from the son of Héral&#x27;s neighbor playing with scrap metal. The voices in the city of Hillys were also recorded by Héral himself. The music had not been initially published as an album and instead had been released in its entirety as a free download by Ubisoft. However, on June 26th, 2024, Ubisoft announced the release of the entire soundtrack on double vinyl through Wayô Records to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the game and the 2024 remaster. The soundtrack is featured in the Video Games Live international concert tour.

== Release ==
&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; was first released for PlayStation 2 in North America on November 11, 2003, with versions for Microsoft Windows and Xbox following on December 2 of that same year. The GameCube version, which was initially scheduled to ship alongside the latter platforms, was delayed until December 10. The game was released in Europe for PlayStation 2 and Windows on November 14 and December 5, respectively. The GameCube and Xbox versions were released the following year on February 27, 2004.

===Remasters===
A full HD remastered version of the game was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai, released on Xbox Live Arcade on March 2, 2011, and on PlayStation Network in Europe on June 8, 2011, and in North America on June 28. It features improved character models and textures, as well as a modified soundtrack. Achievements, trophies and online leaderboards were also added. The HD edition was made backwards compatible on the Xbox One and available free to Gold members from August 16, 2016, through September 1, 2016, as part of the Games with Gold program. Ubisoft released &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil HD&quot; for retail in Europe on September 21, 2012. The retail package includes &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil HD&quot;, &quot;Outland&quot; and &quot;From Dust&quot;.

An early version of another remaster, the &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, was accidentally released to some Ubisoft+ subscribers on Xbox platforms by Ubisoft on November 29, 2023. It was quickly removed from availability. The official release date was set for early 2024, although it did not end up releasing at that timeframe. The remaster&#x27;s existence was leaked in August 2023. It was officially unveiled on June 20, 2024, and released five days later. In addition to updated graphics and remastered audio, &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot; adds new features, including a speedrun mode; an anniversary gallery containing original development art, screenshots, and footage; unlockable cosmetic items for the main characters, weapons, and vehicles; and a new sidequest that connects to the story of &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2&quot;.

==Reception==
Prior to its release, &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; and &quot;&quot; praised &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; at E3 2003 and described it as one of the best titles on display.

&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.

The game&#x27;s graphics were generally well received. In reviewing the GameCube version, &quot;Game Informer&quot; wrote that &quot;Every moment of &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; looks as good as a traditional RPG cutscene&quot; and that the game&#x27;s effects and character animations were &quot;amazing&quot;. On the other hand, Jon Hicks of &quot;PC Format&quot; wrote that while some effects were excellent, the game&#x27;s otherwise unspectacular graphics were unwelcome reminders of the game&#x27;s console roots. 1UP.com and &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; cited glitches such as frame rate as irksome, because the game did not appear to tax the console&#x27;s hardware.

&quot;Edge&quot; commended the game for its storytelling and design, but criticized its plot as unable to &quot;match Jade&#x27;s initial appeal,&quot; becoming &quot;fairly mundane&quot; without &quot;the darkness and moral ambiguity suggested by the title&quot;, with Jade&#x27;s everyman appeal undermined by the revelation of her &quot;mysterious hidden identity&quot;. Dan Toose of &quot;SMH&quot; called the game&#x27;s setting &quot;dark, baroque and earthy, a far cry from the squeaky-clean action of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games,&quot; and described the game as &quot;a very European take on the role-playing genre&quot; and &quot;one of the best adventure games in years&quot;. Star Dingo of &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that the game was a &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; that &quot;never really lives up to its title&quot;, adding that its vision could have been more focused. Among complaints were control issues and a lack of gameplay depth. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Lisa Mason wrote that the game&#x27;s controls were serviceable, but simplistic, and that she wished she could do more with the character. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Kevin Rice found most of the gameplay and its exploration refreshing, but called hovercraft races &quot;not much fun&quot; and felt combat was the game&#x27;s weakest element. &quot;Edge&quot; called the gameplay interaction &quot;hollowed out&quot;, as an unintended consequence of Ancel&#x27;s attempt to streamline the game.

=== Sales ===
&quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; was not a commercial success. The game saw poor sales upon its release in the 2003 Christmas and holiday season. Retailers quickly decreased the price by up to 80 percent. &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; staff attributed the poor sales of the game—among many other 2003 releases—to an over-saturated market, and labeled &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; as a commercial &quot;disappointment&quot;. In retrospect, Ancel noted that consumers at the time were interested in established franchises and technologically impressive games. Coupled with the number of &quot;big titles&quot; available, he stated that the market was a poor environment for &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; and that it would take time to be appreciated. The &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; staff further commented that the lack of marketing from Ubisoft and the game&#x27;s odd premise naturally reserved it to obscurity. Part of the disappointing sales stemmed from Ubisoft not knowing how to market the title, something that Ubisoft North America CEO Laurent Detoc labeled as one of his worst business decisions. At the time, Ubisoft&#x27;s marketing efforts were more focused on the release of &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;. Ubisoft&#x27;s former North American vice-president of publishing, Jay Cohen, and its European managing director, Alaine Corre, attributed the commercial failure of the game to a lack of marketing. &quot;The game play was there, the technical excellence was there but perhaps the target audience was not there,&quot; Corre told the BBC. Corre later commented that the Xbox 360 release (in 2011) &quot;did extremely well&quot;, but considered this success &quot;too late&quot; to make a difference in the game&#x27;s poor sales. The game was intended to be the first part of a trilogy, but its poor sales placed those plans on hold at the time.

===Sequel or prequel===
Ancel stated his desire to produce a sequel to the game. Ubisoft announced at the Ubidays 2008 opening conference that there would be a second game. A sequel, tentatively titled &quot;Beyond Good and Evil 2&quot;, is currently in development, although the project was temporarily halted to focus on &quot;Rayman Origins&quot;. Michel Ancel has hinted that Jade would have a new look for the game. In early 2016, Destructoid published a rumor that the game was being funded by Nintendo as an exclusive to their upcoming console codenamed &quot;NX&quot; (later officially unveiled as the Nintendo Switch). On September 27, 2016, Michel Ancel posted an image to Instagram with the caption &quot;Somewhere in system 4 ... - Thanks #ubisoft for making this possible !&quot;. On October 4, Ancel stated that &quot;Beyond Good and Evil 2&quot; was in pre-production. Ubisoft confirmed Ancel&#x27;s claim on October 6, 2016. Ubisoft showed the first new trailer for &quot;Beyond Good and Evil 2&quot; during their E3 2017 conference and was announced as a prequel to the first game. During E3 2017, Ancel confirmed that the 2008 and 2009 trailers were from initial work as a narrative sequel to &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot;, but during development they opted to change direction and make it a prequel, and thus the work previously shown was from an effectively different game. There had been rumors that it would have been released as a timed exclusive for the Nintendo Switch in the prior year, but Ancel confirmed this was not the case. The &quot;Space Monkey Program&quot; lists the game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, however Michel Ancel stated that the platforms have not been announced yet, and that the listing was due to a bug. Ancel later told &quot;Kotaku&quot; that the game is designed to run on many platforms.

When Ancel announced his departure from Ubisoft in September 2020, he stated that both the project and &quot;Wild&quot; were in capable hands. The French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;, which have been following on Ubisoft&#x27;s troubles with mid-2020 series of sexual misconduct allegations raised against many high-level members of the company, learned that members of Ancel&#x27;s team found Ancel&#x27;s leadership on the project to be unorganized and at times abusive, causing the game&#x27;s development to have many restarts and accounting for the delay since its 2010 announcement. The Montpellier team had reported these concerns to leadership of Ubisoft as early as 2017 but Ancel&#x27;s close relationship with Yves Guillemot prevented any major corrections to occur until the 2020 internal evaluations that led to Ancel&#x27;s departure. Ubisoft stated that Ancel &quot;hasn&#x27;t been directly involved in &quot;BG&amp;E2&quot; for some time now&quot; when he left the company. In July 2021, Ubisoft stated in a financial report that development was &quot;progressing well&quot; but did not answer a question about its release date. On February 9, 2022, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that the sequel &quot;remains in pre-production after at least five years of development&quot;. In 2022, the prequel broke the record held by &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; (2011) for the longest development for a video game, at more than 15 years.

===Other media===
In late July 2020, streaming service company Netflix announced a live-action animated film adaptation based on the video game is in development with &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot; director Rob Letterman. No further updates have been given for the film since the announcement.

Jade and Pey&#x27;j appear as characters in the 2023 Netflix animated series &quot;Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix&quot;, voiced by Courtney Mae-Briggs and Glenn Wrage respectively. In the series, they are depicted as captive rebels and love interests who are recruited into a team led by the eponymous character.

<text>Richard Anthony Salisbury (born Richard Anthony Markham; 2 May 1761 – 23 March 1829) was a British botanist. While he carried out valuable work in horticultural and botanical sciences, several bitter disputes caused him to be ostracised by his contemporaries.

== Life ==

Richard Anthony Markham was born in Leeds, England, as the only son of Richard Markham, a cloth merchant and Elizabeth Laycock. His family included two sisters, including his older sister Mary (b. 1755). One of his sisters became a nun. His mother, was the great grand-daughter of Jonathan Laycock of Shaw Hill. Laycock in turn married Mary Lyte (b. 1537), brother of Henry Lyte, the botanist and translator of the herbal of Dodoens. Of this, he wrote &quot;so I inherit a taste for botany from very ancient blood&quot;. He studied at a school near Halifax and by the age of eight had established a passion for plants.

He attended medical school at the University of Edinburgh in 1780, where he would have at least been aware of the influence of John Hope, then Professor of Medicine and Botany. At Edinburgh he became friendly with James Edward Smith, another student, who would found and become president of the Linnean Society. Smith gathered a circle of friends together to form the Society for the Investigation of Natural History in March 1782. Smith described Markham as &#x27;a young man of large fortune from Leeds, who studies physic as an amusement, and is an excellent botanist; but has just left Edinburgh and &#x27;tis uncertain whether he will return&#x27;. It is unclear whether he completed his studies and graduated, not uncommon at that time among those with a substantial inheritance.

About this time, Richard Markham changed his name to Richard Salisbury. Later, Markham wrote to Joseph Banks that in 1785, Anna Salisbury, an elderly spinster without heirs who was a distant relative of his mother and who shared his love of plants, had settled on him a substantial amount of money. The condition was that he adopt her name, which she stated was an ancient and illustrious Welsh family. He was never able to produce any documentation to this effect and later it was claimed that he had admitted to having invented the story. 

Following his studies, Markham, now Salisbury pursued the life of country gentleman of wealth at Chapel Allerton, Leeds, one of his father&#x27;s estates. He developed substantial gardens and a large hothouse and a circle of wealthy local landowners who were equally enthusiastic about horticulture. For instance, he received an invitation to redesign the grounds of Harewood House. At the same time he developed a corresponding relationship with many leading botanists, and visited herbaria in Paris and London. There, he visited Banks, who remained his loyal friend for the rest of his life. He received recognition through election to the Royal Society and the Linnean Society in 1787. 

Salisbury married Caroline Staniforth in 1796. One child, Eleanor, was born to the couple in 1797; the two separated shortly thereafter. Salisbury had apparently misrepresented his finances when he had proposed marriage, and had large debts at the time of his daughter&#x27;s birth and had declared bankruptcy for dubious purposes. His honesty in legal and financial matters seems to have been questionable, if not devious. He apparently recovered financially by 1802, when he bought a house.

Salisbury contributed annotations to Edward Rudge&#x27;s &quot;Plantarum Guianæ Icones&quot; (1805–07), and descriptions to &quot;Paradisus Londinensis&quot; (1806–09). The latter was illustrated by William Hooker, and contained the genus name &quot;Hookera&quot; honouring him. Smith improperly renamed the genus &quot;Brodiaea&quot; a few years later, after his wealthy &quot;friend and patron&quot;, James Brodie of Brodie. 

In 1809, Salisbury was appointed the first honorary secretary of the Horticultural Society. His successor Joseph Sabine found he had left the accounts in disarray. He moved to London around this time; his small garden contained a large number of exotic and rare plants.

Salisbury opposed the use of Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;systema sexuale&quot; for classifying plants, which was one reason why others ignored his work. Another was the belief that Salisbury had behaved unethically. The censure was later reported as:

In July 1818, an anonymous article appeared in &quot;The Monthly Review&quot; (86: 298–305) that was highly critical of Brown&#x27;s account of plants acquired on a Congo expedition. Brown and others had little difficulty discerning that the author was Salisbury, prompting the former to complain to Smith the following month. However, there was already considerable ill feeling between the two botanists, due to Salisbury&#x27;s use of Brown&#x27;s work, but also his falling out with Smith, from the early days of the century. Smith referred to Salisbury&#x27;s contributions as &quot;trash&quot; in 1807. 

In addition to the allegations of plagiarism, Salisbury was known as a man who was difficult to get along with, was frequently involved in disputes with his contemporaries and was shunned by many botanists of his day. Nonetheless, he was a meticulous botanist and illustrator who contributed significantly to both the science and to horticulture. His contributions to English botany include a Corsican pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;) delivered to Kew Gardens, and his herbarium was also passed there via his adopted son, Matthew Burchill. Salisbury had met Alphonse de Candolle in his later years, and offered to leave him his inheritance if he would take the name of &#x27;Salisbury&#x27;.

He died in 1829. His manuscripts were obtained by John Edward Gray, who published part as &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; and deposited the remaining documents at the British Museum.
The portrait in pencil by Burchell (1817), acquired by Kew, and Smith&#x27;s genus &quot;Salisburia&quot;, a synonym for &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, denote his part in the history of British botany. At that time (1797), he was still on good terms with Smith, who wrote &quot;named in honour of Richard Anthony Salisbury, Esq., F.R.S. and F.L.S. of whose acuteness and indefatigable zeal in the service of botany no testimony is necessary in this society, nor in any place which his writings have reached&quot;.

== Work ==

Salisbury&#x27;s first known publication was his &quot;Icones stirpium rariorum descriptionibus illustratae&quot; (1791), a collection of 11 hand coloured plates, including the first description of &quot;Canna flaccida&quot;, which therefore bears his name as the botanical authority .This was followed in 1796 with an account of the plants on his Chapel Allerton estate.

Salisbury was unpopular with his contemporaries for his rejection, (subsequently demonstrated to be correct (of the Linnaen system of plant classification, the &quot;systema sexuale&quot;) still supported by Smith among others. Salisbury promoted the natural system instead. In 1796, at his own expense, Salisbury published a comprehensive account of the plants at Chapel Allerton He published a manuscript in 1809 under the name of a friend, Joseph Knight, entitled &quot;On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae&quot;, which contained only 13 pages related to cultivation techniques, but over 100 pages of taxonomic revision. However, it turned out that the work had nonetheless freely plagiarised the work of yet another botanist (Brown) who was at odds with Salisbury. Salisbury had memorised the plant names from Robert Brown&#x27;s reading of his &quot;On the Proteaceae of Jussieu&quot; to the Linnean Society of London in the first quarter of 1809, which was subsequently published in March 1810. Knight and Salisbury thus beat Brown to print and claimed priority for the names that Brown had authored.

Salisbury was accused of plagiarism, ostracised from botanical circles, and his publications were largely ignored during his lifetime. Samuel Goodenough wrote:

Robert Brown himself wrote of Salisbury:

Although Salisbury&#x27;s generic names have almost all been overturned, many of his specific epithets have been reinstated; since the nominal author was Knight, not Salisbury, Knight is now considered the author of a great many Proteaceae species.

<text>Jam is a British experimental black comedy sketch show, created, co-written, produced and directed by Chris Morris. It was broadcast on Channel 4 between 23 March and 27 April 2000. It was based on the earlier BBC Radio 1 show, &quot;Blue Jam&quot;, and consists of an unconnected series of disturbing and surreal sketches, unfolding over an ambient soundtrack. Many of the sketches re-used the original radio soundtracks with the actors lip-synching their lines, an unusual technique which added to the programme&#x27;s unsettling atmosphere, and featured unorthodox use of visual effects and sound manipulation.

The sketches themselves would often begin with a simple premise, e.g. two parents showing indifference to the whereabouts of their young child, and then escalate it with ever-more disturbing developments (the parents being phoned to come and identify the child&#x27;s corpse, but asking if it can instead be taxied to their home, as they do not want to interrupt their evening). The cast, composed of actors Morris had worked with in his early satirical shows, such as &quot;The Day Today&quot; and &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, included Amelia Bullmore, David Cann, Julia Davis, Kevin Eldon and Mark Heap, as well as occasional appearances from Morris himself.

Morris introduced each episode in the style of a surreal compère, reading free-form poetry over a nightmarish montage, often depicting someone as their life spirals out of control (for instance, one montage sees an unkempt man drinking from a bottle in a bag as he walks down the street, before being kidnapped by &quot;dung-breathed men&quot; and forced to wrestle pigs in the Fens).

&quot;Jam&quot; was co-written by Peter Baynham, with additional material contributed by Jane Bussmann, David Quantick, Graham Linehan, Arthur Mathews and the cast themselves. The show perplexed audiences and critics on its initial broadcast. Some hailed it as breakthrough, daringly original television, while others dismissed it as merely sickening and juvenile.

==Structure==

&quot;Jam&quot; is a black comedy.

The show had no opening or closing titles, the latter replaced with its now-defunct web address, www.jamcredits.com. Instead, it would begin with a disturbing monologue by Morris, coupled with a corresponding montage. These would, to some degree or other, follow a character as their nightmares are made real, or their preconceptions are shattered, leaving them in a bleak reality (i.e. a woman walking her dog, only to discover it is just skeletal remains). Morris would then say: &quot;Then welcome&quot;, followed by a nonsensical sentence (e.g. &quot;Ooh, astonishing sod ape&quot;), before finally announcing: &quot;Welcome... in Jam&quot;. The word &quot;jam&quot; would rarely be said normally; it would either be heavily distorted, spoken in a strange accent, or just screamed repeatedly at the viewer.

The series consisted of six twenty-minute episodes, and, unusually for a TV show on a commercial channel, had no advert break in the middle, which was the first time an entertainment show had run without ads on Channel 4. Morris has said that he asked Channel 4 to broadcast it without a break so as to not spoil the atmosphere. Sketches often had a documentary feel to them, the characters acting as if they were being interviewed about recent events.

The series had a late-night remix version during the &quot;4Later&quot; slot, entitled &quot;Jaaaaam&quot;. Its audiovisual distortions of the original series introduced the musical remix concept to British television. Morris further aped music culture through the creation of a fluid sound mix, with music, speech and other sound effects, drawing on the work of ambient DJs.

==Reception==

&quot;Jam&quot; received a mixed reaction from critics, with views ranging from &quot;the most radical and original television programme broadcast in years&quot; to accusations of it being &quot;adolescent&quot;, &quot;sick&quot;, and &quot;self-indulgent&quot;. The show received a number of complaints and was criticised by the Broadcasting Standards Commission. It is not generally as recognised as Morris&#x27;s earlier, satirical TV work, and remains a cult show.

Three complaints about &quot;Jam&quot; were upheld. These concerned the sketches &quot;Coffin Mistake&quot;, &quot;Sex for Houses&quot;, and &quot;Plumber Baby&quot;, as they were deemed insensitive to the bereaved and those with learning difficulties. The sketches in question dealt, respectively, with a man delivering a small homemade coffin to a couple whose child was stillborn, a couple prostituting the husband&#x27;s mentally disabled sister as part of a property deal, and a bereaved mother who bribes a plumber to &quot;fix&quot; her dead baby in the way he would a boiler.

Five of the show&#x27;s six episodes were classified &quot;18&quot; by the BBFC for very strong language and sexual content (particularly the &quot;Gush&quot; sketch, which depicts a prosthetic erection and fake semen, in a story about a pornographic film where the male actors die due to excessive ejaculation). Despite its content, the broadcast attracted nowhere near the controversy that the following year&#x27;s &quot;Brass Eye&quot; special, &quot;Paedogeddon&quot;, about media panic surrounding paedophilia, did.

In a 2008 interview, contributor Graham Linehan admitted he felt out of place during writing, and had mixed feelings about &quot;Jam&quot;: &quot;&quot;Jam&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be my favourite thing of Chris&#x27;s, and it was the one where I didn&#x27;t really feel like we were contributing a lot. Its mood was so grim that I just found it difficult to join in. I think that Chris was just interested in tying people in moral knots—giving them a moral problem and then just twisting it so they have to do something awful to get out of the first moral problem. Although this is a secondary impulse for him, he&#x27;s also interested in pushing buttons that haven&#x27;t been pushed in comedy in people; making them laugh in a way that they&#x27;re not used to. [...] Personally, I just want to make people laugh.&quot;

The show was featured on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Scary Moments&quot;.

Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish parodied &quot;Jam&quot; in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot;. Entitled &quot;Goitre&quot;, the sketch saw the two make a very amateurish attempt at creating unsettling sketches. One such sketch involved a repair man who found a &quot;dead baby&quot; (actually a doll) behind a TV and insisted he would have to &quot;bugger&quot; it in order to fix the television. The sketch later appeared as an extra feature on the &quot;Jam&quot; DVD.

==Episode list==
==Home video==
&quot;Jam&quot; was released to DVD in April, 2003, and has numerous pointless extras. For instance, each episode has both a &quot;normal version&quot; and a &quot;special version&quot;. Other &quot;versions&quot; include a miniaturised version, a miniaturised moving version, a lava lamp version, a fast-forwarded version, the first 19 seconds of the episode only, and a fast-forwarded version expanded to the original running time. This last is the only one reasonably capable of being watched without extreme difficulty. In addition, the items listed under the &quot;Extras&quot; on the disc are, much of the time, little more than additional copies of sketches, with the occasional deleted scene or shot of an audition or rehearsal. The only exceptions are Adam and Joe&#x27;s &quot;Goitre&quot; parody of &quot;Jam&quot;, and a link to &quot;Undeleted Scenes&quot;, which, when selected, advises the viewer to take the DVD back to the shop they bought it from and complain &quot;loudly and obnoxiously&quot; about the lack of undeleted scenes.

When attempting to change the audio settings to surround sound, the DVD provides the viewer a link to an MP3 file (no longer hosted) on the show&#x27;s official site and advises that it should be played from behind the viewer while watching the show; the file was a mono recording of wind, thumps and distant artillery.

===Easter eggs===
*Selecting &quot;Play All At Once&quot; from the &quot;Play All&quot; menu reveals a large red dot; by pressing the select button on the DVD remote when this is shown, an audition for a deleted scene can be seen.
*At the end of episode three, just before the Talkback Productions credit is shown, a dog&#x27;s face is flashed up on screen for a few seconds, with a red dot. When the dot appears, pressing select will show the trailer for Morris&#x27;s 2003 short film, &quot;My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117&quot;. The film is an adaptation of a story from &quot;Blue Jam&quot;, about a dog that takes over the life of its minder. Numerous brief images depicting scenes similar to those in &quot;My Wrongs&quot; appear throughout &quot;Jam&quot;, suggesting that there had been a previous, aborted attempt to film this story as a sketch.
*Selecting &quot;Play All Once&quot; will, obviously, show the episodes in order, but at the end of episode two, just before episode three, a backstage look at the filming of the &quot;Gush&quot; porn film is shown. It is regarded as an outtake due to the laughter at the end.
*At the end of &quot;London/Tokyo Jam Exhibition&quot;, a rehearsal for a deleted scene starring Kevin Eldon is shown. The scene is similar to the &quot;45-year-old little girl&quot; sketch in episode six. It is an adaptation of the &quot;Optician&quot; sketch from episode two of &quot;Blue Jam&quot;.

<text>Guy André (born November 17, 1959) is a Canadian politician who was elected to the House of Commons from the riding of Berthier—Maskinongé from 2004 to 2011. He is a member of the Bloc Québécois.

A social worker who lives in Pointe-du-Lac, a former city which is now a borough of Trois-Rivières, André was first elected to Parliament in the 2004 federal election. He was reelected without serious difficulty until he was defeated by NDP challenger Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the unexpected &quot;orange wave&quot; that swept through Quebec in the 2011 federal election. André had never received less than 45 percent of the vote but was held to only 29.4 percent in 2011.

He was considered a member of the &quot;pur et dur&quot; (hardline) faction of the Quebec sovereignty movement.

<text>Wilbert Robinson (June 29, 1864 – August 8, 1934), nicknamed &quot;Uncle Robbie&quot;, was an American catcher, coach and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Philadelphia Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, and St. Louis Cardinals. He managed the Orioles and Brooklyn Robins. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945.

== Life and playing career ==

Born in Bolton, Massachusetts, Robinson was a catcher in the minor New England League in 1885 and made it to the major leagues in 1886 with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association, where he remained until 1890. He lasted in the majors until 1902, playing much of his career with two separate Baltimore Orioles franchises – from 1890 to 1899 with the Orioles team which folded after the 1899 National League season, and in 1901–02 with the American League team which moved to New York City in 1903 and became the Yankees. He also spent one season, 1900, with the St. Louis Cardinals.

Over the course of his career, Robinson played 1,316 games as a catcher, which prepared him for his second baseball career as a manager. The star catcher of the Orioles dynasty which won three straight titles from 1894 to 1896, he compiled a career batting average of .273, with a peak of .353 in the heavy-hitting season of 1894. Durable behind the plate, he caught a in 1896, followed by a double-header the following day. He also was the first catcher to play directly behind the batter at all times, as the previous practice had been to play farther back when there were fewer than two strikes. A highlight of his career was a seven-hit game June 10, 1892. He also batted in 11 runs in that game; on September 16, 1924, as manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, he saw that record eclipsed as Jim Bottomley of the St. Louis Cardinals batted in 12 runs. (Robinson, whose team was in contention for the pennant at the time, lamented, &quot;Why did he have to save all those hits for us? Couldn&#x27;t he have made some of them against Giants manager] McGraw?&quot;)

==Managerial career==
===Baltimore and New York===
Robinson and McGraw joined as business partners in the Baltimore Orioles, a team that would debut in the new American League (AL) in 1901. McGraw served as player-manager of the AL Orioles in 1901 and the beginning of the 1902 season, at which point he departed to the New York Giants. There were rumblings of a move to New York City to counter the Giants to help the fledgling League before the season had started, but nothing came to pass yet. The 1902 season was the last for the Orioles in the American League. Robinson took over after McGraw had gone 26–31 to manage the last 83 games. He won 24 while losing 57 (with two ties). The team had been plagued by debt suffered by owner John Mahon. Andrew Freedman and John T. Brush, principal owners of the Giants and Cincinnati Reds, respectively, purchased the team and raided the roster by releasing certain players to be claimed by the two teams. A.L President Ban Johnson seized control of the Orioles not long after and loaned several players from other A.L teams, but the damage was done. After the season, McGraw enticed Robinson to be his pitching coach from 1903 to 1913 (although he would also do some coaching at third base), during which time the Giants won five NL pennants and a World Series title in 1905. As for the Orioles, they moved to New York for 1903. An argument between the two after the 1913 World Series over alleged bad coaching by either man in a saloon (meant to reunite old Oriole teammates) meant the beginning of a feud between the two that never formally healed, and Robinson left to manage Brooklyn in 1914.

===Brooklyn Dodgers ===
In 1914, Robinson took over the National League Brooklyn franchise. The team was known by various nicknames, including Bridegrooms, Superbas, and Dodgers, but during Robinson&#x27;s managerial tenure, which lasted until 1931, the club was as often referred to as the &quot;Robins&quot; in honor of their manager, who had acquired the nickname &quot;Uncle Robbie.&quot; (The frequently error-prone Dodger teams of this era were also sometimes derisively known as &quot;Uncle Robbie&#x27;s Daffiness Boys.&quot;) The Dodgers had finished the previous year with a 65-84 record that was buoyed by stars such as Zack Wheat and Jake Daubert (with the latter having won the National League&#x27;s MVP award). Robinson would lead them to a 75-79 record in 1914, games behind first while finishing 5th for the first time since 1907. He followed it up with an 80-72-2 second season that had them finish third in the League while acquiring future Hall of Fame pitcher Rube Marquard from New York.

By the halfway point of the 1916 season, the Robins were already 15 games above .500. By the time of October, the Robins were holding firm with 91 wins and a bare lead over the Philadelphia Phillies. Facing New York for the final four-game series, they won three to clinch the pennant. It was the first time Brooklyn had won the pennant since 1900, and they would compete in their first ever World Series. They would face the Boston Red Sox, managed by Bill Carrigan that had future Hall of Famers with Babe Ruth and Harry Hooper while making their fourth appearance in the World Series in thirteen years. The Red Sox would win the title, which was the third in four that they would win from 1912 to 1918. Marquard was outmatched in Game 1 by Ernie Shore, as Boston had a 6-1 lead before Brooklyn came close to rallying in the ninth inning, when Carl Mays was brought in to curtail a bases-loaded situation that led to Brooklyn scoring four runs but falling one run short. Boston then won Game 2 in fourteen innings, which featured no scoring for ten straight innings until Boston had a walk-off single. Brooklyn scored in the first inning of that game and promptly did not score again until the 3rd inning of the next game. Brooklyn held on to bounce back in Game 3 after nearly blowing a 4-0 lead, but Boston rallied in Game 4 with a three-run inside-the-park home run by Larry Gardner proving the difference in a 6-2 game. Game 5 featured Boston scoring four unanswered after Brooklyn had a brief lead in the second inning, as Boston won the series in five games (they batted .238 for the series, but Brooklyn batted .200). Brooklyn slumped in the next three seasons, finishing 70-81-5 for a seventh place finish in 1917 before finishing 5th in the next two years, although a trade for Burleigh Grimes (a fellow future Hall of Famer) in 1918 would be a helping hand soon enough. However, in 1920, he led them to a 24-game improvement with 93 wins in 155 games for a seven game cushion over New York for Brooklyn&#x27;s second pennant in four years. However, the Cleveland Indians (led by player/manager Tris Speaker) would win the World Series five games to two in a series that saw no lead changes at any point, as the team that scored first won the game, with Cleveland scoring as early as the first inning (twice) and as late as the sixth (Game 6). Brooklyn was outscored 21-8.

Robinson continued to manage the Robins for eleven more seasons, with five winning seasons in the mix. His best finish was the 1924 team, which finished 2nd with a 92-62 record while being buoyed by NL MVP Dazzy Vance, who had completed the Triple Crown in leading the NL in wins (28), strikeouts (262) and ERA (2.16). The Robins had a slow run going into August, which included being down by as many as 13 games for first on the 9th. However, the Robins went on a 13-game winning streak from August 25 to September 6, and they were tied for the NL lead three times in the month. On September 23, with four games to play, the Robins were tied for the lead with the Giants before facing the Chicago Cubs (soon tabbed to finish 5th in the standings) and the Boston Braves (the league doormat) for two games each, with Vance tabbed to start two of them (the Giants, however, had five games left to play). However, they would win and lose twice, which included a 10th inning home run off Vance by Gabby Hartnett on the 23rd that doomed the Robins. The Giants finished at 93-60 to finish games in first.

The Robins also had their share of struggles, which included seven times of finishing in the second division (below 4th), including five in a row from 1925 to 1929, which coincided with Robinson serving as both manager and team president (having been named after owner Charles Ebbets had died). Robinson finished his career with two fourth place finishes in 1930 and 1931. He closed out his career on September 27, 1931 in Ebbets Field, fittingly against McGraw and his New York Giants. Robinson&#x27;s Robins won 12-3. He was replaced by Max Carey as manager while hunting at his camp in Brunswick, Georgia.

In his 18 years at the helm of the Robins, Robinson compiled a record of 1,375–1,341–19, including National League championships in 1916 and 1920 – Brooklyn&#x27;s only pennants between 1901 and 1940. His 1,375 NL victories were, at the time, the 3rd-highest total in National League history, trailing only the totals of John McGraw (then with 2,652) and Fred Clarke (1,602).

Robinson was highly regarded for his ability to draw outstanding performances from his pitching staffs, a result of his many years as a catcher. Among the pitchers he guided to success were Joe McGinnity with both Orioles teams and the Giants, Rube Marquard with the Giants, and Dazzy Vance and Burleigh Grimes with the Dodgers. Another pitcher who would later recall Robinson&#x27;s excellent advice, although they never played together during a regular season, was John Tener, who in the 1910s served simultaneously as NL president and Governor of Pennsylvania.

Robinson was manager when Al López started out as a catcher in the majors, as Lopez made his debut in 1928 before becoming a regular in 1930 who spent the first six seasons of a 19-year career with Brooklyn. Robinson watched Lopez&#x27; style and finally hollered, &quot;Tell that punk he got two hands to catch with! Never mind the stuff.&quot; Lopez went on to eventually surpass Robinson in the number of games played as catcher (1,316) and Lopez in the most games caught at 1,918 in 1945. That record was not broken for four decades; in 1951, Lopez became a manager and won two pennants and 1,410 games in seventeen seasons that led to his induction into the Hall of Fame.

==Managerial record==
==Retirement and death==
After his retirement from managing, Robinson became the president of the Atlanta Crackers minor league team. He suffered a fall in his hotel room in August 1934, resulting in a broken arm and a head injury. On August 8, he suffered a brain hemorrhage and died in Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 70. He was buried in the New Cathedral Cemetery in Baltimore. His resting place is located near the grave of John McGraw, who had died in February of that year.

==Family==
Robinson&#x27;s brother, Fred Robinson, also played briefly in the majors, appearing in 3 games for the 1884 Cincinnati Outlaw Reds of the Union Association.

== Legacy ==
Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 by the Old-Timers Committee. One reporter had described him as a &quot;Rule-of-thumb manager, a gentle Falstaff, who could get more out of less material than any manager before or since.&quot; Noted baseball analyst Bill James, looking at all elected managers in the Hall of Fame based on meeting expectations in regards to record, described his election as &quot;capricious&quot;.

===Robinson and Ruth Law===
On March 13, 1915, at spring training in Daytona Beach, Florida, Robinson decided to try to set a record of sorts by catching a baseball dropped from an airplane being flown overhead, being inspired by aviator Ruth Law&#x27;s penchant for dropping golf balls from the plane onto the nearby golf course. This was not the first stunt involving catching a fly ball from a considerable distance, as Gabby Street had caught a ball dropped from the Washington Monument on August 21, 1908, after 14 misses. Law and team trainer Fred Kelly would be on the plane for the stunt. However, Law had somehow forgot to bring the baseball and instead dropped a grapefruit, which splattered all over the manager. The grapefruit made such a mess that Robinson thought he had lost his eye because of the acid and the bloodlike splatter that covered him, and he began screaming before his teammates began to laugh at the sight of a grapefruit-covered teammate and he realized that it was a joke. From this point on, Robinson referred to airplanes as fruit flies and according to legend it is the reason that the spring training Grapefruit League got its nickname.

<text>The Adorno family was a noble family of the Republic of Genoa, with the branches of Botta in Milan, several of whom were Doges of the republic.
The family is considered one of the most influential in the history of the republic.

The elder branch was extinct in 1634, and the titles, fiefdoms and surname were inherited by the Botta family of Milan, which has since been called Botta Adorno. The Botta family has been attested since 1298, with the progenitor Simone Botta, a citizen of Cremona. The Botta Adorno became extinct in 1882.

They were generally rivals of the Fregoso family. Both families rose to power in the late 14th century.

<text>Michael John Gilmour Howlett (born 27 April 1950) is a bass guitar player, record producer and teacher based in the United Kingdom and Australia.

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Howlett was the bassist in Sydney pop band the Affair, which included vocalist Kerrie Biddell. The group travelled to England after winning a prize in the Hoadley&#x27;s Battle of the Sounds band competition. Howlett settled in London and in 1973 joined renowned British progressive rock group Gong, which had been founded by an Australian expatriate, Daevid Allen. He remained with Gong until 1977, recording several albums with them and co-writing much of their material later in this period with drummer Pierre Moerlen.

After leaving Gong, Howlett formed the short-lived band Strontium 90, which consisted of himself, Sting, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers. In addition to being the band&#x27;s lead bassist and chief songwriter, Howlett performed most of the lead vocals in live performances. The band recorded several demos and played at a Paris Gong reunion concert in May 1977, but disbanded when Summers left to join Copeland and Sting&#x27;s other project, the Police. An archival collection of Strontium 90 material was released two decades later as &quot;Strontium 90: Police Academy&quot;.

A few months after the breakup of Strontium 90, Howlett served as bassist for the one-off studio band The Radio Actors, which also included Gong bandmate Steve Hillage on lead guitar and Strontium 90 bandmate Sting (who came to the group by way of Howlett&#x27;s recommendation) on lead vocals. The band&#x27;s single, &quot;Nuclear Waste&quot; b/w &quot;Digital Love&quot;, was reissued on CD in 1995 with liner notes and three bonus tracks, though none of the bonus tracks involved Howlett.

In the 1980s, Howlett became an in-demand producer, with a string of notable credits. He produced many hit singles and albums for leading new wave music acts including A Flock of Seagulls, the Alarm, China Crisis, Martha and the Muffins, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Stephen Duffy, Gang of Four and Comsat Angels. He also produced the album &quot;Secret Secrets&quot; for Joan Armatrading in 1985.

Gong performs occasional reunion gigs around the world, and Howlett usually joins them. In 1993, he launched a record label, Mauve, which released albums by singer-songwriters Rafa Russo, Debbie Cassell and Jay Fisher. From 2005 to 2009, Howlett was chairman of the Music Producers Guild (MPG).

Howlett was awarded a PhD on the subject of record production in 2009 and has lectured in music technology at several universities, including the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales) in Pontypridd, Wales and Thames Valley University (Ealing, London). In 2009, he became Head of Music at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia and is an adjunct professor for QUT.

Howlett is married with three children and two grandchildren. He lives in West London.

<doc id="633786" wikidata="Q5069904" url="?curid=633786" title="Champagne unit">
<text>A champagne unit is a US military unit staffed by celebrities or people from wealthy or politically powerful families. Such units had often been part of the National Guard, and assigned to lower-risk duty inside the United States. The term is pejorative, with the connotation that such units were havens for those with connections who wished to avoid conscription into more dangerous duty while still gaining the prestige afforded in the United States to military service. Over a century earlier, such a unit was called a silk-stocking regiment after the New York&#x27;s 7th Regiment, whose well-off members built their own armory, the Seventh Regiment Armory on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

==Vietnam War==
During the Vietnam War, serving in the Army and Air National Guard or the military Reserve components was generally regarded as a guaranteed way to avoid the dangers of combat. Although National Guard and Reserve units had been called to active duty in every war since they were founded, the risk was extremely low in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Only 8,700 of these servicemen were ordered to South Vietnam, a tiny 0.3% of the total American military personnel who actually served there. Furthermore, a greatly disproportionate number of famous, wealthy, or politically connected young men received hard to get places in the National Guard or Reserves during Vietnam, including 360 professional athletes such as Bill Bradley and Nolan Ryan.

Commenting on this disparity, General Colin Powell wrote in his autobiography, &quot;I am angry that so many sons of the powerful and well placed and many professional athletes (who were probably healthier than any of us) managed to wrangle slots in Reserve and National Guard units. Of the many tragedies of Vietnam, this raw class discrimination strikes me as the most damaging to the ideal that all Americans are created equal and owe equal allegiance to our country.&quot;

== 147th Fighter Group ==
One well known champagne unit was the Texas Air National Guard&#x27;s 147th Fighter Interceptor Group, at Ellington Field in Houston. During the Vietnam War many well-connected sons served in this unit, sometimes with the help of politicians such as Ben Barnes.

* Lloyd Bentsen Jr., son of Lloyd Bentsen
* George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush
* John Connally III, son of John Connally Jr.
* the son of John Tower
* James R. Bath
* seven members of the Dallas Cowboys

== Decline ==
The Total Force Policy, implemented by General Creighton Abrams in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, eliminated the National Guard and Reserve as safe havens from combat. In contrast to the Vietnam War, National Guard and Reserve units in 2004 comprised 40 percent of all US military forces serving in Iraq. As of 2006, 270,000 National Guard members (60% of the total force) had been deployed overseas for the maximum amount of time allowed by military regulations.

<text>Sludge metal (also known as sludge doom or simply sludge) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that combines elements of doom metal and hardcore punk. The genre generally includes slow tempos, tuned down guitars and nihilistic lyrics discussing poverty, drug addiction and pollution.

The sound of sludge metal has its origins in California hardcore punk bands in the early-to-mid-1980s like Black Flag, Flipper and Fang, who began slowing their tempos and embracing the influence of Black Sabbath. This sound was expanded upon by the Melvins towards the end of the decade and the bands they influenced in both the Seattle grunge scene, and in Louisiana with Eyehategod, Crowbar and Acid Bath. In the 1990s and 2000s, the sound of sludge diversified: bands including Neurosis, Isis and Cult of Luna helped to pioneer post-metal, while Baroness and Mastodon fused the genre with progressive metal, while Dystopia did so with crust punk and Grief with anarcho-punk.

==Characteristics==

The key characteristics of sludge metal are a slow tempo combined with down-tuned, heavily distorted guitars. However, some bands do make use of tempo changes into faster sections. The key element that differentiates sludge from other doom metal derived styles is its influence from hardcore punk, particularly the genre&#x27;s use of high aggression and screamed vocals, though the genre can include sung vocals. Many sludge bands also make use of elements of industrial music, southern rock and blues. &quot;Bandcamp Daily&quot; writer Noah Berlatsky described the genre as &quot;visceral and ugly&quot;.

Sludge metal&#x27;s lyrics explore real-world themes, while often also making light of the darkness of these topics. Drug addiction is a common theme, while discussion of poverty and pollution are also prevalent.

Sludge bands who lean more towards hardcore are sometimes called sludgecore by music historians including Garry Sharpe-Young and David Pearson. New Orleans is the birthplace of the sludgecore movement, with Eyehategod being this style&#x27;s frontrunner. More recently, sludgecore bands like the Abominable Iron Sloth, Admiral Angry and Black Sheep Wall have emerged.

==History==

Since its inception in the late 1970s, the sound of hardcore punk was primarily defined by its high tempos. However, by the early-to-mid-1980s, a crop of bands, particularly California groups Black Flag, Fang and Flipper, began to play slower tempos as a way of antagonizing many in the scene. As early as 1982, Flipper&#x27;s &quot;Album – Generic Flipper&quot; made use of dirgey, low tempos and expansive song lengths in the case of &quot;(I Saw You) Shine&quot;, to create what, in his book &quot;Monolithic Undertow In Search of Sonic Oblivion&quot;, writer Harry Sword credited as the &quot;genesis of sludge metal&quot;. Furthermore, Los Angeles band Saint Vitus, one of the forefront groups in the still emerging doom metal genre, released their &quot;self-titled debut&quot; album through SST Records in 1984. The album&#x27;s title track, merged the band&#x27;s usual doom metal style with elements of punk to create a mid-tempo hardcore track which writer J. J. Anselmi described as &quot;the first sludge metal song on record&quot;. However, it was the three track B-side of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;My War&quot; (1984) and its embrace of Black Sabbath influence, that is generally accredited as beginning the sludge metal genre.

Early on &quot;My War&quot;&#x27;s influence took a particular hold on Seattle, Washington&#x27;s burgeoning grunge scene, inspiring some of the scene&#x27;s earliest bands like 10 Minute Warning and the U-Men. The Melvins, formed in Montesano, Washington in 1983, were one of the most prominent bands in the scene to embrace the influence of both &quot;My War&quot; and &quot;Album – Generic Flipper&quot;, and would go on to be described by publications such as &quot;Revolver&quot; as the band that &quot;invented sludge&quot;. Beginning their career by playing hardcore, the band began playing &quot;slow and heavy riffs&quot; after seeing Black Flag in Seattle in 1984, to form a dirge-like music that inspired much of the subsequent sludge and grunge bands. The grunge scene became sludge&#x27;s most commercially successful moment, with groups like Soundgarden and Nirvana achieving widespread mainstream success in the early 1990s, playing music that merged the genre with alternative rock.
By the 1990s, Louisiana developed one of the largest and most influential sludge metal scenes, with bands like Acid Bath, Crowbar and Eyehategod. Eyehategod were one of the first sludge bands to form in the state at a time when the majority of local bands were fast. The band purposefully rebelled against this, embracing the influence of Black Sabbath and Black Flag, as a means to antagonize their peers. In the following years, Eyehategod became one of the defining and most influential bands in the genre: their second album &quot;Take as Needed for Pain&quot; (1993), inspired a multitude of bands to form or change sounds; and Eyehategod&#x27;s members would go on to be a part of other defining New Orleans sludge bands including Soilent Green, Crowbar and Down. In a 2009 interview with &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine, Down vocalist Phil Anselmo stated &quot;Back in those days, everything in the underground was fast, fast, fast. It was the rule of the day...But when the Melvins came out with their first record, &quot;Gluey Porch Treatments&quot;, it really broke the mold, especially in New Orleans. People began to appreciate playing slower.&quot;

The 924 Gilman Street punk scene in Berkeley, California produced a sizeable sludge metal scene in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, which included Neurosis and Noothgrush. Neurosis&#x27; transition from playing hardcore to a droning, ambient and progressive style of sludge metal helped pioneer the post-metal genre, then joined by Boston&#x27;s Isis and Umeå&#x27;s Cult of Luna in the following years. Around the same time, Orange County, California&#x27;s Dystopia released their debut album &quot;Human = Garbage&quot; which merged sludge metal with influences from crust punk and grindcore, while Boston&#x27;s Grief did the same with anarcho-punk. In the United Kingdom, both Fudge Tunnel and Iron Monkey were prominent bands in the 1990s who embraced the influence of the Melvins and nascent sound of sludge.

Damad formed in 1991 in Savannah, Georgia, releasing two studio albums &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; (1997) and &quot;Burning Cold&quot; (2000) which showcased both sludge and grindcore influenced punk. Damad&#x27;s influence led to Savannah developing a significant sludge metal scene in the 2000s which included Baroness, Black Tusk and Kylesa. Bands in the scenes&#x27; equal parts influence from punk, metal and rock led to writers like J.J. Anselmi referencing a &quot;Savannah sound&quot;. Baroness&#x27; progressive take on the style, which also incorporated elements alternative rock gained significant commercial success in the 2010s. Mastodon from Atlanta similarly merged the genre with progressive elements. The band&#x27;s first two albums &quot;Remission&quot; (2002) and &quot;Leviathan&quot; (2004) were cited by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; as two of the most important sludge metal albums of all time, however as the band progressed, they became increasingly indebted to progressive metal and less to sludge.

<doc id="633818" wikidata="Q3441634" url="?curid=633818" title="Roncesvalles, Toronto">
<text>Roncesvalles ( ), also known as or Roncesvalles Village or Roncy Village, is a neighbourhood in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, centred on Roncesvalles Avenue, a north–south street leading from the intersection of King and Queen Streets to the south, north to Dundas Street West, a distance of roughly 1.7 kilometres. It is located east of High Park, north of Lake Ontario, in the Parkdale–High Park provincial and federal ridings and the municipal Ward 4. Its informal boundaries are High Park to the west, Bloor Street West to the north, Lake Ontario/Queen Street West to the south and Lansdowne Avenue/rail corridor to the east. Originally known as &quot;Howard Park&quot;, most of this area was formerly within the boundaries of Parkdale and Brockton villages and was annexed into Toronto in the 1880s.

Culturally, the area is known as the centre of the Polish community in Toronto with prominent Polish institutions, businesses and St Casimir&#x27;s Catholic Church located on Roncesvalles Avenue. The businesses along Roncesvalles have formed the Roncesvalles Village Business Improvement Area and hold the largest Polish Festival in North America, which takes place every September.

==Character==
The neighbourhood is predominantly residential, with a commercial strip the full length of Roncesvalles, composed predominantly of small businesses, churches and institutions. To the west of Roncesvalles, the area is nearly completely residential except for St. Joseph&#x27;s Health Centre and a Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) streetcar barn. East of Roncesvalles along the CN and CP rail lines is an older industrial area that is in transition. Several of the buildings along Sorauren Avenue have been converted into loft-style condominiums. At one time a large TTC bus garage was located along Sorauren Avenue; this property has been converted into Sorauren Park. Two other old industrial buildings along Wabash are owned by the City of Toronto, and are slated for a future community centre project. One of the buildings currently serves as a clubhouse for the Park.

The City of Toronto defines three official neighbourhoods as having boundaries with Roncesvalles Avenue. To the west, the official neighbourhood is High Park-Swansea. To the east, the official neighbourhood is named &quot;Roncesvalles&quot; – often referred to as &quot;Roncy&quot;. To the southeast of Roncesvalles Avenue is &quot;South Parkdale&quot;.

==History==

Toronto&#x27;s first highway to the west was Dundas Street starting at Queen Street along today&#x27;s Ossington and west along its current path west to Dundas (near Hamilton). While Toronto&#x27;s boundary was Dufferin Street, a very early village mostly built around hotels sprang up along Dundas just before it met Ossington and entered Toronto; this was Brockton. The Subdivision of land for Brockton included the portion of the neighbourhood east of what is now Roncesvalles Avenue. although little of this was built on. The rest of what is now the Roncesvalles neighbourhood began as farm lots given to Toronto&#x27;s prominent Ridout family and the architect John George Howard. These men had careers in the city so little was done with their farmland most of which was never even cleared of the natural forest. Two houses were built by John Howard on these farms: Sunnyside (where St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital is now), and Colborne Lodge (Mr. Howard&#x27;s own cottage built 1837) in what is now High Park. A path running through Sunnyside Farm was an Indigenous trail (now Indian Road) thought to have originally been an ancient Mississauga Indian path, leading from Lake Ontario north. In the 1850s, concurrent with the building of the railway, the central part of Brockton was separated from the Roncesvalles subdivided lands except for a small strip along Dundas between the railway and Bloor.

In 1850, Colonel O&#x27;Hara acquired the land north of Queen from Roncesvalles Avenue to just east of Lansdowne Avenue. In 1874, Colonel O&#x27;Hara died and his land was subdivided. Following the subdivision of two other farms south of Queen, a new village rapidly took shape and in 1879 was incorporated, despite protests by the City of Toronto, as the Village of Parkdale. The subdivision of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s land and the streets laid out after his death had names related to his family, largely superseded the Brockton subdivision south of the railway between Roncesvalles and Sorauren. Development in Parkdale crept up Sorauren Ave and there was even some building on Roncesvalles Avenue before a series of annexations brought Parkdale (1889), Brockton (1884) and the surrounding farmland (including Sunnyside farm) into the City of Toronto. In all there were 13 separate annexations by the City of Toronto between 1883 and 1893.

When Parkdale was annexed to Toronto, streets were laid out or extended to Keele Street (the section south of Bloor was later renamed Parkside Drive) and the street grid took the shape it has to this day. In the 1890s, the intersection of Roncesvalles and Queen became more important as a Lake Shore streetcar line was built, enabling commuting to the west. A streetcar yard was added at the intersection in 1895. The Sunnyside railway station at the intersection was opened in 1912.

At the turn of the 20th century, the first school was built in the neighbourhood, the Old Howard Park school on Boustead Avenue. Although a number of Victorian homes had already been built extending north from Parkdale, the neighbourhood was largely built from 1900 until the First World War with almost all houses built in the &#x27;foursquare&#x27; style. Originally these homes were designed for the middle class while wealthier homes were found in Parkdale. Also at this time, the first four Carnegie Libraries were opened in Toronto. Apart from the Central Library all (three) libraries were identical, one of them being the High Park branch on Roncesvalles Avenue. The three original churches were also built at this time; St Vincent de Paul (Roman Catholic), St Jude&#x27;s (Anglican) and Howard Park Emmanuel (United Church). In the later years of its development, Roncesvalles began to attract some wealthier families and many impressive homes were built from 1910 to 1930 on High Park Gardens and High Park Boulevard.

The lakefront was developed by the Toronto Harbour Commission in the 1910s, leading to the development of the Sunnyside Beach and Amusement Park in 1922. Its popularity spurred development of the area commercially. The foot of Roncesvalles became a commercial and transportation hub, with a train station, a bus depot and the streetcar loop. The Park was demolished for the Gardiner Expressway project in 1955 and the Sunnyside intersection bypassed, leading to a decline in commerce and residential values in the area. The wealthy moved away from the area to newer suburbs further west and many large local homes were divided into apartments. However, Roncesvalles has remained largely middle class, attracting an influx of successful immigrants especially from Poland reversing the relationship between Roncesvalles and Parkdale. St Casimir&#x27;s Catholic Parish was established in 1944. The construction of the church and church hall began in 1948 and was completed in 1954 by which time the Polish community had become well established in the area. It was the construction of the church that attracted the Polish immigrants to the immediate area.

===Street names===
These names are attributed to Walter O&#x27;Hara:

* Roncesvalles Avenue,- O&#x27;Hara named it after the Battle of Roncesvalles which took place in the Roncesvalles gorge in Spain in 1813 in which he led a regiment that fought against the retreating army of Napoleon.
* Alhambra Avenue, after the palace in Spain,
* Constance Street, after his daughter,
* Fermanagh Avenue, after the county of his birth in Ireland,
* Geoffrey Street, after a son,
* Marion Street, after his wife, and
* Sorauren Avenue, is named after the Battle of Sorauren at which Col. O&#x27;Hara was present.

Fern Avenue used to be named Ruth Avenue, after his daughter and Grenadier Road used to be named Walter Avenue, after another son. The streets O&#x27;Hara Avenue and West Lodge Avenue both to the east were laid out and named after O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s death.

Other street names have historical connections:
*Sunnyside Ave, Parkside Dr, Colborne Lodge Drive (in High Park), Howard Park Avenue, High Park Gardens, High Park Boulevard, High Park Ave (in the High Park neighbourhood) – all relate to John Howard.
* Grenadier Road – (Grenadiers from Fort York were the first regular users of High Park).
* Indian Road, Indian Grove, Indian Road Crescent, Indian Valley Crescent, Indian Trail and Algonquin Ave – all named after the old native path.
* Ridout Street – the Ridout family, which owned property in the north-west vicinity of High Park.

==Culture==

The area has a highly developed history of political and community participation. There are several established community associations active. The High Park Residents&#x27; Association represents the area south of Bloor Street between Parkside Drive and Roncesvalles Avenue south to High Park Boulevard. The Sunnyside Community Association represents the area directly south of High Park Boulevard between Parkside and Roncesvalles, south to Lake Ontario. The Roncesvalles-MacDonnell Residents&#x27; Association represents the area east of Roncesvalles from Bloor south to Queen Street, east of Roncesvalles, south of the railway lines, west of Lansdowne Avenue.

In 2012, Roncesvalles was named as one of eight finalists in the &quot;Canadian Institute of Planners’ (CIP) Great Places in Canada&quot; contest, and the only neighbourhood from Toronto. From a poll of 200,000 votes nationwide, 90 neighbourhoods were nominated. A panel of planners reduced the list to 21 and Roncesvalles survived a second cut to make it to the top eight. According to CIP President Andrea Gabor: &quot;in Roncesvalles, people can bike in or get on a streetcar, so they still feel like part of the city and connected to the downtown ... I think it embodies a lot of what people want when they’re living in the city.&quot;

===Arts===

The popular repertory movie theatre Revue Cinema, at the intersection of Roncesvalles and Howard Park Avenue first opened its doors in 1911. It closed for a year as part of the dissolution of the Festival Cinemas chain. It reopened as a non-profit operation of the Revue Film Society. The Society laboured for a year to find a way to reopen the Revue, and partnered with a local couple who purchased the theatre and now leases it to the Society.

Another theatre, the Brighton, closed in the mid-1980s. It is in use as a convenience store, although it has not been renovated, other than its marquee signage removed.
The area has several bars and restaurants with live music. &quot;The Local&quot; pub offers live music daily. &quot;Inter Steer&quot; offers live music twice a week. &quot;Loons Restaurant &amp; Pub&quot; offers live music on Friday nights. &quot;Latinada&quot;, on Bloor Street west of Dundas, is a Tapas bar with live music. Zagłoba restaurant also offers live music. 

Annually in June, the &quot;Roncy Rocks&quot; one-day music and art show is held outdoors along Roncesvalles. Several side streets off Roncesvalles are closed and musical stages and art displays installed. Musicians and artists are mostly local to the community.

In 2018, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto Canada moved to a location in the former Tower Building nearby on Sterling Road. There are several independent art galleries on Dundas Street West between Sorauren Avenue and Roncesvalles.

===Polish community===
The street has long been known as the cultural and commercial centre of Toronto&#x27;s Polish Canadian community. A number of Polish-speaking restaurants, delicatessens and shops specializing in Polish goods are located on Roncesvalles Avenue. The sign &quot;Mówimy po polsku&quot; (&quot;We speak Polish&quot;) is displayed in some storefronts.


While still recognized as a centre of the Polish community, the ethnic makeup of the area around Roncesvalles Avenue varies widely, as is the case throughout Toronto. According to the 2006 census figures, in Ward 14, which includes Roncesvalles, there were 2,775 residents who identified Polish as their mother tongue, or 5.5% of the population. This is the second-largest group after English. According to the 2011 census, the overall number of residents of Toronto who identify Polish as their mother tongue is 27,880.

The Roncesvalles Village Business Improvement Area holds an annual Roncesvalles Village Polish Festival each fall, closing Roncesvalles Avenue to vehicular traffic. The festival features amusement rides, clothing, craft and food stands and outdoor musical entertainment, including polka music. In 2011, an estimated 300,000 people attended the festival. The official patron of the festival is the Polish Consulate. It is considered the largest Polish festival in North America.

The public library branch holds a collection of Polish-language books and magazines. Polish-language lessons are part of the curriculum at St. Vincent de Paul separate school.

At the southern end of Roncesvalles Avenue, at the Sunnyside intersection of King, Queen, Queensway and Roncesvalles streets, two monuments are erected in memory of two events in Polish history. A large monument in memory of the massacre of Polish prisoners of war during World War II, and especially the mass graves of officers found in Katyn forest. Fresh wreaths are placed there regularly. Next to it is a memorial to thousands of Polish citizens deported to Siberian labour camps during the Second World War.

In Poland, the Catholic faith is predominant, and this is the case for persons of Polish descent (&#x27;Polonia&#x27;) in Canada. There are two large Catholic churches on Roncesvalles. St. Casimir&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church offers Polish-language masses every Sunday. St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, at Westminster Avenue, holds masses in English and Latin.

An enormous memorial was held on Roncesvalles Avenue when Pope John Paul II died, with standing room only on the street and sidewalks of Roncesvalles from Marion Avenue to Wright Avenue. The memorial was loosely centred on a statue of the Pope located at the St. Stanislaus-St. Casimir&#x27;s Credit Union, a credit union for people of Polish descent. A tribute of candles and flowers around the statue continues today. When Pope John Paul II visited Toronto in 1984, he had visited Roncesvalles and dined at the Sir Nicholas Restaurant at 89 Roncesvalles.

==Institutions==
===Churches===
The Annunciation Of The Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Cathedral is located at Sorauren Avenue and Galley Avenue. Until 1961, it was the North Parkdale United Church, when it was purchased for $160,000. It was elevated to Cathedral status in 1967. Its interior was damaged by fire in 2000 but was refurbished.

Roncesvalles United Church, located at Wright Avenue, operates a mission and a daycare. The church was renamed Emmanuel – Howard Park in 1972, following the merger of its congregation with that of Howard Park United Church. Cheri DiNovo was the pastor of the church until she was elected as the current Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Parkdale–High Park in 2006. The former Howard Park Church is located at Sunnyside and Marmaduke and was converted into housing. As of 2016, Emmanuel – Howard Park was renamed Roncesvalles United Church. Services are also held by Roman Catholic Womenpriests at the church.

St. Casimir&#x27;s Polish Roman Catholic Church at Garden Avenue, offers Polish masses on Sundays. Its origins begin in 1944 when the Oblate Mission decided to create the third Polish parish (and first in the west end) in Toronto. The lot on which the church stands today was purchased for $15,000 in 1948 and construction on the parish hall began the same year. The first mass was held in the church hall in 1949. The church was completed and officially began offering mass on May 23, 1954. The founder and driving force behind the creation of the parish and church was Father Michael Smith who later went on to found Copernicus Lodge. The parish and church were important in the beginning of the Polish community in Toronto&#x27;s west end.

St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church, at Westminster Avenue, offers Latin masses on Sundays. It is the &#x27;mother&#x27; parish of St. Casimir&#x27;s and was built in the 1910s.

Westminster Chapel at High Park is a merger of Westminster Chapel and High Park Baptist Church. Westminster Chapel at High Park is located on Hewitt Avenue. High Park Baptist Church was founded as the Hewitt Avenue Mission in 1908 and was originally an outpost of Walmer Road Baptist Church. At the time, Roncesvalles was largely unpopulated, with the Eaton family home on Indian Road being one of the only residences in the area. The original building has been expanded several times, culminating in the construction of a unique circular sanctuary in 1927. High Park Baptist holds Sunday services, small group Bible studies in the church and local homes, and hosts &quot;Room To Roam&quot; a drop-in for parents and children in the neighbourhood, a popular food and clothing bank, summer day camps for local children, and more.

===Health===

The large St. Joseph&#x27;s Health Centre at Sunnyside and The Queensway in the south of the district has been on the site since the 1840s, being first the site of the Sisters of St. Joseph Order, then an orphanage and later the hospital. The Order still operates the hospital. It occupies the site of Sunnyside Lodge, a home of John Howard.

At the south end of Roncesvalles is Copernicus Lodge, a large chronic care and nursing home facility that primarily serves the Polish community although not exclusively. The Lodge is a monument to the community that in large part was responsible for its creation. It opened its first wing on Roncesvalles and later opened a new wing on Marion Street.

There are several doctor&#x27;s offices on Roncesvalles, and several are located in the Sunnyside Medical Arts Building at 27 Roncesvalles, including the St. Joseph&#x27;s Urban Family Health Team. The street has several drugstores.

===Education===
The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is an English secular public school board that serves the City of Toronto. The school board operates a number of institutions that provides primary and secondary. TDSB does not operate any secondary schools in the neighbourhood, although three TDSB secondary school located near the neighbourhood serve the students of Roncesvalles. They include Humberside Collegiate Institute, Parkdale Collegiate Institute, and Western Technical-Commercial School. Primary schools operated by TDSB in Roncesvalles include:
* Fern Avenue Public School is a public elementary school and middle school on Fern Avenue, east of Roncesvalles.
* Garden Avenue Junior Public School is a public elementary school on Garden Avenue west of Roncesvalles. It was founded in 1957 and was known as Argentina Junior P.S. between 1961 and 1982, but this was changed back to the original name during the Falklands conflict.
* Howard Junior Public School is a public elementary school on Marmaduke Street at Sunnyside Avenue.

The Toronto District Catholic School Board (TDCSB) is a public English separate school board that serves the City of Toronto. The school board operates institutions that provides primary and secondary education. Schools operated by TDCSB in Roncesvalles include:
* St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Elementary School is a Catholic elementary school on Fermanagh Avenue east of Roncesvalles. It was founded in 1914 operating out of a storefront on Roncesvalles Avenue, across the street from the church. With the end of the war in 1918, a separate building was constructed for the school behind the church on Westminster Ave., which was run by Sisters of Loreto. The school was extended to Fermanagh Avenue shortly after. Problems with low enrolment threatened the existence of the school which was considered for closure during a reorganization of the Metropolitan Separate School Board (which became the TCDSB) and general changes of demographics.
* Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School. The school is leased by the TCDSB.

Two public French-language secondary schools, École secondaire catholique Saint-Frère-André and École secondaire Toronto Ouest operate nearby on Lansdowne Avenue in the former West Toronto Collegiate building. They are operated by Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, and Conseil scolaire Viamonde respectively.

The High Park branch of the Toronto Public Library, a Carnegie library, is located at Wright Avenue. It was opened in 1916, and renovated in 1979 and again in 1991.

==Economy==
There are myriad small businesses, most of which are independently owned and operated. These include specialty gift shops, pharmacies, grocers (including organic specialty), health food stores, clothing and shoe boutiques, cafes and restaurants, book and music stores, video stores, art shops, hardware stores and law offices. The former S.S. Kresge store, now a Royal Bank, was built in 1936 and retains its original Kresge signage. The majority of shops are accommodated in two or three-storey structures built in the first half of the 20th century, with the retail portion on the ground floor and apartments above.

Roncesvalles is very well known for the large number of small restaurants, cafés and specialty food shops of various cuisines. There are several bakeries and delicatessens found along the full length of Roncesvalles.

The Roncesvalles Village Business Improvement Area district includes businesses along the full length of Roncesvalles from Dundas Street to Queen Street. The BIA was founded in 1985.

==Recreation==
The Roncesvalles area has several parks and sporting facilities. The schools of the neighbourhood also provide facilities, including swimming pools for school-age children. The largest park in the area is High Park west of Parkside Drive, with playgrounds, Grenadier Pond, a zoo, baseball diamonds, outdoor swimming pool and forest. Sorauren Avenue Park, was created at the intersection of Sorauren Avenue and Wabash Avenue on the site of a former bus garage. It now holds two tennis courts, two soccer fields and a fieldhouse. A playground is across Wabash from the park. At the site, a former linseed oil factory is now in the ownership of the City and is earmarked for a future recreation centre. To the south of the area, the Sunnyside lakefront provides playgrounds, picnic areas, the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion, a boardwalk, a recreation trail and beaches.

High Park provides baseball diamonds and organized youth baseball programs. High Park also has two soccer fields, tennis courts and an artificial ice rink in the winter. The École secondaire catholique Saint-Frère-André and École secondaire Toronto Ouest on Lansdowne Avenue to the east provide an all-weather track and a soccer field. The closest hockey arena is at McCormick, east of Lansdowne.

There are several club-run facilities. High Park Curling Club on Indian Road is Toronto&#x27;s oldest curling club. The current rink was opened in 1911. There are two tennis clubs in High Park. Along the lakefront, there are rowing clubs including the Argonaut Club. The Boulevard Club operates tennis and boating facilities.

==Transportation==
The intersection of Roncesvalles, Queen and King streets has long been a transportation hub of the city of Toronto. Passenger trains first served the area in 1855. In the 1890s the location became the hub of commuter streetcars going as far west as Port Credit. In 1895, Toronto Railway Company (forerunner of the TTC) built the Roncesvalles streetcar yards, which continue to dominate the northwest corner. The intersection itself is famous for its huge number of streetcar tracks, possibly the most numerous in the city. The area has also been home to two other TTC yards, one streetcar yard in the triangle formed by Howard Park Avenue, Dundas Street West and Ritchie Avenue, and the bus garage on Sorauren Ave on the current site of Sorauren Park. The Roncesvalles Carhouse, a streetcar maintenance and storage facility, is located within Roncesvalles.

Today, the area is well served by the Dundas West and Keele subway stations to the north at Bloor Street. The 501, 504A, 505, and 506 streetcars provide frequent service and the 80 Queensway bus provides service along Parkside Avenue from Keele station.

Roncesvalles Avenue was completely reconstructed in 2009–2011, partially owing to the need to replace the sewer pipes, water mains and the streetcar tracks. The roadway re-construction incorporated roadway narrowing and sidewalk improvements. Transit platforms were built to extend to the streetcar doors at transit stops. The transit platforms incorporated ramps to provide a bicycle lane. Sewers were rebuilt during 2009 and early 2010. The trees on the street, which were in planters, were replaced, and the new trees planted at ground level. The soil beneath the tree plantings was landscaped into trenches beneath the sidewalks.

GO Transit operates trains along the Lakeshore rail line, although no longer stopping at Sunnyside. The nearest stop is at Exhibition Place. There are GO trains operating along the CN/CP lines to the east, stopping at Bloor Street and Dundas Street West.

There once was an inter-city bus depot at the northwest corner of Roncesvalles and Queen, now converted to a fast-food restaurant. This took over from the commuter streetcars, although streetcars do travel as far west as Long Branch from Roncesvalles.

The former Toronto - Sunnyside passenger train station, providing intercity train connections, on the Great Western line opened in 1910 at the foot of Roncesvalles. It replaced the railway station located at Jameson and Springhurst, that opened in 1879. Sunnyside station shut in 1971 and was demolished in 1973.

<doc id="633822" wikidata="Q4335726" url="?curid=633822" title="Sarich orbital engine">
<text>The Sarich orbital engine is a type of internal combustion engine, invented in 1972 by Ralph Sarich, an engineer from Perth, Australia, which features orbital rather than reciprocating motion of its central piston. It differs from the conceptually similar Wankel engine by using a generally prismatic shaped piston that orbits the axis of the engine, without rotation, rather than the rotating trilobular rotor of the Wankel.

== Overview ==
The engine promised to be about one third the size and weight of conventional piston engines due to the compact arrangement of the combustion chambers. Another advantage is that there is no high-speed contact area with the engine walls, unlike in the Wankel engine in which edge wear is a problem. However, the combustion chambers are divided by vanes which do have contact with both the walls and the orbiting piston and are more difficult to seal due to the eight corners of the combustion chamber.

In the patent, the engine is described as two stroke internal combustion engine, but the patent claims that with a different valve mechanism it could be used as a four stroke engine. However most of the development work was done on four stroke versions with both poppet and disk valve arrangements. A supercharger is required if operated in two stroke mode since crankcase pumping can&#x27;t be used to charge the combustion chamber.

Interestingly, in his seminal book researching and documenting all the possible ways to create a rotary piston displacer, Felix Wankel shows the orbiting piston and reciprocating vane mechanism used in the orbital engine.

== Research and development ==
The Orbital Engine Company, with funding from partner BHP and Federal Government R&amp;D grants, worked on the concept from 1972 until 1983 and had a 3.5L four stroke engine performing as well as the similar petrol car engines of the day at typical road load conditions. A technical paper was presented to the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1982, and is now part of their historic transaction collection.

A major reason for the good performance of this engine was the development of a unique and patented injection system directed into the combustion chamber which created a stratified charge combustion process.

Several auto makers from around the world showed great interest in the engine, however it was realised that there was still at least $100 million of development work required to commercialise the engine and the funding sources decided this was not a sound investment. Instead it was realised the same injection and combustion system could be adapted onto existing two and four stroke petrol engines and this work become the future of the company, being called the Orbital Combustion Process.

During prototyping process, the engine has been installed in 3 vehicles: Toyota Kijang (3 cylinder unit), and Suzuki Karimun. (2 cylinder unit), installed by Sangeet Hari Kapoor when he was working in PT Wahana Perkasa Auto Jaya, which is a company under the Texmaco group. The 3 cylinder unit is also installed to 100 units of Ford Festivas in Australia, dubbed Festiva EcoSport, and the verdict is that while the car is somewhat more powerful than the Ford Festiva 1.3, it failed in to deliver emission compliance, efficiency, and NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) reduction at same time.

== Technical problems ==
The orbital engine has two of fundamental design issues, which also plague the Wankel engine:

# Large surface to volume ratio combustion chamber which leads to larger combustion chamber heat losses and so loss of power, which can be greatly reduced using stratified combustion;
# Long sealing paths and multiple corner seals which mean it is harder to contain the chamber gases and so there is some loss of pressure and thus power.

<doc id="633829" wikidata="Q6724445" url="?curid=633829" title="Mackeson Stout">
<text>Mackeson Stout is a milk stout first brewed in 1907. It contains lactose, a sugar derived from milk.

== Milk stout ==
Milk stout (also called sweet stout, mellow stout or cream stout) is a stout containing lactose, a sugar derived from milk. Lactose cannot be fermented by brewers&#x27; yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;), and the residue adds sweetness, body and calories to the finished beer. Mackeson still bears on its label the milk churn that has been its trademark since it was first brewed in 1907.

Milk stout was believed to be nutritious, and was recommended to nursing mothers. In 1875, John Henry Johnson first sought a patent for a milk beer, based on whey, lactose and hops.

== History ==
Mackeson&#x27;s Brewery of Hythe, Kent, first released the beer in 1909 to celebrate the 240th anniversary of brewing in Hythe. They patented it and licensed it to breweries across the country, so it quickly became a national brand and attracted numerous imitators. Whitbread acquired the brand in 1929. By the 1950s it accounted for half of Whitbread&#x27;s production, and was brewed at Chiswell Street in London, Stockport, Kirkstall and Hythe.

Brewing at the Hythe plant ended in 1968. The beer was then brewed at the Exchange Brewery in Sheffield. When that was closed in 1993, Whitbread moved production to their Castle Eden and Samlesbury plants. From May 1999, then Vaux brewery until production was contracted out to Young&#x27;s Brewery of Wandsworth. Whitbread was purchased in 2001 by Interbrew (now Anheuser-Busch InBev). Production was then moved to Camerons Brewery of Hartlepool, before moving to Hydes Brewery in Manchester until March 2012.

== Advertisements ==
A long-lasting television advertising campaign with the actor Bernard Miles contained the catch-phrase that Mackeson &quot;looks good, tastes good and, by golly, it does you good.&quot;

After its claimed health benefits were challenged, the slogan was shortened to &quot;It looks good, tastes good and by golly!&quot;

For some years, Mackeson has been a &#x27;ghost brand&#x27; in the UK; still produced and sold but without advertising or promotion.

== Versions ==
In 2012, its ABV was lowered from 3% to 2.8% in order to qualify for duty relief. It is available in 330 ml cans and 275 ml bottles.

A 4.9% Mackeson&#x27;s XXX is brewed by Carib Brewery in Trinidad for the local market where it is targeted at young men, with the advertising slogan &quot;king of the night&quot;. The Trinidadian version is a popular import into Hong Kong, and is among the top twenty highest-selling beers there, selling over 500,000 litres a year.

British-brewed Mackeson&#x27;s XXX was imported by a division of Hudepohl-Schoenling of Cincinnati for the US market. This division became Royal Imports after a restructuring in the late 1990s and for a brief while in the early 2000s Royal had the &quot;Triple Stout&quot; contracted brewed in the US, first at the former Hudepohl brewery now owned by Boston Beer Company and then at The Lion in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

<text>Dirty Pretty Things is a 2002 British social thriller film directed by Stephen Frears and written by Steven Knight. Following the lives of two immigrants in London, it was filmed in a documentary style and was produced by BBC Films and Celador Films, and distributed by Buena Vista International through Miramax Films.

==Plot==
Okwe, a doctor in his home country (not initially named) who was forced to flee after being falsely accused of murdering his wife, lives in the United Kingdom as an undocumented immigrant. He drives a cab in London during the day and works at the front desk of a hotel at night, which is staffed by other immigrants, both documented and undocumented. He is pressed into giving medical treatment to other poor immigrants, including fellow cab drivers with venereal diseases. He is supplied with antibiotics by his friend Guo Yi, an employee at a hospital mortuary.

Juliette, a sex worker who regularly conducts her business at the hotel, informs Okwe about a blocked toilet in one of the rooms, and he fishes out a human heart. The manager of the hotel, Juan, runs an illegal operation at the hotel wherein immigrants swap kidneys for forged passports. After learning of Okwe&#x27;s past as a doctor, Juan pressures him to join his operation as a surgeon, but Okwe refuses.

Senay is a Turkish Muslim seeking asylum who also works at the hotel as a cleaner. Her immigration status allows her to stay in the UK, provided she does not work; the hotel is a perfect cover because she is not named on its books. She allows Okwe to sleep on her sofa when she is not home, as she is from a conservative culture where men and women who are not married do not spend the night together under the same roof. After Senay is visited by Immigration Services, who inspect the hotel after finding a book of matches in her flat, Okwe prevents the officials from intercepting her.

No longer able to work at the hotel, Senay begins working in a sweatshop making clothes, which is also raided by officials looking for undocumented immigrants, who the manager gets rid of. The manager allows Senay to keep her job and not report her to the authorities in return for her performing oral sex on him; she initially complies before proceeding to bite him. Okwe finds her a place to stay at the hospital mortuary, while Senay asks him to accept Juan&#x27;s proposition in his organ business to raise money to travel to America.

In desperation, Senay offers her kidney to Juan for a passport; Juan accepts the deal on condition he takes her virginity as well. Senay is later provided with a morning-after pill by Juliette. After learning of Senay&#x27;s plan, Okwe agrees to perform the operation to ensure her safety, but only if Juan provides them both with passports under different names. After Juan delivers the passports, Okwe and Senay drug him, surgically remove his kidney, and sell it to Juan&#x27;s contact.

Okwe plans to use his new identity to return to his young daughter in Nigeria, and Senay plans to start a new life in New York. Before they part at Stansted Airport, they mouth the words &quot;I love you&quot; to each other, and she gives him her cousin&#x27;s address in New York. Senay boards her plane, and Okwe calls his daughter long-distance to tell her he is finally coming home.

== Cast ==
== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; received positive reviews. Metacritic gives it a rating of 78/100 based on reviews from 35 critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of based on reviews, and an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus describes the film as &quot;An illuminating and nuanced film about the exploitation of illegal immigrants.&quot; J. R. Jones of The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; described it as an &quot;impressive mix of entertainment and social comment, spinning a great mystery even as it confronts an ugly world&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a social thriller—a creepy, tightly knit suspense film that, on the fly, reveals more about the lives of immigrants in London than the most scrupulously earnest documentary&quot;. a sentiment echoed by the authors of &quot;Sociology: An Introductory Textbook and Reader&quot; of the film as being &quot;not a documentary but a social thriller which blends aspects of the global urban legends about child kidnapping for organs and prostitutes drugging unsuspecting barflies who wake up in a hotel bathtub minus a kidney&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and won a British Independent Film Award for Best Independent British Film in 2003. For his performance as Okwe, Chiwetel Ejiofor won the 2003 British Independent Film Award for Best Actor.

<text>A blood ritual is any ritual that involves the intentional release of blood.

== Description ==
Some blood rituals involve two or more parties cutting themselves or each other followed by the consumption of blood. The participants may regard the release or consumption of blood as producing energy useful as a sexual, healing, or mental stimulus. In other cases, blood is a primary component as the sacrifice, or material component for a spell. Blood rituals are practiced by various groups of people, including those with religious or political affiliations. Some of the rituals involving blood have been practiced for many centuries, and are still being practiced in the 21st century.

Blood rituals often involve a symbolic death and rebirth, as literal bodily birth involves bleeding. Blood is typically seen as very powerful, and sometimes as unclean. Blood sacrifice is sometimes considered by the practitioners of prayer, ritual magic, and spell casting to intensify the power of such activities.

==Aztecs==
The Aztecs participated in blood rituals around 500 years ago. The blood in the rituals has a symbolic meaning, depending on the group and ritual being performed. 

Around 1376 to 1521 AD, Aztecs used blood and sacrifice frequently as an offering to the Sun God. The Aztecs saw death as part of life, just like birth. They believed the gods sacrificed their own blood to create the universe, so in turn, the Aztecs offered blood to the Gods as a sort of reciprocal exchange and gift for their creations. Furthermore, the supply of ritual blood was believed to maintain plentiful fertile crops and aid in the continuation of the Aztec world. The author Jasmyne Pendragon, who has a bachelor of archaeology, stated in her article &quot;The Purpose of Aztec Blood Rituals Part 1&quot;, that &quot;The Aztecs lifestyles were governed by a need to supply fresh-blooded sacrificial victims to the sun god who required the hearts of men to give life to the world and assist the souls of dead warriors to the Aztecs version of heaven&quot;. The rituals maintained a relationship between Aztecs and their gods. The Aztecs believed the gods would provide plentiful crops and healthy long lives as long as blood was ritually given. If blood was not sacrificed to the gods, the humans believed they would be punished and endure excessive pain &quot;more violent than any man could ever do&quot;. 

==India==
Some Indians practice a political ritual voluntarily where the people donate blood as a way to remember politicians who have died. The blood donation is literally a donation to people who need transfusions The participants donate at donation camps during the birthday or the anniversary of the politician&#x27;s death. Jacob Copeman, a lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, states in his article &quot;Blood Will Have Blood: A Study in Indian Political Ritual&quot; that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi are the two politicians who are mainly &quot;remembered&quot; during the blood donations. These two politicians were assassinated and seen as dying for India, or important individuals who &quot;…shed their blood for the nation&quot;. According to Copeman, in a speech Indira Gandhi made in 1984, she &quot;…strikingly associated her blood with the health of the nation. Her blood would continue to nurture the nation even after her death…&quot;. The reason behind the donation is to keep life going or to give the individuals receiving the blood more time to live. The reason why the politicians are involved with this is because the donors are making a connection with the dead, symbolizing the blood being donated to the blood of the politician being honored. This is important because even though these people died, they are still helping preserve life, by the people of India donating blood in their honor.

== Other regions ==
Some radical movements among Shi’ite Muslims practiced a ritual called Matam in 2002 in Britain. However, this practice in popular culture of Shi&#x27;ite Muslim communities is considered excessive, violent, and wrong.

Body piercing can also be part of a blood ritual, as it can result in the release of blood. Piercing has been practiced in a number of indigenous cultures throughout the world, usually as a symbolic rite of passage, a symbolic death and rebirth, an initiation, or for reasons of magical protection.

A common blood ritual is the blood brother ritual, which began in ancient Europe and Asia. Two or more people, typically male, intermingle their blood in some way. This symbolically brings the participants together into one family. This can be an unsafe practice where blood-borne pathogens are concerned; the use of safe, sterilized equipment such as a lancet can mitigate this problem.

The Native American Sun Dance is usually accompanied by blood sacrifice.

== In the Bible ==
Blood rituals play a crucial role in the Bible, often symbolizing purification and the establishment of sacred covenants. One prominent example is found in Exodus 24:3-8, which describes a covenant ceremony between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai. The blood ritual described in this passage is a key example of the use and significance of blood in biblical tradition. The ritual involves the sacrifice of animals and the division of their blood into two halves, with one half sprinkled on the altar, representing God, and the other half sprinkled on the people.

Another example of a biblical blood ritual is found in John 6:54-57, in which John the Apostle recited the words of Jesus, highlighting the importance of the Eucharist for the sake of gaining eternal life. In this recitation, he explains that in order to gain everlasting life, his followers must eat his flesh and drink his blood. This was expanded upon in 1 Corinthians 10:16, in which the cup of blessing and bread are described as representations of the blood and body of Christ.

<doc id="633843" wikidata="Q812585" url="?curid=633843" title="Bayou">
<text>In usage in the Southern United States, a bayou () is a body of water typically found in a flat, low-lying area. It may refer to an extremely slow-moving stream, river (often with a poorly defined shoreline), marshy lake, wetland, or creek. They typically contain brackish water highly conducive to fish life and plankton. Bayous are commonly found in the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, especially in the Mississippi River Delta, though they also exist elsewhere.

A bayou is often an anabranch or minor braid of a braided channel that is slower than the mainstem, often becoming boggy and stagnant. Though fauna varies by region, many bayous are home to crawfish, certain species of shrimp, other shellfish, catfish, frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, American alligators, American crocodiles, herons, lizards, turtles, tortoises, spoonbills, snakes, and leeches, as well as many other species.

==Etymology==
The word entered American English via Louisiana French in Louisiana and is thought to originate from the Choctaw word &quot;bayuk&quot;, which means &quot;small stream&quot;. After first appearing in the 17th century, the term is found in 18th century accounts and maps, often as &quot;bayouc&quot; or &quot;bayouque&quot;, where it was eventually shortened to its current form. The first settlements of the Bayou Têche and other bayous were founded by the Louisiana Creoles, and the bayous are commonly associated with Creole and Cajun culture.

An alternative spelling, &quot;buyou&quot;, is also known to have been in use, as in &quot;Pine Buyou&quot;, used in a description by Congress in 1833 of Arkansas Territory. &quot;bye-you&quot; is the most common pronunciation, while a few use &quot;bye-oh&quot; , although that pronunciation is declining.
==Geography==
The term &quot;Bayou Country&quot; is most closely associated with Cajun and Creole cultural groups derived from French settlers and stretching along the Gulf Coast from Houston, Texas, to Mobile, Alabama, and picking back up in South Florida around the Everglades, with its center in New Orleans, Louisiana. The term may also be associated with the homelands of certain Choctaw tribal groups.

Houston has the nickname &quot;Bayou City&quot;.

== Environmental risks ==
Anthropogenic influences have damaged bayou ecosystems over the years. Bayous are susceptible to pollution such as runoff from nearby urban communities (which can result in eutrophication) and oil spills given their low-lying position in the watershed. Many bayous have been cleared away by human activity as well, with those in Louisiana having shrunk by 1,900 square miles (4,900 square kilometers) since the 1930s.

=== Agriculture ===
Farming activities introduce nutrients into bayou ecosystems. Row crop agricultural land use is common (75–86% of the bayou watershed) in Bayou watersheds given the unique physical characteristics like flat topography and alluvial soils. Agricultural activity results in byproducts of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers, which can drastically alter delicate balances in freshwater and marine ecosystems. A study conducted on 3 agricultural bayous in the lower Mississippi River Basin found that the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus to sample mesocosms affected the decomposition of maize crop and willow oak detritus. While both species showed an increase in decomposition rate after N and P nutrient enhancement, the maize crop broke down faster than the native willow oak. The maize crop also had a significantly faster microbial respiration rate. The changes in microbial respiration of a wetland system impacts its carbon exchange with the environment. Inhibiting a wetland&#x27;s ability to sequester carbon further damages the status of the wetland as a carbon sink. This poses larger-scale issues as it alters the exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere and environment.

The use of pesticides in agriculture poses further threats to bayou ecosystems. A study conducted on three bayous (Cow Oak, Howden, Roundaway) in the western Mississippi River watershed found that pesticides released into bayou sediments cause significant impairment of the amphipod &quot;Hyalella azteca&quot; both spatially and temporally. Despite being banned 40 years ago in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency, traces of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), once used in agriculture as an insecticide, were found in sediment and amphipod tissue. DDT is a probable carcinogen, and it has been linked to adverse health effects in both humans and wildlife.

=== Oil spills ===
Several oil spills have impacted bayou regions, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. This oil spill occurred off the Louisiana coast and resulted in the deaths of 11 people and the release of over 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean. The bayou wetlands of Bataria Bay, Louisiana experienced increased shoreline erosion as a direct result of the Deepwater horizon oil spill. This was determined by examining rates of wetland loss in the region from the year prior to the oil spill and contrasting that with the rates of wetland loss after the oil spill. The study noted significant land loss in regions not impacted by wave activity, further demonstrating that the land degradation was caused by oil rather than other sources of weathering from waves and cyclones.

Other notable oil spills affecting bayous include 4,000 U.S. gallons (about 15,141.65 L) of oil spilling in a lake near Bayou Sorrel in Louisiana and 20,000 U.S. gallons (about 75,708.24 L) of oil spilling into Saint Bernard Parish waters and the adjacent Bayou Bienvenue in Louisiana. Both incidents occurred in 2022. Oil spills harm bayous as oil is toxic to most animals. In vapor form, oil leads to lung, liver, and nervous system dysfunction if inhaled. Ingested oil poses threats to the digestive tract. Oil matts feathers and fur, resulting in disruptions in the animal&#x27;s ability to insulate themselves in colder temperatures. Matted bird feathers lose properties that aid in flying and swimming. Such disruptions in individual adaptive ability may lead to trophic cascades in a bayou community.  

=== Impervious surfaces ===
Human development activities, such as the increase of impervious surfaces, results in quicker, high intensity flood pulses, delivering larger quantities of these nutrients to the ecosystem at a much more rapid rate. Impervious surfaces include roads, housing developments, and parking lots that replace natural vegetation, typically associated with human development and urbanization. When impervious surfaces are installed, the layer of soil that stores water is damaged/removed, resulting in a lack of permeable surfaces to absorb rainfall and floodwater.

==== Heavy metal contamination ====
Bayous have experienced trends of land cover loss and conversion to impervious surfaces, of which has been associated with influxes of metals such as aluminum, copper, iron, lead, and zinc. Heavy metals in sediments and ultimately the waters of bayous bioaccumulates in organisms to spread their toxins throughout various trophic levels. This harms both the health of individuals in that ecosystem as well as the humans who would be ingesting fish and other aquatic organisms with potential metal contamination.
