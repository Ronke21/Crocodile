<text>Benjamin Helm Bristow (June 20, 1832 – June 22, 1896) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 30th U.S. Treasury Secretary and the first Solicitor General.

A Union military officer, Bristow was a Republican Party reformer and civil rights advocate. During his tenure as Secretary of the Treasury, he is primarily known for breaking up and prosecuting the Whiskey Ring at the behest of President Grant, a corrupt tax evasion profiteering ring that depleted the national treasury. Additionally, Bristow promoted gold standard currency rather than paper money. Bristow was one of Grant&#x27;s most popular Cabinet members among reformers. Bristow supported Grant&#x27;s Resumption of Specie Act of 1875, that helped stabilize the economy during the Panic of 1873. As the United States&#x27; first solicitor general, Bristow aided President Ulysses S. Grant and Attorney General Amos T. Akerman&#x27;s vigorous and thorough prosecution and destruction of the Ku Klux Klan in the Reconstructed South. Solicitor General Bristow advocated for African American citizens in Kentucky to be allowed to testify in a white man&#x27;s court case. He also advocated education for all races to be paid for by public funding.

A native of Kentucky, Bristow was the son of a prominent Whig Unionist and attorney. Having graduated from Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1851, Bristow studied law and passed the bar in 1853, working as an attorney until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Fighting for the Union, Bristow served in the army during the American Civil War and was promoted to colonel. Wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, Bristow recuperated and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1863, Bristow was elected Kentucky state Senator, serving only one term. At the end of the Civil War, Bristow was appointed assistant to the U.S. District Attorney serving in the Louisville area. In 1866, Bristow was appointed U.S. District attorney, serving in the Louisville area.

In 1870, Bristow was appointed the United States&#x27; first U.S. Solicitor General, who aided the U.S. Attorney General by arguing cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1874, Bristow was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President Ulysses S. Grant. Initially Grant gave Bristow his full support during Bristow&#x27;s popular prosecution of the Whiskey Ring. However, when Bristow and Grant&#x27;s Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont, another reforming Cabinet member, uncovered that Orville Babcock, Grant&#x27;s personal secretary, was involved in the ring, Grant&#x27;s relationship with Bristow cooled. In June 1876, due to friction over Bristow&#x27;s zealous prosecution of the Whiskey Ring and rumor that Bristow was interested in running for the U.S. presidency, Bristow resigned from President Grant&#x27;s Cabinet on his 44th birthday. During the 1876 United States presidential election, Bristow made an unsuccessful attempt at gaining the Republican presidential ticket, running as a Republican reformer. The Republicans, however, chose Rutherford B. Hayes. After the 1876 presidential election, Bristow returned to private practice in New York. He formed a successful law practice in 1878, often arguing cases before the U.S. Supreme Court until his death in 1896.

Bristow was credited, by historian Jean Edward Smith, as one of Grant&#x27;s best cabinet choices. Reformers were generally pleased by Secretary Bristow&#x27;s overall prosecution of the Whiskey Ring, and looked to him for cleaning up government corruption. Historians have also given credit for Bristow, America&#x27;s first Solicitor General, for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan. Bristow, however, had an ambitious, contentious nature, and at times this led to various feuds with Grant cabinet members. Bristow, a native of Kentucky, represented the Southern United States on Grant&#x27;s cabinet, during Grant&#x27;s second term.

==Early life==
Benjamin Helm Bristow was born in Edwards Hall on June 20, 1832, in Elkton, Kentucky, United States. Bristow was the son of Francis M. Bristow and his wife Emily Helm. Francis was a prominent lawyer and Whig member of Congress in 1854–1855 and 1859–1861. Edwards Hall was the home of his late grandfather, Benjamin Edwards. Bristow graduated at Jefferson College, Washington, Pennsylvania, in 1851, studied law under his father, and was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1853. For a while Bristow worked as a law partner for his father. His father later became a strong anti-slavery Unionist. His father&#x27;s political anti-slavery and Whig views strongly influenced Bristow&#x27;s own political outlook.

==Marriage and family==
On November 21, 1854, aged 22, Bristow married Abbie S. Briscoe. Benjamin and Abbie had two children one son, William A. Bristow, and one daughter Nannie Bristow. William was an attorney who worked in Bristow&#x27;s New York law firm &quot;Bristow, Opdyke, &amp; Willcox&quot;. In June 1896 William was in London recovering from typhoid fever. Nannie married Eben S. Sumner a Massachusetts textile businessman and politician.

==Kentucky law practice (1858–1861)==
In 1858, Bristow and his wife Abbie moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Bristow practiced law until the outbreak of the Civil War.

==American Civil War (1861–1863)==

In December 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, the South seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy (&quot;1861&quot;), primarily to protect the institution of slavery, profitable cotton plantations, and resistance to black integration and citizenship. President James Buchanan, sympathetic to the South, did virtually nothing to contain Southern secession, prior to Lincoln&#x27;s March 4, 1861, Inauguration. At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, Bristow, an ardent Unionist, joined the Union Army, and mustered the 25th Kentucky Infantry . On September 21, 1861, Bristow was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 25th Kentucky Infantry. Bristow fought under General Ulysses S. Grant and served bravely at three battles, Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and Shiloh, at the latter he was injured.

In April 1862, General Grant and most of his Union Army were encamped at Pittsburg Landing, and had planned to attack Corinth, a Confederate stronghold. The Confederates, however attacked in full force, that surprised Grant&#x27;s unentrenched Union Army. Grant and his men were able to hold off the Confederate Army, although one Union division was captured. The next day, after Grant received reinforcements, the Union Army attacked the Confederates in full force and pushed the Southern Army back to Corinth. At this two day Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, Bristow was severely wounded by an exploding shell over his head and temporarily forced to retire from field duty in order to recover from his injury. The force and noise of the explosion left Bristow deaf and unconscious, unable to command. Bristow was replaced by Major William B. Wall. After his recuperation, Bristow returned to field service during the summer of 1862 and helped recruit the 8th Kentucky Cavalry.

On September 8, 1862, Bristow was commissioned lieutenant colonel over the 8th Kentucky Cavalry. Bristow assumed command of the 8th Kentucky Cavalry in January 1863 after Col. James M. Shackleford, the previous commander, was promoted brigadier general. On April 1, 1863, Bristow was promoted to colonel and continued his command over the 8th Kentucky Cavalry. In July 1863 Col. Bristow and the Kentucky 8th Cavalry assisted in the capture of John Hunt Morgan during his July 1863 raid through Indiana and Ohio.

==Kentucky state senator (1863–1865)==
On September 23, 1863, Bristow was honorably discharged from service in the Union Army; having been elected Kentucky State Senator by Christian County. Bristow had not known he had been elected and served one term as State Senator until 1865, having resigned office. Bristow supported all Union war effort legislation, the presidential election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864, and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment that outlawed slavery.

==U.S. District Attorney (1866–1870) ==

In 1865, Bristow was appointed assistant to the United States Attorney. In 1866, Bristow was appointed district attorney for the Louisville, Kentucky district. As district attorney, he was renowned for his vigor in enforcing the 1866 U.S. Civil Rights Act. Bristow served as district attorney until 1870 and spent a few months practicing law in partnership with future United States Supreme Court Justice John Harlan.

==First U.S. Solicitor General (1870–1872)==
===Prosecuted Ku Klux Klan===

In 1870, Congress created the U.S. Department of Justice, in part, to aid in the enforcement of U.S. Congressional Reconstruction laws and U.S. Constitutional amendments. On October 4, 1870, Bristow was appointed the first incumbent U.S. Solicitor General by President Ulysses S. Grant and served until November 12, 1872, having resigned the office. Bristow and U.S. Attorney General Amos Akerman prosecuted thousands of Klansmen that resulted in a brief two-year quiet period during the turbulent Reconstruction Era in the South. In 1873 President Grant nominated him Attorney General of the United States in case then Attorney General George H. Williams was confirmed as Chief Justice of the United States, a contingency which did not arise.

===Feud with Akerman===
On the verge of prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan in mid-September 1871, Bristow in Washington launched a treacherous attack on his boss Akerman&#x27;s reputation, while Akerman was fighting lawlessness in the South. After Grant returned from a trip to Dayton, Ohio, Bristow, wanting Akerman&#x27;s cabinet post, told Grant that Akerman was &quot;too small&quot; for the job of Attorney General and he was not respected &quot;by the Court &amp; the profession generally&quot;. Bristow went so far as to call Akerman a &quot;dead weight on the administration&quot;. Grant was shocked at Bristow&#x27;s view of Akerman and surprised that Bristow had prodded Grant to get him fired by Grant. Grant refused to consider firing Akerman, telling Bristow that Akerman was thoroughly honest and an earnest man. Grant kept Akerman on the cabinet while Bristow retained his job of Solicitor General.

===Civil rights speech===
In 1871, Bristow traveled to his native Kentucky state and in a speech advocated African American civil rights. Bristow advocated that blacks be given the right to testify in juries. At this time Kentucky law forbade the 225,000 black U.S. citizens from testifying in any civil or criminal case involving a white man. He stated the Kentucky law that denied African Americans the right to testify in a white man&#x27;s case had roots in slavery and was a &quot;monstrous and grievous wrong to both races.&quot; Bristow stated that the Ku Klux Klan Act and the previous Civil Rights acts passed by the U.S. Congress were designed to protect the &quot;humblest citizens&quot; from lawbreakers. Bristow stated he would &quot;tax the rich man&#x27;s property to educate his poor neighbor&#x27;s child&quot;, and he would &quot;tax the white man&#x27;s property to educate the black man&#x27;s child.&quot; Bristow advocated free universal education and all property in Kentucky be taxed to pay for schools.

==Secretary of the Treasury (1874–1876)==
On June 3, 1874, President Grant appointed Bristow Secretary of the Treasury after William A. Richardson was removed in light of the Sanborn incident that involved Treasury contract scandals. Bristow was hailed by the press as a much needed reformer. Bristow took control of the Treasury during the Long Depression, that was started by the Panic of 1873. The Republican Party at this time was divided over currency. Bristow supported the hard money North Eastern Republicans and favored a resumption of species (coin money) to replace greenbacks (paper money). President Grant had vetoed the &quot;Inflation Bill&quot;, on April 22, that would have increased paper money into the collapsed economy. Bristow&#x27;s support of Grant&#x27;s veto helped him get nominated for the Treasury by Grant. Sixteen days after Bristow took office, on June 20, Bristow&#x27;s 42nd birthday, Grant signed a compromise act that legalized $26 million greenbacks released by previous Treasury Secretary Richardson, allowed a maximum of $382 million greenbacks, and authorized a redistribution of $55 million national banknotes. The act had little affect to alleve the devastated economy.

===Internal reforms made===
Fulfilling the press&#x27;s reformer expectation, Bristow immediately went to work. He drastically reorganized the Treasury Department, abolished the corrupt office of supervising architect made famous by Alfred B. Mullett, and dismissed the second-comptroller and his subordinates for inefficiency. Bristow shook up the detective force and consolidated collection districts in the Customs and Internal Revenue Services. He dismissed over 700 people and implemented civil service rules in the Treasury Department.

===Feud with Robeson===
Within a few months after Grant appointed Bristow to run the Treasury, Bristow developed a feud with Grant&#x27;s appointed Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson. The controversy centered around Robeson wanting to have Senator A.G. Cattell appointed financial agent in London to negotiate a bond issue. Cattell had performed a similar service in 1873 under previous Secretary Richardson. Bristow refused to make the appointment and believed a Treasury appointee could do the job. Bristow lobbied Grant to appoint John Bigelow, head of the Treasury Department&#x27;s Loan Division. Grant accepted Bristow&#x27;s choice of Bigelow, but he warned Bristow that Bigelow had a previous episode of drunkness. Bristow went further to undercut Robeson&#x27;s influence in the Grant cabinet. Bristow told Grant that Robeson&#x27;s Navy Department was financially mismanaged, and was under the control of former treasury secretary Hugh McCulloch&#x27;s banking house. Bristow&#x27;s advisers told Bristow to cool things off, and take a less confrontational approach.

===Feud with Williams===
Grant&#x27;s appointed Attorney General George Williams position on the cabinet was not secure, after Williams nomination was withdrawn by Grant for Supreme Court Justice. His personal reputation and that of his wife, Kate Williams, was under public scrutiny. To defend her husband and herself, Kate sent out anonymous letters to slander Grant&#x27;s cabinet, and others, including alleging sexual misconduct. Cabinet members who had received letters included Secretary of War William Belknap and Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson. Treasury department solicitor, Bluford Wilson, hired H.C. Whitely to investigate Kate and the letters. Wilson, Belknap, and Robeson agreed that Williams had to go. Bristow, supporting Wilson, urged Grant to fire Williams. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish told Grant that Kate had received a bribe of $30,000 from &quot;Pratt &amp; Boyd&quot; for the Justice Department to drop a case against the company. Grant finally fired Williams, and replaced him with New York reformer Edwards Pierrepont, who cleaned up the Department of Justice.

===Feud with Delano===

Columbus Delano was Grant&#x27;s Secretary of Interior, who allowed corruption in the vast Interior Department. Bristow, a reformer, wanted Delano out of office, believing Delano&#x27;s departure would establish integrity in the Republican Party. Also, Bristow believed Delano was plotting to remove Bristow from the Interior. Bristow called Delano a &quot;very mean dog&quot; and said Delano deserved the &quot;execration of every honest man.&quot; Bristow hired Frank Wolcott to investigate Delano&#x27;s department, that was ripe with corruption. Wolcott discovered that surveyor general of Wyoming, Silas Reed, had been making contracts with corrupt surveyors who shared enormous profits with silent-partners.

One of those silent-partners was Delano&#x27;s son John, who had no survey training or work experience. Wolcott sent Bristow damaging evidence against Delano, while Bristow shrewdly turned the documents over to Grant. Although the silent-partner contracts were technically legal, the scandal would embolden the Democrats. By April 1875, Delano had to go, but Grant delayed his resignation for several months. Delano fought back, by revealing information that other cabinet officers wanted Delano to stay in office, in addition to having made a false charge against Bristow. In October 1875, Grant finally replaced Delano with reformer Zachariah Chandler, who cleaned up corruption in the Interior Department.

===Broke the Whiskey Ring ===

In the Spring of 1875, Bristow began an anti-corruption campaign that would put him in the national spotlight. Bristow&#x27;s greatest work in the Treasury Department came in prosecution and break up of the notorious Whiskey Ring headquartered in St. Louis The Whiskey Ring was powerful and corrupt machine started by western distillers and their allies in the Internal Revenue Service; it profiteered by evading the collection of taxes on whiskey production. Distillers tended to bribe revenue agents, rather than pay excessive levies on alcohol. Past efforts to uncover the Whiskey Ring were unsuccessful, because ring members in Washington D.C. alerted other ring members of pending investigations. A November 1872 investigation, by three revenue investigators, into St. Louis distilleries, had found significant irregularities, but one agent who was bribed, submitted a whitewashed version of corruption. Despite Washington rumors of its existence, the ring seemed to be impregnable to prosecution.

====Investigation====
In the Fall of 1874 Bristow received a $125,000 (~$ in ) appropriation from Congress to investigate the Whiskey Ring. In December 1874, Bristow convinced Internal Revenue Supervisor J.W. Douglas to send a new investigation team, but Grant&#x27;s private Secretary at the White House, Orville E. Babcock, convinced Douglas to revoke his order. An effort to transfer revenue supervisors, proposed by Douglas, to new locations, to dismantle the ring, was defeated when, out of political objection, Grant suspended the order on February 4, 1875. Grant desired to &quot;detect frauds&quot; that had already been committed by the Whiskey Ring, rather than transfer the supervisors. Bristow, and Grant appointed Treasury Solicitor Bluford Wilson, lost faith in Douglas&#x27; willingness to go after the ring, and launched a covert investigation by independent undercover investigators, suggested by revenue agent Homer Yaryan.

Political journalist, George W. Fishback, owner of the &quot;St. Louis Democrat&quot; advised Bristow and Wilson, on how to expose the ring and to bypass any corrupt federal appointees who would tip other ring partners of a federal investigation. Washington correspondent, Henry V. Boynton, also aided Bristow and Wilson in their investigation. Monitored by Wilson, incorruptible investigative agents, that included Yaryan, obtained a vast supply of evidence in St. Louis of frauds committed by the ring. Bristow, in order to secure the enormity of the Whiskey Ring corruption, audited railroad and steamboat cargo receipts for accurate figures of the shipment of liquor in St. Louis and other key cities. To keep the investigation secret from the ring, Bristow gave the agents a cipher different from the Treasury code, while messages were relayed through Fishback and Boynton. Similar investigative work was done in Chicago and Milwaukee. Evidence of fraudulent activity was quickly obtained, into a profiteering scheme, that involved corrupt distillers and revenue agents. To escape taxes, the Whiskey Ring shipped whiskey labelled vinegar, listed whiskey at a lower proof, or illegally used revenue stamps multiple times. As a result, millions of dollars were depleted from the treasury in tax revenues.

Bristow&#x27;s investigation revealed that Grant appointment, General John McDonald, St. Louis Collector of Internal Revenue, who controlled seven states, was the ring leader. In April 1875, McDonald was called to Bristow&#x27;s Washington office and confronted by Bristow and showed massive evidence against McDonald, who confessed to being the ring leader. However, after McDonald left Bristow&#x27;s office, knowing he would be indicted, he unsuccessfully asked Wilson for indemnity from prosecution, and that the corrupt distilleries not be raided. McDonald pleaded that prosecution of the Whiskey Ring would hurt the Republican Party in Missouri. Wilson said later that he would have had McDonald fired on the spot, had he had the authority to do so.

====Prosecution====
On May 7, 1875, Bristow gave Grant the investigation findings of corruption by the Whiskey Ring and stressed the need for immediate prosecution. Without hesitation Grant gave Bristow permission to go after the ring, and told Bristow to move relentlessly against all those who were culpable. Three days later, on May 10, Bristow struck hard shattering the ring at one blow. Treasury agents raided and shut down distilleries, rectifying houses, and bottling plants in St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and six other Mid-Western states. Internal Revenue offices were placed under custody of the Treasury, while thirty-two installations were taken over. Books, papers, and tax receipts were confiscated, that proved and identified individual ring members guilt. Overwhelming evidence against the ring was collected, while federal grand juries produced over 350 indictments.

A Republican Party patronage boss in Wisconsin was linked to corruption found in Milwaukee. Evidence suggested almost every Republican office holder in Chicago profited from illegal distilling. St. Louis proved to be the kingpin city of the Whiskey Ring. In the past six months, $1,650,000 in taxes was evaded, while over two years the tax evasion number reached $4,000,000. Bristow instituted almost 250 federal civil and criminal lawsuits against ring members, and within a year, Bristow, recovered $3,150,000 in unpaid taxes, and obtained 110 convictions on 176 indicted ring members. Chief clerk of the Treasury, Willam Avery, St. Louis revenue collector General John McDonald, and St. Louis deputy collector, John A. Joyce, were indicted and convicted.

====Babcock&#x27;s St. Louis trial====

Bristow&#x27;s investigation extended into the White House, as evidence suggested Grant&#x27;s private Secretary, Orville E. Babcock, was a secret and paid informer of the Whiskey Ring. Bristow found two incriminating and cryptic letters signed &quot;Sylph&quot;, believed to have been Babcock&#x27;s handwriting. The first was dated December 10, 1874, that said, &quot;&quot;I have succeeded. They will not go. I will write you.&quot; The other letter was dated February 3, 1875, that said, &quot;We have official information that the enemy weakens. Push things.&quot;&quot; In October 1875, Bristow brought the two letters to Grant&#x27;s cabinet meeting. Babcock was brought in and confronted by both Bristow and Grant&#x27;s Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont. Babcock said that the messages had to do with the building of the St. Louis Eads Bridge and Missouri politics. Grant accepted Babcock&#x27;s explanation over the letters. In December 1875, nonetheless, Babcock was formerly indicted in the Whiskey Ring and his trial was set for February 1876 in St. Louis. During the trial President Grant, who believed Babcock was innocent, took a deposition at the White House that defended Babcock, and it was read to the jury in St. Louis. Babcock was acquitted by the jury and he returned to Washington, D.C.

===Resignation===
In the aftermath of the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, including Babcock&#x27;s trial, and an upcoming 1876 presidential election, Bristow&#x27;s position on Grant&#x27;s cabinet became untenable. Grant was grieved at Bristow&#x27;s prosecution of Babcock, whom Grant maintained was innocent. Also, rumors swirled that Bristow prosecuted the Whiskey Ring, to get the Republican nomination, that caused Grant to feel betrayed by Bristow. Largely owing to friction between himself and the president, Bristow resigned his portfolio in June 1876; as Secretary of the Treasury he advocated the resumption of specie payments and at least a partial retirement of &quot;greenbacks&quot;; and he was also an advocate of civil service reform. With his resignation, unlike other Grant appointed cabinet members, such as Ebenezer R. Hoar (&quot;Attorney General&quot;), Amos T. Akerman (&quot;Attorney General&quot;), and Marshall Jewell (&quot;Postmaster General&quot;), Bristow avoided the harsher reality of direct dismissal by Grant.

==Presidential run (1876)==

Bristow was a prominent reforming candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1876 (see U.S. presidential election, 1876). He was defeated at the Republican convention; Rutherford B. Hayes received the nomination. During the 1876 Republican Presidential Convention, Stalwart members of the Republican party, friends of President Grant, believed Bristow had been disloyal to Grant during the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, by going after Babcock. Rumor spread that Bristow had prosecuted the Whiskey Ring in an attempt to gain the 1876 Presidential Republican nomination. Bristow, however, proved to be a loyal statesman and had desired to keep President Grant and the nation from scandal. When Sec. Bristow testified in front of a congressional committee on the Whiskey Ring, he would not give any specific information regarding his conversations with President Grant, having claimed executive privilege.

The 1876 Republican National Convention, was held at Exposition Hall, in Cincinnati, Ohio. On the first Presidential Ballot, Bristow was third, at 113 votes, while James G. Blaine received 285 votes, followed by Oliver P. Morton, at 124 votes. On the fourth Presidential Ballot, Bristow finished second, at 126 votes, his highest number, while Blaine was first, at 292 votes. On the seventh and final Presidential Ballot, Bristow received only 21 votes. Rutherford B. Hayes, was elected the Republican presidential candidate, at 384 votes. Blaine finished a close second at 351 votes.

==New York attorney==

Bristow was upset over not winning the Republican presidential nomination and over the rumor he had been disloyal to President Grant. Bristow retired from politics, never again to run for political office. After 1878, he practiced law in New York City and on October 16, aged 46, he established the law partnership of &quot;Bristow, Peet, Burnett, &amp; Opdyke.&quot; Bristow was a prominent leader of the Eastern bar and was elected the second president of the American Bar Association in 1879. Having remained an advocate of civil service reform, Bristow was vice president of the &quot;Civil Service Reform Association&quot;. Bristow often ably argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Death and burial==
In 1896, Bristow suffered appendicitis and died at his home in New York City on June 22, just two days after his 64th birthday. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York.

==Historical reputation==
Historians primarily admire Bristow&#x27;s prosecution and shutting down the Whiskey Ring during his term as Grant&#x27;s Secretary of Treasury. Although a lawyer by trade and having no financial training, he was able to rid the Internal Revenue Department of corruption. Bristow demonstrated his ability and in striking down the Whiskey Ring that was supported by powerful political forces. Bristow&#x27;s zeal for reform, while he was Grant&#x27;s appointed Secretary of Treasury, was in part motivated by a sincere belief to clean up the Republican Party from corruption, and in part, an ambition to run for the presidency, and be nominated on the 1876 Republican presidential ticket. His prosecutions offended the social and political Republican Party stalwarts who supported patronage, forcing him out of office. As the first Solicitor General Bristow aided in prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan that enabled African Americans in the South to vote freely without fear of violent retaliation. He was born a Southerner in Kentucky, but he lived the remaining years of his life in New York.

Historian Jean Edward Smith said Bristow&#x27;s appointment to Secretary of Treasury was &quot;one of Grant&#x27;s best.&quot; Smith said Bristow &quot;brought a reforming zeal to the Grant administration, reinforced by a heady dose of ambition that was not out of place for a man in his early forties.&quot;

Historian Charles W. Calhoun, had a less positive view of Bristow. Calhoun said Bristow was &quot;ambitious&quot; and had a &quot;contentious nature&quot;.

Historian Ronald C. White said Bristow, as Secretary of Treasury, &quot;brought honesty to the position&quot;.

Historian Ron Chernow said Bristow was &quot;honest and competent&quot;, and: &quot;A zealous advocate of civil service reform&quot;.
Historian William S. McFeely said Grant&#x27;s appointment of Bristow to run the Treasury was &quot;reluctant&quot;, and &quot;the department passed into the impeccably clean hands of Benjamin Bristow, a sound money man.&quot;

<text>Burrell Carver Smith (born December 16, 1955) is a retired American computer engineer who created the first wire wrap prototype of the motherboard for the original Macintosh at Apple Computer. He became Apple employee #282 in February 1979 as an Apple II service technician. He designed the motherboard for Apple&#x27;s LaserWriter.

Smith was working in Apple&#x27;s service department when he helped Bill Atkinson add more memory to an Apple II computer in an innovative fashion. Atkinson recommended him to Jef Raskin, who, along with Steve Wozniak, was looking for a hardware engineer for their newly formed Macintosh project. As a member of the design team, Smith prototyped five different motherboards using techniques based on Programmable Array Logic (PAL) chips to achieve maximum functionality with a minimal chip count and cost. His signature is molded into the original Macintosh case, along with the signatures of the rest of the Macintosh team.

Smith left the company before the release of Apple&#x27;s Turbo Mac design platform, with an internal hard drive and a further simplified chipset.

He co-founded Radius Inc.

==Personal life==
Smith is retired and lives in Palo Alto.

He reportedly had bipolar disorder during the 1990s. In 1993, he was accused of &quot;breaking windows, throwing a firecracker and leaving letters at the house&quot; of Steve Jobs and the case was dropped when he accepted treatment. Actor Lenny Jacobson portrayed him in the 2013 film &quot;Jobs&quot;.

<text>Barbeau Peak is a mountain in Qikiqtaaluk, Nunavut, Canada. Located on Ellesmere Island within Quttinirpaaq National Park, it is the highest mountain in Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic. The mountain was named in 1969 after Marius Barbeau, a Canadian anthropologist whose research into First Nations and Inuit cultures gained him international acclaim.

Barbeau Peak is characterized by deep and long crevasses, razor thin ridges and highly variable and volatile weather.

Barbeau Peak is the highest mountain within the British Empire Range as well as the Arctic Cordillera, as well as in all of eastern North America.

Barbeau Peak was first climbed on 7 June 1967 by British geologist/glaciologist Geoffrey Hattersley-Smith as part of a joint Defence Research Board/Royal Air Force field party. The party both named the peak and determined its height.

The second ascent was by an eight-man American team in June 1982 (Errington, Trafton AAC 1983) via the north ridge. Subsequent ascents were made in 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2002, though as of 2006 only seven successful summits have been attained.

<text>The Indianapolis Indians are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League (IL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. They are located in Indianapolis, Indiana, and play their home games at Victory Field, which opened in 1996. The Indians previously played at Owen J. Bush Stadium from 1931 to 1996 and at two versions of Washington Park from 1902 to 1931.

Indianapolis is the second-oldest minor league franchise in American professional baseball (after the Rochester Red Wings). The team originated in 1902 as members of the American Association (AA), which was an independent league at the time but was granted Class A status in 1903. Since then, the Indians have played at the highest level of Minor League Baseball, though the terminology has changed. Indianapolis remained in the AA until the league disbanded after the 1962 season. They were briefly members of the International League (1963) and Pacific Coast League (1964–1968) before returning to the revived American Association in 1969. When the league dissolved a second time after the 1997 season, the Indians rejoined the IL in 1998. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of the minors in 2021, they were shifted to the Triple-A East, but this was renamed the International League in 2022.

Indianapolis has won 14 league championships. They were American Association champions twelve times (1902, 1908, 1917, 1928, 1949, 1956, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1994). The Indians have won the International League championship twice (1963 and 2000). They have also won two Little World Series (1917 and 1928), two Junior World Series (1949 and 1956), two Triple-A Classics (1988 and 1989), and one Triple-A World Series (2000).

==History==

===Prior professional baseball in Indianapolis===

Indianapolis has been home to professional baseball teams since the late 19th century. The city&#x27;s first Minor League Baseball team was the Indianapolis Blues, who played in the League Alliance in 1877. They joined the major league ranks in 1878 as members of the National League. After a five-year hiatus, they were followed by several teams called the Indianapolis Hoosiers. The first Hoosiers played in the major league American Association in 1884. The second Hoosiers were members of the minor Western League in 1885. The third Hoosiers were part of the National League from 1887 to 1889. Other minor league Hoosiers played in the Western League/minor American League in 1892 and from 1894 to 1900 and in the Western Association in 1901.

===American Association (1902–1962)===
In 1902, Bill Watkins and Charles Ruschaupt established the Indianapolis Indians as charter members of a new minor league American Association (AA). The league was an independent or &quot;outlaw league&quot; outside the umbrella of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. The circuit was granted Class A status, the highest level of the minors, in 1903. Since then, the Indians have remained at the top level of Minor League Baseball, though the terminology has changed: Class A (1903–1911), Double-A (1912–1945), and Triple-A (since 1946). The Indians&#x27; first home ballpark was East Washington Park.

The 1902 Indians, managed by Watkins, won the first American Association championship with a 96–45 record, two games ahead of the second-place Louisville Colonels. The team was ranked as the 27th greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians in 2001.

Ruschaupt became the principal owner in 1904, and Indianapolis began playing at West Washington Park in 1905. The Indians won their next AA pennant in 1908 with a 92–61 season, four games ahead of Louisville, under manager Charlie Carr. Sol Meyer and Sol Kiser purchased the team in 1913 but sold the team to James C. McGill and William G. Smith Sr. in 1914. McGill became the principal owner in 1917 and Smith in 1921.

Led by Jack Hendricks, the 1917 Indians won a third AA title with a 90–63 season, which placed them two-and-a-half games ahead of Louisville and the St. Paul Saints. The pennant win qualified Indianapolis for the Little World Series against the champions of the International League, the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Indians won the best-of-seven series, 4–1.

James A. Perry purchased the club in 1927. He died in a plane crash two years later, and his brother, Norman Perry, assumed ownership in 1929. Late in the 1931 season, the team moved to Perry Stadium, which was renamed Victory Field in 1942 and Bush Stadium in 1967. The 1928 Indians, who were managed by Bruno Betzel, won a fourth AA pennant by finishing two-and-a-half games ahead of the Minneapolis Millers at 99–68. They then defeated the Rochester Red Wings, 5–1, in the Little World Series.

From 1936 to 1946, Indianapolis qualified for the American Association playoffs on six occasions, but failed to win a championship. Meanwhile, Frank E. McKinney and Owen J. &quot;Donie&quot; Bush purchased the team in December 1941. The Indians entered into their first major league affiliation in 1939 and 1940 as the top farm club of the Cincinnati Reds. They returned to being an unaffiliated team from 1942 to 1945 before affiliating with the Boston Braves in 1946.

Indianapolis became the Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1947. The 1948 Indians posted a 100–54 record, a franchise high, but were eliminated in the playoff semifinals by St. Paul. The team was ranked as the 85th greatest minor league team in a 2001 ranking. Al López, who had managed the 1948 club, led the 1949 Indians back to the playoffs. They defeated Minneapolis, 4–3, in the semifinals and the Milwaukee Brewers, 4–3, in the final round, to win their first playoff title and fifth AA championship. In the Junior World Series, a successor to the Little World Series, Indianapolis defeated the Montreal Royals, 4–2. They made one more playoff appearance as a Pirates farm club in 1950 but lost in the championship finals.

The Cleveland Indians purchased the team in 1952, and made them their Triple-A affiliate. Over the five-year relationship, Indianapolis qualified for the playoffs three times. They lost in the semifinals in 1953, lost the 1954 finals, and won the American Association championship in 1956. On the heels of a 92–62 campaign, manager Kerby Farrell&#x27;s Indians defeated Minneapolis, 4–3, in the semifinals before winning their sixth AA title over the Denver Bears, 4–0. They capped off the season by sweeping Rochester, 4–0, to win the Junior World Series.

Having incurred significant financial losses, Cleveland elected to sell the team after the 1955 season. The Indianapolis community rallied to save the Indians by purchasing 20,182 shares of stock valued at $10 each, which allowed Indians, Inc., to purchase the club in December. The affiliation between the major and minor league Indians remained intact until the teams parted ways after the 1956 season.

Indianapolis held a three-year affiliation with the Chicago White Sox from 1957 to 1959, with their only winning season occurring in the final season. This was followed by even shorter stints as the Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1960 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1961. The 1961 team qualified for the playoffs but were ousted in the semifinals. The Indians rejoined the Chicago White Sox organization in 1962 and experienced another semifinal playoff exit in the first year of the affiliation. The American Association disbanded after the 1962 season.

===International League (1963)===

The Indians became members of the Triple-A International League (IL) in 1963 and retained their affiliation with the White Sox. Led by Rollie Hemsley, the 1963 Indians clinched the Southern Division title with an 86–67 record. They defeated the Syracuse Chiefs, 4–1, in the playoff semifinals before winning the International League championship over the Atlanta Crackers, 4–2. With the addition of Indianapolis and the Little Rock Travelers to the IL, the westernmost teams in the loop, team travel costs increased. At the 1963 Winter Meetings, major league teams refused to continue paying to defray these additional costs, so Indianapolis and Little Rock were expelled from the league.

===Pacific Coast League (1964–1968)===

The Pacific Coast League welcomed Indianapolis and Little Rock as members in 1964. Though they became the easternmost teams in the league, its two-division alignment helped to keep travel costs down. The Indians continued to serve as the top farm club of the Chicago White Sox through 1967, but they were unable to return to the postseason during the affiliation. They became part of the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; organization for a third time in 1968.

===American Association (1969–1997)===

The American Association was revived in 1969, and the Indians rejoined the league as the Triple-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. Through 1982, the team qualified for the AA playoffs on three occasions via winning Eastern Division titles. They lost the 1971 league title in a best-of-seven series to the Denver Bears, 4–3. The 1974 championship series also went the full seven games with Indianapolis losing to the Tulsa Oilers. The 1978 team was denied a championship, losing to the Omaha Royals, 4–1. George Scherger managed the 1982 Indians to a fourth Eastern Division title as a Reds affiliate with a 75–61 campaign. They then defeated Omaha, 4–2, for the AA championship.

Indianapolis became part of the Montreal Expos organization in 1984 in what would become one of the most successful periods in team history. Though they were eliminated in the semifinals in 1984, the Indians won four consecutive American Association championships from 1986 to 1989. Manager Joe Sparks was at the helm for the first three of these titles. The 1986 Indians won the division with an 80–62 record. They won the AA championship versus the Denver Zephyrs, 4–3. The 1987 team placed second in the division, which gave them for a playoff berth. They beat the Louisville Redbirds, 3–2, in the semifinals and then won another league championship over Denver, 4–1. Sparks led the 1988 Indians to the Eastern Division title on a 89–53 season. In a single round of playoffs, they defeated Omaha, 3–1, for the league crown. From 1988 to 1991, American Association teams participated in interleague play with teams from the International League in a partnership called the Triple-A Alliance, and the season culminated in the Triple-A Classic, a best-of-seven postseason championship between the leagues&#x27; champions. Indianapolis won the first of these against Rochester, 4–2. Manager Tom Runnells&#x27; 1989 team ended the season with an 87–59 record and the Eastern Division title. They defeated Omaha, 3–2, for their fourth consecutive American Association championship. In the Triple-A Classic, the Indians swept the Richmond Braves, 4–0.

Indianapolis affiliated with Cincinnati for the fourth time in 1993. In 1994, Marc Bombard managed the team to a first-place 86–57 mark. They won the semifinals over Louisville, 3–0, and bested the Nashville Sounds, 3–1, for another league championship. The Indians made return trips to the postseason over the next three years but suffered semifinal eliminations in 1995 and 1997 and a finals loss in 1996. After 66 seasons at Bush Stadium, the Indians left the ballpark for the new $20-million Victory Field in downtown Indianapolis&#x27; White River State Park on July 11, 1996.

===International League (1998–present)===
The American Association disbanded after the 1997 season, and its teams were absorbed by the two remaining Triple-A leagues—the International League (IL) and Pacific Coast League. Indianapolis returned to the IL, of which they had previously been members in 1963. They remained as affiliates of the Cincinnati Reds through 1999.

In 2000, the team entered into a new partnership with the Milwaukee Brewers. Steve Smith led the 2000 Indians to the Western Division title with an 81–63 record. They defeated the Durham Bulls, 3–2, in the semifinals before winning the International League championship versus the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, 3–2. The Indians met the Memphis Redbirds, champions of the Pacific Coast League in the Triple-A World Series, winning 3–1. Sub-.500 finishes during the next four seasons kept the team from returning to the postseason as a Brewers affiliate and prompted the team to end their affiliation with Milwaukee.

The Indians became the Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2005 after having previously been in their farm system in 1951. They qualified for the IL playoffs with a wild card berth, advanced to the finals by defeating the Buffalo Bisons, 3–2, but lost the championship to the Toledo Mud Hens, 3–0. the 2016 team finished the season tied for first-place in the Western Division with Toledo. On September 5, the Indians lost a one-game playoff against the Mud Hens for the division title, 4–0, which eliminated them from postseason contention. Indianapolis won back-to-back Western Division titles in 2012 and 2013 but lost in the semifinal round each time.

At the end of the 2015 season, Indianapolis was tied with the Columbus Clippers for first. Per the league&#x27;s playoff procedures, the teams were declared co-champions of the Western Division, and the Indians lost the tiebreaker to be seeded as the wild card team. The won their semifinals series against the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, 3–0, but lost the IL title versus Columbus Clippers, 3–2. They returned to the postseason in 2017 as Western Division champions but were eliminated in the semifinals by Durham, 3–1. The Indians did not qualify for the postseason from 2018 to 2019. The start of the 2020 season was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled altogether.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Indians were placed in the Triple-A East. They also extended their Professional Development License with Pittsburgh through 2030. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. Indianapolis ended the season in 11th place with a 57–62 record. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Indianapolis finished the tournament tied for 18th place with a 4–5 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Name controversy==
In July 2020, a year before Major League Baseball&#x27;s similarly-named Cleveland Indians changed their name to the &quot;Guardians&quot; in 2021 (which took effect in the 2022 MLB season), Indianapolis management said it would form a committee to determine whether a change was necessary, based on dialogue with local organizations and community members. By the time Cleveland changed their name in July 2021, Indianapolis announced that they had no immediate plans for a name change. Although they acknowledged that, when the team was initially formed, the name was a play on Indianapolis itself, the moniker had evolved to include more Native American references in their logo and marketing. Meanwhile, the primary newspaper covering the team, the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot;, started to report stories and results about the team using only the city&#x27;s name, without the supposedly controversial nickname. In addition, Carolina Castoreno-Santana, executive director of the American Indian Center of Indiana, said the Indianapolis Indians should change their name, arguing that the indigenous people were &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; in favor of changing the name. In February 2023, it was announced that the Indianapolis Indians would retain their long-held nickname and partner with local Indian tribes (the Miami Nation of Indiana). “We are grateful to the Indianapolis Indians for the opportunity to share our story with Hoosiers throughout central Indiana,” said Brian Buchanan, chief of the Miami Nation of Indians. “When the history of Indiana is studied, the major influence of Native American people is seen in the names of Indiana cities, state parks, rivers, food, celebrations and other cultural points of interest.”

<text>The National League North, officially known as Vanarama National League North for sponsorship reasons, is a professional Association football league in England. National League North is the second division of the National Leagues and step 2 of the NLS and sixth-highest tier overall in the English football league system, after the Premier League, the EFL leagues and the National League and is contested by 24 clubs.
National league North consists of teams mostly located in Northern England, the English Midlands and East Anglia. In addition, it can include a small number of teams from the northern-most parts of the South West and South East. Since the start of the 2015–16 season, the league has been known as the National League North.

==History==
The Conference North was introduced in 2004 as part of a major restructuring of English non-League football. The champions are automatically promoted to the National League. A second promotion place goes to the winners of play-offs involving the teams finishing in second to seventh place (expanded from four to six teams in the 2017–18 season). The three bottom clubs are relegated to Step 3 leagues. Teams from this division, as well as from the National League South, enter the FA Cup at the Second Qualifying Round.

For sponsorship reasons, the division was known as the Nationwide North from its formation in 2004 until 2007, when it was renamed the Blue Square North. In 2010 it was renamed the Blue Square Bet North. When the Blue Square sponsorship ended in 2013, it was renamed the Skrill North until the 2014–15 season, when it was renamed the Vanarama North. A further name change followed in 2015, when the division was renamed the Vanarama National League North.

The National League North was scheduled to expand to 24 teams in 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the 2020–21 National League North season was curtailed and voided after written resolutions were put to a vote. No teams were relegated. Expansion would be at last implemented before the 2022–23 season when the bottom club was relegated and four promoted from Step 3.

==Member clubs for 2024–25==
The member clubs for the 2024–25 season are as follows:

<doc id="645486" wikidata="Q205718" url="?curid=645486" title="Zirid dynasty">
<text>The Zirid dynasty (), Banu Ziri (), was a Sanhaja Berber dynasty from what is now Algeria which ruled the central Maghreb from 972 to 1014 and Ifriqiya (eastern Maghreb) from 972 to 1148.

Descendants of Ziri ibn Manad, a military leader of the Fatimid Caliphate and the eponymous founder of the dynasty, the Zirids were emirs who ruled in the name of the Fatimids. The Zirids gradually established their autonomy in Ifriqiya through military conquest until officially breaking with the Fatimids in the mid-11th century. The rule of the Zirid emirs opened the way to a period in North African history where political power was held by Berber dynasties such as the Almoravid dynasty, Almohad Caliphate, Zayyanid dynasty, Marinid Sultanate and Hafsid dynasty.

Under Buluggin ibn Ziri the Zirids extended their control westwards and briefly occupied Fez and much of present-day Morocco after 980, but encountered resistance from the local Zenata Berbers who gave their allegiance to the Caliphate of Cordoba. To the east, Zirid control was extended over Tripolitania after 978 and as far as Ajdabiya (in present-day Libya). One member of the dynastic family, Zawi ibn Ziri, revolted and fled to al-Andalus, eventually founding the Taifa of Granada in 1013, after the collapse of the Caliphate of Cordoba. Another branch of the Zirids, the Hammadids, broke away from the main branch after various internal disputes and took control of the territories of the central Maghreb after 1015. The main branch of the Zirids, also called the Badisides, occupied only Ifriqiya between 1048 and 1148. They were based in Kairouan until 1057, when they moved the capital to Mahdia on the coast. The Zirids of Ifriqiya also intervened in Sicily during the 11th century, as the Kalbids, the dynasty who governed the island on behalf of the Fatimids, fell into disorder.

The Zirids of Granada surrendered to the Almoravids in 1090, but the Badicides and the Hammadids remained independent during this time. Sometime between 1041 and 1051 the Zirid ruler al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis renounced the Fatimid Caliphs and recognized the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate. In retaliation, the Fatimids instigated the migration of the Banu Hilal tribe to the Maghreb, dealing a serious blow to Zirid power in Ifriqiya. In the 12th century, the Hilalian invasions combined with the attacks of the Normans of Sicily along the coast further weakened Zirid power. The last Zirid ruler, al-Hasan, surrendered Mahdia to the Normans in 1148, thus ending independent Zirid rule. The Almohad Caliphate conquered the central Maghreb and Ifriqiya by 1160, ending the Hammadid dynasty in turn and finally unifying the whole of the Maghreb.

== History ==

=== Origins and establishment ===
The Zirids were Sanhaja Berbers, from the sedentary Talkata tribe, originating from the area of modern Algeria. In the 10th century this tribe served as vassals of the Fatimid Caliphate, an Isma&#x27;ili Shi&#x27;a state that challenged the authority of the Sunni Abbasid caliphs. The progenitor of the Zirid dynasty, Ziri ibn Manad (r. 935–971) was installed as governor of the central Maghreb (roughly north-eastern Algeria today) on behalf of the Fatimids, guarding the western frontier of the Fatimid Caliphate. 

With Fatimid support Ziri founded his own capital and palace at &#x27;Ashir, south-east of Algiers, in 936. He proved his worth as a key ally in 945, during the Kharijite rebellion of Abu Yazid, when he helped break Abu Yazid&#x27;s siege of the Fatimid capital, Mahdia. After playing this valuable role, he expanded &#x27;Ashir with a new palace circa 947. In 959 he aided Jawhar al-Siqili on a Fatimid military expedition which successfully conquered Fez and Sijilmasa in present-day Morocco. On their return home to the Fatimid capital they paraded the emir of Fez and the &quot;Caliph&quot; Ibn Wasul of Sijilmasa in cages in a humiliating manner. After this success, Ziri was also given Tahart to govern on behalf of the Fatimids. He was eventually killed in battle against the Zanata in 971.

When the Fatimids moved their capital to Egypt in 972, Ziri&#x27;s son Buluggin ibn Ziri (r. 971–984) was appointed viceroy of Ifriqiya, spawning a dynasty whose rulers held the title of &quot;amir&quot;. Buluggin&#x27;s position was confirmed on 2 October 972 at Sardaniya, a place outside Kairouan where the Fatimid caliph al-Mu&#x27;izz was preparing for his departure to Egypt. On 20 December 972, Buluggin took up residence in Sabra al-Mansuriyya, the Fatimid caliph&#x27;s former palace-city just outside the walls of Kairouan, where his successors continued to reside until the mid-11th century. Buluggin spent much of his time in the west, however. From 974 onward he entrusted the governance of Ifriqiya to Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Katib, a secretary with whom he replaced the Fatimid-appointed secretary, Ziyadat Allah. In 974 or 977–978 (364 or 367 AH), he founded another capital and palace complex in Ashir, next to his father&#x27;s foundation, which he favoured over Kairouan. Ashir continued to be the capital of the Zirids in the central Maghreb, while Kairouan was the capital of Ifriqiya.

Buluggin soon led a new expedition west and by 980 he had conquered Fez and most of the western Maghreb (present-day Morocco), which had previously been retaken by the Umayyads of Cordoba in 973. He also led a successful expedition to Barghawata territory, from which he brought back a large number of slaves to Ifriqiya. In 978 the Fatimids also granted Buluggin overlordship of Tripolitania (in present-day Libya), allowing him to appoint his own governor in Tripoli. In 984 Buluggin died in Sijilmasa from an illness and his successor decided to abandon Morocco in 985.

=== Buluggin&#x27;s successors and the first divisions ===
After Buluggin&#x27;s death, he was succeeded by his son Al-Mansur ibn Buluggin (r. 984–996). After his departure to the west in 979, Bulugin had not returned to Kairouan and during this time his appointee, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Katib, had amassed considerable power and influence in Ifriqiya. As a result, al-Mansur became involved in a confrontation with Abd Allah starting in 987. Later Zirid sources portray Abd Allah as a rebel who was aided by the Fatimid Caliphs, because the latter now preferred him over al-Mansur and wished to impose a new arrangement in Ifriqiya. In the end, al-Mansur ordered the successful assassination of Abd Allah and his son. In 989–990 he also suppressed a revolt by the Kutama, the traditional source of the Fatimid army, under the leadership of a pretender named Abu&#x27;l-Faraj. Following these challenges, al-Mansur was finally able to reunify the Zirid realm, but he was obliged to move his principal residence from &#x27;Ashir to al-Mansuriyya (Kairouan) in 991, leaving his brother Yattufat to govern &#x27;Ashir.

With al-Mansur&#x27;s succession, the rule of the Zirid was now being passed on through the son of Buluggin and his descendants. This alienated the other sons of Ziri ibn Manad, who now found themselves excluded from power. In 999 many of these brothers launched a rebellion in &#x27;Ashir against Badis ibn al-Mansur (r. 996–1016), Buluggin&#x27;s grandson, marking the first serious break in the unity of the Zirids. The rebels were defeated in battle by Hammad ibn Buluggin, Badis&#x27; uncle, and most of the brothers were killed. The only remaining brother of stature, Zawi ibn Ziri, led the remaining rebels westwards and sought new opportunity in al-Andalus under the Umayyads Caliphs of Cordoba, the former enemies of the Fatimids and Zirids. He and his followers eventually founded an independent kingdom in al-Andalus, the &quot;Taifa&quot; of Granada, in 1013.

After 1001 Tripolitania broke away under the leadership of Fulful ibn Sa&#x27;id ibn Khazrun, a Maghrawa leader who founded the Banu Khazrun dynasty, which endured until 1147. Fulful fought a protracted war against Badis ibn al-Mansur and sought outside help from the Fatimids and even from the Umayyads of Cordoba, but after his death in 1009 the Zirids were able to retake Tripoli for a time. The region nonetheless remained effectively under control of the Banu Khazrun, who fluctuated between practical autonomy and full independence, often playing the Fatimids and the Zirids against each other. The Zirids finally lost Tripoli to them in 1022.

Badis appointed Hammad ibn Buluggin as governor of &#x27;Ashir and the western Zirid territories in 997. He gave Hammad a great deal of autonomy, allowing him to campaign against the Zanata and control any new territories he conquered. Hammad constructed his own capital, the Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad, in 1008, and in 1015 he rebelled against Badis and declared himself independent altogether, while also recognizing the Abbasids instead of the Fatimids as caliphs. Badis besieged Hammad&#x27;s capital and nearly subdued him, but died in 1016 shortly before this could be accomplished. His son and successor, al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis (r. 1016–1062), defeated Hammad in 1017, which forced the negotiation of a peace agreement between them. Hammad resumed his recognition of the Fatimids as caliphs but remained independent, forging a new Hammadid state which controlled a large part of present-day Algeria thereafter. Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad was retained as the Hammadid capital, while &#x27;Ashir became its second city.

=== Apogee in Ifriqiya ===
The Zirid period of Ifriqiya is considered a high point in its history, with agriculture, industry, trade and learning, both religious and secular, all flourishing, especially in their capital, Qayrawan (Kairouan). The early reign of al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis (r. 1016–1062) was particularly prosperous and marked the height of their power in Ifriqiya. In the eleventh century, when the question of Berber origin became a concern, the dynasty of al-Mu&#x27;izz started, as part of the Zirids&#x27; propaganda, to emphasize its supposed links to the Himyarite kings as a title to nobility, a theme that was taken the by court historians of the period. Management of the area by later Zirid rulers was neglectful as the agricultural economy declined, prompting an increase in banditry among the rural population. The relationship between the Zirids and their Fatimid overlords varied - 20,000 Shiites were killed in the 1016 Ismaili massacre in Ifriqiya, and the Fatimids encouraged the defection of Tripolitania from the Zirids, but nevertheless the relationship remained close. In the 1040s, the Zirids broke away completely by adopting Sunni Islam and recognizing the Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs, a move which was popular with the urban Arabs of Kairouan.

In Sicily the Kalbids continued to govern on behalf of the Fatimids but the island descended into political disarray during the 11th century, inciting the Zirids to intervene on the island. In 1025 (or 1021), al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis sent a fleet of 400 ships to the island in response to the Byzantines reconquering Calabria (in southern Italy) from the Muslims, but the fleet was lost in a powerful storm off the coast of Pantelleria. In 1036, the Muslim population of the island request aid from al-Mu&#x27;izz to overthrow the Kalbid emir , whose rule they considered flawed and unjust. The request also contained a pledge to recognize al-Mu&#x27;izz as their ruler. Al-Mu&#x27;izz, eager to expand his influence after the fragmentation of Zirid North Africa, accepted and sent his son, &#x27;Abdallah, to the island with a large army. Al-Akhal, who had been in negotiations with the Byzantines, requested help from them. A Byzantine army intervened and defeated the Zirid army on the island, but it then withdrew to Calabria, allowing &#x27;Abdallah to finish off al-Akhal. Al-Akhal was besieged in Palermo and killed in 1038. &#x27;Abdallah was subsequently forced to withdraw from the island, either due to the ever-divided Sicilians turning against him or due to another Byzantine invasion in 1038, led by George Maniakes. Another Kalbid amir, al-Hasan al-Samsam, was elected to govern Sicily, but Muslim rule there disintegrated into various petty factions leading up to the Norman conquest of the island in the second half of the 11th century.

=== Hilalian invasions and withdrawal to Mahdia ===
The Zirids renounced the Fatimids and recognized the Abbasid Caliphs in 1048-49, or sometime between 1041 and 1051. The recognition of the Abbasids was nominal, as the Abbasids themselves were in political decline and could not impose direct authority in the region. In retaliation against the Zirids, the Fatimids sent the Arab tribes of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym to the Maghreb. The Banu Sulaym settled first in Cyrenaica, but the Banu Hilal continued towards Ifriqiya. The Zirids attempted to stop their advance towards Ifriqiya, they sent 30,000 Sanhaja cavalry to meet the 3,000 Arab cavalry of Banu Hilal in the Battle of Haydaran of 14 April 1052. Nevertheless, the Zirids were decisively defeated and were forced to retreat, opening the road to Kairouan for the Hilalian Arab cavalry. The resulting anarchy devastated the previously flourishing agriculture, and the coastal towns assumed a new importance as conduits for maritime trade and bases for piracy against Christian shipping, as well as being the last holdout of the Zirids. The Banu Hilal invasions eventually forced al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis to abandon Kairouan in 1057 and move his capital to Mahdia, while the Banu Hilal largely roamed and pillaged the interior of the former Zirid territories. 

As a result of the Zirid withdrawal, various local principalities emerged in different areas. In Tunis, the shaykhs of the city elected Abd al-Haqq ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Khurasan (r. 1059-1095) as local ruler. He founded the local Banu Khurasan dynasty that governed the city thereafter, alternately recognizing the Hammadids or the Zirids as overlords depending on the circumstances. In Qabis (Gabès), the Zirid governor, al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Muhammad ibn Walmiya remained loyal until 1062 when, outraged by the expulsion of his two brothers from Mahdia by al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis, he declared his independence and placed himself under the protection of Mu&#x27;nis ibn Yahya, a chief of Banu Hilal. Sfaqus (Sfax) was declared independent by the Zirid governor, Mansur al-Barghawati, who was murdered and succeeded by his cousin Hammu ibn Malil al-Barghawati. 

Al-Mui&#x27;zz ibn Badis was succeeded by his son, Tamim ibn al-Mu&#x27;izz (r. 1062-1108), who spent much of his reign attempting to restore Zirid power in the region. In 1063 he repelled a siege of Mahdia by the independent ruler of Sfax while also capturing the important port of Sus (Sousse). Meanwhile, the Hammadid ruler al-Nasir ibn &#x27;Alannas (r. 1062-1088) began to intervene in Ifriqiya around this time, having his sovereignty recognized in Sfax, Tunis, and Kairouan. Tamim organized a coalition with some of the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym tribes and succeeded in inflicting a heavy defeat on al-Nasir at the Battle of Sabiba in 1065. The war between the Zirids and Hammadids continued until 1077, when a truce was negotiated, sealed by a marriage between Tamim and one of al-Nasir&#x27;s daughters. In 1074 Tamim sent a naval expedition to Calabria where they ravaged the Italian coasts, plundered Nicotera and enslaved many of its inhabitants. The next year (1075) another Zirid raid resulted in the capture of Mazara in Sicily; however, the Zirid emir rethought his involvement in Sicily and decided to withdraw, abandoning what they had briefly held. In 1087, the Zirid capital, Mahdia, was sacked by the Pisans. According to Ettinghausen, Grabar, and Jenkins-Madina, the Pisa Griffin is believed to have been part of the spoils taken during the sack. In 1083 Mahdia was besieged by a chief of the Banu Hilal, Malik ibn &#x27;Alawi. Unable to take the city, Malik instead turned to Kairouan and captured that city, but Tamim marched out with his entire army and defeated the Banu Hilal forces, at which point he also brought Kairouan back under Zirid control. He went on to capture Gabès in 1097 and Sfax in 1100. Gabès, however, soon declared itself independent again under the leadership of the Banu Jami&#x27;, a family from the Riyahi branch of the Banu Hilal.

Tamim&#x27;s son and successor, Yahya ibn Tamim (r. 1108-1116), formally recognized the Fatimid caliphs again and received an emissary from Cairo in 1111. He captured an important fortress near Carthage called Iqlibiya and his fleet launched raids against Sardinia and Genoa, bringing back many captives. He was assassinated in 1116 and succeeded by his son, &#x27;Ali ibn Yahya (r. 1116-1121). &#x27;Ali continued to recognize the Fatimids, receiving another embassy from Cairo in 1118. He imposed his authority on Tunis, but failed to recapture Gabès from its local ruler, Rafi&#x27; ibn Jami&#x27;, whose counterattack he then had to repel from Mahdia. He was succeeded by his son al-Hasan in 1121, the last Zirid ruler.

=== End of Zirid rule ===
During the 1130s and 1140s the Normans of Sicily began to capture cities and islands along the coast of Ifriqiya. Jerba was captured in 1135 and Tripoli was captured in 1146. In 1148, the Normans captured Sfax, Gabès, and Mahdia. In Mahdia, the population was weakened by years of famine and the bulk of the Zirid army was away on another campaign when the Norman fleet, commanded by George of Antioch, arrived off the coast. Al-Hasan decided to abandon the city, leaving it to be occupied, which effectively ended the Zirid dynasty&#x27;s rule. Al-Hasan fled to the citadel of al-Mu&#x27;allaqa near Carthage and stayed there for a several months. He planned to flee to the Fatimid court in Egypt but the Norman fleet blocked his way, so instead he headed west, making for the Almohad court of &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min in Marrakesh. He obtained permission from Yahya ibn al-&#x27;Aziz, the Hammadid ruler, to cross his territory, but after entering Hammadid territory he was detained and placed under house arrest in Algiers. When &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min captured Algiers in 1151, he freed al-Hasan, who accompanied him back to Marrakesh. Later, when &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min conquered Mahdia in 1160, placing all of Ifriqiya under Almohad rule, al-Hasan was with him. &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min appointed him governor of Mahdia, where he remained, residing in the suburb of Zawila, until &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min&#x27;s death in 1163. The new Almohad caliph, Abu Ya&#x27;qub Yusuf, subsequently ordered him to come back to Marrakesh, but al-Hasan died along the way in Tamasna in 1167.

== Economy ==
The Zirid period was a time of great economic prosperity. The departure of the Fatimids to Cairo, far from ending this prosperity, saw its amplification under the Zirid and Hammadid rulers. Referring to the government of the Zirid emir al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis, the historian Ibn Khaldun reports: &quot;It [has] never [been] seen by the Berbers of that country a kingdom more vast and more flourishing than his own.&quot; The northern regions produced wheat in large quantities, while the region of Sfax was a major hub of olive production and the cultivation of the date was an important part of the local economy in Biskra. Other crops such as sugar cane, saffron, cotton, sorghum, millet and chickpea were grown. The breeding of horses and sheep flourished and fishing provided plentiful food. The Mediterranean was also an important part of the economy, even though it was, for a time, abandoned after the departure of the Fatimids, when the priority of the Zirid Emirs turned to territorial and internal conflicts. Their maritime policy enabled them to establish trade links, in particular for the importation of the timber necessary for their fleet, and enabled them to begin an alliance and very close ties with the Kalbid Emirs of Sicily. They did, however, face blockade attempts by the Venetians and Normans, who sought to reduce their wood supply and thus their dominance in the region.

The Arab chronicler Ibn Hawqal visited and described the city of Algiers in the Zirid era: &quot;The city of Algiers is built on a gulf and surrounded by a wall. It contains a large number of bazaars and a few sources of good water near the sea. It is from these sources that the inhabitants draw the water they drink. In the outbuildings of this town are very extensive countryside and mountains inhabited by several tribes of the Berbers. The chief wealth of the inhabitants consists of herds of cattle and sheep grazing in the mountains. Algiers supplies so much honey that it forms an export object, and the quantity of butter, figs and other commodities is so great that it is exported to Kairouan and elsewhere&quot;.

== Culture ==

=== Literature ===

Abd al-Aziz ibn Shaddad was a Zirid chronicler and prince. He wrote &quot;Kitab al-Jam&#x27; wa &#x27;l-bayan fi akhbar al-Qayrawan&quot; () about the history of Qayrawan. Al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis, the Zirid ruler, was also himself an author and wrote an important treatise on the arts of the book, covering subjects such as calligraphy, bookbinding, and illumination.

=== Architecture ===
The Zirid dynasty was responsible for various constructions and renovations throughout the Maghreb. Zirid and Hammadid architecture in North Africa was closely linked to Fatimid architecture, but also influenced Norman architecture in Sicily. The Zirid palace at &#x27;Ashir (near present-day Kef Lakhdar), built in 934 by Ziri ibn Manad (who served the Fatimids), is one of the oldest palaces in the Maghreb to have been discovered and excavated. As independent rulers, however, the Zirids of Ifriqiya seem to have built few structures on a grand scale and there are few surviving major monuments from this period. They reportedly built a new palace at al-Mansuriyya, the former Fatimid capital near Kairouan, but it has not been uncovered by modern archeologists, except for some fragments of carved stucco decoration. At the Zaytuna Mosque in Tunis an elegantly-designed ribbed dome, called the &quot;Qubbat al-Bahw&quot;, was added to the entrance of the prayer hall in 991 and is attributed to the patronage of Al-Mansur ibn Buluggin. The Great Mosque of Kairouan was restored by Al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis in the 11th century. From this restoration some brightly-painted wooden ceilings have survived, featuring arabesques of scrolling vegetal motifs. Under Al-Mu’izz the Zirids also built the Sidi Abu Marwan mosque in Annaba. A major remodeling of the Great Mosque of Sfax, including the construction of a new minaret and an unusually decorated exterior façade, has also been attributed to the Zirid period (probably 10th century) by Georges Marçais and Lucien Golvin. 

The Hammadids, for their part, built an entirely new fortified capital at Qal&#x27;at Bani Hammad, founded in 1007. Although abandoned and destroyed in the 12th century, the city has been studied by modern archeologists and is one of the best-preserved medieval Islamic capitals in the world. The Zirid branch in Granada was also responsible for turning it into one of the major cities of al-Andalus. Among the surviving remains of the Zirid period in Granada today are a section of its original city walls, an extensive system of cisterns on the Albaicín hill, and the former minaret of a mosque (now part of the Church of San José).

=== Art ===

The Zirids were also patrons of the arts. Important examples of woodwork commissioned for mosques have survived from this period. Buluggin ibn Ziri commissioned the production of a minbar for the Mosque of the Andalusians in Fez. The minbar, whose original fragments are now preserved in a museum, bears an inscription that dates it to the year 980, around the time of Buluggin&#x27;s military expedition to this region. The wooden &quot;maqsura&quot; in the Great Mosque of Kairouan is believed to date from al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis&#x27;s restoration of the building. It is the oldest &quot;maqsura&quot; in the Islamic world to be preserved &quot;in situ&quot; and was commissioned by al-Mu῾izz ibn Badis in the first half of the 11th century (though later restored). It is one of the most significant works of art from the Zirid period, notable for its elaborately carved woodwork featuring arabesque motifs and a Kufic inscription dedicated to al-Mu&#x27;izz. 

Zirid art is also known for its decorated manuscripts. This art form flourished in Kairouan under Zirid rule and manuscripts from this city were exported throughout the Islamic world. One important example is the so-called &quot;Nurse&#x27;s Qur&#x27;an&quot; (), a Qur&#x27;an manuscript copied in 1020 by &#x27;Ali ibn Ahmad al-Warraq for Fatima, the nursemaid of al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis. It is one of many Qur&#x27;an manuscripts that were donated to the Great Mosque of Kairouan and it is one of the most important surviving Islamic manuscripts commissioned by a female patron in North Africa. Its folios are now kept in several museums and collections around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bardo Museum, and the David Collection.

Emblem

According to Historian Hady Roger Idris, the colour of the flags is unknown, but he stressed : &quot;The name of the Fatimids appeared on the flags (a&#x27;làm), pennants (rayât), standards (bunûd) and on the edging of ceremonial clothing. Flags and robes of honour do not appear to have been made in Ifrïqiya; they were gifts from the caliph.&quot; He added: &quot;Let us recall that the official livery of the Zirids, vassals of the Fatimids, had to be white since we have seen that they adopted black, the colour of the Abbasids, after having broken with Cairo.&quot; Michael Brett points out that the Zirid prince Al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis renounced his alleigence to the Fatimids by changing his colors from Fatimid white to Abbasid black. 

== List of Zirid rulers ==
The following list includes the Zirid rulers who ruled in the Maghreb:

* Ziri ibn Manad, d. 971 CE (as Fatimid governor)

* Buluggin ibn Ziri, 972–984 (as viceroy of the Fatimids in Ifriqiya and the Maghreb)
* al-Mansur ibn Buluggin, 984–996
* Badis ibn al-Mansur, 996–1016
After 1015, the Hammadid branch ruled in the central Maghreb while the descendants of Badis ibn al-Mansur continued to rule in Ifriqiya:
* al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis, 1016–1062
* Tamim ibn al-Mu&#x27;izz, 1062–1108
* Yahya ibn Tamim, 1108–1116
* Ali ibn Yahya, 1116–1121
* al-Hasan ibn Ali, 1121–1148








== Offshoots of the Zirid dynasty ==
=== Zirids of Granada ===

After the rebellion of Buluggin&#x27;s brothers failed in 999, Zawi ibn Ziri sought to move to al-Andalus, which was under Umayyad control. The &quot;hajib&quot; of Caliph Hisham II (r. 976–1009) and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Caliphate of Córdoba at the time, Ibn Abi ʿAmir al-Mansur (also known as Almanzor), initially refused to allow Zawi&#x27;s immigration to al-Andalus, believing his reputation as a troublemaker. However, his son and successor, &#x27;Abd al-Malik al-Muẓaffar (r. 1002–1008), seeking able military commanders, granted Zawi and his followers permission to come to Cordoba, where they subsequently became an important part of al-Muzaffar&#x27;s army. The Caliphate of Córdoba fragmented after 1008, a period known as the &quot;fitna&quot; of al-Andalus. Zawi initially played a role, along with other Berber factions, in the siege of Córdoba between 1010 and 1013. By the end of the siege they succeeded in installing their own puppet caliph in Córdoba, Sulayman al-Musta&#x27;in, but by this point Zawi and other factions were seeking political fortunes elsewhere in al-Andalus. The new caliph granted Zawi and his faction the province of Ilbira (Elvira) to settle in 1013. After moving the capital from &quot;Madinat Ilbira&quot; to the hilltop settlement of &quot;Gharnāṭa&quot; (Granada) that year, Zawi founded the &quot;Taifa&quot; kingdom of Granada. Arab sources consider him to be the founder of the present-day city of Granada, a designation also repeated by some modern historians like Helen Rodgers, Stephen Cavendish, and Brian Catlos.

In 1018 the Umayyad pretender al-Murtada attempted to conquer Granada but was soundly defeated by the Zirids. In 1019 or 1020 Zawi left al-Andalus and returned to Ifriqiya, resuming his ambitions within the Zirid state there. His fate is not known for certain: according to Ibn Hayyan he died of the plague years later, while Abdallah ibn Buluggin&#x27;s memoirs claim he was poisoned not long after arriving in North Africa, but neither gives the date of his death. In Granada, Zawi&#x27;s nephew Habbus ibn Maksan was invited by the &quot;qadi&quot; of the city, Abu &#x27;Abdallah ibn Abi Zamanin, to take control of the new kingdom instead of one Zawi&#x27;s sons. Under the reign of Habus (1019–1038), the Taifa of Granada was consolidated and evolved into one of the most important political forces of al-Andalus during this period. During the reign of Badis Ibn Habus the Zirids of Granada defeated an attack by the Taifa of Almeria in 1038, annexing much of that kingdom&#x27;s territory and turning Almeria into a vassal state for several years, before they defeated the Abbadids of Seville in battle in 1039, gaining some territory in turn to the west. In 1056 they annexed the Taifa of Malaga. The Taifa of Granada was eventually conquered by the Almoravids of North Africa in 1090, putting an end to the independent kingdom.

=== Hammadid dynasty ===
Hammad ibn Buluggin, the son of Buluggin and uncle of Badis ibn al-Mansur, was appointed governor of &#x27;Ashir in 997 and given a great deal of autonomy, even going so far as to build a new capital for himself, known as the Qal&#x27;a Bani Hammad. The split between Hammad and his nephew came when Badis declared his son as heir and attempted to designate a part of Hammad&#x27;s territory as a new principality to be governed by the crown prince. Hammad refused to let this happen and responded by ordering the name of the Fatimid caliph to be replaced with the Abbasid caliph in the &quot;khutba&quot; (Friday sermon) in mosques, a clear departure from Zirid political allegiances. A closely-fought war ended with Hammad and al-Mu&#x27;izz ibn Badis concluding a peace agreement which allowed Hammad to retain his effective independence.

The Hammadid state reached its apogee under the reign of al-Nasir ibn &#x27;Alannas (r. 1062-1088) during which it was briefly the most important state in the Maghreb. The Hammadid capital attracted scholars and artists from Kairouan, growing its cultural and economic importance. The Hammadids initially weathered the Banu Hilal invasions much better than their Zirid counterparts to the east and sometimes even allied with the new Arab tribes. Al-Nasir exploited the partial collapse of Zirid rule in Ifriqiya to have his own authority recognized in many of the main cities there, including Sfax, Kairouan, and Tunis. Pressures from the Banu Hilal tribes eventually forced al-Nasir&#x27;s successor, al-Mansur (r. 1088-1105), to move the capital to Bijaya (Béjaïa or Bougie), a city founded earlier by al-Nasir. Hammadid rule was eventually ended by the Almohads, led by &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min, who captured Bijaya in 1152. Soon after, &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min&#x27;s son captured Constantine, where the last Hammadid ruler, Yahya, had fled. Yahya was given a pension and allowed to retire in Marrakesh and then Sala (Salé), where he died in 1161 or 1162.

<text>Camp de Tarragona () is a natural and historical region, as well as one of the nine regions (&quot;vegueries&quot;) of Catalonia. It is the third most populated region, with 536,453 inhabitants as of 2022.

The region includes the counties of Tarragonès, Alt Camp, Baix Camp, Conca de Barberà and Priorat. It borders to the east with Penedès and Central Catalonia, to the north with Ponent and to the west with Terres de l&#x27;Ebre.

The capital is the city of Tarragona.

== History ==
The modern Camp de Tarragona roughly follows the old vegueria of Tarragona, which was abolished in 1716, following the Nueva Planta decrees, and replaced by the Castilian corregimientos.

The region was defined as a statistical region in 1987 in the Territorial Planning Laws approved by the Parliament of Catalonia, becoming a &quot;vegueria&quot; in January 2010. Prior to the region&#x27;s official establishment, several organisations and citizens of Reus had requested that it be named simply &quot;Camp&quot; and that it share its capital with the city of Reus, for decentralisation and economic purposes.

== Geography ==
The region&#x27;s most populous settlements are Tarragona, Reus, Valls and Cambrils. Salou is a key resort destination.

Camp de Tarragona is located in the south of the country, just above the Terres de l&#x27;Ebre. It includes a central plain, surrounded by the Pre-Coastal Range mountain chain on the west and in the north, with the Mediterranean sand beaches of the Costa Daurada on the east and limited in the south by the Coll de Balaguer.

The main rivers are the Francolí, the Gaià and the Foix.

The region is regarded as the second metropolitan area of Catalonia, hosting the most important chemical complex in Spain as well as one of the main ports. Among the most distinctive agricultural produce of the region are hazelnuts, olives, wine and fish. It is also one of the major tourist areas in Catalonia, mainly due to the variety of beaches, holiday attractions like the remains of the Roman important past of Tarragona (one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Spain), samples of the Catalan &quot;Modernisme&quot; style (particularly in Reus, Gaudí&#x27;s hometown) and PortAventura World (PortAventura Park, the most visited theme park in Spain, Ferrari Land and also the ).

== Population ==
== Transport ==
The region has a homonymous high-speed railway station located between the Tarragonès towns of La Secuita and Perafort, in the centre of the Tarragona-Reus-Valls area.

== Economy ==
The GDP of Camp de Tarragona makes up 7% of Catalonia&#x27;s. The productive structure is not homogeneous in the region, e.g. the primary sector is more important in Priorat and in Conca de Barberà than in the other counties. However, they all share wine as one of the main products of the sector. In terms of industry, in Alt Camp the paper sector plays a predominant role, whereas in Baix Camp it is the energy sector and in Tarragonès the chemical sector.

Tourism is particularly significant in the coastal townships, namely Salou and Cambrils. The Costa Daurada is Camp de Tarragona&#x27;s main tourist brand, and in addition to its beaches, it also houses the Port Aventura theme park.

Camp de Tarragona also has a public university, the University of Rovira i Virgili (URV), with facilities in the municipalities of Tarragona, Reus and Vila-seca. Founded in 1991, it currently offers a wide range of degrees and masters courses to over 11,000 students.

== Local media ==

=== Television ===
Although the most viewed channels are the ones broadcasting for the whole of Catalonia, such as those of Televisió de Catalunya or RTVE, Camp de Tarragona has two multiplexes for local broadcasting, with coverage for the western and eastern areas of the region each.

<text>The Wicks Organ Company is an organ manufacturer in Highland, Illinois in the United States where they build, repair, and restore organs.

==History==
The Wicks Organ Company was founded by Adolph Wick, John F. Wick, and Louis Wick in the early 1900s at their jewelry and watch making store in Highland, Illinois. A local priest asked John Wick to study organ; he studied organ at St. Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, and then became the church organist. The church later decided to replace an old reed organ with a pipe organ.

The brothers utilized their skills in watch making, cabinet making, and jewelry to construct a small, two manual and pedal, mechanical action pipe organ for the church. They incorporated as the Wicks Organ Company in 1906.

The Wicks Organ Company invented, patented, and trademarked the Direct Electric chest action. This action was created in 1916 and it is still in use today.

The Wicks opus list encompasses over 6,440 instruments installed mostly in the U.S. In January 2011, the company downsized, outsourcing some of its production to past employees. Third-generation family member Scott Wick is president.

<text>Ruslan Viktorovych Fedotenko (born January 18, 1979) is a former professional ice hockey winger.

A two-time Stanley Cup champion, in his National Hockey League (NHL) career he played for the Philadelphia Flyers, Tampa Bay Lightning, New York Islanders, Pittsburgh Penguins and the New York Rangers. Internationally, Fedotenko has competed for Ukraine in the 2002 Winter Olympics.

==Playing career==

=== Start in the NHL ===

As a youth, Fedotenko played in the 1993 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Ukraine.

Fedotenko went undrafted and first entered the NHL after being signed by the Philadelphia Flyers in 1999. He scored the overtime winning goal in Game 1 of the 2002 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals against the Ottawa Senators during the 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

=== Tampa Bay Lightning and first Stanley Cup win ===
After two seasons with the Flyers, he was traded in 2002 to the Tampa Bay Lightning, along with two second-round draft picks, in exchange for Tampa Bay&#x27;s first-round draft pick, which was used to draft Joni Pitkänen.

In 2004, Fedotenko won the Stanley Cup for the first time, scoring both Lightning goals in Game 7 of the Finals against the Calgary Flames. It was Tampa Bay&#x27;s first Stanley Cup in franchise history. After a career-high 26-goal, 41-point campaign in 2005–06, Fedotenko was re-signed as a restricted free agent in July 2006 to a one-year contract worth $1.65 million.

=== New York Islanders ===
Following his fourth season in Tampa Bay, Fedotenko signed a one-year, $2.9 million contract with the New York Islanders in July 2007, joining Mike Comrie and Bill Guerin as the Islanders&#x27; free agent acquisitions. He scored 33 points in his first and only season with the Islanders.

=== Pittsburgh Penguins and second Stanley Cup win ===
The following off-season, Fedotenko signed his third consecutive one-year contract, a $2.25 million deal with Pittsburgh Penguins in July 2008. Fedotenko neared career-high totals with 39 points in 65 games, benefiting as a winger on a talented Penguins team that featured centers Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Jordan Staal. He went on to tally 14 points in 24 post-season games with the Penguins in 2009, capturing his second career Stanley Cup as Pittsburgh defeated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games. After becoming an unrestricted free agent in July 2009, Fedotenko took a pay cut and agreed to a one-year, $1.8 million contract to remain with the Penguins.

=== New York Rangers ===
On 10 September 2010, Fedotenko accepted a try-out with the New York Rangers. After an impressive preseason, the Rangers signed Fedotenko to a one-year $1 million deal on 4 October 2010.

On 1 July 2011, Fedotenko re-signed with the New York Rangers, accepting a one-year, $1.4 million contract.

=== Return to the Flyers ===
On 5 July 2012, Fedotenko returned to where his NHL career began and signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Flyers for $1.75 million. During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Fedotenko played for the Kontinental Hockey League&#x27;s HC Donbass. Following the 2012–13 NHL season, Fedotenko signed a three-year, $9 million contract with Donbass.

=== Later career and retirement ===
On 20 January 2015, Fedotenko signed a professional try out contract with the Iowa Wild. To end the 2014–15 season, Fedotenko registered 3 goals in 13 games with Iowa. On 1 July 2015, Fedotenko signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with Iowa&#x27;s parent affiliate, the Minnesota Wild.

On 11 October 2016, Fedotenko announced his retirement from professional hockey. Fedotenko finished his career as a two-time Stanley Cup Champion, played in a total of 863 NHL games with five different NHL teams, scored 173 goals and registered 193 assists, totaling 366 points.

<text>A mufti (; , ) is an Islamic jurist qualified to issue a nonbinding opinion (&quot;fatwa&quot;) on a point of Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;). The act of issuing fatwas is called &quot;iftāʾ&quot;. Muftis and their &quot;fatwas&quot; has played an important role throughout Islamic history, taking on new roles in the modern era.

Tracing its origins to the Quran and early Islamic communities, the practice of &quot;ifta&quot; crystallized with the emergence of the traditional legal theory and schools of Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;madhahib&quot;). In the classical legal system, fatwas issued by muftis in response to private queries served to inform Muslim populations about Islam, advise courts on difficult points of Islamic law, and elaborate substantive law. In later times, muftis also issued public and political fatwas that took a stand on doctrinal controversies, legitimized government policies or articulated grievances of the population.

Traditionally, a mufti was seen as a scholar of upright character who possessed a thorough knowledge of the Quran, hadith and legal literature. Muftis acted as independent scholars in the classical legal system. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while Shia jurists in Iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.

With the spread of codified state laws and Western-style legal education in the modern Muslim world, muftis generally no longer play their traditional role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts. However, muftis have continued to advise the general public on other aspects of &quot;sharia&quot;, particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life. Some modern muftis are appointed by the state to issue fatwas, while others serve on advisory religious councils. Still others issue fatwas in response to private queries on television or over the internet. Modern public fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the Muslim world and beyond.

The legal methodology of modern &quot;ifta&quot; often diverges from pre-modern practice. While the proliferation of contemporary fatwas attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims, little research has been done to determine to what extent the Muslim public continues to acknowledge the religious authority of muftis or heeds their advice.

==Terminology==

The word mufti comes from the Arabic root &quot;f-t-y&quot;, whose meanings include &quot;youth, newness, clarification, explanation.&quot; A number of related terms derive from the same root. A mufti&#x27;s response is called a &quot;fatwa&quot;. The person who asks a mufti for a fatwa is known as &quot;mustafti&quot;. The act of issuing fatwas is called &quot;iftāʾ&quot;. The term &quot;futyā&quot; refers to soliciting and issuing fatwas.

==Origins==

The origins of muftis and the fatwa can be traced back to the Quran. On a number of occasions, the Quranic text instructs the Islamic prophet Muhammad how to respond to questions from his followers regarding religious and social practices. Several of these verses begin with the phrase &quot;When they ask you concerning ..., say ...&quot; In two cases (4:127, 4:176) this is expressed with verbal forms of the root &quot;f-t-y&quot;, which signify asking for or giving an authoritative answer. In the hadith literature, this three-way relationship between God, Muhammad, and believers, is typically replaced by a two-way consultation, in which Muhammad replies directly to queries from his Companions (&quot;sahaba&quot;).

According to Islamic doctrine, with Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, God ceased to communicate with mankind through revelation and prophets. At that point, the rapidly expanding Muslim community turned to Muhammad&#x27;s Companions, as the most authoritative voices among them, for religious guidance, and some of them are reported to have issued pronouncements on a wide range of subjects. The generation of Companions was in turn replaced in that role by the generation of Successors (&quot;tabi&#x27;un&quot;). The institution of &quot;ifta&quot; thus developed in Islamic communities under a question-and-answer format for communicating religious knowledge, and took on its definitive form with development of the classical theory of Islamic law. By the 8th century CE, muftis became recognized as legal experts who elaborated Islamic law and clarified its application to practical issues arising in the Islamic community.

==In pre-modern Islam==

===Mufti&#x27;s activity (&quot;iftāʾ&quot;)===

The legal theory of the &quot;ifta&quot; was formulated in the classical texts of &quot;usul al-fiqh&quot; (principles of jurisprudence), while more practical guidelines for muftis were found in manuals called &quot;adab al-mufti&quot; or &quot;adab al-fatwa&quot; (etiquette of the mufti/fatwa).

A mufti&#x27;s fatwa is issued in response to a query. Fatwas can range from a simple yes/no answer to a book-length treatise. A short fatwa may state a well-known point of law in response to a question from a lay person, while a &quot;major&quot; fatwa may give a judgment on an unprecedented case, detailing the legal reasoning behind the decision. Queries to muftis were supposed to address real and not hypothetical situations and be formulated in general terms, leaving out names of places and people. Since a mufti was not supposed to inquire into the situation beyond the information included in the query, queries regarding contentious matters were often carefully constructed to elicit the desired response. A mufti&#x27;s understanding of the query commonly depended on their grasp of local customs and colloquial expressions. In theory, if the query was unclear or not sufficiently detailed for a ruling, the mufti was supposed to state these caveats in their response. Muftis often consulted another mufti on difficult cases, though this practice was not foreseen by legal theory, which saw &quot;futya&quot; as a transaction between one qualified jurist and one &quot;unqualified&quot; petitioner.

In theory, a mufti was expected to issue fatwas free of charge. In practice, muftis commonly received support from the public treasury, public endowments or private donations. Taking of bribes was forbidden. Until the 11th or 12th century, the vast majority of jurists held other jobs to support themselves. These were generally lower- and middle-class professions such as tanning, manuscript copying or small trade.

===Role of muftis===

The classical institution of &quot;ifta&quot; is similar to &quot;jus respondendi&quot; in Roman law and the &quot;responsa&quot; in Jewish law.

Muftis have played three important roles in the classical legal system:
* managing information about Islam by providing legal advice to Muslim populations as well as counseling them in matters of ritual and ethics;
* advising courts of law on finer points of Islamic law, in response to queries from judges;
* elaborating substantive Islamic law, particularly though a genre of legal literature developed by author-jurists who collected fatwas of prominent muftis and integrated them into books.

Islamic doctrine regards the practice of &quot;ifta&quot; as a collective obligation (&quot;farḍ al-kifāya&quot;), which must be discharged by some members of the community. Before the rise of modern schools, the study of law was a centerpiece of advanced education in the Islamic world. A relatively small class of legal scholars controlled the interpretation of sharia on a wide range of questions essential to the society, ranging from ritual to finance. It was considered a requirement for qualified jurists to communicate their knowledge through teaching or issuing fatwas. The ideal mufti was conceived as an individual of scholarly accomplishments and exemplary morals, and muftis were generally approached with the respect and deference corresponding to these expectations.

Judges generally sought an opinion from a mufti with higher scholarly authority than themselves for difficult cases or potentially controversial verdicts. Fatwas were routinely upheld in courts, and if a fatwa was disregarded, it was usually because another fatwa supporting a different position was judged to be more convincing. If a party in a dispute was not able to obtain a fatwa supporting their position, they would be unlikely to pursue their case in court, opting for informal mediation instead, or abandoning their claim altogether. Sometimes muftis could be petitioned for a fatwa relating to a court judgement that has already been passed, acting as an informal appeals process, but the extent of this practice and its mechanism varied across history. While in most of the Islamic world judges were not required to consult muftis by any political authority, in Muslim Spain this practice was mandatory, so that a judicial decision was considered invalid without prior approval by a legal specialist.

Author-jurists collected fatwas by muftis of high scholarly reputation and abstracted them into concise formulations of legal norms for the benefit of judges, giving a summary of jurisprudence for a particular &quot;madhhab&quot; (legal school). Author-jurists sought out fatwas that reflected the social conditions of their time and place, often opting for later legal opinions which were at variance with the doctrine of early authorities. Research by Wael Hallaq and Baber Johansen has shown that the rulings of muftis collected in these volumes could, and sometimes did, have a significant impact on the development of Islamic law.

During the early centuries of Islam, the roles of mufti, author-jurist and judge were not mutually exclusive. A jurist could lead a teaching circle, conduct a fatwa session, and adjudicate court cases in a single day, devoting his night hours to writing a legal treatise. Those who were able to act in all four capacities were regarded as the most accomplished jurists.

===Qualifications of a mufti===

The basic prerequisite for issuing fatwas under the classical legal theory was religious knowledge and piety. According to the &quot;adab al-mufti&quot; manuals, a mufti must be an adult, Muslim, trusted and reliable, of good character and sound mind, an alert and rigorous thinker, trained as a jurist, and not a sinner. On a practical level, the stature of muftis derived from their reputation for scholarly expertise and upright character. Issuing of fatwas was among the most demanding occupations in medieval Islam and muftis were among the best educated religious scholars of their time.

According to legal theory, it was up to each mufti to decide when he was ready to practice. In practice, an aspiring jurist would normally study for several years with one or several recognized scholars, following a curriculum that included Arabic grammar, hadith, law and other religious sciences. The teacher would decide when the student was ready to issue fatwas by giving him a certificate (&quot;ijaza&quot;).

During the first centuries of Islam, it was assumed that a mufti was a &quot;mujtahid&quot;, i.e., a jurist who is capable of deriving legal rulings directly from the scriptural sources through independent reasoning (&quot;ijtihad&quot;), evaluating the reliability of hadith and applying or even developing the appropriate legal methodologies. Starting from around 1200 CE, legal theorists began to accept that muftis of their time may not possess the knowledge and legal skill to perform this activity. In addition, it was felt that the major question of jurisprudence had already been addressed by master jurists of earlier times, so that later muftis only had to follow the legal opinions established within their legal school (&quot;taqlid&quot;). At that point, the notions of &quot;mufti&quot; and &quot;mujtahid&quot; became distinguished, and legal theorists classified jurists into three or more levels of competence.

Unlike the post of &quot;qadi&quot;, which is reserved for men in the classical sharia system, fatwas could be issued by qualified women as well as men. In practice, the vast majority of jurists who completed the lengthy curriculum in linguistic and religious sciences required to obtain the qualification to issue fatwas were men. Slaves and persons who were blind or mute were likewise theoretically barred from the post of a judge, but not that of mufti.

===Mufti vs. judge===

The mufti and the judge play different roles in the classical sharia system, with corresponding differences between a fatwa and a &quot;qada&quot; (court decision):

* A fatwa is nonbinding, while a court decision is binding and enforceable.
* A fatwa may deal with rituals, ethical questions, religious doctrines and sometimes even philosophical issues, while court cases dealt with legal matters in the narrow sense.
* The authority of a court judgment applies only to the specific court case, while a fatwa applies to all cases that fit the premises of the query.
* A fatwa is made on the basis of information provided in the request, while a judge actively investigates the facts of the case.
* A judge evaluates rival claims of two parties in a dispute in order to reach a verdict, while a fatwa is made on the basis of information provided by a single petitioner.
* Fatwas by prominent jurists were collected in books as sources of precedent, while court decisions were entered into court registers, but not otherwise disseminated.
* While both muftis and judges were interpreters of sharia, judicial interpretation centered on evaluating evidence such as testimony and oath, while a mufti investigated textual sources of law (scripture and legal literature).
* In the classical legal system, judges were civil servants appointed by the ruler, while muftis were private scholars and not appointed officials.

===Institutions===

Before the 11th century CE, anyone who possessed scholarly recognition as an Islamic jurist could issue fatwas. Starting around that time, however, the public office of mufti began to appear alongside the private issuing of fatwas. In Khurasan, the rulers appointed a head of the local ulama, called &quot;shaykh al-Islam&quot;, who also functioned as the chief mufti. The Mamluks appointed four muftis, one for each of the four Sunni madhhabs, to the appeals courts of provincial capitals. The Ottomans organized muftis into a hierarchical bureaucracy with a chief mufti of the empire called &quot;shaykh al-islam&quot; at the top. The Ottoman &quot;shaykh al-Islam&quot; (Turkish: &quot;şeyhülislam&quot;), was among the most powerful state officials. Scribes reviewed queries directed to Ottoman muftis and rewrote them to facilitate issuing of fatwas. In Mughal India and Safavid Iran the chief mufti had the title of &quot;sadr&quot;.

For the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were educated in informal study circles, but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish institutions of higher religious learning known as madrasas in an effort to secure support and cooperation of the &quot;ulema&quot; (religious scholars). Madrasas, which were primarily devoted to the study of law, soon multiplied throughout the Islamic world, helping to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project.

In some states, such as Muslim Spain, muftis were assigned to courts in advisory roles. In Muslim Spain jurists also sat on a &quot;shura&quot; (council) advising the ruler. Muftis were additionally appointed to other public functions, such as market inspectors.

==== In Shia Islam ====

While the office of the mufti was gradually subsumed into the state bureaucracy in much of the Sunni Muslim world, Shia religious establishment followed a different path in Iran starting from the early modern era. During Safavid rule, independent Islamic jurists (&quot;mujtahids&quot;) claimed the authority to represent the hidden imam. Under the &quot;usuli&quot; doctrine that prevailed among Twelver Shias in the 18th century and under the Qajar dynasty, the &quot;mujtahids&quot; further claimed to act collectively as deputies of the imam. According to this doctrine, all Muslims are supposed to follow a high-ranking living &quot;mujtahid&quot; bearing the title of &quot;marja&#x27; al-taqlid&quot;, whose fatwas are considered binding, unlike fatwas in Sunni Islam. Thus, in contrast to Sunni muftis, Shia &quot;mujtahids&quot; gradually achieved increasing independence from the state.

===Public and political fatwas===

While most fatwas were delivered to an individual or a judge, some fatwas that were public or political in nature played an important role in religious legitimation, doctrinal disputes, political criticism, or political mobilization. As muftis were progressively incorporated into government bureaucracies in the course of Islamic history, they were often expected to support government policies. Ottoman sultans regularly sought fatwas from the chief mufti for administrative and military initiatives, including fatwas sanctioning jihad against Mamluk Egypt and Safavid Iran. Fatwas by the Ottoman chief mufti were also solicited by the rulers to legitimize new social and economic practices, such as financial and penal laws enacted outside of sharia, printing of nonreligious books (1727) and vaccination (1845).

At other times muftis wielded their influence independently of the ruler, and several Ottoman and Moroccan sultans were deposed by a fatwa. This happened, for example, to the Ottoman sultan Murad V on the grounds of his insanity. Public fatwas were also used to dispute doctrinal matters, and in some case to proclaim that certain groups or individuals who professed to be Muslim were to be excluded from the Islamic community (a practice known as &quot;takfir&quot;). In both political and scholarly sphere, doctrinal controversies between different states, denominations or centers of learning were accompanied by dueling fatwas. Muftis also acted to counteract the influence of judges and secular functionaries. By articulating grievances and legal rights of the population, public fatwas often prompted an otherwise unresponsive court system to provide redress.

==In the modern era==

===Modern institutions===

Under European colonial rule, the institution of &quot;dar al-ifta&quot; was established in a number of madrasas (law colleges) as a centralized place for issuing of fatwas, and these organizations to a considerable extent replaced independent muftis as religious guides for the general population. Following independence, most Muslim states established national organizations devoted to issuing fatwas. One example is the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta, founded in 1895, which has served to articulate a national vision of Islam through fatwas issued in response to government and private queries. National governments in Muslim-majority countries also instituted councils of senior religious scholars to advise the government on religious matters and issue fatwas. These councils generally form part of the ministry for religious affairs, rather than the justice department, which may have a more assertive attitude toward the executive branch.

While chief muftis of earlier times oversaw a hierarchy of muftis and judges applying traditional jurisprudence, most modern states have adopted European-influenced legal codes and no longer employ traditional judicial procedures or traditionally trained judges. State muftis generally promote a vision of Islam that is compatible with state law of their country.

Although some early theorists argued that muftis should not respond to questions on certain subjects, such as theology, muftis have in practice handled queries relating to a wide range of subjects. This trend continued in modern times, and contemporary state-appointed muftis and institutions for &quot;ifta&quot; respond to government and private queries on varied issues, including political conflicts, Islamic finance, and medical ethics, contributing to shaping a national Islamic identity.

Muftis in modern times have increasingly relied on the process of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, i.e. deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities (&quot;taqlid&quot;). While in the past muftis were associated with a particular school of law (&quot;madhhab&quot;), in the 20th century many muftis began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence.

Modern media have facilitated cooperative forms to &quot;ifta&quot;. Networks of muftis are commonly engaged by fatwa websites, so that queries are distributed among the muftis in the network, who still act as individual jurisconsults. In other cases, Islamic jurists of different nationalities, schools of law, and sometimes even denominations (Sunni and Shia), coordinate to issue a joint fatwa, which is expected to command greater authority with the public than individual fatwas. The collective fatwa (sometimes called &quot;ijtihād jamāʿī&quot;, &quot;collective legal interpretation&quot;) is a new historical development, and it is found in such settings as boards of Islamic financial institutions and international fatwa councils.

There exists no international Islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of Islamic law. An International Islamic Fiqh Academy was created by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, but its legal opinions are not binding.

===Role in politics===
In the modern era, public &quot;fatwa wars&quot; have reflected political controversies in the Muslim world, from anti-colonial struggles to the Gulf War of the 1990s, when muftis in some countries issued fatwas supporting collaboration with the US-led coalition, while muftis from other countries endorsed the Iraqi call for jihad against the US and its collaborators.

During the era of Western colonialism, some muftis issued fatwas seeking to mobilize popular resistance to foreign domination, while others were induced by colonial authorities to issue fatwas supporting accommodation with colonial rule. Muftis also intervened in the political process on many other occasions during the colonial era. For example, in 1904 a &quot;fatwa&quot; by Moroccan ulema achieved the dismissal of European experts hired by the state, while in 1907 another Moroccan fatwa succeeded in deposing the sultan for failing to defend the state against French aggression. The 1891 tobacco protest fatwa by the Iranian &quot;mujtahid&quot; Mirza Shirazi, which prohibited smoking as long as the British tobacco monopoly was in effect, also achieved its goals.

Some muftis in the modern era, like the mufti of the Lebanese republic in the mid-20th century and the Grand Mufti of the Sultanate of Oman, were important political leaders. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini used proclamations and fatwas to introduce and legitimize a number of institutions, including the Council of the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian Parliament. Khomeini&#x27;s most publicized fatwa was the proclamation condemning Salman Rushdie to death for his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;.

Many militant and reform movements in modern times have disseminated fatwas issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti. A famous example is the fatwa issued in 1998 by Osama bin Laden and four of his associates, proclaiming &quot;jihad against Jews and Crusaders&quot; and calling for killing of American civilians. In addition to denouncing its content, many Islamic jurists stressed that bin Laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or declare a jihad.

The Amman Message was a statement, signed in 2005 in Jordan by nearly 200 prominent Islamic jurists, which served as a &quot;counter-fatwa&quot; against a widespread use of &quot;takfir&quot; (excommunication) by jihadist groups to justify jihad against rulers of Muslim-majority countries. The Amman Message recognized eight legitimate schools of Islamic law and prohibited declarations of apostasy against them. The statement also asserted that fatwas can be issued only by properly trained muftis, thereby seeking to delegitimize fatwas issued by militants who lack the requisite qualifications.

Erroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals acting as muftis has at times given rise to complaints about a &quot;chaos&quot; in the modern practice of &quot;ifta&quot;.

===Role in society===
Advances in print media and the rise of the internet have changed the role played by muftis in modern society. In the pre-modern era, most fatwas issued in response to private queries were read only by the petitioner. Early in the 20th century, the Salafi reformist Shafi&#x27;i jurist Rashid Rida responded to thousands of queries from around the Muslim world on a variety of social and political topics in the regular &quot;fatwa&quot; section of his Cairo-based journal &quot;Al-Manar&quot;. In the late 20th century, when the Grand Mufti of Egypt Sayyid Tantawy issued a fatwa allowing interest banking, the ruling was vigorously debated in the Egyptian press by both religious scholars and lay intellectuals.

In the internet age, a large number of websites have appeared offering fatwas to readers around the world. For example, IslamOnline publishes an archive of &quot;live fatwa&quot; sessions, whose number approached a thousand by 2007, along with biographies of the muftis. Together muftis who issue call-in fatwas during radio shows and satellite television programs, these sites have contributed to the rise of new forms of contemporary &quot;ifta&quot;. Unlike the concise or technical pre-modern fatwas, fatwas delivered through modern mass media often seek to be more expansive and accessible to the wide public.

As the influence of muftis in the courtroom has declined in modern times, there has been a relative increase in the proportion of fatwas dealing with rituals and further expansion in purely religious areas like Quranic exegesis, creed, and Sufism. Modern muftis issue fatwas on topics as diverse as insurance, sex-change operations, Moon exploration, and beer drinking. In the private sphere, some muftis have begun to resemble social workers, giving advice on various personal issues encountered in everyday life. The vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims. However, there is little research available to indicate to what extent Muslims acknowledge the authority of muftis and heed their rulings in real life.

<text>A sovkhoz (, abbreviated from , &quot;sovetskoye khozyaystvo&quot;; ) was a form of state-owned farm in the Soviet Union.

It is usually contrasted with kolkhoz, which is a collective-owned farm. Just as the members of a kolkhoz were called &quot;kolkhozniks&quot; or &quot;kolkhozniki&quot; (колхозники), the workers of a sovkhoz were called &quot;sovkhozniki&quot; (совхозники).

==History==
Soviet state farms started to be created in 1918 as an ideological example of &quot;socialist agriculture of the highest order&quot;. 

Kolkhozes, or collective farms, were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While kolkhozy were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure, a sovkhoz would be organized by the state on land confiscated from former large estates (so-called &quot;state reserve land&quot; that was left over after distribution of land to individuals) and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind) among the members. 

In 1990, the Soviet Union had 23,500 sovkhozy, or 45% of the total number of large-scale collective and state farms. The average size of a sovkhoz was 15,300 hectares (153 km2), nearly three times the average kolkhoz (5,900 hectares or 59 km2 in 1990). Sovkhoz farms were more dominant in the Central Asian part of the Soviet Union. 

During the transition era of the 1990s, many state farms were reorganized using joint stock arrangements, although the development of land markets remained constrained by opposition to private ownership of land.

<text>The National League South, officially Vanarama National League South, is a professional Association football league in England. National League South is the second division of the National Leagues and step 2 of the NLS and sixth-highest tier overall in the English football league system, after the Premier League, the EFL leagues and the National League and is contested by 24 clubs.

National League South includes teams from the South East, London, and the South West, as well as teams from Essex.
The National League South was introduced in 2004 as part of a major restructuring of the National League System. Each year the champion of the league is automatically promoted to the National League. A second promotion place goes to the winner of a play-off involving the teams finishing in second to seventh place (expanded from four to six teams in the 2017–18 season). The three bottom clubs were relegated to Step 3 leagues.

For sponsorship reasons, it has been known as Blue Square South (2007–2010), Blue Square Bet South (2010–2013), Skrill South (2013–2014), the Vanarama Conference South (2014–2015), the Vanarama National League South (2015–2019) and the Motorama National League South following a three-year sponsorship deal announced in January 2019. Since the start of the 2015–16 season, the league is known as the National League South.

The National League South was reduced to 21 clubs for 2020–21 and was expected to expand to 24 teams in 2021–22. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the 2020–21 National League South season was curtailed and voided after written resolutions were put to a vote. No teams were relegated. Expansion would be implemented before the 2022–23 season, when the bottom club was relegated and four were promoted from Step 3. There are four relegations from the South since 2023.

==Current member clubs, 2024–25==
The current member clubs for the 2024–25 season are as follows:

<text>Redbridge Football Club is an English association football club based in Barkingside in the London Borough of Redbridge. Prior to July 2004 the club was known as Ford United F.C. The change of name was chosen to help associate the club within the local area and attract a larger support.

They should not be confused with the former Redbridge Forest, a predecessor of the current Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, though both come from the borough of Redbridge in Greater London.

==History==
The club&#x27;s roots lie in the car industry, which has long been a staple of the local economy in the surrounding part of East London and Essex.

The club was previously known as Ford United, which dated from a 1959 merger between two older clubs, Ford Sports (Dagenham), the football team of the workers at the huge local Ford Motors factory at Dagenham, and Briggs Sports, both of which were founded in 1934. Up until World War II, the latter actually began life as Briggs Motor Bodies and entered a team in the London League under that name between 1935 and 1951.

As Ford United, they performed well in the Aetolian League winning the title twice, and finishing runners up once. The club found itself in serious trouble at the start of 1995–96 season as sponsorship from the Ford Motor Company was ended and the disbanding of the club seemed highly likely, until then club vice-chairman, George Adams enlisted Sky Sports as sponsors, rescuing the club financially.

During the 2001–02 season Barkingside&#x27;s lease at their Oakside ground was sold on to Ford United who needed to find a permanent home to allow their progression up the football pyramid. Considerable investment by Jimmy Chapman, the then Chairman saw Oakside developed to a grade 1 ground.

From the start of the 2004–05 season, Ford United were renamed to Redbridge, as the club sought to establish a local identity and improve its support base.

Redbridge played the 2005–06 season in the Isthmian League Premier Division, as they were relegated after finishing bottom of Conference South, and played in the Isthmian League Division One North in the 2006–07 season after being relegated once again. New manager, ex-Wimbledon and Bolton Wanderers striker Dean Holdsworth was appointed on 30 June 2007. In the 2007–08 season, they missed the opportunity to be promoted back to the Isthmian League Premier Division, losing 5–4 on penalties to Canvey Island in the playoff final, after finishing third in the Isthmian League Division One North. On 18 May 2008, Holdsworth left his post as manager of Redbridge to take up the manager&#x27;s position at Newport County.

At the start of June 2008, former Dagenham &amp; Redbridge reserve team coach, Jay Devereux was appointed the club&#x27;s new manager. Devereux&#x27;s first season was blighted by floodlight problems at Oakside, but the team still finished a respectable eighth in the division. The side had a disappointing start to the 2009–10 season and towards the end of September, it was announced that Devereux and his coaching staff had resigned from their jobs. First team coach Dave Ross took charge for Redbridge&#x27;s game at Harlow Town, where they drew 3–3 after being 2–0 down and stayed as manager for the remainder of the season. Poor winter weather affected the side at the start of 2010, the team initially struggled with a fixture pile up but Ross managed to keep the side in the league avoiding relegation.

The 2010–11 season proved to be one of the most turbulent in the club&#x27;s history. Manager Dave Ross brought in Kris Taylor to form a management team. After a bad start to the season, which saw the club sitting bottom of the league and Ross was eventually asked to step down. Kris Taylor was confirmed as first team manager on 1 October 2010, after talks broke down with Kevin Durrant who looked all set to join the club. Taylor&#x27;s tenure ended in December 2010 when his work commitments affected the amount of time demanded to run a club of this stature meant he was unable to give 100% to the management of the team. First team coach Jody Brown was appointed manager on a short-term basis just before Christmas 2010 and he was able to bring some stability and stave off relegation with three games of the season still remaining.

Chairman Dan Holloway moved quickly at the end of the season to make the changes that will bring the structure and stability needed at a football club at this level. Terry Spillane was appointed first team manager after a highly successful spell with Stansted with Jody Brown reverting to a coaching role.

On 29 October 2011, Redbridge reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time since 2003 after beating Conference National side Ebbsfleet United 2–0. In the First Round they drew 0–0 with Oxford City and won the replay 2–1 after extra time, thanks to goals by Nathan Gordon and Ben Bradbury. They played League Two leaders Crawley Town in the Second Round, where they were beaten 5–0, against a side four divisions and 106 places above Redbridge in the league pyramid. The team ended the season well finishing 6th place just 4 points off the play off positions. However, soon after the season finished, Chairman Dan Holloway resigned from the club for personal reasons and, with the playing budget due to be cut, manager Terry Spillane felt it was not possible to move the team any further and he and his footballing staff left to join fellow Division One North side Maldon &amp; Tiptree.

A new joint management team made up of Del Robinson and ex Gravesend and Northfleet legend Steve Portway took charge for the 2012–13 season. After a poor start to the season, the team improved in the second half of the season and fought off survival on the last-day to finish 20th and secure another season in the Isthmian League. Former London Bari Chairman Imran Merchant took control of the club ahead of the 2013–14 season appointing Ricky Eaton alongside ex-Redbridge manager Dave Ross as joint managers of the club. After a steady season, Merchant stepped down with former Chairman Jimmy Chapman taking over again and although finished within the relegation positions were given a reprieve when Southern League side Clevedon Town lost a ground grading appeal. The following season saw no improvement on the pitch and although they performed well in the local cup competitions they finished bottom of Division One North resulting in relegation back to the Essex Senior League for the first time in 19 years.

Ricky Eaton took over from Jim Chapman in the boardroom combining the role of 1st team manager and chairman and an inconsistent debut season back in the Essex Senior League saw a 14th-place finish. The following season Dave Ross left the club to be replaced by ex Hornchurch and Canvey Island player Joey May and as a joint management team along with Ricky they assembled a strong side looking for promotion into the Isthmian League and although were in the top two promotion places for most of the season they eventually fell short finishing in 4th place.

The side were sitting in 8th position when the 2019–20 season was declared null and void due to the COVID-19 pandemic and although the 2020–21 season did commence in September Micky decided to step down from his position after just 5 matches for personal reasons. Chairman Ricky Eaton acted quickly in bringing former Aveley Reserves manager George Christou to the club however the season was severely disrupted due to the ongoing pandemic and government lockdowns resulting in the season being curtailed with him only managing the team for eight games.

After two seasons of disruption due to the pandemic, the 2021–22 season was fully completed and Christou led his side to a 3rd-place finish where they were still in contention with 2nd place and a potential play off place right up until the final day of the season. The following season they went one better by securing the runners up position and therefore entering an Inter League Play off Final against Step Four side Haywards Heath Town, which Redbridge won 3–2 to secure promotion back to the Isthmian League.

A first season back at Step Four saw a respectable 13th-place finish however the crowning glory was the winning of the Essex Senior Cup for the first ever time after defeating EFL League Two side Colchester United in a thrilling penalty shoot-out.

During the 2024–25 FA Cup, after defeating Great Wakering Rovers during a replay, Redbridge progressed to the preliminary round for the first time since the 2017–18 tournament.

<doc id="645510" wikidata="Q1817196" url="?curid=645510" title="Len Beadell">
<text>Leonard Beadell OAM BEM FIEMS (21 April 1923 – 12 May 1995) was a surveyor, road builder, bushman, artist and author, responsible for constructing over of roads and opening up isolated desert areas – some – of central Australia from 1947 to 1963. Born in West Pennant Hills, New South Wales, Beadell is sometimes called &quot;the last true Australian explorer&quot;.

==Early life==

Beadell&#x27;s paternal grandparents came from England in the mid-1870s. His father Fred Algernon Beadell was born in Sydney and mother Viola Pearl Mackay was from Townsville. They were married in Townsville on 19 December 1914, and soon moved to the Sydney area.

A daughter Phyllis was born in 1917, followed by Len in April 1923. Beadell&#x27;s primary education began at Gladesville Public School, Ryde in 1928 and continued at Burwood Public School in 1930, both suburbs of Sydney.

At the suggestion of a school friend, Beadell joined the 1st Burwood Scout Troop where he met the scoutmaster John Richmond, who was to have a major influence on Beadell&#x27;s life. Richmond had served in the army during World War I, and was employed as a draughtsman and surveyor for the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board in Sydney.

Between 1931 and 1941, Beadell spent most weekends on bush survey trips with other scouts and Richmond, camping and searching for old survey marks. He learnt about the technical aspects of astronomical sightings and how to use a theodolite. In 1938 with a group of six scouts, Richmond took Beadell to Lord Howe Island where they took star sightings and determined that the mapped position of the island was out by about in latitude.

Beadell finished his formal education at Sydney Grammar School in 1939. He went directly to a temporary surveying position with the water board in northern New South Wales, which had been arranged by Richmond.

==War service==
At the age of 18 in 1941, Beadell received his call up notice for the army, and was keen to enlist. The service period was specified as the length of the war, plus twelve months. His initial service in the Citizen Military Force was in the Australian Army Service Corps at Bathurst, New South Wales, where he spent most of the time driving three ton trucks. In February 1942, he was transferred to the 2nd Australian Field Survey Company, and carried out contour surveys for army maps.

In September 1942, he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force and was transferred to the 2 Aust Field Survey Section, the topographical survey and mapping unit of the New Guinea Force. In October he sailed for New Guinea serving with the survey section, renamed the 8 Aust Field Survey Section AIF in January 1943, for thirteen months. Most of 1943 was spent in the Milne Bay locality. It was here that Beadell developed his artistic skills by watching army topographical draughtsmen, whose job it was to draw maps from information supplied by surveyors. He was transferred to the 2 Section 6 Aust Topographical Survey Company AIF in Australia, returning to Sydney in November 1943 for a period of leave and further survey work in Queensland.

In January 1944 he was promoted to Corporal. In March 1945 he was back in New Guinea at Lae with the unit. The company moved by ship to Wewak where there was a large enemy presence. Their assigned tasks were to map the coastal area, and build a new airstrip. The strip was completed in August 1945, just as the war came to an end. 
On return to Australia in December 1945 he was posted to the 3 Aust Field Survey Company AIF in Melbourne.

==Survey exploration==
Len opted to stay in the Army at the end of the Second World War. He was promoted to Acting/Sergeant in May 1946. The 3 Aust Field Survey Company AIF was tasked to provide survey support to a new scientific exploration in the Darwin-Katherine region of the Northern Territory. Len volunteered to delay his discharge from the Army for twelve months to be able to participate in the task. When that assignment was completed in November, he was asked once more to waive his discharge, as another project was in the making. The British and Australian governments had decided to build a rocket testing range in outback South Australia. He volunteered to be part of an Army survey team for that project, being transferred to the 5 Aust Field Survey Company, a 4 Military District Detachment, in February 1947.

The initial survey reconnaissance for the project was conducted by the Director of Military Survey and Officer Commanding 5 Aust Field Survey Company AIF in 1946. The survey detachment of ten men, under the command of Major Lindsay Lockwood who had conducted a detailed survey reconnaissance in 1946, moved in March 1947 to &#x27;The Pines&#x27; area in what became known as the Woomera area. There they started an Army program of topographic mapping which continued until 1953, when responsibility for such surveys was transferred to the Department of the Interior. Len was promoted to Temporary/Warrant Officer Class 2 in February 1948, and elected to discharge in December 1948.

Further work was required to select and survey launching pad sites, the centreline of fire for rockets, and the airfield. The site of the future village was chosen, allowing for approach paths of the runway and natural drainage. In November 1949, he was asked to rejoin the project and began further surveying as an employee of the Long Range Weapons Establishment in August 1950. A site for the secret testing of a British atomic bomb was selected by Beadell in 1952. A road from Mabel Creek to the test site Emu Field was built by him in March 1953, his first road.

===Gunbarrel Highway===

Beadell&#x27;s best known road is the Gunbarrel Highway, named after the Gunbarrel Road Construction Party which was assembled by him. He said he tried whenever possible to make the road as straight as a gunbarrel. The road was built with initial reconnaissance and survey by Len (not the case in 1958 when the survey reconnaissance from Warburton to Carnegie was led by the Supervising Surveyor (Geodetic) Australian Division of National Mapping, Mr HA (Bill) Johnson MBE LS FIS Aust ), usually alone, pushing through raw scrub in a Land Rover.

He used a theodolite to observe the Sun or stars for latitude and longitude calculations. Once the line of the road had been decided, a bulldozer followed to cut a raw track, clearing away the spinifex and mulga scrub to form a basic level track. This was then graded using a standard road grader.

The Gunbarrel Highway was begun at Victory Downs homestead by road south of Alice Springs. It then pushed west to the Rawlinson Ranges, skirting south of the Gibson Desert, via the mission at Warburton, to connect to an existing road at Carnegie Station. The total distance was about . Len&#x27;s stories of the building of this road are told in the first of his numerous books &quot;Too Long in the Bush&quot;, a reading of which will give some insight into the incredible feat that building this road was. Len suffered near starvation, many mechanical breakdowns, countless punctures and other mishaps, all in searing desert heat, but seemingly took it all in his stride with good humour.

===Later roads===
Beadell&#x27;s sense of humour was well known, and he referred to many of his roads as &quot;highways&quot;. The description stuck, and maps show the subject roads as highways, despite the reality that they have degraded to single lane unsealed tracks through the remote arid areas of central Australia.

Following the Gunbarrel Highway, Len built further roads by the same method, naming most of them after his family. The Connie Sue Highway for his daughter, the Gary Highway and Gary Junction Road for his son, the Anne Beadell Highway for his wife and Jackie Junction for his youngest daughter. These roads further opened up the inhospitable country, for a variety of purposes. Beadell chose and surveyed the location for the Giles Meteorological Station and airstrip during construction of the Gunbarrel Highway.

===Bush dentist===
During a break from construction of the Gunbarrel Highway in June 1957, Beadell convinced a visiting dental surgeon at Woomera, Dr Bruce Dunstan, to give him a crash course on tooth extraction. Beadell had prior experience of the trouble that teeth could cause himself and his crew when days or weeks away from city facilities. This instruction and further assistance from an Alice Springs dentist, Ray Meldrum, equipped him with dental supplies and local anaesthetics sufficient for bush work. Beadell carried out his first extraction in March 1958 on Cyril Koch, a cook, during construction of the Gunbarrel Highway. By the time road building was completed in 1963, Len had pulled 29 teeth, joking that he had 29 notches on his forceps.

==Legacy==

Len Beadell marked &quot;astrofixes&quot; along his roads with aluminium plates on which latitude, longitude and other information was stamped. Many of these have sadly been taken as souvenirs; there is a program underway to replace these with replicas. Len&#x27;s legacy is also to be seen on many standard Australian road maps of central desert areas, showing such things as &quot;Len Beadell&#x27;s Tree&quot;, and &quot;Len Beadell&#x27;s Burnt Out Truck&quot;. Mount Beadell in Western Australia was formally named after him by the Surveyor General of Western Australia in 1958. There is a stone cairn, memorial plaque, and a replica of his theodolite atop the mountain. 

In modern times a newer road, the Great Central Road, has superseded some of Beadell&#x27;s original tracks by taking a more direct route, made possible with more modern heavy equipment. However, all of Len&#x27;s original roads still exist, and are popular with hardcore four wheel drive enthusiasts. They may be difficult to negotiate and require a great deal of preparation.
Almost all of them lie in aboriginal lands which require travel permits.

He was a good caricaturist and watercolour artist. He drew cartoons of staff working at Maralinga and paintings of Aboriginal people who came to the Maralinga camps.

The Beadell family sell books and memorabilia, and his daughter operates a bush tour business.

Beadell Resources, an Australian resources exploration company formed in 2007 and mostly active in remote Western Australia, named after &quot;The Last Australian Explorer&quot;.

<doc id="645513" wikidata="Q1418789" url="?curid=645513" title="Fire Island">
<text>Fire Island is the large center island of the outer barrier islands parallel to the South Shore of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York.

Occasionally, the name is used to refer collectively to not only the central island, but also Long Beach Barrier Island, Jones Beach Island, and Westhampton Island, since the straits that separate these islands are ephemeral. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy once again divided Fire Island into two islands. Together, these two islands are about long and vary between wide. The land area of Fire Island is .

Fire Island is part of Suffolk County. It lies within the towns of Babylon, Islip, and Brookhaven, containing two villages and several hamlets. All parts of the island not within village limits are part of the Fire Island census-designated place (CDP), which had a permanent population of 777 at the 2020 census, though that expands to thousands of residents and tourists during the summer. The neighborhoods of Cherry Grove and Fire Island Pines are known as gay-friendly tourist destinations.

==History==
===Etymology===
The origin of Fire Island&#x27;s name is uncertain. It is believed its Native American name was (&quot;Land of the Secatogues&quot;). The Secatogues were a tribe in the area of the current town of Islip. It was part of what was also called the &quot;Seal Islands&quot;.

The name of Fire Island first appeared on a deed in 1789.

Historian Richard Bayles suggests that the name derives from a misinterpretation or corruption of the Dutch word (&quot;five&quot;), or in another version (&quot;four&quot;), referring to the number of islands near the Fire Island inlet, a view echoed by Robert Caro, who suggests in &quot;The Power Broker&quot; that the island was named to reflect four inlets that have since disappeared. At times histories have referred to it in the plural, as &quot;Fire Islands&quot;, because of the inlet breaks.

Other versions say the island derived its name from fires built on the sea&#x27;s edge by Native Americans or by pirates to lure unsuspecting ships into the sandbars. Another version says that coastal guards, looking out for ships during WW2, lit fires as a signal when they ran out of supplies so that they could get more delivered from the mainland. Some say it is how portions of the island look to be on fire from sea in autumn. Yet another version says it comes from the rash caused by poison ivy on the island.

While the western portion of the island was referred to as Fire Island for many years, the eastern portion was referred to as Great South Beach until 1920, when widespread development caused the whole land mass to be called Fire Island.

===Settlement===
Indigenous Native Americans lived on Long Island and Fire Island for many centuries before Europeans arrived. There exists a myth that the islands were occupied by &quot;thirteen tribes&quot; &quot;neatly divided into thirteen tribal units, beginning with the Canarsie who lived in present-day Brooklyn and ending with the Montauk on the far eastern end of the island.&quot; But modern ethnographic research indicates that before the European invasion, Long Island and Fire Island were occupied by &quot;indigenous groups [...] organized into village systems with varying levels of social complexity. They lived in small communities that were connected in an intricate web of kinship relations [...] there were probably no native peoples living in tribal systems on Long Island until after the Europeans arrived. [...] The communities appear to have been divided into two general culture areas that overlapped in the area known today as the Hempstead Plains [...]. The western groups spoke the Delaware-Munsee dialect of Algonquian and shared cultural characteristics such as the longhouse system of social organization with their brethren in what is now New Jersey and Delaware. The linguistic affiliation of the eastern groups is less well understood [...] Goddard [...] concluded that the languages here are related to the southern New England Algonquian dialects, but he could only speculate on the nature of these relationships [...]. Working with a few brief vocabulary lists of Montauk and Unquachog, he suggested that the Montauk might be related to Mohegan-Pequot and the Unquachog might possibly be grouped with the Quiripi of western Connecticut. The information on the Shinnecock was too sparse for any determination [...] The most common pattern of indigenous life on Long Island prior to the intervention of the whites was the autonomous village linked by kinship to its neighbors.&quot;

&quot;Most of the &#x27;tribal&#x27; names with which we are now familiar do not appear to have been recognized by either the first European observers or by the original inhabitants until the process of land purchases began after the first settlements were established. We simply do not know what these people called themselves, but all the ethnographic data on North American Indian cultures suggest that they identified themselves in terms of lineage and clan membership. [...] The English and Dutch were frustrated by this lack of structure because it made land purchase so difficult. Deeds, according to the European concept of property, had to be signed by identifiable owners with authority to sell and have specific boundaries on a map. The relatively amorphous leadership structure of the Long Island communities, the imprecise delineation of hunting ground boundaries, and their view of the land as a living entity to be used rather than owned made conventional European real estate deals nearly impossible to negotiate. The surviving primary records suggest that the Dutch and English remedied this situation by pressing cooperative local sachems to establish a more structured political base in their communities and to define their communities as &quot;tribes&quot; with specific boundaries [...] The Montauk, under the leadership of Wyandanch in the mid-seventeenth century, and the Matinnecock, under the sachems Suscaneman and Tackapousha, do appear to have developed rather tenuous coalitions as a result of their contact with the English settlers.&quot;

&quot;An early example of [European] intervention into Native American political institutions is a 1664 agreement wherein the East Hampton and Southampton officials appointed a sunk squaw named Quashawam to govern both the Shinnecock and the Montauk.&quot;
* William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith held title to the entire island in the 17th century, under a royal patent from Thomas Dongan. The remnants of Smith&#x27;s Manor of St. George are open to the public in Shirley, New York. &quot;On May 25, 1691 Col. William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith purchased from the Indian, John Mayhew the enormous acreage, later to be known as the Manor of St. George. He then set aside 175 acres of the land occupied by the Unkechaug Indians on the west side of the Mastic (Forge) River at Poosepatuck Creek to be theirs for the annual rent of two ears of corn. The Poosepatuck Indian Reservation is still in existence today, however it has shrunk to 55 acres due to unscrupulous land dealings by early officials.&quot;
* The first large house was built in 1795 in Cherry Grove by Jeremiah Smith. Smith was said to have lured ships to their doom and killed the crews.
* In the early 19th century when slavery in New York was still legal, slave runners built stockades on the island by the Fire Island Inlet.
* The first Fire Island Lighthouse was built in 1825 and was replaced by the current lighthouse in 1858.
* In 1855, David S. S. Sammis bought near the Fire Island Lighthouse and built the Surf Hotel at what today is Kismet. Sammis operated the hotel until 1892, when the state took it over. In 1908, it became the first state park on Long Island.
* In 1868, Archer and Elizabeth Perkinson bought the land around Cherry Grove and Fire Island Pines. They built a hotel in 1880.
* In 1887, the Life-Saving Service established 11 staffed lifesaving stations on the island.
* In 1892, troops were called out to suppress a potential riot at Democrat Point over a cholera panic.
* In 1908, Ocean Beach was established, followed by Saltaire in 1910.
* In 1921, the Perkinsons sold the land around Cherry Grove in small lots. Bungalows from the newly closed Camp Upton in Yaphank were ferried over the Great South Bay to build the new community. Duffy&#x27;s Hotel was built in 1930.
* The Great Hurricane of 1938 devastated much of the island and made it appear undesirable to many. However, Duffy&#x27;s Hotel remained relatively undamaged. According to legend, the gay population began to concentrate in Cherry Grove at Duffy&#x27;s Hotel with Christopher Isherwood and W. H. Auden dressed as Dionysus and Ganymede and carried aloft on a gilded litter by a group of singing followers. The gay influence was continued in the 1960s when male model John B. Whyte developed Fire Island Pines. The Pines currently has some of the most expensive property on the island and accounts for two-thirds of the island&#x27;s swimming pools.
* In 1964, Robert Moses built the Captree Causeway to the western end of the island. Opponents, fearing that this was the beginning of plans for the continuation of Ocean Parkway, which would have run down the middle of the island, organized and eventually stopped the parkway.
* In September 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed a bill creating Fire Island National Seashore.

===As gay village===
When New York&#x27;s artistic bohème began frequenting Fire Island during the Jazz Age, Ocean Beach became the locale&#x27;s first gay village. Tensions between the gay (often famous) tourists and locals peaked when Antoine de Paris built an outhouse, complete with a revealing saloon door, on his land across the street from a Catholic church. Villagers arranged a provocation by sending a teenage boy to &quot;seduce&quot; one of Antoine&#x27;s guests, and after catching the guest &quot;in flagrante&quot;, they burned down Antoine&#x27;s property. After the Great Hurricane of 1938 devastated the island, the middle class moved to Saltaire, while the gay community settled in Cherry Grove.

Both Cherry Grove and Fire Island Pines were established gay enclaves by the 1950s, connected by a notorious cruising area nicknamed the Meat Rack. The party-filled culture of the pre-HIV/AIDS 1970s is portrayed in Andrew Holleran&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Dancer from the Dance&quot;. The Botel (today the Grove Hotel) was gay-friendly and ran popular afternoon &quot;tea dances&quot;. Cherry Grove calls itself &quot;America&#x27;s First Gay and Lesbian Town&quot;. Fire Island has &quot;an iconic gay scene&quot; and the Grove Hotel is New York State&#x27;s only hotel that prohibits those under 21 on the premises; this is legal because the hotel&#x27;s entrance is through a bar.

=== 2009: Beach renourishment ===
A 2009 beach renourishment program was credited with saving the island from the full effects of Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

In the winter and spring of 2009, a beach renourishment project was undertaken on Fire Island, with the cooperation of the National Park Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Towns of Brookhaven and Islip, and Fire Island residents. The program involved dredging sand from an offshore borrow area, pumping it onto the beach, and shaping the sand into an approved beach face and dune template in front of the communities of Corneille Estates, Davis Park, Dunewood, Fair Harbor, Fire Island Pines, Fire Island Summer Club, Lonelyville, Ocean Bay Park, Ocean Beach, Saltaire, and Seaview. Fire Islanders agreed to a significant property tax increase to help pay for the project, which was estimated to cost between $23 and $25 million ($6,020 per housing unit), including the cost of environmental monitoring, and was expected to add of sand in front of the participating communities. The Towns of Brookhaven and Islip, in which the communities are located, issued bonds to pay for the project, backed by the new taxes levied by community Erosion Control Taxing Districts.

===2012: Hurricane Sandy===
The island was heavily damaged by the high tides associated with Hurricane Sandy in 2012, including three breaches around Smith Point County Park on the sparsely populated eastern end of the island. The biggest breach, and politically the most difficult one to deal with because it is in a wilderness area, is at Old Inlet in the Otis Pike Wilderness Area just west of Smith Point County Park. Old Inlet is at the site of previous breaches (which have come and gone on their own) and was wide after the storm on the south end and on February 28, 2013. Officials have been debating whether to close the breach and let nature take its course, as it has been flushing out the Great South Bay and improving water quality. But residents of the bayfront communities noted increased flooding after the storm. This was later found to be the result of several nor&#x27;easters and unrelated to the breaches. As of 2018, the breach remained open. Officials have moved to close the other two breaches, which are on either side of Moriches Inlet—one in Cupsogue County Park and the other in Smith Point County Park.

Reports indicated that 80 percent of the homes, particularly those on the east end, were flooded, and 90 homes were completely destroyed. The storm also tore away about 75 feet of the dune coastline. But Fire Island was not hit as hard as other areas, with most of the 4,500 homes on the island surviving even if damaged, and significant home reconstruction has taken place. Officials credited the dune replenishment program with helping to spare the island.

==Geography==

Fire Island lies on average off the South Shore of Long Island, but nearly touches it along the East End. It is separated from Long Island by the Great South Bay, which spans interconnected bays along Long Island: Patchogue Bay, Bellport Bay, Narrow Bay, and Moriches Bay.

The island and its resort communities are accessible by boat, seaplane, and a number of ferries, which run across the bay from Patchogue, Bay Shore, and Sayville, to more than 10 points on the island.

The island is accessible by automobile near each end: via Robert Moses Causeway on its western end, and by William Floyd Parkway (Suffolk County Road 46) near its eastern end. Motor vehicles are not permitted on the rest of the island, except for utility, construction and emergency access and with limited beach-driving permits in winter.

Fire Island is located at 40°39′35″ north, 73°5′23″ west (). According to the United States Census Bureau, it has a land area of .

In 1834, Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler, a Swiss-American surveyor, measured at Fire Island the first baseline of the Survey of the Coast, shortly before Louis Puissant declared to the French Academy of Sciences in 1836 that Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre Méchain had made errors in the meridian arc measurement, which had been used to determine the length of the metre.

===Historical modifications===
The island&#x27;s physical attributes have changed over time, and continue to change. At one point it stretched more than from Jones Beach Island to Southampton.

Around 1683, Fire Island Inlet broke through, separating it from Jones Beach Island.

The Fire Island Inlet grew to in width before receding. The Fire Island Lighthouse was built in 1858, right on the inlet, but Fire Island&#x27;s western terminus at Democrat Point has steadily moved west so that the lighthouse today is from the inlet.

Fire Island separated from Southampton in a 1931 Nor&#x27;easter when Moriches Inlet broke through. The inlet widened on September 21, 1938. Moriches Inlet and efforts by local communities east of Fire Island to protect their beachfront with jetties have led to an interruption in the longshore drift of sand going from east to west and are blamed for erosion of the Fire Island beachfront. Between these major breaks there have been reports over the years of at least six inlets that broke through the island but have since disappeared.

==Landmarks and preserves==

Except for the western of the island, the island is protected as part of Fire Island National Seashore. Robert Moses State Park, occupying the remaining western portion of the island, is one of the popular recreational destinations in the New York City area. The Fire Island Light stands just east of Robert Moses State Park.

A memorial to TWA 800, dedicated in June 2002, is on the eastern end, at Smith Point County Park, near where the airplane crashed at sea.

==Inhabitants==

Fire Island&#x27;s population varies seasonally. There are few residents in winter months, with the population rising in the late spring to early fall.

Housing is mostly stick-built bungalow-style with generous helpings of bamboo. Some are beachfront, built on the dunes of the Atlantic Ocean, while others are on boardwalks or concrete walks, like a miniaturized city. For year-round residents, there are schools, churches, shops and even a school bus service to the mainland of Long Island via an off-road modified school bus.

The quiet villages on Fire Island provide solitude, while the larger towns provide a more social atmosphere with clubs, bars and open air dining. Two of these, Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove, are destinations for LGBTQ vacationers.

The incorporated villages of Ocean Beach and Saltaire within Fire Island National Seashore are car-free during the summer tourist season (Memorial Day through Labor Day) and permit only pedestrian and bicycle traffic (during certain hours only in Ocean Beach). For off-season use, there are a limited number of driving permits for year-round residents and contractors. The hamlet of Davis Park allows no vehicles or bicycles year-round.

In 1992 Diane Ketcham of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that due to the lack of retail, entertainment, and television options, especially in the winter, area children often felt bored and therefore felt excited to attend school.

==Emergency services==
Fire Island&#x27;s unique location and constantly changing geography play a major role in the protection of its citizens. Although it is served by ten fire departments and two police departments, the seasonal residency and remote driving distance are a challenge to the public safety community. Because there are no roads on inhabited Fire Island, fire department vehicles are heavily modified four-wheel drive with suspension lifts, large diameter off-road tires and recovery equipment, which allow them to traverse the sometimes washed-out, loose sand.

Until 1986, there was no ambulance service on Fire Island, prompting the village of Saltaire to form its rescue company, later followed by Ocean Beach, and then in the 2000s with Fair Harbor. Due to relatively close distances, fire departments on Fire Island are obliged to provide mutual aid to neighboring communities. Some coastal fire departments on Long Island have fully equipped marine rescue and fireboat units which can cross the Great South Bay to provide necessary assistance.

Fire Island&#x27;s corps of off-road-capable fire apparatus and the firefighters&#x27; training to use them effectively provide much-needed support in the event of a wildfire, as was illustrated in the Long Island Central Pine Barrens fires of 1995.

Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center, Southside Hospital, and Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center are located directly across the Great South Bay from Fire Island in the Long Island hamlets of West Islip, Bay Shore, and the village of Patchogue, respectively. A heliport for medevac helicopter use is adjacent to Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center. Specially equipped boats provided by the Suffolk County Police Department Marine Bureau docked at the various communities on Fire Island provide emergency transportation to individuals in need of dire medical care. In many cases, Long Island based ambulances will meet the boats once they cross the Bay (roughly 4.5 miles) and then drive individuals the short distance to one of the three hospitals. Also, one emergency access road connects Long Island (West Islip) to Fire Island (Kismet). However, the road ends there and does not extend the full length of the island into the other communities.

The Suffolk County Police Department Marine Bureau is the primary law enforcement agency. Ocean Beach also has its own dedicated police department. Criminal proceedings are handled by Suffolk District Court, and arrestees go to the 3rd, 1st or 5th precinct, or to one of the Suffolk County Sheriff&#x27;s Office jails. Small claims and property matters are usually handled by the individual village of case origin. It is common practice for police to write tickets then send unruly visitors off the island via water taxi, at the offender&#x27;s expense.

The Suffolk County Park Police and New York State Park Police patrol the Robert Moses State Park, while the National Park Service is stationed at the Fire Island Light and Fire Island National Seashore.

The United States Coast Guard has a base on Fire Island and provides aerial and nautical patrols to the Fire Island National Seashore as well as all beaches in the area. One of the oldest Coast Guard stations in America, Station No. 25 has been in uninterrupted operation since 1849.

==Education==
School districts that cover the island include:

<text>Øystein Aarseth (22 March 1968 – 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian musician and a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder and guitarist of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem and was the only constant member from the band&#x27;s formation in 1984 until his death in 1993. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete.

Euronymous professed to being a theistic Satanist and was known for making extreme misanthropic statements. He presented himself as leading a militant cult-like group known as the &quot;Black Metal Inner Circle&quot;.

In August 1993, he was murdered by fellow musician and former bandmate Varg Vikernes.

==Biography==

===1984–1991===
Aarseth formed Mayhem in 1984 along with bassist Necrobutcher (Jørn Stubberud) and drummer Kjetil Manheim. At the time he was going by the stage name Destructor but later changed his name to Euronymous, derived from the demon Eurynomos which inspired the Hellhammer song of the same name.

In summer 1986, Euronymous, Necrobutcher and Jon &quot;Metalion&quot; Kristiansen visited the German thrash metal band Assassin and recorded the &quot;Metalion in the Park&quot; demo under the name Checker Patrol, Metalion contributing background vocals to the title song &quot;Metalion in the Park&quot;.

In 1988, Per &quot;Dead&quot; Ohlin became Mayhem&#x27;s vocalist and Jan Axel &quot;Hellhammer&quot; Blomberg became its drummer. By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near Kråkstad, which was used as a place for the band to rehearse. Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous &quot;got on each other&#x27;s nerves a lot&quot; and &quot;weren&#x27;t really friends at the end&quot;. Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun. Varg Vikernes claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.

On 8 April 1991, Dead was found deceased by Euronymous at his home with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. His death was considered suicide. Before calling the police, Euronymous went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after rearranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: &quot;The Dawn of the Black Hearts&quot;. Necrobutcher recalls how Euronymous told him of the suicide:Øystein called me up the next day ... and says, &quot;Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself&quot;. I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, &quot;Relax, I have photos of everything&quot;. I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, &quot;OK. Don&#x27;t even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures&quot;.

Euronymous used Dead&#x27;s suicide to foster Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;evil&quot; image and claimed Dead had killed himself because black metal had become &quot;trendy&quot; and commercialized. In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead&#x27;s brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull. The band later denied the former rumor but confirmed that the latter was true. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Bård &quot;Faust&quot; Eithun, and Metalion. Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson of Marduk also confirmed this and that he also owns a piece of Dead&#x27;s brain matter as well as lead from the shotgun shot, all which were gifted to him by Euronymous.

Necrobutcher later speculated that taking the photographs and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend dead. He claimed that Euronymous &quot;went into a fantasy world&quot;. Faust of Emperor believes that Dead&#x27;s suicide &quot;marked the point at which, under Euronymous&#x27; direction, the black metal scene began its obsession with all things satanic and evil&quot;. Kjetil Manheim said that, after the suicide, Euronymous &quot;tried to be as extreme as he had talked about&quot;. The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before the suicide, and his behavior afterwards. Thus, after the suicide, Mayhem was left with only two members: guitarist Euronymous and drummer Hellhammer. Stian &quot;Occultus&quot; Johannsen was recruited as Mayhem&#x27;s new singer and bassist. However, this was short-lived; he left the band after receiving a death threat from Euronymous.

===1991–1993===

During May–June 1991, Euronymous opened a record shop named &quot;Helvete&quot; (Norwegian for &quot;hell&quot;) at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. Norwegian black metal musicians often met in the shop&#x27;s basement, including the two members of Mayhem, the members of Emperor, Varg &quot;Count Grishnackh&quot; Vikernes of Burzum, and Snorre &quot;Blackthorn&quot; Ruch of Thorns. Euronymous also started an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. It released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, and Swedish bands Merciless and Abruptum. Euronymous, Varg and Emperor guitarist Tomas &quot;Samoth&quot; Haugen all lived at Helvete at various times. Emperor drummer Faust also lived and worked there. The shop&#x27;s walls were painted black and bedecked with medieval weapons, posters of bands and picture discs, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.

According to Occultus, the space that Euronymous rented &quot;was far too big and the rent was too high. That&#x27;s the reason why it never did well&quot;. Only a small part of the building was used for the shop itself. Nevertheless, it became the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Metalion, writer of the fanzine &quot;Slayer&quot;, said that the opening of Helvete was &quot;the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene&quot;. Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,
Within just a few months [of Helvete opening], many young musicians had become obsessed with Euronymous and his ideas, and soon a lot of Norwegian death metal bands transformed into black metal bands. Amputation became Immortal, Thou Shalt Suffer turned into Emperor, and Darkthrone swapped their Swedish-inspired death metal for primitive black metal. Most notoriously, Old Funeral&#x27;s guitar player Kristian (later renamed as Varg) Vikernes had already left the band to form his own creation, Burzum.

Euronymous helped many younger bands in the scene, especially Emperor and Enslaved, both of whom he recommended to Candlelight Records. Ihsahn of Emperor said that &quot;if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted&quot; by the Helvete scene. Euronymous took Vikernes, who was five years younger than him, under his wing: inviting him to play bass with Mayhem and offering to release his music as Burzum. However, it has been claimed that their friendship turned to rivalry. Looking back, Faust said: &quot;It sounds really silly, but I think there was a little bit of a contest between them to see who could be more evil. It created a very difficult situation, especially for Euronymous, who wanted the glamour and the showbiz. With him, there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire&quot;.
On 6 June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen was destroyed by arson. Vikernes was strongly suspected as the culprit but was never convicted. There followed a wave of church burnings across Norway perpetrated by musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene. Euronymous was present at the burning of Holmenkollen Chapel together with Vikernes and Faust, who were convicted for the arson after Euronymous was dead. Faust says he believes that Euronymous got involved because he &quot;felt he had to prove that he could be a part of it and not just in the background&quot;. To coincide with the release of Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;, Vikernes and Euronymous had allegedly plotted to bomb Nidaros Cathedral, which appears on the album cover. Euronymous&#x27; death in August 1993 put an end to this plan and stalled the album&#x27;s release. In a 1993 interview on a Swedish radio show, Euronymous said of the church burnings:They [Christians] must feel that there is a dark, evil power present that they have to fight, which…will make them more extreme. We also believe that when a church burns it&#x27;s not only Christians who suffer, but people in general. Imagine a beautiful old stave church...what happens when it burns? The Christians feel despair, God&#x27;s house is destroyed and ordinary people will suffer from grief because something beautiful was destroyed. So you end up spreading grief and despair, which is a good thing.

In January 1993, an article in one of Norway&#x27;s biggest newspapers, &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot;, brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Varg Vikernes (using his pseudonym Count Grishnackh) gave an anonymous interview to a journalist from the newspaper, in which he claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Vikernes himself was released in March 1993, also for lack of evidence. That month, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; published an article about the Norwegian black metal scene. In it, Euronymous and Vikernes presented themselves as leaders of a militant, cult-like group of &quot;Satanic terrorists&quot;. Euronymous claimed that Helvete helps fund its activities, but said that he is not directly involved in its crimes, because if he were caught the organization would fall apart.

After the &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot; episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media. Vikernes and the authors of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; claim that Euronymous&#x27; parents pressured him into shutting Helvete.

===Murder===
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, as well as between Euronymous and some members of the Swedish black metal scene.

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death at his apartment in Oslo. The murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media. It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records (Euronymous owed Vikernes a large sum of royalty payments), or an attempt at &quot;outdoing&quot; the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes claims that he killed Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up, and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: &quot;If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn&#x27;t have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me&quot;. He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.

On the night of the murder, Vikernes and Snorre &quot;Blackthorn&quot; Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous&#x27; apartment at Tøyengata in Oslo. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous&#x27; apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door to hand him the signed contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous &quot;panicked&quot; and kicked him in the chest. Vikernes claims Euronymous ran into the kitchen to fetch a knife. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found in the stairwell on the first floor with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous&#x27; wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. This claim of self-defense is doubted by Faust, while Necrobutcher believes Vikernes killed Euronymous due to the death threats he received from him. Necrobutcher also intended to murder Euronymous himself due to him tastelessly capitalizing on Dead&#x27;s suicide.

Blackthorn claims Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. He claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. Blackthorn said of the murder, &quot;I was neither for nor against it. I didn&#x27;t give a shit about Øystein&quot;. Vikernes, however, claims that he had not planned the killing and that Blackthorn came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs.

====Aftermath====
Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial, it was claimed that Vikernes, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes&#x27; credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway&#x27;s maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, &quot;presumably as a statement of symbolic support&quot;. Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice. Vikernes was released from prison on parole in 2009.

At Euronymous&#x27; funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem&#x27;s drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem&#x27;s former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; album. Before the release, Euronymous&#x27; family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: &quot;I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was rerecording the bass parts, but I never did&quot;. The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.

A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used Satan to provoke. They saw Euronymous&#x27; death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers &quot;have sworn to avenge Aarseth&#x27;s death&quot;. A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said, &quot;There&#x27;s no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop&quot;. After his death, a &quot;cult developed around the memory of Euronymous&quot;, and he was hailed by some as &quot;the King&quot; or &quot;Godfather of Black Metal&quot;.

A new generation of musicians also tried to gain credibility by riding on the back of his legacy. However, many of Euronymous&#x27; friends and bandmates &quot;speak of the killing with a tone of indifference&quot;. &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; remarks: &quot;what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another&quot;. In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous&#x27; death either did not affect them or did not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences&quot;. He added: &quot;I think many people felt relief once he was gone&quot;. Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying, &quot;Nobody was there to boss them about. The &#x27;black metal police&#x27; were gone&quot;.

==Beliefs and personality==
The book &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; says of Euronymous:

In interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. In a 1992 interview, he said &quot;The hardcore [punk] pigs have correctly made themselves guardians of morality, but we must kick them in the face and become guardians of anti-morality&quot;. The following year, he told &quot;Kill Yourself&quot; zine, &quot;There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted&quot; and claimed &quot;I have no problem with killing someone in cold blood&quot;. Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985 and considered him his best friend) said Euronymous &quot;was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme&quot;. Euronymous&#x27; shop attracted a lot of new young fans, many of whom looked up to and even idolized him.

However, some who knew Euronymous claim that &quot;the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that—a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality&quot;. They include Necrobutcher, Kjetil Manheim, Vikernes and Blackthorn. Faust said that with Euronymous, &quot;there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire&quot;. When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: &quot;I think that was very much to create fear among people&quot;. He added that the scene &quot;wanted to be in opposition to society&quot; and &quot;tried to concentrate more on just being &#x27;evil&#x27; than having a real Satanic philosophy&quot;. Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (Euronymous&#x27; friend from 1983 until his death) described him as &quot;health oriented ... A nice guy, a family guy&quot;, but said that when his older friends were not around, &quot;he could play out his role&quot;. Manheim claimed that Euronymous became &quot;extreme&quot; towards the end of his life: &quot;He liked telling people that they were worthless; that he was the best. He was all &#x27;I define black metal. Black metal is me!&#x27; ... I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a megalomaniac&quot;. In the documentary &quot;Pure Fucking Mayhem&quot;, he said &quot;Øystein&#x27;s daily life was a total theater&quot; that was based on the black metal &quot;archetype&quot; of Euronymous.

===Religion===
In interviews, Euronymous said he was a theistic Satanist.
In an interview by Esa Lahdenperä conducted in August 1993, Euronymous stated:

The theistic Satanism espoused by Euronymous was an inversion of Roman Catholic dogma, and he claimed &quot;We praise the evil and we believe blindly in a godly creature just like a Christian&quot;. On the relationship between religion and science, he said: &quot;Scientists can&#x27;t disprove [...] religion. No matter how hard you try, you can&#x27;t explain the universe. You can&#x27;t leave out a religious belief.&quot;

He opposed the Satanic and occultist teachings of Anton LaVey and Aleister Crowley, for unlike Euronymous, they promoted what he saw as &quot;peace&quot; and commercial frivolity, as well as individualism in contrast to dogma. He said he would &quot;never accept any band which preaches Church of Satan ideas, as they are just a bunch of freedom and life-loving atheists, and they stand exactly the opposite of me&quot;. When asked what he thought of Crowley&#x27;s code of &quot;do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law&quot;, he answered, &quot;People shall do what WE want them to do. We&#x27;re against freedom, and forced a band from Rogaland in Norway—Belsebub—to split up.&quot;

As noted earlier, some of those who knew Euronymous claim that his &quot;extreme Satanic image&quot; was an act. While Mortiis said that Euronymous &quot;was such a devil worshipper you wouldn&#x27;t believe it&quot;, in the black metal documentary &quot;Until the Light Takes Us&quot;, Varg Vikernes claimed that Euronymous was not a Satanist. He said: &quot;To Aarseth everything was about image and he wanted to appear extreme. He wanted people to think of him as being extreme; the most extreme of them all. But he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;be&quot; extreme and he wasn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; extreme&quot;. While Metalion, who was friends with both Vikernes and Euronymous when the latter died, and called Euronymous his best friend, wrote that &quot;some people in our scene read a few books and considered themselves Satanists&quot;, he made no such statements about Euronymous. Tenebris (allegedly Jon Nödtveidt) from the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, a Swedish Satanic order formed in 1995, wrote that &quot;back then, in 1991, things mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism [...] and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in &#x27;93&quot;.

Over time, some members of the Norwegian scene began to follow Paganism. Vikernes later claimed that Euronymous—&quot;obsessed with this &#x27;Satanist&#x27; thing&quot;—disapproved of Vikernes promoting paganism. Euronymous showed no explicit disapproval of paganism though, and released the pagan band Enslaved&#x27;s first album, &quot;Vikingligr Veldi&quot;, on Deathlike Silence Productions.

===Black metal and death metal===
Euronymous said that the term &quot;black metal&quot; can apply to any kind of metal so long as it is &quot;Satanic&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot;. He said, &quot;If a band cultivates and worships Satan, it&#x27;s black metal&quot;, and that &quot;in a way, it can be ordinary heavy metal or just noise. What&#x27;s important is that it&#x27;s Satanic; that&#x27;s what makes it black metal&quot;. He rejected bands like Immortal being called black metal, &quot;as they are not Satanists&quot;, but supported the band nonetheless. As noted earlier, bands who had LaVeyan beliefs were also rejected. When it was pointed out that Venom (the band that coined the term &quot;black metal&quot;) only used Satanism as a gimmick, Euronymous said that he and the Black Circle &quot;choose to believe otherwise&quot;.

Likewise, Euronymous said that the term death metal can apply to any kind of metal, so long as the band &quot;cultivates and worships death&quot;. Euronymous lamented the commercialization and loss of extremity within death metal. He said &quot;Real Death Metal should be something normal people are afraid of, not something mothers can listen to&quot;, and &quot;Death Metal is for brutal people who are capable of killing, it&#x27;s not for idiotic children who want to have [a] funny hobby after school&quot;.

Like many others in the black metal scene, Euronymous originally believed that black metal should stay underground. However, he later changed his mind. He believed that the idea of staying underground came from hardcore punk, and said, &quot;Those who scream most about being in &#x27;underground&#x27; is also often those who make so bad music that they don&#x27;t have a chance to get big themselves&quot;. He added: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don&#x27;t change my ways of thinking and being. [...] If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well. The bigger we get, the more we can manipulate people into thinking like us&quot;.

===Politics===
Euronymous was interested in totalitarian communist states such as the Soviet Union under Stalin and Romania under Ceaușescu. He collected Eastern Bloc memorabilia, and in the 1980s, he was a member of the Norwegian communist youth group Rød Ungdom, which was Marxist–Leninist at the time. He left Rød Ungdom, allegedly because he came to realise that they were &quot;just a bunch of humanists&quot;. He said &quot;as I hate people I don&#x27;t want them to have a good time, I&#x27;d like to see them rot under communist dictatorship&quot;. He had a fascination with the idea of mass surveillance, secret police and forced disappearance. Mayhem&#x27;s Attila Csihar said Euronymous was not a communist &quot;in the political sense&quot; but was fascinated by the power communist dictators had over their people.

Hellhammer said &quot;Euronymous wanted to be the most extreme person, and he thought that communism was very extreme&quot;, but that he later claimed to be a fascist. In a private letter written in the early 1990s, Euronymous claimed that &quot;almost all&quot; Norwegian black metal bands at the time were &quot;more or less Nazis&quot;, including Mayhem. He did not, however, use the music of Mayhem to promote any kind of politics.

==Instruments==
Euronymous&#x27; main guitar was a sunburst Gibson Les Paul Standard guitar, which he can be seen playing in many pictures. He played through a slightly modified 1981 Marshall Super Lead amplifier and used a Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive pedal, as well as a Boss HM-2 Heavy Metal pedal.

==Influences==
He stated in various interviews that his and Mayhem&#x27;s main influences were Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer, Sodom and Destruction, whilst he also liked Iron Maiden, Kiss, Celtic Frost, Dio and Metallica.

==Legacy==
Euronymous is considered one of the creators of Norwegian black metal&#x27;s guitar style, alongside Snorre &quot;Blackthorn&quot; Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns. In the documentary &quot;Helvete: Historien om norsk black metal&quot;, Snorre Ruch credits him with inventing a new way of tremolo picking that allowed to play the iconic black metal arpeggio riff, going slowly up and down a chord doing the tremolo picking in each string.
He was also ranked No. 51 out of &quot;The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot; by &quot;Guitar World&quot;.

In March 2012, low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle set up a public poll asking customers to pick a famous Norwegian historic figure whose picture would decorate the aircraft&#x27;s tail fin. Largely on the strength of international fans, Aarseth was leading the poll, but his name was removed from the campaign at his family&#x27;s request.

The 2018 film &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, based on the eponymous book, is a semi-fictionalised account of the early 1990s Norwegian black metal scene told from the perspective of Euronymous. In the film Euronymous is played by Rory Culkin.

==Discography==
Euronymous played guitar on the following albums except where noted, any additional instruments or credits in notes.

<text>The Thirtynine Mile volcanic area, part of the larger Central Colorado volcanic field, is an extinct volcanic area located in Park and Teller counties, Colorado, northwest of Cripple Creek and southeast of South Park. The area was the site of significant volcanism in the Paleogene Period about 35 million years ago. Ashfall and lahars (mudflows) from the volcanoes created the conditions for fossilization at what is now Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument.

The Thirtynine Mile volcanic area is the northern reach of an extensive Eocene to Oligocene volcanic belt. The volcanic fields in this belt include, from north to south, the Thirtynine Mile and San Juan in Colorado, the Mogollon-Datil in New Mexico, the Boot Heel in the bootheel of southwestern New Mexico and adjacent areas of Arizona and Mexico, the Trans-Pecos of west Texas, the Eastern Chihuahua and the vast volcanic field of the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Mexico. These volcanic fields, this volcanic belt, resulted from the subduction of the Farallon plate under the North American Plate.

The area is named for Thirtynine Mile Mountain, a local peak that is composed of volcanic rocks from the field. The area also contains the Guffey volcanic eruption center.

<doc id="645521" wikidata="Q1757622" url="?curid=645521" title="New Radicals">
<text>New Radicals (stylized as Иew Radicals) was an American pop rock band formed in 1997 in Los Angeles. The band was centered on the duo of Gregg Alexander (lead vocals, guitar, songwriting, production) and Danielle Brisebois (keyboards, percussion, backing vocals), and augmented by session and touring musicians.

The band released only one album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot;, heavily influenced by the rock and soul of the 1970s, containing—among radio-friendly modern rock tracks and love songs—strong criticism of corporate America. The band is known for their debut single &quot;You Get What You Give&quot;. The song topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand, became a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom, and was in the top 40 in the US.

Tired of touring and promotional interviews, Alexander disbanded the group in mid-1999 before the release of their second single, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&quot;, to focus on writing and producing songs for other artists. Alexander and Brisebois&#x27; songwriting partnership continued following the disbanding of the group, with the two being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2015 for their composition &quot;Lost Stars&quot; from the film &quot;Begin Again&quot;.

Since their disbandment, the group has received numerous offers for a reunion tour or new album, but Alexander has repeatedly turned these down. New Radicals did however reunite for a one off performance on January 20, 2021 to mark President Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential inauguration. They came together again in support of the Democratic National Convention in August 2024, releasing two newly-recorded versions of &quot;Lost Stars&quot; and &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;.

==Members==
Alexander and Brisebois had recorded solo albums prior to the formation of New Radicals: Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Michigan Rain&quot; (1989) and &quot;Intoxifornication&quot; (1992), and Brisebois&#x27; &quot;Arrive All Over You&quot; (1994). Brisebois had been a child actress in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and had portrayed the character of Stephanie Mills on the sitcoms &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. Alexander and Brisebois had co-written most of the songs on &quot;Arrive All Over You&quot;, and Brisebois had appeared as a backing vocalist on &quot;Intoxifornication&quot;.

Most of the musicians who worked on &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot; were friends of Alexander and Brisebois, including piano player Paul Gordon, drummers Matt Laug and Josh Freese, guitarist Rusty Anderson, guitarist Michael James (who also mixed the band&#x27;s music); bassists Paul Bushnell, Dan Rothchild and John Pierce; percussionist Lenny Castro, pianist Greg Phillinganes, and producer Rick Nowels. Nowels also played piano on two songs on the album (and who had previously produced Alexander&#x27;s debut album &quot;Michigan Rain&quot;).

Other musicians who were at some point part of the live line-up include drummer Stuart Johnson, guitarist Bradley Fernquist, keyboardist Jim McGorman and bassist Sasha Krivtsov. The latter two were later part of the house band in &quot;Rock Star: INXS&quot;. Sasha and Jim also played with KISS&#x27; Paul Stanley on his &quot;Live To Win&quot; solo tour in 2006.

==History==

===Rise to mainstream fame===
New Radicals were formed in Los Angeles in 1997 by Gregg Alexander, who had previously released two unsuccessful solo albums, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Michigan Rain&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Intoxifornication&quot;. Michael Rosenblatt, MCA Records&#x27; A&amp;R Senior Vice President, signed the band in December 1997, and Alexander received a $600,000 advance for their first (and only) album, &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot;. The album was released on October 20, 1998, and was well received by music critics, who praised the record for its wide range of atypical influences for a modern pop rock album, such as Todd Rundgren, World Party, and Hall &amp; Oates. The reviewers compared its funk and soul-influenced upbeat pop rock to the early work of Prince and Mick Jagger.

Some critics disliked the album&#x27;s themes, dismissing Alexander&#x27;s criticism of society and the frequent references to drugs and sex that run throughout the album as &quot;shallow posturing&quot; and &quot;empty social pronouncements&quot;, while others stated that these criticisms &quot;would sound clichéd if they so insightful and articulated with such uninhibited truth.&quot; Popular opinion, by contrast, pushed the album to No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the U.S., where it also achieved platinum status (1,000,000 copies sold). It was also certified gold in the United Kingdom (100,000 copies sold) and in Canada (50,000 copies sold).

===&quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot;===

To promote their album, New Radicals embarked on a tour through the United States, starting in late 1998. Apart from many concerts and festivals, the tour also included several live performances on the radio, appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;All That&quot; and a performance at the House of Blues in Chicago on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1998—which is probably the only New Radicals show of which bootlegs are circulating. They also opened for the Goo Goo Dolls on their tour starting on March 30, 1999. They were known to play &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; twice per set.

The album was followed on November 17, 1998, by the release of their first single, &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; (co-written with Rick Nowels), which reached No. 36 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 1 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Singles Chart. The song received heavy radio airplay and rotation on MTV and much media attention. In large part this attention focused on the celebrity-slamming line &quot;Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson / Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson / You&#x27;re all fakes run to your mansions / Come around we&#x27;ll kick your ass in.&quot;

When asked about it in an interview, Marilyn Manson replied he was &quot;not mad that [Alexander] said he&#x27;d kick my ass, I just don&#x27;t want to be used in the same sentence with Courtney Love&quot; and would &quot;crack his skull open if I see him.&quot; Beck reported that &quot;I was in a grocery store and he [Alexander] came running up to me, so apologetic, and saying, &#x27;I hope you weren&#x27;t offended. It wasn&#x27;t supposed to be personal.&#x27; I was kind of pleased, because he&#x27;s a big guy.&quot; The members of Hanson said they weren&#x27;t really bothered by the song; they saw it as just a pop-culture reference. They also co-wrote the song &quot;Lost Without Each Other&quot; from their 2004 album &quot;Underneath&quot; with Alexander. Zac Hanson said that &quot;It was cool working with Gregg... [he]&#x27;s definitely a character but he&#x27;s a cool guy.&quot;

Following the mass media&#x27;s excitement about the celebrity insults, Alexander explained that the verse, along with the lines directly preceding it (&quot;Health insurance rip off lying / FDA big bankers buying / Fake computer crashes dining / Cloning while they&#x27;re multiplying&quot;) were an experiment to see if the media would focus on the real issues, or on the celebrity ridicule. Similar complaints and attacks on Christian religion, American society, politics and corporations can be found in other songs on the album as well, and Alexander would often use promotional interviews to talk about these topics, complaining about—among other things—corrupt, greedy politicians and corporate officers, credit card interest, the poor American social security system, and lack of education.

The drums on the album&#x27;s title track were sampled from the XTC song &#x27;All of a Sudden&#x27; (from their &quot;English Settlement&quot; album). According to XTC&#x27;s songwriter Andy Partridge, the sample was used without permission; and the band and its record company eventually received £70,000 in compensation for its use.

===Breakup and post–New Radicals===
When the band canceled their appearance at the Atlanta open-air music festival RockFest, as well as their UK tour (scheduled to start on May 17, 1999), rumors started they would break up, while MCA Records claimed an unspecified member of the band being ill was the cause for the canceled shows. New Radicals went on to shoot the video for their second single &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&quot;; however, less than two weeks before its release, Gregg Alexander issued a press release on July 12, announcing the breakup of the group. Alexander said that New Radicals &quot;will no longer be a recording, promoting, or performing entity&quot; and that he would focus on producing and writing material for other artists. He went on to say that he &quot;accomplished all of [his] goals with this record&quot; and that &quot;the fatigue of traveling &amp; getting three hours sleep in a different hotel every night to do boring &#x27;hanging and schmoozing&#x27; with radio and retail people, is definitely not for [him]&quot;, that he &quot;lost interest in fronting a &#x27;One Hit Wonder&#x27; to the point that [he] was wearing a hat while performing so that people wouldn&#x27;t see [his] lack of enthusiasm&quot; and that he would go on to form a production company to focus on producing and writing songs freelance for other artists. His first production work after New Radicals&#x27; breakup was the album &quot;Portable Life&quot; by fellow Radical Danielle Brisebois, originally set to be released in October 1999, but cancelled by RCA Records until eventually being released digitally almost a decade later in September 2008. Given the band&#x27;s breakup and the resulting lack of promotion, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&quot; failed to have a notable impact on the charts (it did not chart the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached only No. 28 on the U.S. Adult Top 40 and No. 48 on the UK Singles Chart)

Although no third single was released, there are some (conflicting) clues as to what would have been the third single: certain promotional copies of &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot; come with a sticker reading &quot;includes &#x27;You Get What You Give&#x27;, &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Die Anymore&#x27; and &#x27;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&#x27;&quot;, suggesting that &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Die Anymore&quot; would join the other two as a single release. Several websites selling the album also marked the track as &quot;Album Version&quot;, indicating that there would be a single version at some point. However there also exist copies of &quot;Mother We Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; as both a one-track promotional single and as a four-track commercial single with a barcode. Apparently they never made it to retail and were probably test pressings.

In addition to the songs released on the United States version of &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot;, two studio songs by New Radicals were produced. The song &quot;To Think I Thought&quot; was included as the B-side to &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; and as an additional track on the Japanese version of the album, and &quot;The Decency League&quot; was a B-side to the single &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&quot;.

In the years following New Radicals&#x27; breakup, Alexander worked with artists including Ronan Keating, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Enrique Iglesias; he often collaborated with producer/songwriter Rick Nowels. His most successful song as a producer/songwriter was the 2003 Grammy Award-winning &quot;The Game of Love&quot; by Santana and Michelle Branch. Rod Stewart also recorded Alexander and Nowels&#x27; &quot;I Can&#x27;t Deny It&quot; for his 2001 album &quot;Human&quot;.

In 2003, a new Gregg Alexander song titled &quot;A Love Like That&quot; was released at PickTheHits.com, a website where users could rate new music. While it was uncredited, fans immediately recognized Alexander&#x27;s voice and parts of the lyrics that had already appeared in the booklet for &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot;. The song was (as official sites listing Alexander&#x27;s song repertoire reveal) written by Alexander and Nowels.

===2021 and 2024 reunions===
New Radicals reunited on January 20, 2021, to perform &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; as part of the Inauguration of Joe Biden. The song was used by Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27;s husband, Doug Emhoff, during 2020 campaign rallies, and was referred to by Joe Biden in his autobiography, &quot;Promise Me, Dad&quot;, as his family&#x27;s &quot;rallying &#x27;theme song&#x27;&quot; during his late son Beau Biden&#x27;s terminal battle with glioblastoma. Alexander said that he hopes the group&#x27;s performance of the song can be a &quot;tiniest beacon of light in such a dark time&quot;. Alexander told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he was unable to reunite the original New Radicals touring band for the performance due to COVID-19-related restrictions, and he and Brisebois were instead accompanied by musicians from the Philadelphia area.

Two new singles by New Radicals were released on August 23, 2024: A version of &quot;Lost Stars&quot;, co-written by Alexander and Brisebois for the 2014 film &quot;Begin Again&quot;, and a version of &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, an Alexander co-composition that was originally released by Sophie Ellis-Bextor in 2001.

==Usage in media==

Since their breakup, New Radicals&#x27; songs have been used for several commercials and trailers (for example the trailer to 1999&#x27;s &quot;Big Daddy&quot; with Adam Sandler, the 2001 film &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;, the 2011 American musical comedy film &quot;The Muppets&quot;, and the 2006 film &quot;Click&quot;), TV shows (like &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Community&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, and &quot;Daria&quot;), on soundtracks (such as &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Click&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;) and covered by artists such as Mandy Moore and Jon Foreman (lead singer of Switchfoot) and Hall &amp; Oates (both covered &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&quot;–Moore and Foreman on the soundtrack to &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, Hall &amp; Oates on their 2003 album &quot;Do It For Love&quot;). Ronan Keating also covered the song during his 2002 Destination Everywhere tour and included &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; in his celebrity playlist on iTunes, as did Joni Mitchell on her &quot;Artist&#x27;s Choice&quot; CD, released by Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music. She also declared New Radicals &quot;the only thing I heard in many years that I thought had greatness in it... I loved that song &#x27;You Get What You Give.&#x27; It was a big hit, and I said, &#x27;Where did they go?&#x27; It turns out the guy [Gregg Alexander] quit. I thought, &#x27;Good for him.&#x27; I knew he was my kind of guy.&quot; In 2012, &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; was covered in the season three finale episode of &quot;Glee&quot;.

In 2005, LMC performed a remix of &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; under the title &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot;. A new version of the remix, with new vocals by Rachel McFarlane replacing the samples from the original version, was released in January 2006 as a single under the song&#x27;s original title. The remix with new vocals peaked at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart. Shawnna&#x27;s 2006 song &quot;Chicago&quot; from the album &quot;Block Music&quot; samples the opening line from Moore and Foreman&#x27;s version of &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&quot;. In 2013, Brooklyn-based pop rock duo Savoir Adore covered &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; as part of season four of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s web series &quot;A.V. Undercover&quot;.

<text>Isaac Israel Hayes (March 5, 1832 – December 17, 1881) was an American Arctic explorer, physician, and politician, who was appointed as the commanding officer at Satterlee General Hospital during the American Civil War, and was then elected, after the war, to the New York State Assembly.

His book, &quot;The Open Polar Sea: A Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery towards the North Pole, in the Schooner United States&quot;, was published in 1867.

==Formative years and Arctic exploration==

Isaac Israel Hayes was born on March 5, 1832, in Chester County, Pennsylvania, to Benjamin Hayes. He was raised on his family&#x27;s farm before being sent to the coeducational Westtown School, which had been founded in Chester County in 1799 by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Electing to remain there for two years following his graduation, he became an assistant teacher of civil engineering and mathematics. In 1851, he sought and received admission to the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. After graduating from Penn a year ahead of schedule, he then signed on as ship&#x27;s surgeon for the Second Grinnell Expedition of 1853–1855. Led by Elisha Kane, the project&#x27;s members left New York harbor in June 1853 in search of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition.

While still engaged with Kane&#x27;s expedition, Hayes and another team member succeeded in making a round trip exploration of the east coast of Ellesmere Island north of the 79th parallel (79° north). Traveling by sledge, they were able to improve mapping of the area by documenting the features of of previously uncharted coastline, an effort which helped future Arctic explorers, and reportedly made Hayes the first non-aboriginal explorer of Ellesmere. When Kane announced his plans to extend the expedition for a second winter even though the group&#x27;s food and fuel were severely depleted, Hayes and seven other team members opted to head south for what they thought would be safety. Instead, they ran out of food and began to eat the only available food source – lichen – until forced to return to Kane&#x27;s main group, where Hayes then underwent the amputation of three of his frostbitten toes before Kane ordered the group to head to Greenland via sledge and boat. After reaching New York in October 1855 and recuperating from the ordeal, Hayes then embarked on a lecture tour, speaking before audiences at the American Geographical Society and Smithsonian Institution and eventually becoming &quot;the most prolific lecturer and writer on the Arctic in the nineteenth century,&quot; according to biographer Douglas Wamsley.

===American Arctic Expedition===

Hayes led his own Arctic expedition from 1860 to 1861 and was able to raise $30,000 for his venture. Departing in June 1860 aboard the &quot;United States&quot;, he ultimately hoped to reach the North Pole. After arriving in Greenland, he encouraged several indigenous people to join his 20-man party as hunters to ensure that his crew would not be forced to endure the hunger and starvation experienced by previous expeditions. Hayes and his men then set out for Baffin Bay, Smith Sound and Ellesmere Island en route to the Open Polar Sea but, like others before him, was eventually forced by the terrain, harsh climate and dwindling food supplies to turn back. Taking a measurement with his sextant before making the turnaround, he recorded that he and his men had reached 81°35&#x27; north, 70°30&#x27; west — which, if his measurement was accurate, would have meant that he and his men had reached the farthest point north to date of any polar expedition. His journal entries did not match the position he had written down in the frigid cold, however, leading subsequent researchers to conclude that he had overestimated his reach by more than , and to speculate that Hayes may have mistakenly noted that his sextant observations of the sun had been taken at noon when they hadn&#x27;t or that he had inverted the second digit of the group&#x27;s farthest lone lower limb to read 56°52′ instead of the true observation 59°52′. According to researchers, the farthest point reached by Hayes was Cape Collinson, less than north of 80° north, longitude 70°30′ west.

Believing that they had achieved at least part of their objectives, Hayes and his team reached Greenland only to learn that their nation had descended into Civil War.

==American Civil War==
 After returning to the United States, Hayes enrolled as a surgeon with the Union Army. In 1862, he was placed in command of the Satterlee General Hospital, a sprawling 4,500-bed military hospital in Philadelphia which saw spikes in patients following the Second Battle of Bull Run and Battle of Gettysburg, the latter of which was responsible for &quot;swelling the hospital population to more than 6,000&quot; after &quot;the greatest number of wounded were admitted to the hospital in a single month&quot; during the summer of 1863.

Rendering care to as many as 50,000 sick and wounded during the time this hospital was open, the physicians and nurses under Hayes lost only 260 patients between the time of the hospital&#x27;s opening and closure, a significant achievement when considering the challenges they faced in treating not only the sheer volume of patients they were required to process, but in doing so while employing relatively rudimentary medical care procedures and sanitation practices.

==Post-war life==
After the war, Hayes penned a book about his expedition days, &quot;The Open Polar Sea: A Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery towards the North Pole, in the Schooner United States&quot;. He then followed up with the publication of other work, including 1869&#x27;s &quot;Cast Away in the Cold&quot;. On November 23, 1874, a reception was held in Hayes&#x27; honor at the Arcadian Club during which General Roy Stone spoke about Hayes&#x27; accomplishments. In 1863, Hayes was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

===Service in the New York State Assembly===
Hayes then ran for, and was elected to the New York State Assembly. Representing New York City as a Republican from 1876 until 1881, he worked to improve the quality of life for poor and mentally ill members of society, and joined his fellow State Assembly members, the Hon. Harvey J. Hurd of Erie, and the Hon. Thomas J. Alvord of Onondaga, in proposing an amendment to the New York State Constitution on February 27, 1878, to abolish canal tolls as a way of facilitating business growth and general prosperity in the region.

An &quot;anti-Tammany Hall Republican,&quot; he also secured the support of his colleagues in funding construction of a tunnel beneath the Hudson River which, when completed roughly a decade later as the Hudson River Tunnel, significantly improved the efficiency of East Coast transportation by linking Manhattan to New Jersey.

===Death and interment===
On Friday evening, December 18, 1881, while still a sitting member of the State Assembly, the 49-year-old Hayes suffered a heart attack at his home in New York City. He died the following morning.

==Honors==
 In 1865, Hayes&#x27; expedition was memorialized in Frederic Edwin Church&#x27;s painting &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;. During his expedition, Hayes had named a peak at 81°16&#x27;N, 65°35&#x27;W &quot;Church&#x27;s Peak&quot; after his friend Church, and gave his own sketch of it (now in the collection of Olana State Historic Site) to the artist; Church used it as a reference for the peak that appears in his &quot;Aurora Borealis,&quot; and painted Hayes&#x27; ship &quot;United States&quot; in the foreground. Church also produced a portrait oil sketch of Oosisoak, Hayes&#x27; lead sled dog, in 1861 (now in a private collection).

In addition to Hayes&#x27; commemoration of his expedition by naming the range on Canada&#x27;s Ellesmere Island after his ship, the &quot;United States&quot;, one of Russia&#x27;s Franz Josef Land&#x27;s islands, Heiss Island (a German cartographer&#x27;s transliteration of Hayes Island) was also named in his honor.

<doc id="645530" wikidata="Q2095206" url="?curid=645530" title="Pilot signal">
<text>In telecommunications, a pilot signal is a signal, usually a single frequency, transmitted over a communications system for supervisory, control, equalization, continuity, synchronization, or reference purposes.

== Uses in different communication systems ==
=== FM Radio ===
 In FM stereo broadcasting, a pilot tone of 19 kHz indicates that there is stereophonic information at 38 kHz (the second harmonic of the pilot tone). The receiver doubles the frequency of the pilot tone and uses it as a frequency and phase reference to demodulate the stereo information.

If no 19 kHz pilot tone is present, then any signals in the 23–53 kHz range are ignored by a stereo receiver. A guard band of ±4 kHz (15–23 kHz) protects the pilot tone from interference from the baseband audio signal (50 Hz–15 kHz) and from the lower sideband of the double sideband stereo information (23–53 kHz). The third harmonic of the pilot (57 kHz) is used for Radio Data System. The fourth harmonic (76 kHz) is used for Data Radio Channel.

=== AM Radio ===
In AM stereo, the bandwidth is too narrow to accommodate subcarriers, so the modulation itself is changed, and the pilot tone is infrasonic (below the normal hearing range, instead of above it) at a frequency of 25 Hz.

=== Television ===
In some color television standards, the color burst placed after every sync pulse on visible lines (as done in PAL and NTSC) is the pilot signal to indicate that there are color subcarriers present and allow synchronizing the phase of the local oscillator in the demodulation circuitry. However, SECAM features continuous subcarriers which don&#x27;t need their phase tracked due to being frequency-modulated as compared to the QAM approach of the other systems, thus making it unnecessary.

In the NTSC television system, a pilot tone of MHz (15,734.27 Hz) is used to indicate the presence of MTS stereo. 

=== Video Recording ===
In some analog video formats frequency modulation is the standard method for recording the luminance part of the signal, and is used to record a composite video signal in direct color systems, e.g. Video 2000 and some Hi-band formats a pilot tone is added to the signal to detect and correct timebase errors.

=== Cable ===
In cable service plant infrastructures, two or more pilot frequencies are used to allow network amplifiers to automatically adjust their gain over temperature swings. This is done by the amplifiers having special circuitry that track the frequencies in order to maintain a consistent gain. Without this capability, network amplifiers may drive the signal too strongly or weakly, thus requiring constant adjustment. Pilot frequencies can be generated by an agile modulator, taking the space of analog NTSC channels, or by dedicated equipment. Sometimes it is necessary to employ several independent pilot frequencies. Most radio relay systems use radio or continuity pilots of their own but transmit also the pilot frequencies belonging to the carrier frequency multiplex system.

<doc id="645533" wikidata="Q2705092" url="?curid=645533" title="Formula One racing">
<text>A Formula One Grand Prix is an auto racing event which takes place over three days (usually Friday to Sunday), with a series of practice and qualifying sessions prior to the race on Sunday. Current regulations provide for two free practice sessions on Friday, a morning practice session and an afternoon qualifying session held on Saturday, and the race held on Sunday afternoon or evening, although the structure of the weekend has changed numerous times over the history of the sport. Historically, the Monaco Grand Prix held practice on Thursday rather than Friday (up to and including ), and the whole schedule for the Las Vegas (starting from its inaugural event in ), Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix (in only) is brought forward by one day. At most Formula One race weekends, other events such as races in other Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) series, such as Formula 2 or Formula 3, are held.

== Free practice ==

Since 2006, three free practice sessions (often abbreviated to FP1, FP2, and FP3) are held before the race. The first is typically held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon, while the third session is typically on Saturday morning. From , all sessions last for one hour; prior to this, the Friday sessions were 90 minutes in length and the Saturday session was one hour in length. In addition in 2021, cars are now put under &quot;parc fermé&quot; conditions after the third practice session instead of qualifying. Private tests are now heavily restricted, but a third driver (such as a reserve, test, or junior driver) is permitted to take part in the first Friday free practice session in the place of a regular driver. The second practice session for the Bahrain, Singapore and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix takes place in the evening, as these races are run at night. All practice sessions for the Las Vegas Grand Prix were held at night, with the first two on Thursday, the third and qualifying on Friday and the race held on Saturday.

== Qualifying ==

A qualifying session is held before each race to determine the order cars will be lined up in at the start of the race, with the fastest qualifier starting at the front and the slowest at the back. Drivers who could not set a time for any reason are also relegated to the back.

=== Historical methods ===
Traditionally before , qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday (Thursday at Monaco) afternoon from 13:00 to 14:00 local time, with the second held on Saturday afternoon at the same time. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards their final grid position. Each driver was limited to twelve laps per qualifying session.

In 1996, qualifying was amended with the Friday qualifying session abolished in a favour for a single qualifying session held on Saturday afternoon. As previously, each driver was limited to twelve laps with the inclusion of a 107% rule to exclude drivers with slow lap times. This was calculated by using the time of the driver on pole position and adding on 7% to create a cut-off time. This format remained until the conclusion of the 2002 season. Between and , the qualifying session was run as a one-lap session and took place on Friday and Saturday afternoon with the cars running one at a time. In 2003, the Friday running order was determined with the leader of the Drivers&#x27; Championship heading out first. The Saturday running order was determined by times set in Friday afternoon qualifying with the fastest heading out last and the slowest running first. No refuelling was allowed between the start of Saturday qualifying and the start of the race, so drivers qualified on race fuel. The lap times from the Friday afternoon session did not determine the grid order.

In 2004, the Friday session was moved to Saturday. The running order for the first session was now based on the result of the previous race. At first both sessions were held back-to-back, but the first session was later moved earlier in the day. At the start of 2005, the sessions were held on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Lap times from both sessions were counted to give the overall aggregate position. From the 2005 European Grand Prix onwards, the Sunday morning session was dropped for a single run on Saturday afternoon having proved unpopular with drivers, teams and broadcasters. The running order was the reverse of the previous race result.

=== Current format ===
Since , qualifying takes place on Saturday afternoon in a three-stage &quot;knockout&quot; system. One hour is dedicated to determining the grid order, divided into three periods with short intermissions between them. Since 2010, the first qualifying period (Q1) is eighteen minutes long, with all twenty cars competing. At the end of Q1, the five slowest drivers are eliminated from further qualification rounds, and fill positions sixteen to twenty on the grid based on their fastest lap time. Any driver attempting to set a qualifying time when the period ends is permitted to finish their lap, though no new laps may be started once the chequered flag is shown. After a short break, the second period (Q2) (15 minutes long) begins, with fifteen cars on the circuit. At the end of Q2, the five slowest drivers are once again eliminated, filling grid positions eleven to fifteen. Finally, the third qualifying period (Q3) (12 minutes long) features the ten fastest drivers from the second period. The drivers are issued a new set of soft tyres and have twelve minutes to set a qualifying time, which will determine the top ten positions on the grid. The driver who sets the fastest qualifying time is said to be on pole position, the grid position that offers the best physical position from which to start the race.

Drivers may complete as many laps as they choose within the permitted qualifying session&#x27;s time. As of the 2022 season, all drivers are permitted to start the race on the tyre of their choice regardless of their grid position, whereas previously it was required for the drivers starting in the top 10 grid positions to start on the same tyre as the one that they set their fastest lap time within the second qualifying session. Generally, a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track in order to get to the start/finish line (the &quot;out-lap&quot;). Having crossed the line, they will attempt to achieve the quickest time around the circuit that they can in one or more laps (the &quot;flying lap&quot; or &quot;hot lap&quot;). This is the lap time which is used in calculating grid position. Finally, the driver will continue back around the track and re-enter the pit lane (the &quot;in-lap&quot;); however, this is merely strategy, and no teams are obliged by the rules to follow this formula, as drivers may elect to set several flying laps before returning to the pits. For the first two races of the 2016 season, a modified format was used where drivers were eliminated during the sessions rather than just at the end and only eight drivers progressed to the final session. Qualifying reverted to the previous format from the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix onwards.

==== Sprint qualifying ====
Following the decision to make sprints standalone from 2023 onwards, sprints were given a dedicated qualifying session, dubbed in 2023 &quot;sprint shootout&quot; and &quot;sprint qualifying&quot; in 2024. The format of sprint shootout is the same as qualifying, but with the three segments (dubbed &quot;SQ1&quot;, &quot;SQ2&quot; and &quot;SQ3&quot; instead of &quot;Q1&quot;, &quot;Q2&quot; and &quot;Q3&quot;) being shorter at 12 minutes, 10 minutes and 8 minutes, instead of 18, 15 and 12 minutes. Initially, new tyres were mandatory for each phase, with mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3. This was changed for the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix to allow teams the ability to use any set of soft tyres, be it new or used, for SQ3, after Lando Norris could not run in SQ3 at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, after exhausting his allocation of soft tyres.

=== Qualifying requirements ===
As of , ten teams are entered for the Formula One World Championship, each entering two cars for a total of twenty cars. The regulations place a limit of twenty-six entries for the championship. At some periods in the history of Formula One the number of cars entered for each race has exceeded the number permitted, which historically would vary from race to race according to the circuit used; Monaco, for example, for many years allowed only twenty cars to compete because of the restricted space available. The slowest cars excess to the circuit limit would not qualify for the race and would be listed as &#x27;Did not qualify&#x27; (DNQ) in race results.

==== Historical pre-qualifying ====
There had been pre-qualifying sessions in the late 1970s, but during the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of cars attempting to enter each race was as high as thirty-nine for some races. Because of the dangers of having so many cars on the track at the same time, pre-qualifying sessions were re-introduced for the teams with the worst record over the previous twelve months, including any new teams. Usually, only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed into the qualifying session proper, where thirty cars competed for twenty-six places on the starting grid for the race. The slowest cars from the pre-qualifying session were listed in race results as &#x27;Did Not Pre-Qualify&#x27; (DNPQ). Pre-qualifying was discontinued after the 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix when many small teams withdrew from the sport.

==== 107% rule ====

As the number of cars entered in the world championship fell below twenty-six, a situation arose in which any car entered would automatically qualify for the race, no matter how slowly it had been driven. The 107% rule was introduced in to prevent completely uncompetitive cars being entered in the championship. If a car&#x27;s qualifying time was not within 107% of the pole sitter&#x27;s time, that car would not qualify for the race, unless at the discretion of the race stewards for a situation such as a rain-affected qualifying session. For example, if the pole-sitter&#x27;s time was one minute and forty seconds, any car eligible for racing had to set a time within one minute and forty-seven seconds.

The 107% rule was removed in since the FIA&#x27;s rules indicated previously that 24 cars could take the start of a Formula One race, and a minimum of twenty cars had to enter a race. In , the qualifying procedure changed to a single-lap system, rendering the rule inoperable. However, there were concerns about the pace of the new teams in the 2010 season. As the qualifying procedure had been changed since the 2006 season to a three-part knockout system, the rule could now be reintroduced. As such, the 107% rule was reintroduced in the 2011 Formula One season. Currently, cars eliminated in Q1 have to be within 107% of the fastest Q1 time in order to qualify for the race.

Since the rule was re-introduced, only twice have cars failed to qualify for a Grand Prix – both times involving Hispania Racing cars and both times occurring at the Australian Grand Prix, namely in 2011 (Vitantonio Liuzzi and Narain Karthikeyan) and 2012 (Karthikeyan and Pedro de la Rosa). At their discretion, stewards may permit a driver who fails to set a qualifying time within the desired 107% span to enter the race; for example, at the 2018 British Grand Prix, Lance Stroll and Brendon Hartley both failed to set times within 107%, but were permitted to race on the grounds of satisfactory lap times in free practice. After eleven drivers failed to set satisfactory Q1 times at the 2016 Hungarian Grand Prix due to inclement weather, the regulations were amended in 2018 so that wet sessions were not subject to the 107% rule.

=== Grid penalties ===
Drivers or cars may be issued penalties against their starting positions, commonly for exceeding component limits, or sporting offences in free practice, qualifying, or a previous race. This can lead to the starting grid being significantly different from the qualifying order.

== Sprint ==

During the 2021 Formula One World Championship, Formula One trialed a &quot;sprint qualifying&quot; system at three Grands Prix – Britain, Italy, and São Paulo – in which the grid for the race on Sunday was determined by a 100 km sprint on Saturday. On a race weekend with sprint qualifying, the sessions on Friday, instead of regular two practice sessions, consisted of one practice session and a traditional qualifying session, which was limited to soft tyres and which set the grid for sprint qualifying. Only the winner of the sprint qualifying was considered to have taken pole position for the main Grand Prix, and they received a trophy similar to the pole position trophy awarded at other race weekends. The top three finishers in sprint qualifying in 2021 received World Championship points in a 3–2–1 scoring system. Formula One stuck with having sprints at three events, after initially planning to increase it to six events. These plans were abandoned after teams failed to agree on the cost-cap considerations for additional sprint events.

For 2022 season, &quot;sprint qualifying&quot; was renamed to &quot;sprint&quot;. The weekend format remained unchanged from 2021 and was run at the Emilia Romagna, Austrian, and São Paulo Grands Prix with points now awarded to the top eight finishers rather than the top three finishers as was the case in 2021. Unlike the 2021 season, the driver who set the fastest time in qualifying was credited as the official pole-sitter (unless penalised), with the winner of the sprint continuing to have the right to start the main race from the first-place grid position.

From 2023, standalone sprint events were implemented, meaning that the outcome of the sprint race would no longer set the grid for the main race. These plans were approved a few days before the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix – the first of the six events on the 2023 calendar to feature the sprint format. The format for sprint events in 2023 featured Friday consisting of a single practice session followed by the qualifying session which set the starting grid for the main race on Sunday; while Saturday featured a special qualifying session, named the sprint shootout, which set the grid for the sprint race (called the &quot;sprint&quot;) which was also held later on Saturday. The structure of the sprint weekends was changed again for 2024, with the goal of rationalising sprint events and separating them from the rest of the Grand Prix weekend. The sprint shootout, which sets the starting grid order for the sprint race, was moved to Friday afternoon after the weekend&#x27;s only practice session. The sprint will then be the first session to take place on Saturday, followed by qualifying for the main race. The Grand Prix itself remains on Sunday. For the first three seasons of the sprint format, there was a single parc fermé period starting from Friday&#x27;s Grand Prix qualifying session all the way through to the start of the Grand Prix. However, for 2024, there are two separate parc fermé periods: the first lasts from the start of sprint qualifying to the start of the Sprint and the second lasts from Saturday&#x27;s Grand Prix qualifying to the start of the Grand Prix itself. This is intended to allow teams to fine tune their cars between the end of the sprint and the start of Grand Prix qualifying.

== Race ==
The race itself is held on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of night races at Singapore, Bahrain, Qatar, Las Vegas, and Saudi Arabia and a day/night race for the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The Las Vegas Grand Prix was held on a Saturday, with the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix provisioned to move to a Saturday in 2024; prior to that, the last race not to take place on a Sunday was the 1985 South African Grand Prix, which took place on a Saturday.

=== Race start ===
Thirty minutes prior to race time, the cars take to the track for any number of warm-up laps (formally known as reconnaissance laps), provided they pass through the pit lane and not the grid, after which they assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. At the hour of the race, a green light signifies the beginning of the relatively slow formation lap during which all cars parade around the course doing a final tyre warmup and system checks. The cars then return to their assigned grid spot for the standing race start. The starting light system, which consists of five pairs of lights mounted above the start/finish line, then lights up each pair at one-second intervals. Once all five pairs are illuminated, after a random length of time between 0.2 and 3 seconds, the red lights are turned off by the race director, at which point the race starts. The race length is defined as the smallest number of complete laps that exceeds 305 kilometres (the Monaco Grand Prix is the sole exception with a race length of 78 laps / 260.5 km), though occasionally some races are truncated due to special circumstances. The race can not exceed two hours in length—if this interval is reached, the race will be ended at the end of the next full lap—unless the race is halted by a red flag, in which case the total time including the red flag stoppage must not exceed three hours, and the total time excluding the red flag stoppage may not exceed two hours. At the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, the three hour countdown was stopped with force majeure being cited.

=== Pit stops ===

Each driver is also required to use two different types of dry compound during a dry race, and so must make a mandatory pit stop. Timing pit stops with reference to other cars is crucial—if they are following another car but are unable to pass, the driver may try to stay on the track as long as possible, or pit immediately, as newer tyres are usually faster. Prior to the 2010 season, drivers used to make pit stops for fuel more than once during a race, as the cars on average traveled two kilometres per litre (approximately five miles per gallon). Nowadays this figure is higher, due to changes in engines from 2014, and as a result refuelling has been forbidden during a race since . If a driver starts the race using intermediate or wet tyres, they are not mandated to make a pit stop.

=== Podium ceremony ===
At the end of the race, the first, second and third-placed drivers take their places on a podium, where they stand as the national anthem of the race winner&#x27;s home country and that of their team is played. Dignitaries from the country hosting the race then present trophies to the drivers and a constructor&#x27;s trophy to a representative from the winner&#x27;s team, and the winning drivers spray champagne and are interviewed. The three drivers then go to a media room for a press conference where they answer questions in English and their native languages.

== Points system ==
=== Historical methods ===
Historically, the races were scored on the basis of a five-place tally: i.e. via an 8–6–4–3–2 scoring system, with the holder of the fastest race lap also receiving a bonus point. In 1961, the scoring was revised to give the winner nine points instead of eight, and the single point awarded for fastest lap was given for sixth place for the first time the previous year. In 1991, the points system was again revised to give the victor 10 points, with all other scorers recording the same 6–4–3–2–1 result. In 2003, the FIA further revised the scoring system to apportion points to the first eight classified finishers (a classified finisher must complete 90% of race distance) on a 10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1 basis.

At certain points between 1950 and 1990, drivers&#x27; points for the season would be tallied based on their best results across the World Championship, which varied from 4 to 11 in a season, and during the late 1960s and 1970s points would be tallied based on their best results from each half of the season, which varied from four to seven. This was done in order to equalise the footings of teams which may not have had the wherewithal to compete in all events. With the advent of the Concorde Agreements, this practice has been discontinued, though it did feature prominently in several world championships through the 1970s and 1980s, primarily in 1988 when Alain Prost scored a total of 105 points to Ayrton Senna&#x27;s 94, but due to only the best 11 results counting towards the World Championship, Senna won, with the final points tally being 90–87.

=== Current system ===

Points are awarded to drivers and teams based on where they finish in a race. The winner receives 25 points, the second-place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10, respectively. In a dead heat, prizes and points are added together and shared equally for all those drivers who tie. The winner of the annual championship is the driver (or team, for the Constructors&#x27; Championship) with the most points. If the number of points is the same, priority is given to the driver with more wins. If that is the same it will be decided on the most second places and so on.

<doc id="645537" wikidata="Q318896" url="?curid=645537" title="Gonadotropin-releasing hormone">
<text>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a releasing hormone responsible for the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. GnRH is a tropic peptide hormone synthesized and released from GnRH neurons within the hypothalamus. GnRH is inhibited by testosterone. The peptide belongs to gonadotropin-releasing hormone family. It constitutes the initial step in the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis.

== Structure ==
The identity of GnRH was clarified by the 1977 Nobel Laureates Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally:

pyroGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2
As is standard for peptide representation, the sequence is given from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus; also standard is omission of the designation of chirality, with assumption that all amino acids are in their L- form. The abbreviations are the standard abbreviations for the corresponding proteinogenic amino acids, except for &quot;pyroGlu&quot;, which refers to pyroglutamic acid, a derivative of glutamic acid. The &quot;NH2&quot; at the carboxyl terminus indicates that rather than terminating as a free carboxylate, it terminates as a carboxamide.

==Synthesis==
The gene, &quot;GNRH1&quot;, for the GnRH precursor is located on chromosome 8. In mammals, the linear decapeptide end-product is synthesized from an 89-amino acid preprohormone in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus. It is the target of various regulatory mechanisms of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, such as being inhibited by increased estrogen levels in the body.

== Function ==
GnRH is secreted in the hypophysial portal bloodstream at the median eminence. The portal blood carries the GnRH to the pituitary gland, which contains the gonadotrope cells, where GnRH activates its own receptor, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor that stimulates the beta isoform of Phosphoinositide phospholipase C, which goes on to mobilize calcium and protein kinase C. This results in the activation of proteins involved in the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH. GnRH is degraded by proteolysis within a few minutes.

GnRH activity is elevating during fetal life, drops briefly following birth due to the effect of placental hormones, then becomes elevated again for the first one to six months of life in a period known as minipuberty, during which time gonadotropins and sex steroids contribute to the development of sexual organs. GnRH is very low during childhood, and is reactivated at puberty during adolescence. During the reproductive years, pulse activity is critical for successful reproductive function as controlled by feedback loops. However, once a pregnancy is established, GnRH activity is not required. Pulsatile activity can be disrupted by hypothalamic-pituitary disease, either dysfunction (i.e., hypothalamic suppression) or organic lesions (trauma, tumor). Elevated prolactin levels decrease GnRH activity. In contrast, hyperinsulinemia increases pulse activity leading to disorderly LH and FSH activity, as seen in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). GnRH formation is congenitally absent in Kallmann syndrome.

===Control of FSH and LH===
At the pituitary, GnRH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These processes are controlled by the size and frequency of GnRH pulses, as well as by feedback from androgens and estrogens. Low-frequency GnRH pulses are required for FSH release, whereas high-frequency GnRH pulses stimulate LH pulses in a one-to-one manner.

There are differences in GnRH secretion between females and males. In males, GnRH is secreted in pulses at a constant frequency; however, in females, the frequency of the pulses varies during the menstrual cycle, and there is a large surge of GnRH just before ovulation.

GnRH secretion is pulsatile in all vertebrates, and is necessary for correct reproductive function. Thus, a single hormone, GnRH1, controls a complex process of follicular growth, ovulation, and corpus luteum maintenance in the female, and spermatogenesis in the male.

===Neurohormone===
GnRH is considered a neurohormone, a hormone produced in a specific neural cell and released at its neural terminal. A key area for production of GnRH is the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, which contains most of the GnRH-secreting neurons. GnRH neurons originate in the nose and migrate into the brain, where they are scattered throughout the medial septum and hypothalamus and connected by very long &gt;1-millimeter-long dendrites. These bundle together so they receive shared synaptic input, a process that allows them to synchronize their GnRH release.

The GnRH neurons are regulated by many different afferent neurons, using several different transmitters (including norepinephrine, GABA, glutamate). For instance, dopamine appears to stimulate LH release (through GnRH) in estrogen-progesterone-primed females; dopamine may inhibit LH release in ovariectomized females. Kisspeptin appears to be an important regulator of GnRH release. GnRH release can also be regulated by estrogen. It has been reported that there are kisspeptin-producing neurons that also express estrogen receptor alpha.

===Other organs===
GnRH is found in organs outside of the hypothalamus and pituitary, and its role in other life processes is poorly understood. For instance, there is likely to be a role for GnRH1 in the placenta and in the gonads. GnRH and GnRH receptors are also found in cancers of the breast, ovary, prostate, and endometrium.

==Effects of behavior==
GnRH production/release is one of the few confirmed examples in which behavior influences hormones, rather than the other way around. Cichlid fish that become socially dominant in turn experience an upregulation of GnRH secretion whereas cichlid fish that are socially subordinate have a down regulation of GnRH secretion. Besides secretion, the social environment as well as their behavior affects the size of GnRH neurons. Specifically, males that are more territorial have larger GnRH neurons than males that are less territorial. Differences are also seen in females, with brooding females having smaller GnRH neurons than either spawning or control females. These examples suggest that GnRH is a socially regulated hormone.

Multiple neuronal regions in the limbic system send signals to the hypothalamus to modulate the amount of GnRH production and the frequency of pulses. This provides a possible explanation for why psychic influences typically affect female sexual function.

==Medical uses==
Natural GnRH was previously prescribed as gonadorelin hydrochloride (Factrel) and gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate (Cystorelin) for use in treating human diseases. Modifications of the decapeptide structure of GnRH to increase half life have led to GnRH1 analog medications that either stimulate (GnRH1 agonists) or suppress (GnRH antagonists) the gonadotropins. These synthetic analogs have replaced the natural hormone in clinical use.

Its analogue leuprorelin is used for continuous infusion, to treat breast cancer, endometriosis, prostate cancer, and following research in the 1980s by researchers, including Dr. Florence Comite of Yale University, it was used to treat precocious puberty.

The expression of GnRH receptors in cancers has led to the use of GnRH as a targeting molecule to deliver toxins specifically to the receptor-expressing cancer cells. In a similar concept, its use to deliver toxins to pituitary gonadotropes in animals has been explored as a means of sterilization, with limited success. GnRH was also shown to successfully deliver DNA into the pituitary gonadotropes where the expressed protein blocked expression of the hormones that regulate reproduction.

A Cochrane Review is available which investigates whether GnRH analogues, given before or alongside chemotherapy, could prevent damage to women&#x27;s ovaries caused by chemotherapy. GnRH agonists appear to be effective in protecting the ovaries during chemotherapy, in terms of menstruation recovery or maintenance, premature ovarian failure and ovulation.

==Animal sexual behavior==
GnRH activity influences a variety of sexual behaviors. Increased levels of GnRH facilitate sexual displays and behavior in females. GnRH injections enhance copulation solicitation (a type of courtship display) in white-crowned sparrows. In mammals, GnRH injections facilitate sexual behavior of female display behaviors as shown with the musk shrew&#x27;s (&quot;Suncus murinus&quot;) reduced latency in displaying rump presents and tail wagging towards males.

An elevation of GnRH raises males&#x27; testosterone capacity beyond a male&#x27;s natural testosterone level. Injections of GnRH in male birds immediately after an aggressive territorial encounter results in higher testosterone levels than is observed naturally during an aggressive territorial encounter.

A compromised GnRH system has adverse effects on reproductive physiology and maternal behavior. In comparison to female mice with a normal GnRH system, female mice with a 30% decrease in GnRH neurons are poor caregivers to their offspring. These mice are more likely to leave their pups scattered rather than grouped together, and will take significantly longer to retrieve their pups.

==Veterinary use==
The natural hormone is also used in veterinary medicine as a treatment for cattle with cystic ovarian disease. The synthetic analogue deslorelin is used in veterinary reproductive control through a sustained-release implant.

==Other names==
As with many hormones, GnRH has been called by various names in the medical literature over the decades since its existence was first inferred. They are as follows:
* Gonadotropin-releasing factor (GnRF, GRF); Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, GRH)
* Follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing factor (FRF, FSH-RF); Follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone (FRH, FSH-RH)
* Luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (LRF, LHRF); Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LRH, LHRH)
* Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone–releasing factor (FSH/LH-RF); Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (FSH/LH-RH)
* Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone–releasing factor (LH/FSH-RF); Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone (LH/FSH-RH)

<text>Mariposite is a mineral which is a chromium-rich variety of mica, which imparts an attractive green color to the generally white dolomitic marble in which it is commonly found. It was named for Mariposa, California, United States, though it can be found in several other places in the Sierra Nevada. It is also found in Marblemount, Washington, in the North Cascades, as well as in a few locations in Newfoundland, Canada, where it is called virginite, and in Europe.

It is not an officially classified mineral, but is a chromium-rich phengite, which is a high silica variety of muscovite. It is the chromium that gives it its distinctive green color.

The term &quot;mariposite&quot; also refers to the stone in which the green mica is found. This stone is metamorphic rock, containing varying amounts of dolomite and quartz. Larger proportions of quartz give it a more attractive, translucent appearance. It is used as a decorative construction material, in walls, monuments, and bridges. It is also made into jewelry.

== Chemical composition ==
The chemical formula of mariposite is .

<text>Mount Carleton (), at , is the highest peak in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, and the Maritime Provinces. Located in Mount Carleton Provincial Park, it is one of the highlights of the Canadian portion of the International Appalachian Trail. Mount Carleton is also part of the eighth and final section of the Nepisiguit Mi&#x27;gmaq Trail. The mountain was named after Thomas Carleton, New Brunswick&#x27;s first lieutenant governor, and forms part of the Notre Dame Mountains chain, which is visible on Map 24 of the NB Atlas.

Before aerial surveillance was extensively used, a hut was maintained on the summit for fire-spotting in the remote north-central part of the province. A very similar hut was maintained on Big Bald Mountain. Triangulation among these huts and other fire towers allowed the locations of wildfires to be determined quickly and easily.

Mount Carleton is a monadnock, an erosional remnant of resistant igneous rocks that remained after an ancient Mesozoic peneplain surface was uplifted in the Cenozoic to form a plateau, and subsequently dissected via millions of years of erosion by wind, water and glacial ice. It consists of 400 million-year-old rhyolitic and basaltic volcanics.

<doc id="645554" wikidata="Q740686" url="?curid=645554" title="Synthetic-aperture radar">
<text>Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar that is used to create two-dimensional images or three-dimensional reconstructions of objects, such as landscapes. SAR uses the motion of the radar antenna over a target region to provide finer spatial resolution than conventional stationary beam-scanning radars. SAR is typically mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft or spacecraft, and has its origins in an advanced form of side looking airborne radar (SLAR). The distance the SAR device travels over a target during the period when the target scene is illuminated creates the large &quot;synthetic&quot; antenna aperture (the &quot;size&quot; of the antenna). Typically, the larger the aperture, the higher the image resolution will be, regardless of whether the aperture is physical (a large antenna) or synthetic (a moving antenna) – this allows SAR to create high-resolution images with comparatively small physical antennas. For a fixed antenna size and orientation, objects which are further away remain illuminated longer – therefore SAR has the property of creating larger synthetic apertures for more distant objects, which results in a consistent spatial resolution over a range of viewing distances.

To create a SAR image, successive pulses of radio waves are transmitted to &quot;illuminate&quot; a target scene, and the echo of each pulse is received and recorded. The pulses are transmitted and the echoes received using a single beam-forming antenna, with wavelengths of a meter down to several millimeters. As the SAR device on board the aircraft or spacecraft moves, the antenna location relative to the target changes with time. Signal processing of the successive recorded radar echoes allows the combining of the recordings from these multiple antenna positions. This process forms the &quot;synthetic antenna aperture&quot; and allows the creation of higher-resolution images than would otherwise be possible with a given physical antenna.

== Motivation and applications ==

SAR is capable of high-resolution remote sensing, independent of flight altitude, and independent of weather, as SAR can select frequencies to avoid weather-caused signal attenuation. SAR has day and night imaging capability as illumination is provided by the SAR.

SAR images have wide applications in remote sensing and mapping of surfaces of the Earth and other planets. Applications of SAR are numerous. Examples include topography, oceanography, glaciology, geology (for example, terrain discrimination and subsurface imaging). SAR can also be used in forestry to determine forest height, biomass, and deforestation. Volcano and earthquake monitoring use differential interferometry. SAR can also be applied for monitoring civil infrastructure stability such as bridges. SAR is useful in environment monitoring such as oil spills, flooding, urban growth, military surveillance: including strategic policy and tactical assessment. SAR can be implemented as inverse SAR by observing a moving target over a substantial time with a stationary antenna.

==Basic principle==

A &quot;synthetic-aperture radar&quot; is an imaging radar mounted on a moving platform. SAR is a Doppler technique. It is based on the fact that &quot;radar reflections from discrete objects in a passing radar beam field each [have] a minute Doppler, or speed, shift relative to the antenna&quot;.Carl Wiley, working at Goodyear, Arizona, (which later became Goodyear Aerospace, and eventually Lockheed Martin Corporation) in 1951, suggested the principle that — because each object in the radar beam has a slightly different speed relative to the antenna — each object will have its own doppler shift. A precise frequency analysis of the radar reflections will thus allow the construction of a detailed image.

In order to realise this concept, electromagnetic waves are transmitted sequentially, the echoes are collected and the system electronics digitizes and stores the data for subsequent processing. As transmission and reception occur at different times, they map to different small positions. The well ordered combination of the received signals builds a virtual aperture that is much longer than the physical antenna width. That is the source of the term &quot;synthetic aperture,&quot; giving it the property of an imaging radar. The range direction is perpendicular to the flight track and perpendicular to the azimuth direction, which is also known as the &quot;along-track&quot; direction because it is in line with the position of the object within the antenna&#x27;s field of view.

The 3D processing is done in two stages. The azimuth and range direction are focused for the generation of 2D (azimuth-range) high-resolution images, after which a digital elevation model (DEM) is used to measure the phase differences between complex images, which is determined from different look angles to recover the height information. This height information, along with the azimuth-range coordinates provided by 2-D SAR focusing, gives the third dimension, which is the elevation. The first step requires only standard processing algorithms, for the second step, additional pre-processing such as image co-registration and phase calibration is used.

In addition, multiple baselines can be used to extend 3D imaging to the &quot;time dimension&quot;. 4D and multi-D SAR imaging allows imaging of complex scenarios, such as urban areas, and has improved performance with respect to classical interferometric techniques such as persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI).

==Algorithm==
SAR algorithms model the scene as a set of point targets that do not interact with each other (the Born approximation).

While the details of various SAR algorithms differ, SAR processing in each case is the application of a matched filter to the raw data, for each pixel in the output image, where the matched filter coefficients are the response from a single isolated point target. In the early days of SAR processing, the raw data was recorded on film and the postprocessing by matched filter was implemented optically using lenses of conical, cylindrical and spherical shape. The Range-Doppler algorithm is an example of a more recent approach.

== Existing spectral estimation approaches ==

Synthetic-aperture radar determines the 3D reflectivity from measured SAR data. It is basically a spectrum estimation, because for a specific cell of an image, the complex-value SAR measurements of the SAR image stack are a sampled version of the Fourier transform of reflectivity in elevation direction, but the Fourier transform is irregular. Thus the spectral estimation techniques are used to improve the resolution and reduce speckle compared to the results of conventional Fourier transform SAR imaging techniques.

=== Non-parametric methods ===

==== FFT ====

FFT (Fast Fourier Transform i.e., periodogram or matched filter) is one such method, which is used in majority of the spectral estimation algorithms, and there are many fast algorithms for computing the multidimensional discrete Fourier transform. Computational &quot;Kronecker-core array algebra&quot; is a popular algorithm used as new variant of FFT algorithms for the processing in multidimensional synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) systems. This algorithm uses a study of theoretical properties of input/output data indexing sets and groups of permutations.

A branch of finite multi-dimensional linear algebra is used to identify similarities and differences among various FFT algorithm variants and to create new variants. Each multidimensional DFT computation is expressed in matrix form. The multidimensional DFT matrix, in turn, is disintegrated into a set of factors, called functional primitives, which are individually identified with an underlying software/hardware computational design.

The FFT implementation is essentially a realization of the mapping of the mathematical framework through generation of the variants and executing matrix operations. The performance of this implementation may vary from machine to machine, and the objective is to identify on which machine it performs best.

===== Advantages =====

* Additive group-theoretic properties of multidimensional input/output indexing sets are used for the mathematical formulations, therefore, it is easier to identify mapping between computing structures and mathematical expressions, thus, better than conventional methods.
* The language of CKA algebra helps the application developer in understanding which are the more computational efficient FFT variants thus reducing the computational effort and improve their implementation time.

===== Disadvantages =====
* FFT cannot separate sinusoids close in frequency. If the periodicity of the data does not match FFT, edge effects are seen.

==== Capon method ====
The Capon spectral method, also called the minimum-variance method, is a multidimensional array-processing technique. It is a nonparametric covariance-based method, which uses an adaptive matched-filterbank approach and follows two main steps:
# Passing the data through a 2D bandpass filter with varying center frequencies (formula_1).
# Estimating the power at (formula_1) for all formula_3 of interest from the filtered data.

The adaptive Capon bandpass filter is designed to minimize the power of the filter output, as well as pass the frequencies (formula_1) without any attenuation, i.e., to satisfy, for each (formula_1),

: formula_6 subject to formula_7

where &quot;R&quot; is the covariance matrix, formula_8 is the complex conjugate transpose of the impulse response of the FIR filter, formula_9 is the 2D Fourier vector, defined as formula_10, formula_11 denotes Kronecker product.

Therefore, it passes a 2D sinusoid at a given frequency without distortion while minimizing the variance of the noise of the resulting image. The purpose is to compute the spectral estimate efficiently.

&quot;Spectral estimate&quot; is given as

: formula_12

where &quot;R&quot; is the covariance matrix, and formula_13 is the 2D complex-conjugate transpose of the Fourier vector. The computation of this equation over all frequencies is time-consuming. It is seen that the forward–backward Capon estimator yields better estimation than the forward-only classical capon approach. The main reason behind this is that while the forward–backward Capon uses both the forward and backward data vectors to obtain the estimate of the covariance matrix, the forward-only Capon uses only the forward data vectors to estimate the covariance matrix.

===== Advantages =====
* Capon can yield more accurate spectral estimates with much lower sidelobes and narrower spectral peaks than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method.
* Capon method can provide much better resolution.

===== Disadvantages =====
* Implementation requires computation of two intensive tasks: inversion of the covariance matrix &quot;R&quot; and multiplication by the formula_9 matrix, which has to be done for each point formula_15.

==== APES method ====
The APES (amplitude and phase estimation) method is also a matched-filter-bank method, which assumes that the phase history data is a sum of 2D sinusoids in noise.

APES spectral estimator has 2-step filtering interpretation:
# Passing data through a bank of FIR bandpass filters with varying center frequency formula_16.
# Obtaining the spectrum estimate for formula_17 from the filtered data.

Empirically, the APES method results in wider spectral peaks than the Capon method, but more accurate spectral estimates for amplitude in SAR. In the Capon method, although the spectral peaks are narrower than the APES, the sidelobes are higher than that for the APES. As a result, the estimate for the amplitude is expected to be less accurate for the Capon method than for the APES method. The APES method requires about 1.5 times more computation than the Capon method.

===== Advantages =====
* Filtering reduces the number of available samples, but when it is designed tactically, the increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the filtered data will compensate this reduction, and the amplitude of a sinusoidal component with frequency formula_16 can be estimated more accurately from the filtered data than from the original signal.

===== Disadvantages =====
* The autocovariance matrix is much larger in 2D than in 1D, therefore it is limited by memory available.

=== SAMV method ===

SAMV method is a parameter-free sparse signal reconstruction based algorithm. It achieves super-resolution and is robust to highly correlated signals. The name emphasizes its basis on the asymptotically minimum variance (AMV) criterion. It is a powerful tool for the recovery of both the amplitude and frequency characteristics of multiple highly correlated sources in challenging environment (e.g., limited number of snapshots, low signal-to-noise ratio. Applications include synthetic-aperture radar imaging and various source localization.

==== Advantages ====

SAMV method is capable of achieving resolution higher than some established parametric methods, e.g., MUSIC, especially with highly correlated signals.

==== Disadvantages ====

Computational complexity of the SAMV method is higher due to its iterative procedure.

=== Parametric subspace decomposition methods ===

==== Eigenvector method ====
This subspace decomposition method separates the eigenvectors of the autocovariance matrix into those corresponding to signals and to clutter. The amplitude of the image at a point (formula_19 ) is given by:

: formula_20

where formula_21 is the amplitude of the image at a point formula_22 , formula_23 is the coherency matrix and formula_24 is the Hermitian of the coherency matrix, formula_25 is the inverse of the eigenvalues of the clutter subspace, formula_26 are vectors defined as

: formula_27

where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product of the two vectors.

===== Advantages =====
* Shows features of image more accurately.

===== Disadvantages =====
* High computational complexity.

==== MUSIC method ====
MUSIC detects frequencies in a signal by performing an eigen decomposition on the covariance matrix of a data vector of the samples obtained from the samples of the received signal. When all of the eigenvectors are included in the clutter subspace (model order = 0) the EV method becomes identical to the Capon method. Thus the determination of model order is critical to operation of the EV method. The eigenvalue of the R matrix decides whether its corresponding eigenvector corresponds to the clutter or to the signal subspace.

The MUSIC method is considered to be a poor performer in SAR applications. This method uses a constant instead of the clutter subspace.

In this method, the denominator is equated to zero when a sinusoidal signal corresponding to a point in the SAR image is in alignment to one of the signal subspace eigenvectors which is the peak in image estimate. Thus this method does not accurately represent the scattering intensity at each point, but show the particular points of the image.

===== Advantages =====
* MUSIC whitens or equalizes, the clutter eigenvalues.

===== Disadvantages =====
* Resolution loss due to the averaging operation.

=== Backprojection algorithm ===
Backprojection Algorithm has two methods: &quot;Time-domain Backprojection&quot; and &quot;Frequency-domain Backprojection&quot;. The time-domain Backprojection has more advantages over frequency-domain and thus, is more preferred. The time-domain Backprojection forms images or spectrums by matching the data acquired from the radar and as per what it expects to receive. It can be considered as an ideal matched-filter for synthetic-aperture radar. There is no need of having a different motion compensation step due to its quality of handling non-ideal motion/sampling. It can also be used for various imaging geometries.

==== Advantages ====
* &quot;It is invariant to the imaging mode&quot;: which means, that it uses the same algorithm irrespective of the imaging mode present, whereas, frequency domain methods require changes depending on the mode and geometry.
* Ambiguous azimuth aliasing usually occurs when the Nyquist spatial sampling requirements are exceeded by frequencies. Unambiguous aliasing occurs in squinted geometries where the signal bandwidth does not exceed the sampling limits, but has undergone &quot;spectral wrapping.&quot; Backprojection Algorithm does not get affected by any such kind of aliasing effects.
* &quot;It matches the space/time filter:&quot; uses the information about the imaging geometry, to produce a pixel-by-pixel varying matched filter to approximate the expected return signal. This usually yields antenna gain compensation.
* With reference to the previous advantage, the back projection algorithm compensates for the motion. This becomes an advantage at areas having low altitudes.

==== Disadvantages ====
* The computational expense is more for Backprojection algorithm as compared to other frequency domain methods.
* It requires very precise knowledge of imaging geometry.

==== Application: geosynchronous orbit synthetic-aperture radar (GEO-SAR) ====
In GEO-SAR, to focus specially on the relative moving track, the backprojection algorithm works very well. It uses the concept of Azimuth Processing in the time domain. For the satellite-ground geometry, GEO-SAR plays a significant role.

The procedure of this concept is elaborated as follows. 
# The raw data acquired is segmented or drawn into sub-apertures for simplification of speedy conduction of procedure.
# The range of the data is then compressed, using the concept of &quot;Matched Filtering&quot; for every segment/sub-aperture created. It is given by-formula_28 where &quot;τ&quot; is the range time, &quot;t&quot; is the azimuthal time, &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.
# Accuracy in the &quot;Range Migration Curve&quot; is achieved by range interpolation.
# The pixel locations of the ground in the image is dependent on the satellite–ground geometry model. Grid-division is now done as per the azimuth time.
# Calculations for the &quot;slant range&quot; (range between the antenna&#x27;s phase center and the point on the ground) are done for every azimuth time using coordinate transformations.
# Azimuth Compression is done after the previous step.
# Step 5 and 6 are repeated for every pixel, to cover every pixel, and conduct the procedure on every sub-aperture.
# Lastly, all the sub-apertures of the image created throughout, are superimposed onto each other and the ultimate HD image is generated.

=== Comparison between the algorithms ===
Capon and APES can yield more accurate spectral estimates with much lower sidelobes and more narrow spectral peaks than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method, which is also a special case of the FIR filtering approaches. It is seen that although the APES algorithm gives slightly wider spectral peaks than the Capon method, the former yields more accurate overall spectral estimates than the latter and the FFT method.

FFT method is fast and simple but have larger sidelobes. Capon has high resolution but high computational complexity. EV also has high resolution and high computational complexity. APES has higher resolution, faster than capon and EV but high computational complexity.

MUSIC method is not generally suitable for SAR imaging, as whitening the clutter eigenvalues destroys the spatial inhomogeneities associated with terrain clutter or other diffuse scattering in SAR imagery. But it offers higher frequency resolution in the resulting power spectral density (PSD) than the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based methods.

The backprojection algorithm is computationally expensive. It is specifically attractive for sensors that are wideband, wide-angle, and/or have long coherent apertures with substantial off-track motion.

==Multistatic operation==

SAR requires that echo captures be taken at multiple antenna positions. The more captures taken (at different antenna locations) the more reliable the target characterization.

Multiple captures can be obtained by moving a single antenna to different locations, by placing multiple stationary antennas at different locations, or combinations thereof.

The advantage of a single moving antenna is that it can be easily placed in any number of positions to provide any number of monostatic waveforms. For example, an antenna mounted on an airplane takes many captures per second as the plane travels.

The principal advantages of multiple static antennas are that a moving target can be characterized (assuming the capture electronics are fast enough), that no vehicle or motion machinery is necessary, and that antenna positions need not be derived from other, sometimes unreliable, information. (One problem with SAR aboard an airplane is knowing precise antenna positions as the plane travels).

For multiple static antennas, all combinations of monostatic and multistatic radar waveform captures are possible. Note, however, that it is not advantageous to capture a waveform for each of both transmission directions for a given pair of antennas, because those waveforms will be identical. When multiple static antennas are used, the total number of unique echo waveforms that can be captured is

:formula_29

where &quot;N&quot; is the number of unique antenna positions.

== Scanning modes ==

=== Stripmap mode airborne SAR ===

The antenna stays in a fixed position. It may be orthogonal to the flight path, or it may be squinted slightly forward or backward.

When the antenna aperture travels along the flight path, a signal is transmitted at a rate equal to the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The lower boundary of the PRF is determined by the Doppler bandwidth of the radar. The backscatter of each of these signals is commutatively added on a pixel-by-pixel basis to attain the fine azimuth resolution desired in radar imagery.

=== Spotlight mode SAR ===

The spotlight synthetic aperture is given by

: formula_30

where formula_31 is the angle formed between the beginning and end of the imaging, as shown in the diagram of spotlight imaging and formula_32 is the range distance.

The spotlight mode gives better resolution albeit for a smaller ground patch. In this mode, the illuminating radar beam is steered continually as the aircraft moves, so that it illuminates the same patch over a longer period of time. This mode is not a traditional continuous-strip imaging mode; however, it has high azimuth resolution. A technical explanation of spotlight SAR from first principles is offered in.

=== Scan mode SAR ===

While operating as a scan mode SAR, the antenna beam sweeps periodically and thus cover much larger area than the spotlight and stripmap modes. However, the azimuth resolution become much lower than the stripmap mode due to the decreased azimuth bandwidth. Clearly there is a balance achieved between the azimuth resolution and the scan area of SAR. Here, the synthetic aperture is shared between the sub swaths, and it is not in direct contact within one subswath. Mosaic operation is required in azimuth and range directions to join the azimuth bursts and the range sub-swaths.

* ScanSAR makes the swath beam huge.
* The azimuth signal has many bursts.
* The azimuth resolution is limited due to the burst duration.
* Each target contains varied frequencies which completely depends on where the azimuth is present.

==Special techniques==

===Polarimetry===
Radar waves have a polarization. Different materials reflect radar waves with different intensities, but anisotropic materials such as grass often reflect different polarizations with different intensities. Some materials will also convert one polarization into another. By emitting a mixture of polarizations and using receiving antennas with a specific polarization, several images can be collected from the same series of pulses. Frequently three such RX-TX polarizations (HH-pol, VV-pol, VH-pol) are used as the three color channels in a synthesized image. This is what has been done in the picture at right. Interpretation of the resulting colors requires significant testing of known materials.

New developments in polarimetry include using the changes in the random polarization returns of some surfaces (such as grass or sand) and between two images of the same location at different times to determine where changes not visible to optical systems occurred. Examples include subterranean tunneling or paths of vehicles driving through the area being imaged. Enhanced SAR sea oil slick observation has been developed by appropriate physical modelling and use of fully polarimetric and dual-polarimetric measurements.

==== SAR polarimetry ====

SAR polarimetry is a technique used for deriving qualitative and quantitative physical information for land, snow and ice, ocean and urban applications based on the measurement and exploration of the polarimetric properties of man-made and natural scatterers. &quot;Terrain&quot; and &quot;land use&quot; classification is one of the most important applications of polarimetric synthetic-aperture radar (PolSAR).

SAR polarimetry uses a scattering matrix (S) to identify the scattering behavior of objects after an interaction with electromagnetic wave. The matrix is represented by a combination of horizontal and vertical polarization states of transmitted and received signals.

formula_33

where, HH is for horizontal transmit and horizontal receive, VV is for vertical transmit and vertical receive, HV is for horizontal transmit and vertical receive, and VH – for vertical transmit and horizontal receive.

The first two of these polarization combinations are referred to as like-polarized (or co-polarized), because the transmit and receive polarizations are the same. The last two combinations are referred to as cross-polarized because the transmit and receive polarizations are orthogonal to one another.

==== Three-component scattering power model ====
The three-component scattering power model by Freeman and Durden is successfully used for the decomposition of a PolSAR image, applying the reflection symmetry condition using covariance matrix. The method is based on simple physical scattering mechanisms (surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, and volume scattering). The advantage of this scattering model is that it is simple and easy to implement for image processing. There are 2 major approaches for a 3formula_343 polarimetric matrix decomposition. One is the lexicographic covariance matrix approach based on physically measurable parameters, and the other is the Pauli decomposition which is a coherent decomposition matrix. It represents all the polarimetric information in a single SAR image. The polarimetric information of [S] could be represented by the combination of the intensities formula_35 in a single RGB image where all the previous intensities will be coded as a color channel.

==== Four-component scattering power model ====
For PolSAR image analysis, there can be cases where reflection symmetry condition does not hold. In those cases a &quot;four-component scattering model&quot; can be used to decompose polarimetric synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images. This approach deals with the non-reflection symmetric scattering case. It includes and extends the three-component decomposition method introduced by Freeman and Durden to a fourth component by adding the helix scattering power. This helix power term generally appears in complex urban area but disappears for a natural distributed scatterer.

There is also an improved method using the four-component decomposition algorithm, which was introduced for the general polSAR data image analyses. The SAR data is first filtered which is known as speckle reduction, then each pixel is decomposed by four-component model to determine the surface scattering power (formula_36), double-bounce scattering power (formula_37), volume scattering power (formula_38), and helix scattering power (formula_39). The pixels are then divided into 5 classes (surface, double-bounce, volume, helix, and mixed pixels) classified with respect to maximum powers. A mixed category is added for the pixels having two or three equal dominant scattering powers after computation. The process continues as the pixels in all these categories are divided in 20 small clutter approximately of same number of pixels and merged as desirable, this is called cluster merging. They are iteratively classified and then automatically color is delivered to each class. The summarization of this algorithm leads to an understanding that, brown colors denotes the surface scattering classes, red colors for double-bounce scattering classes, green colors for volume scattering classes, and blue colors for helix scattering classes.

Although this method is aimed for non-reflection case, it automatically includes the reflection symmetry condition, therefore in can be used as a general case. It also preserves the scattering characteristics by taking the mixed scattering category into account therefore proving to be a better algorithm.

===Interferometry===
Rather than discarding the phase data, information can be extracted from it. If two observations of the same terrain from very similar positions are available, aperture synthesis can be performed to provide the resolution performance which would be given by a radar system with dimensions equal to the separation of the two measurements. This technique is called interferometric SAR or InSAR.

If the two samples are obtained simultaneously (perhaps by placing two antennas on the same aircraft, some distance apart), then any phase difference will contain information about the angle from which the radar echo returned. Combining this with the distance information, one can determine the position in three dimensions of the image pixel. In other words, one can extract terrain altitude as well as radar reflectivity, producing a digital elevation model (DEM) with a single airplane pass. One aircraft application at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing produced digital elevation maps with a resolution of 5 m and altitude errors also about 5 m. Interferometry was used to map many regions of the Earth&#x27;s surface with unprecedented accuracy using data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.

If the two samples are separated in time, perhaps from two flights over the same terrain, then there are two possible sources of phase shift. The first is terrain altitude, as discussed above. The second is terrain motion: if the terrain has shifted between observations, it will return a different phase. The amount of shift required to cause a significant phase difference is on the order of the wavelength used. This means that if the terrain shifts by centimeters, it can be seen in the resulting image (a digital elevation map must be available to separate the two kinds of phase difference; a third pass may be necessary to produce one).

This second method offers a powerful tool in geology and geography. Glacier flow can be mapped with two passes. Maps showing the land deformation after a minor earthquake or after a volcanic eruption (showing the shrinkage of the whole volcano by several centimeters) have been published.

====Differential interferometry====
Differential interferometry (D-InSAR) requires taking at least two images with addition of a DEM. The DEM can be either produced by GPS measurements or could be generated by interferometry as long as the time between acquisition of the image pairs is short, which guarantees minimal distortion of the image of the target surface. In principle, 3 images of the ground area with similar image acquisition geometry is often adequate for D-InSar. The principle for detecting ground movement is quite simple. One interferogram is created from the first two images; this is also called the reference interferogram or topographical interferogram. A second interferogram is created that captures topography + distortion. Subtracting the latter from the reference interferogram can reveal differential fringes, indicating movement. The described 3 image D-InSAR generation technique is called 3-pass or double-difference method.

Differential fringes which remain as fringes in the differential interferogram are a result of SAR range changes of any displaced point on the ground from one interferogram to the next. In the differential interferogram, each fringe is directly proportional to the SAR wavelength, which is about 5.6 cm for ERS and RADARSAT single phase cycle. Surface displacement away from the satellite look direction causes an increase in path (translating to phase) difference. Since the signal travels from the SAR antenna to the target and back again, the measured displacement is twice the unit of wavelength. This means in differential interferometry one fringe cycle − to + or one wavelength corresponds to a displacement relative to SAR antenna of only half wavelength (2.8 cm). There are various publications on measuring subsidence movement, slope stability analysis, landslide, glacier movement, etc. tooling D-InSAR. Further advancement to this technique whereby differential interferometry from satellite SAR ascending pass and descending pass can be used to estimate 3-D ground movement. Research in this area has shown accurate measurements of 3-D ground movement with accuracies comparable to GPS based measurements can be achieved.

==== Tomo-SAR ====
SAR Tomography is a subfield of a concept named as multi-baseline interferometry. It has been developed to give a 3D exposure to the imaging, which uses the beam formation concept. It can be used when the use demands a focused phase concern between the magnitude and the phase components of the SAR data, during information retrieval. One of the major advantages of Tomo-SAR is that it can separate out the parameters which get scattered, irrespective of how different their motions are.
On using Tomo-SAR with differential interferometry, a new combination named &quot;differential tomography&quot; (Diff-Tomo) is developed.

Tomo-SAR has an application based on radar imaging, which is the depiction of Ice Volume and Forest Temporal Coherence (Temporal coherence describes the correlation between waves observed at different moments in time).

===Ultra-wideband SAR===

Conventional radar systems emit bursts of radio energy with a fairly narrow range of frequencies. A narrow-band channel, by definition, does not allow rapid changes in modulation. Since it is the change in a received signal that reveals the time of arrival of the signal (obviously an unchanging signal would reveal nothing about &quot;when&quot; it reflected from the target), a signal with only a slow change in modulation cannot reveal the distance to the target as well as a signal with a quick change in modulation.

Ultra-wideband (UWB) refers to any radio transmission that uses a very large bandwidth – which is the same as saying it uses very rapid changes in modulation. Although there is no set bandwidth value that qualifies a signal as &quot;UWB&quot;, systems using bandwidths greater than a sizable portion of the center frequency (typically about ten percent, or so) are most often called &quot;UWB&quot; systems. A typical UWB system might use a bandwidth of one-third to one-half of its center frequency. For example, some systems use a bandwidth of about 1 GHz centered around 3 GHz.

The two most common methods to increase signal bandwidth used in UWB radar, including SAR, are very short pulses and high-bandwidth chirping. A general description of chirping appears elsewhere in this article. The bandwidth of a chirped system can be as narrow or as wide as the designers desire. Pulse-based UWB systems, being the more common method associated with the term &quot;UWB radar&quot;, are described here.

A pulse-based radar system transmits very short pulses of electromagnetic energy, typically only a few waves or less. A very short pulse is, of course, a very rapidly changing signal, and thus occupies a very wide bandwidth. This allows far more accurate measurement of distance, and thus resolution.

The main disadvantage of pulse-based UWB SAR is that the transmitting and receiving front-end electronics are difficult to design for high-power applications. Specifically, the transmit duty cycle is so exceptionally low and pulse time so exceptionally short, that the electronics must be capable of extremely high instantaneous power to rival the average power of conventional radars. (Although it is true that UWB provides a notable gain in channel capacity over a narrow band signal because of the relationship of bandwidth in the Shannon–Hartley theorem and because the low receive duty cycle receives less noise, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, there is still a notable disparity in link budget because conventional radar might be several orders of magnitude more powerful than a typical pulse-based radar.) So pulse-based UWB SAR is typically used in applications requiring average power levels in the microwatt or milliwatt range, and thus is used for scanning smaller, nearer target areas (several tens of meters), or in cases where lengthy integration (over a span of minutes) of the received signal is possible. However, that this limitation is solved in chirped UWB radar systems.

The principal advantages of UWB radar are better resolution (a few millimeters using commercial off-the-shelf electronics) and more spectral information of target reflectivity.

===Doppler-beam sharpening===
Doppler Beam Sharpening commonly refers to the method of processing unfocused real-beam phase history to achieve better resolution than could be achieved by processing the real beam without it. Because the real aperture of the radar antenna is so small (compared to the wavelength in use), the radar energy spreads over a wide area (usually many degrees wide in a direction orthogonal (at right angles) to the direction of the platform (aircraft)). Doppler-beam sharpening takes advantage of the motion of the platform in that targets ahead of the platform return a Doppler upshifted signal (slightly higher in frequency) and targets behind the platform return a Doppler downshifted signal (slightly lower in frequency).

The amount of shift varies with the angle forward or backward from the ortho-normal direction. By knowing the speed of the platform, target signal return is placed in a specific angle &quot;bin&quot; that changes over time. Signals are integrated over time and thus the radar &quot;beam&quot; is synthetically reduced to a much smaller aperture – or more accurately (and based on the ability to distinguish smaller Doppler shifts) the system can have hundreds of very &quot;tight&quot; beams concurrently. This technique dramatically improves angular resolution; however, it is far more difficult to take advantage of this technique for range resolution. (See pulse-doppler radar).

===Chirped (pulse-compressed) radars===

A common technique for many radar systems (usually also found in SAR systems) is to &quot;chirp&quot; the signal. In a &quot;chirped&quot; radar, the pulse is allowed to be much longer. A longer pulse allows more energy to be emitted, and hence received, but usually hinders range resolution. But in a chirped radar, this longer pulse also has a frequency shift during the pulse (hence the chirp or frequency shift). When the &quot;chirped&quot; signal is returned, it must be correlated with the sent pulse. Classically, in analog systems, it is passed to a dispersive delay line (often a surface acoustic wave device) that has the property of varying velocity of propagation based on frequency. This technique &quot;compresses&quot; the pulse in time – thus having the effect of a much shorter pulse (improved range resolution) while having the benefit of longer pulse length (much more signal returned). Newer systems use digital pulse correlation to find the pulse return in the signal.

==Typical operation==
=== Data collection ===
In a typical SAR application, a single radar antenna is attached to an aircraft or spacecraft such that a substantial component of the antenna&#x27;s radiated beam has a wave-propagation direction perpendicular to the flight-path direction. The beam is allowed to be broad in the vertical direction so it will illuminate the terrain from nearly beneath the aircraft out toward the horizon.

==== Image resolution and bandwidth ====
Resolution in the range dimension of the image is accomplished by creating pulses which define very short time intervals, either by emitting short pulses consisting of a carrier frequency and the necessary sidebands, all within a certain bandwidth, or by using longer &quot;chirp pulses&quot; in which frequency varies (often linearly) with time within that bandwidth. The differing times at which echoes return allow points at different distances to be distinguished.

Image resolution of SAR in its range coordinate (expressed in image pixels per distance unit) is mainly proportional to the radio bandwidth of whatever type of pulse is used. In the cross-range coordinate, the similar resolution is mainly proportional to the bandwidth of the Doppler shift of the signal returns within the beamwidth. Since Doppler frequency depends on the angle of the scattering point&#x27;s direction from the broadside direction, the Doppler bandwidth available within the beamwidth is the same at all ranges. Hence the theoretical spatial resolution limits in both image dimensions remain constant with variation of range. However, in practice, both the errors that accumulate with data-collection time and the particular techniques used in post-processing further limit cross-range resolution at long ranges.

==== Image resolution and beamwidth ====
The total signal is that from a beamwidth-sized patch of the ground. To produce a beam that is narrow in the cross-range direction, diffraction effects require that the antenna be wide in that dimension. Therefore, the distinguishing, from each other, of co-range points simply by strengths of returns that persist for as long as they are within the beam width is difficult with aircraft-carryable antennas, because their beams can have linear widths only about two orders of magnitude (hundreds of times) smaller than the range. (Spacecraft-carryable ones can do 10 or more times better.) However, if both the amplitude and the phase of returns are recorded, then the portion of that multi-target return that was scattered radially from any smaller scene element can be extracted by phase-vector correlation of the total return with the form of the return expected from each such element.

The process can be thought of as combining the series of spatially distributed observations as if all had been made simultaneously with an antenna as long as the beamwidth and focused on that particular point. The &quot;synthetic aperture&quot; simulated at maximum system range by this process not only is longer than the real antenna, but, in practical applications, it is much longer than the radar aircraft, and tremendously longer than the radar spacecraft.

Although some references to SARs have characterized them as &quot;radar telescopes&quot;, their actual optical analogy is the microscope, the detail in their images being smaller than the length of the synthetic aperture. In radar-engineering terms, while the target area is in the &quot;far field&quot; of the illuminating antenna, it is in the &quot;near field&quot; of the simulated one. Careful design and operation can accomplish resolution of items smaller than a millionth of the range, for example, 30 cm at 300 km, or about one foot at nearly .

==== Pulse transmission and reception ====
The conversion of return delay time to geometric range can be very accurate because of the natural constancy of the speed and direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves. However, for an aircraft flying through the never-uniform and never-quiescent atmosphere, the relating of pulse transmission and reception times to successive geometric positions of the antenna must be accompanied by constant adjusting of the return phases to account for sensed irregularities in the flight path. SAR&#x27;s in spacecraft avoid that atmosphere problem, but still must make corrections for known antenna movements due to rotations of the spacecraft, even those that are reactions to movements of onboard machinery. Locating a SAR in a crewed space vehicle may require that the humans carefully remain motionless relative to the vehicle during data collection periods.

Returns from scatterers within the range extent of any image are spread over a matching time interval. The inter-pulse period must be long enough to allow farthest-range returns from any pulse to finish arriving before the nearest-range ones from the next pulse begin to appear, so that those do not overlap each other in time. On the other hand, the interpulse rate must be fast enough to provide sufficient samples for the desired across-range (or across-beam) resolution. When the radar is to be carried by a high-speed vehicle and is to image a large area at fine resolution, those conditions may clash, leading to what has been called SAR&#x27;s ambiguity problem. The same considerations apply to &quot;conventional&quot; radars also, but this problem occurs significantly only when resolution is so fine as to be available only through SAR processes. Since the basis of the problem is the information-carrying capacity of the single signal-input channel provided by one antenna, the only solution is to use additional channels fed by additional antennas. The system then becomes a hybrid of a SAR and a phased array, sometimes being called a Vernier array.

=== Data processing ===
Combining the series of observations requires significant computational resources, usually using Fourier transform techniques. The high digital computing speed now available allows such processing to be done in near-real time on board a SAR aircraft. (There is necessarily a minimum time delay until all parts of the signal have been received.) The result is a map of radar reflectivity, including both amplitude and phase.

==== Amplitude data ====
The amplitude information, when shown in a map-like display, gives information about ground cover in much the same way that a black-and-white photo does. Variations in processing may also be done in either vehicle-borne stations or ground stations for various purposes, so as to accentuate certain image features for detailed target-area analysis.

==== Phase data ====
Although the phase information in an image is generally not made available to a human observer of an image display device, it can be preserved numerically, and sometimes allows certain additional features of targets to be recognized.

==== Coherence speckle ====
Unfortunately, the phase differences between adjacent image picture elements (&quot;pixels&quot;) also produce random interference effects called &quot;coherence speckle&quot;, which is a sort of graininess with dimensions on the order of the resolution, causing the concept of resolution to take on a subtly different meaning. This effect is the same as is apparent both visually and photographically in laser-illuminated optical scenes. The scale of that random speckle structure is governed by the size of the synthetic aperture in wavelengths, and cannot be finer than the system&#x27;s resolution. Speckle structure can be subdued at the expense of resolution.

==== Optical holography ====
Before rapid digital computers were available, the data processing was done using an optical holography technique. The analog radar data were recorded as a holographic interference pattern on photographic film at a scale permitting the film to preserve the signal bandwidths (for example, 1:1,000,000 for a radar using a 0.6-meter wavelength). Then light using, for example, 0.6-micrometer waves (as from a helium–neon laser) passing through the hologram could project a terrain image at a scale recordable on another film at reasonable processor focal distances of around a meter. This worked because both SAR and phased arrays are fundamentally similar to optical holography, but using microwaves instead of light waves. The &quot;optical data-processors&quot; developed for this radar purpose were the first effective analog optical computer systems, and were, in fact, devised before the holographic technique was fully adapted to optical imaging. Because of the different sources of range and across-range signal structures in the radar signals, optical data-processors for SAR included not only both spherical and cylindrical lenses, but sometimes conical ones.

== Image appearance ==
The following considerations apply also to real-aperture terrain-imaging radars, but are more consequential when resolution in range is matched to a cross-beam resolution that is available only from a SAR.
=== Range, cross-range, and angles ===

The two dimensions of a radar image are range and cross-range. Radar images of limited patches of terrain can resemble oblique photographs, but not ones taken from the location of the radar. This is because the range coordinate in a radar image is perpendicular to the vertical-angle coordinate of an oblique photo. The apparent entrance-pupil position (or camera center) for viewing such an image is therefore not as if at the radar, but as if at a point from which the viewer&#x27;s line of sight is perpendicular to the slant-range direction connecting radar and target, with slant-range increasing from top to bottom of the image.

Because slant ranges to level terrain vary in vertical angle, each elevation of such terrain appears as a curved surface, specifically a hyperbolic cosine one. Verticals at various ranges are perpendiculars to those curves. The viewer&#x27;s apparent looking directions are parallel to the curve&#x27;s &quot;hypcos&quot; axis. Items directly beneath the radar appear as if optically viewed horizontally (i.e., from the side) and those at far ranges as if optically viewed from directly above. These curvatures are not evident unless large extents of near-range terrain, including steep slant ranges, are being viewed.

===Visibility===
When viewed as specified above, fine-resolution radar images of small areas can appear most nearly like familiar optical ones, for two reasons. The first reason is easily understood by imagining a flagpole in the scene. The slant-range to its upper end is less than that to its base. Therefore, the pole can appear correctly top-end up only when viewed in the above orientation. Secondly, the radar illumination then being downward, shadows are seen in their most-familiar &quot;overhead-lighting&quot; direction.

The image of the pole&#x27;s top will overlay that of some terrain point which is on the same slant range arc but at a shorter horizontal range (&quot;ground-range&quot;). Images of scene surfaces which faced both the illumination and the apparent eyepoint will have geometries that resemble those of an optical scene viewed from that eyepoint. However, slopes facing the radar will be foreshortened and ones facing away from it will be lengthened from their horizontal (map) dimensions. The former will therefore be brightened and the latter dimmed.

Returns from slopes steeper than perpendicular to slant range will be overlaid on those of lower-elevation terrain at a nearer ground-range, both being visible but intermingled. This is especially the case for vertical surfaces like the walls of buildings. Another viewing inconvenience that arises when a surface is steeper than perpendicular to the slant range is that it is then illuminated on one face but &quot;viewed&quot; from the reverse face. Then one &quot;sees&quot;, for example, the radar-facing wall of a building as if from the inside, while the building&#x27;s interior and the rear wall (that nearest to, hence expected to be optically visible to, the viewer) have vanished, since they lack illumination, being in the shadow of the front wall and the roof. Some return from the roof may overlay that from the front wall, and both of those may overlay return from terrain in front of the building. The visible building shadow will include those of all illuminated items. Long shadows may exhibit blurred edges due to the illuminating antenna&#x27;s movement during the &quot;time exposure&quot; needed to create the image.

=== Mirroring artefacts and shadows ===
Surfaces that we usually consider rough will, if that roughness consists of relief less than the radar wavelength, behave as smooth mirrors, showing, beyond such a surface, additional images of items in front of it. Those mirror images will appear within the shadow of the mirroring surface, sometimes filling the entire shadow, thus preventing recognition of the shadow.

The direction of overlay of any scene point is not directly toward the radar, but toward that point of the SAR&#x27;s current path direction that is nearest to the target point. If the SAR is &quot;squinting&quot; forward or aft away from the exactly broadside direction, then the illumination direction, and hence the shadow direction, will not be opposite to the overlay direction, but slanted to right or left from it. An image will appear with the correct projection geometry when viewed so that the overlay direction is vertical, the SAR&#x27;s flight-path is above the image, and range increases somewhat downward.

=== Objects in motion ===
Objects in motion within a SAR scene alter the Doppler frequencies of the returns. Such objects therefore appear in the image at locations offset in the across-range direction by amounts proportional to the range-direction component of their velocity. Road vehicles may be depicted off the roadway and therefore not recognized as road traffic items. Trains appearing away from their tracks are more easily properly recognized by their length parallel to known trackage as well as by the absence of an equal length of railbed signature and of some adjacent terrain, both having been shadowed by the train. While images of moving vessels can be offset from the line of the earlier parts of their wakes, the more recent parts of the wake, which still partake of some of the vessel&#x27;s motion, appear as curves connecting the vessel image to the relatively quiescent far-aft wake. In such identifiable cases, speed and direction of the moving items can be determined from the amounts of their offsets. The along-track component of a target&#x27;s motion causes some defocus. Random motions such as that of wind-driven tree foliage, vehicles driven over rough terrain, or humans or other animals walking or running generally render those items not focusable, resulting in blurring or even effective invisibility.

These considerations, along with the speckle structure due to coherence, take some getting used to in order to correctly interpret SAR images. To assist in that, large collections of significant target signatures have been accumulated by performing many test flights over known terrains and cultural objects.

== History ==
==Relationship to phased arrays==

A technique closely related to SAR uses an array (referred to as a &quot;phased array&quot;) of real antenna elements spatially distributed over either one or two dimensions perpendicular to the radar-range dimension. These physical arrays are truly synthetic ones, indeed being created by synthesis of a collection of subsidiary physical antennas. Their operation need not involve motion relative to targets. All elements of these arrays receive simultaneously in real time, and the signals passing through them can be individually subjected to controlled shifts of the phases of those signals. One result can be to respond most strongly to radiation received from a specific small scene area, focusing on that area to determine its contribution to the total signal received. The coherently detected set of signals received over the entire array aperture can be replicated in several data-processing channels and processed differently in each. The set of responses thus traced to different small scene areas can be displayed together as an image of the scene.

In comparison, a SAR&#x27;s (commonly) single physical antenna element gathers signals at different positions at different times. When the radar is carried by an aircraft or an orbiting vehicle, those positions are functions of a single variable, distance along the vehicle&#x27;s path, which is a single mathematical dimension (not necessarily the same as a linear geometric dimension). The signals are stored, thus becoming functions, no longer of time, but of recording locations along that dimension. When the stored signals are read out later and combined with specific phase shifts, the result is the same as if the recorded data had been gathered by an equally long and shaped phased array. What is thus synthesized is a set of signals equivalent to what could have been received simultaneously by such an actual large-aperture (in one dimension) phased array. The SAR simulates (rather than synthesizes) that long one-dimensional phased array. Although the term in the title of this article has thus been incorrectly derived, it is now firmly established by half a century of usage.

While operation of a phased array is readily understood as a completely geometric technique, the fact that a synthetic aperture system gathers its data as it (or its target) moves at some speed means that phases which varied with the distance traveled originally varied with time, hence constituted temporal frequencies. Temporal frequencies being the variables commonly used by radar engineers, their analyses of SAR systems are usually (and very productively) couched in such terms. In particular, the variation of phase during flight over the length of the synthetic aperture is seen as a sequence of Doppler shifts of the received frequency from that of the transmitted frequency. Once the received data have been recorded and thus have become timeless, the SAR data-processing situation is also understandable as a special type of phased array, treatable as a completely geometric process.

The core of both the SAR and the phased array techniques is that the distances that radar waves travel to and back from each scene element consist of some integer number of wavelengths plus some fraction of a &quot;final&quot; wavelength. Those fractions cause differences between the phases of the re-radiation received at various SAR or array positions. Coherent detection is needed to capture the signal phase information in addition to the signal amplitude information. That type of detection requires finding the differences between the phases of the received signals and the simultaneous phase of a well-preserved sample of the transmitted illumination.

<doc id="645560" wikidata="Q1226698" url="?curid=645560" title="Dinosaur National Monument">
<text>Dinosaur National Monument is an American national monument located on the southeast flank of the Uinta Mountains on the border between Colorado and Utah at the confluence of the Green and Yampa rivers. Although most of the monument area is in Moffat County, Colorado, the Dinosaur Quarry is located in Utah, north of the town of Jensen, Utah. The nearest Colorado town is Dinosaur while the nearest city is Vernal, Utah.

Originally preserved in 1915 to protect its famous Dinosaur Quarry, the monument was greatly expanded in 1938 to include its wealth of natural history. The park&#x27;s wild landscapes, topography, geology, paleontology, and history make it a unique resource for both science and recreation. The park contains over 800 paleontological sites and has fossils of dinosaurs including &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, &quot;Abydosaurus&quot;, and various sauropods. The &quot;Abydosaurus&quot; consists of a nearly complete skull, the lower jaw, and first four neck vertebrae. The specimen was found at the base of the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation and is the holotype for the description.

Paleontologist Earl Douglass of the Carnegie Museum discovered eight vertebra of an Apatosaurus on August 17, 1909, which became the first dinosaur skeleton discovered and excavated at the new Carnegie Quarry. The area around the quarry was declared a national monument on October 4, 1915. The International Dark-Sky Association designated Dinosaur National Monument an International Dark Sky Park in April 2019.

==Geology==

The rock layer enclosing the fossils is a sandstone and conglomerate bed of alluvial or river bed origin known as the Morrison Formation from the Jurassic Period some 150 million years old. The dinosaurs and other ancient animals were carried by the river system which eventually entombed their remains in Utah.

The pile of sediments were later buried and lithified into solid rock. The layers of rock were later uplifted and tilted to their present angle by the mountain building forces that formed the Uinta Mountains during the Laramide orogeny. Erosion later exposed the layers at the surface to be found by paleontologists.

==History==
===Fremont people===

The Fremont people lived in the area of what is now Dinosaur National Monument before the 14th century, with archaeological evidence dating from 200 to 1300. Archaeologists first studied and named the Fremont culture along the Fremont River in south-central Utah and have since traced it through much of the Green and Colorado River drainages.

The Fremont did not build large permanent dwellings; instead, they lived in small bands within natural shelters, such as rock overhangs or shallow caves, or small villages. They consumed plant foods, such as pine nuts, berries, and cactus fruits, as well as wild game, including mule deer, bighorn sheep, smaller mammals, and birds. They also grew corn, beans, and squash, sometimes using irrigation techniques.

The fate of the Fremont culture is unclear. Recent theories suggest that the Fremont&#x27;s lifestyle may have changed due to drought or other climate factors, dwindling natural resources, or the influence of other neighboring cultures. They left evidence of their presence in the form of petroglyphs and pictographs of human and animal figures, and abstract designs. Human figures typically have trapezoidal bodies and elaborate decorations that suggest headdresses, earrings, necklaces, or shields. The animal figures include bighorn sheep, birds, snakes, and lizards. Purely abstract or geometric designs, such as circles, spirals, and various combinations of lines, are common. Many designs in the monument are accessible for close viewing, along four trails in Utah, one of which is near the visitor center, and a fifth trail in Colorado.

===Early scientific explorations===

The dinosaur fossil beds (bone beds) were discovered in 1909 by Earl Douglass, a paleontologist working and collecting for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. He and his crews excavated thousands of fossils and shipped them back to the museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for study and display.

===National monument===
President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the dinosaur beds as Dinosaur National Monument in 1915. The monument boundaries were expanded in 1938 from the original surrounding the dinosaur quarry in Utah, to in Utah and Colorado, encompassing the river canyons of the Green and Yampa.

=== Echo Park Dam controversy ===
The plans made by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on a ten-dam, billion dollar Colorado River Storage Project began to arouse opposition in the early 1950s when it was announced that one of the proposed dams would be at Echo Park, in the middle of Dinosaur National Monument. The controversy assumed major proportions, dominating conservation politics for years. David Brower, executive director of the Sierra Club, and Howard Zahniser of The Wilderness Society led an unprecedented nationwide campaign to preserve the free-flowing rivers and scenic canyons of the Green and Yampa Rivers. They argued that if a national monument was not safe from development, how could any wildland be kept intact?

On the other side of the argument were powerful members of Congress from western states, who were committed to the project in order to secure water rights, obtain cheap hydroelectric power and develop reservoirs as tourist destinations. After much debate, Congress settled on a compromise that eliminated Echo Park Dam and authorized the rest of the project. The Colorado River Storage Project Act became law on April 11, 1956. It stated, &quot;that no dam or reservoir constructed under the authorization of the Act shall be within any National Park or Monument.&quot;

==Climate==
The Dinosaur National Monument sits on a vast area of desert land in Northwestern Colorado and Northeastern Utah. Typical of high deserts, summer temperatures can be exceedingly hot, while winter temperatures can be very cold. Snowfall is common, but the snow melts rapidly in the arid and sunny climates of these states. Rainfall is very low, and the evaporation rate classifies the area as desert, even though the rainfall exceeds 10 inches.

== Features ==
===The quarry===

The &quot;Wall of Bones&quot; located within the Dinosaur Quarry building in the park consists of a steeply tilted (67° from horizontal) rock layer which contains thousands of dinosaur fossils. The preserved section is only a portion of what was originally present when Douglass made his discovery as seen on the map above. When work ceased in 1922, a portion of the quarry was left for future development. This work began as part of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Civil Works Administration, which provided employment during the Depression under the Transient Relief Service and later under the Works Progress Administration. This work included constructing a road to the quarry, removal of overburden covering the bone-bearing strata, and building of a small, temporary museum. World War II interrupted work, but this was resumed in 1951 with the building of a small metal building over the east portion of the quarry to test whether bone was abundant enough to warrant a larger, more permanent building. This more permanent building was erected in the mid-1950s as part of the National Park Service Mission 66 plan. The architectural design was high controversial for its ultra-modern use of glass, steel and concrete ramp that spiraled around a cylindrical office tower. The building opened at the dedication ceremony on June 1, 1958. The design had two levels and abundant natural light so that visitors could watch technicians remove the hard rock to reveal the excavated fossil bones in-situ.

In July 2006, the Quarry Visitor Center was closed due to structural problems that since 1958 had plagued the building because it was built on unstable clay. The decision was made to build a new facility elsewhere in the monument to house the visitor center and administrative functions, making it easier to resolve the structural problems of the quarry building while still retaining a portion of the historic Mission 66 era exhibit hall. It was announced in April 2009 that Dinosaur National Monument would receive $13.1 million to refurbish and reopen the gallery as part of the Obama administration&#x27;s $750 billion stimulus plan. The Park Service successfully rebuilt the Quarry Exhibit Hall, supporting its weight on 70-foot steel micropile columns that extend to the bedrock below the unstable clay. The Dinosaur Quarry was reopened in Fall 2011.

<doc id="645562" wikidata="Q1974993" url="?curid=645562" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373">
<text>United Nations [[List of UN Security Council Resolutions|Security Council Resolution]] 1373, adopted unanimously on 28 September 2001, is a counterterrorism measure passed following the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States. The resolution was adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, and is therefore binding on all UN member states.

According to the official record of the meeting, the meeting convoked at 9:55 pm and adjourned at 10:00 pm. The five-minute meeting exemplified the Security Council&#x27;s working method, in which the meeting serves only as a public announcement of a decision that has already been reached in secret in &quot;informal consultations&quot;. Although the United States is widely credited with initiating Resolution 1373, once adopted unanimously, the resolution became a common act of the Security Council, and therefore all its members at the time had ownership over it.

== Aims of the resolution ==
The resolution aimed to hinder terrorist groups in various ways. It recalled provisions from resolutions 1189 (1998), 1269 (1999) and 1368 (2001) concerning terrorism. UN member states were encouraged to share their intelligence on terrorist groups in order to assist in combating international terrorism. The resolution also calls on all states to adjust their national laws so that they can ratify all of the existing international conventions on terrorism. It stated that all States &quot;should also ensure that terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offences in domestic laws and regulations and that the seriousness of such acts is duly reflected in sentences served.&quot;

The resolution established the Security Council&#x27;s Counter Terrorism Committee [CTC] to monitor state compliance with its provisions.

It also aimed at restricting immigration law, stating that &quot;before granting refugee status, all States should take appropriate measures to ensure that the asylum seekers had not planned, facilitated or participated in terrorist acts. Further, States should ensure that refugee status was not abused by the perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of terrorist acts, and that claims of political motivation were not recognized as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition of alleged terrorists.&quot;

However, the resolution failed to define &#x27;terrorism&#x27;, and the working group initially only added Al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime of Afghanistan on the sanctions list. This also entailed the possibility that authoritarian regimes could label even non-violent activities as terrorist acts, thus infringing upon basic human rights.

== Resolution 1456 (2003) ==

The absence of any specific reference to human rights considerations was remedied in part by Resolution 1456 (2003) which declared that &quot;States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, and should adopt such measures in accordance with international law, in particular, international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.&quot;

== Resolution 1566 ==
UN Security Council Resolution 1566 picked up loose ends from resolution 1373 by actually spelling out what the Security Council sees as terrorism:

Although this definition has operative effect for the purposes of Security Council action, it does not represent a definition of &quot;terrorism&quot; which binds all states in international law. That is a task which could only be achieved by way of agreeing to an international treaty under the auspices of the UN General Assembly. Negotiations towards agreeing to such are ongoing, and a Comprehensive Convention exists in draft form, however agreement to its exact terms, most particularly the definition of &quot;terrorism&quot;, remains elusive.

Resolution 1566 also called for the creation of a working group that will expand the list of terrorist entities under sanction beyond the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

== National implementation ==
Most states complied with the resolution, with varying willingness (Mexico and Venezuela being quite reluctant, especially concerning the freezing of assets of persons or groups whom they had no evidence of involvement in terrorism), but only a few of them did so by explicitly referring to the UN resolution.

Russia implemented the resolution with great willingness – President of Russia Vladimir Putin translated the resolution into Russian and enacted it as domestic law by 10 January 2002 in the decree of the president of the Russian Federation No 6 on Measures Towards the Implementation of UN Security Resolution 1373.

On 1 April 2014, the Government of Sri Lanka signed an order designating 16 organisations functioning as terrorist fronts on foreign soil freezing all assets and economic resources of those, using this resolution.

== CTC 2008 report ==
Recommendations of the Counter Terrorism Committee 2008 report included increased measures concerning illegal immigration (considered, without evidence, as a serious risk to security) as well as:
*to &quot;Promote inter-agency coordination and the exchange of counter-terrorism information at the national, regional and international levels&quot;;
*to &quot;Encourage States to establish dedicated and permanent counter-terrorism units, with the assistance of experts seconded from various specialized institutions, in areas such as criminal law, counter-financing of terrorism and border control&quot;;
*to &quot;Encourage greater cooperation with INTERPOL and increased utilization of its resources and databases, such as red notices and watch lists&quot; (Interpol created in 2002 the Interpol Terrorism Watch List).

== Criticism ==
Oxford University public law professor Stefan Talmon argued that this resolution is an example of the United Nations Security Council veering into legislating law in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks when its role is to apply and interpret international law.

<doc id="645564" wikidata="Q15125" url="?curid=645564" title="Dent Blanche">
<text>The Dent Blanche is a mountain in the Pennine Alps, lying in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. At -high, it is one of the highest peaks in the Alps.

==Naming==

The original name was probably &quot;Dent d&#x27;Hérens&quot;, the current name of the nearby Dent d&#x27;Hérens which does not overlook the Val d&#x27;Hérens. The nearby north face of the Dent d&#x27;Hérens is glaciated while the Dent Blanche holds much less snow, it was even called &quot;Dent Noire&quot; (&quot;Black Tooth&quot;) on the Woerl Atlas of 1842. In fact on older maps, in the area where both summits lie, only the name &quot;Weisszahnhorn&quot; (from German: &quot;White Tooth Peak&quot;) was given, the French name (&quot;Dent Blanche&quot;) only appearing in 1820. Because cartographers usually made their observations far from the mountainous remote areas and also because the Dent d&#x27;Hérens is sometime hidden behind the Dent Blanche thus less visible, the latter received the name. The inhabitants of the lower Val d&#x27;Hérens called the current Dent d&#x27;Hérens, &quot;Dent Blanche&quot;, but the ones of the upper Val d&#x27;Hérens called the mountain, &quot;Dent de Rong&quot; or &quot;Dent d&#x27;Erins&quot;, contributing to the general confusion. The contemporary names are official since the completion of the Dufour map in 1862.

== Geography ==
The summit of Dent Blanche is an important geographic place as it is the converging point of three ridges. The three valleys separated by them are the Val d&#x27;Hérens, Val d&#x27;Anniviers and Mattertal. The respective villages of Evolène, Zinal and Zermatt lie approximatively at the same distance of the mountain.

The Dent Blanche has four steep faces rising over four glaciers: The north-east face (also called &quot;north face&quot;) rises above the Grand Cornier Glacier (part of the Zinal Glacier), the south-east face rises above the Schönbiel Glacier (part of the Zmutt Glacier), the south-west face rises above the Manzettes Glacier (part of the Ferpècle Glacier) and, finally, the north-west face of Dent Blanche rises above the homonym glacier.

The four ridges encompass almost exactly the four cardinal directions. The west ridge is named &quot;Arête de Ferpècle&quot; and the east ridge is named &quot;Arête des Quatre Ânes&quot;. The &quot;Col de la Dent Blanche&quot; (3,531 m) lies at the foot of the northern ridge, the Bivouac de la Dent Blanche is located there. The Dent Blanche Hut lies at the foot of the southern ridge which is used as the normal route. The grade of the route is AD (III+).

The region around Dent Blanche consists of many 4000 metres peaks. The Ober Gabelhorn (west), Dent d&#x27;Hérens and Matterhorn (south) are the closest high summits.

== Climbing history ==

The first ascent was made via the south ridge (Wandfluegrat), which is the less difficult route to the summit and the actual normal route. On 12 July 1862, T. S. Kennedy, after an attempt on the east face of the unconquered Matterhorn, almost reached the summit with the guides Peter Taugwalder and his son. But after a minor accident, Peter Taugwalder refused to go any higher. Kennedy would finally reach the summit only a few days later, on July 18, 1862 with W. Wigram, J. Croz and J. Konig, despite adverse weather conditions.

A route on the east ridge was opened on 11 August 1882 by John Stafford Anderson and G. P. Baker, with guides Alois Pollinger of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais and Ulrich Almer. They started from the Mountet Hut and arrived at the summit after a difficult 12 hours climbing on a dangerous ridge overlooking the north face. Almer said on the summit, &quot;We are four asses&quot;, and the ridge was then named &quot;Arête des Quatre Ânes&quot; or &quot;Viereselsgrat&quot; (&quot;Ridge of the Four Asses&quot;).

The north ridge was explored in 1899. On 28 August O. G. Jones, F. W. Hill with guides E. Furrer, C. Zurbriggen and J. Vuignier headed to the summit but they fell and only Hill survived. He reached alone the summit and a storm forced him to make a bivouac. He could report the news of the fatal accident in Zermatt only two days later.

The first ascent of the north north west ridge – described as &quot;one of the last great problems&quot; of the Pennine Alps – was by Dorothy Pilley Richards and I. A. Richards with Joseph Georges and Antoine Georges on 20 July 1928. Dorothy Pilley Richards later wrote up the ascent in her mountaineering memoir, &quot;Climbing Days&quot; (1935).

The first ascent of the north face is attributed to K. Schneider and F. Singer on 26 and 27 August 1932. They climbed from the left part at the base of the face to the summit. Only on 12 July 1966, Michel and Yvette Vaucher made a direct ascent on the north face.

The first winter ascent by the north ridge was completed by P. Crettaz and J. Gaudin on March 2, 1963.

A solo winter ascent on the north face was made for the first time in 1968 by C. Bournissen.

<text>Revolt Against the Modern World () is a book by Julius Evola, first published in Italy in 1934. Described as Evola&#x27;s most influential work, it is an elucidation of his Traditionalist world view. The first part of the book deals with the concepts of the Traditional world; its knowledge of the bridge between the earthly and the transcendent worlds. The second part deals with the modern world, contrasting its characteristics with those of traditional societies: from politics and institutions to views on life and death. Evola denounces the regressive aspects of modern civilisation, and instead argues for a traditionalist society.
&quot;Rivolta contro il mondo moderno&quot; was published in Milan by Hoepli in 1934. A revised and augmented edition was published in 1969. Translated into English by Guido Stucco (from the 1969 edition), it was published by Inner Traditions. It has also been translated into German, Spanish, French, Serbian and Hungarian. The book influenced Mircea Eliade and other thinkers in the Traditionalist school, as well as the European &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;.

==Contents==
&quot;Revolt Against the Modern World&quot; is divided into two parts: The World of Tradition, and Genesis and the Face of the Modern World.

The first part, the world of tradition, is a comparative study of the doctrines of traditional civilizations where Evola indicates that the fundamental principles of the life of traditional man are manifested in the doctrine of two natures, the existence of a physical order and a metaphysical one. It follows the indication of the way in which the man of the tradition conceives law, war, property, relations between the sexes, immortality, and race. The second part instead contains an interpretation of history on a traditional basis: it starts from the origins of man to arrive at the modern concept of evolution in the Darwinian sense which, according to tradition, is considered a regress, an involution.

Evola begins the second chapter of Revolt against the Modern World stating that the traditional world is never perfectly realized in history. According to Evola, the key to tradition and what he supposes was the defining feature of the traditional world, was the experiential knowledge of the two natures: high and low, being and becoming, supernatural and natural. Then, Evola leads to promote the beneficial qualities of historical societies that embodied tradition: &quot;The traditional world knew divine kingship. It knew the bridge between the two worlds, namely, initiation; it knew the two great ways of approaching the transcendent, namely, heroic action and contemplation. It knew the moral foundation, namely, the traditional law and the caste system; and it knew the political earthly symbol, namely, the empire.&quot; 

From this, Evola concludes that the traditional world had no defining ethics so therefore, it had no theory of any kind. Without theory, there was no learning of such theory and without learning, no progress. Evola explains how any progress or change from these traditional societies is involution rather than evolution, the study of history is only the study of decay. Evola appreciates how due to this, in traditional societies there was only adherence to the primordialism, a single ethnic identity, which he believes has been lost due to modernity.

Once Evola characterizes traditional societies, he proceeds to dive into his metaphysical views of gender roles. As Evola divides the universe between above and below, he relates this to the supernatural and the natural. According to Evola, women are natural and men are supernatural. The male is self-subsistent while the female is dependent. In Evola&#x27;s worldview, the role of the female is to be a mother and a lover, while the male&#x27;s sole role is in war. Evola grounds these views on gender roles by relating them to Hinduism and Taoism in particular.

<doc id="645574" wikidata="Q2319796" url="?curid=645574" title="Killer (Finnish band)">
<text>Killer was a rock band founded in 1999 in Helsinki, Finland. Although Killer was a quartet, vocalist Siiri Nordin was by far the most visible member.

== History ==
The group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Hurricane&quot; was released in February 2001. In August 2001 the debut was followed up by &quot;All I Want&quot; – a track that topped the local airplay list and made it to No. 2 on the charts, moving the band&#x27;s debut album &#x27;Sickeningly Pretty And Unpleasantly Vain&#x27; up to gold.

Their second album, &quot;Sure You Know How To Drive This Thing&quot; was internationally released in 2003 and entered the Finnish charts at position 7. &quot;Sure You Know How To Drive This Thing&quot; includes the song &quot;Naughty Boy&quot; which became the band&#x27;s biggest hit. The song was one of the most played songs on Finnish radio during the summer of 2003; it also made it to number one on the MTV&#x27;s &quot;Up North&quot; charts. One year later, Killer were invited to play at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany.

On February 5, 2005, bass player Timo Huhtala announced on the band&#x27;s website the group will take an &quot;undetermined break&quot;;

As a result, Timo and Teijo formed their new band Killer Aspect, the name being a combination of the band names &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Personal Aspect&quot; – the former band of the guitarist.

==Dynasty==
Killer, along with Kwan and The Rasmus, were part of the initially unofficial association Dynasty, a loose association which joined the disparate bands. The association was found out of a friendship and joined interests and resulted in several co-operations: The Rasmus&#x27; members Lauri Ylönen and Pauli Rantasalmi produced both Killer&#x27;s and Kwan&#x27;s (the latter one only Rantasalmi) albums, Siiri appeared on Kwan&#x27;s tracks &quot;Padam&quot; and &quot;Chillin&#x27; at the Grotto&quot; and Aki Hakala first played drums for Killer, later for Kwan before finally joining The Rasmus. Lauri also contributed lyrics to a special version of Killer&#x27;s &quot;All I Want&quot; which was released as a b-side on the single.

<doc id="645580" wikidata="Q327911" url="?curid=645580" title="Trampoline">
<text>A trampoline is a device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched between a steel frame often using many coiled springs. People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes.

The fabric that users bounce on (commonly known as the &quot;bounce mat&quot; or &quot;trampoline bed&quot;) is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy.

==History==

=== Early trampoline-like devices ===


A game similar to trampolining was developed by the Inuit, who would toss blanket dancers into the air on a walrus skin one at a time (see Nalukataq) during a spring celebration of whale harvest. There is also some evidence of people in Europe having been tossed into the air by a number of people holding a blanket. Mak in the Wakefield Mystery Play &quot;The Second Shepherds&#x27; Play&quot;, and Sancho Panza in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, are both subjected to blanketing – however, these are clearly non-voluntary, non-recreational instances of quasi-judicial, mob-administered punishment. The trampoline-like life nets once used by firefighters to catch people jumping out of burning buildings were invented in 1887.

The 19th-century poster for Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus Royal refers to performance on trampoline. The device is thought to have been more like a springboard than the fabric-and-coiled-springs apparatus presently in use.

These may not be the true antecedents of the modern sport of trampolining, but indicate that the concept of bouncing off a fabric surface has been around for some time. In the early years of the 20th century, some acrobats used a &quot;bouncing bed&quot; on the stage to amuse audiences. The bouncing bed was a form of small trampoline covered by bedclothes, on which acrobats performed mostly comedy routines.

According to circus folklore, the trampoline was supposedly first developed by an artiste named du Trampolin, who saw the possibility of using the trapeze safety net as a form of propulsion and landing device and experimented with different systems of suspension, eventually reducing the net to a practical size for separate performance. While trampoline-like devices were used for shows and in the circus, the story of du Trampolin is almost certainly apocryphal. No documentary evidence has been found to support it.

William Daly Paley of Thomas A. Edison, Inc. filmed blanket tossing initiation of a new recruit in Company F, 1st Ohio Volunteers in 1898.

===First modern trampolines===
The first modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold in 1936. Nissen was a gymnastics and diving competitor and Griswold was a tumbler on the gymnastics team, both at the University of Iowa, United States. They had observed trapeze artists using a tight net to add entertainment value to their performance and experimented by stretching a piece of canvas, in which they had inserted grommets along each side, to an angle iron frame by means of coiled springs. It was initially used to train tumblers but soon became popular in its own right. Nissen explained that the name came from the Spanish &quot;trampolín&quot;, meaning a diving board. Nissen had heard the word on a demonstration tour in Mexico in the late 1930s and decided to use an anglicized form as the trademark for the apparatus.

In 1942, Griswold and Nissen created the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline &amp; Tumbling Company, and began making trampolines commercially in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

The generic term for the trademarked trampoline was a &quot;rebound tumbler&quot; and the sport began as &quot;rebound tumbling&quot;. It has since lost its trademark and has become a generic trademark.
Early in their development Nissen anticipated trampolines being used in a number of recreational areas, including those involving more than one participant on the same trampoline. One such game was Spaceballa game of two teams of two, or played between two individuals, on a single trampoline with specially constructed end &quot;walls&quot; and a middle &quot;wall&quot; through which a ball could be propelled to hit a target on the other side&#x27;s end wall. Spaceball was created by Nissen together with Scott Carpenter and was used in space training at NASA.

===Use in flight and astronaut training===
During World War II, the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators, giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before. After the war, the development of the space flight programme again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet astronauts, giving them experience of variable body positions in flight.

===Competitive sports===

The first Trampoline World Championships were organised by Ted Blake of Nissen, and held in London in 1964. The first World Champions were both American, Dan Millman and Judy Wills Cline. Cline went on to dominate and become the most highly decorated trampoline champion of all time.

One of the earliest pioneers of trampoline as a competitive sport was Jeff Hennessy, a coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Hennessy also coached the United States trampoline team, producing more world champions than any other person. Among his world champions was his daughter, Leigh Hennessy. Both Jeff and Leigh Hennessy are in the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

The competitive gymnastic sport of trampolining has been part of the Olympic Games since 2000. On a modern competitive trampoline, a skilled athlete can bounce to a height of up to , performing multiple somersaults and twists. Trampolines also feature in the competitive sport of Slamball, a variant of basketball, and Bossaball, a variant of volleyball.

===Cross-training for other sports===
There are a number of other sports that use trampolines to help develop and hone acrobatic skills in training before they are used in the actual sporting venue. Examples can be found in diving, gymnastics, and freestyle skiing. One main advantage of trampolining as a training tool for other acrobatic sports is that it allows repetitive drill practice for acrobatic experience every two seconds or less, compared with many minutes with sports that involve hills, ramps or high platforms. In some situations, it can also be safer compared to landings on the ground.

===Wall running===

 Wall running is a sport where the participant uses a wall and platforms placed next to the trampoline bed to do tricks. The basic movement is a backdrop on the trampoline and then the feet touching the wall at the top of the bounce. From there, there is no limit to the acrobatic movements that are possible, similar to regular trampolining. The advantage is that twists and turns can be initiated more forcefully from a solid wall and that the vertical speed can be transferred to rotation in addition to forces from the legs or arms. Additionally, energy can be gained both from the bed at the bottom of the bounce, and from the wall at the top of the bounce.

==Types of trampolines==

===Recreational trampolines===

Recreational trampolines for home use are less sturdily constructed than competitive ones and their springs are weaker. They may be of various shapes, though most are circular, octagonal or rectangular. The fabric is usually a waterproof canvas or woven polypropylene material. As with competitive trampolines, recreational trampolines are usually made using coiled steel springs to provide the rebounding force, but spring-free trampolines also exist.

===Competitive trampolines===
 The frame of a competitive trampoline is made of steel and can be made to fold up for transportation to competition venues. The trampoline bed is rectangular in size fitted into the frame with around 110 steel springs (the actual number may vary by manufacturer). The bed is made of a strong fabric that can be woven from webbing, which is the most commonly used material.

===Bungee trampolines===

A bungee trampoline is an attraction at many fairs, holiday resorts and several summer camps. Some cruise ships have bungee trampolines on board and some ski resorts in the summer. There are different models that range in ease of use and also in ease of setup. Some are on trailers and the number of trampoline mats varies for different models, with four being the most common. There are hydraulic models along with winch models depending on the age and manufacturer of the unit. The bungee cords allow for people without experience in gymnastics to perform flips and other manoeuvres that they wouldn’t be able to execute safely without the additional jumping height.

===Water trampolines===

Despite being an inflatable device, unlike closed inflatable trampolines, a water trampoline&#x27;s elasticity is typically not caused by it being inflated. It follows the same principle as a standard land-based trampoline: a bounce mat held by springs. These models allow for a way to combine swimming and trampoline recreation, making it popular for rental amongst lakeside homeowners.

==Commercial trampoline parks==

In 1959 and 1960, it became very popular to have outdoor commercial &quot;jump centres&quot; or &quot;trampoline parks&quot; in many places in North America where people could enjoy recreational trampolining. However, these tended to have a high accident rate, and the public&#x27;s interest rapidly waned.

In the early 21st century, indoor commercial trampoline parks have made a comeback, with a number of franchises operating across the United States and Canada. ABC News has reported that in 2014 there were at least 345 trampoline parks operating in the United States. Similar parks have more recently been opened in other countries. The International Association of Trampoline Parks (IATP) estimated that park numbers had grown from 35-40 parks in 2011 to around 280 in 2014. The following year, IATP estimated that 345 parks were open by the end of 2014, and that another 115 would open by the end of 2015 in North America. IATP also estimated that at the end of 2014 there were 40 parks outside of North America, and that by the end of 2015 there would be at least 100 indoor trampoline parks open internationally. As of March 2019, CircusTrix (and its subsidiary Sky Zone) is the largest operator of trampoline parks in the U.S. and in the world, with 319 parks operating under their brands.

These commercial parks are located indoors, and have wall-to wall-trampolines to prevent people falling off the trampolines on to hard surfaces. Padded or spring walls protect people from impact injuries. Despite these precautions, there has been at least one death recorded due to a head-first landing at a trampoline park. In March 2012, New York Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain seriously injured his ankle while jumping at a commercial jump centre in Tampa with his son. In 2018, a man died in a British Columbia trampoline park, which prompted calls for more safety regulations for these popular activities.

==Safety==

Using a trampoline can be dangerous. Organized clubs and gyms usually have large safety end-decks with foam pads at each end, and spotters are placed alongside the trampoline to try to break the fall of any athlete who loses control and falls. In 1999, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated there were 100,000 hospital emergency room visits for trampoline injuries.

Due to the much larger numbers involved and lower safety standards, the majority of injuries occur on privately owned home trampolines or in commercial trampoline facilities rather than organized gyms.

CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Marketplace&quot; discovered that the trampoline park industry is unregulated in Canada, with different standards for padding and foam pit depth, self-inspections and repairs, and not being required to report injuries. It was also noted that there were generally too few staff to enforce rules, and that promotional advertisements often showed participants engaging in somersaults even though this was extremely dangerous without proper training. All trampoline parks rely upon liability waivers, where the signee assumes the risk of the activity including when injuries result from the establishment&#x27;s own negligence or poorly maintained equipment, rather than beefing up safety standards and supervision.

Bouncing off a trampoline can result in a fall of from the peak of a bounce to the ground or a fall into the suspension springs and frame. Some medical organizations have suggested that the devices be banned from home use.

Authorities recommend that only one person should be allowed to jump at a time to avoid collisions and people being catapulted in an unexpected direction or higher than they expect. One of the most common sources of injury is when multiple users are bouncing on the trampoline at one time. Often, this situation leads to users bouncing into one another and thus becoming injured; many suffer broken bones as a result of landing badly after knocking into another user.

Another of the most common sources of serious injury is an attempt to perform somersaults without proper training. In some cases, people land on their neck or head, which can cause paralysis or even death. In an infamous incident in the 1960s, pole-vaulting champion Brian Sternberg became paralyzed from the neck down in a trampoline accident.

Danger can be reduced by burying the trampoline so the bed is closer to the surrounding surface to lessen falling distance, and padding that surrounding area. Pads over the spring and frame reduce the severity of impact injuries. Keeping the springs covered also reduces the risk of a limb falling between the gaps in the springs and the rest of the body falling off the trampoline.

Kits are available for home trampolines that provide a retaining net around the trampoline and prevent users from bouncing over the edge. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that there is no epidemiological evidence that these improve safety. The nets do prevent jumpers falling off the trampoline onto the ground, but these falls are not the most common source of injury. Multiple users bouncing in a netted trampoline can still be injured. Safety net enclosures have a larger benefit for safeguarding solo trampolinists, so long as they avoid falling on their head or neck.

Having some training in a gym may be beneficial in alerting people to possible hazards and provide techniques to avoid bad falls.

Family-oriented commercial areas in North America, such as shopping centres, carnivals, and so on, often include closed inflatable trampolines (CITs) as a children&#x27;s attraction. These have safety nets on the sides to prevent injuries.

==Mini-trampolines==

A mini-trampoline (also known as a rebounder, trampette, jogging trampoline, or exercise trampoline) is a type of trampoline less than in diameter and about off the ground, often kept indoors and used as part of a physical fitness regime. So-called rebounding provides a form of exercise with a low impact on knees and joints. Mini-trampolines do not give a rebound as high as larger recreational or competitive trampolines. Most department and big-box stores sell mini-trampolines.

==Educational use==
Trampoline activity has been used by science teachers to illustrate Newton&#x27;s Three Laws of Motion, as well as the &quot;elastic collision.&quot;

<doc id="645581" wikidata="Q6664461" url="?curid=645581" title="Local number portability">
<text>Local number portability (LNP) for fixed lines, and full mobile number portability (FMNP) for mobile phone lines, refers to the ability of a &quot;customer of record&quot; of an existing fixed-line or mobile telephone number assigned by a local exchange carrier (LEC) to reassign the number to another carrier (&quot;service provider portability&quot;), move it to another location (&quot;geographic portability&quot;), or change the type of service (&quot;service portability&quot;). In most cases, there are limitations to transferability with regards to geography, service area coverage, and technology. Location Portability and Service Portability are not consistently defined or deployed in the telecommunication industry.

In the United States and Canada, mobile number portability is referred to as WNP or WLNP (Wireless LNP). In the rest of the world it is referred to as mobile number portability (MNP). Wireless number portability is available in some parts of Africa, Asia, Australia, Latin America and most European countries including Britain; however, this relates to transferability between mobile phone lines only. Canada, South Africa and the United States are the only countries that offer full number portability transfers between both fixed lines and mobile phone lines, because mobile and fixed line numbers are mixed in the same area codes, and are billed identically for the calling party, the mobile user usually pays for incoming calls and texts; in other countries all mobile numbers are placed in higher priced mobile-dedicated area codes and the originator of the call to the mobile phone pays for the call. The government of Hong Kong has tentatively approved fixed-mobile number portability; however, as of July 2012, this service is not yet available.

Some cellular telephone companies will charge for this conversion as a regulatory cost recovery fee.

==History==
LNP was invented by Edward Sonnenberg while working for Siemens.

Though it was introduced as a tool to promote competition in the heavily monopolized wireline telecommunications industry, number portability became popular with the advent of mobile telephones, since in most countries different mobile operators are provided with different area codes and, without portability, changing one&#x27;s operator would require changing one&#x27;s number. Some operators, especially incumbent operators with large existing subscriber bases, have argued against portability on the grounds that providing this service incurs considerable overhead, while others argue that it prevents vendor lock-in and allows them to compete fairly on price and service. Due to this conflict of interest, number portability is usually mandated for all operators by telecommunications regulatory authorities. In the US, LNP was mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1996. The mandate required all carriers in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to be &quot;LNP-capable&quot; and port numbers to any carriers sending a BFR (bona fide request). The ability to keep a number while switching providers is thought to be attractive to consumers. It was also a major point made by CLECs (competitive local exchange carriers) preventing customers from leaving ILECs (incumbent local exchange carriers), thus hindering competition. Details regarding the reasons for LNP and how it is to be implemented can be found in the First Report and Order referenced above.

In the US, the FCC has d this in order to increase competition among providers. As of late November 2003, LNP was required for all landline and wireless common carriers, so long as the number is being ported to the same geographical area or telephone exchange. This latest mandate included carriers outside the top 100 MSAs that previously enjoyed a rural carrier exemption.

==Portability schemes==
There are four main methods to route a number whose operator has changed.
===All Call Query (ACQ)===
The operator that originates the call always checks a centralized database and obtains the route to the call.
The originating operator then routes the call to Serving Network.

===Query on Release (QoR)===
The operator that originates the call first checks with the operator to which the number initially belonged, the donor operator. The donor operator verifies the call and informs that it no longer possesses the number. The operator that originates the call then checks the centralized database, as is done with ACQ.

===Call Dropback===
Also known as Return to Pivot (RoP). The operator that originates the call first checks with the donor operator. The donor operator checks its own database and provides a new route. The operator that originates the call then uses this route to forward the call. No central database is consulted.

===Onward Routing (OR)===
The operator that originates the call routes the call to the donor operator. The donor operator checks its own database and obtains a new route. The operator to which the number was designated routes the call to the new operator. This model is called indirect routing.

==Technical issues==
Complexity for number portability can come from many sources. Historically, numbers were assigned to various operators in blocks. The operators, who were often also service providers, then provided these numbers to the subscribers of telephone services. Numbers were also recycled in blocks. With number portability, it is envisioned that the size of these blocks may grow smaller or even to single numbers. Once this occurs the granularity of such operations will represent a greater workload for the telecommunications provider.
With phone numbers assigned to various operators in blocks, the system worked quite well in a fixed line environment since everyone was attached to the same infrastructure. The situation becomes somewhat more complex in a wireless environment such as that created by cellular communications.

In number portability the “donor network” provides the number and the “recipient network” accepts the number. The operation of donating a number requires that a number be “snapped out” from a network and “snapped into” the receiving network. If the subscriber ceases to need the number then it is normal that the original donor receive the number back and “snaps back” the number to its network. The situation is slightly more complex if the user leaves the first operator for a second and then subsequently elects to use a third operator. In this case the second operator will return the number to the first and then it is assigned to the third.

In cellular communications the concept of a location registry exists to tie a “mobile station” (such as a cellular phone) to the number. If a number is dialed it is necessary to be able to determine where in the network the mobile station exists. Some mechanism for such forwarding must exist. (For an example of such a system, see the article on the GSM network.)

In the US, there are standards for portability defined by the FCC, the LNPA, NANPA and the ATIS which are agreed upon by all member providers to help make LNP as cost-efficient and expedient as possible while still retaining a healthy level security for all providers and in respect of the highest level of customer service. These rules, first defined in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Reports and Orders by the FCC (publicly available at fcc.gov), are further detailed by the LNPA in order to ensure any provider can successfully port numbers to any other provider. iconectiv provides a national database called the NPAC (National Portability Administration Center) which contains the correct routing information for all ported and pooled numbers in the US and Canada. The NPAC maintains detailed documentation of the procedure common among US carriers to port numbers as described here.

Providers use SS7 to route calls throughout the US/Canada network. SS7 accesses databases for various services such as CNAM, LIDB, VSC and LNP. Calls to ported numbers are completed when a customer who calls a ported number sends the dialed number to a provider&#x27;s SSP (Service Switch Point), where it is identified either as a local call or not. If the call is local, the switch has the NPA-NXX in its routing table as portable, so it sends a routing request to the Signal Transfer Point (STP) which accesses a local database that is updated by an LSMS (Local Service Management System) which holds all routing for all ported numbers to which the carrier is responsible for completing calls. If routing information is found, a response is sent to the &quot;query&quot; containing the information necessary to properly route the call. If it is not a local number, the call is passed on to the STP and routed until it gets to a local carrier who will perform the &quot;query&quot; mentioned earlier and route the call accordingly.

The routing information necessary to complete these calls is known as a Location Routing Number (LRN). The LRN is no more than a simple 10-digit telephone number that resides in the switch of the service provider currently providing service for the ported telephone number.

When a provider receives a request to port a telephone number from a new customer, that provider sends an industry-standard Local Service Request (LSR) to the existing (or &quot;old&quot;) provider. When the Old Provider receives this request, it sends back Firm Order Confirmation (FOC) and the process of porting the number(s) begins. Either provider can initiate the port using a Service Order Activator (SOA or LSOA) which directly edits the NPAC database mentioned before. Providers can also make these requests within the NPAC database directly. If the new provider initiates the port, it is called a &quot;pull,&quot; and if the old provider initiates, it is a &quot;push.&quot; Once the number is pulled or pushed, the providers must concur the request and the new provider must &quot;activate&quot; the number using the LRN of the switch serving the customer on the agreed due date. At the point this is completed, the number is ported.

Much of this process is duplicated in intermodal portability (porting between wireline and wireless providers). There are a few technical differences, however, in WLNP—Especially with concern to the time intervals allowed.

==Fax and paging numbers==
Some service providers, especially related to fax services, do not qualify as a &quot;local exchange carrier&quot; or other form of telecommunications carrier. Such service providers may be the &quot;customer of record&quot; from the LEC&#x27;s perspective. As a result, the applicable law may not require that such service provider port out the number to another provider. Users and providers often negotiate portability and port out fees. eFax is one vendor that claims it is not a telecommunications company and does not allow porting out of numbers originally assigned by them to their customers; however, numbers ported by customers into eFax may be ported out.

A fax machine connected to its own physical telephone line at the subscriber&#x27;s premises is portable in the same manner as any other standard wireline service. Distinctive ring sometimes poses problems, as one landline may have two or three numbers with a fax or dial-up modem programmed to answer just one of the secondary numbers on the line. Porting out the main number will usually unsubscribe the entire line, disconnecting the secondary numbers without moving them to the new provider.

In Canada, pocket pager answering services are exempted from all local number portability requirements. The same is not true of mobile telephones, which are fully portable to another carrier or another service type (such as landline or voice over IP) within the same local interconnection region.

==Portability by country==

===Africa===

====Kenya====
In Kenya, announced in 2004 that mobile number portability would be available as of July 1, 2005 and fixed-line number portability as of July 1, 2006. Mobile Number Portability was officially launched on April 1, 2011.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, announced Number Portability Company (Pty) Ltd (Reg. No. 2005/040348/07) was established in 2005 and Mobile Number Portability was introduced on 10 November 2006. Geographic Number Portability (between fixed operators) was introduced on 26 April 2010. The Mobile Number Portability Company is jointly owned by the mobile and fixed operators including Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom and Neotel.

===Americas===

====Argentina====
In Argentina, full mobile number portability is available since March 2012, being a law approved in 2000. It originally took up to ten working days to be effective. Since July 2017, however, takes up to a 24-hour period to be effective.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, number portability (both fixed and mobile) is available nationwide since March, 2009. However, it&#x27;s not possible to port a fixed line number to a mobile line number and vice versa
. It&#x27;s possible to carry the fixed line number within the same municipality and for mobile line number within the same area code (comprising from parts of a state to an entire state).

====Canada====
In Canada, wireline/competitive local exchange carriers must provide portability. As of March 14, 2007, wireless carriers must provide portability in most of Canada.

Numbers are only portable within a LIR (local interconnection region), regions defined by the ILEC and approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), each of which cover a number of exchanges. Each LIR has a Point of Interconnection (POI) exchange through which calls are routed, and if a number is ported out to a different LIR then calls to that destination will be rejected by the POI switch.

Not all exchanges support LNP, typically there needs to exist competition within an exchange before an ILEC will enable portability, and then only by request. Most small local independent telephone company exchanges are exempted from competition and local number portability requirements. Numbers in the rarely used non-geographic area code 600 are not portable.

====Dominican Republic====
In the Dominican Republic, number portability in both mobile and local telephony was launched September 30, 2009. In March, 2009, the Dominican Telecommunications Institute (INDOTEL) selected Informática El Corte Inglés to administer the number portability.

====Ecuador====
In Ecuador, Mobile Number Portability has been available since 12 October 2009.

====Mexico====
In the Mexico is first Latin American country to have number portability in both mobile and local telephony. The Federal Commission of Telecommunications (COFETEL) applied this law, in defense and regulation of the Telmex monopoly. It was also a condition for Telmex for entering the video market triple play. Number portability has been available since July 5, 2008. The service used to be administered by Telcordia Technologies.

On August 29, 2019, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) announced that at the request of the telecommunications service providers, it would migrate its portability database administration to Mediafon Datapro. As a result, portability was temporarily suspended from August 30 to September 1. On September 2, portability was resumed with the service now being handled by Mediafon Datapro.

====United States====
In the United States, (b)(2), added by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, requires all local exchange carriers (LECs) to offer number portability in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC implemented regulations on 27 June 1996, with LECs required to implement them in the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas by 1 October 1997 and elsewhere by 31 December 1998. (The regulations are currently located at , &quot;et seq.&quot;) The North American Numbering Council (NANC) was directed to select the Local Number Portability Administrators (LNPAs), akin to the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) which administers the North American Numbering Plan.

LNP was first implemented in the US upon the establishment of the original Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) in Chicago, Illinois, in 1998. This service covered select rate centers in the Ameritech region. Thereafter, as switches and telephone networks were upgraded with location routing number (LRN) capability, LNP was deployed sequentially to the remaining Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) areas. The FCC since has mandated &quot;Wireless Local Number Portability&quot; starting November 24, 2003 (in metropolitan areas) and allowed operators to charge an additional monthly &quot;Long-Term Telephone Number Portability End-Use Charge&quot; as compensation. On November 10, 2003, the FCC additionally ruled that number portability applies to landline numbers moving to mobile telephones and, on October 31, 2007, the FCC made clear that the obligation to provide LNP extends to VoIP providers.

Toll-free telephone numbers (area code +1-800) have been portable through the RespOrg system since 1993 in the US and 1994 in Canada.

===Asia===

====Hong Kong====
In Hong Kong, fixed line number portability is available since July 1, 1995, the same day of fixed line telephone market liberalization (i.e., reversal of franchised monopoly), which was a requirement from the government. Mobile number portability is available since March 1, 1999. Although the government allowed porting a fixed line number to a mobile carrier or vice versa, the introduction of this service shall be decided by the fixed/mobile carriers in a voluntary basis. As of October 2009, fixed-mobile number portability is not available.

====India====
In India, mobile number portability launched in the state of Haryana on November 25, 2010. It was finally launched all over India on January 20, 2011.
====Japan====
In Japan, fixed line portability began in March, 2001. (bangō portability seido – commonly referred to as portability or MNP) began on October 24, 2006. Users are able to change cellular phone carriers without changing their number for a fee of 5000 yen. However, e-mail addresses are subject to change, and music/data downloaded may become unusable.

The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) spent three years to put mobile number portability into practice, since its initial workgroup started in November, 2003. As a result, NTT DoCoMo, KDDI and Softbank accelerated the price battle, but it was of little effect due to already competitive price plans and customer loyalty. Overall, mobile number portability in Japan was not very successful, because of high transition costs for the customer due to SIM lock, the long time it took to establish mobile number portability, allowing operators to fence in subscribers with price plans, and the significance of mobile Internet mail.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, mobile number portability plan to start by mid-2008, according to an article on the National News Agency Bernama

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, () the PTA mandated mobile number portability on March 23, 2007. Users are able to change their cellular phone service for free. They just have to pay for new sim cards depending upon the provider they are migrating. Some companies even do not charge anything.

====Singapore====
Singapore was one of the first countries to introduce number portability for mobile telephones in 1997. This is currently implemented through voice call &amp; SMS forwarding. True number portability was realized from June 13, 2008, with the implementation of a Centralised Number Portability Database Solution, as proposed by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore.
====South Korea====
In South Korea, mobile number portability service started from January 1, 2004. One thing different from 
other countries is that it started from SK Telecom, the dominant operator which has over 50% of market share. To prevent users&#x27; churning to the dominant operator, the government gave six months&#x27; and one year&#x27;s delay to the second and the third operator, respectively. As a result, only SK Telecom&#x27;s subscribers could move to other operators during the first six months.

==== Sri Lanka ====
In Sri Lanka, mobile number portability service started in August 2007. This is supported by Sri Lanka Telecom owned Mobitel Lanka and other cellular operators.

===Europe===
In the European Union, all telephone providers are required to provide number portability under the &quot;Universal Services Directive (2002/22/EU)&quot;.

====Albania====
In Albania, mobile number portability was implemented in 04.05.2011 (AKEP) . For fixed-line numbers, it started on some geographical areas in September 2012 and was available in all country by 01.04.2013 (AKEP) .

====Austria====
In Austria, number portability was implemented in October 2004.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, number portability was implemented in October 2002.

====Cyprus====
In Cyprus, geographic, non-geographic and mobile number portability is required as of July 12, 2004.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, portability of fixed line numbers and ISDN was implemented on January 1, 2001. Mobile number portability was implemented on July 1, 2001. In 2006, 238,293 fixed lines were ported, along with 456,159 mobile lines. Considering that the number of fixed lines by the end of 2006 was 2,974,000 and the number of mobile lines was 5.828.000, roughly 7.9% of lines were ported in 2006.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, number portability is required from fixed operators since January 1, 2004 and should be required from mobile operators as from January 1, 2005.

====Finland====
In Finland, mobile number portability was implemented on July 25, 2003. The impact of mobile number portability in Finland exceeds that of other countries. In one year (June 2003 – June 2004), the combined market share of TeliaSonera, Elisa and DNA fell from 98.7% to 87.9%.

====France====
In France, geographic number portability has been available since January 1, 1998. As of January 1, 2001, it became possible to change geographic location or operator while keeping the same number. Mobile number portability was introduced on June 30, 2003. However, due to its lack of effectiveness, a new system was launched on May 21, 2007 with two objectives: having a single contact for the customer (the new operator should take all the steps towards mobile number portability) and a maximum period of ten days for mobile number portability to have effect.

====Germany====
In Germany, fixed number portability was introduced on January 1, 1998, for geographic numbers and numbers for non-geographic services. Mobile number portability was implemented on November 1, 2002.

====Greece====
In Greece, fixed number portability is available since January 1, 2003. Mobile number portability was implemented on March 1, 2004.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, portability exists for geographic numbers since January 1, 2004. Portability for non-geographic numbers (including mobile numbers) is available since May 1, 2004. There has been added a special area code +36 21, which legally allows the phone number to be anywhere in the world, beside having the +36 country code prefix.

====Ireland====
In Ireland, local number portability was implemented in 2000, using an IN solution with a shared routing database. Partial mobile number portability was introduced in 1997 with full portability becoming available in 2003.

====Italy====
In Italy, mobile number portability is available since April 30, 2002.

==== Luxembourg ====
In Luxembourg, mobile number portability introduced in June 2004. The Mobile Number Portability Central (MNPC) managed by the G.I.E Telcom E.I.G. operator group and developed, installed and operated by Systor Trondheim AS of Norway, was put into commercial operations from February 2005.

==== Norway ====
In Norway, Fixed number portability was introduced in 2000, one year before the introduction of mobile number portability. The administrative solution for fixed and mobile number portability in Norway, the National Reference Database (NRDB), was put into service in 2000. The NRDB is owned and managed by the 8 largest network operators in Norway through the company NRDB AS. The reference database was developed, installed and is presently operated by Systor Trondheim AS.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, fixed number portability was implemented on June 30, 2001. Mobile number portability has been available since January 1, 2002.
The administrative Reference Entity (Entidade de Referencia (ER)) interconnecting all network operators and service providers is operated by a local third party, Portabil S.A. , a joint venture between the internationally well known companies Logica and Systor Trondheim AS.

====Slovakia====
In Slovakia, number portability was implemented in May 2004.

====Spain====
In Spain, number portability among cell phone carriers is available since October 1, 2000, without any cost to the end user. The technical details for the process are regulated by the CMT &quot;(Comisión del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones&quot; or Telecoms Market Commission) and all carriers are obliged to comply with their requirements. As of August 2007, cell number portability must complete in 5 business days (i.e. excluding weekends) from the moment the request is confirmed by the customer, with the actual switch occurring late at night to avoid missing any calls. The user wakes up using a new SIM-card from the new cell provider while keeping the number.

In the mature Spanish cell phone market (as of June 2007, with 107 lines per 100 inhabitants ), portability has been widely used by the competing carriers as a way to steal each other&#x27;s customers, usually offering them free handsets or extra credit. From June 2006 to June 2007 alone, 3,957,556 cell phone lines switched carriers via this proceeding, about 10% of all cellular lines in use. Spain is the one country in the European Union where more customers have switched cell phone providers, with more than 9 million carrier switches completed as of April 2007.

As for the fixed line market, number portability is also available since year 2000, but weaker competition meant that actual adoption of the fixed number portability process was quite sluggish. As of August 2004, 1,041,246 fixed line switches were completed.

Fixed line market is peculiar in Spain, since only two local loop providers can operate at each particular region (or &quot;demarcación&quot; as regulated by the CMT): a cable carrier (such as Ono, R and many others) and the former State monopoly (Telefónica). The sole of them operating statewide—Telefónica—is obliged to provide other firms with access to their exchange facilities or rental/transfer of their copper last-mile loops, at fees regulated by the CMT (practice known as local loop unbundling). As cable providers do not have a statewide footprint, many users have no actual chance of applying for &quot;true&quot; fixed number portability, that is, giving up Telefónica&#x27;s service altogether. Some of them can however get their service from a third company who will bill the service and then pay Telefónica for the copper pair rental and maintenance fees, with the customer receiving a single bill. In the end, as Telefónica set up a reselling program for their fixed lines and DSL internet access, the former monopoly is still much in control of the fixed line market, including profitable broadband access. In fact, Telefónica was fined in excess of €152 million by the European Commission on July 4, 2007 on ground of &quot;impeding competition on the Spanish broadband internet access market for more than five years, and so depriving consumers and business of a choice of broadband suppliers&quot;.

Due to the billing scheme used throughout Europe and most of the world, where the calling party assumes the full cost of the call, and calling a cellphone is usually more expensive than calling a fixed line, a distinction must be made between cellphone numbers (beginning with &quot;6&quot; or, from October 2011, &quot;71&quot;, &quot;72&quot;, &quot;73&quot; or &quot;74&quot;, ) and fixed numbers (usually beginning with 9 or 8). Full number portability in which a customer transfers a cell to a fixed number or vice versa is thus not possible. See Telephone numbering in Spain for more information.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, fixed line portability was implemented in 1999 and mobile number portability was implemented on September 1, 2001. At the introduction of mobile number portability the Swedish operators joined forces and procured a central solution, SNPAC CRDB, which is a central reference database now containing both the fixed and mobile portings.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, mobile number portability is available since March 1, 2000, and land line number portability since April 2002.

==== Turkey ====
In Turkey, mobile number portability was implemented in Nov 2008. Fixed number portability was initially planned to take place exactly 6 months following the mobile number portability, on May 9, 2009. However, it was not until September 9, 2009 that the regulator approved the procedure for fixed number portability. Since then, fixed and mobile operators, and the incumbent, are working to get the process going and performing interoperability tests. However, there is still progress to be made and the progress for fixed number portability has not proved to be going ahead as in-time as the mobile number portability.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, Ofcom directs fixed-line telephone network providers, mobile phone providers and broadband service providers to provide number portability under the Porting Authorisation Code rules and Migration Authorisation Code code of practice respectively. As the UK was an EU member country, the Ofcom direction was intended to reflect the requirements of EU Directive 2002/22/EU.

====Serbia====
In Serbia, number portability service on public telephone networks at a fixed location is available as of 1 April 2014.

===Middle East===

====Israel====
In Israel, number portability is free and takes 15 minutes. All cellular lines can be ported, Landline numbers may be ported, except between regions (area codes). Wireless and VoIP companies each have a single area code for the whole country. Within it, numbers may be ported with no regard to geographic area.

There is no porting between landline and cellular lines.
(date implemented? http://www.moc.gov.il/new/documents/engineering/faq_24.8.05.pdf )

====Oman====
In Oman, Mobile Number Portability was mandated on the Public Mobile Operators, Nawras and Oman Mobile, via the licenses issued to them by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). Mobile number portability was launched on August 26, 2006. Users are able to change cellular phone carriers without changing their number for a nominal fee of 3 OMR.

====Saudi Arabia====
In Saudi Arabia mobile number portability was launched on July 8, 2006, to be the first country to launch this service in the ME region. A centralized number portability clearinghouse (NPC) solution was implemented by CITC(the telecom regulation authority) and the two mobile phone operators were obliged to implement the MNP solution in their networks and to interface with the NPC. the service was provided to the mobile subscribers for free.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, local telephone numbers have been portable since 1999. The porting process is based on a peer-to-peer file exchange between fixed line operators. According to ACMA, local number portability came into full effect at the start of 2000. Mobile number portability has been available as of September 25, 2001.

For service providers who require knowledge of porting activity to enable them to deliver voice calls directly to the current &quot;network owner&quot;, they can either form agreements with all of the fixed-line operators, or use a third-party LNP provider, such as Paradigm.One.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, local and mobile number portability (LMNP) began on April 1, 2007. The rules governing LMNP originate in the Number Portability Determination. Ports are authorised, scheduled, and coordinated via a centralised number portability system called IPMS (Industry Portability Management System). All networks update their own routing and confirm this to IPMS. There are now 26 carriers and service providers that participate in LMNP in New Zealand, over a million numbers have been ported.

<text>Tweezers are small hand tools used for grasping objects too small to be easily handled with the human fingers. Tweezers are thumb-driven forceps most likely derived from tongs used to grab or hold hot objects since the dawn of recorded history. In a scientific or medical context, they are normally referred to as just &quot;forceps&quot;, a name that is used together with other grasping surgical instruments that resemble pliers, pincers and scissors-like clamps.

Tweezers make use of two third-class levers connected at one fixed end (the point of each lever), with the pincers at the others. When used, they are commonly held with one hand in a pen grip between the thumb and index finger (sometimes also the middle finger), with the top end resting on the first dorsal interosseous muscle at the webspace between the thumb and index finger. Spring tension holds the grasping ends apart until finger pressure is applied. This provides an extended pinch and allows the user to easily grasp, manipulate and quickly release small or delicate objects with readily variable pressure.

People commonly use tweezers for such tasks as plucking hair from the face or eyebrows, often using the term eyebrow tweezers. Other common uses for tweezers are as a tool to manipulate small objects, including for example small, particularly surface-mount, electronic parts, and small mechanical parts for models and precision mechanisms. Stamp collectors use tweezers (stamp tongs) to handle postage stamps which, while large enough to pick up by hand, could be damaged by handling; the jaws of stamp tongs are smooth. Another example of a specialized use is picking out the flakes of gold in gold panning. Tweezers are also used in kitchens for food presentation to remove bones from fillets of fish in a process known as pin boning, and are as tongs used to serve pieces of cake to restaurant patrons.

==History==


Tweezers are known to have been used in predynastic Egypt. There are drawings of Egyptian craftsmen holding hot pots over ovens with a double-bow shaped tool. Asiatic tweezers, consisting of two strips of metal brazed together, were commonly used in Mesopotamia and Ancient India from about 3000 BC, perhaps for purposes such as catching lice. During the Bronze Age, tweezers were manufactured in Kerma.

In the 17th century, this instrument was known in Early Modern English primarily as a &quot;Volfella&quot;, or a &quot;Puller&quot;, and also known in Latin as an &quot;Acantabolus&quot;, whilst the name &quot;Tweezer&quot; was also being used.

The word tweezer comes from etwee which describes a small case that people would use to carry small objects (such as toothpicks) with them. Etwee takes its origin from French &quot;étui&quot; &quot;small case&quot; from the Old French verb &quot;estuier&quot;, &quot;to hold or keep safe.&quot; Over time, the object now known as &quot;tweezers&quot; took on this name because the tool was commonly found in these tiny carrying cases. Eventually, the word &quot;tweeze&quot; was accepted as a verb in the English language.

There is evidence of Roman shipbuilders pulling nails out of construction with plier-type pincers.

==Types==
Tweezers come in a variety of tip shapes and sizes. Blunt tip tweezers have a rounded end which can be used when a pointed object may get entangled, when manipulating cotton swabs, for example. Flat tip tweezers, pictured at right, have an angled tip which may be used for removing splinters. Some tweezers have a long needle-like tip which may be useful for reaching into small crevices. Triangular tip tweezers have larger, wider tips useful for gripping larger objects. Tweezers with curved tips also exist, sometimes called bent forceps. Microtweezers have an extremely small, pointed tip used for manipulating tiny electronic components and the like.

There are two common forms of construction for tweezers: two fused, angled pieces of metal, or one piece of metal bent in half. The bent tweezer is cheaper to manufacture, but gives weaker grip. The fused tweezer is more expensive, but allows for a stronger grip. The width between the tips of the tweezers when no force is applied also affects how powerful the grip is.
Cross-locking tweezers (aka reverse-action tweezers or self-closing tweezers) work in the opposite way to normal tweezers. Cross-locking tweezers open when squeezed and close when released, gripping the item without any exertion of the user&#x27;s fingers.

==Usage of traditional tweezers==
Applications:
* typesetting
* dealing with stamps (see Philately)
* dealing with smaller coins (see Numismatics), to protect the coins these are wrapped at the tips with plastic
* electronics
** soldering
* cosmetics
** hair removal (eyebrow tweezers)
** nail art (application of gems, stickers etc to fingernails or toenails as part of a manicure or pedicure respectively)
* semiconductor technology in the form of wafer tweezers
* medicine (Forceps and Tissue Forceps)
* household
* jewelry making
* textile industry as iron nubs
* science, laboratory
* aquascaping
* watchmaking

== Other kinds of tweezers ==
The original tweezers for mechanical gripping have given rise to a number of tools with similar action or purpose but not dependent upon mechanical pressure, including
*Optical tweezers use light to manipulate microscopic objects as small as a single atom. The momentum transfer from a focused laser beam is able to trap small particles. In the biological sciences, these instruments have been used to apply forces in the pico Newton range and to measure displacements in the nm range of objects ranging in size from 10 nm to over 100 mm.
*Magnetic tweezers use magnetic forces to manipulate single molecules (such as DNA) via paramagnetic interactions. In practice it is an array of magnetic traps designed for manipulating individual biomolecules and measuring the ultra-small forces that affect their behavior.

*Electric tweezers deliver an electrical signal through the tip, intended for depilation by damaging hair roots to prevent new hair from growing from the same root.
*Electrostatic tweezers use electrostatic voltage to induce the redistribution of charges in targeted objects, therefore generating Coulomb attraction force between tweezers and manipulated objects. Electrostatic tweezers work in a trapping mode or guiding mode.
*Vacuum tweezers use differences in atmospheric pressure to grasp items from 100 micrometres in size up to parts weighing several pounds. Special vacuum tweezer tips are manufactured to handle a wide variety of items such as surface-mount electronics, optics, biological material, stamps and coins. They may be used to handle parts that are so small that conventional mechanical tweezers may cause parts to be damaged or dropped and lost.
*Acoustic tweezers use sound to manipulate particles or cells in the fluid. An elegant Gor&#x27;kov potential theory is used most for small sizes compared with the incident wavelength.
*Molecular tweezers are noncyclic host molecules that have two arms capable of binding guests molecules through non-covalent bonding.
* Hot, or soldering, tweezers combine the squeezing action of mechanical tweezers with heating, to grip small surface-mount electronic devices while simultaneously heating them, for soldering or desoldering.
* Tweezer probes are a pair of electrical test probes fixed to a tweezer mechanism to measure voltages or other electronic circuit parameters between closely spaced pins.
* Tweezers integrated with an electronic measuring device for evaluation of electrical parameters of small-size electronic components.
* Carbon nano-tweezers have been fabricated by deposition of MWNT bundles on isolated electrodes deposited on tempered glass micropipettes. Those nanotube bundles can be mechanically manipulated by electricity and can be used to manipulate and transfer micro- and nano-structures. The nanotube bundles used for tweezers are about 50 nm in diameter and 2 μm in lengths. Under electric bias, two close sets of bundles are attracted and can be used as nanoscale tweezers.

Other uses of the same principle are named tweezers; although such terms are not necessarily widely used their meaning is clear to people in the relevant field. E.g., Raman tweezers, which combine Raman spectroscopy with optical tweezers.

<text>Berryteuthis magister, also known as the magister armhook squid, commander squid or schoolmaster gonate squid, is a medium-sized squid in the family Gonatidae. It is found in cold, high latitude waters of the North Pacific where it is among the most numerous squid species recorded.

There are three recognised subspecies of &quot;B. magister&quot;. The type locality of all three is Japan, although specimens have been recorded as far east as the Aleutian Islands.

== Description ==

The cylindrical bodies of magister armhook squid are muscular with very soft reddish brown skin. Like all gonatids, the suckers of their arms are arranged in four rows or &quot;series&quot;. But unlike other gonatids it is in females only that the suckers are modified into hooks; these hooks are on the mesial rows of the dorsal arms only. The clubs at the end of both tentacles are covered in 20 rows of suckers; these are smaller in &quot;B. magister nipponensis&quot;.

The wing-like fins at the rear of the body are rather large and may reach up to 50 percent of the mantle length. The fins are also smaller in &quot;B. magister nipponensis&quot;.

&quot;B. magister magister&quot; is known to reach a mantle length of ; total body length may exceed . Both &quot;B. magister nipponensis&quot; and &quot;B. magister shevtsovi&quot; are somewhat smaller, with a maximum mantle length of . Females are slightly larger than males.


== Habitat and behaviour ==

These squid are pelagic, roaming as deep as 1,000 metres and are associated with the continental shelf. Like other species in their family, Magister Armhook Squids are thought to undertake diel migration; by day the squid remain in the blackness of the depths. By night, they ascend to the upper layers of the water column to feed by starlight. An internal balancing organ called a &quot;statocyst&quot; ensures graceful movement.

Magister armhook squid prey upon both benthic and pelagic species; sculpins, smaller fish such as Sablefish and juvenile pollock, crustaceans including euphausiids and amphipods, and other squid. Cannibalism is also known to occur among the Magisters.

Baird&#x27;s beaked whale, the short-finned pilot whale, false killer whale, Dall&#x27;s porpoise and sperm whales are all known to feed upon magister armhook squid. Other predators include seabirds, northern fur seals, grenadiers, halibut and several species of salmon.

<text>Daan District (or Da-an District, Da&#x27;an District) is an important political, educational, commercial, residential and cultural district of Taipei, Taiwan. The name of the district means &quot;great safety&quot; or &quot;great peace&quot;. Located in Northern Taiwan, it is known for having one of the highest real estate prices in Taipei and Asia in general. 

== History ==
The district is named after Daiwan village () that was once located near the intersection of present-day Xinyi Road and Fuxing S. Road. The name was changed in the 1800s (during the Qing era) to the more auspicious but similar-sounding &quot;Daan&quot; (; ).

In 1875, the setup of Taipeh Prefecture put the village together with and &quot;La̍k-tiuⁿ-lê&quot; (), all of which are within today&#x27;s Daan District. During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, Daan village was merged with , , and . 

In 1945, after World War II, after the island of Taiwan was ceded to the Republic of China and under the current rule by the Chinese Nationalists, the boundaries of Daan District were delineated around Daan village, from which it derived its name. Subsequent notable alterations occurred during the 1990s, shaping the district&#x27;s configuration further.

== Geography ==
Daan is bounded on the east by Guangfu South Road, Keelung Road and Heping East Road; on the south by Neipu, Fuzhou and Toad Hills, and the Xinhai and Zhuangjing Tunnels; in the west by Roosevelt Road, Hangzhou South Road, Xinyi Road and Xinsheng South Road; and in the north by Civic Boulevard. The district is bordered by Xinyi District to the east, Wenshan District to the south, Zhongzheng District to the west, Zhongshan District to the northwest, and Songshan District to the northeast.

==Government institutions==
* Industrial Development Bureau
* Maritime and Port Bureau
* Ministry of Science and Technology
* Securities and Futures Bureau
* Small and Medium Enterprise Administration
* Taiwan Intellectual Property Office
* Transitional Justice Commission
== Education ==
Daan hosts three major national universities, contributing significantly to the educational landscape of the area. These universities serve as important centers for academic excellence, research, and intellectual development within the community: National Taiwan University (NTU), National Taiwan University of Science and Technology and National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU). The former two universities have strong engineering programs, NTNU has excellent research in the humanities and social sciences, and NTU also has a highly regarded medical school located in the Zhongzheng District.

The National Taipei University of Technology, National Taipei University of Education and Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University are also in this district.

For learners of Chinese as a foreign language, Daan hosts a number of popular language centers including the Taiwan Mandarin Institute (TMI), NTU&#x27;s International Chinese Language Program and NTNU&#x27;s Mandarin Training Center.

== Shopping ==
Daan has numerous shopping areas. The district boasts a selection of upscale boutiques, designer stores, and luxury retailers. On Zhongxiao East Road, Dunhua South Road and neighboring alleys, there are clothing shops, restaurants serving world cuisines, and major department stores including three branches of the Pacific Sogo Department Store, Breeze Center, and the Ming Yao Department Store, as well as the original 24-hour Dunnan branch of the Eslite Bookstore prior to its closure in 2020. The East Metro Market runs underneath Zhongxiao Road between metro stations. Specialty markets include the Jianguo Holiday Flower Market, the Jianguo Holiday Jade Market, and the Guanghua Computer and Electronics Market.

Daan&#x27;s most famous night markets are the Tonghua Night Market, in the east of the district, and the Shida Night Market in the west, near NTNU. Because of its proximity to NTNU and NTU, the Shida Night Market area is known as a student hangout and is filled with foreign restaurants and student-oriented bars. Yongkang Street, another popular restaurant area and home to the original Din Tai Fung restaurant, lies to the north of NTNU. Located near NTU is also the Wistaria Tea House, a quiet historic teahouse serving tea in the Gongfu style.

== Residential ==
Daan is renowned for hosting some of the most coveted residential real estate in Asia, featuring properties that command premium prices clustered around the tree-lined Dunhua South Road, Anhe Road and Ren&#x27;ai Road areas (known as the East District). As of 2009, Guangfu Road had the highest residential land value. In this area there are upscale fashion boutiques, elite retail shops and many of Taipei&#x27;s renowned &quot;lounge bars&quot;. A study conducted in 2020 by the Department of Land Administration found that among the 12 administrative districts in Taipei City, Daan District came out on top with an average price of NT$38.21 million per apartment, or approximately $1.2 million US dollars.

== Other places of interest ==
Other notable places include the Daan Forest Park, which was built on land formerly occupied by military officers and their families, and the Taipei Municipal Library. The park occupies an area of 26 hectares and includes an amphitheater, concrete roller- and inline-skating rink, ponds, pavilions, paths, and two underground parking lots. The park also has a popular playground for children. Daan Forest Park was intended to play a similar role as other major city parks such as New York City&#x27;s Central Park and London&#x27;s Hyde Park, acting as the &quot;lungs of Taipei city&quot; and as respite for residents from the bustle of life in Taipei. Similar to the large parks of other cities, Daan Park is surrounded by high price luxury condominiums that fetch a premium due to their desirable views, some reaching the price of $400 million New Taiwan dollars (approximately $14 million US dollars) in 2012.

The Mongolian and Tibetan Cultural Center, Workshop of Advanced Academy of Agronomy and Forestry, Jut Art Museum, Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab, Taipei Hakka Culture Hall, Wistaria Tea House, Mind Set Art Center, Nanmen Market, Wang Yun-wu Memorial Hall, and Fanglan Mansion, and many other tourist attractions are also located in Daan District. Museums in Daan District are Museum of Archives, Museum of National Taipei University of Education and Museum of Zoology.

== Transportation ==
Daan is served by the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit, otherwise known as the Taipei Metro. The Wenhu line, Bannan line, Songshan-Xindian line, Tamsui-Xinyi line, and Zhonghe-Xinlu line all have stations in the district. 

A total of fourteen stations are located in the district: Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, Zhongxiao Dunhua, Zhongxiao Fuxing, Zhongxiao Xinsheng, Daan Park, Daan, Xinyi Anhe, Technology Building, Liuzhangli, Linguang, Dongmen, Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Guting, Taipower Building and Gongguan.

There are several trailheads along this section of the road, notably the Colorado River Trailhead, which is the western terminus of the road segment closed during the winter.

The road crosses the Continental Divide at Milner Pass (elev. ) and reaches a maximum elevation of , near Fall River Pass (elev. ). Near the highest point on the road is another pass, Iceberg Pass (elev. ).

According to construction contracts and park maintenance files, the east end of the road is located at the Fall River entrance, however some guides list Deer Ridge Junction as the east end.

Trail Ridge is a high, flat spur range extending east from the main range of the Rockies between Fall River in the North and the Big Thompson River in the South. The road follows Trail Ridge from the Fall River Pass near Alpine Visitor Center to the Deer Ridge Junction.

==History==
Trail Ridge had been used by Native Americans to cross the mountains between their home lands in the west and hunting areas on the east side. Arapahoe Indians called the trail located on the ridge as &quot;taienbaa&quot; (&quot;Where the Children Walked&quot;) because it was so steep that children could not be carried, but had to walk. The Ute tribe crossing the mountains at Forest Canyon Pass marked their route with stone cairns. The present park Ute Trail follows partially that ancient route.

On the west side, about 1880, a wagon road was constructed along the Kawuneeche Valley from the town of Grand Lake to the mining camps of Lulu City and Gaskill. The camps were abandoned after a few years when short-lived mining boom ended and later the road was used only occasionally by hunters and tourists.

Fall River Road was the first road into the park&#x27;s high country. It opened in 1921 and quickly proved inadequate for motor travel as a single-track road with steep grades (up to 16%), tight curves and a short annual season due to snowpack. Construction began in 1929 and was complete to Fall River Pass by July 1932, with a maximum grade of 7%. The road was complete through the Kawuneeche Valley to Grand Lake in 1938. The route followed what was known to local Arapaho Indians as the Dog Trail. Internal opposition to the construction of a road through the park&#x27;s alpine tundra was overruled by National Park Service director Horace Albright, who wished to encourage park visitation. The road was designed to intrude as little as possible into the landscape, in accordance with Park Service design principles.

Hidden Valley (or Ski Estes Park) was a local ski area attraction from 1955 – 1991, off of Trail Ridge Road, now defunct.

<doc id="645602" wikidata="Q913849" url="?curid=645602" title="Minimax theorem">
<text>In the mathematical area of game theory and of convex optimization, a minimax theorem is a theorem that claims that
: formula_1
under certain conditions on the sets formula_2 and formula_3 and on the function formula_4. It is always true that the left-hand side is at most the right-hand side (max–min inequality) but equality only holds under certain conditions identified by minimax theorems. The first theorem in this sense is von Neumann&#x27;s minimax theorem about two-player zero-sum games published in 1928, which is considered the starting point of game theory. Von Neumann is quoted as saying &quot;As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games ... without that theorem ... I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved&quot;. Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann&#x27;s original theorem have appeared in the literature.

== Bilinear functions and zero-sum games ==
Von Neumann&#x27;s original theorem was motivated by game theory and applies to the case where 

* formula_2 and formula_3 are standard simplexes: formula_7 and formula_8, and
* formula_9 is a linear function in both of its arguments (that is, formula_4 is bilinear) and therefore can be written formula_11 for a finite matrix formula_12, or equivalently as formula_13.

Under these assumptions, von Neumann proved that
: formula_14
In the context of two-player zero-sum games, the sets formula_2 and formula_3 correspond to the strategy sets of the first and second player, respectively, which consist of lotteries over their actions (so-called mixed strategies), and their payoffs are defined by the payoff matrix formula_17. The function formula_9 encodes the expected value of the payoff to the first player when the first player plays the strategy formula_19 and the second player plays the strategy formula_20.

== Concave-convex functions ==

Von Neumann&#x27;s minimax theorem can be generalized to domains that are compact and convex, and to functions that are concave in their first argument and convex in their second argument (known as concave-convex functions). Formally, let formula_21 and formula_22 be compact convex sets. If formula_23 is a continuous function that is concave-convex, i.e.

: formula_24 is concave for every fixed formula_25, and
: formula_26 is convex for every fixed formula_27.

Then we have that

: formula_28

== Sion&#x27;s minimax theorem ==

Sion&#x27;s minimax theorem is a generalization of von Neumann&#x27;s minimax theorem due to Maurice Sion, relaxing the requirement that It states:

Let formula_2 be a convex subset of a linear topological space and let formula_3 be a compact convex subset of a linear topological space. If formula_4 is a real-valued function on formula_32 with

: formula_33 upper semicontinuous and quasi-concave on formula_2, for every fixed formula_35, and
: formula_36 lower semicontinuous and quasi-convex on formula_3, for every fixed formula_38.

Then we have that

: formula_39

<doc id="645605" wikidata="Q5126944" url="?curid=645605" title="Clarice Vance">
<text>Clarice Vance &quot;née&quot; Clara Etta Black (March 14, 1870 – August 24, 1961), &quot;The Southern Singer&quot; was an American vaudeville personality from the late 19th century to about 1917.

==Early life and marriage==

Clarice Vance was born in Ohio in 1870. She began her career in farce comedy in the early 1890s and was such a hit singing the songs interpolated into plot that she quickly won fame, singing ragtime and dialect songs as a single. When she performed with the James and Bonnie Thornton troop, he coined her, &quot;The Southern Singer&quot;.

She married &quot;Mose&quot; Gumble, head of Remick Music Publishing in New York, in 1904, but divorced him in 1914. Gumble was a well known songwriter along with his brother, Albert, but is remembered today as the man who gave George Gershwin his first job plugging songs at Remick. According to the 1900 census, this well known marriage was preceded by a marriage to William A. Sims who served briefly as her manager. According to the &quot;New York Clipper&quot; she was granted a divorce from John Blanchard in early 1904. This was followed by her marriage to Gumble.

Recent research into Pike County, Ohio census records indicate that Clarice&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name was Mary Vance, solving the riddle of her stage name. Her middle name was actually &quot;Etta&quot; not Ella. This was confirmed by Sterling Morris after obtaining a copy of the original notice in &quot;Variety&quot; of her marriage to Gumble in 1904. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ archives reveal that Vance later married Phelps Decker, a screen scenario writer and for a short time, manager in the New York offices of Universal Pictures. His services were terminated in early 1928 and discovered by his wife, &quot;former vaudeville actress Clarice Vance&quot; to have asphyxiated himself on February 5, 1928, in their apartment at 35 East 15th St. Manhattan, New York. He was 16 years her junior.

==Career==
Vance was known as a &quot;coon singer&quot;, singing popular Negro dialect songs of the day. She was a handsome woman, slightly over 6&#x27; tall and could project over a 26-piece orchestra when she sang on the stage. She shared the bill with the leading headliners of the day and her impish face appears on dozens of sheet music covers from 1897 to 1914. Her picture appeared in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; at one point. In 1910 she starred in a short-lived but lavish Broadway musical, &quot;A Skylark&quot;. She played at least three extended engagements in London, the most successful being a 26-week appearance at the London Palace in 1909.

Her records exhibit a rare, radiant and very droll wit. She recorded for Edison Records in 1905 (two selections) and from 1906 to 1909 for Victor. Her most popular song was &quot;Mariar&quot;, co-written by her husband; she recorded three versions of it.

==Later life==
Vance&#x27;s life after 1923 is shrouded in mystery. In the early 1920s, she appeared briefly in movies in character parts and slid into total oblivion, but according to the 1935 California voters registration, she was living in San Francisco, listing her profession as &quot;dramatic coach&quot; and residing at 1045 Bush Street.

From 1944 to 1951, she lived in a rooming house at 1535 Pine Street in San Francisco. From 1951 until her death in 1961, she was a patient at Napa State Mental Hospital in Napa, California. She died at this facility, aged 91, knowing only her name and that she was &quot;an actress&quot;.

<text>The Kiskiminetas River (commonly referred to as the Kiski by locals) is a tributary of the Allegheny River, approximately long, in Western Pennsylvania in the United States. The region stretching from the northern side of Harmar Township, Pennsylvania to the Kiskiminetas towns is often referred to by the locals as the Alle-Kiski Valley after the rivers.

== Course ==
The Kiskiminetas River is formed at Saltsburg, on the border between Westmoreland and Indiana counties, by the confluence of the Conemaugh River and Loyalhanna Creek. It flows northwest in a meandering course past Avonmore, Apollo, Vandergrift, Hyde Park and Leechburg. It joins the Allegheny River near Freeport at Schenley, approximately northeast of Pittsburgh.

The Kiski-Conemaugh watershed includes much of the historic coal-producing region of Western Pennsylvania. The water quality is considered degraded by numerous abandoned mine drainages in its upper reaches and tributaries, leading to on-going efforts by federal, state, and private agencies to improve the water quality of the river. The Kittanning Path, a major trail in the region used by Native Americans and early European settlers, crossed the river at a ford near present-day Leechburg.

===Political subdivisions===
The course of the Kiskiminetas River traverses the following political subdivisions, named in order of encounter traveling downstream.

*Saltsburg
*Loyalhanna Township, Westmoreland County
*Conemaugh Township, Indiana County
*Kiskiminetas Township, Armstrong County
*Bell Township, Westmoreland County
*Apollo
*Allegheny Township, Westmoreland County
*East Vandergrift

===Blacklegs Creek===
== Etymology ==

There is no definite interpretation of the origin of the name. It may come from a Native American phrase &quot;Kithanne&quot;, meaning &quot;Place of the largest stream.&quot; According to regional historians in the area, the name has historically had several other possible meanings, including: &quot;river of the big fish&quot; and &quot;plenty of walnuts.&quot; Robert Walker Smith in his &quot;History of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania&quot; (Chicago: Waterman, Watkins &amp; Co., 1883) reported that John Heckewelder (a Moravian writer, explorer, and historian who wrote about the Lenape and other tribes in Western Pennsylvania in the 18th century) claimed that the name is &quot;corrupted from Gieschgumanito, signifying, make daylight. In this case, the etymology is: Gisch-gu---day; gisch-que---today; gieschapen---it is daybreak; manitoon---to make. It was probably the word of command, given by a warrior to his comrades at night to break up camp and resume the journey, or war-path.&quot; Smith also described another possible meaning from another source: &quot;It is said in McCullough&#x27;s Narrative, that the Indians called this river Kee-ak-ksheman-nit-toos, signifying &#x27;cut spirit&#x27;.&quot; Smith noted that he preferred Heckewelder&#x27;s definition. It is also possible that &quot;Kiskiminetas&quot; means &quot;clear, clean stream of many bends.&quot;

<doc id="645624" wikidata="Q30019" url="?curid=645624" title="Sphagnum">
<text>Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as sphagnum moss, also bog moss and quacker moss (although that term is also sometimes used for peat). Accumulations of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions.

As &quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. Thus, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; can influence the composition of such habitats, with some describing &quot;Sphagnum&quot; as &#x27;habitat manipulators&#x27; or &#x27;autogenic ecosystem engineers&#x27;. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants.

&quot;Sphagnum&quot; and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss&#x27;s cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions.

Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, and any one peatland may have a number of different &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species.

==Description==
An individual &quot;Sphagnum&quot; plant consists of a main stem, with tightly arranged clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting of two or three spreading branches and two to four hanging branches. The top of the plant (capitulum) has compact clusters of young branches that give the plant its characteristic tuft-like appearance. Along the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes, named stem leaves; the shape varies according to species.
&quot;Sphagnum&quot; has a distinctive cellular structure. The stem portion consists of two important sections. The pith which is the site of food production and storage, and the cortical layer which serves to absorb water and protect the pith. Mosses have no vascular system to move water and nutrients around the plant. Thus tissues are thin and usually one cell thick to allow them to diffuse easily. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses have two distinct cell types. There are small, green, living cells with chlorophyll (chlorophyllose cells) that produce food for the plant. Additionally there are larger hyaline or retort cells that are barrel shaped and have a pore at one end to allow for water absorption and improved water-holding capacity. These unique cells help &quot;Sphagnum&quot; to retain water during prolonged UV exposure.

=== Lifecycle ===
&quot;Sphagnum&quot;, like all other land plants, has an alternation of generations; like other bryophytes, the haploid gametophyte generation is dominant and persistent. Unlike other mosses, the long-lived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake.

&quot;Sphagnum&quot; species can be unisexual (male or female, dioecious) or bisexual (male and female gametes produced from the same plant; monoecious); In North America, 80% of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species are unisexual.

Gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation, producing much of the living material in sphagnum peatlands.

Swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female gametophyte. The sporophyte is relatively short-lived, and consists almost entirely of a shiny green, spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores. Sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal, but unlike other mosses, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; stalks are produced by the maternal gametophyte. Tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the sporophyte by meiosis, which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap, called an operculum, and shoots the spores some distance. The spores germinate to produce minute protonemae, which start as filaments, can become thalloid, and can produce a few rhizoids. Soon afterwards, the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic, erect, leafy, branched gametophyte with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells. 

Carpets of living &quot;Sphagnum&quot; may be attacked by various fungi, and one fungus that is also a mushroom, &quot;Sphagnurus paluster&quot;, produces conspicuous dead patches. When this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; is induced to produce nonphotosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes.

=== Spore dispersal ===
As with many other mosses, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species disperse spores through the wind. The tops of spore capsules are only about 1 cm (&quot;) above ground, and where wind is weak. As the spherical spore capsule dries, the operculum is forced off, followed by a cloud of spores. The exact mechanism has traditionally attributed to a &quot;pop gun&quot; method using air compressed in the capsule, reaching a maximum velocity of per second, but alternative mechanisms have been recently proposed. High-speed photography has shown vortex rings are created during the discharge, which enable the spores to reach a height of , further than would be expected by ballistics alone. The acceleration of the spores is about 36,000g. Spores are extremely important in establishment of new populations in disturbed habitats and on islands.

Human activities like slash-and-burn and cattle grazing are believed to promote the growth and expansion of Sphagnum moss. Oceanic islands such as the Faroe Islands, the Galápagos or the Azores have recorded a significant increase in their Sphagnum populations after human settlement.

==Taxonomy==

Peat moss can be distinguished from other moss species by its unique branch clusters. The plant and stem color, the shape of the branch and stem leaves, and the shape of the green cells are all characteristics used to identify peat moss to species. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; taxonomy has been very contentious since the early 1900s; most species require microscopic dissection to be identified. In the field, most &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species can be identified to one of four major sections of the genus—classification and descriptions follow Andrus 2007 (Flora North America):
*&quot;Sphagnum&quot; sect. &quot;Acutifolia&quot; plants generally form hummocks above the water line, usually colored orange or red. Examples: &quot;Sphagnum fuscum&quot; and &quot;S. warnstorfii&quot;.
*&quot;Sphagnum&quot; sect. &quot;Cuspidata&quot; plants are usually found in hollows, lawns, or are aquatic, and are green. Examples: &quot;Sphagnum cuspidatum&quot; and &quot;S. flexuosum&quot;.
*&quot;Sphagnum&quot; sect. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; plants have the largest gametophytes among the sections, forming large hummocks, their leaves form cuculate (hood-shaped) apices, and are green, except for &quot;S. magellanicum&quot; Example: &quot;Sphagnum austinii&quot;.
*&quot;Sphagnum&quot; sect. &quot;Subsecunda&quot; plants vary in color from green to yellow and orange (but never red), and are found in hollows, lawns, or are aquatic. Species always with unisexual gametophytes. Examples: &quot;Sphagnum lescurii&quot; and &quot;Sphagnum pylaesii&quot;.

The reciprocal monophyly of these sections and two other minor ones (&quot;Rigida&quot; and &quot;Squarrosa&quot;) has been clarified using molecular phylogenetics. All but two species normally identified as &quot;Sphagnum&quot; reside in one clade; two other species have recently been separated into new families within the Sphagnales reflecting an ancestral relationship with the Tasmanian endemic &quot;Ambuchanania&quot; and long phylogenetic distance to the rest of &quot;Sphagnum&quot;. Within main clade of &quot;Sphagnum&quot;, phylogenetic distance is relatively short, and molecular dating methods suggest nearly all current &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species are descended from a radiation that occurred just 14 million years ago.

==Distribution==
&quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses occur mainly in the Northern Hemisphere in peat bogs, conifer forests, and moist tundra areas. Their northernmost populations lie in the archipelago of Svalbard, Arctic Norway, at 81° N.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the largest peat areas are in southern Chile and Argentina, part of the vast Magellanic moorland (&quot;circa&quot; 44,000 square km; 17,000 sq. mi.). Peat areas are also found in New Zealand and Tasmania. In the Southern Hemisphere, however, peat landscapes may contain many moss species other than &quot;Sphagnum&quot;. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species are also reported from &quot;dripping rocks&quot; in mountainous, subtropical Brazil.

== Conservation ==
Several of the world&#x27;s largest wetlands are sphagnum-dominated bogs, including the West Siberian Lowland, the Hudson Bay Lowland and the Mackenzie River Valley. These areas provide habitat for common and rare species. They also store large amounts of carbon, which helps reduce global warming.

According to an article written in 2013, the U.S. got up to 80% of sphagnum peat moss it uses from Canada. At that time, in Canada, the peat bog mass harvested each year was roughly 1/60th of the peat mass that annually accumulated. About 0.02% of the of Canadian peat bog are used for peat moss mining. Some efforts are being made to restore peat bogs after peat mining, and some debate exists as to whether the peat bogs can be restored to their premining condition and how long the process takes. &quot;The North American Wetlands Conservation Council estimates that harvested peatlands can be restored to &#x27;ecologically balanced systems&#x27; within five to 20 years after peat harvesting.&quot; Some wetlands scientists assert that &quot;a managed bog bears little resemblance to a natural one. Like tree farms, these peatlands tend toward monoculture, lacking the biodiversity of an unharvested bog.&quot;

PittMoss, a peat moss alternative made from recycled newspaper, has emerged as a sustainable substitute in growing media. Coir has also been touted as a sustainable alternative to peat moss in growing media. Another peat moss alternative is manufactured in California from sustainably harvested redwood fiber. Semi-open cell polyurethane materials available in flaked and sheet stock are also finding application as sphagnum replacements with typical usage in green wall and roof garden substrates.

===Chile===
In the 2010s, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; peat in Chile has begun to be harvested at a large scale for export to countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. &quot;Sphagnum&quot;’s ability to absorb excess water and release it during dry months means that overexploitation may threaten the water supply in the fjords and channels of Chile. Extraction of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; in Chile is regulated by law since 2 August 2018. Between 2018 and 2024, Chilean law allowed for the manual extraction of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; using only pitchforks or similar tools as an aid. In a given designated harvesting area (polygon) at least 30% of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; coverage had to be left unharvested. Harvested &quot;Sphagnum&quot; fibers we not allowed to exceed in length and the remaining &quot;Sphagnum&quot; after harvest was not to be left with a length of less than over the water table. In the regions of Los Ríos (40°S) and Los Lagos (41–43°S) the same plots could be harvested after 12 years, while further south in Aysén (44–48°S) and Magallanes (49–56°S) 85 years had to pass before the same area can be harvested again. According to a 2024 law harvesting of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; can only be done with land-management plans approved by Servicio Agrícola y Ganadero. Some environmental organisations expressed regret as the original law project presented in 2018 sought the extablish a definitive ban on the harvest. Along Rubens River in Magallanes Region there are some historically important harvesting fields of peat in &quot;Sphagnum&quot; peatlands. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; peatlands in Chile disturbed by peat extraction have been found to host various invasive plant species including &quot;Rumex acetosella&quot;, &quot;Carex canescens&quot;, &quot;Holcus lanatus&quot; and &quot;Hieracium pilosella&quot;. Harvesting of peat in &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses or any where else is forbidden in Chile since April 2024.

Harvesting aside, bogs where &quot;Sphagnum&quot; grows have also come under threat by the development of wind farms in cool humid areas such as the Cordillera del Piuchén where the San Pedro Wind Farm was constructed in the 2010s. The construction of each wind turbine usually implies the removal of vegetation and the alteration of the soil, changing by the way also of the local hydrology.

===Europe===
Europe has a long history of the exploitation of peatlands. The Netherlands, for example, once had large areas of peatland, both fen and bog. Between 100 AD and the present, they were drained and converted to agricultural land. The English broadlands have small lakes that originated as peat mines.
More than 90% of the bogs in England have been damaged or destroyed. A handful of bogs has been preserved through government buyouts of peat-mining interests. Over longer time scales, however, some parts of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have seen expansion of bogs, particularly blanket bogs, in response to deforestation and abandonment of agricultural land.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has, like other parts of the world, lost large areas of peatland. The latest estimates for wetland loss in New Zealand are 90% over 150 years. In some cases, better care is taken during the harvesting of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; to ensure enough moss is remaining to allow regrowth. An 8-year cycle is suggested, but some sites require a longer cycle of 11 to 32 years for full recovery of biomass, depending on factors including whether reseeding is done, the light intensity, and the water table. This &quot;farming&quot; is based on a sustainable management program approved by New Zealand&#x27;s Department of Conservation; it ensures the regeneration of the moss, while protecting the wildlife and the environment. Most harvesting in New Zealand swamps is done only using pitchforks without the use of heavy machinery. During transportation, helicopters are commonly employed to transfer the newly harvested moss from the swamp to the nearest road.

==Uses==

Decayed, dried sphagnum moss has the name of peat or peat moss. This is used as a soil conditioner which increases the soil&#x27;s capacity to hold water and nutrients by increasing capillary forces and cation exchange capacity – uses that are particularly useful in gardening. This is often desired when dealing with very sandy soil, or plants that need increased or steady moisture content to flourish. A distinction is sometimes made between sphagnum moss, the live moss growing on top of a peat bog, and &#x27;sphagnum peat moss&#x27; (North American usage) or &#x27;sphagnum peat&#x27; (British usage), the latter being the slowly decaying matter underneath.

Dried sphagnum moss is used in northern Arctic regions as an insulating material.

Anaerobic acidic sphagnum bogs have low rates of decay, and hence preserve plant fragments and pollen to allow reconstruction of past environments. They even preserve human bodies for millennia; examples of these preserved specimens are Tollund Man, Haraldskær Woman, Clonycavan Man and Lindow Man. Such bogs can also preserve human hair and clothing, one of the most noteworthy examples being Egtved Girl, Denmark. Because of the acidity of peat, however, bones are dissolved rather than preserved. These bogs have also been used to preserve food. Up to 2000-year-old containers of butter or lard have been found.
&quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss has been used for centuries as a dressing for wounds, including through World War I. Botanist John William Hotson&#x27;s paper, &quot;Sphagnum as a surgical dressing&quot;, published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1918, was instrumental in the acceptance of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss use as a medical dressing in place of cotton. Preparations using &quot;Sphagnum&quot; such as Sphagnol soap have been used for various skin conditions including acne, ringworm, and eczema. The soap was used by the British Red Cross during both World Wars to treat facial wounds and trench sores.

Since it is absorptive and extremely acidic, it inhibits growth of bacteria and fungi, so it is used for shipping seeds and live plants.

Peat moss is used to dispose of the clarified liquid output (effluent) from septic tanks in areas that lack the proper conditions for ordinary disposal means. It is also used as an environmentally friendly alternative to chlorine in swimming pool sanitation. The moss inhibits the growth of microbes and reduces the need for chlorine in swimming pools.

In Finland, peat mosses have been used to make bread during famines.

In China, Japan and Korea, long strand dried sphagnum moss is traditionally used as a potting medium for cultivating Vanda falcata orchids.

<doc id="645628" wikidata="Q219248" url="?curid=645628" title="Marc Overmars">
<text>Marc Overmars (; born 29 March 1973) is a Dutch former professional footballer and former director of football at Belgian Pro League side Royal Antwerp F.C. He was previously director of football at Ajax. During his football career, he played as a winger and was renowned for his speed and technical skills.

Overmars was born in Emst and was passionate about football from an early age. He began his playing career at SV Epe before joining Go Ahead Eagles&#x27; youth team in 1987. He secured a place in the first team by the 1990–91 season, but joined Willem II in time for the following season. His stay at the club was short; after 31 appearances he signed for Ajax in 1992. He established himself as an important member of the team that won three Eredivisie titles from 1994 and 1996 and the UEFA Champions League in 1995. In December 1995, Overmars sustained a cruciate ligament injury which ruled him out of playing for eight months.

In 1997, he joined Arsenal; his performances at the club were indifferent to begin with and attracted criticism from football pundits and fans. By the end of his first season, Overmars became a focal point of Arsenal&#x27;s league and cup double success. He scored the winning goal against league rivals Manchester United which set his team on their way to securing the Premier League title and opened the scoring against Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup final. In 2000, he moved to Barcelona in a deal worth £25 million and became the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The club failed to win silverware during his stay and numerous managerial changes made him a peripheral player. A persistent knee injury prompted Overmars to announce his retirement in 2004, but he reversed his decision in 2008 and went on to play one season for Go Ahead Eagles before retiring again.

In 2012, Overmars was named as Ajax&#x27;s director of football. In February 2022, he left the role after a &quot;series of inappropriate messages to several female colleagues&quot;, according to a formal statement by the club. Among other things, he had sent photos of his genitals to at least one employee. In March 2022, he was presented as director of football by Royal Antwerp F.C., causing the withdrawal of four sponsors of the club the same week.

Overmars represented the Netherlands national team for 11 years. He scored on his international debut in 1993 against Turkey, and was a member of the Dutch squad for four major tournaments: the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, and 2000 and 2004 European Championships.

== Early life ==
Overmars was born in Emst, Gelderland, growing up on a family farm with his parents and assisting his grandfather with the potato harvest each year. There were no machines or tractors, so when the time came to extract the potatoes, his family tied a rope around Overmars&#x27; waist, connected it to a cart and made him run while they pulled the crop out.

His father Ben described him as a &quot;clumsy&quot; child, whose main interest was playing football: &quot;He used to come down 24 stairs to breakfast bouncing a ball on his head.&quot; This had an effect on his schoolwork; Overmars was uninterested in school, but did pass &quot;a couple of GCEs&quot;. Ben did not know whether he made the effort to take his exams just to please him. As a teenager, Overmars did weight-training which improved his speed. He also attributed his pace to his mother who was quick, but &quot;had no time for sports&quot;.

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
Overmars began his playing career at local club SV Epe. In 1987, he joined Go Ahead Eagles at the age of 14. After making his breakthrough into the first team, he joined Willem II for ƒ500,000.

=== Ajax ===
After one season at Willem II, Overmars signed for Ajax in July 1992. Both clubs settled on a transfer fee of ƒ2.5 million, after Ajax&#x27;s initial bid of ƒ1.5 million was rejected. Manager Louis van Gaal was very fond of Overmars beforehand and described him as a &quot;multi-functional player&quot;. Overmars&#x27; debut came in a 3–0 win against Dordrecht on 16 August 1992. His first goal for Ajax was away to RKC Waalwijk in October and he scored a further seven goals in the 1992–93 season. Several teams chose to combat Overmars&#x27; threat with heavy tackles; he detested this, adding, &quot;I do not fall on purpose, but if they keep kicking, I would sometimes give something back in return.&quot; Ajax finished the campaign third in the league; their form in the final few months was described as &quot;maddening&quot; by football writer David Winner, as they defeated eventual champions Feyenoord by five goals, but dropped points to &quot;minnows like MVV Maastricht&quot;. The team lost to Auxerre in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, but did not end the season trophyless – they beat Heerenveen 6–2 to win the KNVB Cup. Overmars scored two goals in the final.

Ajax began the 1993–94 season with a 4–0 defeat of Feyenoord to lift the Dutch Supercup; Overmars scored the team&#x27;s fourth goal. In August 1993, he was awarded the Dutch Golden Shoe, as voted for by Dutch journalists. Overmars was happy with how his career progressed and said it was a &quot;dream&quot; to play for Ajax. Although he featured in 42 matches – five fewer matches than in the previous season – his goal count was much improved: he scored 12 goals in total, all of which came in the Eredivisie. His goals helped Ajax win the league; the team ended the campaign 25 points clear of second place Feyenoord.

Overmars enjoyed further success in the 1994–95 season. Ajax retained the league and won the UEFA Champions League, beating Milan in the final. He scored against Bayern Munich at the semi-final stage of the latter competition. In later years, Overmars criticised the expansion of the Champions League to include non league champions: &quot;When I won it with Ajax it was only the teams who finished first who took part. It&#x27;s not special any more. I think the Champions&#x27; League is just a starter for what they want to do in the future, create a European League.&quot; Overmars&#x27;s exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England. He knew of Arsenal&#x27;s interest, but was puzzled as to why a move &quot;didn&#x27;t work out.&quot; In the summer of 1995 he was linked with a move to Manchester United, but said: &quot;No thanks I want to stay with Ajax for two more seasons.&quot;

In December 1995, Overmars injured himself during Ajax&#x27;s match against De Graafschap. Close examination showed the player had torn ligaments on his left knee, which was &quot;completely severed&quot;. He therefore missed the remainder of the 1995–96 season and advised Ajax to purchase a new striker to make up their loss. The club however signed left winger Peter Hoekstra in January 1996. Ajax played a second consecutive Champions League final in May 1996, but lost to Juventus by a penalty shoot-out. They did however retain the league for a third season.

The introduction of the Bosman ruling in 1995 had negative consequences for Ajax in the 1996–97 season. The club lost several players, and reinvested poorly according to Winner. Injuries also affected their challenge for honours; many players were exhausted as a result of UEFA Euro 1996 and the short summer break that came with it. Chairman Michael van Praag was determined to keep the club&#x27;s players and said that Overmars had signed a four-year contract in 1996. He added, &quot;We are not going to allow them to break their contracts so they are not leaving.&quot; On the pitch, Overmars made his return from injury against AZ on 28 August 1996. He had his least productive season for Ajax, scoring two goals. The club finished the season in fourth position.

=== Arsenal ===
Overmars signed for Arsenal in June 1997. The fee was reported to be between £5 million and £7 million, with the player on a five-year contract, paid £18,000 per week. Overmars relished the challenge of playing in England: &quot;I like English football because there is more pace. With my speed and quality I think it will be good for me here.&quot; Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his &quot;best years ahead of him&quot; and met his criteria of a player &quot;used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything that goes with it&quot;. He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – &quot;we were maybe the best away team,&quot; and commented on their inability to play expansive football. Wenger felt the signing of Overmars would rectify that problem.

Overmars made his competitive debut for Arsenal against Leeds United in a 1–1 draw on 9 August 1997. Two weeks later, he scored his first goal for the club, away to Southampton. Arsenal went to the top of the league table on goal difference in September 1997, after a 4–0 win against West Ham United. Overmars, who scored two goals in the match, had now &quot;run into devastating form&quot; according to Brian Glanville. His impact however waned in the subsequent months and so did Arsenal&#x27;s form; a 3–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers on 13 December 1997 meant the club dropped to fifth place. The turn of the year saw improvement to Overmars&#x27; game, which coincided with &quot;the more general rejuvenation of the whole team&quot;. He scored both of Arsenal&#x27;s goals in their win over Leeds United on 11 January 1998. Overmars up until this point was subject to criticism from commentators and fans. Wenger emphasised that this was his first year in England and there was more to come from him. He said Overmars was a &quot;positive buy&quot; and pointed out that his goalscoring record was &quot;not bad for a winger&quot;.

Arsenal caught up with league leaders Manchester United by the time both clubs played each other at Old Trafford in March 1998. Overmars was a constant threat in the match and scored in the 80th minute. He received the ball from Nicolas Anelka and ran with it, before managing to flick it beyond the goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel. Arsenal went on to win, which put them six points behind Manchester United, with three games in hand. Overmars afterwards said, &quot;This was a great result for us. But you don&#x27;t win the Premier League against Manchester United; you have to beat the other clubs.&quot; Arsenal overtook Manchester United in April 1998, and won the league after beating Everton on 3 May 1998; Overmars scored two goals in the match. The team later faced Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final and it was Overmars who scored the opening goal, in the 23rd minute. Anelka&#x27;s goal in the second half ensured victory and completed a league and cup double for Arsenal. Wenger praised Overmars after the final:

Overmars began the 1998–99 season for Arsenal in good form; scoring the opening goal in a 3–0 win against Manchester United, thus being named as the man of the match of the 1998 FA Charity Shield. He also found himself on the scoresheet at home to Nottingham Forest in the opening game of the league campaign. Arsenal participated in the Champions League, but their time in the competition was brief. The team did not make it past the group stage, and in the decisive game against Dynamo Kyiv which they lost, Overmars was ruled out with an abdominal injury. In February 1999, he scored a &quot;controversial&quot; winning goal against Sheffield United in the FA Cup fifth round. Nwankwo Kanu failed to return the ball to the opposition, in order to allow one of their players to receive treatment for an injury. Due to the controversial circumstances in which the game was won, Wenger immediately offered a replay. His proposal was accepted by The Football Association (FA) and Arsenal went on to win the replayed match 2–1, where the opening goal was scored by Overmars. Arsenal exited the competition in the semi-final stage against Manchester United, who went on to win the league.

In November 1999, Overmars scored his first hat-trick for Arsenal, at home to Middlesbrough. His performance was lauded by journalist Lynne Truss, who wrote in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Overmars was in top Jack Russell form, bounding after the ball and prepared to savage anybody who tried to take it away from him.&quot; He twisted his ankle in action for Arsenal against Sheffield Wednesday in January 2000 and was out of action for six weeks. Unlike the previous two seasons, Arsenal never did pose a serious threat to Manchester United, who went on to retain the league in 1999–2000. Overmars had suggested before the campaign that Arsenal were as strong as their rivals, &quot;especially in attack where we now have so many more options&quot;. Arsenal ended the league season strongly, winning eight games in a row between March and May to move from fifth to second place. In April 2000, Overmars scored the winning goal against Everton and was the standout performer in the game. His final game for Arsenal was the 2000 UEFA Cup Final against Galatasaray, which they lost 4–1 on penalties after a goalless draw.

In 2008, Overmars was voted as the 12th-greatest player in Arsenal&#x27;s history by the club&#x27;s supporters.

=== Barcelona ===
After the Netherlands&#x27; exit at Euro 2000, Lazio and Barcelona were reportedly interested in signing Overmars; the latter club hastened their efforts once Joan Gaspart was elected as president. Overmars was &quot;flattered&quot; by Barcelona&#x27;s interest and said moving to such a club would &quot;excite any player&quot;. Gaspart travelled to London to open negotiations with Arsenal and eventually reached an agreement to sign Overmars and his teammate Emmanuel Petit for a combined fee of around £32 million in July 2000. Overmars cost £25 million, making him the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The announcement of his transfer was unconventional; he publicised it on his personal website before informing the media. His site garnered 250,000 hits in one day, highlighting the internet&#x27;s &quot;potential for exponential growth&quot; in regards to football. Overmars was delighted with the move, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to pull on the famous shirt and play my first game.&quot;

Overmars made his debut for Barcelona against Arsenal in the Amsterdam Tournament in August 2000. He lasted 45 minutes and was substituted after sustaining an ankle injury. His first competitive start came at home to Málaga on 8 September 2000. His performance in the match started off well, then faded before coming back in the second half, opined Andrés Astruells in &quot;El Mundo Deportivo&quot;. He scored his first goal for the club at home to Racing de Santander on 23 September 2000; it involved him dribbling the ball around the goalkeeper. Barcelona made an indifferent start to the 2000–01 season and by February 2001, journalist Sid Lowe commented it looked improbable that Lorenzo Serra Ferrer would remain as manager of the club. Wenger was touted as his replacement after reportedly meeting with Gaspart. Overmars believed his former manager was going to leave Arsenal and revealed that, &quot;Barcelona have asked for lots of information about Wenger. I think something could happen soon.&quot; In La Liga, Overmars scored the team&#x27;s seventh goal in their 7–0 win against Athletic Bilbao in February 2001; his performance was rated four stars out of five by &quot;El Mundo Deportivo&quot;.

Barcelona exited the semi-final stage of the UEFA Cup to Liverpool in April 2001. Serra Ferrer was sacked a week later and replaced by Carles Rexach. As the season drew to a close, Overmars turned into an influential player for Barcelona. Lowe labelled him as &quot;Barça&#x27;s only decent player in recent weeks&quot; and was surprised he started on the bench against Real Valladolid in June 2001. When Overmars came on, he scored the equaliser to earn Barcelona a 2–2 draw. The team ended the campaign in fourth place after a dramatic 3–2 win against Valencia.

In the 2001–02 season, Barcelona once more finished fourth in the league. Petit left the club to join Chelsea before the season commenced, as he had found his first team opportunities limited. While on international duty with the Netherlands in September 2001, Overmars suffered a bruised knee and as a result did not play for Barcelona for a month. In November 2001, he scored Barcelona&#x27;s third goal against Liverpool in the Champions League, which came after 29 uninterrupted passes. It was described by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as &quot;arguably the greatest team goal ever scored&quot;. Compared to the previous season, Overmars was used more sparingly in matches. Rexach had changed the team&#x27;s formation to accommodate new signing Javier Saviola and promoted Xavi as a first-team regular. Overmars made an impact as a substitute against Galatasaray in December 2001; he set up Saviola twice to earn Barcelona a 2–2 draw. Mircea Lucescu, the manager of Galatasaray, complimented Overmars afterwards: &quot;When we were 2–0 up I told my players at half-time to maintain the result, but Overmars is a great player. We did not have a solution to him and it threw our game off balance.&quot;

Overmars was subject to transfer speculation in early 2002 because of his limited role in the first team, but he revealed he was happy to stay at Barcelona: &quot;My priority now is that the team wins. Personal issues are not important. I&#x27;m here for whatever you need me.&quot; In the Champions League, he started in the semi-final first leg against Real Madrid; the team lost 2–0 and were defeated 3–1 on aggregate. In May 2002, Rexach was dismissed and replaced by Louis van Gaal, who was managing the club for a second time. Overmars was wary of the appointment beforehand, saying, &quot;Van Gaal is a good manager, but I do not know if his return would be good for Barcelona.&quot; He underwent surgery on his right knee at the end of the season and was out of action for six months.

The 2002–03 season saw Barcelona make their worst ever start to a league season; the club was two points off a relegation spot after defeat to Sevilla in December 2002. Van Gaal departed the club in January 2003 and following a board meeting, Gaspart resigned as president a month later. Radomir Antić presided as manager for the remainder of the season. He encouraged the team to play with more width and made minimal changes; for instance, he switched Overmars from a left winger to a right one. Overmars tore a muscle in his thigh during a Copa del Rey match against Terrassa in May 2003 and was sidelined for a month. In his final season for Barcelona, the club appointed Frank Rijkaard as manager and elected Joan Laporta as president. The club finished second in La Liga and were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Celtic in the fourth round. Overmars made 29 appearances in the first team, three fewer than in the previous campaign. He was prolific in the Copa del Rey, a competition he scored twice in three matches. His performance against Ciudad de Murcia earned him recognition in &quot;El Mundo Deportivo&quot;, who wrote &quot;frequent injuries have prevented him from consolidating his [position] as indisputable&quot;. Due to a persistent knee injury, he announced his retirement from football in July 2004 and left Barcelona without compensation.

=== Go Ahead Eagles ===
In July 2008, Overmars played in Jaap Stam&#x27;s testimonial match in a team of &quot;former Stam-mates&quot; against Ajax. His performance, which saw him trouble defender George Ogăraru, earned him invitations from Dutch and German clubs to make his professional comeback. He declined the offers at first, but in August 2008 announced he was to come out of retirement to play again for Go Ahead Eagles. Overmars&#x27; comeback lasted only one season as his knee continued to give him discomfort.

== International career ==
Overmars&#x27; first call-up to the Netherlands senior national squad came in February 1993 for a 1994 World Cup qualifier against Turkey. He scored five minutes into his debut, after good play from Wim Jonk. The team went on to win 3–1 and Overmars said the goal was good for his confidence. Dick Advocaat, the manager of the Netherlands, was complimentary of the debutant&#x27;s performance. In April 1993, Overmars earned the national team a penalty against England after Des Walker fouled him. Peter van Vossen converted the spot kick to complete a comeback for the Netherlands, who had been 2–0 down after 24 minutes.

The national team qualified for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in November 1993. Advocaat selected Overmars for the tournament and he featured in all of the Netherlands&#x27; five matches. Against the Republic of Ireland in the round of 16, he took advantage of Terry Phelan&#x27;s header intended for goalkeeper Packie Bonner and sprinted away to set up Dennis Bergkamp to score. The Netherlands were eliminated in the quarter-finals against Brazil; Advocaat deployed Overmars as an extra attacker, but for much of the match he played as one of five in midfield. His corner in the 76th minute was met by Aron Winter and levelled the scores at 2–2 for a brief period – a goal from Branco resolved the match in favour of Brazil. Overmars&#x27; performances in the competition led him to be named the best young player of the 1994 World Cup.

In October 1995, he scored a hat-trick for the Netherlands in their Euro 1996 qualifier away to Malta. He was pleased with his performance – &quot;things are getting better,&quot; and felt he needed to practise his shooting and inward running technique. Overmars did not participate in the tournament finals as he was recuperating from his knee ligament injury. Sports writer Rob Hughes said the Netherlands draw against Scotland showed why &quot;they sorely miss the speed and balance of Marc Overmars&quot;. The player returned to international action for the 1998 World Cup qualifier against Wales in November 1996. He believed his best position for the national team was up front, but manager Guus Hiddink wanted him to remain as a winger.

Overmars was selected in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team&#x27;s 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.

Overmars suffered a minor setback prior to Euro 2000 with a sore thigh muscle. However, he resumed training and was declared fit for the Netherlands opening match against Czech Republic, where he started on the bench. His introduction brought about the only goal of the match – a penalty scored the 89th minute. Ronald de Boer was adjudged to have had his shirt pulled whilst jumping to meet Overmars&#x27; cross. In the quarter-finals, he scored twice in the team&#x27;s 6–1 win against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands went on to lose their semi-final to Italy on penalties. Overmars played in eight of the national team&#x27;s ten 2002 World Cup qualifiers, but it was an unsuccessful campaign as they failed to qualify for the finals.

After a year&#x27;s absence from international football due to injury, Overmars was recalled to the Netherlands squad for their friendly against Portugal in April 2003. Two months later, he came on as a substitute against Belarus in a Euro 2004 qualifier and scored the opening goal of the game. He was selected for the tournament held in Portugal, and was advised by Advocaat not to train more than once a day, so that his body would resist burn out. Overmars only started three matches in Euro 2004, his final game was the Netherlands loss to Portugal in the semi-final. In all, he played in 86 games for his national side, scoring 17 goals.

== Style of play ==
A diminutive footballer, Overmars in his prime was described as &quot;the archetypal winger&quot;, whose speed, vision, two-footedness and dribbling ability meant he was able to get the better of most defenders and either score or assist goals. Indeed, pace and acceleration was an important part of his game and reflective of his nicknames &quot;TGV&quot; and &quot;Roadrunner&quot;. Former teammate Emmanuel Petit said his strength lay &quot;... in pushing the ball beyond his marker and darting past him into space to deliver crosses&quot;. Former defender Gary Neville opined that Overmars was the best winger he came up against in his time at Manchester United, not least because of his versatility, which was exemplified by Overmars&#x27;s ability to play on both the left and the right wing, despite being naturally right footed.

Football pundit Alan Hansen believed Overmars benefited from a &quot;strange feature of the modern English game&quot; – defenders backing off and allowing him to run until he was in a shooting position. Despite his talent, Overmars was also known to be injury-prone throughout his career.

== Post-football career ==
In February 2005, Overmars became a shareholder of Go Ahead Eagles. Two months later, he joined the club&#x27;s supervisory board to deal with technical matters. Hans de Vroome, chairman of Go Ahead Eagles, said he was &quot;more than satisfied&quot; with Overmars&#x27; arrival, adding, &quot;The board needs someone with a solid football background.&quot;

In 2011, Overmars took up a position as youth coach of Ajax for one day per week. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Overmars left his post at Go Ahead Eagles. He said, &quot;I have been active on a voluntary basis at the club for seven years. That&#x27;s a big time in my life.&quot; The club&#x27;s disappointing league form &quot;accelerated&quot; his decision.

Overmars became director of football at Ajax in July 2012. He resigned from his position at Ajax on 6 February 2022 after admitting to sending a series of inappropriate messages to female colleagues. Among other things, he had sent photos of his genitals to at least one employee.

On 21 March 2022 he was presented as Director of Football by Royal Antwerp, causing the withdrawal of four sponsors of the club the same week.

On 10 January 2024 Overmars was banned for 1 year by FIFA from world football for his inappropriate behaviour.

&quot;An independent sports tribunal last year banned Overmars from any position in Dutch football for two years over the incidents, with one year suspended. The KNVB then asked Fifa to turn the domestic suspension into a global one. “We have a duty to report this sanction to Fifa’s disciplinary committee ... which has decided to take over the suspension as of 16 November 2023,” the KNVB said.&quot; 

== Personal life ==
Overmars married his long-term partner Chantal van Woensel in May 2013. Prior to the wedding, the couple had two sons, Frenkie and Nick, both of whom are footballers. He is a co-owner of a restaurant in Epe, in the province of Gelderland, where he resides. The family business, Overmars Vastgoed bv, was founded in the 1990s and continues to invest in, amongst other things, commercial and residential buildings. With his father Ben and brother Edwin, he also runs a car restoration service named Overmars Classic Cars. In 2002, Overmars appeared in the Quote 500 richest Dutch people list for the first time, at number 441.

In December 2022, Overmars was admitted to hospital after suffering a &quot;mild stroke&quot;. In reality, it was later revealed that he had suffered a cardiac arrest, and will need a year to recover as his heart presently is only able to pump blood at 30% efficiency.

<doc id="645631" wikidata="Q7573241" url="?curid=645631" title="Spanish match">
<text>The Spanish match was a proposed marriage between Prince Charles, the son of King James VI &amp; I of Kingdom of Scotland and England, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, the daughter of Philip III of Spain. Negotiations took place over the period 1614 to 1623, and during this time became closely related to aspects of British foreign and religious policy, before breaking down completely.

The policy, unpopular with England&#x27;s Protestant House of Commons, where the recent Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) had not been forgotten, was initiated during the embassy to England of Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, conde de Gondomar, who arrived in London in 1614 with the offer that Spain would not interfere with James&#x27;s troubled rule in Ireland if James would restrain the English &quot;privateers&quot; in Spanish American waters. Further, he proposed a marriage alliance, offering a dowry of £500,000 (later increased to £600,000), which seemed especially attractive to James after the failure of the Parliament of 1614 to provide him with the financial subsidies he requested.

The climax of the ensuing decade of high-level negotiation to secure a marriage between the leading Protestant and Catholic royal families of Europe occurred in 1623 in Madrid, with the embassy of the Prince Charles and James&#x27;s favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. The wedding never took place despite the signing of a marriage contract by King James; criticism instead led to the dissolution of Parliament.

==Background==
A Spanish marriage for Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, Charles&#x27;s elder brother who had died in 1612, had been proposed by his mother Anne of Denmark. After his death she supported the idea of a Spanish marriage for her daughter Elizabeth, but in 1613 Elizabeth married a prominent Protestant German prince. For her second son Charles, there were candidate marriages mooted from Savoy and Tuscany, as well as Spain and France. From 1614 to her own death in 1619, Queen Anne gave some support to a Spanish match, preferring at times a French marriage, and recognising that the Spanish proposals were entirely based on self-interest. A point brought up against it in 1620 was that the previous &quot;Spanish matches&quot;, those that had brought Catherine of Aragon to England, and Philip II of Spain to marry Mary I, had in the popular memory turned out badly.

==James I&#x27;s policy==
At the beginning of 1618 James I and VI was in a strong diplomatic position. His efforts against wars in Europe had been largely effective, and his own status as a Protestant ruler who was on good terms with Catholic powers was high. Success in reducing the religious factor in international relations then deteriorated for James, in parallel with the failure of the Spanish match, with the onset of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1618 he was still concerned with detailed moves to improve his relationship with Spain, such as the translation of the anti-Calvinist Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, and the execution of the buccaneering Sir Walter Raleigh.

On the domestic front, the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between his heir Charles, Prince of Wales from 1616, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, was a potential source of income for James, who sought ways to rule without depending on the Commons for subsidies. The policy of the Spanish match was supported by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the &quot;Spanish Party&quot;—but deeply distrusted by some Protestant groups in England. Sentiment was voiced vociferously in the Commons when James called his first parliament for seven years in 1621 to raise funds for a military expedition in support of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, his son-in-law.

There was in fact no chance that Pope Paul V would have issued the required dispensation for the Infanta to marry a Protestant. This fact was known to the Spanish king, but apparently Gondomar was kept in ignorance of the correspondence. Paul V died early in 1621, and his successor Pope Gregory XV was thought amenable to the idea of the match. James sent George Gage to Rome to lobby, putting the case on behalf of English Catholics. The matter was passed to a small group of cardinals, who emphasised that improved treatment for English Catholics was a prerequisite.

==Political opposition==
By the 1620s, events on the continent had stirred up anti-Catholic feeling to a new pitch. A conflict had broken out between the Catholic Holy Roman Empire and the Protestant Electoral Palatinate, when the Bohemians deposed Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor as their king and elected James&#x27;s son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, in his place, triggering the Thirty Years&#x27; War. James reluctantly summoned parliament as the only means to raise the funds necessary to assist his daughter Elizabeth and Frederick, who had been ousted from Prague by Emperor Ferdinand in 1620. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick, and on the other called for a war directly against Spain.

In November 1621, led by Sir Edward Coke, the Commons framed a petition asking not only for a war with Spain but for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. When James heard of the petition, he is said to have cried, &quot;God give me patience&quot;. James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment; to which provocation they reacted by issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech. James wrote: &quot;We cannot with patience endure our subjects to use such anti-monarchical words to us concerning their liberties, except they had subjoined that they were granted unto them by the grace and favour of our predecessors.&quot; Urged on by Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.

==Opposition literature, censorship and imprisonment==

Outside the political process, feelings that were both anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic ran high. Pamphleteering attacks aimed at the Spanish match through the court, deploying &quot;defamation, forgery and partisan distortion&quot;. Smears in the form of fabricated personal details about figures associated with the Spanish Party were published, especially by the Puritan faction. Thomas Scott is particularly noted for his part in this campaign, from 1619.

In 1620, and again in 1621, James issued decrees against writing or speaking on state affairs. John Everard preached against the match in February 1621, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, and spent about half a year in the Gatehouse Prison. When Robert Mason wrote in 1622 to his friend Thomas Hobbes about public opinion on the match, criticising James&#x27;s policy and noting Gondomar&#x27;s skill in gaining support for it by holding out the prospect of the Palatinate being returned to Frederick V, he hedged his comments with pleas for secrecy.

Thomas Middleton&#x27;s 1624 play &quot;A Game at Chess&quot; allegorized the events surrounding the Spanish match. It was particularly harsh on Gondomar, represented by the Black Knight. Plays were in any case censored, and Henry Herbert as Master of the Revels passed it for performance; it was a short-lived &quot;succès de scandale&quot; in August 1624. It has been suggested that Herbert connived at the unheard-of dramatic liberties taken in portraying members of the royal family, in a court now dominated by the anti-Spanish party. Plays of the previous two years that had Spanish settings, Thomas Middleton and William Rowley&#x27;s &quot;The Changeling&quot; and Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;Match Me in London&quot;, have been given readings that set them against the match, necessarily more covertly.

==Charles in Spain==

Denied the military option, James ignored public opinion and returned to the Spanish match as his only hope of restoring the possessions of Elizabeth and Frederick. The position was altered, however, by the death of Philip III of Spain, in 1621. With the accession of Philip IV of Spain the Spanish proponent of the marriage, Gondomar, lost influence to Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares.

When negotiations began to drag, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham decided to seize the initiative and travel to Castile incognito, to win the Infanta directly. Travelling under the names Thomas and John Smith, they arrived at the residence of the English ambassador in Madrid, the &quot;House of the Seven Chimneys&quot; on the Plaza de Rey, on 7 March 1623 (OS). The ambassador, John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol, had been given no warning of the Prince&#x27;s intentions, and Philip IV was astonished. Charles and Buckingham were ignorant of the key facts, that Maria Anna was strongly averse to marrying a non-Catholic, and that the Spanish, who had been protracting the marriage negotiations to keep English troops out of the war, would never agree to such a match unless James and Charles pledged to repeal the anti-Catholic Penal Laws.

They were welcomed at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid. The reception at court and the journey was described by the author Andrés de Almansa y Mendoza. Richard Wynn, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, sailed with other members of the royal household in the &quot;Adventure&quot; from Portsmouth to join the Prince. Wynn&#x27;s account of the journey describes the costumes of Spanish country people and aristocrats, and the difficulties and uncertainties of the journey.

During the visit, Spanish national poet Pedro Calderón de la Barca made his debut as a playwright with &quot;Amor, honor y poder&quot; (&quot;Love, honor, and power&quot;), a verse drama about the life of King Edward III of England, which was performed before the Prince at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid on 29 June 1623.

Francis Stuart sailed to Castile in the &quot;St George&quot; bringing the patent creating the titles Duke of Buckingham and Earl of Coventry. He also brought a parcel of jewels for Prince Charles, many of which had belonged to Anne of Denmark. These included; the jewelled sword given to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales during the masque &quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot;; the &quot;Portugal diamond&quot;; the &quot;Cobham pearl&quot;; jewelled head attires; and a ring with a diamond frog and a ruby set in its head.

Though a secret treaty was signed, the Prince and Duke returned to England in October without the Infanta. On their way to Santander they visited El Escorial, the Palace of Valsain, the Alcázar of Segovia, Valladolid, Palencia, and Frómista. There was open delight shown by sections of the British people.

==The Privy Council==
From 1617 the negotiations for the match had been handled by the Privy Council. In fact it was considered that there was a need for confidential dealings with Spanish counterparts, and a subcommittee of the council was set up for that reason; which later became a vehicle for discussion of foreign policy more generally, and persisted into the next reign. The last word on the Spanish Match was the vote in the Privy Council to reject the Spanish terms, taking place in January 1624.

==Aftermath==
Affronted by their treatment in Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James&#x27;s Spanish policy on its head: they called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg Spanish Empire. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy had shifted from James to Charles and Buckingham, who pressured the King to declare war and engineered the impeachment and imprisonment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, when he opposed the idea on grounds of cost.

Lord Bristol, though entirely blameless, was made the scapegoat for the failure of the match: he was recalled in disgrace, ordered to remain on his estates and later imprisoned for a time in the Tower of London. Charles thus antagonised one of his most gifted and trustworthy public servants, and they were not fully reconciled until the outbreak of the English Civil War.

The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to financing a war against Spain, a stance which was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign. Charles eventually married Henrietta Maria of France.

==Gifts of jewels==
Charles was supplied with various jewels from the English royal collection to give as gifts. King James sent advice on this gift giving to his son in Spain. When Charles gave his farewells to the Spanish court, his presents included; to the King, a sword set with diamonds; to the Queen, two large diamonds, and a pair of earrings including diamonds as big as a bean; to the Infanta, a string of 250 pear shaped pearls; to Don Carlos, a pointed diamond; to the Cardinal, a pectoral of topazes, diamonds, and pearls; to Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, the &quot;Portugal diamond&quot; set with a pendant pearl, as a substitute for the famous La Peregrina pearl; to the Countess of Olivares, a diamond cross; to her daughter, Lady Maria de Guzman, a ring; four jewels each to the Duke of Híjar, the Marquis of Mondéjar, the King&#x27;s Confessor, and the Bishop of Segovia; diamond rings for the gentlemen of the King&#x27;s chamber; chains of gold for 14 pages, gold rings for the royal archers; to the Conde de la Puebla Maestre a chain of diamonds and a miniature of portrait of himself set with diamonds.

A ship, the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, was sent to Spain to collect jewels returned to the English ambassador in July 1624. The ship was threatened by a storm during the return voyage.

==In popular fiction==
William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;The Spanish Match&quot; concerns itself with the journey to Spain and the negotiations. The visit of Prince Charles is the background of the novel &quot;El capitán Alatriste&quot; (1996) by Arturo Pérez-Reverte and its film adaptation.

In 2011, Sophia Institute Press released a novel based on historical events entitled &quot;The Spanish Match.&quot;

The Spanish Match is a large part of the plot in episode 7 of the Starz miniseries Mary &amp; George.

<text>Binary Research Ltd was a company founded in Auckland, New Zealand, by Murray Haszard in 1991 after the sale of his previous company, B32 Software.

Binary Research initially considered developing competitors to the file transfer programs Blast and Laplink. The product to compete with Blast was dropped at an early stage, but a program to transfer files over parallel or serial cables was developed and marketed from 1994 to 1996 under several names, including &quot;Beam&quot;, &quot;UniBeam&quot; and &quot;LinkWiz&quot;. This program was available in DOS, Windows 3.x, OS/2 2.0 and SCO Unix versions, and claimed to transfer files more rapidly than Laplink at that time. Later versions of the program could also transfer files using a network cable.

Beam was not a financial success, as Laplink was the dominant product in that marketplace.

Binary Research&#x27;s next product, arising from the file transfer and parallel port technologies of Beam, was Ghost, first sold in 1996. Ghost pioneered the field of disk cloning software. A network of agents was set up around the world, and a branch of Binary Research Ltd, Binary Research International Inc, was established in Glendale, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin as a sales and support centre.

Ghost was a very successful product, but Binary Research was a small company and was unable to drive the global sales force which Ghost needed. In 1998, Murray Haszard looked for a company which could acquire and develop Ghost further. Symantec expressed an interest, and after a unanimous vote of approval by Binary Research&#x27;s New Zealand employees, Ghost was purchased by Symantec for US$27.5 million in July 1998. Almost all New Zealand employees of Binary Research became Symantec employees, and Ghost continued to be developed in Auckland for over ten years.

Binary Research Ltd was closed down after the acquisition, but Binary Research International Inc. continues as a reseller of Ghost, and has expanded into other software products. One of the most significant products BRI distributed was the UIU (Universal Imaging Utility) which facilitates the creation of an image that can be deployed to a vast range of hardware, irrespective of brand, components and drivers.

<text>Happy families is a traditional British card game usually with a specially made set of picture cards, featuring illustrations of fictional families of four, most often based on occupation types. The object of the game is to collect complete families, and the game is similar to Go Fish and Quartets.

In Germany and Austria, the game is known as Quartett or Ablegspiel (in Upper Austria and Styria) and is not restricted to sets of four people, but covers other topics such as farm animals or tractors. The game can also be adapted for use with an ordinary set of playing cards.

==Gameplay==
The player whose turn it is asks another player for a specific card: the asking player must hold a card of the same family. If the asked player has the card, they must give it to the requester, and the requester then takes another turn. If the asked player does not have the card, they say &quot;not at home&quot; and it becomes the asked player&#x27;s turn.

When a player completes a family they place it face-down in front of them. Play continues in this way until no families are separated among different players. The player with the most completed families wins.

==Development ==
The game was devised by John Jaques Jr. who is also credited with popularizing tiddlywinks, ludo and snakes and ladders, and first published before the Great Exhibition of 1851. Cards following Jaques&#x27; original designs, with grotesque illustrations possibly by Sir John Tenniel (there was no official credit), are still being made.

==Family members==

The names of the family members are structured as follows, where X stands for a surname and Y for an occupation.
* Mr X the Y
* Mrs X the Y&#x27;s wife
* Master X the Y&#x27;s son
* Miss X the Y&#x27;s daughter

The eleven families in Jaques&#x27; original edition were:

<text>Vallès Occidental () is a comarca (county) in the Barcelona region in Catalonia (Spain). It has two capitals, Sabadell and Terrassa. Along with Vallès Oriental, it forms the historical Vallès region.

== Physical geography ==

Vallès Occidental borders the comarques of Bages (to the north), Vallès Oriental (to the north and east), Baix Llobregat (to the west), and Barcelonès (to the south). It centers on the Catalan prelittoral depression, limited to the west by the River Llobregat and to the east by the River Caldes. The northern part of the comarca is mountainous. From west to east, it contains part of the Obac range (924m altitude at Castellsapera); the massifs of Sant Llorenç de Munt (1095m at La Mola and 1053m at Montcau) and Puig de la Creu (664m); and the Sant Sadurní (954m) and Farell cliffs (789m). At the south of the comarca is the Collserola range (512m), which forms part of the Catalan Littoral. Between these various ranges is the valley that gives its name to the comarca.
The valley actually composes two separate watersheds, the basins of the Llobregat and Besòs.

The Llobregat watershed lies to the west of the axis that runs from Obac to Tibidabo (culminating point of the Collserola range), passing through Matadepera, Sant Quirze del Vallès, Bellaterra, and Sant Cugat del Vallès. Tributaries of the Llobregat include the Canyamssos, the Rubí and the Vallvidrera. East of that axis, the watershed of the Besòs includes the rivers Ripoll and Caldes, (the latter forming the eastern border of the comarca).

=== Major natural parks ===
* Parc Natural de Sant Llorenç de Munt i Serra de l&#x27;Obac
* Parc de Collserola

=== Hiking trails ===
Vallès Occidental has several notable official hiking trails, known as 
&quot;senders de gran recorregut&quot;.

* GR-6: Barcelona – Montserrat (Classic route to Montserrat).
* GR-96: Barcelona – Montserrat (Roman road to Montserrat).
* GR-97: Abrera – Sant Celoni (From the Llobregat to the Tordera).
* GR-173: Circumnavigation of Vallès Occidental.

==Human and economic geography==
Industry is concentrated in the south, coinciding with the flattest land in the comarca. The principal industrial cities are the co-capitals Sabadell and Terrassa, as well as Rubí and Cerdanyola del Vallès. The most important industries are textiles, mechanical engineering, metallurgy, machinery, electrical equipment, construction, chemicals, paper, and the processing of food products. An industrial crisis at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s led to a greater importance for the commercial and service sectors, especially computer-related work.

The north remains primarily rural. Many of the residences there now function as second homes.

===Municipalities===
=== Transportation ===
Much of Catalonia&#x27;s transportation network passes through Vallès Occidental, with roads, railroads, etc. crossing the valley in various directions.

====Motorways====
* AP-7 crosses Vallès in an east-west direction. Heading west, it connects Vallès with Tarragona, València and the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula, similarly to the A-2/AP-2 (which connects Barcelona, Lleida, and Zaragoza). Heading east, it connects Vallès with the province of Girona and with France.
* C-58 crosses the comarca south to north, connecting Barcelona with Manresa by wy of Montcada i Reixac, Ripollet, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Sabadell, and Terrassa.
* Manresa, Terrassa, and Barcelona are also connected by C-16 or the Vallvidrera Tunnels, by way of Sant Cugat del Vallès and Rubí.
* C-33 connects Montcada i Reixac and Mollet del Vallès, connecting the northern part of Barcelona with autopista AP-7 to the northeast.

====Highways====
* N-150, the principal highway of the comarca, crosses south to north, connecting Barcelona to Terrassa by way of Montcada i Reixac, Ripollet, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barberà del Vallès, and Sabadell. Beyond Terrassa, various &quot;carreteres comarcals&quot; complete the comarca&#x27;s network:
* C-1413 starts at Molins de Rei, connects to the N-II and N-340 and the motorway A-2, and passes through Rubí, Sabadell, and Sentmenat before connecting finally to the N-152 at the heights of Centelles.
* C-1415 connects Vilafranca del Penedès (N-340), Sant Sadurní d&#x27;Anoia, and Martorell (A-7, N-II) to Granollers and Mataró (N-II, A-19) passing through Terrassa, Matadepera, Castellar del Vallès, and Sentmenat.
* C-155 connects Sabadell to Granollers, passing through Polinyà and Palau de Plegamans.

====Railroads====
Both railroad companies that operate in Catalonia have lines in Vallès Occidental. Renfe&#x27;s Barcelona-Lleida line passes through Manresa.
The Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya have the &quot;Metro del Vallès&quot;, connecting Barcelona to Sabadell and Terrassa.

====Airports====
Most air traffic for Vallès Occidental comes through Prat airport in neighboring Baix Llobregat. Sabadell Airport is used for sport flying, as a base for firemen, and for air freight.

<text>The big things of Australia are large structures, some of which are novelty architecture and some sculptures. In Australia, big things have come to be seen as a uniquely Australian phenomenon, although they emerged at the same time as the so-called Roadside Giants (fibreglass sculptures of things) of the United States. These structures have become affectionately known landmarks scattered throughout the country. In 2022, there were just over 1075 big things in Australia. There are big things in each state and some territories in continental Australia.

==History and importance==
Originally, many of these big things were conceived as tourist traps strategically placed along major roads, enticing travelers to make a stop and explore the surrounding areas. They served as eye-catching attractions, drawing attention to local businesses and promoting tourism in the region. Over time, these structures have evolved beyond their initial purpose and have acquired a special place in Australian culture.

The big things have garnered significant attention from locals and visitors, becoming something of a cult phenomenon. Travelling to visit and photograph these structures has become a popular activity, inspiring road trips where enthusiasts aim to see as many big things as possible. These journeys often culminate in group photographs, using the larger-than-life structures as unique backdrops and symbols of shared experiences.

Many of the big things have been recognised as works of folk art. Their whimsical and often exaggerated designs reflect the creativity and ingenuity of their creators. Several big things have been heritage-listed, ensuring their preservation and contributing to the country&#x27;s cultural heritage. These listed structures serve as reminders of the unique character and history of the regions they are located in.

Despite their popularity, some Big Things have faced controversies and potential demolition threats. Factors such as maintenance costs, changing priorities, or debates over their aesthetic value have ignited discussions regarding the delicate balance between preserving cultural icons and allocating resources for alternative purposes.

The influence of Australia&#x27;s big things extends beyond the country&#x27;s borders. These unique structures have inspired the creation of oversized sculptures and replicas in other parts of the world, highlighting the impact of Australian creativity and cultural exports.

<text>This England was a quarterly magazine published in England from 1968 to 2025. It had a large readership among expatriates. It concentrated on the traditional values and customs of the English people, particularly those of rural and small-town England.

==History==
The magazine was started in 1968 by Roy Faiers of Lincolnshire, who held it as a private company (This England International Ltd.). Faiers remained editor-in-chief until 2009, when he sold the company to DC Thomson, owners of the &quot;Sunday Post&quot;, &quot;Beano&quot;, &quot;Dandy&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Friend&quot;, &quot;My Weekly&quot; and other publications. Faiers was succeeded as editor by his former deputy editor, Stephen Garnett, who in turn was succeeded by current editor, Angela Linforth.

The name &quot;This England&quot; comes from the declamations of John of Gaunt in Act II, Scene I of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Richard II&quot;: &quot;This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle... This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.&quot;

In January 2025, DC Thomson announced &quot;This England&quot; will cease.

==Content==
The magazine started with the slogan &quot;As refreshing as a cup of tea!&quot; Current issues describe themselves as &quot;For all who love our green and pleasant land&quot;.

&quot;This England&quot; is an apolitical celebration of England&#x27;s people, places, art and culture. Content focuses on England&#x27;s past and present, with regular feature strands including “Historic Homes of England”; “The Prime Ministers” which looks back on Britain&#x27;s former PMs and“Explore England” which provides a travel itinerary for pockets of the country in each issue. “Great Britons” focuses on England&#x27;s exceptional characters past and present; “Made in England” celebrates current English makers and “Heritage Church” features a range of English churches.

Although Jeremy Paxman once remarked in his &quot;The English&quot;, p. 79, that the magazine&#x27;s greatest enemy was &quot;the march of time&quot;, claiming that &quot;not one article in the magazine looks forward to the future”, that has changed more recently.

As well as its regulars, it also has plenty of quirky one-off features on anything from the birth of aviation to highway women to England&#x27;s first tea plantation.

<text>State of Play is a British television drama series, written by Paul Abbott and directed by David Yates, that was first broadcast on BBC One in 2003. The series tells the story of a newspaper&#x27;s investigation into the death of a political researcher, and centres on the relationship between the leading journalist, Cal McCaffrey, and his old friend, Stephen Collins, who is a Member of Parliament and the murdered woman&#x27;s employer. The series is primarily set in London and was produced in-house by the BBC in association with the independent production company Endor Productions. The series stars David Morrissey, John Simm, Kelly Macdonald, Polly Walker, Bill Nighy, and James McAvoy in the main roles.

The series was Abbott&#x27;s first attempt to write a political thriller, and he initially made the majority of the plot up as he went along. He was prompted to write the series after BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter asked him whether he would consider writing a piece &quot;bigger&quot; than anything he had written so far in his career. The serial was Abbott&#x27;s third major writing project for the channel, following &quot;Clocking Off&quot; and &quot;Linda Green&quot;. The series was also a major turning point in David Yates&#x27;s directorial career, as he began to direct various high-profile television projects following his work on the series.

The six-part series was a primetime broadcast on BBCOne on Sunday evenings at 9:00pm from 18 May to 22 June 2003. Episodes two to five were initially premiered on the digital television channel BBCFour at 10:00pm on the nights of the preceding episodes&#x27; BBCOne broadcast. However, episode six was held back for a premiere on BBCOne, so as not to allow the final twists to be spoiled for those who did not have access to digital television. In 2004, the series ran in the United States on the BBC America cable channel. In 2005, the series was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide, in a two-disc set. Episode one features an audio commentary from Abbott and Yates, and episode six a commentary from Yates, producer Hilary Bevan-Jones, and editor Mark Day.

The success of the series and its favourable impression on BBC executives led to Abbott being commissioned to write a sequel, before the first series had even been aired. In 2006, however, a second series appeared to have been abandoned, with Abbott telling Mark Lawson on &quot;Front Row&quot; for BBC Radio 4 in November that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t find a way to make the story work&quot;.

==Plot==
While investigating the murder of fifteen-year-old teenager Kelvin Stagg in what appears to be a drug-related gangland killing, journalist Cal McCaffrey of &quot;The Herald&quot; (John Simm) and his colleagues Della Smith (Kelly MacDonald) and editor Cameron Foster (Bill Nighy) find a connection with the coincidental death on the same day of Sonia Baker (Shauna MacDonald), a young political researcher for rising star MP Stephen Collins (David Morrissey). As their investigation progresses, a love affair scandal between Collins and Baker rapidly emerges and they uncover not only a connection between the murders, but also a political conspiracy having links to petroleum industry-backed corruption of high-ranking British Government ministers.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
Reviewing the first episode for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper the day after it had aired, Gareth McLean wrote that &quot;...it&#x27;s bloody magic. The story is gripping, the acting is ace and Paul Abbott&#x27;s script is outstanding. His ear for dialogue, and for different voices, is exceptional. The exposition is swift, nifty and joyously unclunky. The characters are credible and rounded. If you can count the best dramas of recent years on the fingers of both hands, it&#x27;s time to grow a new finger.&quot; Other newspaper critics were similarly impressed with the opening instalment. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Paul Hoggart wrote that &quot;Two excellent performances [from Morrissey and Simm] ensure that the relationship has a turbulent dynamism that is credible and engaging.&quot; James Walton in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was more cautious, feeling that the opening episode had been promising but the serial as a whole still had the potential to go wrong. &quot;At this stage however, the programme is certainly good enough to make me hope not and to ensure that I&#x27;ll be back next week to find out.&quot;

The consensus appeared to be that the serial maintained its quality to the end. Previewing episode four, Jonathan Wright of &quot;The Guide&quot; section in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;a political conspiracy thriller that&#x27;s as buttock-clenchingly tense as &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, as cynical about the British political system as &quot;House of Cards&quot;, and stands comparisons to both.&quot; The television critic of &quot;The Independent&quot;, Tom Sutcliffe, wrote of the final episode: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that a thriller can end in anything other than anti-climax. If it has been good you&#x27;re sad it&#x27;s over, and if it ends badly you&#x27;re quite likely to feel that you&#x27;ve been duped. Paul Abbott&#x27;s &quot;State of Play&quot;, which has had me swallowing double doses on a Sunday evening whenever the schedules allowed, left us with the first kind of let-down rather than the second.&quot;

Bill Nighy won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his role. The series also won a Peabody Award in 2004 and won BAFTAs for Best Sound (Fiction/Entertainment) and Best Editing (Fiction/Entertainment). It was nominated, but did not win, in the Best Actor category again, for Morrissey; in the Best Drama Serial category; Best Original Television Music and Best Photography and Lighting. It also won major awards from the Royal Television Society, Banff Television Festival, Broadcasting Press Guild, Cologne Conference, Directors Guild of Great Britain, Edgar Awards, and the Monte Carlo TV Festival.

==Adaptation==

&quot;State of Play&quot; was adapted into an Americanized feature film that was released in the United States in April 2009. The plot retained substantial similarities to the original six-hour series, retaining the main characters, but with its location changed to Washington, D.C., and with certain aspects condensed and changed in order to fit the two-hour format.

The film was directed by Kevin Macdonald from a screenplay written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy, Peter Morgan, and Billy Ray. Ben Affleck, Russell Crowe, Rachel McAdams and Helen Mirren appear in the lead roles. In an April 2009 interview to promote the film, Affleck, who plays Congressman Stephen Collins, said he drew on the experiences of Gary Condit, Eliot Spitzer, and John Edwards while preparing for the role. The film was generally well received, but not as lauded as the series.

<text>Charles Devens Jr. (April 4, 1820 – January 7, 1891) was an American lawyer, jurist and statesman. He also served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, Devens graduated from Boston Latin School and eventually Harvard College in 1838, and from the Harvard Law School in 1840. He was admitted to the bar in Franklin County, Massachusetts, where he practiced law from 1841 to 1849.

In 1848, he was a Whig member of the Massachusetts Senate. From 1849 to 1853, Devens was United States Marshal for Massachusetts, in which capacity he was called upon in 1851 to remand the fugitive slave, Thomas Sims, to slavery. This he felt constrained to do, much against his personal desire; subsequently, he attempted in vain to purchase Sims&#x27;s freedom, and many years later appointed him to a position in the United States Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.

Devens practiced law at Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1853 until 1861.

==Civil War==

On April 16, 1861, Devens gave an impassioned speech at Mechanics Hall in Worcester in support of Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 volunteers. To a large crowd he called upon the young men of Worcester to &quot;rise and go with&quot; him to the &quot;rescue of Washington&quot;. Three days later, he was appointed major of the 3rd Massachusetts Rifle Battalion.
He was appointed as colonel of the 15th Massachusetts Infantry in July 1861 and wounded at the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff in Virginia in October.


Although still recovering, Devens was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in April 1862 and assigned command of the 1st Brigade/1st Division. He was wounded a second time at the Battle of Seven Pines and spent most of the summer recovering. His brigade was not heavily involved in the Maryland Campaign. Shortly afterwards, it was reassigned to the VI Corps. Devens commanded the 2nd Brigade/3rd Division/VI Corps during the Battle of Fredericksburg.

In January 1863, Devens was given command of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, VI Corps. After Maj. Gen Oliver O. Howard took command of the XI Corps, he appointed Devens as a division commander, and at Chancellorsville he was wounded a third time. According to a report by Gen. Steward L. Woodford, who served with him, Devens remounted his horse, stayed with his men and did not go to the hospital until his men had bivouacked (set up camp).

Devens distinguished himself at the Battle of Cold Harbor, while commanding the 3rd Division/XVIII Corps in Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Overland Campaign. During the final stages of the Siege of Petersburg, he commanded the 3rd Division of the XXIV Corps.

Devens&#x27;s troops were the first to occupy Richmond after its fall in April 1865.

After the war, Devens became a companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Postbellum==
On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Devens for the award of the honorary grade of brevet major general, United States Volunteers, to rank from April 3, 1865, for services during the Richmond campaign, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 12, 1866. Devens remained in the army for a year as commander of the military district of Charleston, South Carolina, before mustering out and returning home. He later served as the fifth Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1873 to 1875 and was also a veteran companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Devens was also a key figure in the investigation into the unlawful execution of Confederate veteran Calvin Crozier by soldiers of the 33rd Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops, at Newberry, South Carolina in September 1865 following an altercation. Over Devens&#x27;s strong objections the officer who took responsibility for the lynching was exonerated and returned to duty.

He was a judge of the Massachusetts superior court, from 1867 to 1873, and was an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from 1873 to 1877, and again from 1881 to 1891. From 1877 to 1881, he was Attorney General of the United States in the Cabinet of President Rutherford B. Hayes. Devens was a close friend to President Hayes and his family, and was a favorite of Washington society during his time in office.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1878.

Charles Devens died of heart failure in Boston, Massachusetts in 1891, and is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Memorials==

In 1906, the city of Worcester, Massachusetts, erected an equestrian statue of Charles Devens in front of the former Worcester Court House, located on Court Hill. The statue was originally located on the front middle of the Courthouse area, it was later relocated to the front side.

Camp Devens, later Fort Devens, was established in 1917 in the Massachusetts towns of Ayer, Harvard, Lancaster and Shirley, and named after the general.

<text>The Oriental magpie-robin (Copsychus saularis) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but now considered an Old World flycatcher. They are distinctive black and white birds with a long tail that is held upright as they forage on the ground or perch conspicuously. Occurring across most of the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia, they are common birds in urban gardens as well as forests. They are particularly well known for their songs and were once popular as cagebirds.

The oriental magpie-robin is considered the national bird of Bangladesh.

==Description==
This species is long, including the long tail, which is usually held cocked upright when hopping on the ground. When they are singing a song the tail is normal like other birds. It is similar in shape to the smaller European robin, but is longer-tailed. The male has black upperparts, head and throat apart from a white shoulder patch. The underparts and the sides of the long tail are white. Females are greyish black above and greyish white under. Young birds have scaly brown upperparts and head.

The nominate race is found on the Indian subcontinent and the females of this race are the palest. The females of the Andaman Islands race &quot;andamanensis&quot; are darker, heavier-billed and shorter-tailed. The Sri Lankan race &quot;ceylonensis&quot; (formerly included with the peninsular Indian populations south of the Kaveri River) and southern nominate individuals have the females nearly identical to the males in shade. The eastern populations, the ones in Bangladesh and Bhutan, have more black on the tail and were formerly named &quot;erimelas&quot;. The populations in Myanmar (Burma) and further south are named as the race &quot;musicus&quot;. A number of other races have been named across the range, including &quot;prosthopellus&quot; (Hong Kong), &quot;nesiotes&quot;, &quot;zacnecus&quot;, &quot;nesiarchus&quot;, &quot;masculus&quot;, &quot;pagiensis&quot;, &quot;javensis&quot;, &quot;problematicus&quot;, &quot;amoenus&quot;, &quot;adamsi&quot;, &quot;pluto&quot;, &quot;deuteronymus&quot; and &quot;mindanensis&quot;. However, many of these are not well-marked and the status of some of them is disputed. Some, like &quot;mindanensis&quot;, have now been usually recognized as full species (the Philippine magpie-robin). There is more geographic variation in the plumage of females than in that of the males.

It is mostly seen close to the ground, hopping along branches or foraging in leaf-litter on the ground with a cocked tail. Males sing loudly from the top of trees or other high perches during the breeding season.

==Etymology==

The Indian name of &quot;dhyal&quot; or &quot;dhayal&quot; has led to many confusions. It was first used by Eleazar Albin (&quot;dialbird&quot;) in 1737 (Suppl. N. H. Birds, i. p. 17, pls. xvii. xviii.), and Levaillant (Ois. d&#x27;Afr. iii. p. 50) thought it referred to a sun dial and he called it &quot;Cadran&quot;. Thomas C. Jerdon wrote (B. India, ii. p. 116) that Linnaeus, thinking it had some connection with a sun-dial, called it &quot;solaris&quot;, by &quot;lapsus pennae&quot;, &quot;saularis.&quot; This was, however, identified by Edward Blyth as an incorrect interpretation and that it was a Latinization of a Hindi word [which could mean a &quot;hundred songs&quot; (&quot;सौ+लोरी&quot;)]. A male bird was sent with this Hindi name from Madras by surgeon Edward Bulkley to James Petiver, who first described the species (Ray, Synops. Meth. Avium, p. 197). 
==Distribution and habitat==
This magpie-robin is a resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and eastern Pakistan, eastern Indonesia, Thailand, south China, Malaysia, and Singapore.

The Oriental magpie-robin is found in open woodland and cultivated areas often close to human habitations.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Magpie-robins breed mainly from March to July in India and January to June in south-east Asia. Males sing from high perches during courtship. The display of the male involves puffing up the feathers, raising the bill, fanning the tail and strutting. They nest in tree hollows or niches in walls or building, often adopting nest boxes. They line the cavity with grass. The female is involved in most of the nest building, which happens about a week before the eggs are laid. Four or five eggs are laid at intervals of 24 hours and these are oval and usually pale blue green with brownish speckles that match the color of hay. The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 8 to 14 days. The nests are said to have a characteristic odour.

Females spend more effort on feeding the young than males. Males are quite aggressive in the breeding season and will defend their territory. They respond to the singing of intruders and even their reflections. Males spend more time on nest defense. Studies of the bird song show dialects with neighbours varying in their songs. The calls of many other species may be imitated as part of their song. This may indicate that birds disperse and are not philopatric. Females may sing briefly in the presence of a male. Apart from their song, they use a range of calls including territorial calls, emergence and roosting calls, threat calls, submissive calls, begging calls and distress calls. The typical mobbing calls is a harsh hissing &quot;krshhh&quot;.

The diet of magpie-robins includes mainly insects and other invertebrates. Although mainly insectivorous, they are known to occasionally take flower nectar, geckos, leeches, centipedes and even fish.

They are often active late at dusk. They sometimes bathe in rainwater collected on the leaves of a tree.
==Status==
This species is considered one of &quot;least concern&quot; globally, but in some areas it is declining.

In Singapore they were common in the 1920s, but declined in the 1970s, presumably due to competition from introduced common mynas. Poaching for the pet bird trade and habitat changes have also affected them and they are locally protected by law.

This species has few avian predators. Several pathogens and parasites have been reported. Avian malaria parasites have been isolated from the species, while H4N3 and H5N1 infection has been noted in a few cases. Parasitic nematodes of the eye have been described.

==In culture==
Oriental magpie-robins were widely kept as cage birds for their singing abilities and for fighting in India in the past. They continue to be sold in the pet trade in parts of Southeast Asia.

Aside from being recognized as the national bird of the country, in Bangladesh, the oriental magpie-robin is common and known as the &quot;doyel&quot; or &quot;doel&quot; (). Professor Kazi Zakir Hossain of Dhaka University proposed to consider the magpie robin as the national bird of Bangladesh. The reasoning behind this is the magpie robin can be seen everywhere in towns and villages across the country. In that context, the magpie robin was declared as the national bird of Bangladesh. It is a widely used symbol in Bangladesh, appearing on a currency note, and a landmark in the city of Dhaka is named as the &quot;Doel Chattar&quot; (meaning: Doel Square).

In Sri Lanka, this bird is called &quot;Polkichcha&quot;.

In southern Thailand, this bird is known locally as &quot;Binlha&quot; ( — with another related bird, the white-rumped shama). They are frequently mentioned in contemporary songs.

<text>In graph theory, a flow network (also known as a transportation network) is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. Often in operations research, a directed graph is called a network, the vertices are called nodes and the edges are called arcs. A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a node equals the amount of flow out of it, unless it is a source, which has only outgoing flow, or sink, which has only incoming flow. A network can be used to model traffic in a computer network, circulation with demands, fluids in pipes, currents in an electrical circuit, or anything similar in which something travels through a network of nodes.
==Definition==

A network is a directed graph with a non-negative capacity function for each edge, and without multiple arcs (i.e. edges with the same source and target nodes). Without loss of generality, we may assume that if , then is also a member of . Additionally, if then we may add to &quot;E&quot; and then set the . 

If two nodes in are distinguished – one as the source and the other as the sink – then is called a flow network.

==Flows==

Flow functions model the net flow of units between pairs of nodes, and are useful when asking questions such as &quot;what is the maximum number of units that can be transferred from the source node s to the sink node t?&quot; The amount of flow between two nodes is used to represent the net amount of units being transferred from one node to the other.

The excess function represents the net flow entering a given node (i.e. the sum of the flows entering ) and is defined byformula_1A node is said to be active if (i.e. the node consumes flow), deficient if (i.e. the node produces flow), or conserving if . In flow networks, the source is deficient, and the sink is active.
Pseudo-flows, feasible flows, and pre-flows are all examples of flow functions.

:A pseudo-flow is a function of each edge in the network that satisfies the following two constraints for all nodes and :
:*&quot;Skew symmetry constraint&quot;: The flow on an arc from to is equivalent to the negation of the flow on the arc from to , that is: . The sign of the flow indicates the flow&#x27;s direction.
:*&quot;Capacity constraint&quot;: An arc&#x27;s flow cannot exceed its capacity, that is: .
:A pre-flow is a pseudo-flow that, for all , satisfies the additional constraint:
:*&quot;Non-deficient flows&quot;: The net flow &quot;entering&quot; the node is non-negative, except for the source, which &quot;produces&quot; flow. That is: for all .
:A feasible flow, or just a flow, is a pseudo-flow that, for all , satisfies the additional constraint:
:*&quot;Flow conservation constraint&quot;: The total net flow entering a node is zero for all nodes in the network except the source and the sink , that is: for all . In other words, for all nodes in the network except the source and the sink , the total sum of the incoming flow of a node is equal to its outgoing flow (i.e. formula_2, for each vertex ).
The value of a feasible flow for a network, is the net flow into the sink of the flow network, that is: . Note, the flow value in a network is also equal to the total outgoing flow of source , that is: . Also, if we define as a set of nodes in such that and , the flow value is equal to the total net flow going out of A (i.e. ). The flow value in a network is the total amount of flow from to .

==Concepts useful to flow problems==

=== Flow decomposition ===
Flow decomposition is a process of breaking down a given flow into a collection of path flows and cycle flows. Every flow through a network can be decomposed into one or more paths and corresponding quantities, such that each edge in the flow equals the sum of all quantities of paths that pass through it. Flow decomposition is a powerful tool in optimization problems to maximize or minimize specific flow parameters.

=== Adding arcs and flows ===

We do not use multiple arcs within a network because we can combine those arcs into a single arc. To combine two arcs into a single arc, we add their capacities and their flow values, and assign those to the new arc:
*Given any two nodes and , having two arcs from to with capacities and respectively is equivalent to considering only a single arc from to with a capacity equal to .
*Given any two nodes and , having two arcs from to with pseudo-flows and respectively is equivalent to considering only a single arc from to with a pseudo-flow equal to .
Along with the other constraints, the skew symmetry constraint must be remembered during this step to maintain the direction of the original pseudo-flow arc. Adding flow to an arc is the same as adding an arc with the capacity of zero.

===Residuals===
The residual capacity of an arc with respect to a pseudo-flow is denoted , and it is the difference between the arc&#x27;s capacity and its flow. That is, . From this we can construct a residual network, denoted , with a capacity function which models the amount of &quot;available&quot; capacity on the set of arcs in . More specifically, capacity function of each arc in the residual network represents the amount of flow which can be transferred from to given the current state of the flow within the network.

This concept is used in Ford–Fulkerson algorithm which computes the maximum flow in a flow network.

Note that there can be an unsaturated path (a path with available capacity) from to in the residual network, even though there is no such path from to in the original network. Since flows in opposite directions cancel out, &quot;decreasing&quot; the flow from to is the same as &quot;increasing&quot; the flow from to .

===Augmenting paths===
An augmenting path is a path in the residual network, where , , and . More simply, an augmenting path is an available flow path from the source to the sink. A network is at maximum flow if and only if there is no augmenting path in the residual network .

The bottleneck is the minimum residual capacity of all the edges in a given augmenting path. See example explained in the &quot;Example&quot; section of this article. The flow network is at maximum flow if and only if it has a bottleneck with a value equal to zero. If any augmenting path exists, its bottleneck weight will be greater than 0. In other words, if there is a bottleneck value greater than 0, then there is an augmenting path from the source to the sink. However, we know that if there is any augmenting path, then the network is not at maximum flow, which in turn means that, if there is a bottleneck value greater than 0, then the network is not at maximum flow.

The term &quot;augmenting the flow&quot; for an augmenting path means updating the flow of each arc in this augmenting path to equal the capacity of the bottleneck. Augmenting the flow corresponds to pushing additional flow along the augmenting path until there is no remaining available residual capacity in the bottleneck.

===Multiple sources and/or sinks===
Sometimes, when modeling a network with more than one source, a supersource is introduced to the graph. This consists of a vertex connected to each of the sources with edges of infinite capacity, so as to act as a global source. A similar construct for sinks is called a supersink.

==Example==
In Figure 1 you see a flow network with source labeled , sink , and four additional nodes. The flow and capacity is denoted formula_3. Notice how the network upholds the capacity constraint and flow conservation constraint. The total amount of flow from to is 5, which can be easily seen from the fact that the total outgoing flow from is 5, which is also the incoming flow to . By the skew symmetry constraint, from to is -2 because the flow from to is 2.

In Figure 2 you see the residual network for the same given flow. Notice how there is positive residual capacity on some edges where the original capacity is zero in Figure 1, for example for the edge formula_4. This network is not at maximum flow. There is available capacity along the paths formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7, which are then the augmenting paths. 

The bottleneck of the formula_5 path is equal to formula_9 formula_10 formula_11 formula_12.

==Applications==

Picture a series of water pipes, fitting into a network. Each pipe is of a certain diameter, so it can only maintain a flow of a certain amount of water. Anywhere that pipes meet, the total amount of water coming into that junction must be equal to the amount going out, otherwise we would quickly run out of water, or we would have a buildup of water. We have a water inlet, which is the source, and an outlet, the sink. A flow would then be one possible way for water to get from source to sink so that the total amount of water coming out of the outlet is consistent. Intuitively, the total flow of a network is the rate at which water comes out of the outlet.

Flows can pertain to people or material over transportation networks, or to electricity over electrical distribution systems. For any such physical network, the flow coming into any intermediate node needs to equal the flow going out of that node. This conservation constraint is equivalent to Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law.

Flow networks also find applications in ecology: flow networks arise naturally when considering the flow of nutrients and energy between different organisms in a food web. The mathematical problems associated with such networks are quite different from those that arise in networks of fluid or traffic flow. The field of ecosystem network analysis, developed by Robert Ulanowicz and others, involves using concepts from information theory and thermodynamics to study the evolution of these networks over time.

==Classifying flow problems==

The simplest and most common problem using flow networks is to find what is called the maximum flow, which provides the largest possible total flow from the source to the sink in a given graph. There are many other problems which can be solved using max flow algorithms, if they are appropriately modeled as flow networks, such as bipartite matching, the assignment problem and the transportation problem. Maximum flow problems can be solved in polynomial time with various algorithms (see table). The max-flow min-cut theorem states that finding a maximal network flow is equivalent to finding a cut of minimum capacity that separates the source and the sink, where a cut is the division of vertices such that the source is in one division and the sink is in another.

In a multi-commodity flow problem, you have multiple sources and sinks, and various &quot;commodities&quot; which are to flow from a given source to a given sink. This could be for example various goods that are produced at various factories, and are to be delivered to various given customers through the &quot;same&quot; transportation network.

In a minimum cost flow problem, each edge formula_13 has a given cost formula_14, and the cost of sending the flow formula_15 across the edge is formula_16. The objective is to send a given amount of flow from the source to the sink, at the lowest possible price.

In a circulation problem, you have a lower bound formula_17 on the edges, in addition to the upper bound formula_18. Each edge also has a cost. Often, flow conservation holds for &quot;all&quot; nodes in a circulation problem, and there is a connection from the sink back to the source. In this way, you can dictate the total flow with formula_19 and formula_20. The flow &quot;circulates&quot; through the network, hence the name of the problem.

In a network with gains or generalized network each edge has a gain, a real number (not zero) such that, if the edge has gain &quot;g&quot;, and an amount &quot;x&quot; flows into the edge at its tail, then an amount &quot;gx&quot; flows out at the head.

In a source localization problem, an algorithm tries to identify the most likely source node of information diffusion through a partially observed network. This can be done in linear time for trees and cubic time for arbitrary networks and has applications ranging from tracking mobile phone users to identifying the originating source of disease outbreaks.

<text>Kim Ki-duk ( ; 20 December 196011 December 2020) was a South Korean film director and screenwriter, noted for his idiosyncratic art-house cinematic works. His films have received many distinctions in the festival circuit, rendering him one of the most important contemporary Asian film directors.

His major festival awards include the Golden Lion at 69th Venice International Film Festival for &quot;Pietà&quot;, a Silver Lion for Best Director at 61st Venice International Film Festival for &quot;3-Iron&quot;, a Silver Bear for Best Director at 54th Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;Samaritan Girl&quot;, and the Un Certain Regard prize at 2011 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Arirang&quot;. His most widely known feature is &quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring&quot; (2003), included in film critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s Great Movies. Two of his films served as official submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film as South Korean entries. He gave scripts to several of his former assistant directors including Juhn Jai-hong (&quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Poongsan&quot;) and Jang Hoon (&quot;Rough Cut&quot;).

== Early life and education==
Kim was born on 20 December 1960 in Ponghwa, North Kyŏngsang. In 1990, he went to Paris to study fine arts, but instead he spent two years working there on the streets as a portrait painter. He served for five years in the South Korean Marine Corps, becoming a non-commissioned officer.

== Career ==
After returning to South Korea, Kim began his career as a screenwriter and won first prize in a screenplay contest held by the Korean Film Council in 1995. In the following year, Kim made his debut as a director with a low budget movie titled &quot;Crocodile&quot; (1996). The film received sensational reviews from movie critics in South Korea. Ki-duk said that his international breakthrough occurred with &quot;The Isle&quot; at the Toronto International Film Festival. His 2000 film &quot;Real Fiction&quot; was entered into the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival.

In 2003, Ki-duk released &quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring&quot;. The film was praised by numerous critics, including critic Peter Bradshaw, who considered the film to be his masterpiece and one of the great works of modern Korean cinema. &quot;A potent and enigmatic parable which manages to be both serene and gripping at the same time [...] It is that rarest of things - a genuinely spiritual film.&quot; The film work is included in critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s Great Movies.

In 2004, he received Best Director awards at two different film festivals, for two different films. At the Berlin International Film Festival, he was awarded for &quot;Samaritan Girl&quot; (2004), and at the Venice Film Festival he won for &quot;3-Iron&quot; (also 2004). In 2011, his documentary film &quot;Arirang&quot; received an award for best film in the Un Certain Regard category from the Cannes Film Festival. In 2012, his film &quot;Pietà&quot; received the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival. In 2015, it was announced in Beijing at the Asian Brilliant Stars, a section of the upcoming Berlin International Film Festival that Kim would direct his largest budget to date film &quot;Who Is God?,&quot; produced by Hollywood producers Stephen Castor and Jim Rygiel (three-time Academy Award winner) under the banner of their production company Its Just Us Productions, along with Chinese production company Film Carnival (Hangzhou). The film was financed by CITIC Guoan, Huafeng Investment Consultation and Its Just Us Productions, (China Daily News).

== Personal life ==

===Assault allegations===
In August 2017, an actress referred to as &quot;Actress &quot;A&quot; by prosecutors filed a complaint against Kim Ki-duk through Seoul Central District Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. In the complaint the actress accused Kim of slapping her face and forcing her to do an unscripted sex scene on the set of his film &quot;Moebius&quot;. In December 2017, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor&#x27;s Office fined Kim Ki-duk for $4,450 (KRW 5 million) for physical assault but didn&#x27;t charge him otherwise citing lack of physical evidence.

On March 6, 2018, the South Korean TV channel MBC&#x27;s investigative report show &quot;PD Notebook&quot; aired an episode titled &quot;Movie director Kim Ki-duk, Master&#x27;s Naked Face&quot; with more accusations from Actress A and two others (Actress B and C as they mentioned in the show). Actresses accused Kim and his frequent collaborator, actor Cho Jae-hyun of verbal and physical sexual harassment and rape. 
In response Kim filed false accusation and defamation suits against the accusers and &quot;PD Notebook&quot;.

After that on August 7, 2018, MBC aired a second episode of the &quot;PD Notebook&quot; show &quot;Master&#x27;s Naked Face. Aftermath&quot; with more accusations from other actresses and staff members against Kim and Cho. In that episode journalists interviewed a Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency&#x27;s Special Investigation Unit on Sexual Violence official about the cases. The official explained that the police approached the survivors and established the facts behind accusations but could not indict actor Cho and director Kim because of expired statute of limitation.

In January 2019, Seoul Central District Prosecutor&#x27;s Office decided to drop the criminal lawsuits filed by Kim Ki-duk against actresses and &quot;PD Notebook&quot; because &quot;there was neither proof that actress&#x27; initial accusation was false, nor was there evidence that the news show had been programmed with the purpose of defamation&quot;.

In March 2019 Kim Ki-duk filed another lawsuit in civil court against Actress A and &quot;PD Notebook&quot; seeking $885,740 (KRW 1 billion) in damages. The lawsuit was ruled by court in defendants&#x27; favor on October 28, 2020. The court also ordered Kim to pay legal fees for the defendants.

===Animal cruelty allegations===
The British Board of Film Classification delayed the release of Kim Ki-duk&#x27;s &quot;The Isle&quot; (2000) in the United Kingdom because of instances of animal cruelty in the film. Concerning scenes in which a frog is skinned after being beaten to death and fish are mutilated, the director stated, &quot;We cooked all the fish we used in the film and ate them, expressing our appreciation. I&#x27;ve done a lot of cruelty on animals in my films. And I will have a guilty conscience for the rest of my life.&quot;

To a U.S. interviewer who suggested that scenes such as these are &quot;very disturbing and [seem] to place an obstacle to the films reception, or... distribution, to other countries&quot;, Kim said, &quot;Yes, I did worry about that fact. But the way I see it, the food that we eat today is no different. In America you eat beef, pork, and kill all these animals. And the people who eat these animals are not concerned with their slaughter. Animals are part of this cycle of consumption. It looks more cruel onscreen, but I don&#x27;t see the difference. And yes, there&#x27;s a cultural difference, and maybe Americans will have a problem with it - but if they can just be more sensitive to what is acceptable in different countries I&#x27;d hope they wouldn&#x27;t have too many issues with what&#x27;s shown on-screen.&quot;

== Death ==
On 11 December 2020, Kim died from complications caused by COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia at the age of 59, nine days before his 60th birthday.

<doc id="645686" wikidata="Q6418402" url="?curid=645686" title="Kittanning Path">
<text>The Kittanning Path was a major east-west Native American trail that crossed the Allegheny Mountains barrier ridge connecting the Susquehanna River valleys in the center of Pennsylvania to the highlands of the Appalachian Plateau and thence to the western lands beyond drained by the Ohio River. Kittanning Village was the first major Delaware (Lenape) Indian settlement along the descent from the Allegheny Plateau.

==Nature and the path==

The path is made up of a &quot;series of path alternatives&quot; that pass through seasonally or directionally more or less difficult notches— the gaps were among only five places that could be crossed by animal power from east to west across the Appalachian Mountains west of New England. The Kittanny path (by other names) would also come to be used first by Dutch, then English and British colonial fur traders, as well as Amerindian emigrants moving westwards before and after the French and Indian War and in the post-1780 settlers migrations west of the Mountain as the American Revolution entered its final years.

For centuries the Kittanning Path, like the similar Chief Nemacolin&#x27;s Trail to the south, was the overland route through very tough country for Native American peoples. They included Iroquoian-speaking tribes, such as the Erie, Susquehannock, and the Five Nations of the Iroquois confederacy, as well as the Algonquian-speaking Lenape, Miami, and Siouan Shawnee. Early European explorers and settlers also learned to use the Indian paths to cross the Allegheny Mountains barrier ridge. 

The path made use of one of the few so-called gaps of the Allegheny that accompanied the feedwater streams draining into the Juniata River, a tributary of the Susquehanna that terminated on the Allegheny River due Northeast of Pittsburgh in what is now Armstrong County, Pennsylvania at the Native American Kittanning Village (at present-day Kittanning, Pennsylvania).

By the time of the French and Indian War, starting in 1754, Kittanning Village was believed by Europeans to be the largest Native American village in the Ohio Country west of the Alleghenies. It was located in an area of Pennsylvania that had been closed to white settlement by the original treaty of William Penn with the Lenape.

In an attempt to settle frontier borders and reduce conflict among Indian tribes, the English and Native Americans signed the Treaty of Fort Stanwix after the French and Indian War. It opened some of Pennsylvania west of the Alleghenies to white settlement. In the 1750s, this area had been the scene of a fierce raids by Native Americans against white settlement, and a major British retribution campaign.

A section of the original path is preserved in northwestern Cambria County.

== Description (East to West) ==
It began southeast of Altoona at Frankstown on the Juniata River. It ran west, crossing the Allegheny Ridge approximately 5 mi (8 km) west of Altoona at Kittanning Gap, later the location of the Horseshoe Curve railroad site.

The path ran northwest through Cambria County, passing east of Carrolltown. It entered Indiana County approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) south of Cherry Tree at &quot;Canoe Place&quot;, the uppermost
Native American canoe portage on the West Branch of the Susquehanna.

It followed a southwest course, through Yellow Creek State Park, then along the headwaters of Two Lick Creek, roughly past Uniontown, Pennsylvania (not the current Uniontown), Cookport, and Diamondville to U.S. Highway 422. It followed the approximate present course of the highway west and NNW through Indiana to Shelocta. It crossed into Armstrong County near Elderton and ended at the village of Kittanning on the east bank of the Allegheny.

== History ==
The path was in use as early as 1721. In 1744 the English trader John Hart was granted a license by colonial authorities to trade with the Indians in western Pennsylvania lands, which were then closed to white settlement. Hart established a way station campsite, called Hart&#x27;s Sleeping Place, near the continental divide in Cambria County. The way station appeared on colonial maps and was used in 1752 by Gov. James Hamilton, and in 1754 by John Harris, the founder of Harrisburg. The last Native American encampment was recorded at the site in 1781.

In the 1750s the path became the raiding route taken by Lenape. Unhappy with a treaty that took away much of their land rights in western Pennsylvania, they raided white settlements in central Pennsylvania. In 1755, the Lenape chief Shingas used the trail to attack British settlements along the Juniata River, returning with captives to the village of Kittanning. In early August 1756, the Lenape used the path for a raid to burn Fort Granville near present-day Lewistown, when they also took prisoners. 

After the fort was burned, the British dispatched Lt. Colonel John Armstrong for retaliation. He pursued the Lenape along the path and camped at Canoe Place in early September; he continued to the village of Kittanning, which he destroyed on 8 September. Armstrong earned the accolade among British colonials as &quot;the Hero of Kittanning&quot; for the raid. He later served as a Major General for the United States in the American Revolutionary War and was elected to the Second Continental Congress.

The path was also traveled by early German pioneer Conrad Weiser, who was accompanied by William Franklin, the son of Benjamin Franklin. Weiser recorded the journey in his journal.

The Kittanning Path is not to be confused with the Kittanning Road, which was built by American rebel forces in 1779 during the Sullivan Expedition. The Kittanning Road followed a more northerly course, running from Kittanning to the site of what is now Olean, New York.

== Preservation ==
The trail has been surveyed by historians through Cambria County. An authentic section of the original trail is preserved near Eckenrode Mill east of Carrolltown.

<doc id="645687" wikidata="Q853266" url="?curid=645687" title="Beyond (band)">
<text>Beyond was a Hong Kong rock band formed in 1983. The band became prominent in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, mainland China, and Overseas Chinese communities. The band is widely considered as the most successful and influential Cantopop band from Hong Kong. In 1993, band frontman and major composer Wong Ka Kui died at the age of 31, after an accident during the filming of a gameshow at Fuji Television in Tokyo. Beyond continued to perform, record, and release music after Wong Ka Kui&#x27;s death. In 2005, the remaining members Paul Wong, Wong Ka Keung and Yip Sai Wing decided to pursue their own solo careers, and Beyond officially disbanded. They are one of the most-streamed Chinese groups on YouTube.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
In the early 1980s, lead vocalist Wong Ka Kui and drummer Yip Sai Wing started out as young musicians who were both interested in Pink Floyd&#x27;s progressive rock. Wong Ka Kui was notably influenced by western styles of rock, and the likes of David Bowie and King Crimson. In 1983, they decided to join a local music contest for &quot;Guitar Magazine&quot; and they decided to form a band with lead guitarist William Tang (鄧煒謙) and bassist Lee Wing Chiu (李榮潮). Tang wished the band&#x27;s name to convey a feeling of surpassing or going beyond themselves, so the name &quot;Beyond&quot; was chosen. However, the band name was not definite at the time. The band&#x27;s musical style was still experimental. At this time, Wong Ka Kui and Tai Chi lead guitarist Joey Tang formed a temporary band called NASA band that did art rock style of music with English pop.

In 1984, Wong&#x27;s younger brother Wong Ka Keung joined the band as a bassist. At the time, the band consisted of Wong Ka Kui, Yip Sai Wing, Wong Ka Keung and new lead guitarist Chan Sze On (陳時安). Chan soon had to leave for a foreign country, leaving the band without a lead guitarist. In 1985 Paul Wong, the band&#x27;s designer, joined the band to in his stead.

In the early years, time was difficult for the band. They had to do everything themselves, including organizing finance, selling tickets, and performing and buying their own equipment. The band&#x27;s first self-financed concert occurred in 1985 at Caritas Centre in Hong Kong. The show was unsuccessful but caught the attention of their first manager. He would help them raise HK$16,000, but the band was soon left with only HK$1000.

In 1986, the band rented a studio to record the album &quot;Goodbye My Dreams&quot; (再見理想). Lau Chi Yuen (劉志遠) then joined Beyond as lead guitarist and keyboardist. At the time Small Island, Tat Ming Pair and Beyond made a recording together. Small Island was scheduled to attend a July 1986 Pan-Asian Music Festival in Taipei, and Beyond was added to the schedule. Beyond was well-liked and they joined another festival that same year. They would sign with Kinn&#x27;s Music record company.

=== Commercial success ===
In 1987, Beyond produced the second album. The album &quot;Arabian Dancing Girls&quot; (阿拉伯跳舞女郎) was one of the band&#x27;s first commercial hits. They soon were in a new music underground trend along with a few number of bands, such as Tai Chi, Cocos and Raidas. Lau Chi Yuen left the band in 1988, leaving the band with four members only.

In 1989, Beyond became the first Hong Kong band to perform in Beijing at the Capital Indoor Stadium. Since Beyond&#x27;s songs were in Cantonese (instead of Mandarin), the performance was not well received by the audience. Before the stadium was filled, half the people had already left. However, they still considered the concert a success. After a couple of flops, Beyond started to gain popularity following the release of the hit song &quot;Great Land&quot; (大地). They would soon win their first musical awards, the 1988 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation and 1989 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards.

In 1990, they released one of their signature songs, &quot;Glorious Years&quot; (光輝歲月). The song was about racism and the struggle of Nelson Mandela in South Africa. The song was a huge hit, and had a fresh sound that stood out from the sea of love songs that dominated the Cantopop scene in Hong Kong. The song was from the band&#x27;s album &quot;Party of Fate&quot; (命運派對), which sold extremely well, achieving triple platinum. According to a later interview with Wong Ka-Keung, Mandela was &quot;deeply moved&quot; when he heard about the song during his final days in hospital.

In 1991, Beyond released another critically acclaimed song &quot;Amani&quot; from the album &quot;Hesitation&quot; (猶豫). The song was written during Beyond&#x27;s trip to Tanzania. As suggested by the title, which means &quot;peace&quot; in Swahili, the song is about the plight of war-ravaged Africa and the yearning for world peace. Part of the song&#x27;s lyrics were written in Swahili. The song is still often used by Hong Kong&#x27;s human rights bands to spread the message of peace.

In the same year, Beyond made their first appearance on Japan&#x27;s NHK station. They immediately signed with record company Amuse. Beyond started to become a more international band, and began to focus more time in Japan and Taiwan. The album &quot;Continue the Revolution&quot; (繼續革命) achieved commercial and critical success. In May 1993, Beyond released the album &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (樂與怒) which included the song &quot;Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies&quot; (海闊天空). That song would become Wong Ka Kui&#x27;s last song with the band.

=== Death of Wong Ka Kui ===

Beyond arrived in Japan in January 1993 to record new material and engage in media appearances. On 24 June 1993, the band appeared at a Tokyo Fuji Television game show &quot;If Uchannan-chan is Going to Do It, We Have to Do It!&quot; . The stage platform was 2.7 to 3m high. Actor Teruyoshi Uchimura and Wong Ka Kui both fell off a broken stage and sustained massive head injuries. Wong was sent to the Tokyo Women&#x27;s Medical University hospital. He fell into a coma and died 6 days later at aged 31.

The death occurred at the prime of the band&#x27;s career, with the tremendously successful song &quot;Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies&quot; released around the time. His funeral procession caused traffic in various major streets in Hong Kong to come to a standstill, and many top Hong Kong Cantopop singers of the time attended and paid tribute at the funeral. Criticisms followed that the Japanese were having too many late night shows of this type, and the TV station crews were overworked.

=== Post Ka Kui era ===
After the death of Wong, there was debate as to whether the remaining trio should continue to record and perform as Beyond. Eventually, they reappeared on 30 November 1993 in Hong Kong at the Composer&#x27;s Tribute Night concert. Beyond&#x27;s first album as a trio in that era was &quot;2nd Floor Back Suite&quot; (二樓後座), released on June 4, 1994. This album pays tribute towards the deceased Wong with &quot;Paradise&quot; by Paul, the instrumental &quot;We Don&#x27;t Wanna Make It Without You&quot; composed by the band, &quot;Scar&quot; and &quot;Wishing You Happiness&quot; by Steve. Aside from those, Steve also sang &quot;Wake Up&quot;, composed by the trio as well to express how Hong Kong fans are blindly supporting singers during their era which stirred up controversy. They have also written the sweet melody song &quot;There Is Always Love&quot; to their fans as a gift of appreciation for supporting them throughout the years.

A month later after &quot;2nd Floor Back Suite&quot; was released, the Mandarin version of the album was released titled &quot;Paradise&quot;. They have also released their third Japanese album under the title &quot;Second Floor&quot;, however rest of the track are the same as the Cantonese album with the exception being &quot;Paradise&quot; have been rewritten into Japanese.

In 1997 the album &quot;Please Let Go of Your Hands&quot; also made a reference to Hong Kong&#x27;s cultural changes after the handover of Hong Kong to China.

Throughout the trio era, their albums have a more alternative rock feel, unlike the progressive rock sound of previous albums which made some fans who have stuck around or came back after Wong&#x27;s death, praised the trios for their determination and dedication to hold up the band&#x27;s name that Wong have helped made reaching its popularity among the fans and Cantopop.

At this time, Paul Wong and Steve began to clash in many aspects of music production. Both musicians fought over the band&#x27;s future and artistic style whilst slowly drifting apart. This came to a head after Paul claimed that his pay should be higher than that of Yip Sai Wing, as he believed that he had contributed much more to the band&#x27;s composing and producing. The band had been splitting earnings equally since Wong Ka Kui had formed the band in 1983, and Steve believed that Paul&#x27;s claims to money were in direct violation of the band&#x27;s sense of equality which had made them so powerful to begin with. 

In November 1999, the three remaining Beyond members announced that they would pursue their own solo career after a world tour. In 2003 for the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary, they came out to embark on a world tour. The tour included stops in Toronto Canada, and various cities in mainland China.

In 2005, they played their last tour (The Story Live 2005) under the name Beyond and announced their disbandment at their last stop in Singapore.

For the first time in three years, the three remaining members of Beyond reunited to play &quot;Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies&quot; for the Wong Ka Kui Memorial Concert. The concert was organised by Wong Ka Keung as a birthday tribute to his brother 15 years after his death which featured covers of Ka Kui&#x27;s songs by bands and artists such as Kolor, Tai Chi, Soler and at17.

Yip Sai Wing and Paul Wong held a concert called &quot;Beyond Next Stage Live 2008&quot; on 11 Oct 2008 in Genting Highlands, Malaysia and later on 8 November 2008 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

In 2009, Wong Ka Keung and Paul Wong held a series of concerts called &quot;This is Rock &amp; Roll&quot; between 24 July and the 26th in Hong Kong.

== Legacy ==
The song &quot;Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies&quot; has been used in many charity events. For example, the song&#x27;s lyrics was modified and used for the massive Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

The original lyrics of the song &quot;Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies&quot; epitomizes the untamed pursuit of ideals and freedom despite obstacles. The song is widely sung by the protesters in the 2014 Hong Kong protests, which aim to fight for the implementation of universal suffrage in accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law and Sino-British Joint Declaration.

The song &quot;Glorious Years&quot; () is also used as the theme song for Hong Kong&#x27;s political activities. For example, the song was used for Hong Kong&#x27;s Five Constituencies Referendum where the pan-democrats tried to push for a by-election.

<text>Jatia is a locality in the city of Guwahati. It is speculated to be the ancient capital of Assam, known under the name of Pragjyotishpura. The locality is a suburb of Guwahati, though it is claimed that the name Jatia itself is the remnant of archaic name pragjyotisa.

Famous residents of Jatia include late Padum Barua (maker of the Assamese realist film &quot;Ganga Silonir Pakhi&quot;), Kanak Sen Deka (editor of the Assamese Newspaper &quot;Agradoot&quot;), Ratna Singha (First Manipuri woman Superintendent of Police)

<text>Arthur Oncken Lovejoy (October 10, 1873 – December 30, 1962) was an American philosopher and intellectual historian, who founded the discipline known as the history of ideas with his book &quot;The Great Chain of Being&quot; (1936), on the topic of that name, which is regarded as &#x27;probably the single most influential work in the history of ideas in the United States during the last half century&#x27;. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1932. In 1940, he founded the Journal of the History of Ideas.

==Life==
Lovejoy was born in Berlin, Germany, while his father was doing medical research there. Eighteen months later, his mother, a daughter of Johann Gerhard Oncken, committed suicide, whereupon his father gave up medicine and became a clergyman. Lovejoy studied philosophy, first at the University of California at Berkeley, then at Harvard under William James and Josiah Royce. He did not earn a Ph.D. In 1901, he resigned from his first job, at Stanford University, to protest the dismissal of a colleague who had offended a trustee. The President of Harvard then vetoed hiring Lovejoy on the grounds that he was a known troublemaker. Over the subsequent decade, he taught at Washington University in St. Louis, Columbia University, and the University of Missouri.

As a professor of philosophy at Johns Hopkins University from 1910 to 1938, Lovejoy founded and long presided over that university&#x27;s History of Ideas Club, where many prominent and budding intellectual and social historians, as well as literary critics, gathered. In 1940 he co-founded the &quot;Journal of the History of Ideas&quot; with Philip P. Wiener. Lovejoy insisted that the history of ideas should focus on &quot;unit ideas,&quot; single concepts (namely simple concepts sharing an abstract name with other concepts that were to be conceptually distinguished).

Lovejoy was active in the public arena. He helped found the American Association of University Professors and the Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. However, he qualified his belief in civil liberties to exclude what he considered threats to a free system. Thus, at the height of the McCarthy Era (in the February 14, 1952, edition of the &quot;Journal of Philosophy&quot;) Lovejoy stated that, since it was a &quot;matter of empirical fact&quot; that membership in the Communist Party contributed &quot;to the triumph of a world-wide organization&quot; which was opposed to &quot;freedom of inquiry, of opinion and of teaching,&quot; membership in the party constituted grounds for dismissal from academic positions. He also published numerous opinion pieces in the Baltimore press. He died in Baltimore on December 30, 1962.

==Philosophy==
In the domain of epistemology, Lovejoy is remembered for an influential critique of the pragmatic movement, especially in the essay &quot;The Thirteen Pragmatisms&quot;, written in 1908. Abstract nouns like &#x27;pragmatism&#x27; &#x27;idealism&#x27;, &#x27;rationalism&#x27; and the like were, in Lovejoy&#x27;s view, constituted by distinct, analytically separate ideas, which the historian of the genealogy of ideas had to thresh out, and show how the basic unit ideas combine and recombine with each other over time. The idea has, according to Simo Knuuttila, exercised a greater attraction on literary critics than on philosophers. Lovejoy was also an opponent of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. In 1930, he published a paper criticizing Einstein&#x27;s relativistic concept of simultaneity as arbitrary.

==Legacy==
William F. Bynum, looking back at Lovejoy&#x27;s &quot;Great Chain of Being&quot; after 40 years, describes it as &quot;a familiar feature of the intellectual landscape&quot;, indicating its great influence and &quot;brisk&quot; ongoing sales. Bynum argues that much more research is needed into how the concept of the great chain of being was replaced, but he agrees that Lovejoy was right that the crucial period was the end of the 18th century when &quot;the Enlightenment&#x27;s chain of being was dismantled&quot;.

<doc id="645707" wikidata="Q2600949" url="?curid=645707" title="Phlox (Star Trek)">
<text>Phlox is a fictional character, played by John Billingsley, in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. Set in the 22nd century in the science fiction &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, he is the physician aboard the first human Warp 5 capable starship, &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01), commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer. Phlox first appears in the premiere episode, &quot;Broken Bow&quot; (2001), marking the franchise&#x27;s introduction of the Denobulan race.

==Overview==
Phlox, a Denobulan, was on Earth as part of the Interspecies Medical Exchange when he was called to serve aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. As part of the Exchange, he regularly corresponds with Dr. Lucas, his human counterpart on his home planet of Denobula Triaxa.

Phlox has five children by his three wives: two daughters, both of whom also work in the medical field; and three sons, one of whom is an artist, while the youngest, Metus, is estranged from him (Phlox attempts to reconcile with him at the end of episode 21, season 2).

Phlox is portrayed as having an open mind to other species and cultures—even the Antarans, a race that once warred with the Denobulans. He is extremely frank about romantic and sexual matters, often to other crew members&#x27; embarrassment, and sometimes plays the role of matchmaker. He has an interest in natural remedies, and his sickbay contains an interplanetary menagerie, some of which are food for other animals that are sources for medical drugs.

Phlox is curious with a wry sense of humor. He has an affinity for Earth cuisine, particularly egg drop soup and other Chinese food. He is also interested in religion: he once prayed with a group of monks who visited &quot;Enterprise&quot;, spent a week with monks at a Tibetan monastery, attended Mass at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome and observed the Tal-Shanar ritual at the Vulcan compound in Sausalito.

Phlox&#x27;s physical abilities were revealed gradually during the franchise. He appears to need little sleep, instead embarking on an annual &quot;hibernation&quot; that lasts for six days. He also has great control over his facial muscles, being able to open his mouth wider than humans, as demonstrated by the impossibly large grin he occasionally sports (&quot;Broken Bow&quot;, &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; and &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;). When threatened, he has the ability to inflate his head like a blowfish to scare off attackers (&quot;Home&quot;).

== Sexuality ==
Phlox, as a Denobulan, is an early example of a LGBTQ+ in pre-&quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; Star Trek. According to Denobulan custom, Phlox has three wives, each of whom has two other husbands. Only one of his wives, Feezal, was seen on the show. In particular, his character as being polyamourous has been noted in commentary. Billingsly himself has referred to the character as the first polyamourous Star Trek character, and has also referred to Phlox as the first gay character in the show. 

== Reception ==
Media website &quot;The Digital Fix&quot; said that Billingsley delivered a &quot;consistently charming performance&quot;, and that he convincingly portrayed Phlox as a doctor, including his ability to transition &quot;from a reassuring bedside manner to one of sombre gravitas&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, in a review of important show characters, noted him as &quot;funny, quirky Phlox&quot;, and recommended the episodes &quot;Dear Doctor&quot;, &quot;Stigma&quot;, &quot;The Breach&quot; and &quot;Doctor’s Orders&quot; as his best appearances.

In 2016, &quot;SyFy&quot; ranked Phlox #1 of the six main-cast space doctors in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, citing his good bedside manner, relaxing demeanor, and success in curing patients, including those partially Borged.

In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; ranked Phlox 27th out of 39 main-cast &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise characters, prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.
Witney Seibold, writing for Slashfilm, referred to him as &quot;Trek&quot;&#x27;s greatest character, describing his sense of humour and Billingsley&#x27;s accomplished portrayal.

== Possible return of Phlox ==
With the popularity of the character amongst fans, it had initially been broached to Billingsley about returning to Live Star Trek. Initially in 2021, he had indicated he had been reluctant to return to the role, partially because of the time needed in makeup playing an alien character with prosthetics.

However, as time has gone by, with the question raised consistently, about Enterprise returning has indicated he is willing to return to the character.

Both Phlox and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; are popular with fans who want to see the show return. However while bringing the show back has challenges, there has been interest in bringing the character itself back into current shows, in particular &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;. This is made possible because his race, the Denobulans, are very long lived, living to be 300 years or more, and he would still be alive in those timelines. Billingsley revealed the &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; creative team in 2023 had enquired with him about the lifespan of his character, which he considered may be them trying to work Phlox into the cast of &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;. He said he himself has also spoken to writers for &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; and pitched ideas for the character&#x27;s return
