<text>In mathematics, a Euclidean group is the group of (Euclidean) isometries of a Euclidean space formula_1; that is, the transformations of that space that preserve the Euclidean distance between any two points (also called Euclidean transformations). The group depends only on the dimension &quot;n&quot; of the space, and is commonly denoted E(&quot;n&quot;) or ISO(&quot;n&quot;), for &quot;inhomogeneous special orthogonal&quot; group.

The Euclidean group E(&quot;n&quot;) comprises all translations, rotations, and reflections of formula_1; and arbitrary finite combinations of them. The Euclidean group can be seen as the symmetry group of the space itself, and contains the group of symmetries of any figure (subset) of that space.

A Euclidean isometry can be &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot;, depending on whether it preserves the handedness of figures. The direct Euclidean isometries form a subgroup, the special Euclidean group, often denoted SE(&quot;n&quot;) and E+(&quot;n&quot;), whose elements are called rigid motions or Euclidean motions. They comprise arbitrary combinations of translations and rotations, but not reflections.

These groups are among the oldest and most studied, at least in the cases of dimension 2 and 3 – implicitly, long before the concept of group was invented.

==Overview==

===Dimensionality===

The number of degrees of freedom for E(&quot;n&quot;) is , which gives 3 in case , and 6 for . Of these, &quot;n&quot; can be attributed to available translational symmetry, and the remaining to rotational symmetry.

===Direct and indirect isometries===
The direct isometries (i.e., isometries preserving the handedness of chiral subsets) comprise a subgroup of E(&quot;n&quot;), called the special Euclidean group and usually denoted by E+(&quot;n&quot;) or SE(&quot;n&quot;). They include the translations and rotations, and combinations thereof; including the identity transformation, but excluding any reflections.

The isometries that reverse handedness are called indirect, or opposite. For any fixed indirect isometry &quot;R&quot;, such as a reflection about some hyperplane, every other indirect isometry can be obtained by the composition of &quot;R&quot; with some direct isometry. Therefore, the indirect isometries are a coset of E+(&quot;n&quot;), which can be denoted by E−(&quot;n&quot;). It follows that the subgroup E+(&quot;n&quot;) is of index 2 in E(&quot;n&quot;).

===Topology of the group===
The natural topology of Euclidean space formula_1 implies a topology for the Euclidean group E(&quot;n&quot;). Namely, a sequence &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; of isometries of formula_1 (formula_5) is defined to converge if and only if, for any point &quot;p&quot; of formula_1, the sequence of points &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; converges.

From this definition it follows that a function formula_7 is continuous if and only if, for any point &quot;p&quot; of formula_1, the function formula_9 defined by &quot;f&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;))(&quot;p&quot;) is continuous. Such a function is called a &quot;continuous trajectory&quot; in E(&quot;n&quot;).

It turns out that the special Euclidean group SE(&quot;n&quot;) = E+(&quot;n&quot;) is connected in this topology. That is, given any two direct isometries &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of formula_1, there is a continuous trajectory &quot;f&quot; in E+(&quot;n&quot;) such that &quot;f&quot;(0) = &quot;A&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(1) = &quot;B&quot;. The same is true for the indirect isometries E−(&quot;n&quot;). On the other hand, the group E(&quot;n&quot;) as a whole is not connected: there is no continuous trajectory that starts in E+(&quot;n&quot;) and ends in E−(&quot;n&quot;).

The continuous trajectories in E(3) play an important role in classical mechanics, because they describe the physically possible movements of a rigid body in three-dimensional space over time. One takes &quot;f&quot;(0) to be the identity transformation &quot;I&quot; of formula_11, which describes the initial position of the body. The position and orientation of the body at any later time &quot;t&quot; will be described by the transformation &quot;f&quot;(t). Since &quot;f&quot;(0) = &quot;I&quot; is in E+(3), the same must be true of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) for any later time. For that reason, the direct Euclidean isometries are also called &quot;rigid motions&quot;.

===Lie structure===

The Euclidean groups are not only topological groups, they are Lie groups, so that calculus notions can be adapted immediately to this setting.

===Relation to the affine group===
The Euclidean group E(&quot;n&quot;) is a subgroup of the affine group for &quot;n&quot; dimensions. Both groups have a structure as a semidirect product of the group of Euclidean translations with a group of origin-preserving transformations, and this product structure is respected by the inclusion of the Euclidean group in the affine group. This gives, &quot;a fortiori&quot;, two ways of writing elements in an explicit notation. These are:

# by a pair , with &quot;A&quot; an orthogonal matrix, and &quot;b&quot; a real column vector of size &quot;n&quot;; or
# by a single square matrix of size , as explained for the affine group.

Details for the first representation are given in the next section.

In the terms of Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme, we read off from this that Euclidean geometry, the geometry of the Euclidean group of symmetries, is, therefore, a specialisation of affine geometry. All affine theorems apply. The origin of Euclidean geometry allows definition of the notion of distance, from which angle can then be deduced.

==Detailed discussion==

===Subgroup structure, matrix and vector representation===
The Euclidean group is a subgroup of the group of affine transformations.

It has as subgroups the translational group T(&quot;n&quot;), and the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;). Any element of E(&quot;n&quot;) is a translation followed by an orthogonal transformation (the linear part of the isometry), in a unique way: formula_12 where &quot;A&quot; is an orthogonal matrix

or the same orthogonal transformation followed by a translation: formula_13 with 

T(&quot;n&quot;) is a normal subgroup of E(&quot;n&quot;): for every translation &quot;t&quot; and every isometry &quot;u&quot;, the composition formula_14 is again a translation.

Together, these facts imply that E(&quot;n&quot;) is the semidirect product of O(&quot;n&quot;) extended by T(&quot;n&quot;), which is written as formula_15. In other words, O(&quot;n&quot;) is (in the natural way) also the quotient group of E(&quot;n&quot;) by T(&quot;n&quot;): formula_16

Now SO(&quot;n&quot;), the special orthogonal group, is a subgroup of O(&quot;n&quot;) of index two. Therefore, E(&quot;n&quot;) has a subgroup E+(&quot;n&quot;), also of index two, consisting of &quot;direct&quot; isometries. In these cases the determinant of &quot;A&quot; is 1.

They are represented as a translation followed by a rotation, rather than a translation followed by some kind of reflection (in dimensions 2 and 3, these are the familiar reflections in a mirror line or plane, which may be taken to include the origin, or in 3D, a rotoreflection).

This relation is commonly written as: formula_17
or, equivalently: formula_18

===Subgroups===
Types of subgroups of E(&quot;n&quot;):
;Finite groups.:They always have a fixed point. In 3D, for every point there are for every orientation two which are maximal (with respect to inclusion) among the finite groups: O&quot;h&quot; and I&quot;h&quot;. The groups I&quot;h&quot; are even maximal among the groups including the next category.
;Countably infinite groups without arbitrarily small translations, rotations, or combinations: i.e., for every point the set of images under the isometries is topologically discrete (e.g., for a group generated by &quot;m&quot; translations in independent directions, and possibly a finite point group). This includes lattices. Examples more general than those are the discrete space groups.
;Countably infinite groups with arbitrarily small translations, rotations, or combinations: In this case there are points for which the set of images under the isometries is not closed. Examples of such groups are, in 1D, the group generated by a translation of 1 and one of , and, in 2D, the group generated by a rotation about the origin by 1 radian.
;Non-countable groups, where there are points for which the set of images under the isometries is not closed: (e.g., in 2D all translations in one direction, and all translations by rational distances in another direction).
;Non-countable groups, where for all points the set of images under the isometries is closed: e.g.:
:*all direct isometries that keep the origin fixed, or more generally, some point (in 3D called the rotation group)
:*all isometries that keep the origin fixed, or more generally, some point (the orthogonal group)
:*all direct isometries E+(&quot;n&quot;)
:*the whole Euclidean group E(&quot;n&quot;)
:*one of these groups in an &quot;m&quot;-dimensional subspace combined with a discrete group of isometries in the orthogonal (&quot;n&quot;−&quot;m&quot;)-dimensional space
:*one of these groups in an &quot;m&quot;-dimensional subspace combined with another one in the orthogonal (&quot;n&quot;−&quot;m&quot;)-dimensional space

Examples in 3D of combinations:
*all rotations about one fixed axis
*ditto combined with reflection in planes through the axis and/or a plane perpendicular to the axis
*ditto combined with discrete translation along the axis or with all isometries along the axis
*a discrete point group, frieze group, or wallpaper group in a plane, combined with any symmetry group in the perpendicular direction
*all isometries which are a combination of a rotation about some axis and a proportional translation along the axis; in general this is combined with &quot;k&quot;-fold rotational isometries about the same axis (); the set of images of a point under the isometries is a &quot;k&quot;-fold helix; in addition there may be a 2-fold rotation about a perpendicularly intersecting axis, and hence a &quot;k&quot;-fold helix of such axes.
*for any point group: the group of all isometries which are a combination of an isometry in the point group and a translation; for example, in the case of the group generated by inversion in the origin: the group of all translations and inversion in all points; this is the generalized dihedral group of R3, Dih(R3).

===Overview of isometries in up to three dimensions=== 
E(1), E(2), and E(3) can be categorized as follows, with degrees of freedom:



Chasles&#x27; theorem asserts that any element of E+(3) is a screw displacement.

See also 3D isometries that leave the origin fixed, space group, involution.

===Commuting isometries===
For some isometry pairs composition does not depend on order:
*two translations
*two rotations or screws about the same axis
*reflection with respect to a plane, and a translation in that plane, a rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane, or a reflection with respect to a perpendicular plane
*glide reflection with respect to a plane, and a translation in that plane
*inversion in a point and any isometry keeping the point fixed
*rotation by 180° about an axis and reflection in a plane through that axis
*rotation by 180° about an axis and rotation by 180° about a perpendicular axis (results in rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to both)
*two rotoreflections about the same axis, with respect to the same plane
*two glide reflections with respect to the same plane

===Conjugacy classes===
The translations by a given distance in any direction form a conjugacy class; the translation group is the union of those for all distances.

In 1D, all reflections are in the same class.

In 2D, rotations by the same angle in either direction are in the same class. Glide reflections with translation by the same distance are in the same class.

In 3D:
*Inversions with respect to all points are in the same class.
*Rotations by the same angle are in the same class.
*Rotations about an axis combined with translation along that axis are in the same class if the angle is the same and the translation distance is the same.
*Reflections in a plane are in the same class
*Reflections in a plane combined with translation in that plane by the same distance are in the same class.
*Rotations about an axis by the same angle not equal to 180°, combined with reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis, are in the same class.

<doc id="652165" wikidata="Q2933843" url="?curid=652165" title="Mesoamerican calendars">
<text>The calendrical systems devised and used by the pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica, primarily a 260-day year, were used in religious observances and social rituals, such as divination.

These calendars have been dated to early as ca. 1100 BCE. By 500 BCE at the latest, the essentials were fully defined and functional. 260-day calendars are still used in the Guatemalan highlands, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico.

The importance of aboriginal calendars in ritual and other aspects of Mesoamerican life was noted by many missionary priests, travelers, and colonial administrators, and later by ethnographers who described and recorded the cultures of contemporary Mesoamerican ethnic groups.

==Types of calendars==
Among the various calendar systems in use, two were particularly central and widespread across Mesoamerica. Common to all recorded Mesoamerican cultures, and the most important, was the 260-day calendar, a ritual calendar with no confirmed correlation to astronomical or agricultural cycles. Apparently the earliest Mesoamerican calendar to be developed was known by a variety of local terms, and its named components and the glyphs used to depict them were culture-specific. However, it is clear that type of calendar functioned in essentially the same way across cultures, and across the chronological periods when it was maintained.

The second of the major calendars was one representing a 365-day period approximating the tropical year, known sometimes as the &quot;vague year&quot;. Because it was an approximation, over time the seasons and the true tropical year gradually &quot;wandered&quot; with respect to this calendar, owing to the accumulation of the differences in length. There is little hard evidence to suggest that the ancient Mesoamericans used any intercalary days to bring their calendar back into alignment. However, there is evidence to show Mesoamericans were aware of this gradual shifting, which they accounted for in other ways without amending the calendar itself.

These two 260- and 365-day calendars could also be synchronised to generate the Calendar Round, a period of 18980 days or approximately 52 years. The completion and observance of this Calendar Round sequence was of ritual significance to a number of Mesoamerican cultures.

A third major calendar form known as the Long Count is found in the inscriptions of several Mesoamerican cultures, most famously those of the Maya civilization who developed it to its fullest extent during the Classic period (ca. 200–900 CE). The Long Count provided the ability to uniquely identify days over a much longer period of time, by combining a sequence of day-counts or cycles of increasing length, calculated or set from a particular date in the mythical past. Most commonly, five such higher-order cycles in a modified vigesimal (base-20) count were used.

The use of Mesoamerican calendrics is one of the cultural traits that Paul Kirchhoff used in his original formulation to define Mesoamerica as a culture area. Therefore, the use of Mesoamerican calendars is specific to Mesoamerica and is not found outside its boundaries.

Since the sixteenth century, most communities have lost both of these once universal calendars, but one—or, rarely, both—has survived in diverse linguistic groups through the twentieth century.

==Ritual 260-day calendar==

In the 260-day cycle 20 day names pairs with 13 day numbers, totaling a cycle of 260 days. This cycle was used for divination purposes to foretell lucky and unlucky days. The date of birth was also used to give names to both humans and gods in many Mesoamerican cultures; some cultures used only the calendar name whereas others combined it with a given name. As a result, the word for “day” also means “name” in some Mesoamerican languages. Each day sign was presided over by a god and many had associations with specific natural phenomena..

===History===
Earliest written evidence for the 260 calendar include the San Andres glyphs (Olmec, 650 BCE, giving the possible date 3 Ajaw) and the San Jose Mogote danzante (Zapotec, 600 - 500 BCE, giving the possible date 1 Earthquake), in both cases assumed to be used as names. However, the earliest evidence of the use of the 260-day cycle comes from astronomical alignments in the Olmec region and western Maya Lowlands, dating to about 1100 BCE.

The exact origin of the 260-day count is not known, but there are several theories. One theory is that the calendar came from mathematical operations based on the numbers thirteen and twenty, which were important numbers to the Maya. The numbers multiplied together equal 260.

Another theory is that the 260-day period came from the length of human pregnancy. This is close to the average number of days between the &quot;first missed&quot; menstrual period and birth, unlike Naegele&#x27;s rule which is 40 weeks (280 days) between the &quot;last&quot; menstrual period and birth. It is postulated that midwives originally developed the calendar to predict babies&#x27; expected birth dates.

A third theory comes from understanding of astronomy, geography and paleontology. The Mesoamerican calendar probably originated with the Olmecs, and a settlement existed at Izapa, in southeast Chiapas, Mexico, before 1200 BCE. There, at a latitude of about 15° N, the Sun passes through zenith twice a year, and there are 260 days between zenithal passages, and gnomons (used generally for observing the path of the Sun and in particular zenithal passages), were found at this and other sites. The sacred almanac may well have been set in motion on August 13, 1359, BCE, in Izapa. 

===&quot;Trecenas&quot;===
In the post-classic Aztec calendar the periods of 13 days called a &quot;trecena&quot; in Spanish (no indigenous word for this period is known) were also important. The days of a &quot;trecena&quot; were usually numbered from 1 to 13. There were some exceptions, such as in the Tlapanec area where they were counted from 2 to 14. The first day of the &quot;trecena&quot;, and the god who was its patron, ruled the following thirteen days. If the first day of a trecena was auspicious then so were the next twelve days.

==365-day calendar==
This 365-day calendar corresponded was divided into 18 &#x27;months&#x27; of 20 days each, plus 5 &#x27;nameless&#x27; days at the end of the year. The 365 day year had no leap year so it varied from the solar year by a quarter of a day each year.

The years were given their name in much the same way as the days of the 260-day calendar, 20 names were paired with 18 numbers giving 360 different possibilities for year names

===&quot;Veintenas&quot;===
In the post-classic Aztec calendar the 20 days called &quot;veintenas&quot; in Spanish and &quot;meztli&quot;, meaning moon, in Nahuatl, were also important.

===The five unlucky days===
The five unlucky days were called &quot;nemontemi&quot; in Mexico. Most believe them to have come at the end of each year, but since we do not know when the year started, we cannot know for sure. We do know though, that in the Maya area these five days (called &quot;wayeb&quot; in Maya) were always the last days of the year.

The &quot;nemontemi&quot; were seen as &#x27;the useless days&#x27; or the days that were dedicated to no gods, and they had prognostic power for the coming year. Therefore, People tried to do as little as possible on these days, and a person who was born during the &quot;nemontemi&quot; was considered unlucky.

==Calendar Round==
Since both the 260-day and the 365-day calendar repeat, approximately every 52 years they reach a common end, and a new Calendar Round begins. This 52-year cycle was the most important for most Mesoamericans, with the apparent exception of the Maya elite until the end of the Classic Era, who gave equal importance to the long count calendar.
According to their mythology, at the end of one of these 52-year cycles the world would be destroyed by the gods, as it had been, three times in the Popul Vuh and four times for the Aztecs. While waiting for this to happen, all fire was extinguished, utensils were destroyed to symbolize new beginnings, people fasted and rituals were carried out. This was known as the New Fire Ceremony. When dawn broke on the first day of the new cycle, torches were lit in the temples and brought out to light new fires everywhere, and ceremonies of thanksgiving were performed.

==Calendar Wheels==
The term calendar wheel generally refers to Colonial-period images that display cycles of time in a circular format. Central Mexican calendar wheels incorporate the eighteen annual festivals or the 52-year cycle. In the Maya area, calendar wheels depict a cycle of 13 K&#x27;atuns. The only known pre-Hispanic K&#x27;atuns wheel appears on a stone turtle from Mayapán.

The earliest known Colonial-period calendar wheel is actually depicted in a square format, on pages 21 and 22 of the Codex Borbonicus, an Aztec screenfold that divides the 52-year cycle into two parts. The Codex Aubin, also known as the Codex of 1576, shows the 52-year calendar in a rectangular format on a single page. Most other calendar wheels use a circular format. The Boban calendar wheel, an early sixteenth-century calendar on native paper, depicts the Central Mexican cycle of eighteen festivals in clockwise rotation, with Arabic numerals used to total the number of days; virtually all the text is in Nahuatl. Some paired festivals share the same glyph, but they are represented in different sizes, the first being the “small feast” and the second the “great feast.” In the center, a 7 Rabbit date (1538) appears with text and images that refer to Tetzcocan town officers.

==Religion and calendrics==
===Lords of the day===
In the post-classic Aztec calendar, there were 13 Lords of the Day. These were gods (and goddesses) who each represented one of the 13 days in the &quot;trecenas&quot; of the 260-day calendar. The same god always represented the same day. Quetzalcohuatl (The feathered serpent), for example, always accompanied the 9th day.

===Lords of the Night===

There are only nine Lords of the Night, which means that they cannot always represent the same day, but the list of gods repeats itself again and again so each lord accompanies a new number each &quot;trecena&quot;.
Some think that there are nine Lords of the Night because they are connected to the nine levels of the underworld.

==Long Count==


The 365-day and the 260-day calendars identified and named the days, but not the years. The combination of a solar year date and a 260-year date was enough to identify a specific date to most people&#x27;s satisfaction, as such a combination did not occur again for another 52 years, above general life expectancy. To measure dates over periods longer than 52 years, the Mesoamericans devised the Long Count calendar. This calendar system was probably developed by the Olmecs and later adopted by the Maya. The use of the long count is best attested among the classic Maya, it is not known to have been used by the central Mexican cultures.

The Long Count calendar identifies a date by counting the number of days from August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6, 3114 BCE in the Julian Calendar (-3113 astronomical). The Long Count days were tallied in a modified base-20 scheme. Thus 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25, and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40.

==Correlations==
===Long count===
The correlation is based on historical, archaeological and astronomical evidence.

The commonly established way of expressing the correlation between the Maya calendar and the western calendars is to provide number of days from the start of the Julian Period (Monday, January 1, 4713 BCE) to the start of creation on 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ajaw, 8 Kumk&#x27;u.

The most commonly accepted correlation is the &quot;Goodman, Martinez, Thompson&quot; correlation (GMT correlation). The GMT correlation establishes that the creation date occurred on September 6 (Julian) or August 11 (Gregorian), 3114 BC (-3113 astronomical), Julian day number (JDN) 584283.

==Maya Calendar==

The Maya version of the 260-day calendar is commonly known to scholars as the &quot;Tzolkin&quot;, or &quot;Tzolk&#x27;in&quot; in the revised orthography of the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala. The Tzolk&#x27;in is combined with the 365-day calendar (known as the &quot;Haab&quot;, or &quot;Haab&quot;&#x27; ), to form a synchronized cycle lasting for 52 Haabs, called the &quot;Calendar Round&quot;. The Maya called the 5 unlucky days at the end of the year &quot;Wayeb&quot;.

The Classic Maya, used the Long Count to record dates within periods longer than the 52 year calendar round. The post-Classic Maya used an abbreviated short count. Many Maya Long Count inscriptions also have a supplementary series which can record which one of the nine Lords of the Night rules, a Lunar series which has information about the lunar cycle, such as lunar phase and position of the Moon in a six lunation cycle and length of the current lunation and an 819-day count.

==Central Mexican Calendar==
The Central Mexican calendar system is best known in the form that was used by the Aztecs, but similar calendars were used by the Mixtecs, Zapotecs, Tlapanecs, Otomi, Matlatzinca, Totonac, Huastecs, Purépecha and at Teotihuacan. These calendars differed from the Maya version mainly in that they didn&#x27;t use the long count to fix dates into a larger chronological frame than the 52-year cycle.

The Aztecs referred to the 365 and 260-day cycles as &quot;xiuhpohualli&quot; (year count) and &quot;tonalpohualli&quot; (day count) respectively. The &quot;veintena&quot; was called &quot;metztli&quot; (moon), and the five unlucky days at the end of the solar year were called &quot;nemontemi&quot;.

==Other cycles==
Other calendar cycles were also recorded, such as a lunar calendar, as well as the cycles of other astronomical objects, most importantly Venus.

<doc id="652169" wikidata="Q2739991" url="?curid=652169" title="Northeast Philadelphia Airport">
<text>Northeast Philadelphia Airport is a public airport just north of the intersection of Grant Avenue and Ashton Road in Northeast Philadelphia. It is part of the Philadelphia Airport System along with Philadelphia International Airport and is the general aviation reliever airport for Philadelphia International. Northeast Philadelphia Airport is the sixth busiest airport in Pennsylvania. Two fixed-base operators provide fuel, major aircraft repair, hangar rental, aircraft rental and charter, flight instruction, and aircraft sales.

==Location==
This airport covers , bounded by Grant Avenue to the south, Academy Road to the east, Comly Road to the north, and the Roosevelt Boulevard (U.S. 1) to the west. (The airport does not extend all the way to these boundaries.) Development includes a Pepsi-Cola bottling plant, an industrial park with aviation-related businesses, the headquarters of the 1st and 8th Districts of the Philadelphia Police Department, and the former site of the Internal Revenue Service Philadelphia Service Center. A TJ Maxx distribution center and an ice skating rink opened in 2001 on land leased from the airport.

When the airport opened, the surrounding area was largely open farmland. Residential neighborhoods and businesses have since developed close to the airport, so pilots must observe noise abatement procedures.

==History==
Northeast Philadelphia Airport started in the 1930s as the Northeast Airport, a grass field with no paved runways, one of three small airports in the area. Just across Roosevelt Boulevard to the west, next to Red Lion Road, was Boulevard Airport, the most important of the three. Further west was Budd Field (built for Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Company, later as a golf course and other parts for housing) and Somerton Airport (near Bustleton Avenue and Red Lion Road), no longer in existence, close enough that pilots had to take care not to infringe on adjacent traffic patterns. The site of the Boulevard Airport is now a shopping mall (Red Lion Plaza) and housing. The Northeast Airport became today&#x27;s large airport.

The United States Army Air Corps began construction of a airbase in Northeast Philadelphia during World War II, but the project was never completed and the property was turned over to the city in 1944. After the city finished the work, Philadelphia Northeast Airport opened in June 1945. In 1948 the name was changed to North Philadelphia Airport.

The airport expanded in 1960 when Runway 6/24 was extended to its present length. Runway 10/28 was abandoned at this time due to construction on the western end of the runway. The name was changed again in 1980, to the present Northeast Philadelphia Airport.

The airport was the headquarters and maintenance facility for Ransome Airlines, which operated scheduled passenger flights as Allegheny Commuter to Washington D.C. via Reagan National Airport (DCA) and to nearby Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) as well as to other regional destinations beginning in September 1973 as a feeder for Allegheny Airlines. Ransome&#x27;s passenger operation from PNE was ended by the PATCO strike of 1981 which cut regional airline schedules by 25 percent; the airline operated independently for some time, fed Delta Air Lines flights in the early 1980s, and was later sold to Pan American World Airways and then to Trans World Airlines, ending its life as Trans World Express. PNE continued to be a maintenance base for TWE through the early 1990s. The base shut down in 1995, with a loss of 300 local jobs.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Northeast Philadelphia Airport covers at an elevation of 120 feet (37 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt runways: 6/24 is 7,000 by 100 feet (2,134 x 30 m) and 15/33 is 4,999 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m).

In the year ending December 7, 2022, the airport had 83,551 aircraft operations, average 229 per day: 94% general aviation, 5% air taxi and less than 1% military. 143 aircraft were then based at the airport: 90 single-engine, 28 multi-engine, 17 jet and 8 helicopter.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On Tuesday, October 7, 1952, a USAF Douglas C-47 crashed north of PNE attempting to land but impacted swampy terrain; the three-man flight crew was killed, but all three enlisted passengers survived the early morning crash.
*On Thursday, April 4, 1991, a Sunbell Aviation Helicopters Bell 412 collided in mid-air with a Piper Aerostar which was flying from Williamsport to Philadelphia International Airport. The Piper was carrying U.S. Senator John Heinz when it collided over Merion Elementary School in Lower Merion Township. All five aboard both aircraft and two children at the school were killed. Already airborne, the helicopter had offered to observe the status of the nose landing gear of the plane; while moving in for a closer look, its rotors struck the plane, causing both aircraft to lose control and crash shortly after noon. The subsequent NTSB investigation attributed the cause of the crash to poor judgment by the pilots of both aircraft.
*On Friday, January 31, 2025, a Learjet 55 departed PNE on runway 24 and crashed approximately southwest, near Roosevelt Mall. All six occupants of Med Jets Flight 056 and one person on the ground (in a vehicle) were killed in the early evening crash, and several patrons at the nearby mall were injured.

<doc id="652176" wikidata="Q516375" url="?curid=652176" title="Alain de Benoist">
<text>Alain de Benoist ( ; ; born 11 December 1943), also known as Fabrice Laroche, Robert de Herte, David Barney, and other pen names, is a French political philosopher and journalist, a founding member of the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; (France&#x27;s New Right), and the leader of the ethno-nationalist think tank GRECE.

Principally influenced by thinkers of the German Conservative Revolution, de Benoist is opposed to Christianity, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, neoliberalism, representative democracy, egalitarianism, and what he sees as embodying and promoting those values, namely the United States. He theorized the notion of ethnopluralism, a concept which relies on preserving and mutually respecting individual and bordered ethno-cultural regions.

His work has been influential with the alt-right movement in the United States, and he presented a lecture on identity at a National Policy Institute conference hosted by Richard B. Spencer; however, he has distanced himself from the movement.

==Biography==

=== Family ===

Alain de Benoist was born on 11 December 1943 in Saint-Symphorien (now part of Tours), Centre-Val de Loire, the son of a head of sales at Guerlain, also named Alain de Benoist, and Germaine de Benoist, née Langouët. He grew up in a bourgeois and Catholic family. His mother came from the lower-middle class of Normandy and Brittany, and his father belonged to the Belgian nobility.

During the Second World War, his father was a member of the French resistance armed group French Forces of the Interior. He was a self-declared Gaullist, whereas his wife Germaine was rather left-leaning, and the extended de Benoist family was divided between Free France and Vichy France during the conflict. His paternal grandmother, Yvonnes de Benoist, was the secretary of Gustave Le Bon. De Benoist is also the great-nephew of French Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau.

=== Early life (1957–1961) ===
De Benoist was still in high school at Montaigne and Louis-le-Grand lycées during the turmoils of the Algerian war (1954–1962), a period that shaped his political views. In 1957, he met the daughter of the antisemitic journalist and conspiracy theorist Henry Coston. From the age of 15, de Benoist became interested in the nationalist right; he started a career as a journalist in 1960 by writing literary pieces and pamphlets for Coston&#x27;s magazine &quot;Lectures Françaises&quot;, generally in defence of the French colonial empire and the pro-colonial paramilitary organization Organisation Armée Secrète (OAS). De Benoist stayed away from Coston’s conspiracy theories on the Freemasonry and the Jews.
Aged 17 in 1961, de Benoist met François d&#x27;Orcival, with whom he became the editor of &quot;France Information&quot;, an underground pro-OAS newspaper. The same year, he started to attend the University of Paris and joined the far-right student society Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN). In 1962, he became the secretary of the group&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Cahiers universitaires&quot;, in which he wrote the main articles along with d&#x27;Orcival. As a student in law and literature, he began a period of political activism and developed a passion for fantastique cinema. According to philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff, de Benoist possessed an intellectual curiosity that was lacking among his elder colleagues like Dominique Venner (1935–2013) or Jean Mabire (1927–2006), and the young journalist led them to discover a conceptual universe &quot;that they could not imagine&quot;, no more than its &quot;possible ideological exploitations&quot;.

=== Radical political activism (1962–1967) ===
De Benoist met Dominique Venner in 1962. The following year, he took part in the creation of &quot;Europe-Action&quot;, a white nationalist magazine founded by Venner and in which de Benoist began to work as a journalist. He published at that times his first essays: &quot;Salan devant l&#x27;opinion&quot; (&quot;Salan faces the [public] opinion&quot;, 1963) and &quot;Le courage est leur patrie&quot; (&quot;Braveness is their motherland&quot;, 1965), defending French Algeria and the OAS.

Between 1963 and 1965, de Benoist was a member of the Rationalist Union; he probably began to read Louis Rougier&#x27;s criticism of Christianity during that period. De Benoist met Rougier, who was also a member of the organization, and his ideas deeply influenced de Benoist&#x27;s own anti-Christianity. In 1965, de Benoist wrote: &quot;We oppose Rougier to Sartre, as we oppose verbal delirium to logics ..., because biological realism is the best support against those idealistic chimeras&quot;. De Benoist became in 1964 the editor-in-chief of the weekly publication &quot;Europe-Action Hebdomaire&quot;, renamed &quot;L&#x27;Observateur Européen&quot; in October 1966. He also wrote in the neo-fascist magazine &quot;Défense de l&#x27;Occident&quot;, founded in 1952 by Maurice Bardèche.

After a visit to South Africa at the invitation of Hendrik Verwoerd&#x27;s National Party government, de Benoist co-wrote with Gilles Fournier the 1965 essay &quot;Vérité pour l&#x27;Afrique du Sud&quot; (&quot;Truth for South Africa&quot;), in which they endorsed apartheid. The following year, he co-wrote with D&#x27;Orcival another essay, &quot;Rhodésie, pays des lions fidèles&quot; (&quot;Rhodesia, country of the faithful lions&quot;), in defence of Rhodesia, a breakaway country in southern Africa ruled at that time by a white-minority government. Ian Smith, the then prime minister of the unrecognized state, prefaced the book. Returning from a trip to the United States in 1965, de Benoist deplored the suppression of racial segregation in the United States, and wrote as a prediction that the system would survive outside the law, thus in a more violent way.

In two essays published in 1966, &quot;Les Indo-Européens&quot; (&quot;The Indo-Europeans&quot;) and &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que le nationalisme?&quot; (&quot;What Is Nationalism?&quot;), de Benoist contributed to define a new form of European nationalism in which the European civilization — to be understood as the &quot;white race&quot; — would be considered above its constituting ethnic groups, all united within a common empire and civilization superseding the nation states. This agenda was adopted by the European Rally for Liberty (REL) during the 1967 French legislative election (de Benoist was a member of the REL national council), and later became a core idea of GRECE since its foundation in 1968.

The successive failures of the far-right movements de Benoist had supported since the early 1960s — from the dissolution of OAS and the Évian Accords of 1962, to the electoral defeat of presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour in 1965 (in which he had participated via the grassroots movement T.V. Committees), to the debacle of the REL in the March 1967 election — led de Benoist to question his political involvement. In the fall of 1967, he decided to make a &quot;permanent and complete break with political action&quot; and to focus on a meta-political strategy by launching a review. During the May 1968 events in France, then aged 25, de Benoist worked as a journalist for the professional magazine &quot;L&#x27;Écho de la presse et de la publicité&quot;.

===&quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; and media fame (1968–1993)===
The Groupement de Recherche et d&#x27;Études pour la Civilisation Européenne (GRECE) was founded in January 1968 in order to serve as a metapolitical, ethnonationalist think-tank promoting the ideas of the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;. Although the organization was established with former militants of the REL and FEN, de Benoist has been described by scholars as its leader and &quot;most authoritative spokesman&quot;. In the 1970s, de Benoist adapted his geopolitical view-points and went from a pro-colonial attitude towards an advocacy of Third-Worldism against capitalist America and communist Russia, from the defence of the &quot;last outposts of the West&quot; towards anti-Americanism, and from a biological to a cultural approach of the notion of alterity, an idea which he developed in his ethnopluralist theories.

De Benoist&#x27;s works, along with others published by the think tank, began to attract public attention in the late 1970s, when the media coined the term &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; to label the movement. He started to write articles for mainstream right-wing magazines, namely &quot;Valeurs Actuelles&quot; and &quot;Le Spectacle du Monde&quot; from 1970 to 1982, and &quot;Le Figaro Dimanche&quot; (renamed in 1978 &quot;Le Figaro Magazine&quot;) from 1977 to 1982; he then wrote for the videos section of &quot;Le Figaro Magazine&quot; until 1992. De Benoist was awarded in 1978 the prestigious Prix de l&#x27;essai by the Académie française for his book &quot;View for the Right&quot; (&quot;Vu de droite: Anthologie critique des idées contemporaines&quot;). Between 1980 and 1992, he was a regular participant in the radio program &quot;Panorama&quot; on France Culture.

Although de Benoist had announced his retirement from political parties and elections to focus on metapolitics in 1968, he ran as a candidate for the far-right Party of New Forces during the 1979 European Parliament election. In the 1984 European Parliament election in France, de Benoist announced his intention to vote for the French Communist Party, and justified his choice by describing the party as the most credible anti-capitalist, anti-liberal, and anti-American political force then active in France.

De Benoist met Russian writer Aleksandr Dugin in 1989 and the two of them soon became close collaborators. De Benoist was invited in Moscow by Dugin in 1992, and Dugin presented himself as the Moscow correspondent of GRECE for a time. De Benoist briefly served as a board member of Dugin&#x27;s magazine &quot;Elementy&quot; in 1992. The two authors eventually broke off their relationship in 1993 after a virulent campaign in French and German media against the &quot;red and brown threat&quot; in Russia. Whereas de Benoist acknowledged ideological differences with Dugin, especially on Eurasianism and Martin Heidegger, they have maintained regular exchanges since then.

=== Intellectual re-emergence (1994–present) ===
In 1979 and 1993, two press campaigns launched in French liberal media against de Benoist damaged his public reputation and influence in France by claiming that he was in reality a &quot;closet Fascist&quot; or a &quot;Nazi&quot;. The journalists accused de Benoist of hiding his racist and anti-egalitarian beliefs in a seemingly acceptable public agenda, replacing the doomed hierarchy of races with the less suspicious concept of ethno-pluralism. Although he still frequently comments on politics, de Benoist chose in the early 1990s to focus on his intellectual activity and to avoid media attention. Since the 2000s onward, public interest for de Benoist&#x27;s works have re-emerged. His writings have been published in several far-right journals, such as the &quot;Journal of Historical Review,&quot; &quot;Chronicles&quot;, the &quot;Occidental Quarterly&quot;, and &quot;Tyr,&quot; and the New Left academic journal &quot;Telos&quot;. De Benoist was one of the signatories of the 2002 &quot;Manifesto Against the Death of the Spirit and the Earth&quot;, reportedly because &quot;it seemed to [him] that it reacts against the practical materialism that is part of a dominant ideology, an ideology for which there is nothing beyond material concerns&quot;.
In a 2002 republication of his book &quot;View from the Right&quot;, de Benoist reiterated what he wrote in 1977 that the greatest danger in the world at that time was the &quot;progressive disappearance of diversity from the world&quot;, including biodiversity of animals, cultures and peoples. De Benoist is now the editor of two magazines: the yearly &quot;Nouvelle École&quot; (since 1968) and the quarterly &quot;Krisis&quot; (since 1988).

Although the extent of the relationship is debated by scholars, de Benoist and the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; are generally viewed as influential on the ideological and political structure of the Identitarian movement. Part of the alt-right has also claimed to have been inspired by de Benoist&#x27;s writings.

==Views==

In his early writings, de Benoist was close to pro-colonial movements and followed an ethno-biological approach of social science, endorsing apartheid as the &quot;last outpost of the West&quot; at a time of &quot;decolonization and international negrification&quot;. From the 1970s onward, he has gradually moved towards the defence of the Third World against American imperialism, and has adopted a cultural definition of &quot;difference&quot;, which is theorized in his concept of ethnopluralism. Scholars have questioned whether this evolution should be regarded as a sincere ideological detachment from the biological racism of his activist youth, or rather as a meta-political strategy set up to disguise non-egalitarian ideas behind more acceptable concepts. De Benoist is also an ardent critic of globalization, unrestricted mass immigration, liberalism, postmodern society, and what he calls the &quot;ideology of sameness&quot;.

Political scientist Jean-Yves Camus describes the key idea of de Benoist in those terms: &quot;[T]hrough the use of meta-politics, to think the ways and means that are necessary in order for European civilization, based on the cultural values shared on the continent until the advent of globalization, to thrive and be perpetuated.&quot; Although de Benoist embodies the core values of GRECE and the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;, his works are not always identical to those of other thinkers of the movements. He is opposed in particular to political violence, and he has declared that he had been building &quot;a school of thought, not a political movement.&quot; In 2000, he disavowed Guillaume Faye&#x27;s &quot;strongly racist&quot; ideas regarding Muslims after the publication of &quot;The Colonization of Europe: Speaking Truth about Immigration and Islam&quot;.

=== Identity ===
In 2006, de Benoist defined &quot;identity&quot; as a dialogical phenomenon, inspired by Martin Buber&#x27;s philosophy of dialogue and &quot;Ich und Du&quot; concept. According to him, one&#x27;s identity is made of two components: the &quot;objective part&quot; coming from one&#x27;s background (ethnicity, religion, family, nationality), and the &quot;subjective part&quot; freely chosen by the individual. Identity is therefore a perpetual evolution rather than a definitive notion. In 1992, de Benoist dismissed the Front National&#x27;s use of ethnopluralism on the grounds that it portrayed &quot;difference as an absolute, whereas, by definition, it exists only relationally.&quot; 

In 1966, he had written: &quot;Race is the only real unit encompassing individual variations. The objective study of history shows that only the European race (white race, caucasian) has continued to progress since its appearance on the rising path of the evolution of the living, unlike races stagnant in their development, therefore in virtual regression.&quot;
If scholars like Pierre-André Taguieff have characterized the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; as a form of mixophobia due to its focus on the notion of difference, de Benoist has also criticized what he calls &quot;the pathology of identity&quot;, that is to say the political use of identity by the populist Right in order to push an &quot;us versus them&quot; debate escorted by what he considers to be &quot;[systematic] and [irrational] hating&quot;. The difficulty of understanding de Benoist’s views on identity rests upon the fact that his writings have experienced multiple re-synthesis since the 1960s. In 1974, he said &quot;there is no superior race. All races are superior and each of them has its own genius.&quot; In 1966, he had written: &quot;The European race does not have absolute superiority. It is only the most capable of progressing in the direction of evolution ... Racial factors being statistically hereditary, each race has its own psychology. All psychology generates value.&quot; De Benoist has been influenced by Carl Schmitt&#x27;s distinction between friend and enemy as the core issue of politics. Despite this, he sees immigrants as eventually victims of globalization, and has argued that immigration was first of all a consequence of multinational companies being greedy for profits and preferring to import cheap labor.

=== Ethnopluralism ===
De Benoist rejects the nation state and nationalism on the grounds that both liberalism and nationalism eventually derive from the same metaphysics of subjectivity, and that what he describes as the centralized and Jacobin state established by the French Republic had destroyed regional identities in its project of a &quot;one and indivisible&quot; France. He stands instead for the political autonomy of each and every group, favouring an integral federalism built on the principle of subsidiarity, which in his views would transcend the nation state and give way for both regional and Europe identities to thrive. De Benoist believes that knowledge of ethnic and religious traditions is a duty that must be passed on to following generations, and he has been critical of the idea of a moral imperative to cosmopolitanism.

=== Liberalism ===
De Benoist is a critic of the primacy of individual rights, an ideology that he sees embodied in humanism, the French Revolution, and the ideas of the Founding Fathers of the United States. While not a communist, de Benoist has been influenced by the Marxist analysis of the nature of capitalism and conflicting class interests developed by Karl Marx in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. As a result, another of his core ideas is that the world is facing the &quot;hegemony of capital&quot; and the &quot;pursuit of self-interest&quot;, two typical trends of the postmodern era.

According to scholar Jean-Yves Camus, if de Benoist can share anti-capitalist analysis with leftists, the nature of his goal is indeed different since de Benoist considers the unlimited expansion of the free market and consumerism as key contributors to the erasure of peoples&#x27; identities. Furthermore, de Benoist acknowledges the existence of the working class and the bourgeoisie but does not make an essential distinction between the two of them. He rather divides society between the &quot;new dominant class&quot; and the &quot;people&quot;. In 1991, the editorial staff of his magazine &quot;Eléments&quot; described the danger of adopting a &quot;systematic anti-egalitarianism [that could] lead to social Darwinism, which might justify free-market economy&quot;.

De Benoist is opposed to the modern American liberal idea of a melting pot. A critic of the United States, he has been quoted as saying: &quot;Some people do not accept the thought of one day having to wear the Red Army cap. In fact, it is a terrible prospect. However, this is not a reason to tolerate the idea of one day having to spend what we have left to live on by eating hamburgers in Brooklyn.&quot; In 1991, he described European supporters of the first Gulf War as &quot;collaborators of the American order&quot;.

=== Monotheism ===
De Benoist has supported ties with Islamic culture in the 1980s, on the grounds that the relationship would be distinct from what he saw as the consumerism and materialism of the American society and from the bureaucracy and repression of the Soviet Union alike. He also opposes Christianity as inherently intolerant, theocratic, and bent on persecution.

== Influences ==
De Benoist&#x27;s influences include Antonio Gramsci, Ernst Jünger, Martin Buber, Jean Baudrillard, Georges Dumézil, Ernest Renan, José Ortega y Gasset, Vilfredo Pareto, Karl Marx, Guy Debord, Arnold Gehlen, Stéphane Lupasco, Helmut Schelsky, Konrad Lorenz, the Conservative Revolutionaries including Carl Schmitt and Oswald Spengler, the non-conformists of the 1930s, Johann Gottfried Herder, Johannes Althusius, interwar Austro-Marxists, and communitarian philosophers like Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor.

==Critics==

Critics of de Benoist like Thomas Sheehan argue he has developed a novel restatement of fascism. Roger Griffin, using an ideal type definition of fascism, which includes &quot;populist ultra-nationalism&quot; and &quot;palingenesis&quot; (heroic rebirth), argues that the &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; draws on such fascist ideologues as Armin Mohler in a way that allows &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; ideologues like de Benoist to claim a &quot;metapolitical&quot; stance but which nonetheless has residual fascist ideological elements. In response to accusations of fascism, de Benoist notes his support of direct democracy and localism, as well as his opposition to authoritarianism, totalitarianism, and militarism, characteristics of historical Fascism. De Benoist&#x27;s critics also claim his views recall Nazi attempts to replace German Christianity with its own paganism. They note that de Benoist&#x27;s rejection of the French Revolution&#x27;s legacy and the allegedly abstract Rights of Man ties him to the same Counter-Enlightenment right-wing tradition as counter-revolutionary Legitimists, fascists, Vichyites, and integral nationalists.

== Private life ==
Identifying as neo-pagan, de Benoist married Doris Christians, a German citizen, on 21 June 1972. They have two children. He is a member of Mensa International, a high-IQ society whose former president of the French branch was a member of the patronage committee of &quot;Nouvelle École&quot;. De Benoist owns the largest private library in France, with an estimate of 150,000 to 250,000 books.

<text>Jacob Rabinow (January 8, 1910 – September 11, 1999) was an American engineer and inventor. He earned a total of 229 U.S. patents on a variety of mechanical, optical and electrical devices.

==Biography==
Rabinow was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on January 8, 1910. In 1919, his family moved to China, then in 1921 to the United States. He graduated from the City College of New York with a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Engineering in 1933, and a Master&#x27;s Degree in Electrical Engineering in 1934. His career as an inventor began when he was hired as a mechanical engineer in 1938 by the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST). He made many developments there, mainly in defense systems, and eventually became Chief of the Electro-Mechanical Ordnance Division at NBS before leaving in 1954 to form his own company.

During this time, Rabinow invented and patented a number of revolutionary devices. Among them are the first disc-shaped magnetic storage media for computers (1954), the magnetic particle clutch (1956), the first straight-line phonograph (1959), the first self-regulating clock (1960) and his famous &quot;reading machine&quot; (1960) which was the first to use the &quot;best match&quot; principle and was the basis for the reading, sorting and processing machines used today by banks and post offices.

In 1964, Rabinow&#x27;s company joined Control Data Corporation (CDC), and until 1972 he was Vice President of CDC and head of the Rabinow Advanced Development Laboratory. In 1968 Rabinow formed the RABCO company to manufacture straight-line phonographs, and the company was later bought out by Harman Kardon Corporation. In 1972 he returned to NBS where he was Chief Research Engineer until his retirement in 1989.

In addition to his patents, Jacob Rabinow was awarded many other merits for his scientific achievements. Among them are the President&#x27;s Certificate of Merit (1948), the Industrial R&amp;D Scientist of the Year Award (1960), the IEEE&#x27;s Harry Diamond Award (1977), and the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award (1998). He published his book, &quot;Inventing for Fun and Profit&quot;, in 1989. He also delivered many speeches and lectures on inventions and technology, as a guest at many educational institutions and on several television and radio shows. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1971 to 1973.

The Jacob Rabinow Applied Research Award was created by the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST) and first presented in 1975 for outstanding achievements in the practical application of the results of scientific or engineering research.

Rabinow was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2005.

<doc id="652183" wikidata="Q1725504" url="?curid=652183" title="Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota">
<text>The lieutenant governor of Minnesota is a constitutional officer in the executive branch of the U.S. state of Minnesota. Fifty individuals have held the office of lieutenant governor since statehood. The incumbent is Peggy Flanagan, a DFLer and the first Native American elected to a statewide executive office in Minnesota&#x27;s history.

==Powers and duties==
The lieutenant governor assists the governor in carrying out the functions of the executive branch, as well as serving in the governor&#x27;s place in the event of his or her absence or disability. The governor, as prescribed by law, may file a written order with the secretary of state to delegate to the lieutenant governor any powers, duties, responsibilities, or functions otherwise performed by the governor. As a key member of the governor&#x27;s cabinet, the lieutenant governor is consulted on all major policy and budgetary decisions. Moreover, the lieutenant governor is a statutory member of the Executive Council and chairs the Capitol Area Architectural Planning Board, among other responsibilities.
==History==
In 1886, elections were moved from odd years to even years. Beginning with the 1962 election, the term of the lieutenant governor increased from two to four years. Prior to the 1974 election, governors and lieutenant governors were elected on separate ballots, with the lieutenant governor having independent legislative authority as president of the senate. Since 1974, the lieutenant governor has been relieved of the duty to preside over the state senate and is elected on a joint ticket with the governor. Marlene Johnson, elected in 1982 as the running mate of Rudy Perpich, was the first female lieutenant governor of Minnesota. All eight of her successors in that office have also been women.

<doc id="652186" wikidata="Q325734" url="?curid=652186" title="Carlos Martínez (infielder)">
<text>Carlos Alberto Martínez Escobar (August 11, 1965 – January 24, 2006) was a Venezuelan professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a first baseman and third baseman from to for the Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians and California Angels. Listed at 6&#x27; 5&quot; (1.98 m), 175 lb. (79 k), he batted and threw right handed.

==Career==
Martínez was born in La Guaira, the capital city of Vargas state in Venezuela, and played his entire career in the Venezuelan Winter League for his home city team the Tiburones de La Guaira.

Martínez, affectionately nicknamed ″Café″, was signed by the New York Yankees as a free agent in 1983. During the 1986 season, he was sent to the White Sox in the same trade that brought Ron Kittle to the Yankees. Martínez made his major league debut at the age of 22 with the Chicago White Sox in 1988.
Despite his impressive frame, Martínez never was able to fulfill the potential that he showed in the minor leagues. His most productive season came in 1989 with the White Sox, when he posted career highs in batting average (.300), at-bats (350), hits (105), runs (44) and doubles (22), and also was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team.

Besides playing for the White Sox, Martínez also spent playing time as a utility player with the Indians and made his last major-league appearance with the Angels in 1995. He is perhaps best remembered as the batter who hit the long fly ball that bounced off José Canseco&#x27;s head for a home run on May 26, 1993.

In a seven-season career in MLB, Martínez was a .258 hitter with 25 home runs and 161 RBI in 465 game appearances. His minor-league totals include a .276 batting average with 50 homers and 310 RBI in 595 games. He was a reinforcement player for the Águilas del Zulia club that won the 1989 Caribbean Series title.

==Personal life==
His son, José Martínez, is an outfielder who has played minor league baseball for the White Sox, Atlanta Braves, Kansas City Royals and St. Louis Cardinals, and in the major leagues with the Cardinals in 2016-2019, Tampa Bay Rays and Chicago Cubs in 2020, and currently plays for the New York Mets. While playing for the Royals&#x27; Triple-A affiliate Omaha Storm Chasers in 2015, he broke the Pacific Coast League (PCL) record with a .384 average and led the league in on-base percentage (OBP, .461) and was an All-Star.

Martínez died on January 24, 2006, in Catia La Mar, Vargas, at age 40 after a long battle with stomach cancer, according to an article about his son in issue #2 of Cardinals Gameday Magazine.

<doc id="652193" wikidata="Q1285072" url="?curid=652193" title="Jerry Uelsmann">
<text>Jerry Norman Uelsmann (June 11, 1934 – April 4, 2022) was an American photographer.

As an emerging artist in the 1960s, Jerry Uelsmann received international recognition for surreal, enigmatic photographs (photomontages) made with his unique method of composite printing and his dedication to revealing the deepest emotions of the human condition. Over the next six decades, his contributions to contemporary photography were firmly established with important exhibitions, prestigious awards and numerous publications. Among his awards were a Guggenheim Fellowship, National Endowment, Royal Photographic Society Fellowship, and Lucie Award.

Uelsmann described his creative process as a journey of discovery in the darkroom (visual research laboratory). Going against the established practice of previsualization (Ansel Adams, Edward Weston and others), he coined a new term, post-visualization. He decided the contents of the final print after rather than before pressing the shutter button. Uelsmann constructed his dreams like a visual poet with results that often seemed emotionally more real than the factual world. By the 1980s he became one of the most collected photographers in America. His work influenced generations of both analog and digital photographers. Although he admired digital photography, he remained completely dedicated to the alchemy of film photography in the black and white darkroom.

== Early life and education ==
Uelsmann, a native of Detroit, Michigan, credited his parents Norman (a grocer,1904-1962) and Florence (Crossman) Uelsmann (a homemaker, 1903–1986) for encouraging his creativity. His mother saved his artworks beginning in kindergarten and continuing into college. Uelsmann&#x27;s father, whose hobby was photography, built a basement darkroom () to share with his two sons, Jerry and Robert.

In high school he worked as a photographer for the school newspaper and later attended Rochester Institute of Technology earning a BFA degree in 1957.

At RIT he was influenced by Minor White and Ralph Hattersley who taught craftsmanship (technical precision) along with the emotional and perceptual aspects of fine arts photography. Uelsmann appreciated White&#x27;s mystical philosophy and devotion to Zen-like meditation even when not photographing. He was particularly affected by Minor White&#x27;s belief that fine arts photographers should “strive to capture subjects for what they are and for what else they are”.

Ralph Hattersley had theories like those of Minor White especially concerning self-discovery about which he published a text. A portrait of Hattersley by Uelsmann was used for the cover of Hattersley&#x27;s book, &quot;Discover Your Self Through Photography&quot;. Uelsmann recalled the demanding yet meaningful assignments given by Hattersley that caused him to see ordinary objects differently and personally. Visual and spiritual awareness were of paramount importance compared to the photographic equipment.  As a student, Uelsmann used many camera formats but settled on a relatively simple medium format (Bronica) for most of his career.

After graduating from Rochester Institute of Technology, Uelsmann enrolled at Indiana University and met Professor Henry Holmes Smith (a mentee of László Moholy-Nagy).  He described Smith as a “mind-bomb of inspirational ideas” and challenging questions that encouraged experimentation with concepts and images.

Uelsmann took extensive art history courses and was particularly fascinated by surrealists including René Magritte, Joseph Cornell, and Man Ray, all of whom worked from dreams, fantasies, and visions. Also, he admired  the avant-garde techniques of Bauhaus photographers and the intuition of abstract expressionists. He claimed a debt to the 19th-century photomontage artists, Oscar Gustave Rejlander and Henry Peach Robinson.  Vincent Van Gogh influenced Uelsmann, too.  During a modern art history course at Indiana University, Uelsmann saw an image by Van Gogh and suddenly remembered seeing the same painting (a self-portrait) when he was twelve years old at the Detroit Institute of Arts.  He had forgotten the artist&#x27;s name but never forgot how the painting made him feel.  Both Van Gogh and Uelsmann produced expressive self-portraits, although the ones by Uelsmann were often shown as anonymous figures suggesting everyman and named &quot;Untitled&quot;.

In 1960, Uelsmann earned two degrees from Indiana University, MS (audio-visual studies) and MFA (fine arts photography).

== Early career ==
Uelsmann was recruited in 1960 by Van Deren Coke to teach at the University of Florida, one of the few universities offering photography as a concentration for fine arts majors. He taught at UF until his retirement in 1998.

The first twenty years of his career (1960-1980) involved widespread success with numerous honors in education, writings, and exhibitions.

In 1962, he was one of the founders of the Society for Photographic Education (SPE) which held annual meetings where educators, students and historians could share their ideas and images about photography&#x27;s relationship to themselves and the world.

Uelsmann delivered his first influential paper, “The Interrelationship of Image and Technique,&quot; at the SPE initial conference (1962 in Rochester, NY). His second paper, “Post-Visualization,” was presented in 1964 at the SPE in Chicago, IL. Some details on post-visualization and his technique of composite printing can be found below in Additional Notes and in his book &quot;Process and Perception.&quot;

He had a career breakthrough in 1967 with a solo exhibition of photomontages at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. John Szarkowski was the director.

Also, in 1967 he won a Guggenheim Fellowship for “Experiments in Multiple Printing Techniques in Photography”. With the grant, he worked on various techniques of printing and experimented with subtle colors from toners such as blues and browns.

In 1968 he returned to the Museum of Modern Art to be included in “Photography as Printmaking”, directed by Peter C. Bunnell. The exhibition increased awareness of innovative contemporary photography as a worthy addition to realistic photography.

Beginning in 1968 and continuing for decades, he scheduled extensive workshops throughout the nation for demonstrations, lectures, and hands-on practice to small groups of students.  The first year of workshops included Rhode Island School of Design, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Iowa, The Art Institute of Chicago, San Francisco Museum of Art, Purdue University, Ohio University, Addison Gallery of American Art, George Eastman House, The Friends of Photography (Carmel, CA), University of St. Thomas, and Wheaton College.

In 1972, he won a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 1978 Uelsmann was included in &quot;Mirrors and Windows: American Photography since 1960&quot; directed by John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art, NY. The show reflected on two theories of contemporary photographers. One theory was about self-expression (mirror of oneself) and the second one involved observations outside of oneself with an emphasis on objectivity. There were a few artists who crossed over between these two theories. The exhibition and book were influential and stimulated much discussion pro and con.

In 1981, Jerry Uelsmann was named one of the top ten most collected photographers by &quot;American Photographer&quot; magazine.

=== Bertram Cox Memorial Lecture, 1971 ===
Uelsmann was inducted (1970) as a fellow by the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain (London) and invited to deliver the fourth Bertram Cox Memorial Lecture in early 1971. His paper was entitled, “Some Humanistic Considerations of Photography”, most of which is archived online. Using specific examples, he explained his process of post-visualization (trying different combinations of negatives). Prior to his sessions in the darkroom, he would study hundreds of negatives using contact sheets (proof sheets). The final print could take hours or days to resolve, but the journey was always magical according to Uelsmann. Trial and error were essential steps.

He expressed gratitude for what photography revealed about himself and his fellow human beings. A persistent theme was about the never ending mysteries of life.

Beginning in the mid-1960s Uelsmann preferred the title, &quot;Untitled&quot;, for most of his photographs to invite various interpretations.  

He described his persona as “an unapologetic romantic” who loves working in the darkroom.

Other parts of his lecture contained humor for which Uelsmann  was noted. He joked about negative sandwiches and the random decision of using a leaf of lettuce saying he finally had a negative sandwich that was edible.

Another joke was about falling in a mud hole while on a shooting trip. When he got home, he finished the roll of film by taking photos of his muddy body (self-timer and tripod) while in the bathtub.  Although he did not like the print, he sent it to John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art (NY) with a letter written on the back. The surprise was that Szarkowski used the photo for a press release (calendar about exhibitions). Uelsmann, a gifted speaker, gave a memorable lecture combining humor with seriousness.

== Mid- to late-career ==
During his last four decades (1980 to 2022), Uelsmann regularly exhibited while publishing over twenty-five books about his work.

A few of those achievements are summarized below.

* In 1989 he had a fifty-print exhibition of recent work entitled “Jerry N. Uelsmann: Magic and Poetry in Photography” in Chicago, IL. One reviewer, Larry Thall, commented on Uelsmann&#x27;s long-standing popularity and importance. The new work evoked his consistent themes and intriguing metaphors about birth, death and the journey in between. Larry Thall observed a heightened concern by Uelsmann regarding the environment. He mentioned photographs showing pristine nature with both congruent and incongruent aspects. For example, he referenced a photograph of the wilderness in Yosemite that, at first, looks normal. The central yet contradictory subject, an office desk on fire, is perfectly blended into the scene.

* After retiring from the University of Florida in 1998, Uelsmann set new goals and kept a busy schedule. Although he had shown internationally since the 1970s, he increased his presence abroad in the 21st century.

* In 2001–2002, Uelsmann participated in an extended interview with photographer, Robert J. Hirsch. The interview contains statements about the value of Uelsmann&#x27;s personal expressive theory during a time of national disaster post September 11, 2001. The interview was published in &quot;Photo Vision Magazine&quot; which is not indexed. A website showing the interview was still available July 8, 2022.

* During 2006-2007, he and Maggie Taylor, a noted digital photographer, produced several two-person exhibitions in the United States, Korea, China, and Italy.

* In 2011-2012 he was featured in a retrospective exhibition, “The Mind’s Eye, 50 Years of Photography by Jerry Uelsmann”. The show premiered at the Harn Museum of Art in Gainesville, FL in 2011. It traveled to the Peabody Essex Museum of Art, Salem, MA and the James A. Michener Museum, Doylestown, PA.

* In 2015, he gave a short speech at Carnegie Hall (NY) as an honoree receiving a Lucie Award for achievement in Fine Art.

* In 2018, he had a solo exhibition in Baton Rouge, LA at the Louisiana State University Museum of Art. The show&#x27;s title, &quot;Confluence&quot;, referred to the flowing nature of Uelsmann&#x27;s conversations (in 2018) with the scholar, Moa Petersén, especially in reference to love and loss. This dialogue inspired new work. In a lecture for the show&#x27;s opening, Uelsmann talked about the emotional highs and lows evident in his photography as metaphors for life.

* He recalled one of the highs being his friendship with Ansel Adams citing a letter Uelsmann had recently rediscovered. Adams, an early and steadfast supporter of Uelsmann, was his senior by 32 years. In the letter (dated 1969), Adams referred to Uelsmann as the “eighth wonder of the world”.

* Adams wrote that on the eighth day of the creation, Jerry Uelsmann was invented because “things needed moving around”.

:The photographs of Ansel Adams (realist) and Jerry Uelsmann (surrealist) had at least two common traits. The image quality and focus were superb with meticulously printed black and white photos (mostly landscapes).  Both artists were dedicated to producing hand-made images.  Although they represented different art theories, they shared a common goal of authenticity (authentic feelings).  Uelsmann insisted that photographic theory is not a competition.

* He recalled a whimsical photograph taken in 1969 showing Ansel Adams and one of his Group f/64 partners, Imogen Cunningham, anointing Uelsmann as an honorary West Coast photographer. A print of the scene, photographed by Ted Orland in Point Lobos, CA, is owned by Boston&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts.

* In 2020 Uelsmann gave what may have been his last interview. It was recorded from his darkroom via Zoom video conferencing software and was hosted by Russell Brown, an associate of Adobe Corporation.

== Style and technique ==
Uelsmann produced composite photographs with multiple negatives and extensive darkroom work. He operated up to a dozen enlargers to produce his final images drawing from a large archive of negatives. When beginning a photomontage, he had a strong intuitive sense of what he was looking for, some strategy for how to find it, and an understanding that mistakes are inevitable and are part of the creative process. His darkroom session began by studying his negatives. He covered a large drafting table with hundreds of proof sheets. He folded and overlapped various contact prints, explored the visual possibilities, then brought the options into his darkroom. The negatives he had chosen were placed into different enlargers. He moved the photo paper progressively down the line of enlargers building up an image. Uelsmann was a firm believer that the final image need not be tied to a single negative.

Uelsmann&#x27;s interpretations invite the viewer to interact with the subject. There are many right answers available when one is willing to contemplate the possibilities. &quot;Untitled&quot; (&quot;Boat and Moon&quot;) demonstrates his ability to seamlessly blend multiple photographs into one image that appears to reinvent reality.

== Critical response ==
Although many writers published positive, well documented remarks about Uelsmann, there were others who argued that his work was interesting but too manipulated to be photography. Many advocates of realism believed that a photograph should never be manipulated. Uelsmann was often his own humble critic.  He commented in interviews that only 10 to 15 percent of his yearly output of 100-150 photographs stood the test of time according to his own judgement.

Uelsmann, in an interview, talked about a cultural shift away from the poetic expressiveness of the counterculture and beat generation of the 1950s and 1960s that became obvious. For example, in photography he had witnessed a decline in surrealistic photographers being shown in  major museums in the late 1970s and 1980s.  However, he remained undaunted and devoted to his philosophy of being personal and finding truth within oneself.

The digital age inadvertently created a new audience for Uelsmann.  In the 1990s when Photoshop emerged with its seemingly endless image-altering possibilities, surrealism was revived.  In the 21st century, a young generation of photographers became fascinated with Uelsmann&#x27;s work.

Uelsmann enjoyed sharing his experiences and seeing the photographs of young artists. His lecture at the Michener Museum in PA (2012) is one example that is available online. The students were impressed with his work ethic.  They admired his extroverted personality, wit and patience which defined his career and was well summarized by several writers.

According to Peter Bunnell, Uelsmann had a passion for people but also could sustain days alone in the darkroom.  John Paul Caponigro suggested that Uelsmann&#x27;s sense of humor and vivaciousness helped him deal with the darker side of life in his artwork. Music energized his darkroom including jazz, blues, rock and  classical.  Uelsmann memorized Broadway and popular tunes which he spontaneously sang even during social gatherings at his home or in lectures. He believed in angels (spirits) commenting about the science and mystery of angels in most religions.  Several unique varieties of angels appear in his photographs.  In contrast to Uelsmann&#x27;s exuberance  in everyday life, his photographs are rarely humorous. One example of humor is his photograph entitled &quot;Flamingos in Yosemite&quot;.

Some clues about the source of his ideas could be seen in Uelsmann&#x27;s home.

His multi-windowed, contemporary home was surrounded by majestic live oaks with their perpetual mystery. Huge, serpentine-shaped limbs often touch the ground then turn upwards. Uelsmann&#x27;s sizable darkroom was filled with trinkets such as small toys, bric-a-brac, decals, old cameras, valentines, and pop culture icons (like Mickey Mouse) presenting a visual wonderland that served for laughter and ideas. He often photographed miniature items like the white toy boat that appeared in some of his images. One of the “boat” photographs (&quot;Untitled&quot;) shows an empty white boat surrounded by dark waters and a distant light (moon). It has sometimes been linked to Minor White&#x27;s statement before dying, “a boat is waiting for me”. Uelsmann stated that this interpretation was one of many possibilities. He believed that messages (feelings) evoked from any image are derived from the experiences of the viewer.

== Personal life ==
Jerry Uelsmann was married three times in this order: Marilynn Kamischke (later Marilyn Schlott), Diane Farris, and Maggie Taylor.

The marriages ended in divorce. With Diane Farris, he had one son, Andrew, and two grandchildren.

He died on April 4, 2022, at the age 87 In Gainesville, Florida.

<text>Emission standards &lt;section begin=overview /&gt;are the legal requirements governing air pollutants released into the atmosphere. Emission standards set quantitative limits on the permissible amount of specific air pollutants that may be released from specific sources over specific timeframes. They are generally designed to achieve air quality standards and to protect human life. Different regions and countries have different standards for vehicle emissions. &lt;section end=overview /&gt;

== Regulated sources ==
Many emissions standards focus on regulating pollutants released by automobiles (motor cars) and other powered vehicles. Others regulate emissions from industry, power plants, small equipment such as lawn mowers and diesel generators, and other sources of air pollution.

The first automobile emissions standards were enacted in 1963 in the United States, mainly as a response to Los Angeles&#x27; smog problems. Three years later Japan enacted their first emissions rules, followed between 1970 and 1972 by Canada, Australia, and several European nations. The early standards mainly concerned carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC). Regulations on nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) were introduced in the United States, Japan, and Canada in 1973 and 1974, with Sweden following in 1976 and the European Economic Community in 1977. These standards gradually grew more and more stringent but have never been unified.

There are largely three main sets of standards: United States, Japanese, and European, with various markets mostly using these as their base. Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia had separate emissions standards for many years but have since adopted the European standards. India, China, and other newer markets have also begun enforcing vehicle emissions standards (derived from the European requirements) in the twenty-first century, as growing vehicle fleets have given rise to severe air quality problems there, too.

==Vehicle emission performance standard==

An emission performance standard is a limit that sets thresholds above which a different type of vehicle emissions control technology might be needed. While emission performance standards have been used to dictate limits for conventional pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulphur (NOx and SOx), this regulatory technique may be used to regulate greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (). In the US, this is given in pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (lbs. /MWhr), and kilograms /MWhr elsewhere.

==Africa==
===ECOWAS===
* Since 1 January 2021, all new vehicles in ECOWAS must comply with Euro 4.

===Morocco===
From 1 January 2024, all new vehicles in Morocco must comply with Euro 6b.

===South Africa===
South Africa&#x27;s first clean fuels programme was implemented in 2006 with the banning of lead from petrol and the reduction of sulphur levels in diesel from 3,000 parts per million (ppm) to 500 ppm, along with a niche grade of 50 ppm.

The Clean Fuels 2 standard, expected to begin in 2017, includes the reduction of sulphur to 10 ppm; the lowering of benzene from 5 percent to 1 percent of volume; the reduction of aromatics from 50 percent to 35 percent of volume; and the specification of olefins at 18 percent of volume.

==North America==
===Canada===
In Canada, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) transfers the legislative authority for regulating emissions from on-road vehicles and engines to Environment Canada from Transport Canada&#x27;s Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
The Regulations align emission standards with the U.S. federal standards and apply to light-duty vehicles (e.g., passenger cars), light-duty trucks (e.g., vans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles), heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., trucks and buses), heavy-duty engines and motorcycles.

===Mexico===
* From 1 July 2019, all new heavy vehicles must comply with EPA 07 and Euro 5.
* From 1 January 2025, all new heavy vehicles must comply with EPA 10 and Euro 6.

===United States===

The United States has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet. In the United States, emissions standards are managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It uses tiers to identify emission standards for cars, trucks and other motor vehicles. In 2014, the EPA published its &quot;Tier 3&quot; standards for these vehicles, which tightened air pollution emission requirements and lowered the sulfur content in gasoline.

EPA has separate regulations for small engines, such as groundskeeping equipment. The states must also promulgate miscellaneous emissions regulations in order to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

In December 2021 EPA issued new greenhouse gas standards for passenger cars and light trucks, effective for the 2023 vehicle model year.

====State-level standards====

Under federal law, the state of California is allowed to promulgate more stringent vehicle emissions standards (subject to EPA approval), and other states may choose to follow either the national or California standards. California had produced air quality standards prior to EPA, with severe air quality problems in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. LA is the country&#x27;s second-largest city, by population, and relies much more heavily on automobiles and has less favorable meteorological conditions than the largest and third-largest cities (New York and Chicago).

Some states have areas within the state that require emissions testing while other cities within the state do not require emission testing. Arizona emissions testing locations are located primarily in the two largest metropolitan areas (Phoenix and Tucson). People outside of these areas are not required to submit their vehicle for testing as these areas are the only ones that have failed the air quality tests by the state.

California&#x27;s emissions standards are set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). By mid-2009, 16 other states had adopted CARB rules; given the size of the California market plus these other states, many manufacturers choose to build to the CARB standard when selling in all 50 states. CARB&#x27;s policies have also influenced EU emissions standards.

California is attempting to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, but faces a court challenge from the federal government. The states are also attempting to compel the federal EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which as of 2007 it has declined to do. On 19 May 2009, news reports indicate that the Federal EPA will largely adopt California&#x27;s standards on greenhouse gas emissions.

California and several other western states have passed bills requiring performance-based regulation of greenhouse gases from electricity generation.

In an effort to decrease emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines faster, CARB&#x27;s Carl Moyer Program funds upgrades that are in advance of regulations.

The California ARB standard for light vehicle emissions is a regulation of equipment first, with verification of emissions second. The property owner of the vehicle is not permitted to modify, improve, or innovate solutions in order to pass a true emissions-only standard set for their vehicle driven on public highways. Therefore, California&#x27;s attempt at regulation of emissions is a regulation of equipment, not of air quality. Vehicle owners are excluded from modifying their property in any way that has not been extensively researched and approved by CARB and still operate them on public highways.

===China===
Due to rapidly expanding wealth and prosperity, the number of coal power plants and cars on China&#x27;s roads is rapidly growing, creating an ongoing pollution problem. China enacted its first emissions controls on automobiles in 2000, equivalent to Euro I standards. China&#x27;s State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) upgraded emission controls again on 1 July 2004 to the Euro II standard. More stringent emission standard, National Standard III, equivalent to Euro III standards, went into effect on 1 July 2007. Plans were for Euro IV standards to take effect in 2010. Beijing introduced the Euro IV standard in advance on 1 January 2008, becoming the first city in mainland China to adopt this standard.
* Since 1 January 2018, all new vehicles must comply with China 5 (similar to Euro 5).
* Since 1 January 2021, all new vehicles in China must comply with China 6a (similar to Euro 6).
* Since 1 July 2023, all new vehicles in China must comply with China 6b (stricter than Euro 6).

===Hong Kong===

From 1 January 2006, all new passenger cars with spark-ignition engines in Hong Kong must meet either Euro IV petrol standard, Japanese Heisei 17 standard or US EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard. For new passenger cars with compression-ignition engines, they must meet US EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard.

The current standard is Euro 6C, it has been phased in since 2019.

===India===
Bharat stage emission standards are emission standards instituted by the Government of India to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engine equipment, including motor vehicles. The standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the Central Pollution Control Board under the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests.

The standards, based on European regulations were first introduced in 2000. Progressively stringent norms have been rolled out since then. All new vehicles manufactured after the implementation of the norms have to be compliant with the regulations. By 2014, the country was under a combination of Euro 3 and Euro 4-based norms, with Euro 4 standards partly implemented in 13 major cities. Till April 2017, the entire country was under BS IV norms, which is based on Euro 4.

As of now manufacturing and registration of BS VI vehicles has started, from April 2020 all BS VI manufacturing is mandatory, respectively.

===Japan===
 Background 

Starting 10 June 1968, the Japanese Government passed the which regulated all sources of air pollutants. As a result of the 1968 law, dispute resolutions were passed under the 1970 . As a result of the 1970 law, in 1973 the first installment of four sets of new emissions standards were introduced. Interim standards were introduced on 1 January 1975, and again for 1976. The final set of standards were introduced for 1978. While the standards were introduced they were not made immediately mandatory, instead tax breaks were offered for cars which passed them. The standards were based on those adopted by the original US Clean Air Act of 1970, but the test cycle included more slow city driving to correctly reflect the Japanese situation. The 1978 limits for &quot;mean emissions&quot; during a &quot;Hot Start Test&quot; of CO, hydrocarbons, and were of CO, of HC, and of respectively. Maximum limits are of CO, of HC, and of . One interesting detail of the Japanese emissions standards was that they were introduced in a soft manner; that is, 1978 model year cars could be sold that did not meet the 1978 standards, but they would suffer various tax penalties. This gave manufacturers breathing room to properly engineer solutions and also incentivized fixing the best-selling models first, leading to smoother adoption of clean air standards and fewer drivability concerns than in many other markets.

The &quot;10 - 15 Mode Hot Cycle&quot; test, used to determine individual fuel economy ratings and emissions observed from the vehicle being tested, use a specific testing regime.

In 1992, to cope with pollution problems from existing vehicle fleets in highly populated metropolitan areas, the Ministry of the Environment adopted the , called in short The Motor Vehicle Law. The regulation designated a total of 196 communities in the Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa, Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures as areas with significant air pollution due to nitrogen oxides emitted from motor vehicles. Under the Law, several measures had to be taken to control from in-use vehicles, including enforcing emission standards for specified vehicle categories.

The regulation was amended in June 2001 to tighten the existing requirements and to add PM control provisions. The amended rule is called the &quot;Law Concerning Special Measures to Reduce the Total Amount of Nitrogen Oxides and Particulate Matter Emitted from Motor Vehicles in Specified Areas&quot;, or in short the Automotive and PM Law.

;Emission Standards

The and PM Law introduces emission standards for specified categories of in-use highway vehicles including commercial goods (cargo) vehicles such as trucks and vans, buses, and special purpose motor vehicles, irrespective of the fuel type. The regulation also applies to diesel powered passenger cars (but not to gasoline cars).

In-use vehicles in the specified categories must meet 1997/98 emission standards for the respective new vehicle type (in the case of heavy duty engines = 4.5 g/kWh, PM = 0.25 g/kWh). In other words, the 1997/98 new vehicle standards are retroactively applied to older vehicles already on the road. Vehicle owners have two methods to comply:

# Replace old vehicles with newer, cleaner models
# Retrofit old vehicles with approved and PM control devices

Vehicles have a grace period, between 8 and 12 years from the initial registration, to comply. The grace period depends on the vehicle type, as follows:
* Light commercial vehicles (GVW ≤ 2500 kg): 8 years
* Heavy commercial vehicles (GVW &gt; 2500 kg): 9 years
* Micro buses (11-29 seats): 10 years
* Large buses (≥ 30 seats): 12 years
* Special vehicles (based on a cargo truck or bus): 10 years
* Diesel passenger cars: 9 years

Furthermore, the regulation allows fulfillment of its requirements to be postponed by an additional 0.5–2.5 years, depending on the age of the vehicle. This delay was introduced in part to harmonize the and PM Law with the Tokyo diesel retrofit program.

The and PM Law is enforced in connection with Japanese vehicle inspection program, where non-complying vehicles cannot undergo the inspection in the designated areas. This, in turn, may trigger an injunction on the vehicle operation under the Road Transport Vehicle Law.

===Thailand===
From 1 January 2024, all new vehicles in Thailand must comply with Euro 5.

===Turkey===
Diesel and gasoline sulphur content is regulated at 10 ppm. Turkey currently follows Euro VI for heavy duty commercial vehicles, and, in 2016 a couple of years after the EU, Turkey adopted Euro 6 for new types of light duty vehicles (LDV) and new types of passenger cars. Turkey is planning to use the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure (WLTP).

However, despite these tailpipe emission standards for new vehicle types there are many older diesel vehicles, no low-emission zones and no national limit on PM2.5 particulates so local pollution, including from older vehicles, is still a major health risk in some cities, such as Ankara. Concentrations of PM2.5 are 41 μg/m3 in Turkey, making it the country with the worst air pollution in Europe. The regulation for testing of existing vehicle exhaust gases is Official Newspaper number 30004 published 11 March 2017.

An average of 135 g /km for LDVs compared well with other countries in 2015, however unlike the EU there is no limit on carbon dioxide emissions.

===Vietnam===
From 1 January 2022, all new cars in Vietnam must comply with Euro 5.

==Europe==
Before the European Union began streamlining emissions standards, there were several different sets of rules. Members of the European Economic Community (EEC) had a unified set of rules, considerably laxer than those of the United States or Japan. These were tightened gradually, beginning on cars of over two liters displacement as the price increase would have less of an impact in this segment. The ECE 15/05 norms (also known as the Luxemburg accord, strict enough to essentially require catalytic converters) began taking effect gradually: the initial step applied to cars of over 2000 cc in two stages, in October 1988 and October 1989. There followed cars between 1.4 and 2.0 liters, in October 1991 and then October 1993. Cars of under 1400 cc had to meet two subsequent sets of regulations that applied in October 1992 and October 1994 respectively. French and Italian car manufacturers, strongly represented in the small car category, had been lobbying heavily against these regulations throughout the 1980s.

Within the EEC, Germany was a leader in regulating automobile emissions. Germany gave financial incentives to buyers of cars that met US or ECE standards, with lesser credits available to those that partially fulfilled the requirements. These incentives had a strong impact; only 6.5 percent of new cars registered in Germany in 1988 did not meet any emissions requirements and 67.3 percent were compliant with the strictest US or ECE standards.

Sweden was one of the first countries to instill stricter rules (in 1975), placing severe limitations on the number of vehicles available there. These standards also caused drivability problems and steeply increased fuel consumption - in part because manufacturers could not justify the expenditure to meet specific regulations that applied only in one very small market. In 1982, the European Community calculated that the Swedish standards increased fuel consumption by 9 percent, while it made cars 2.5 percent more expensive. In 1983, Switzerland (and then Australia) joined in the same set of regulations, which gradually increased the number of certified engines. One problem with the strict standards was that they did not account for catalyzed engines, meaning that vehicles thus equipped had to have the catalytic converters removed before they could be legally registered.

In 1985 the first catalyzed cars entered certain European markets such as Germany. At first, the availability of unleaded petrol was limited and sales were small. In Sweden, catalyzed vehicles became allowed in 1987, benefitting from a tax rebate to boost sales. By 1989 the Swiss/Swedish emissions rules were tightened to the point that non-catalyzed cars were no longer able to be sold. In early 1989 the BMW Z1 was introduced, only available with catalyzed engines. This was a problem in some places like Portugal, where unleaded fuel was still almost non-existent, although European standards required unleaded gasoline to be &quot;available&quot; in every country by 1 October 1989.

===European Union===

The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation. In 2019, it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU. In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in the transport economic sector. In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources.

The European Union has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet. Currently, standards are set for all road vehicles, trains, barges and &#x27;nonroad mobile machinery&#x27; (such as tractors). No standards apply to seagoing ships or airplanes.

EU Regulation No 443/2009 set an average emissions target for new passenger cars of 130 grams per kilometre. The target was gradually phased in between 2012 and 2015. A target of 95 grams per kilometre applies from 2021.

For light commercial vehicle, an emissions target of 175 g/km applies from 2017, and 147 g/km from 2020, a reduction of 16%.

The EU introduced Euro 4 effective 1 January 2008, Euro 5 effective 1 January 2010, and Euro 6 effective 1 January 2014. These dates had been postponed for two years to give oil refineries the opportunity to modernize their plants.

From January 2022, all new light vehicles must comply with Euro 6d. From 1 January 2023, all new motorcycles must comply with Euro 5.

===Russia===
* All new light vehicles must comply with Euro 5 since January 2016.
* All new heavy vehicles must comply with Euro 5 since 2018.

===UK===

Several local authorities in the UK have introduced Euro 4 or Euro 5 emissions standards for taxis and licensed private hire vehicles to operate in their area.
Emissions tests on diesel cars have not been carried out during MOTs in Northern Ireland for 12 years, despite being legally required.

From January 2022, all new light vehicles must comply with Euro 6d. From 1 January 2023, all new motorcycles must comply with Euro 5.

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===
Australian noxious emission standards are based on European regulations for light-duty and heavy-duty (heavy goods) vehicles, with acceptance of selected US and Japanese standards. The current policy is to fully harmonize Australian regulations with United Nations (UN) and Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) standards. In November 2013, the first stage of the stringent Euro 5 emission standards for light vehicles was introduced, which includes cars and light commercial vehicles. The development of emission standards for highway vehicles and engines is coordinated by the National Transport Commission (NTC) and the regulations—Australian Design Rules (ADR)—are administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport.

All new vehicles manufactured or sold in the country must comply with the standards, which are tested by running the vehicle or engine in a standardized test cycle.

In April 2023, the Australian government released its National Electric Vehicle Strategy, which included a commitment to introduce a Fuel Efficiency Standard to address greenhouse gas emissions. The government undertook consultation on the model for the standard in April and May 2023, and they intend to introduce legislation by the end of 2023 Research commissioned by environmental NGO Solar Citizens has calculated that a Fuel Efficiency Standard that started at 95g CO2/km and reduced to 0g CO2/km over ten years would save Australian motorists $11b over the first five years.

From December 2025, all new vehicles sold in Australia will have to comply with Euro 6d.

<text>A web counter or hit counter is a publicly displayed running tally of the number of visits a webpage has received.

Web counters are usually displayed as an inline digital image or in plain text. Image rendering of digits may use a variety of fonts and styles, with a classic design imitating the wheels of an odometer. Web counters were often accompanied by the date it was set up or last reset, to provide more context to readers on how to interpret the number shown. Although initially a way to publicly showcase a site&#x27;s popularity to its visitors, some early web counters were simply web bugs used by webmasters to track hits and included no visible on-page elements.

Counters were popular in the 1990s, but were later replaced by other web traffic measures such as self-hosted scripts like Analog, and later on by remote systems that used JavaScript, like Google Analytics. These systems typically do not include on-page elements displaying the count. Thus, seeing a web counter on a modern web page is one example of retrocomputing on the Internet.

Owing to their ubiquity, hit counters were also a useful tool to collect data on the global usage share of web browsers for a time.

== Counter SEO schemes ==

In one SEO spamming technique, companies paid to have their site listed in the HTML code of a free hit counter. When a webmaster put it on their page, a small link appeared at the bottom, providing a way for sites to artificially accumulate inbound links. This was often done by sites in very competitive industries like online gambling. In 2008, Google removed a number of high-ranking mesothelioma sites that had been using counters from the top results.

<doc id="652209" wikidata="Q24779306" url="?curid=652209" title="Phytochrome">
<text>Phytochromes are a class of photoreceptor proteins found in plants, bacteria and fungi. They respond to light in the red and far-red regions of the visible spectrum and can be classed as either Type I, which are activated by far-red light, or Type II that are activated by red light. Recent advances have suggested that phytochromes also act as temperature sensors, as warmer temperatures enhance their de-activation. All of these factors contribute to the plant&#x27;s ability to germinate.

Phytochromes control many aspects of plant development. They regulate the germination of seeds (photoblasty), the synthesis of chlorophyll, the elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number and movement of leaves and the timing of flowering in adult plants. Phytochromes are widely expressed across many tissues and developmental stages.

Other plant photoreceptors include cryptochromes and phototropins, which respond to blue and ultraviolet-A light and UVR8, which is sensitive to ultraviolet-B light.

== Structure ==
Phytochromes consist of a protein, covalently linked to a light-sensing bilin chromophore. The protein part comprises two identical chains (A and B). Each chain has a PAS domain, GAF domain and PHY domain. Domain arrangements in plant, bacterial and fungal phytochromes are comparable, insofar as the three N-terminal domains are always PAS, GAF and PHY domains. However C-terminal domains are more divergent. The PAS domain serves as a signal sensor and the GAF domain is responsible for binding to cGMP and also senses light signals. Together, these subunits form the phytochrome region, which regulates physiological changes in plants to changes in red and far red light conditions. In plants, red light changes phytochrome to its biologically active form, while far red light changes the protein to its biologically inactive form.

== Isoforms and states ==

Phytochromes are characterized by a red/far-red photochromicity. Photochromic pigments change their &quot;color&quot; (spectral absorbance properties) upon light absorption. In the case of phytochrome the ground state is Pr, the r indicating that it absorbs red light particularly strongly. The absorbance maximum is a sharp peak 650–670 nm, so concentrated phytochrome solutions look turquoise-blue to the human eye when viewed with white light. But once a red photon has been absorbed, the pigment undergoes a rapid conformational change to form the Pfr state. Here fr indicates that now not red but far-red (also called &quot;near infra-red&quot;; 705–740 nm) is differentially absorbed. This shift in absorbance is apparent to the human eye as a slightly more greenish color. When Pfr absorbs far-red light it is converted back to Pr. Hence, red light makes Pfr, far-red light makes Pr. In plants at least Pfr is the physiologically active or &quot;signalling&quot; state.

===Phytochromes&#x27; effect on phototropism===

Phytochromes also have the ability to sense light, which causes the plant to grow towards it. This is called phototropism. Janoudi and his fellow coworkers wanted to see what type of phytochrome was responsible for causing phototropism to occur, and performed a series of experiments. They found that blue light causes the plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; to exhibit a phototropic response; this curvature is heightened with the addition of red light. They also found that five different phytochromes were present in the plant, while some mutants that did not function properly expressed a lack of phytochromes. Two of these mutant variants were very important for this study: phyA-101 and phyB-1. These are the mutants of phytochrome A and B respectively. The normally functional phytochrome A causes a sensitivity to far red light, and it causes a regulation in the expression of curvature toward the light, whereas phytochrome B is more sensitive to the red light.

The experiment consisted in the wild-type form of Arabidopsis, phyA-101(phytochrome A (phyA) null mutant), phyB-1 (phytochrome B deficient mutant). They were then exposed to white light as a control blue and red light at different fluences of light, the curvature was measured. It was determined that in order to achieve a phenotype of that of the wild-type phyA-101 must be exposed to four orders of higher magnitude or about 100umol m−2 fluence. However, the fluence that causes phyB-1 to exhibit the same curvature as the wild-type is identical to that of the wild-type. The phytochrome that expressed more than normal amounts of phytochrome A it was found that as the fluence increased the curvature also increased up to 10umol-m−2 the curvature was similar to the wild-type. The phytochrome expressing more than normal amounts of phytochrome B exhibited curvatures similar to that of the wild type at different fluences of red light up until the fluence of 100umol-m−2 at fluences higher than this curvature was much higher than the wild-type.

Thus, the experiment resulted in the finding that another phytochrome than just phytochrome A acts in influencing the curvature since the mutant is not that far off from the wild-type, and phyA is not expressed at all. Thus leading to the conclusion that two phases must be responsible for phototropism. They determined that the response occurs at low fluences, and at high fluences. This is because for phyA-101 the threshold for curvature occurred at higher fluences, but curvature also occurs at low fluence values. Since the threshold of the mutant occurs at high fluence values it has been determined that phytochrome A is not responsible for curvature at high fluence values. Since the mutant for phytochrome B exhibited a response similar to that of the wild-type, it had been concluded that phytochrome B is not needed for low or high fluence exposure enhancement. It was predicted that the mutants that over expressed phytochrome A and B would be more sensitive. However, it is shown that an over expression of phy A does not really effect the curvature, thus there is enough of the phytochrome in the wild-type to achieve maximum curvature. For the phytochrome B over expression mutant higher curvature than normal at higher fluences of light indicated that phy B controls curvature at high fluences. Overall, they concluded that phytochrome A controls curvature at low fluences of light.

===Phytochrome effect on root growth===

Phytochromes can also affect root growth. It has been well documented that gravitropism is the main tropism in roots. However, a recent study has shown that phototropism also plays a role. A red light induced positive phototropism has been recently recorded in an experiment that used Arabidopsis to test where in the plant had the most effect on a positive phototropic response. The experimenters utilized an apparatus that allowed for root apex to be zero degrees so that gravitropism could not be a competing factor. When placed in red light, Arabidopsis roots displayed a curvature of 30 to 40 degrees. This showed a positive phototropic response in the red light. They then wanted to pinpoint exactly where in the plant light is received. When roots were covered there was little to no curvature of the roots when exposed to red light. In contrast, when shoots were covered, there was a positive phototropic response to the red light. This proves that lateral roots is where light sensing takes place. In order to further gather information regarding the phytochromes involved in this activity, phytochrome A, B, D and E mutants, and WT roots were exposed to red light. Phytochrome A and B mutants were severely impaired. There was no significant difference in the response of &quot;phyD&quot; and &quot;phyE&quot; compared with the wildtype, implying that &quot;phyA&quot; and &quot;phyB&quot; are responsible for positive phototropism in roots.

== Biochemistry ==
Chemically, phytochrome consists of a &quot;chromophore&quot;, a single bilin molecule consisting of an open chain of four pyrrole rings, covalently bonded to the protein moiety via highly conserved cysteine amino acid. It is the chromophore that absorbs light, and as a result changes the conformation of bilin and subsequently that of the attached protein, changing it from one state or isoform to the other.

The phytochrome chromophore is usually phytochromobilin, and is closely related to phycocyanobilin (the chromophore of the phycobiliproteins used 
by cyanobacteria and red algae to capture light for photosynthesis) and to the bile pigment bilirubin (whose structure is also affected by light exposure, a fact exploited in the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns).
The term &quot;bili&quot; in all these names refers to bile. Bilins are derived from the closed tetrapyrrole ring of haem by an oxidative reaction catalyzed by haem oxygenase to yield their characteristic open chain. Chlorophyll and haem (Heme) share a common precursor in the form of Protoporphyrin IX, and share the same characteristic closed tetrapyrrole ring structure. In contrast to bilins, haem and chlorophyll carry a metal atom in the center of the ring, iron or magnesium, respectively.

The Pfr state passes on a signal to other biological systems in the cell, such as the mechanisms responsible for gene expression. Although this mechanism is almost certainly a biochemical process, it is still the subject of much debate. It is known that although phytochromes are synthesized in the cytosol and the Pr form is localized there, the Pfr form, when generated by light illumination, is translocated to the cell nucleus. This implies a role of phytochrome in controlling gene expression, and many genes are known to be regulated by phytochrome, but the exact mechanism has still to be fully discovered. It has been proposed that phytochrome, in the Pfr form, may act as a kinase, and it has been demonstrated that phytochrome in the Pfr form can interact directly with transcription factors.

== Discovery ==
The phytochrome pigment was discovered by Sterling Hendricks and Harry Borthwick at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland during a period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Using a spectrograph built from borrowed and war-surplus parts, they discovered that red light was very effective for promoting germination or triggering flowering responses. The red light responses were reversible by far-red light, indicating the presence of a photoreversible pigment.

The phytochrome pigment was identified using a spectrophotometer in 1959 by biophysicist Warren Butler and biochemist Harold Siegelman. Butler was also responsible for the name, phytochrome.

In 1983 the laboratories of Peter Quail and Clark Lagarias reported the chemical purification of the intact phytochrome molecule, and in 1985 the first phytochrome gene sequence was published by Howard Hershey and Peter Quail. By 1989, molecular genetics and work with monoclonal antibodies that more than one type of phytochrome existed; for example, the pea plant was shown to have at least two phytochrome types (then called type I (found predominantly in dark-grown seedlings) and type II (predominant in green plants)). It is now known by genome sequencing that &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; has five phytochrome genes (PHYA - E) but that rice has only three (PHYA - C). While this probably represents the condition in several di- and monocotyledonous plants, many plants are polyploid. Hence maize, for example, has six phytochromes - phyA1, phyA2, phyB1, phyB2, phyC1 and phyC2. While all these phytochromes have significantly different protein components, they all use phytochromobilin as their light-absorbing chromophore. Phytochrome A or phyA is rapidly degraded in the Pfr form - much more so than the other members of the family. In the late 1980s, the Vierstra lab showed that phyA is degraded by the ubiquitin system, the first natural target of the system to be identified in eukaryotes.

In 1996 David Kehoe and Arthur Grossman at the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University identified the proteins, in the filamentous cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon called RcaE with similarly to plant phytochrome that controlled a red-green photoreversible response called chromatic acclimation and identified a gene in the sequenced, published genome of the cyanobacterium &quot;Synechocystis&quot; with closer similarity to those of plant phytochrome. This was the first evidence of phytochromes outside the plant kingdom. Jon Hughes in Berlin and Clark Lagarias at UC Davis subsequently showed that this Synechocystis gene indeed encoded a &quot;bona fide&quot; phytochrome (named Cph1) in the sense that it is a red/far-red reversible chromoprotein. Presumably plant phytochromes are derived from an ancestral cyanobacterial phytochrome, perhaps by gene migration from the chloroplast to the nucleus. Subsequently, phytochromes have been found in other prokaryotes including &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; and &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;. In &quot;Deinococcus&quot; phytochrome regulates the production of light-protective pigments, however in &quot;Synechocystis&quot; and &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; the biological function of these pigments is still unknown.

In 2005, the Vierstra and Forest labs at the University of Wisconsin published a three-dimensional structure of a truncated &quot;Deinococcus&quot; phytochrome (PAS/GAF domains). This paper revealed that the protein chain forms a knot - a highly unusual structure for a protein. In 2008, two groups around Essen and Hughes in Germany and Yang and Moffat in the US published the three-dimensional structures of the entire photosensory domain. One structures was for the &quot;Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803)&quot; phytochrome in Pr and the other one for the &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; phytochrome in the Pfr state. The structures showed that a conserved part of the PHY domain, the so-called PHY tongue, adopts different folds. In 2014 it was confirmed by Takala et al that the refolding occurs even for the same phytochrome (from &quot;Deinococcus)&quot; as a function of illumination conditions.

== Genetic engineering ==
Around 1989, several laboratories were successful in producing &quot;transgenic plants&quot; which produced elevated amounts of different phytochromes (&quot;overexpression&quot;). In all cases the resulting plants had conspicuously short stems and dark green leaves. Harry Smith and co-workers at Leicester University in England showed that by increasing the expression level of phytochrome A (which responds to far-red light), shade avoidance responses can be altered. As a result, plants can expend less energy on growing as tall as possible and have more resources for growing seeds and expanding their root systems. This could have many practical benefits: for example, grass blades that would grow more slowly than regular grass would not require mowing as frequently, or crop plants might transfer more energy to the grain instead of growing taller.

In 2002, the light-induced interaction between a plant phytochrome and phytochrome-interacting factor (PIF) was used to control gene transcription in yeast. This was the first example of using photoproteins from another organism for controlling a biochemical pathway.

<doc id="652210" wikidata="Q1656853" url="?curid=652210" title="Idle Moments">
<text>Idle Moments is an album by American jazz guitarist Grant Green recorded in 1963 and released on the Blue Note label in 1965. It features performances by tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, pianist Duke Pearson, bassist Bob Cranshaw and drummer Al Harewood.

== Recording and music ==
The album is best known for the title piece, a slow composition in C minor which lasts for nearly 15 minutes. Pearson, who wrote the song, explains in his liner notes to the album that the tune was meant to be much shorter. Due to the musicians repeating the main melody twice, however, there was some confusion as to whether or not one chorus would consist of 16 or 32 bars. Producer Alfred Lion was satisfied with the take, although he suggested that they do a retake to fit the song into a seven-minute limit. However, the song had a special feeling to it which no subsequent take could recapture, so it was decided to release the first take on the album. Two other songs, &quot;Jean De Fleur&quot; and &quot;Django&quot;, were re-recorded in shorter renditions to compensate for the length of the title track; the extended renditions of both songs can be heard on the CD re-issues of the album.

== Release ==
&quot;Idle Moments&quot; was released in both stereo and mono in February 1965. On October 23, 2020, Blue Note announced that &quot;Idle Moments&quot; would be reissued as part of their Classic Vinyl Reissue Series with a 180g vinyl pressing. Released on June 11, 2021, the album was remastered by Kevin Gray directly from the original master tapes.

== Reception ==
Steve Huey of &quot;AllMusic&quot; states that Green treats the repertoire of this album &quot;with the graceful elegance that was the hallmark of his best hard bop sessions, and that quality achieves its fullest expression here... &quot;Idle Moments&quot; is the essential first Green purchase, and some of the finest guitar jazz of the hard bop era.&quot; The album was identified by jazz historian and journalist Scott Yanow in his essay &quot;What is Hard Bop?&quot; as one of the &quot;17 Essential Hard Bop Recordings&quot;.

<doc id="652214" wikidata="Q1394879" url="?curid=652214" title="Hung parliament">
<text>A hung parliament is a term used in legislatures primarily under the Westminster system (typically employing majoritarian electoral systems) to describe a situation in which no single political party or pre-existing coalition (also known as an alliance or bloc) has an absolute majority of legislators (commonly known as members or seats) in a parliament or other legislature. This situation is also known as a balanced parliament, or—for local government in the United Kingdom—a parliament under [[no overall control]] (NOC). A hung parliament may result in a coalition government, a minority government, or a snap election if a government cannot be formed.

In multi-party systems, particularly where proportional representation is employed, it is rare for a single party to hold a majority of the seats, and likewise rare for one party to form government on its own (i.e. coalition government is the norm). Consequently, the concept of a &quot;hung parliament&quot; is largely irrelevant in these systems, as a legislature without a single-party majority is the norm.

In the Westminster system, in the absence of a clear majority, no party or coalition has an automatic constitutional entitlement to form government. This can result in the formation of a coalition government of parties which can together command a majority, or the formation of a minority government, where the ruling party receives confidence and supply from smaller parties or independent legislators. Alternatively, in some systems (notably in Canada), a minority government may take office without any majority at all, and work with other parties on a case-by-case basis. If none of these solutions prove workable, the head of state may dissolve parliament, triggering a snap election.

==Overview==
A normal objective of parliamentary systems – especially those requiring responsible government such as the Westminster system – is the formation of a stable government (i.e. ideally one that lasts a full parliamentary term, until the next election would normally be due). This requires a government to be able to muster sufficient votes in parliament to pass motions of confidence and supply, especially motions of no-confidence and budget bills. If such motions fail, they normally result in the dissolution of parliament and a fresh election. In some parliamentary systems, however, a new government may be formed without recourse to an election – if, for example, a minor party holds the balance of power, it may publicly express for the opposition, thereby creating a new majority.

The term &quot;hung parliament&quot; is most often used of parliaments dominated by two major parties or coalitions. General elections in such systems usually result in one party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government. In most parliamentary systems, a hung parliament is considered exceptional and is often seen as undesirable. In other contexts, a hung parliament may be seen as ideal – for example, if opinions among the voting public are polarised regarding one or more issues, a hung parliament may lead to the emergence of a compromise or consensus.

If a legislature is bicameral, the term &quot;hung parliament&quot; is usually used only with respect to the lower house.

In a multi-party system with legislators elected by proportional representation or a similar systems, it is usually exceptionally rare and difficult for any party to have an absolute majority. Under such situations, hung parliaments are often taken for granted and coalition governments are normal. However, the term may be used to describe an election in which no established coalition wins an outright majority (such as the German federal election of 2005 or the 2018 Italian general election).

==History==

The term apparently emerged in the United Kingdom, around the time of the 1974 election, by analogy with a hung jury, that is, one unable to reach a verdict. . However, whereas a hung jury results in a mistrial, requiring a new trial, there is no general rule under which the absence of a clear majority requires a fresh election. In recent years, most &quot;hung parliaments&quot; have served their full term.

===Australia===

Australian parliaments are modelled on the Westminster system, with a hung parliament typically defined as a lack of a lower house parliamentary majority from either the Australian Labor Party or Liberal/National Coalition.

Hung parliaments are rare at the federal level in Australia, as a de facto two-party system, in which the Australian Labor Party competes against a permanent Liberal-National Coalition of the conservative parties, has existed with only brief interruptions since the early 20th century. Prior to 1910, no party had had a majority in the House of Representatives. As a result, there were frequent changes of government, several of which took place during parliamentary terms. Since 1910, when the two-party system was cemented, there have been two hung parliaments, the first in 1940, and the second in 2010. At the 1940 federal election, incumbent Prime Minister Robert Menzies secured the support of the two crossbenchers and continued to govern, but in 1941 the independents switched their support to Labor, bringing John Curtin to power.

Declining support for the major parties in recent times is leading to more non-majoritarian outcomes at elections. At the 2010 federal election, which resulted in an exact 72–72 seat tie between Labor and the Liberal-National Coalition, incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard secured the support of four out of six Independent and Green Party crossbenchers and continued to govern until 2013.

In the 2016 federal election a hung parliament was only narrowly averted with the Liberal-National Coalition winning 76 seats, the bare minimum required to form a majority government. The Liberal-National Coalition government lost its majority government status after a by-election in 2018, but regained its majority in 2019.

Hung parliaments are rather more common at a state level. The Tasmanian House of Assembly and the unicameral Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly are both elected by Hare-Clark proportional representation, thus, elections commonly return hung parliaments. In other states and territories, candidates contest single-member seats. With far fewer seats than federal parliament, hung parliaments are more likely to be elected. Recent examples include New South Wales in 1991 and 2023, Queensland in 1998 and 2015, Victoria in 1999, South Australia in 1997 and 2002, Western Australia in 2008, the Australian Capital Territory in 2008 and 2012 and Tasmania in 2010.

===Canada===

Hung parliaments at either the federal and provincial level are an infrequent but not unusual occurrence in Canada. Five of the previous seven recent federal elections have resulted in hung parliaments (the 38th, the 39th, the 40th, the 43rd, and the 44th). Following all five elections the largest party ruled as a &quot;minority government&quot;. Although Canadian minority governments have tended to be short-lived, the two successive minorities under Prime Minister Stephen Harper managed to hold on to power from February 2006 until a no confidence vote in March 2011. The subsequent election saw a majority parliament elected with Harper&#x27;s Conservative Party obtaining a 24-seat majority.

While most Canadian minority governments end in dissolution via non-confidence or a snap election call, there have been recent attempts to transition to a new government without returning to the ballot box. Most notably, the 2008 Canadian Federal Election resulted in the 2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute. While the Conservative Party had a plurality of seats, the Liberal Party and New Democratic Party, supported by The Bloc Québécois, agreed to defeat the Conservatives in favour of a Liberal/NDP coalition government. On 4 December 2008, Governor General Michaëlle Jean granted Prime Minister Stephen Harper a prorogation on the condition that parliament reconvene early in the new year. The first session of the 40th parliament thus ended, delaying and ultimately avoiding a vote of non-confidence.

At the territorial level, a unique situation happened in the 2021 Yukon general election, in which the electoral district of Vuntut Gwitchin resulted in a tie. A judicial recount was held and the tie remained. A draw was held between the two candidates which ultimately named NDP challenger Annie Blake the winner against incumbent Liberal cabinet minister and MLA Pauline Frost. This victory ultimately resulted in a hung parliament in the Yukon legislature with the NDP holding the balance of power.

===Fiji===
The 2022 Fijian general election resulted in a hung parliament, with no party gaining a majority of seats. Although the FijiFirst party, led by then-Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, won the most seats, the three other parties that won seats (the People&#x27;s Alliance, the National Federation Party and the Social Democratic Liberal Party) formed a coalition and Sitiveni Rabuka, leader of the People&#x27;s Alliance, became the subsequent Prime Minister, ending 16 years of Bainimarama&#x27;s rule.

===France===
Since the establishment of the two-round system for parliamentary elections in 1958, hung parliaments are unusual under the Fifth Republic. Still, 2 general elections out of 16 resulted in such a parliamentary configuration since 1958:

* June 1988 parliamentary elections: after being reelected as President of France in May 1988, François Mitterrand dissolved the National Assembly and called for a snap legislative election on the 5 and 12 June 1988 to regain the majority he lost to a centre-right to right-wing coalition in 1986. The snap election resulted in France&#x27;s first hung parliament since the fall of the Fourth Republic in 1958, with Mitterrand&#x27;s PS as the largest party (275 seats) but 14 short of an overall majority. The Communists and the independent Centrists ended up as potential kingmakers in the newly elected Assembly.

* June 2022 parliamentary elections: less than 2 months after being reelected as president, Emmanuel Macron and his government, now led by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, fought the 2022 legislative election taking place on the 12 and 19 June. In the second round, Macron&#x27;s centrist coalition unexpectedly lost its majority in the National Assembly and was reduced to being the largest bloc (with 251 seats) in a hung parliament. Going into the election with a 115-seat majority, Macron&#x27;s government now fell 38 short of an absolute majority in the lower house of Parliament, the widest margin for any French cabinet since 1958. While both the left-wing NUPES and the far-right RN achieved significant gains, the centre-right to right-wing Republicans were left holding the balance of power in this hung parliament, despite suffering seizable losses.

===India===
India is a federative multi-party parliamentary democracy with lower and upper houses at both national and sub-national levels.

However, despite having a multi-party system in place, it has witnessed a clear majority parliament for 45 years against its transition to democratic republic being 70 years old.

It has 8 recognized national parties with influence over major parts of India and regional parties with bases in certain states.

From 1989 to 2014, India had a continuous period of parliaments producing coalition governments, with clearer majorities for the Indian National Congress and Janata Party before this period and for the Bharatiya Janata Party after it. India returned to the norm of a hung parliament in the 2024 General Elections with both BJP and INC failing to produce majority in it. The confidence of Lok Sabha, lower house of Indian Parliament elected in general elections determines the prime minister and ruling party of India. 

Hung assemblies within states and alliances between national and regional parties at sub-national level are common.

===Ireland===
Because Ireland uses PR-STV, it is rare for any one party to have a majority on its own. The last such occasion was in 1977. However, one or other coalitions are known to be possible before and during the election. Therefore, a &quot;hung Dáil&quot; (Dáil Éireann being the lower and most dominant chamber of the Oireachtas/Parliament) in Ireland refers more to the inability of a coalition of parties who traditionally enter government together or would be expected to govern together, from doing so.

The President has no direct role in the formation of governments in the case of a hung parliament. However, he retains the power to convene a meeting of either or both the Dáil and Senate which could become important if there was a government trying to use parliamentary recess to prevent confidence votes and hold onto power. The President may also refuse to dissolve Dáil Eireann and call an election if the Taoiseach loses a vote of confidence, instead giving the other parties a chance to see if they can put together a government without proceeding to another election.

In 2016, Fine Gael and Labour, who had been in government the previous five years, were unable, due to Labour&#x27;s collapse, to enter government again. Fianna Fáil had enough seats to put together a rainbow government with the other centre-left, hard left parties and independents but negotiations broke down. Fianna Fáil had also promised not to enter coalition with Sinn Féin.

The press began to speculate about a Germany style &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; similar to the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats there. Many members of FF considered FG too right wing to enter coalition with and threatened to leave the party this came to pass. As talks continued on without a new government (the old government, constitutionally, which had just been voted out, remaining in power including ministers who had lost their seats) FF agreed to allow a government to form by abstention. The parliamentary arithmetic fell in such a way that if FF TD&#x27;s abstained on confidence and supply matters, a FG minority government could, with the support of a group of independents, form a new government. This was agreed in exchange for a number of policy concessions. Once the deal with FF was signed, Taoiseach Enda Kenny conducted talks with the independents and entered government for a second term.

===Israel===

All parliamentary elections in Israel have resulted in hung parliaments. The Knesset consists of 120 members and the highest number of seats a single faction has ever received was the 56 members Alignment (&quot;Ma&#x27;arach&quot;) got in the October 1969 elections. When the same faction was formed in January 1969 it consisted of 63 members, the only instance to date of a faction with an absolute majority in the Knesset. The lowest number of seats the largest faction has ever received in a Knesset election was 26 members received by One Israel in the 1999 Israeli general election.

===Malaysia===
The 2022 general election of Malaysia resulted in a hung parliament with no party or party coalition winning a simple majority for the first time in Malaysian history. Following five days of deliberation and negotiations within coalitions and parties, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia swore in Pakatan Harapan (PH) chairman Anwar Ibrahim, whose coalition won the most seats, as the tenth Prime Minister of Malaysia on 24 November 2022. To achieve a parliamentary majority, Pakatan Harapan formed a grand coalition government with Barisan Nasional (BN), Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) and various independent parties.

===New Zealand===

Hung parliaments were relatively uncommon in New Zealand prior to the introduction of proportional representation in 1993. On only four occasions since the beginnings of party politics in 1890 had a hung parliament occurred under the first-past-the-post system: in 1911, 1922, 1928 and 1931. The rarity between 1936 and 1996 was due to the regression into a two-party system, alternating between the long dominating New Zealand Labour Party and New Zealand National Party. From the first MMP election in 1996 until the 2020 election no single party gained an outright majority in parliament. The 2020 election was the first to return a majority – a narrow majority for the Labour Party – since 1993.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed for generations; traditionally, only the Tories and Whigs, or from the mid-19th century the Conservative and Liberal parties, managed to deliver Members of Parliament in significant numbers. Hung parliaments were thus rare, especially during the 19th century. The possibility of change arose when, in the aftermath of the Act of Union, 1800, a number of Irish MPs took seats in the House, though initially these followed the traditional alignments. However, two Reform Acts (in 1867 and in 1884) significantly extended the franchise and redrew the constituencies, and coincided with a change in Irish politics. Following the 1885 general election, neither party had an overall majority. The Irish Parliamentary Party held the balance of power and made Irish Home Rule a condition of their support. However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule, leading to another general election in 1886, in which the Conservatives won the most seats and governed with the support of the fragment of Liberalism opposed to Home Rule, the Liberal Unionist Party.

Both the election of January 1910, and that of December 1910 produced a hung parliament with an almost identical number of seats won by the governing Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This was due both to the constitutional crisis and to the rise of the Labour Party. The elections of 1929 resulted in the last hung parliament for many years; in the meantime, Labour had replaced the Liberals as one of the two dominating parties.

Since the elections of 1929, three general elections have resulted in hung parliaments in the UK. The first was the election in February 1974, and the ensuing parliament lasted only until October. The second was the May 2010 election, the result of which was a hung parliament with the Conservative party as the largest single party. The results for the 3 main parties were: Conservatives 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57. The third one resulted from the snap election held in June 2017 that had been called for by Theresa May in order to strengthen her majority heading into Brexit negotiations later in 2017. However, this election backfired on May and her Conservative Party, resulting in a hung parliament after the snap election.

The formation of the coalition resulting from the 2010 election led to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which instituted fixed five-year Parliaments and transferred the power to call early elections from the Prime Minister to Parliament itself. This was the idea of the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, then the leader of the Liberal Democrats, who said that this would stop the Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, from calling a snap election to end the hung parliament, as many other Conservatives had requested.

Hung parliaments can also arise when slim government majorities are eroded by by-election defeats and defection of Members of Parliament to opposition parties, as well as resignations of MPs from the House of Commons. This happened in December 1996 to the Conservative government of John Major (1990–97) and in mid-1978 to the Labour government of James Callaghan (1976–79); this latter period covers the era known as the Winter of Discontent. The minority government of Jim Callaghan came when Labour ended their 15-month Lib–Lab pact with the Liberals, having lost their majority in early 1977.

According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart Wilks-Heeg, the phrase &quot;hung parliament&quot; did not enter into common usage in the UK until the mid-1970s. It was first used in the press by journalist Simon Hoggart in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1974.

Academic treatments of hung parliaments include David Butler&#x27;s &quot;Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain&quot; (Sheridan House, 1986) and Vernon Bogdanor&#x27;s &#x27;Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution&#x27; (Cambridge University Press, 1983).

==Consequences==
In countries where parliaments under majority control are the norm, a hung parliament is often viewed as an unusual and undesirable election result, leading to relatively weak and unstable government. A period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders negotiate with independents and minor parties to establish a working majority.

An aspiring head of government may seek to build a coalition government; in Westminster systems, this typically involves agreement on a joint legislative programme and a number of ministerial posts going to the minor coalition partners, in return for a stable majority. Alternatively, a minority government may be formed, establishing confidence and supply agreements in return for policy concessions agreed in advance, or relying on case by case support.

===Australia===
In the Western Australian state election of 2008 the Australian Labor Party won more seats than the Liberal Party at 28 to 24. The National Party along with three independents had the seats needed to give either party a majority. To help the Liberal Party form government, the Nationals supported the party on the condition that the Royalties for Regions policy was implemented.

In the 1999 Victorian state election, the Labor Party won 42 seats, while the incumbent Liberal National Coalition retained 43, with 3 seats falling to independents. The Labor Party formed a minority government with the 3 independents.

The 2010 Tasmanian state election resulted in a hung parliament. After a period of negotiation, the incumbent Labor government led by David Bartlett was recommissioned, but containing the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens, Nick McKim, as a minister, and the Greens&#x27; Cassy O&#x27;Connor as Cabinet Secretary.

In the 2010 federal election, neither Labor nor the Liberal coalition secured the majority of seats required to form a Government in their own right. In order to counter the potential instability of minority government involved groups may negotiate written agreements defining their terms of support. Such measures were undertaken by the Gillard Government in 2010.

===France===
In the 1988 French legislative elections, a hung parliament occurred with the Socialists as the largest party. Following talks with parliamentary leaders, Prime Minister Michel Rocard formed a new minority government, incorporating centrist ministers in a sort of unofficial coalition with the pivotal independent centrist group in the Assembly, ensuring a somewhat stable government until 1991. His direct successors, Prime Ministers Édith Cresson and Pierre Bérégovoy, both formed minority governments, relying alternately on the Communists&#x27; or the Centrists&#x27; support in Parliament (depending on the issue).

In the 2022 French legislative elections, a hung parliament occurred again with President Macron&#x27;s Ensemble coalition as the largest bloc in the National Assembly. Both the President and the Prime Minister held talks with opposition leaders in order to try forming a coalition government with the centre-right (LR) and the centre-left (PS and the Greens), or at least reaching some sort of confidence-and-supply deal with them. Talks rapidly failed since no opposition party showed interest in propelling Macron&#x27;s administration. In July 2022, Prime Minister Borne reshuffled her Cabinet and officially formed a minority government. As of June 2023, it is still the current government of France.

===India===
In India, if an election results in a &#x27;hung assembly&#x27; in one of the state Legislative Assemblies and no party is capable of gaining confidence, then fresh elections are announced to be held as soon as possible. Until this occurs President&#x27;s Rule is applied. In India there have been many situations of hung assemblies in the state legislatures. However, invariably, the President of India in the case of Lok Sabha elections and the Governor of the state concerned, in the case of state elections, would attempt to give opportunities to the parties, starting with the one that got the maximum number of seats in the elections, to explore possibilities of forming a coalition government, before bringing in President&#x27;s Rule.

===New Zealand===
The first such occasion was in 1911 when the Liberal Party won fewer seats than the opposition Reform Party despite tallying the most votes. A vote of no confidence was placed by Reform and the Liberals survived by just one vote. This prompted Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward to resign, his replacement Thomas Mackenzie was later defeated in July 1912 in a vote with several MPs and Labour crossing the floor to vote with the opposition, the last time in New Zealand history a government has changed on a confidence vote. This broke 23 years of Liberal governance and William Massey formed a new Reform Party government. Massey governed through to his death in 1925, though in 1922 the Reform Party suffered major losses and Massey was forced negotiate with several Independent MPs to retain power.

In 1928, Reform were ousted from governance and Joseph Ward once again won back power. However, the Reform and United (Liberal) parties were tied on seats with Labour holding the balance of power. Labour chose to back Ward rather than let Reform leader Gordon Coates remain in office. In the next election in 1931, there was again a three-way deadlock. On this occasion the Reform and United parties became a coalition government out of mutual fear of Labour&#x27;s ever-increasing appeal as the Great Depression worsened.

1993 was the last time a hung parliament occurred in New Zealand. Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard asked Sir David Beattie to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as Prime Minister. 
 However, National won an extra seat after special votes were counted, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats (4 were won by third-party candidates). Labour&#x27;s Sir Peter Tapsell agreed to become Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. As a result, National did not lose a vote in the house and maintained a dubious majority for three years.

===United Kingdom===
In the February 1974 general election, no party gained an overall parliamentary majority. Labour won the most seats (301, which was 17 seats short of an overall majority) with the Conservatives on 297 seats, although the Conservatives had a larger share of the popular vote. As the incumbent Prime Minister, Edward Heath remained in office attempting to build a coalition with the Liberals. When these negotiations were unsuccessful Heath resigned and Labour led by Harold Wilson took over in a minority government.

In the 2010 UK general election, another hung parliament occurred with the Conservatives as the largest party, and discussions followed to help create a stable government. This resulted in agreement on a coalition government, which was also a majority government, between the Conservative Party, which won the most votes and seats in the election, and the Liberal Democrats.

In the 2017 UK general election, a hung parliament occurred for the second time in seven years with the Conservatives again being the largest party. The Conservatives led by Theresa May formed a minority government, supported by a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Northern Ireland&#x27;s Democratic Unionist Party.

==Working majority==
There have been occasions when, although a parliament or assembly is technically hung, the party in power has a working majority. For example, in the United Kingdom, the tradition is that the Speaker and Deputy Speakers do not vote and Sinn Féin MPs never take their seats per their policy of abstentionism, so these members can be discounted from the opposition numbers.

===United Kingdom===
In 2005, this was the case in the 60-seat National Assembly for Wales, where Labour lost their majority when Peter Law was expelled for standing against the official candidate in the 2005 Westminster election in the Blaenau Gwent constituency. When the Assembly was first elected on 1 May 2003, Labour won 30 seats, Plaid Cymru won 12, the Conservatives won 11, Liberal Democrats won 6, and the John Marek Independent Party won a seat.

When Dafydd Elis-Thomas (Plaid Cymru) was reelected as the presiding officer, this reduced the number of opposition AMs who could vote to 29, as the presiding officer votes only in the event of a tie and, even then, not on party political lines but according to Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule. Thus, Labour had a working majority of one seat until Law ran in Blaenau Gwent.

<doc id="652221" wikidata="Q1615791" url="?curid=652221" title="Whitefield, Greater Manchester">
<text>Whitefield is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, Greater Manchester, England. It lies on undulating ground above the Irwell Valley, along the south bank of the River Irwell, southeast of Bury, and northwest of Manchester. Prestwich and the M60 motorway lie just to the south. In 2001 it had a population of 23,283.

Historically part of Lancashire, Whitefield was on the path of an ancient Roman road leading from &quot;Mamucium&quot; (Manchester) in the south to &quot;Bremetennacum&quot; (Ribchester) in the north. Throughout the Middle Ages, Whitefield was a division of the township of Pilkington, itself a part of the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham and hundred of Salford. Pilkington and Whitefield have historic associations with the Earls of Derby. Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.

The urbanisation and development of Whitefield largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution. The name Whitefield is thought to derive from the medieval bleachfields used by Flemish settlers to whiten their woven fabrics, or else from the wheat crop once cultivated in the district. The construction of a major roads routed through the village facilitated Whitefield&#x27;s expansion into a mill town by the mid-19th century. Whitefield became a local government district in 1866, and was governed by a local board of health until 1894, when the area of the local board became an urban district.

==History==

===Toponymy===
There are several theories for the origin of the place name, discussed in two local history publications. One, published in John Wilson&#x27;s &quot;A History of Whitefield (1979)&quot;, is that the name is derived from the Flemish weavers who used to lay out their fabrics to bleach in the sun (a process known as tentering). Although Wilson doubts this, believing it to be chronologically inaccurate, another theory relies on the fact that historically, Whitefield has been a farming community of open fields, and that the name is a corruption of &quot;Wheat-fields&quot;. A third is that the name refers to a field of white flowers, evidenced by the existence of the area of Lily Hill Street.

In &quot;Remains, Historical and Literary, Connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester (1861)&quot;, the will of a John Rhodes describes leaving ownership of land in &quot;Whitefield Moore&quot; in Pilkington, to his son.

===Early history===
In Elizabethan times, Whitefield was mostly moorland and until the 19th century existed, along with the districts of Ringley, Unsworth and Outwood, as part of the Manor of Pilkington. In the 15th century the Pilkington family who, during the Wars of the Roses, supported the House of York, owned much of the land around the parish. Thomas Pilkington was at this time lord of many estates in Lancashire including the Manor of Bury. In 1485 Richard III was killed in the Battle of Bosworth. The Earl of Richmond, representing the House of Lancaster, was crowned Henry VII. Sir William Stanley may have placed the crown upon his head. As a reward for the support of his family, on 27 October 1485 Henry made Thomas Stanley the Earl of Derby. Thomas Pilkington was attainted, and in February 1489 Earl Thomas was given many confiscated estates including those of Pilkington, which included the township of Pilkington, and Bury. With their seat at Knowsley Hall, the Earls of Derby were by and large absentee landlords who appointed agents to manage their interests in the area, unlike the Earls of Wilton whose lands at Prestwich bordered the area and who oversaw events on their estate and dispensed charity from Heaton Hall.

Over the centuries, hamlets grew at Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn, Lily Hill, Four Lane Ends (now the junction around Moss Lane and Pinfold Lane), Stand and Park Gate (now the junction around Park Lane and Pinfold Lane). These now form the area known as Whitefield. Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn was for some time known as Stone Pale and a small street of that name still exists.

==Governance==

Whitefield was in 1853 a part of the township of Pilkington, in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham. Pilkington ceased to be a township in 1894 and at the same time part of the old boundary of Whitefield was absorbed by Radcliffe. The realignment of the boundary with Radcliffe was due to the location of the Whitefield sewage works, which lying between Hillock and Parr Lane were in the wrong place to serve the Stand Lane area. Whitefield had gained a local board in 1866, but after the dissolution of Pilkington township in 1894, Whitefield became an urban district with two wards, in the administrative county of Lancashire.

Whitefield Town Hall was established in 1933 with the purchase of the house previously known as Underley, along with of surrounding land. Before this the council chambers had been on Elms Street. On 1 April 1974 Whitefield became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

==Geography==

At (53.552°, −2.299°), Whitefield lies on the west side of the conjunction of the M60 and M66 motorways, and south of the River Irwell. The larger towns of Bury and Middleton lie to the north and east respectively. For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Whitefield forms part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, with Manchester city centre itself south-southeast of Whitefield.

Localities within Whitefield include Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn, Hillock, Lily Hill, Park Lane, Stand and to the south of the M60 motorway and separated by it from the rest of the township is Kirkhams.

The area has three medium-sized council housing estates (Hillock Estate, Elms Estate and Victoria Estate) which originally consisted of only council-owned properties. The Elms estate began to be constructed in the 1920s and was completed in the 1950s, whilst the Hillock estate was conceived in the 1950s as an overspill estate for 8,000 people rehoused from the City of Manchester ward of Bradford, and Beswick, which were at the time undergoing housing clearances. All three estates now include privately owned properties bought from council ownership under right-to-buy schemes, with the remainder at the Elms and Victoria managed by Six Town Housing, an arms-length management organisation (ALMO) set up by the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, and at Hillock by Rivers Housing. Hillock is an attractive estate, and is often regarded as the most successful of all Manchester Corporation&#x27;s many overspill developments.

Much of the area is made up of middle class suburban commuter developments, with some attractive older terraced housing too, especially around Lily Hill Street and Nipper Lane, and it also encompasses an area of larger properties surrounding Ringley Road and Park Lane. In recent years the area has seen new construction work on infill sites.

==Demography==
In 2001, a census was taken of the United Kingdom, recording such details as people&#x27;s age, ethnicity and religion. According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the census Whitefield had a population of 23,283. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 91.3 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 28.8% were single (never married) 44.6% married, and 8.4% divorced. Whitefield&#x27;s 9,849 households included 29.8% one-person, 36.8% married couples living together, 8.3% were co-habiting couples, and 11.4% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 30.2% had no academic qualifications.

As of the 2001 UK census, 74.3% of Whitefield&#x27;s residents reported themselves as being Christian, 6.0% Jewish, 1.6% Muslim, 0.6% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist and 0.1% Sikh. The census recorded 10.3% as having no religion, 0.1% had an alternative religion and 6.9% did not state their religion.

===Population change===
Wilson, whilst not providing references to his own research, reports that the Hearth Tax Returns for Whitefield in 1666 show that there were 135 hearths. Further, that the population numbered in 1714 a total of 740; that in 1789 it was 2,455; and in 1793 that it was 2,780. Some of the population statistics which he quotes subsequently in his book, and presumably based upon the Official Census returns since 1901, do on occasion differ very slightly from those quoted below.

==Economy==
In 1906 the following textile bleaching, dyeing and finishing businesses existed in Whitefield: John Brierley (at Spring Clough); W.E. Buckley &amp; Co Ltd (Hollins Vale); R.&amp; A. Chambers Ltd (Spring Waters); Thomas L. Livesey Ltd (Hollins Vale); Mark Fletcher &amp; Sons Ltd (Moss Lane Mills, having been founded in Little Lever in 1854); William Hampson (Besses); Kilner Croft Dyeing Co Ltd (Unsworth); Whitefield Velvet &amp; Cord Dyeing Co Ltd (Crow Oak Works); and Philip Worrall (Hollins Vale).

At the same time there were five cotton manufacturers in the area: J.G. Clayton and Nelson, Greenhalgh &amp; Co (both at Albert Mills, on what was then Workhouse Lane); Lord, Frears &amp; Bro. (Whitefield New Mill); Francis Mather (Whitefield Mill); and Worthington &amp; Co (Victoria Mills, Unsworth). There were also two smallware manufacturers in the area, being Prestwich Smallware Co (on Hardmans Green, Besses) and the Victoria Smallware Co on Narrow Lane. There were also at least two firms in the building trade: John Jackson &amp; Son, builder and joiners, on Livesey Street; and F.M. &amp; H. Nuttall, builders and stonemasons, who were on Moss Lane and later had their stoneyard adjoining the west side of Whitefield railway station.

Whitefield&#x27;s proximity to the M60 orbital motorway and city of Manchester has ensured that there are many small businesses and trading estates located locally. Whitefield has experienced several new commercial developments since the turn of the 21st century, for example with the replacement of Elms Shopping Precinct by a new gym and several new outlets and with a new Morrisons supermarket built in 2008 on land previously occupied by a public house, the bus station and a former retail premises.

There used to be sweet factory on Stanley Road – Hall&#x27;s, then arguably most famous for their &quot;Mentho-Lyptus&quot; product, sometimes spelled Menthol Lyptus – and there still is a large flooring company, Polyflor, in the Radcliffe New Road area.

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents of Whitefield aged 16–74 was 18.9% retail and wholesale, 13.7% manufacturing, 12.2% health and social work, 11.9% property and business services, 8.2% transport and communications, 7.6% education, 6.5% construction, 5.5% finance, 5.4 public administration, 4.3% hotels and restaurants, 0.7% energy and water supply, 0.5% agriculture, 0.1% mining and 4.7% other. Compared with national figures, the town had a relatively high proportion of people working in finance, and low levels of people working in agriculture. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 2.1% students were with jobs, 3.2% students without jobs, 5.4% looking after home or family, 7.2% permanently sick or disabled and 3.0% economically inactive for other reasons.

==Transport==
Public transport began some time in the early 19th century and in 1817 there were coach services being run through Whitefield between Manchester and Bury along Bury Old Road, which had been constructed in 1755. However, Wilson speculates that these were probably mainly for freight and states that the Coach &amp; Horses public house at Kirkhams was the coaching inn.

Bury New Road –a turnpike road, taking an alternative route between Bury and Manchester – was constructed in 1827. Toll bars for this newly constructed road were built at Kersal Bar, Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn, Stand Lane and Blackford Bridge.

In the 1860s and 1870s transport between Whitefield and Manchester consisted of a four-horse bus running at hourly intervals, with local passenger stops at the Bay Horse Inn at Chapelfield and at the Church Inn in the centre of the town. The firm which operated this service was called Turner, after which Turner Street was named.

The Bury, Oldham and Rochdale Tramways Company operated a service of trams pulled by a steam engine from 1883. These ran until the end of the century between Bury and Kersal Bar, when they were replaced by electric trams leased by Salford Corporation between Bury and Manchester along both Bury Old Road and Bury New Road. The lease expired in 1926 and the trams between Whitefield and Manchester were then replaced by buses, also operated by Salford Corporation. In the same year, Bury Corporation provided buses to operate from Whitefield to Bury. A bus station, now demolished, was opened in 1931 just set back from the junction of Stanley Road and Bury New Road, behind the then Church Inn.

In the 1920s the evening trams from Whitefield and Manchester had a letterbox fitted to their fronts, enabling letters to be posted at the tram stops in time to reach the last post collection at Manchester post sorting office.

By 1905 electric trams were also running between Whitefield and Radcliffe along Radcliffe New Road.

On 18 July 1872 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) gained an Act of Parliament to construct a railway between Manchester and Bury, via Whitefield and Prestwich. This opened in 1879 with a new station, known as Whitefield railway station. The L&amp;YR line was electrified in 1916 for which a power station was constructed near the Manchester, Bolton &amp; Bury Canal at nearby Clifton, with substations at Radcliffe and at Victoria Station, Manchester. Electrification reduced the journey times between Manchester and Bury from 32 minutes to 24. The line is now used by the Metrolink, upon which services commenced on 6 April 1992. A station at nearby Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn also serves the area, having been opened on 1 February 1933.

All public transport is supervised by Transport for Greater Manchester.

==Religion==
The Five Mile Act 1665 had made it an offence punishable by transportation for more than five people to congregate for worship other than in the manner prescribed by the Church of England, and for any nonconformist to minister within five miles (8 km) of any parish of which he had been a parson. The area of Stand was six miles (10 km) from Manchester, from Bolton and from Bury, which made it a suitable point at which nonconformists could legally meet. The specific catalyst for the meetings appears to have been the ejection of Thomas Pike from the living of Radcliffe due to his Puritan leanings; though he went to Blackley, those who agreed with his leanings began to meet at Stand, most probably at Old Hall, the house of Thomas Sergeant, after the family of whom the present Sergeant&#x27;s Lane is named. By 1672 a barn belonging to William Walker had been licensed for preaching and in 1693 the Rev. Robert Easton, ejected Minister of Daresbury, near Warrington, became the first Minister of Stand Chapel. The building had been erected in that year on land obtained from the Trustees of Stand Grammar School and, indeed, the school was held in the chapel on weekdays.

Whilst preaching the nonconformist position, Stand Chapel was not at this time Unitarian. The transition to Unitarianism was gradual, being completed in 1789 when the Rev. R. Aubrey determined to follow the doctrine (it was in fact illegal to call oneself a Unitarian until 1813). This doctrinal decision caused a split, with some of the congregation leaving to form Stand Independent Chapel on Stand Lane.

Stand Unitarian Chapel was demolished and another built, capable of seating 400, in 1818.

Stand All Saints&#x27; CofE Church, which was a so-called &#x27;Waterloo Church&#x27;, having been built to celebrate Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, is located just outside the town centre. The site was given by the Earl of Derby and the first stone laid by the Earl of Wilton on 3 August 1822. Consecrated on 8 September 1826 by Dr Blomfield, Bishop of Chester, it was designed by Sir Charles Barry in the Gothic style of the 14th century. The tower is in height. The cost of the building was £14,987. A clock was added to the tower in 1832 and then replaced in 1906. The church forms the centrepiece of the All Saints&#x27; conservation area, designated by the local council in March 2004.

Roman Catholics were of sufficient number by 1952 that they rented a room at the Liberal Club building, which was at that time on Morley Street; subsequently, in 1956, St Bernadette&#x27;s Church was built on Manchester Road as their place of worship. The building cost £22,446 and the foundation stone was laid on 26 March 1955; although the stone bears the name of Bishop H.V. Marshall it was in fact laid by the Vicar General, Monsignor J. Cunningham, due to the illness of the former.

A few years later, and next door to St Bernadette&#x27;s, a meetinghouse of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was erected.

Other places of worship in the area include the New Jerusalem Church on Charles Street (there is another on Stand Lane), Whitefield Methodist Chapel, Besses United Reformed Church, two synagogues and a spiritualist church.

Whitefield Hebrew Congregation was built on land purchased from the Church of England, where originally a Church of England school had stood and which was demolished for the construction of the present synagogue.

In August 2010 it was reported that a planning application had been submitted to the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, on behalf of the Whitefield Hebrew Congregation, for the creation of a symbolic boundary, known as an eruv, around of Whitefield. The construction of the eruv would allow the 700 Orthodox Jewish families living in the area to carry out activities normally prohibited on the Hebrew shabbat (sabbath), such as carrying keys, pushing prams and using wheelchairs. Similar eruvim have already been created in a number of cities such as New York City, Antwerp and London. The Whitefield eruv would be the first to be constructed in the United Kingdom outside London.

==Culture, education media and sport==
One local newspaper that covers the area of Whitefield (as well as neighbouring Prestwich and Radcliffe) is the Advertiser, (one of the GMWN Greater Manchester Weekly News newspapers) a weekly freesheet based in Salford. The other local paper (not distributed freely, door to door) is the Prestwich and Whitefield Guide.

Sedgley Park R.U.F.C. play their home matches at their Park Lane ground, and were in National Division One until the end of the 2008–09 season.

Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn Band, and subsequently its associated boys&#x27; band, has existed in the area since at least 1818, at which time it had converted from a string band to a reed band. Its founders were John, James and Joseph Clegg – three brothers who were manufacturers of cotton products at Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn – and for this reason it was for a time known as Clegg&#x27;s Reed Band. Originally using a room called the mangle room, attached to the old barn at Besses which was pulled down in the 1880s, it has had its headquarters on Moss Lane since 1884. At the peak of its fame in the early 1900s this band, by now using brass instruments, undertook numerous prestigious engagements, including world tours lasting well in excess of 12 months at a time.

Whitefield is the birthplace of Dodie Smith, author of the novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;.

==Public services==
Whitefield&#x27;s gas supply was originally made by the Radcliffe and Pilkington Gas Company, which had been founded in 1864. This was purchased in 1921 by the Radcliffe and Little Lever Joint Gas Board. Gas was used by businesses, homes and also for street lighting.

Around 1883 Thomas Thorp established an engineering business in Victoria Lane, complete with an astronomical observatory on its roof for his own use. He invented the penny-in-the-slot gas meter.

<doc id="652223" wikidata="Q2710909" url="?curid=652223" title="Phoebis sennae">
<text>Phoebis sennae, the cloudless sulphur, is a mid-sized butterfly in the family Pieridae found in the Americas. There are several similar species such as the clouded sulphur (&quot;Colias philodice&quot;), the yellow angled-sulphur (&quot;Anteos maerula&quot;), which has angled wings, the statira sulphur (&quot;Aphrissa statira),&quot; and other sulphurs, which are much smaller. The species name comes from the genus &quot;Senna&quot; to which many of the larval host plants belong.

==Distribution==
Their range is wide, from South America to southern Canada, in particular southwestern Ontario. They are most common from Argentina to southern Texas, Georgia, and Florida, but are often visitors outside this range becoming more rare further north.
==Habitat==
The common habitats of this butterfly are open spaces, gardens, glades, seashores, and watercourses.

==Diet==
The adult butterfly feeds on nectar from many different flowers with long tubes including cordia, bougainvillea, cardinal flower, hibiscus, lantana, and wild morning glory. The larvae also feed on sennas and partridge peas.

&quot;Senna hebecarpa&quot; (American senna) is a larval host and nectar source for the cloudless sulphur butterfly in the Eastern United States.

==Life cycle==
The breeding season is dependent on the climate of the area, from midsummer to fall in the cooler areas, to year-round where the climate is warmer.

===Egg===
The cloudless sulphur starts off as a pitcher-shaped white egg. Eventually it will turn to a pale orange. The egg stage lasts six days.

===Caterpillar===

Once the egg hatches, a caterpillar emerges that is yellow to greenish, striped on sides, with black dots in rows across the back. The host plant may be sensitive peas (&quot;Chamaecrista&quot;), sennas (&quot;Senna&quot;), clovers (&quot;Trifolium&quot;), or other legumes (&quot;Fabaceae&quot;). The caterpillar will usually grow to a length between .

===Chrysalis===
The caterpillar will form a chrysalis that is pointed at both ends and humped in the middle. The chrysalis will be either yellow or green with pink or green stripes. From the chrysalis comes a medium-sized butterfly () with fairly elongated but not angled wings.

===Adult===
The male butterfly is clear yellow above and yellow or mottled with reddish brown below and the female is lemon yellow to golden or white on both surfaces, with varying amounts of black spotting along the margin and a black open square or star on the bottom forewing. Wing spans range from 4.8 to 6.5 cm (approximately 1.9

to 2.6 in).

<text>Christchurch Mansion is a substantial Tudor brick mansion house built in Ipswich, Suffolk, England, by Edmund Withypoll (also written &quot;Withipoll&quot;) around 1548–1550. The Grade I listed building is located within Christchurch Park and sits by the southern gates close to the town centre of Ipswich. The mansion belonged to various noble families throughout its history but was purchased by the Ipswich Borough Council in 1884. Since 1885, the building has been used as a museum and is today run by the municipally run Colchester and Ipswich Museums Service (CIMS) organisation. The museum&#x27;s rooms are preserved as past inhabitants would have known them, complete with original items such as furniture, fine clothing and children&#x27;s toys. The museum also holds a collection of paintings by renowned local artists including John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough. The Mansion is free to enter and booking is not required.

==History==
Christchurch Park was originally the grounds of the Priory of the Holy Trinity, with an area of many square miles, coming up to the medieval town walls. During Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries, the monastery was dissolved and the land was purchased by Paul Withypoll, Master Merchant Taylor and Merchant Adventurer, who died in 1547. Upon the manor, known as Christ Church Withipoll, his son and heir Edmund Withypoll built Withipoll House in 1548–50, the ground floor masonry of which remains, although refurbished internally under subsequent owners. A survival from the original is the house&#x27;s Latin motto, on a stone dated 1549:&quot;Frugalitatem sic servas, ut dissipationem non incurras.&quot; His granddaughter Elizabeth Withypoll married Leicester Devereux, 6th Viscount Hereford and the mansion passed to the Devereux family, who rebuilt the upper floors after a fire in about 1670, when the main porch was also added. In 1734, Claude Fonnereau purchased the mansion from Price Devereux, 10th Viscount Hereford. A street next to the park is named after the family.

W.C. Fonnereau in 1848 laid out and developed Fonnereau Road as a superior residential area. In 1894 the mansion was bought by Felix Cobbold from a syndicate of property developments, to save the building from demolition. Cobbold, a wealthy local businessman and philanthropist, then offered to give it to the Ipswich Corporation to establish a Museum and Art Gallery, together with a further £20,000 (equivalent to £ in ) in Ipswich Stock for the purchase of artworks. His offer was on condition that the Corporation buy the surrounding parkland for the people of Ipswich. It took Cobbold three attempts to get the corporation to agree to this, but in February 1895 the mansion was transferred to the town and in April 1895 the Corporation purchased the central part of the park. The corporation acquired the Upper Arboretum (laid out for public use in 1848) in 1928. Felix Cobbold, among other members of the wealthy Cobbold family, have donated a great deal of land to the people of Ipswich, including the former Ipswich Racecourse.
The restoration of the Mansion for its public opening was the work of the Ipswich architect John Shewell Corder, and its redevelopment as a Museum was undertaken by Frank Woolnough, Curator of the Ipswich Corporation Museum 1893–1920. Woolnough, an active member of the Museums Association and of the Savage Club, also developed its use as a venue for annual meetings of various Societies, and for educational purposes. During this time it was also the home of the archaeological galleries of Miss Nina Layard, over which she had honorary curatorship. Under curator Guy Maynard (1920–1952) the enlargement of the fine and decorative art and furniture collections continued. The Thomas Gainsborough Bicentenary Exhibition of 1927, including also works by George Frost and John Constable, showcased the mansion as the home of a collection of national importance. The structure was further enlarged with the addition of the new Wolsey Art Gallery at the rear, and an entire two-storey wing rescued in 1924 from the demolition of a Tudor merchant&#x27;s house.

In 2019, the museum hosted Made in Suffolk, an exclusive exhibition dedicated to the Suffolk global superstar Ed Sheeran. It featured many personal items of Ed Sheeran throughout his journey to stardom, including personal sketches, written song lyrics, school reports and famed awards trophies from the Brit Awards and Grammys.

==Notable works==
*Lady Drury&#x27;s Closet
*&quot;Golding Constable&#x27;s Flower Garden&quot; and &quot;Golding Constable&#x27;s Kitchen Garden&quot;
*A collection of seventy-seven pastels by Blanche Georgiana Vulliamy of First World War searchlights

<text>The Anglican Church of Korea (or Episcopal Church of Korea) is the province of the Anglican Communion in North and South Korea. Founded in 1889, it has over 120 parish and mission churches with a total membership of roughly 65,000 people.

==History==

===Birth of the Anglican Church of Korea===

The Anglican Church of Korea can be traced back to November 1, 1889, when Bishop Charles John Corfe was ordained at Westminster Abbey and inaugurated as the first diocesan bishop of Joseon (Korea). With his colleagues who had been invited to join the mission, he arrived in Incheon Port on 29 September 1890. which is the first Anglican Church in Korea was established by him and Eli Barr Landis (1865–1898) on September 30, 1891 at Nae-dong, Jung-gu, Incheon. He initiated his work in the Seoul area, including Gyeonggi and Chungcheong provinces. He first opened a number of educational institutions, medical facilities and social work centers across the country, such as the Sinmyeong (Faith and Enlightenment) schools and the hospitals in the vicinities of Incheon, Yeoju and Jincheon as well as orphanages in Suwon and Anjung. The Anglican missionaries also sought possible ways for the church to be integrated into Korean culture. As a result of that effort, there are several Anglican Church buildings which were constructed in the traditional Korean architecture and which survive today such as Ganghwa Anglican Cathedral. In addition, the early missionaries made pioneering contributions to Korean studies.

=== Early missionary work ===
Beginning in 1923 mission work was carried out in the northern part of the peninsula such as Pyongan and Hwanghae Provinces. To train the local clergy St. Michael&#x27;s Theological Institute, the former institution of the present Sungkonghoe University, was established in 1923, followed by the Society of the Holy Cross (convent) in 1925. Also, the Cathedral Church of St. Mary the Virgin and St. Nicholas in downtown Seoul was constructed in 1924 and is known for its Romanesque architecture as it is the only one in this fashion in the orient, together with its mosaic murals.

===Japanese colonial rule===
Due to considerable difficulties with the language barrier, personal health problems, and other incidents, the mission work had little success throughout the later years, especially during the 36-year period of Japanese colonial rule. This colonial rule caused significant obstacles to Church development in Korea, primarily because those missionaries appeared to have an indifferent attitude to the Korean independence movement at that time.

=== First native bishop ===

Despite such an unfavorable situation as illustrated, the first native Korean bishop, Cheon-hwan Lee, was ordained in 1965 after 20 years had lapsed since liberation from Japanese rule. Thus the original Korean mission diocese was formed into the two dioceses of Seoul and Daejeon, followed by the separate additional forming of the Diocese of Busan in 1974. In 1974, he received an honorary CBE from Queen Elizabeth II. He died on 26 March 2010.

=== Recent expansion ===
Since the 1970s the Anglican Church has expanded through opening a number of new churches across country. St Peter&#x27;s School was founded in 1975 to provide special needs children with effective special education as needed. St. Michael&#x27;s Theological Seminary was also upgraded to be accredited by the government in 1982 and 10 years later it was again upgraded and expanded as a university to satisfies the peoples&#x27; great needs in the coming new era.

The three dioceses continued steady growth in numbers of churches and social evangelization under the auspices of the second and third generations of Korean bishops. The Church has thus been active in constructing new church buildings, along with its continued efforts in opening the new additional churches since the mid-1980s. In this context the Board of Mission and Education has played a role in offering education and training programs.

On occasion of its centennial anniversary on September 29, 1990, the Anglican Church of Korea reaffirmed its intent under the theme. &quot;Jesus Christ, Life of the Nation&quot;, to continue proclaiming the message of life to the people and expediting the peaceful reunification of Korea as desired.

The Provincial Constitution of the Anglican Church of Korea was declared on September 29, 1992, and the first Korean primate was inaugurated on April 16, 1993. Thus, the Church has become an independent national church.

==Theology==
The Anglican Church of Korea has clergy and members reflecting diverse views. The church ordains women as priests and has been doing so since 2001. Regarding issues of human sexuality, some clergy, congregations, and members of the denomination have been affirming and supportive of LGBT rights including by participating in Pride events. The Anglican Church in Korea is considered to be more open toward homosexuality and is discussing the matter. One cleric, representing the Anglican Church in a Korean Christian dialogue, presented a &quot;let&#x27;s see&quot; approach regarding homosexuality.

==Structure and leadership==
The church was previously under the authority of the archbishop of Canterbury. To mark independence in 1993, the archbishop of Canterbury handed his authority as metropolitan and primate to the first archbishop of Korea. The church now forms a single metropolitical province, consisting of three dioceses: Seoul, Busan, and Daejeon. The primacy rotates between the three; thus the current bishop of Seoul is also the Archbishop of Korea and Primate of the Church.

<text>Francesco Felice Banali (November 14, 1951 – August 20, 2020) was an American rock drummer, most widely known for his work with heavy metal band Quiet Riot. His signature tone and iconic drum intros first became famous on their album &quot;Metal Health&quot;, which was the first metal album to hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and helped usher in the 80&#x27;s metal band era. He had been the band&#x27;s manager since 1993. He had also played the drums in the heavy metal band W.A.S.P., as well as with Billy Idol. Banali was briefly a touring drummer for Faster Pussycat and Steppenwolf. In the last few months of his life, he was also an inclined painter.

==Life and career==
Banali was born on November 14, 1951, in Queens, New York City, New York, to Italian immigrants, Jack and Martha Banali. In 1975, he moved to Los Angeles, where he spent four years playing drums with various bands, including Steppenwolf with Nick St. Nicholas and Goldy McJohn. He was a very prolific session player and played on many hits for other artists including Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;Mony Mony&quot; and &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and over 100 recordings. He also played drums on the acclaimed &quot;Hughes/Thrall&quot; album with Glenn Hughes and Pat Thrall. In 1979, Banali, along with bassist Dana Strum, was in secret rehearsals with then Quiet Riot guitarist Randy Rhoads and Ozzy Osbourne as the latter was looking for a guitar player to launch a new band. In 1980, he joined forces with Kevin DuBrow and formed DuBrow with a revolving door of musicians, before settling with former Snow guitarist Carlos Cavazo and bassist Chuck Wright. After Rudy Sarzo replaced Wright, DuBrow changed the name of the group to Quiet Riot (which was the same name of the band that DuBrow, Sarzo and Randy Rhoads had used prior to Sarzo and Rhoads leaving to join Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band). After signing with Pasha Records in September 1982, Banali and Quiet Riot found success with &quot;Metal Health&quot;, which was released six months after signing their deal with Pasha Records. In November 1983, only eight months after its release, &quot;Metal Health&quot; reached the #1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts (replacing the Police&#x27;s &quot;Synchronicity&quot;), making it the first heavy metal album to go #1 on the charts. &quot;Metal Health&quot; eventually sold over 10 million copies worldwide and help usher in the decade of heavy metal hair rock.

By the time &quot;Condition Critical&quot; was released in July 1984, tensions began to slowly break Quiet Riot apart, but Banali held on, through lineup changes and a diminishing fan base (mostly caused by Kevin DuBrow&#x27;s erratic behavior). By 1989, Quiet Riot disbanded after touring in support of their self-titled album, which was released in October 1988. Around the time of recording their self-titled album, he also played drums for W.A.S.P.&#x27;s &quot;The Headless Children&quot; album. After Quiet Riot disbanded, he rejoined W.A.S.P. to tour in support of the album. In 1990, Banali was called in by Faster Pussycat to replace the fired Mark Michals, during their tour in support of their 1989 album &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot;. After his mother&#x27;s death in November 1990, Banali regrouped and formed a band called Heavy Bones with guitarist Gary Hoey. They released only one album in 1992, before disbanding. In 1993, Banali rejoined Quiet Riot after Bobby Rondinelli left the band to join Black Sabbath. In 1994, he also took over as the band&#x27;s manager, overseeing the band&#x27;s business decisions. After three albums and more lineup changes (including the reunion of the classic Metal Health lineup from 1997 onwards), Quiet Riot disbanded in 2003. Banali and DuBrow reformed Quiet Riot in October 2004 with bassist Chuck Wright and new guitarist Alex Grossi. They released one album with the lineup, &quot;Rehab&quot; in 2006, before the untimely death of DuBrow in November 2007. Banali announced the dissolving of Quiet Riot on January 14, 2008.

It would not be until September 2010 that Banali (with the blessing of Kevin DuBrow&#x27;s family) reformed Quiet Riot with Wright and Grossi. They originally hired Mark Huff, but he was let go in January 2012. While Keith St. John came in to fulfill the tour dates, they hired Scott Vokoun in March 2012. In November 2013, Vokoun left and was replaced by Jizzy Pearl. And in June 2014, Quiet Riot released &quot;10&quot;, their first album in eight years. In mid-2010, Banali had an online fundraiser via Kickstarter with his then fiancé Regina Russell Banali for the seed money for production of a documentary about the band, titled &quot;Quiet Riot - Well Now You&#x27;re Here There&#x27;s No Way Back&quot;, a film she both produced and directed. The final amount raised was nearly $24,000, The film premiered at the Newport Beach Film Festival on April 29, 2014.

On January 18, 2017, Frankie was inducted into the Metal Hall of Fame for his contribution to Heavy Metal drums.

Banali was interviewed for the 2020 book, &quot;BONZO: 30 Rock Drummers Remember the Legendary John Bonham&quot;, by author Greg Prato.

==Influences==
Frankie Banali&#x27;s main influences include John Bonham (rock drumming) and Buddy Rich, (traditional Jazz drumming). For standard drumming his influences were Simon Phillips, Dennis Chambers, and Vinnie Colaiuta, just to name a few

==Personal life and death==
Frankie&#x27;s father, Jack, died from pancreatic cancer in 1974. Frankie&#x27;s mother, Martha, died after an eight-year battle with breast cancer, on November 14, 1990, Frankie&#x27;s 39th birthday.

Frankie married his first wife, Karen (born 1969), in 1994. On February 17, 1997, his daughter, Ashley, was born. On April 14, 2009, Karen died from heart failure at the age of 40.
On November 11, 2015, Frankie married his second wife Regina Russell Banali, who produced and directed a documentary about Quiet Riot called &quot;Quiet Riot: Well Now You&#x27;re Here, There&#x27;s No Way Back&quot;.

In October 2019, Banali revealed that he was diagnosed with stage-IV pancreatic cancer on April 17. He died from the disease on August 20, 2020, at age 68. This left Banali as the second member of the classic &quot;Metal Health&quot;-era Quiet Riot lineup to have died, following Kevin DuBrow in November 2007. It was announced three weeks after his death that Quiet Riot would continue without Banali, who was replaced by Johnny Kelly.

On September 4, 2020, as a result of a fan-led petition, MTV Classic on their &quot;Metal Mayem&quot; show, which aired every Friday evening from 9 PM to 1 AM EST, aired a rock block of Quiet Riot videos to honor Frankie. The block started at the beginning of the show and included these 6 videos: &quot;Party all Night&quot;, &quot;Twilight Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Wild and the Young&quot;, &quot;Bang Your Head (Metal Health)&quot;, &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;, and &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot;. At the beginning of each video text in blue and white scrolled in from the right and lasted a few seconds saying &quot;In Memory of Frankie Banali, 1951-2020&quot;. The block lasted 37 minutes which included commercials between the third and fourth videos.

<text>&quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; is a science fiction novella by American writer James Tiptree, Jr. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1974.

==Plot summary==
The story takes place in a dystopian future where the world is controlled by a capitalist regime. Despite advertising being illegal (&quot;ad&quot; is, in fact, a dirty word), corporations are still able to persuade and control consumers by the celebrities they create for product placement. The protagonist, seventeen-year-old Philadelphia Burke, or P. Burke, is enlisted to become one of these celebrities after a suicide attempt fueled by society ostracizing her due to her Pituitary Dystrophy, better known as Cushing&#x27;s Disease. While recovering in the hospital, she is chosen by a scout to become a &quot;Remote Operator&quot; for the beautiful corporate creation, known as Delphi, who was grown without a functioning brain from a modified embryo in an artificial womb. Though Delphi appears to be a normal fifteen-year-old-girl, she is controlled through a satellite linked to P. Burke&#x27;s brain, which is still physically located in her original body.

=== The Remote and the Operator ===
The purpose of a remote and a remote operator, such as Delphi and P. Burke, is to remove the fear a company might have that a normal celebrity could act of their own accord. P. Burke controls Delphi, making her say and do whatever the company tells her to. That being said, after months of training, Delphi is strategically placed in a minor documentary film, and she becomes a media sensation overnight. Her job is to act as a celebrity traveling all over the world, all the while subtly buying and promoting products to influence the public in favor of a company.

=== A Harsh Reality ===
P. Burke not only falls in love with the life style, but Delphi as well. Acting as a perfect teenage girl, P. Burke has everything she has ever wanted. She has fame, respect, wealth, power, and eventually love. Paul Isham, the rich and rebellious son of a network executive, notices Delphi on the set of her Soap Opera and falls in love with her. P. Burke - and, by default, Delphi - reciprocates his feelings, but cannot let him know the truth. He eventually discovers and misunderstands the situation, believing Delphi is a normal girl who is enslaved by implants. He breaks into the lab where P. Burke is and is shocked to see Delphi being controlled by an unattractive, bedridden woman connected to countless machines. Out of rage and confusion, he rips the wires out of P. Burke, killing her. Delphi remains biologically &quot;alive&quot; and is put under the control of another operator.

== Analysis ==
The underlying discussions that take place in relation to &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; tend to focus on the female body and gender embodiment. In her article titled &quot;&quot;Whatever It Is that She&#x27;s Since Become&quot;: Writing Bodies of Text and Bodies of Women in James Tiptree Jr.&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; and William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Winter Market&quot;&quot;, Heather J. Hicks puts focus on Tiptree&#x27;s take on female embodiment in the form of P. Burke. Tiptree uses phrases like &quot;pumped-out hulk&quot;, &quot;girl brute&quot; and &quot;carcass&quot; to devalue P. Burke, which further increases her feeling of uselessness in the story. This negative version of female embodiment is shown in contrast to the positive embodiment seen through Delphi, who is described as &quot;flawless&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;. The juxtaposition of these two bodies allows for a discussion on the way different types of bodies function within the context of society presented throughout the story.

=== Different types of bodies ===
Two different types of bodies are presented throughout the story. Heather J. Hicks explains that Delphi is the body with value, while P. Burke is seen as the opposite. This obsession with perfection is seen through the use of celebrities, including Delphi, as advertisements. Her beauty gives her influence over the population, which in turn gives her opportunities that P. Burke will never have. Only through the proxy of Delphi can P. Burke be valued in society. Hicks explores this idea further, saying &quot;P. Burke welcomes the chance to shed the ignominious flesh and bone that have caused her so much suffering&quot; in order to become more valued. This means that P. Burke is willing to get rid of her own physical body in order to move up in society because she understands that it will never happen any other way. Social status within this society is so dependent on perfection and beauty that those who do not fall into that category want to move into better bodies. Hicks says this is precisely what gender disembodiment means within the context of &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot;.

=== Gender of the author ===
There is a relationship between the gender of the author and the message of the story. Hicks explains that Tiptree uses P. Burke as a metaphor for herself. The author, whose real name is Alice Bradley Sheldon, uses the male pen name of James Tiptree Jr. in order to be successful in the world of science fiction. Hicks says Sheldon &quot;becomes P. Burke, which powers the public persona that consumers desire&quot;. Not only does Sheldon use a male pen name, but her writing style is viewed as masculine as well. This further contributes to the gender embodiment that Tiptree tries to undertake. Like those in the story, consumers in the science fiction world want a body image that represents what they deem worthy. In the story, people want an idealized female body, and in the real world science fiction consumers want a male body producing their stories. Hicks says the way in which P. Burke is ousted by Paul &quot;suggests a conviction that her own body of work would not endure the revelation of her female body.&quot; In this method of analyzing the situation, Tiptree is suggesting that by writing this story she cannot be successful as a science fiction writer in her own body. Melissa Stevenson sums up this point in her article &quot;Trying to Plug In: Posthuman Cyborgs and the Search for Connection&quot; by saying that &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; &quot;is a tale of transformations and masks, the story of a girl who is not who she seems to be, written by an author who is not exactly who &quot;he&quot; seemed to be&quot;.

=== A male author for a male audience ===
One notable characteristic of &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; is how the author used a male narrator to tell the story to a predominantly male audience in order to play with the reader&#x27;s expectations of how the story will pan out. The story is being told by way of a male narrator most likely to a 1970&#x27;s male science fiction consumer. The story continuously being told through a male point of view comes to highlight issues that male readers might have when reading this short story. According to Stevenson, Tiptree utilizes this way of telling the story in order to influence male readers expectations of P. Burke and of the ways the story will turn out upside down. The narrator rebukes the reader on several occasions for having these false expectations. Stevenson gives an example of this with the actual attempted suicide of P. Burke on the park bench. The narrator chastises the reader because he is not interested in P. Burke but rather the surrounding city. The expectation here is that the life of the ugly P. Burke is relatively unimportant compared to the surroundings to the targeted male reader. Stevenson points out that after this, the reader is rebuked three different times for not focusing on P. Burke but each time this happens, the narration is moved to descriptions of the futuristic soundings, presumably in accord with what the male reader truly desires to read about. This goes back to what Heather J. Hicks states about the importance and success of the ideal feminine body compared to the non-ideal feminine body. P. Burke’s body is considered unimportant and the way the story is written and paced suggests just that.

=== The performance of gender ===
Another theme of &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; is the performance of gender. According to Veronica Hollinger, this story is about P. Burke’s pursuit of the ideal feminine body. P. Burke desperately wants to achieve this ideal body, but she cannot due to her physical appearance. According to Hollinger, P. Burke is performing the gender ideal through a distance by controlling Delphi. Hollinger states that P. Burke’s performance here gives her an opportunity that she would not otherwise have given her real body to “mimic acceptable femininity&quot;. She also says that P. Burke “is the divinely feminine Delphi as long as she performs Delphi. P. Burke is the actor and Delphi is her role”. This performance was P. Burke’s way to a fairy-tale ending. Delphi can only be feminine if she were to be performed in a feminine way. Hollinger’s entire analysis can be seen in parallel with the analysis of Heather J. Hicks when she discusses how P. Burke uses Delphi to push herself up in the ranks of society. In order to have more opportunities in the society presented, P. Burke must perform femininity through Delphi.

==Literary criticism==
The depiction of the body in &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; has been discussed by several feminist literary scholars. Amongst them are Scott Bukatman, Melissa Colleen Stevenson, Veronica Hollinger and Heather J. Hicks. Major themes in &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot;, as seen in the aforementioned authors articles referenced in this section, include disembodiment and re-embodiment, performance of femininity, oppression of the female body by cultural power structures and the female body in a technological society.

=== Constructed ideal of femininity ===
Veronica Hollinger, co-editor of the scholarly journal &quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot; of DePauw University, states in her article, &quot;(Re)reading Queerly: Science Fiction, Feminism, and the Defamiliarization of Gender&quot;, that women are forced to conform to a constructed ideal of femininity in order to avoid being seen as a failure or, to some extent, incomplete. To Hollinger, &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; is about the ways women experience pressure from society to fulfill the set standards of femininity as seen in P. Burke&#x27;s desperate desire to fully leaving her real body and re-embody permanently as Delphi. In a society where the only way to achieve happiness is by conforming completely to a constructed ideal, P. Burke has little choice but to live through the perfect girl body that is Delphi. Heather J. Hicks reinforces Hollinger&#x27;s views in her article &#x27;Whatever It Is That She’s Since Become&#x27;: Writing Bodies of Text and Bodies of Women in James Tiptree, Jr.’s “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” and William Gibson’s “The Winter Market”&quot; by stating that P. Burke denies her unappealing, real body. Hollinger sees P. Burke as a representation of the body that is utterly insignificant in the eyes of society. She discusses &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; in terms of how gender can act as a form of imprisonment when society expects an unrealistic display of femininity). P. Burke&#x27;s existence becomes meaningful only when her mind controls the beautiful but &quot;empty&quot; body called Delphi, thus the female body in meeting with technology creates a separation between the body and the mind where P. Burke&#x27;s only way of fulfilling the feminine beauty ideal is at the hands of technology. The futuristic world in which Tiptree Jr. stages her story has taught P. Burke to idolize the ideal that &quot;the Gods&quot; embody and so P. Burke willingly commits the act of &quot;performing femininity.&quot;

=== Description of P. Burke ===
Another way disembodiment and oppression of the female body is seen in &quot;The Girl Who was Plugged In&quot; is by the words used to describe the main character, i.e. the description of P. Burke. Early in the story Tiptree says, “That’s good, because now you can see she’s the ugly of the world. A tall monument to pituitary dystrophy. No surgeon would touch her.” In the opinion of Scott Bukatman, of Stanford University, Tiptree forms the body into something unclean and decaying through phrases such as &quot;dead daddy&quot;, &quot;rotten girl&quot; and &quot;zombie&quot;. Hicks suggests the use of crude words for the main character only gets worse as the story progresses to emphasize an unappealing display of female disembodiment. According to Bukatman, the body in &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; is a dominating and central figure, but it also serves to represent a definite limitation. This relates to Hollingers statement of P. Burke&#x27;s re-embodiment as Delphi becoming an actor/role relationship where P. Burke imagines herself as an actor that must fulfill a role, i.e. Delphi. This is a clear parallel to our own society&#x27;s failure to recognize the individual women as separate from the constructed cultural ideal of femininity. Stevenson&#x27;s view is that, to the deformed and shunned P. Burke, her life as Delphi is the only one that is actually real, because her original body left her excluded from the &quot;human&quot; category in the eyes of society, making her unable to form emotional connections or experience love until her re-embodiment as Delphi. Consequently, P. Burke feels more human as Delphi than as herself because society finally accepts and recognizes her existence. In other words, P. Burke is dependent on technology to be able to participate in society.

=== Relationships between women and technology ===
While Hollinger reads &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; through the ideological lens of gender as a performance, Hicks believes Tiptree connects female disembodiment with women&#x27;s relationship to technology. Delphi, who was made for the sole purpose of advertising, is the living example of the perfect woman, and through her work for GTX she participates in reinforcing the cultural ideal of the femininity she&#x27;s created after. In Hicks opinion, &quot;Delphi&#x27;s body is used in a capitalistic aim for the purpose of advertising to such an extent that her body becomes synonym with the products she advertises&quot;. However, Stevenson points out that, while Delphi is beautiful, she does not have an identity without the connection to P. Burke, which means they are both dependent on each other in order to function in society. Bukatman also argues that the act of merging with a machine, like P. Burke merges with Delphi, is, in feminist science fiction, an act of defeat, as opposed to the romanticized approach of cyberpunk where it is seen as necessary and a source of power. Bukatman points out that technological advances in science fiction are synonym with the furthering of a patriarchal power structure, as seen in the control of the female body in &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot;. Bukatman states; &quot;In this sense, Tiptree&#x27;s title refers to the state of being plugged in to male definitions of the feminine image and being; plugged in to the power structures of male technology.&quot;. He also points out the negative impact of altering your identity in Tiptree&#x27;s story, and states that it serves as a symbol of oppression rather than liberation from society&#x27;s conventions.

=== P. Burke and Delphi vs. Sheldon and Tiptree ===
Stevenson and Hicks both discuss the interesting and noteworthy parallel between P. Burke and Delphi and Alice Sheldon and her pseudonym, James Tiptree Jr. Stevenson points out that by writing under a male pseudonym, Sheldon was able to obtain a more &quot;attractive&quot; exterior with which she could connect to the male dominant science fiction writing community. Hicks believes that Sheldon herself may have experienced a form or disembodiment where she could only fulfill the ideals of the science fiction community by assuming a male persona. By the numerous ways Tiptree has touched on essential feminist topics in a single short story, it becomes clear why she was one of the most prominent feminist science fiction writers of her time.

<doc id="652234" wikidata="Q5321082" url="?curid=652234" title="Whitefield, Bengaluru">
<text>Whitefield is a suburb of Bangalore in the state of Karnataka, India. Established in 1882 as a settlement for the Eurasians and Anglo Indians of Bangalore, Whitefield remained a quaint little settlement at the eastern periphery of Bangalore city till the late 1990s when the local IT boom turned it into a major suburb. It is now a major part of Greater Bangalore. Whitefield is Bengaluru&#x27;s first tech corridor to be connected by Namma Metro.

The locality is named after David Emmanuel Starkenburgh White, founder of the European and Anglo Indian Association which received 4,000 acres of land from Mysore Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar in the 19th century.

==History==
In 1882, King Chamaraja Wodeyar X, the Maharaja of the Mysore State, granted of land to the Eurasian and Anglo-Indian Association for the establishment of agricultural settlements at Whitefield, which lay within his territory. The association was then about 170 strong with a committee of 30 members. They were part of the formation of the only settlement in India that Europeans and Eurasians could call their own. Mr. White, the then president of the E&amp;AI Association., took a lively interest in it and helped in its advancement which at the beginning was an uphill task.

In the first decade of the 1900s, there were about 45 houses: 18 were on the village site and the remainder were on farms throughout the settlement and contained about of land fit for cultivation. The number of residents in 1907 was 130. Lord Connemara, the then governor of Madras (1890) and General Sir Harry Prendergast, a British resident in Mysore, visited the settlement and lent support to the development of Whitefield. Subsequently, there were regular visits to Whitefield by the Bangalore District officials and high dignitaries from the Madras Presidency.

The settlement was south of the Bangalore-Madras (now Chennai) line and a station was built. It led to the influx of residents and their families who worked at Kolar Gold Fields, about (by train) to the east. It became convenient for those working at KGF to catch a train (running 3 to 4 times a day) and return to their families. There were frequent trains running to Bangalore to the west (by train). Reaching the settlement from the railway station was possible only by writing a letter to Mrs. Hamilton (wife of a James Hamilton, the keeper of the Waverly Inn) who would arrange for a bullock cart trip for 8 annas.
Until the late 1990s, Whitefield was a small village. It has since become a major hub for the Indian technology industry. The Export Promotion Industrial Park (EPIP) at Whitefield is one of the country&#x27;s first information technology parks—International Tech Park, Bangalore (ITPB) which houses offices of many IT and ITES companies.

Whitefield is now officially part of Bangalore city which is part of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike.

==Infrastructure==
Whitefield has started seeing a boom in residential construction since the latter half of 1990s and especially during 2002 and onwards.

There are two major four-lane roads connecting Bangalore city with Whitefield – Whitefield road via Mahadevapura and Varthur road (HAL Old Airport Road) via Marathahalli. Both roads intersect with Karnataka State highway 35 (SH 35) which runs north–south (Siddlaghatta in the north to Anekal in the south).

The Whitefield railway station is about 3 km north of the Whitefield Bus stop. It lies on the Bangalore-Chennai route and is double and electrified, the Krishnarajapura-Whitefield railway station section is slated to be converted to a quadruple line. The station is slated to become a junction with a new Whitefield-Kolar (53 km; 33 miles) line being laid. Neighbouring the Whitefield railway station is &quot;Brindavan&quot;, the ashram and winter residence of the Hindu spiritual leader Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.

The Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) has a large inland container depot just off Whitefield road near ITPB.

Shopping malls like Nexus Whitefield (earlier called The Forum Neighborhood Mall), Phoenix Market City, VR Bengaluru, Ascendas Park Square Mall and Nexus Shantiniketan Mall are in the Whitefield area. It also houses the renowned super speciality hospital, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences, Whitefield, inaugurated by Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba on 19 January 2001, which offers all the medical services for free. Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre is the other major super-speciality hospital in Whitefield.

Whitefield has extensive city bus connectivity with a wide range of services offered by BMTC. A Traffic and Transit Management Centre (TTMC) in EPIP is functional with schedules connecting it with most areas of the city.

The much anticipated Namma Metro project started catering to Whitefield under Phase 2 from 26 March 2023. The Purple line has been extended to cover stations from Krishnarajapura to Whitefield (Kadugodi) covering 13 stations in between. This 13.71 km long route was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25 March 2023.

Whitefield suffers from water shortages especially during summer months as the whole region relies almost entirely on groundwater. With the increase in housing and office space, the demand has been multiplying over the years, and groundwater depletion has been worsening alarmingly. BWSSB is supplying the region with water under the Cauvery Water Supply Scheme Stage IV, Phase II. BWSSB has been granted Rs. 1000 crore for water projects in 2012 including supplying water to areas of Greater Bangalore which includes Whitefield.

==Geographic location==

There are two main roads serving this area – Whitefield Road from Krishnarajapura and Whitefield Main Road from Varthur. From HAL Old Airport Road and Kudhanahalli Gate is direct link between Central City and Whitefield .On 2 November 2020, Whitefield recorded its poorest air quality since the lockdown due to COVID-19. On 24 January 2021, residents petitioned the authorities to save the neighbouring Pattandur Agrahara Lake. They demanded removal of encroachments and rejuvenation of the water body by the city corporation. Most of the People live in Varthur, Thubhannahalli, AECS Layout, Kudhanahalli Gate area, BEML layout because it is located close to Major Tech company

== Food and leisure ==
There are multiple malls and food hotspots in and around the Whitefield area, some of them include -

* ITPL Mall (Park Square Mall)
* Nexus Shantiniketan Mall
* Phoenix Marketcity
* VR Bengaluru
* Inorbit Mall, Bangalore
* Nexus Whitefield

These malls host multiple restaurants that cater to a variety of cuisines – Regional Indian cuisines, Japanese, fast food, etc.

Additional prominent standalone restaurants in the area apart from the ones hosted in malls include -

* Stoners (burger and ice cream franchise)
* Windmills Craftworks (restaurant and micro-brewery)
* Pasta Street (Italian cuisine)
* A2B – Adyar Ananda Bhavan (South Indian restaurant franchise)

<doc id="652247" wikidata="Q7935099" url="?curid=652247" title="Virtual field trip">
<text>A virtual field trip is a guided exploration through the World Wide Web that organizes a collection of pre-screened, thematically based web pages into a structured online learning experience. (Foley, 2003). Since 2007, another dynamic and interactive form of a virtual field trip has been – and is – freely available. The first was the Pilbara VFT (pilbara.mq.edu.au) with a much more extensive and up-to-date suite of astrobiology-related VFTs at vft.asu.edu.

The non-interactive forms of VFT are an inter-related collection of images, supporting text and/or other media, delivered electronically via the World Wide Web, in a format that can be professionally presented to relate the essence of a visit to a time or place. The virtual experience becomes a unique part of the participants&#x27; life experience. (Nix, 1999)

Virtual field trips (VFTs) started appearing around 1995 (LEARNZ), but greatly grew in popularity starting around 2000. The VFT was seen as a way to organize the educational potential of the internet in a coherent, appropriate fashion, particularly for primary and secondary education. A VFT can contain a selection of topic-specific web pages that are strung together into a grade-targeted, organized package. Often these types of VFT are provided by commercial distributors, such as Tramline. www.tramline.com

There are a number of different formats used for VFTs and if you do a search on the Web, you will find thousands of trips. Some trips simply consist of a list of links on one web page, while other trips use some type of navigator (or buttons) to move through the tour. Following current pedagogy; in its best implementation, a VFT is a real time guided field trip that is supported by interactive pages on the Web that have been selected by educators and arranged in a &quot;thread&quot; that teachers and students can follow in either lineal or broad searching. The live links with experts on-site in real-time is a key aspect in creating a &quot;real&quot; experience for students. For example, with LEARNZ virtual field trips students have asked questions of scientists in Antarctica, mining staff underground and even electrical engineers on the top of wind turbines.

Real-time virtual field trips involve the use of videoconferencing and audioconferencing technologies to permit students in one location to virtually visit and learn about people or places in another location. The use of Tandberg and other sound stations make this form of communication more accessible in education. H.323 videoconferencing is increasingly used for educational virtual field trips, since this connectivity option eliminates connection costs over the commodity Internet.

A virtual field trip is a simulated, real-time field trip. In the case of interactive video conferencing, &quot;students interact, in a live even, with a remotely located field trip host.&quot; Cole, Ray, Zanetis 2004

A virtual field trip for elementary learners is the opportunity to explore and see places, things, and people not normally seen on a typical classroom day. During a classroom virtual field trip, students can explore places across the high seas, states across our country, and many nearby or far away people, places, and things. This is an opportunity to see and experience the world without ever leaving the classroom.

The virtual field trip is cost-effective to schools. It eliminates the costs of renting transportation, additional insurance coverage and the cost of chaperons.

Elementary school teachers can explore many virtual field trip options through websites like Discovery Ed. There is a tremendous amount of information on the internet for planning virtual field trips geared towards this learning age. It is simple to find resources by searching the words &#x27;virtual field trip for elementary learners&#x27; on the web.

<doc id="652248" wikidata="Q1132713" url="?curid=652248" title="Bogdanov affair">
<text>The Bogdanov affair was an academic dispute over the legitimacy of the doctoral degrees obtained by French twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanov (usually spelled &quot;Bogdanoff&quot; in French language publications) and a series of theoretical physics papers written by them in order to obtain degrees. The papers were published in reputable scientific journals, and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a theory for describing what occurred before and at the Big Bang.

The controversy began in 2002, with an allegation that the twins, popular celebrities in France for hosting science-themed TV shows, had obtained PhDs with nonsensical work. Rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that their work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system that physics journals use to select papers for publication. While the Bogdanov brothers continued to defend the legitimacy of their work, the debate over whether it represented a contribution to physics spread from Usenet to many other internet forums, eventually receiving coverage in the mainstream media. A Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) internal report later concluded that their theses had no scientific value.

The incident prompted criticism of the Bogdanovs&#x27; approach to science popularization, led to a number of lawsuits, and provoked reflection among physicists as to how and why the peer review system can fail.

==Origin of the affair==
 The Bogdanov brothers were born in 1949 in the small village of Saint-Lary, in the Gascony region of southwest France. The brothers each studied applied mathematics in Paris, but then began careers in television, hosting several popular programs on science and science fiction. The first of these, &quot;Temps X&quot; (&quot;Time X&quot;), ran from 1979 to 1989.

In 1991 the Bogdanovs published a book, &quot;Dieu et la Science&quot; (&quot;God and Science&quot;), drawn from interviews with Catholic philosopher Jean Guitton, which became a French bestseller. This book provoked a dispute of its own when University of Virginia astronomy professor Trinh Xuan Thuan accused the Bogdanovs of plagiarizing his 1988 book &quot;The Secret Melody: And Man Created the Universe&quot;. After a legal battle in France, during which a judge initially ruled in Thuan&#x27;s favour, Thuan and the Bogdanovs settled out of court, and the Bogdanovs later denied all wrongdoing. Thuan suggests that the plagiarism suit pressed the brothers to obtain doctorates as fast as possible, since (according to Thuan) the back cover of the book claimed that the Bogdanovs held doctorates when they did not. In 1993, the brothers began work toward doctorates, first working under the mathematical physicist of the University of Burgundy. Flato died in 1998, and his colleague Daniel Sternheimer (of CNRS) took over the job of supervising the Bogdanovs. According to Sternheimer, the twins viewed themselves as &quot;the Einstein brothers&quot; and had a propensity to voice vague, &quot;impressionistic&quot; statements; he considered guiding their efforts &quot;like teaching My Fair Lady to speak with an Oxford accent.&quot; As he told &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, Sternheimer did not consider himself an expert in all the topics Grichka Bogdanov included in his thesis, but judged that those portions within his specialty were PhD-quality work.

Grichka Bogdanov was given a PhD by the University of Burgundy (Dijon) in 1999, though this doctorate is sometimes erroneously described as having been granted by the École Polytechnique. He originally applied for a degree in physics, but was instead given one in mathematics, and was first required to significantly rewrite his thesis, de-emphasizing the physics content. Around the same time, Igor Bogdanov failed the defense of his thesis. His advisors subsequently agreed to allow him to obtain a doctorate if he could publish three peer-reviewed journal articles. In 2002, after publishing the requisite articles, Igor was given a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Burgundy. Both of the brothers received the lowest passing grade of &quot;honorable&quot;, which is seldom given, as Daniel Sternheimer told &quot;The New York Times&quot; science reporter Dennis Overbye. In justifying the conferring of doctoral degrees to the Bogdanovs, Sternheimer told the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;These guys worked for 10 years without pay. They have the right to have their work recognized with a diploma, which is nothing much these days.&quot;

In 2001 and 2002 the brothers published five papers in peer-reviewed physics journals, including &quot;Annals of Physics&quot; and &quot;Classical and Quantum Gravity&quot;. The controversy over the Bogdanovs&#x27; work began on October 22, 2002, with an email sent by University of Tours physicist Max Niedermaier to University of Pittsburgh physicist Ezra T. Newman. Niedermaier suggested that the Bogdanovs&#x27; PhD theses and papers were &quot;spoof[s]&quot;, created by throwing together instances of theoretical-physics jargon, including terminology from string theory: &quot;The abstracts are delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords ... which apparently have been taken seriously.&quot; Copies of the email reached American mathematical physicist John Baez, and on 23 October he created a discussion thread about the Bogdanovs&#x27; work on the Usenet newsgroup &quot;sci.physics.research&quot;, titled &quot;Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax?&quot; Baez was comparing the Bogdanovs&#x27; publications to the 1996 Sokal affair, in which physicist Alan Sokal successfully submitted an intentionally nonsensical paper to a cultural studies journal in order to criticize that field&#x27;s lax standards for discussing science. The Bogdanovs quickly became a popular discussion topic, with most respondents agreeing that the papers were flawed. The story spread in public media, prompting Niedermaier to offer an apology to the Bogdanovs, admitting that he had not read the papers firsthand. The Bogdanovs&#x27; background in entertainment lent some plausibility to the idea that they were attempting a deliberate hoax, but Igor Bogdanov quickly denied the accusation.

The Bogdanov brothers themselves participated in the online discussions, sometimes using pseudonyms or represented by friends acting as proxies. They used these methods to defend their work and sometimes to insult their critics, among them the Nobel Prize recipient Georges Charpak.

In October 2002, the Bogdanovs released an email containing apparently supportive statements by Laurent Freidel, then a visiting professor at the Perimeter Institute. Soon after, Freidel denied writing any such remarks, telling the press that he had forwarded a message containing that text to a friend. The Bogdanovs then attributed the quoted passages to Freidel, who said, &quot;I&#x27;m very upset about that because I have received e-mail from people in the community asking me why I&#x27;ve defended the Bogdanov brothers. When your name is used without your consent, it&#x27;s a violation.&quot;

At the start of the controversy in the moderated group &quot;sci.physics.research&quot;, Igor Bogdanov denied that their published papers were a hoax, but when asked precise questions from physicists Steve Carlip and John Baez regarding mathematical details in the papers, failed to convince any other participants that these papers had any real scientific value. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter George Johnson described reading through the debate as &quot;like watching someone trying to nail Jell-O to a wall&quot;, for the Bogdanovs had &quot;developed their own private language, one that impinges on the vocabulary of science only at the edges.&quot;

==Media reports and comments from scientists==
The online discussion was quickly followed by media attention. &quot;The Register&quot; reported on the dispute on November 1, 2002, and stories in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and other publications appeared soon after. These news stories included commentary by physicists.

===Thesis readers===
One of the scientists who approved Igor Bogdanov&#x27;s thesis, Roman Jackiw of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spoke to &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Dennis Overbye. Overbye wrote that Jackiw was intrigued by the thesis, although it contained many points he did not understand. Jackiw defended the thesis:All these were ideas that could possibly make sense. It showed some originality and some familiarity with the jargon. That&#x27;s all I ask.

In contrast, Ignatios Antoniadis (of the École Polytechnique), who approved Grichka Bogdanov&#x27;s thesis, later reversed his judgment of it. Antoniadis told &quot;Le Monde&quot;,

I had given a favorable opinion for Grichka&#x27;s defense, based on a rapid and indulgent reading of the thesis text. Alas, I was completely mistaken. The scientific language was just an appearance behind which hid incompetence and ignorance of even basic physics.

===Pre- and post-publication official commentary on the journal articles===

In May 2001, the journal &quot;Classical and Quantum Gravity&quot; (CQG) reviewed an article authored by Igor and Grichka Bogdanov, titled &quot;Topological theory of the initial singularity of spacetime&quot;. One of the referees&#x27; reports stated that the article was &quot;Sound, original, and of interest. With revisions I expect the paper to be suitable for publication.&quot; The paper was accepted by the journal seven months later.

However, after the publication of the article and the publicity surrounding the controversy, mathematician Greg Kuperberg posted to Usenet a statement written by the journal&#x27;s senior publisher, Andrew Wray, and its co-editor, Hermann Nicolai. The statement read, in part,

Regrettably, despite the best efforts, the refereeing process cannot be 100% effective. Thus the paper ... made it through the review process even though, in retrospect, it does not meet the standards expected of articles in this journal... The paper was discussed extensively at the annual Editorial Board meeting ... and there was general agreement that it should not have been published. Since then several steps have been taken to further improve the peer review process in order to improve the quality assessment on articles submitted to the journal and reduce the likelihood that this could happen again.

The paper in question was, however, not officially withdrawn by the journal. Later, the editor-in-chief of the journal issued a slightly different statement on behalf of the Institute of Physics, which owns the journal, in which he insisted on the fact that their usual peer-review procedures had been followed, but no longer commented on the value of the paper. Moreover, &quot;Die Zeit&quot; quoted Nicolai as saying that had the paper reached his desk, he would have immediately rejected it.

In 2001, the &quot;Czechoslovak Journal of Physics&quot; accepted an article written by Igor Bogdanov, entitled &quot;Topological Origin of Inertia&quot;. The referee&#x27;s report concluded: &quot;In my opinion the results of the paper can be considered as original ones. I recommend the paper for publication but in a revised form.&quot; The following year, the &quot;Chinese Journal of Physics&quot; published Igor Bogdanov&#x27;s &quot;The KMS state of spacetime at the Planck scale&quot;. The report stated that &quot;the viewpoint presented in this paper can be interesting as a possible approach of the Planck scale physics.&quot; Some corrections were requested.

Not all review evaluations were positive. Eli Hawkins, acting as a referee on behalf of the &quot;Journal of Physics A&quot;, suggested rejecting one of the Bogdanovs&#x27; papers: &quot;It is difficult to describe what is wrong in Section 4, since almost nothing is right. [...] It would take up too much space to enumerate all the mistakes: indeed it is difficult to say where one error ends and the next begins. In conclusion, I would not recommend that this paper be published in this, or any, journal.&quot;

===Online criticism of the papers===

After the start of the Usenet discussion, most comments were critical of the Bogdanovs&#x27; work. For example, John C. Baez stated that the Bogdanov papers are &quot;a mishmash of superficially plausible sentences containing the right buzzwords in approximately the right order. There is no logic or cohesion in what they write.&quot; Jacques Distler voiced a similar opinion, proclaiming &quot;The [Bogdanovs&#x27;] papers consist of buzzwords from various fields of mathematical physics, string theory and quantum gravity, strung together into syntactically correct, but semantically meaningless prose.&quot;

Others compared the quality of the Bogdanov papers with that seen over a wider arena. &quot;The Bogdanoffs&#x27; work is significantly more incoherent than just about anything else being published&quot;, wrote Peter Woit. He continued, &quot;But the increasingly low standard of coherence in the whole field is what allowed them to think they were doing something sensible and to get it published.&quot; Woit later devoted a chapter of his book &quot;Not Even Wrong&quot; (2006) to the Bogdanov affair.

Participants in the discussions were particularly unconvinced by a statement in the &quot;Topological origin of inertia&quot; paper that &quot;whatever the orientation, the plane of oscillation of Foucault&#x27;s pendulum is necessarily aligned with the initial singularity marking the origin of physical space.&quot; In addition, the paper claimed, the Foucault pendulum experiment &quot;cannot be explained satisfactorily in either classical or relativistic mechanics&quot;. The physicists commenting on Usenet found these claims and subsequent attempts at their explanation peculiar, since the trajectory of a Foucault pendulum—a standard museum piece—is accurately predicted by classical mechanics. The Bogdanovs explained that these claims would only be clear in the context of topological field theory. Baez and Russell Blackadar attempted to determine the meaning of the &quot;plane of oscillation&quot; statement; after the Bogdanovs issued some elaborations, Baez concluded that it was a complicated way of rephrasing the following:
Since the big bang happened everywhere, no matter which way a pendulum swings, the plane in which it swings can be said to &quot;intersect the big bang&quot;.
However, Baez pointed out, this statement does not in fact concern the Big Bang, and is entirely equivalent to the following:
No matter which way a pendulum swings, there is some point on the plane in which it swings.
Yet this rephrasing is itself equivalent to the following statement: Any plane contains a point. If &quot;this&quot; was the essence of the statement, Baez noted, it cannot be very useful in &quot;explaining the origin of inertia&quot;.

Urs Schreiber, then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hamburg, noted that the mention of the Foucault pendulum was at odds with the papers&#x27; general tone, since they generally relied upon more &quot;modern terminology&quot;. (According to George Johnson, the Foucault pendulum is &quot;an icon of French science that would belong in any good Gallic spoof.&quot;) Schreiber identified five central ideas in the Bogdanovs&#x27; work—&quot;&#x27;result&#x27; A&quot; through &quot;&#x27;result&#x27; E&quot;—which are expressed in the jargon of statistical mechanics, topological field theory and cosmology. One bit of jargon, the Hagedorn temperature, comes from string theory, but as Schreiber notes, the paper does not use this concept in any detail; moreover, since the paper is manifestly not a string theory treatise, &quot;considering the role the Hagedorn temperature plays in string cosmology, this is bordering on self-parody.&quot; Schreiber concludes that the fourth &quot;result&quot; (that the spacetime metric &quot;at the initial singularity&quot; must be Riemannian) contradicts the initial assumption of their argument (an FRW cosmology with &quot;pseudo&quot;-Riemannian metric). The fifth and last &quot;result&quot;, Schreiber notes, is an attempt to resolve this contradiction by &quot;invok[ing] quantum mechanics&quot;. The Bogdanovs themselves described Schreiber&#x27;s summary as &quot;very accurate&quot;; for more on this point, see below. Schreiber concluded,
Just to make sure: I do not think that any of the above is valid reasoning. I am writing this just to point out what I think are the central &#x27;ideas&#x27; the authors had when writing their articles and how this led them to their conclusions.

Eli Hawkins of Pennsylvania State University voiced a similar concern about &quot;The KMS state of spacetime at the Planck scale&quot;.

The main result of this paper is that this thermodynamic equilibrium should be a KMS state. This almost goes without saying; for a quantum system, the KMS condition is just the concrete definition of thermodynamic equilibrium. The hard part is identifying the quantum system to which the condition should be applied, which is not done in this paper.

Both Baez and, later, Peter Woit noted that content was largely repeated from one Bogdanov paper to another.
Damien Calaque of the Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, criticized Grichka Bogdanov&#x27;s unpublished preprint &quot;Construction of cocycle bicrossproducts by twisting&quot;. In Calaque&#x27;s estimation, the results presented in the preprint did not have sufficient novelty and interest to merit an independent journal article, and moreover the principal theorem was, in its current formulation, false: Grichka Bogdanov&#x27;s construction yields a bialgebra which is not necessarily a Hopf algebra, the latter being a type of mathematical object which must satisfy additional conditions.

Eventually, the controversy attracted mainstream media attention, opening new avenues for physicists&#x27; comments to be disseminated. quoted Alain Connes, recipient of the 1982 Fields Medal, as saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t need long to convince myself that they&#x27;re talking about things that they haven&#x27;t mastered.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the physicists David Gross, Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin considered the Bogdanov papers nonsensical. Nobel laureate Georges Charpak later stated on a French talk show that the Bogdanovs&#x27; presence in the scientific community was &quot;nonexistent&quot;.

The most positive comments about the papers themselves came from string theorist Luboš Motl:

...Some of the papers of the Bogdanoff brothers are really painful and clearly silly ... But the most famous paper about the solution of the initial singularity is a bit different; it is more sophisticated.

...it does not surprise me much that Roman Jackiw said that the paper satisfied everything he expects from an acceptable paper—the knowledge of the jargon and some degree of original ideas. (And be sure that Jackiw, Kounnas, and Majid were not the only ones with this kind of a conclusion.)

...Technically, their paper connects too many things. It would be too good if all these ideas and (correct) formulae were necessary for a justification of a working solution to the initial singularity problem. But if one accepts that the papers about these difficult questions don&#x27;t have to be just a well-defined science but maybe also a bit of inspiring art, the brothers have done a pretty good job, I think. And I want to know the answers to many questions that are opened in their paper.

Motl&#x27;s measured support for &quot;Topological field theory of the initial singularity of spacetime&quot;, however, stands in stark contrast to Robert Oeckl&#x27;s official MathSciNet review, which states that the paper is &quot;rife with nonsensical or meaningless statements and suffers from a serious lack of coherence,&quot; follows up with several examples to illustrate his point, and concludes that the paper &quot;falls short of scientific standards and appears to have no meaningful content.&quot; An official report from the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), which became public in 2010, concluded that the paper &quot;ne peut en aucune façon être qualifié de contribution scientifique&quot; (&quot;cannot in any way be considered a scientific contribution&quot;). The CNRS report summarized the Bogdanovs&#x27; theses thusly: &quot;Ces thèses n’ont pas de valeur scientifique. […] Rarement aura-t-on vu un travail creux habillé avec une telle sophistication&quot; (&quot;These theses have no scientific value. [...] Rarely have we seen a hollow work dressed with such sophistication&quot;&quot;&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Claims of pseudonymous activity===

One episode after the heyday of the affair involved the participation of an unidentified &quot;Professor Yang&quot;. Using an e-mail address at the domain &quot;th-phys.edu.hk&quot;, an individual publishing under this name wrote to a number of individuals and on the Internet to defend the Bogdanov papers. This individual wrote to physicists John Baez, Jacques Distler and Peter Woit; to &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Dennis Overbye; and on numerous physics blogs and forums, signing his name &quot;Professor L. Yang—Theoretical Physics Laboratory, International Institute of Mathematical Physics—HKU/Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong.&quot; It is the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology which is located in Clear Water Bay, not Hong Kong University (HKU), whose main campus is located in the Mid-Levels of Hong Kong Island.

The Bogdanovs have claimed that the &quot;domain name &#x27;th-phys.edu.hk&#x27; was owned by Hong Kong University.&quot; This was not confirmed officially by HKU and no Prof. Yang existed on the roster of the HKU physics department; nor did the university have an &quot;International Institute of Mathematical Physics&quot;.

Suspicions were consequently raised that Professor L. Yang was actually a pseudonym of the Bogdanovs. However, Igor Bogdanov has maintained that Professor Yang is a real mathematical physicist with expertise in KMS theory, a friend of his, and that he was posting anonymously from Igor&#x27;s apartment.

===&quot;Rayons X&quot; and &quot;Avant Le Big Bang&quot;===

In 2002, the Bogdanovs launched a new weekly TV show &quot;Rayons X&quot; (&quot;X Rays&quot;) on French public channel France 2. In August 2004, they presented a 90-minute special cosmology program in which they introduced their theory among other cosmological scenarios. The French mainstream media, in both the press and on the Internet, covered the renewed controversy to some extent; media outlets that reported upon it include &quot;Acrimed&quot; and &quot;Ciel et Espace.&quot;
In 2004, the Bogdanovs published a commercially successful popular science book, &quot;Avant Le Big Bang&quot; (&quot;Before the Big Bang&quot;), based on a simplified version of their theses, where they also presented their point of view about the affair. Both the book and the Bogdanovs&#x27; television shows have been criticized for elementary scientific and mathematical inaccuracies. Critics cite examples from &quot;Avant Le Big Bang&quot; including a statement that the &quot;golden number&quot; φ (&quot;phi&quot;) is transcendental, an assumption that the limit of a decreasing sequence is always zero, and that the expansion of the Universe implies that the planets of the Solar System have grown farther apart.

In October 2004, a journalist from &quot;Ciel et Espace&quot; interviewed Shahn Majid of Queen Mary, University of London about his report on Grichka Bogdanov&#x27;s thesis. Majid said that the French version of his report on Grichka&#x27;s thesis was &quot;an unauthorized translation partially invented by the Bogdanovs.&quot; In one sentence, the English word &quot;interesting&quot; was translated as the French &quot;important&quot;. A &quot;draft [mathematical] construction&quot; became &quot;la première construction [mathématique]&quot; (&quot;the first [mathematical] construction&quot;). Elsewhere, an added word demonstrated, according to Majid, that &quot;Bogdanov does not understand his own draft results.&quot; Majid also described more than ten other modifications of meaning, each one biased towards &quot;surestimation outrancière&quot;—&quot;outrageous over-estimation&quot;. Majid said that his original report described a &quot;very weak&quot; student who nevertheless demonstrated &quot;an impressive amount of determination to obtain a doctorate.&quot; Later, Majid claimed in a Usenet post that, in an addendum to &quot;Avant Le Big Bang,&quot; Grichka intentionally misquoted Majid&#x27;s opinion on the way this interview had been transcribed.
Additionally, in the same addendum, a critical analysis of their work made by Urs Schreiber, and affirmed by the Bogdanovs as &quot;very accurate&quot;, was included with the exception of the concluding remark &quot;Just to make sure: I do not think that any of the above is valid reasoning&quot;, thus inverting the meaning from criticism into ostensible support. Moreover, a comment by physicist Peter Woit written as, &quot;It&#x27;s certainly possible that you have some new worthwhile results on quantum groups&quot;, was translated as &quot;Il est tout à fait certain que vous avez obtenu des résultats nouveaux et utiles dans les groupes quantiques&quot; (&quot;It is completely certain that you have obtained new and useful results on quantum groups&quot;) and published by the Bogdanovs in the addendum of their book.

===Disputes on French and English Wikipedias===

At the beginning of 2004, Igor Bogdanov began to post on French Usenet physics groups and Internet forums, continuing the pattern of behavior seen on &quot;sci.physics.research.&quot; A controversy began on the French Wikipedia when Igor Bogdanov and his supporters began to edit that encyclopedia&#x27;s article on the brothers, prompting the creation of a new article dedicated to the debate (&quot;Polémique autour des travaux des frères Bogdanov&quot;—&quot;Debate surrounding the work of the Bogdanov brothers&quot;). The dispute then spread to the English Wikipedia. In November 2005, this led the Arbitration Committee, a dispute resolution panel that acts as the project&#x27;s court of last resort, to ban anyone deemed to be a participant in the external dispute from editing the English Wikipedia&#x27;s article on the Bogdanov Affair. A number of English Wikipedia users, including Igor Bogdanov himself, were explicitly named in this ban. In 2006, Baez wrote on his website that for some time the Bogdanovs and &quot;a large crowd of sock puppets&quot; had been attempting to rewrite the English Wikipedia article on the controversy &quot;to make it less embarrassing to them&quot;. &quot;Nobody seems to be fooled&quot;, he added.

===Lawsuits===
In December 2004, the Bogdanovs sued &quot;Ciel et Espace&quot; for defamation over the publication of a critical article entitled &quot;The Mystification of the Bogdanovs&quot;. In September 2006, the case was dismissed after the Bogdanovs missed court deadlines; they were ordered to pay 2,500 euros to the magazine&#x27;s publisher to cover its legal costs. There was never a substantive ruling on whether the Bogdanovs had been defamed.
Alain Riazuelo, an astrophysicist at the Institut d&#x27;astrophysique de Paris, participated in many of the online discussions of the Bogdanovs&#x27; work. He posted an unpublished version of Grichka Bogdanov&#x27;s PhD thesis on his personal website, along with his critical analysis. Bogdanov subsequently described this version as &quot;dating from 1991 and too unfinished to be made public&quot;. Rather than suing Riazuelo for defamation, Bogdanov filed a criminal complaint of copyright (&quot;droit d&#x27;auteur&quot;) violation against him in May 2011. The police detained and interrogated Riazuelo. He came to trial and was convicted in March 2012. A fine of 2,000 euros the court imposed was suspended, and only one euro of damages was awarded. But in passing judgement the court stated that the scientist had &quot;lacked prudence&quot;, given &quot;the fame of the plaintiff&quot;.

The verdict outraged many scientists, who felt that the police and courts should have no say in a discussion of the scientific merits of a piece of work. In April 2012, a group of 170 scientists published an open letter titled &quot;L&#x27;affaire Bogdanoff: Liberté, Science et Justice, Des scientifiques revendiquent leur droit au blâme&quot; (&quot;The Bogdanov Affair: Liberty, Science and Justice, scientists claim their right of critique&quot;).

In 2014, the Bogdanovs sued the weekly magazine &quot;Marianne&quot; for defamation, on account of reporting the magazine had published in 2010 which had brought the CNRS report to light. The weekly was eventually ordered to pay 64,000 euros in damages, a quantity less than the Bogdanovs had originally demanded (in excess of 800,000 euros each). The Bogdanovs also sued the CNRS for 1.2 million euros in damages, claiming that the CNRS report had &quot;porté atteinte à leur honneur, à leur réputation et à leur crédit&quot; (&quot;undermined their honor, reputation and credit&quot;) and calling the report committee a &quot;Stasi scientifique&quot;, but a tribunal ruled against them in 2015 and ordered them to pay 2,000 euros.

===Megatrend University===
In 2005, the Bogdanovs became professors at Megatrend University in Belgrade where they were appointed Chairs of Cosmology and said to direct the Megatrend Laboratory of Cosmology. Mića Jovanović, the rector and owner of Megatrend University, wrote a preface for the Serbian edition of &quot;Avant le Big Bang.&quot; Jovanović later became embroiled in controversy and resigned his post when it was revealed that he had not obtained a PhD at the London School of Economics as he had claimed. This scandal, combined with the presence of the Bogdanovs, contributed to an atmosphere of controversy surrounding Megatrend.

===&quot;L&#x27;équation Bogdanov&quot;===
In 2008, published &quot;L&#x27;équation Bogdanov: le secret de l&#x27;origine de l&#x27;univers?&quot; (&quot;The Bogdanov Equation: The Secret of the Origin of the Universe?&quot;), officially written in English by Luboš Motl and translated into French. A review in &quot;Science et Vie&quot; found that the book was light on detail and never actually said what the &quot;Bogdanov equation&quot; is: &quot;Et arrivé à la conclusion, on n&#x27;est même plus très certain qu&#x27;elle existe réellement&quot; (&quot;Arriving at the conclusion, one is no longer even very certain that it really exists&quot;).

==Reflections upon the peer-review system==
During the heyday of this affair, some media coverage cast a negative light on theoretical physics, stating or at least strongly implying that it has become impossible to distinguish a valid paper from a hoax. Overbye&#x27;s article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; voiced this opinion, for example, as did Declan Butler&#x27;s piece in &quot;Nature.&quot; Posters on blogs and Usenet used the affair to criticize the present status of string theory; for the same reason, Peter Woit devoted a chapter of &quot;Not Even Wrong,&quot; a book emphatically critical of string theory, to the affair. On the other hand, George Johnson&#x27;s report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; concludes that physicists have generally decided the papers are &quot;probably just the result of fuzzy thinking, bad writing and journal referees more comfortable with correcting typos than challenging thoughts.&quot; String theorist Aaron Bergman riposted in a review of &quot;Not Even Wrong&quot; that Woit&#x27;s conclusion
is undermined by a number of important elisions in the telling of the story, the most important of which is that the writings of the Bogdanovs, to the extent that one can make sense of them, &quot;have almost nothing to do with string theory.&quot; ... I first learned of the relevant papers in a posting on the internet by Dr. John Baez. Having found a copy of one of the relevant papers available online, I posted that &quot;the referee clearly didn&#x27;t even glance at it.&quot; While the papers were full of rather abstruse prose about a wide variety of technical areas, it was easy to identify outright nonsense in the areas about which I had some expertise. ... A pair of non-string theorists were able to get nonsensical papers generally not about string theory published in journals not generally used by string theorists. This is surely an indictment of something, but its relevance to string theory is marginal at best.

Jacques Distler argued that the tone of the media coverage had more to do with journalistic practices than with physics.
The much-anticipated New York Times article on the Bogdanov scandal has appeared. Alas, it suffers from the usual journalistic conceit that a proper newspaper article must cover a &quot;controversy&quot;. There must be two sides to the controversy, and the reporter&#x27;s job is to elicit quotes from both parties and present them side-by-side. Almost inevitably, this &quot;balanced&quot; approach sheds no light on the matter, and leaves the reader shaking his head, &quot;There they go again...&quot;
Distler also suggested that the fact that the Bogdanovs had not uploaded their papers to the arXiv prior to publication, as was standard practice by that time, meant that the physics community must have paid vanishingly little attention to those papers before the hoax rumors broke.

The affair prompted many comments about the possible shortcomings of the referral system for published articles, and also on the criteria for acceptance of a PhD thesis. Frank Wilczek, who edited &quot;Annals of Physics&quot; (and who would later share the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics), told the press that the scandal motivated him to correct the journal&#x27;s slipping standards, partly by assigning more reviewing duties to the editorial board.

Prior to the controversy, the reports on the Bogdanov theses and most of the journal referees&#x27; reports spoke favorably of their work, describing it as original and containing interesting ideas. This has been the basis of concerns raised about the efficacy of the peer-review system that the scientific community and academia use to determine the merit of submitted manuscripts for publication; one concern is that over-worked and unpaid referees may not be able to thoroughly judge the value of a paper in the little time they can afford to spend on it. Regarding the Bogdanov publications, physicist Steve Carlip remarked:

Referees are volunteers, who as a whole put in a great deal of work for no credit, no money, and little or no recognition, for the good of the community. Sometimes a referee makes a mistake. Sometimes two referees make mistakes at the same time.
I&#x27;m a little surprised that anyone is surprised at this. Surely you&#x27;ve seen bad papers published in good journals before this! ... referees give opinions; the real peer review begins after a paper is published.

Similarly, Richard Monastersky, writing in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, observed, &quot;There is one way...for physicists to measure the importance of the Bogdanovs&#x27; work. If researchers find merit in the twins&#x27; ideas, those thoughts will echo in the references of scientific papers for years to come.&quot; Before the controversy over their work arose, the scientific community had shown practically no interest in the Bogdanovs&#x27; papers; indeed, according to Stony Brook physics professor Jacobus Verbaarschot, who served on Igor Bogdanov&#x27;s dissertation committee, without the hoax rumors &quot;probably no one would have ever known about their articles.&quot; , the Bogdanovs&#x27; most recent paper was &quot;Thermal Equilibrium and KMS Condition at the Planck Scale&quot;, which was submitted to the &quot;Chinese Annals of Mathematics&quot; in 2001 and appeared in 2003. That journal ceased publication in 2005. One retrospective commented,
:Up to 2007 the databanks mention a total of six citations for the Bogdanovs&#x27; publications. Four of them are citations among themselves and only two are by other physicists.

==Comparisons with the Sokal affair==

Several sources have referred to the Bogdanov affair as a &quot;reverse Sokal&quot; hoax, drawing a comparison with the Sokal affair, where the physicist Alan Sokal published a deliberately fraudulent and indeed nonsensical article in the humanities journal &quot;Social Text.&quot; Sokal&#x27;s original aim had been to test the effects of the intellectual trend he called, &quot;for want of a better term, postmodernism&quot;. Worried by what he considered a &quot;more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment&quot;, Sokal decided to perform an experiment which he later cheerfully admitted was both unorthodox and uncontrolled, provoking a maelstrom of reactions which, to his surprise, received coverage in and even the front page of &quot;The New York Times.&quot; The physicist John Baez compared the two events in his October 2002 post to the &quot;sci.physics.research&quot; newsgroup. Sociologist of science Harry Collins noted that all of the early reports of the incident made reference to the Sokal affair, and he speculated that without Sokal&#x27;s precedent bringing the idea of hoax publications to mind, the Bogdanov papers would have sunk into the general obscurity of non-influential scientific writing.

Igor and Grichka Bogdanov have and had vigorously insisted upon the validity of their work, while in contrast, Sokal was an outsider to the field in which he was publishing—a physicist, publishing in a humanities journal—and promptly issued a statement himself that his paper was a deliberate hoax. Replying on &quot;sci.physics.research&quot;, Sokal referred readers to his follow-up essay, in which he notes &quot;the mere fact of publication of my parody&quot; only proved that the editors of one particular journal—and a &quot;rather marginal&quot; one at that—had applied a lax intellectual standard. (According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sokal was &quot;almost disappointed&quot; that the Bogdanovs had not attempted a hoax after his own style. &quot;What&#x27;s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander&quot;, he said.) Baez, who made a comparison between the two affairs, later retracted, saying that the brothers &quot;have lost too much face for [withdrawing the work as a hoax] to be a plausible course of action&quot;.

In a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Cornell physics professor Paul Ginsparg wrote that the contrast between the cases was plainly evident: &quot;here, the authors were evidently aiming to be credentialed by the intellectual prestige of the discipline rather than trying to puncture any intellectual pretension.&quot; He added that the fact some journals and scientific institutions have low or variable standards is &quot;hardly a revelation&quot;. The observation was later confirmed by studies showing that high-prestige journals struggle to reach average reliability.

<doc id="652249" wikidata="Q297501" url="?curid=652249" title="Léonin">
<text>Léonin (also Leoninus, Leonius, Leo; ) was the first known significant composer of polyphonic organum. He was probably French, probably lived and worked in Paris at the Notre-Dame Cathedral and was the earliest member of the Notre Dame school of polyphony and the ars antiqua style who is known by name. The name Léonin is derived from &quot;Leoninus&quot;, which is the Latin diminutive of the name Leo; therefore it is likely that Léonin&#x27;s given French name was Léo.

==Overview==
All that is known about him comes from the writings of a later student at the cathedral known as Anonymous IV, an Englishman who left a treatise on theory and who mentions Léonin as the composer of the &quot;Magnus Liber,&quot; the &quot;great book&quot; of organum. Much of the &quot;Magnus Liber&quot; is devoted to clausulae—melismatic portions of Gregorian chant which were extracted into separate pieces where the original note values of the chant were greatly slowed down and a fast-moving upper part is superimposed. Léonin might have been the first composer to use the rhythmic modes, and may have invented a notation for them. According to W.G. Waite, writing in 1954: &quot;It was Léonin&#x27;s incomparable achievement to introduce a rational system of rhythm into polyphonic music for the first time, and, equally important, to create a method of notation expressive of this rhythm.&quot;

The &quot;Magnus Liber&quot; was intended for liturgical use. According to Anonymous IV, &quot;Magister Leoninus (Léonin) was the finest composer of organum; he wrote the great book (Magnus Liber) for the gradual and antiphoner for the sacred service.&quot; All of the &quot;Magnus Liber&quot; is for two voices, although little is known about actual performance practice: the two voices were not necessarily soloists.

According to Anonymous IV, Léonin&#x27;s work was improved and expanded by the later composer Pérotin. See also Medieval music.

The musicologist Craig M. Wright believes that Léonin may have been the same person as a contemporaneous Parisian poet, Leonius, after whom Leonine verse may have been named. This could make Léonin&#x27;s use of meter even more significant.

<text>Mr. Nanny is a 1993 American family comedy film starring professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The working title of the film was &quot;Rough Stuff&quot;, and David Johansen also recorded a song by that name for the film.

==Plot==
Sean Armstrong is a former wrestler living in Palm Beach, Florida and suffering from wrestler-days&#x27; nightmares. Burt Wilson, Sean&#x27;s friend and former manager, has a bum leg from saving Sean&#x27;s life and financial difficulties with his personal security business. With much whining and acting, Burt manages to persuade Sean to take a bodyguard job for Alex Mason Sr., the head of the prestigious tech firm, Mason Systems, which is developing a new anti-missile system, the Peacefinder Project. The vital information for this project is stored on a microchip. But it is neither the inventor nor the chip Sean has to guard – he is to look after the two Mason kids: Alex Jr. and Kate.

Alex and Kate are two highly mischievous kids who vie for their often-too-absent father&#x27;s attention by wreaking havoc in the household via elaborate and rather vicious pranks and booby-traps, with their specialty targets being the nannies he has assigned to take care of them (Alex Sr. is a widower). However, their father proves to be either too distracted or too lenient, which causes the children to continue their schemes. Thinking that he is a new, albeit unusual replacement, they find a new target in Sean. But after one prank too many, which involves a swimming pool full of red dye (&quot;the Pit of Blood&quot;), Sean finally exerts his authority and not only gets to quiet Alex and Kate down, he also manages to open the eyes of their father to his family problems, as well as bonding with the kids and managing to help them sort out problems of their own.

Mason&#x27;s chip is coveted by Tommy Thanatos, an unscrupulous and vain criminal who will not stop at anything to get it. As it turns out, Sean and Burt had been once at the receiving end of one of his schemes: he had ordered them to throw a match, and when they had not complied, he attempted to shoot them. However, Burt threw himself in front of Sean, taking the bullet in his right leg; Sean had chased Thanatos to the roof of the stadium, and after a furious fight, Thanatos ended up plunging head-first into an empty pool. This accident fractured the top of his skull, forcing the attachment of a steel skullplate and removing the bulk of his proud afro mane.

Thanatos kidnaps Alex Sr. with the help of Frank Olsen, the corrupt security chief of Mason Systems (who is disposed of en route to the hideout), and demands of him to hand over the chip. When Alex Sr. (who stowed the chip in Kate&#x27;s doll) refuses, Thanatos has Alex and Kate kidnapped in order to force him to comply. Despite a valiant effort, Sean is overpowered and Burt is taken as well, giving Thanatos an unexpected revenge bonus. But Sean manages to track down Thanatos, and with the help of his friends is able to beat the villains. As Thanatos prepares to charge Sean, Alex Sr. and the children activate an improvised electromagnet to launch him into the night sky, leaving only his skullplate.

The movie ends with Sean preparing to take a leave of absence from the Masons. But Alex and Kate intend to have him back much sooner – and therefore Sean falls victim to yet another prank.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a box office bomb, grossing just $4.3 million against its $10 million budget.

===Critical response===
The film was poorly received by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 6% based on reviews from 16 critics. On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 18 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; says the premise has potential but that the film is &quot;needlessly crass and lethally heavy-handed&quot; Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; calls the film &quot;a silly kiddie flick that retreads territory better covered by &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;, &quot;Home Alone&quot; and any number of clones.&quot; He calls the film predictable and finds the comic mayhem difficult to recommend for children.

<text>Keck Graduate Institute (KGI) is a private graduate school in Claremont, California. Founded by Henry Riggs and David Galas in 1997, it is the seventh and newest member of the Claremont Colleges.

==History==
Henry Riggs, then president of Harvey Mudd College, established the institute in 1997 to address what he perceived as a lack of scientists trained to convert new scientific discoveries into practical uses. He also became the institute&#x27;s first president, serving until 2003. David J. Galas, co-founder of the 7th Claremont College, working closely with the visionary President, Henry Riggs, then served as the Chief Academic and Scientific Officer, Dean of the Faculty, Norris Professor of Applied Life Sciences.

The decision to establish Keck Graduate Institute as a seventh Claremont College was met with some opposition, particularly from faculty of the other Claremont Colleges who objected to its lack of tenure, and environmentalists who opposed its plans to build a campus next to the Bernard Field Station, an area of undeveloped scrubland. The environmental issue was largely settled when KGI decided to establish its campus at a different location, and other opposition gradually faded.

The institute received a $50 million endowment from the W. M. Keck Foundation, after which it was named. It awarded its first Master of Bioscience degree in 2002.

In 2003, Sheldon Schuster became the second president in the institute&#x27;s history and in 2023, announced his retirement. Schuster took over from Riggs, who became chairman of the school&#x27;s board of trustees. Schuster is a biochemist who previously served as director of the University of Florida&#x27;s biotechnology research program. In 2024, Keck Graduate Institute&#x27;s Board of Trustees named Mohamed Abousalem as KGI&#x27;s third president.

==Academics==

Academic programs at KGI are organized into three schools: School of Applied Life Sciences, School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and School of Medicine. Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). In August 2019, KGI appointed J. Mario Molina as dean of the new School of Medicine.

KGI also has a Master of Science in Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling program accredited by Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling.

==Research centers==
KGI maintains four research centers: the Center for Rare Disease Therapies, the Center for Biomarker Research, the Science Heritage Center and the Amgen Bioprocessing Center. The Amgen Bioprocessing Center was funded by a 2004 grant of $2 million to KGI from Amgen, a pharmaceutical company based in Thousand Oaks, California.

On December 28, 2016, KGI announced a plan to start a Master of Science in Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling program funded by an additional $1.5 million grant from Amgen.

===Spin-off companies===
Ionian Technologies was founded in 2000, and was the first spin-off company to commercialize technology developed at KGI. Ionian focuses on molecular diagnostics for emerging and infectious diseases, and in 2004 was awarded a contract to develop a handheld biothreat detector using isothermal amplification of DNA. Other KGI startups include Zuyder Pharmaceuticals and Claremont BioSolutions.

<doc id="652263" wikidata="Q345331" url="?curid=652263" title="Łańcut">
<text>Łańcut (, ; ; ) is a town in south-eastern Poland, with 18,004 inhabitants, as of 2 June 2009. Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999), it is the capital of Łańcut County.

== History ==
Archeological investigations carried out in the region of Łańcut confirm the existence of human settlements from about 4000 years B.C.

The first owner of the town was Otton (&quot;z Pilczy&quot;) Pilecki, who was given the Łańcut estate by the Polish king, Casimir III the Great, in 1349, as a reward for his service. At the same time, the king also granted Łańcut its city rights according to Magdeburg law. In 1381 Łańcut was officially named a ‘town’ for the first time, by Otton Pilecki, in the foundation charter of the town. Łańcut remained under the ownership of the Pilecki family up to 1586.
The city was then owned consecutively by aristocratic Polish families of Stadnicki, Lubomirski, and Potocki. Łańcut was purchased by Stanisław Lubomirski in 1629, at which time he secured the services of architect Matteo () Trapola and the stuccoist Giovanni Battista Falconi, in order to build a fortified residence in the town, Łańcut Castle, completed in 1641 and reconstructed many times since. Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, fearing attack from the Swedes, further strengthened the fortifications. To perform these works he employed Tylman van Gameren, a Dutchman and one of the most prominent foreign architects to ever work in Poland.

The castle is situated in the centre of the town and constructed in the style of a grand aristocratic palace-residence. It was last owned until 1944 by the Potocki family, and made infamous in late 16th century during the times of Stanisław Stadnicki, who was known as &#x27;the Devil of Łańcut&#x27; &quot;(Polish: diabeł łańcucki)&quot; for his violent behaviour. After 1775 the palace was owned by Izabella Lubomirska, who extended it and had the interiors remodelled. The palace is currently a museum particularly well known for its large collection of historic carriages. Since 1961, a well-known classical music festival is held there annually.

In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, Łańcut became part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria where it remained until 1918 when it became part of reborn independent Poland. In the 1830s, Ignacy Łukasiewicz, Polish pharmacist and inventor, known as the pioneer of the world&#x27;s petroleum industry, was an apprentice in a pharmacy in Łańcut. At that time he joined the Polish secret resistance movement, and the Austrian police conducted the first investigation against him.
At the end of the 18th century, Duchess Izabela Lubomirska established a distillery on the vast estate of the Lubomirski family in Łańcut. Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki, a grandson and heir of the Duchess, started to run the Łańcut and Lwów Lubomirski estates in 1823. He modernised the management of these properties. The distillery has changed ownership several times and now exists under the name of Polmos Łańcut. It is well known for producing flavoured and sweetened vodkas.

Jews began to settle in Łańcut in the 16th century: the earliest mention of a settler is 1554. The landowner Stanisław Lubomirski employed a Jewish factor for his Łańcut estate in 1629. in 1707 the Council of Four Lands (the Polish Jewish parliament). met in Łańcut. A wooden synagogue burnt down in 1716 and new brick synagogue was commenced in 1726. The project was supported by the Lubomirski family and the synagogue, which still stands, was completed in 1761 (see below). Local Jewish cemeteries are the resting place of the famous Rabbi Zvi Naftali Horowitz, the Grand Rabbi of Ropczyce and Rabbi Ahron Moshe Leifer, the Grand Rabbi of Żołynia. Every year, followers of the Hasidic Judaism come to pray at their graves.

Within interwar Poland, Łańcut was a county seat administratively located in the Lwów Voivodeship. Prior to World War II, Łańcut had a thriving Jewish community constituting about one-third of the city population. In 1939 there were 2,750 Jews in Łańcut. The 10th Mounted Rifle Regiment of the Polish Army was stationed in Łańcut in the interbellum.

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on September 9, 1939, Łańcut was a place of fierce defense by Poles under the command of Colonel Stanisław Maczek, who would become one of the Polish heroes of World War II. During the subsequent German occupation, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town between September 17 and October 5, 1939, to commit various atrocities against Poles. In November 1939, the Germans deceitfully requested the presence of Polish intelligentsia from the town and county at a supposed conference on the county&#x27;s economic matters, at which they then arrested over 200 people, including local officials, teachers and priests (see &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;). Some of them were imprisoned in Rzeszów along with Poles from other towns of the region. A temporary prisoner-of-war camp for Polish soldiers was operated in Łańcut in 1939, and around 25,000 people were held there in mid-November 1939. Nevertheless, the Polish resistance movement was organized in the town, and since May 1940, underground Polish newspaper &quot;Odwet&quot; was distributed in Łańcut. From 1942 onwards the German occupiers began transportation and murder of the Jewish community; very few of the community survived. The Germans executed several Poles in the town for rescuing Jews, while at least one Polish man managed to escape and survive. There is also a well-known case where a Jewish family from Łańcut was hidden from the Germans by the Polish Ulma family in the nearby village of Markowa. In 1944 the Germans discovered the hideout and murdered the Polish family and two hidden Jewish families, 16 people in total, including children. The town&#x27;s architecture avoided significant damage during the war.

The last owner of Łańcut, Alfred Antoni Potocki, (14 June 1886 – 30 March 1958), was one of the richest men in prewar Poland, accumulating a fantastic collection of art during his tenancy. Shortly before the arrival of the Red Army in 1944, he loaded 11 railway carriages of a specially chartered train to Vienna, with his most valuable possessions (about 700 boxes of movable property) and fled to Liechtenstein. Most of these valuables were gradually sold off to finance a lavish lifestyle.

The Music Festival in Łańcut has been an annual event since 1961. The Festival is a series of modern and classical music concerts performed by distinguished European soloists, ensembles and choirs.

== Main sights ==

* The Łańcut Castle, also called the Lubomirski and Potocki Palace. It was built in 1628–1641 by Stanisław Lubomirski, rebuilt in 1894–1903 in the style of French Neo-baroque. In the castle grounds there is a park with the little romantic castle, a coachhouse with a collection of carriages, a guest-house in the English style and other structures. The castle complex is a Historic Monument of Poland.
* The Łańcut Synagogue, completed in 1761. German invaders in 1939 attempted to burn the synagogue down, but were prevented by Count Alfred Antoni Potocki. Although plain on the exterior, the interior walls and ceiling are decorated with restorations of paintings and stuccowork from the 18th century and polychromies from the 19th – 20th centuries.

<text>The London Underground 1973 Stock is a type of rolling stock used on the Piccadilly line of the London Underground. It was introduced into service in 1975 with the extension of the line to Hatton Cross, followed by a further extension to Heathrow Central in 1977. A total of 86 six-car trains were built.

The trains were built by Metro-Cammell between 1974 and 1977, and were refurbished by Bombardier Transportation between 1996 and 2001. They are some of the oldest trains running on the Underground, and in Britain as a whole, second only to the 1972 Stock running on the Bakerloo line.

==History==

In the early 1970s London Transport placed an order for a new fleet of trains to replace the 1938 Stock and 1959 Stock vehicles which previously operated on the Piccadilly line. Built between 1974 and 1977 by Metro Cammell in Birmingham, the first unit entered service on 19 July 1975 and the last was introduced by 1977. The trains featured longer cars and larger door space than the previous units, being designed for airport travellers with luggage.

The order was for 6-car trains, made up of 196 driving motor (DM) cars, 175 trailer (T) cars and 154 uncoupling non-driving motor (UNDM) cars. Each train is made up of two 3-car units, and most units are single-ended, formed DM-T-UNDM. There are also 21 double-ended units, formed DM-T-DM, to provide additional flexibility and to operate the Aldwych shuttle (now closed).

The initial order included two test units equipped with solid state traction equipment and electronic control systems. These were double-ended units 892-692-893 (delivered 1977) and 894-694-895 (delivered 1979), and were known collectively as the ETT (Experimental Tube Train). The first unit was equipped by Westinghouse, the second by GEC. In order to provide additional units for the opening of the Heathrow loop, these units were converted to standard at Acton Works, entering service between 1986 and 1987.

One three-car unit (166-566-366) was damaged in a terrorist attack on 7 July 2005 and subsequently scrapped.

==Refurbishment==
From 1996 to 2001, the entire fleet was refurbished by Bombardier Prorail at Horbury railway works. The interior was completely remodelled, with changes including the removal of transverse seating, replacement of the original wooden flooring with new floor material, replacement of straphangers with new grab rails, new enclosures for the ceiling ventilation fans, brighter lighting with new diffusers, installation of car-end windows and new perch seats in the centre of the cars, creating more luggage space for airport passengers.

The original unpainted exterior was painted in London Underground&#x27;s corporate livery, and a new emergency detrainment system was fitted in the cabs. The external destination blinds were also replaced with LCDs, and these were subsequently replaced with new LED units in 2015.

Interior dot-matrix displays were also introduced around this time, with later refurbished trains having a more compact surrounding than earlier refurbished cars.

The first refurbished unit re-entered service in June 1996, with the final refurbished unit re-entering service on 10 July 2001.

==Future replacement==

The Deep tube programme (DTP) originally covered the replacement of the trains and signalling on the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, and had been expanded to cover rolling stock requirements arising from the planned extension of the Northern line to Battersea, the eventual replacement of Central line trains, and proposed increased service frequency on the Northern and Jubilee lines. The EVO tube concept design, a lighter articulated train with walk-through cars, was introduced early in 2011. 

In early 2014 the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Central and Waterloo &amp; City line rolling stock replacement project was renamed New Tube for London (NTfL) and moved from its feasibility stage to the design and specification stage. The proposal introduces fully automated trains and signalling to increase capacity first on the Piccadilly line in 2025, followed by the Central, Waterloo &amp; City, and Bakerloo lines by 2033. The fully automated trains may not have drivers. The ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying it would be unsafe.

In June 2018, TfL announced 94 nine-car 2024 stock trains to replace the 1973 Stock. As of early 2021, these are expected to enter service from 2025.

<text>The 1959 Tube Stock was a type of London Underground tube train constructed in the late 1950s. They were intended for use on the Piccadilly line, but also saw use on several other tube lines. It was the first production tube stock to have unpainted aluminium alloy bodywork.

==Construction==
The 1959 Stock was built by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham and were closely based on the prototype aluminium alloy bodied 1956 Stock. As with the 1956 stock, the DM cars seated 42, the NDM and T cars seated 40 each. They were initially built for service on the Piccadilly line, where they first entered service on 14 December 1959. It operated at various times on the Northern, Bakerloo, Central and Piccadilly lines. The units had a long career, with a few examples remaining in service until 2000, three years beyond their intended withdrawal date.

The 1959 Stock entered service on the Piccadilly line, but most units were first drafted to the Central line because that line&#x27;s &quot;Standard stock&quot; was becoming very unreliable. The Central line&#x27;s version of the 1959 stock, the 1962 stock, later took over.

==Transfer from the Piccadilly line==

The Piccadilly line extension to Heathrow, which opened in the late 1970s, coincided with the introduction of new 1973 Stock. Therefore, the 1959 Stock was transferred to the Northern line between 1975 and 1979, allowing the scrapping of the oldest 1938 Stock on that line. The 1959 Stock also saw service on the Bakerloo line from 1983 to 1989, again to facilitate withdrawal of 1938 Stock, before being replaced by the 1972 Mk2 Stock in 1989. Although never assigned to it, the 1959 trains are also known to have run occasional service on the Jubilee line following its 1979 split from the Bakerloo.

When new, the 1959 stock was seen as distinctive because of the clean &#x27;silver&#x27; exterior. Over the years, however, the trains&#x27; unpainted exteriors became jaded and dirty. The blue and grey interiors dated quickly. Stylistically the 1959 stock looked worn, but without the aesthetic red and green charm or old-fashioned thirties ambience of the more celebrated 1938 stock.

In the early 1970s, red stabling lights were added next to the units&#x27; twin headlamps when the use of oil tail lamps were withdrawn.

By the mid-1990s, these units were getting old and were in need of works attention. By this time, all the remaining 1959 Stock was concentrated on the Northern line. Minor refurbishment of the stock took place, painting the blue/grey interiors white and replacing some of the seat moquettes, while safety modifications and line identity schemes were retrofitted to the units. This was done in a haphazard manner, the white interiors becoming very dirty inside by 1998, and with a failure rate that had risen to 1 in , the 1959 Stock was in urgent need of replacement.

==Replacement==

New trains in the form of 1995 Stock were built as replacements for both the 1959 stock and the 30 trains of 1972 stock also operating on the Northern line. Originally it had been planned to keep the 1972 stock running with the new trains, with the same extensive refurbishment as done to the 1972 stock on the Bakerloo line, but after one trial refurbishment of a Northern line 1972 stock carriage it was decided that it would be more cost-effective in the long run to have the line operated by one type of train only. Withdrawal of the 1959 Stock was a drawn-out affair, and when the last example was withdrawn on 27 January 2000, it was the last remaining tube train to be crewed with a motorman and a guard. One unit was repainted in &quot;heritage&quot; red and cream livery in 1990 to commemorate the line&#x27;s 100th anniversary. One trailer forms part of the Central Line Sandite train, the other cars were the 1962 stock.

Several vehicles have been preserved, at various locations, including one complete 4-car unit (1304). The complete list is shown below.

<text>Ponginae , also known as the Asian hominids, is a subfamily in the family Hominidae. Once a diverse lineage of Eurasian apes, the subfamily has only one extant genus, &quot;Pongo&quot; (orangutans), which contains three extant species; the Sumatran orangutan (&quot;Pongo abelii&quot;), the Tapanuli orangutan (&quot;Pongo tapanuliensis&quot;) and the Bornean orangutan (&quot;Pongo pygmaeus&quot;). All three species are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Evolutionary history==
The first pongine genera appear in the Miocene, &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; and &quot;Khoratpithecus&quot;, six or seven million years before evidence of orangutans was found from Pleistocene southeast Asia and southern China. Ponginae may also include the genera &quot;Lufengpithecus&quot;, &quot;Ankarapithecus&quot;, and &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;. However, phylogenetic analysis in 2004, which originally found &quot;Lufengpithecus&quot; and &quot;Ankarapithecus&quot; to be most closely related to the orangutan, gave different results &quot;under an analytical method that attempted to reduce stratigraphic incongruence&quot;, instead placing them on the base of the stem of the African ape-human clade.

&quot;Meganthropus&quot; was considered by the majority of paleoanthropologists as falling within the variation of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. However, a study from 2019 of tooth morphology found &quot;Meganthropus&quot; a valid genus of non-hominin hominid ape, most closely related to &quot;Lufengpithecus&quot;

The most well-known fossil genus of Ponginae is &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;, consisting of several species from 12.5 million to 8.5 million years ago. It differs from orangutans in dentition and postcranial morphology.

<text>Ustrzyki Dolne (; , ) is a town in south-eastern Poland, situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999) close to the border with Ukraine. It is the capital of Bieszczady County, with 9,383 inhabitants 

In existence since the 15th century, Ustrzyki received its city charter around 1727. During the First Partition of Poland, in 1772 it became part of the Habsburg monarchy where it remained until 1918. After the defeat of Austria-Hungary Ustrzyki became part of the newly independent Poland. Major growth of the Ustrzyki economy began in the 19th century, when a railway connection to Przemyśl and Sanok was built in 1872, and the exploitation of local oil fields began. Temporarily in the USSR after the Vistula–Oder Offensive in 1944–45, it became part of postwar Poland following the 1951 Polish-Soviet territorial exchange.

The word &quot;Dolne&quot; means &quot;Lower&quot;. There exists a village Ustrzyki Górne - &quot;Upper&quot;.

==Timeline of history==
*1497, Foundation of Ustrzyki Dolne as a royal village in the district Przemyśl
*1723, Old town is built. First Jews appear in the town
*1772, Ustrzyki Dolne together with Galicia becomes part of the Austrian Empire
*1800–1850, Ustrzyki Dolne is part of the district Sanok (Königreich Galizien)
*1850–1918, Ustrzyki Dolne is part of the district Lisko
*During World War I, Ustrzyki Dolne was occupied for six months by the Russian army and in 1918 for two months by Ukrainian troops.
*1919–1939, Ustrzyki Dolne is part of the Lwów Voivodeship. On 1 January 1939 in city lived 4,300 residents (550 Ukrainians, 1,150 Polish people, 2,600 Jews).
*1939 September, Occupation by German troops. 100 Jews are killed. Soon transferred to Soviet Union as part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact
*1939–1941, Soviet annexation. Part of the Drohobych Oblast
*1941–1944, German occupation. The city is initially taken by Slovak troops and transferred under the German administration. Jewish population is killed in the town or deported to Belzec where they are immediately gassed. Probably only ten or fewer of Ustrzyki Dolne&#x27;s prewar Jewish population survived the war.
*1944–1951, Soviet administration. Part of the Drohobych Oblast
*1951–1974, As part of a land swap with the Soviet Union, Ustrzyki Dolne becomes Polish again and is part of the province Rzeszów.
*1974–1998, Ustrzyki Dolne becomes part of the Krosno Voivodeship.
*1998, Ustrzyki Dolne becomes part of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (capital Rzeszów)

<text>The dusky smooth-hound (Mustelus canis), also called the smooth dogfish or the dog shark, is a species of houndshark in the family Triakidae. This shark is an olive grey or brown in color, and may have shades of yellow or grayish white. Females live to 16 years and males have a lifespan of 10 years. &quot;M. canis&quot; was the first shark recognised to have viral infections.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;M. canis&quot; can be known as smooth dogfish, Atlantic smooth dogfish, dusky smooth-hound, grayish, nurse shark, smooth dog, or smooth-hound. It was originally named &quot;Squalls canis&quot;. In Latin, &quot;mustelus&quot; translates to weasel and &quot;canis&quot; translates to dog. &quot;M. canis&quot; has an allopatric relationship with &quot;M. mustelus&quot; (common smooth-hound) and a sympatric relationship with &quot;M. norrisi&quot; (narrowfin smooth-hound).

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;M. canis&quot; is found in marine and brackish waters and is demersal (bottom-dwelling) and oceanodromous (migratory in seas). They can be found between 42°N and 44°S and 100 and 46°W. &quot;M. canis&quot; in the North Atlantic migrates in response to changing temperature. In winter, they can be found in the Carolinas to the outlet of the Chesapeake Bay, and in summer from the mid-Atlantic to southern New England. They are most abundant on the East Coast, from Massachusetts to Florida, Brazil to Argentina, and in the Gulf of Mexico. They are mostly found in waters shallower than 60 ft (18 m), but can be found to 665 ft (200 m) deep.

== Anatomy and appearance ==
Smooth dogfish are relatively small and slender. They have elongated, oval-shaped eyes with a spiracle located directly behind on each side. They have triangular fins. Their first and second dorsal fins are well-serrated and nearly equal in size. The second dorsal fin is slightly smaller than the first and twice as large as the anal fin. The caudal fin has two asymmetrical lobes, the lower is smaller and rounder and the upper has a deep notch. They do not have any fin spines, unlike the spiny dogfish. They have a tapering, blunt snout. They can be gray to brown and their undersides can be white to yellowish gray. Smooth dogfish have the ability to change colors using melanophores to help them camouflage. Newborns have lighter gray edges on their fins and have tail fins edged in white. On average, smooth dogfish are about 48 in long, but can reach up to 5 ft. They have an inter-dorsal ridge.

=== Dentition ===
One main characteristic of elasmobranch fishes is their ability to continually replace the teeth in their upper and lower jaws. Smooth dogfish differ from other sharks because of their 10 rows of flat, blunt teeth. The teeth in the upper and lower jaws are similar in size and are asymmetrical with rounded cusps. These teeth are used to crush and grind food, rather than bite it. Their unique dentition is important for their crustacean-based diet.

In smooth dogfish, tooth replacement is related to body growth. They grow about 10 cm per every six rows of teeth replaced. That is an increase of 0.03 mm per replaced tooth. Teeth are replaced at a rate of one row per 10 to 12 days.

== Diet ==
&quot;M. canis&quot; feeds mostly on crustaceans, polychaetes, and mollusks. Smooth dogfish also eat squid, worms, small fish, razor clams, and sometimes scavenge discarded animal products. They are nocturnal scavengers and opportunistic predators. Their nocturnal activity helps them to take advantage of concentrations of crustacean prey.

== Reproduction ==
The mating season of smooth dogfish is from May to June. They are viviparous and have a yolk-sac placenta. Females can store sperm up to a year, but how long it can be used is not known. Their gestation period is 10 to 11 months and litters can be between four and 20 pups. The pups are 13 to 15 in (34 to 39 cm) long when born. Males reach sexual maturity between 2 and 3 years or 68 and 93 cm in length. Females reach sexual maturity between 4 and 5 years or 70 and 130 cm in length. Smooth dogfish have a relatively low population doubling time of 4.5 to 14 years. Because of their late maturation, low fecundity, and restricted distributions, they are still more vulnerable to overfishing than teleost fishes.

Juvenile females have filiform uteri, small ovaries with undifferentiated oocyctes, egg cells, and narrow, thread-like oviducts with undeveloped oviducal glands. Adolescents have enlarged oviducal glands with distinguishable oocytes and no or few corpora lutea. Adults have large ovaries and vitellogenic oocytes. Spermatozoa has been observed in preovulatory females.

Juvenile males have soft, small claspers and undeveloped testes with straight, thread-like ampullae ductus deferens. Adolescents&#x27; testes have increased weight and claspers are extended and calcified, but are still flexible. Adults have fully formed and calcified claspers and large and developed testes.

== Relationship to humans ==
Commercial fisheries have had an increased interest in smooth dogfish since the 1900s. They are caught using longlines and bottom trawls primarily off of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Mostly, they are considered bycatch when fishing for other species, which has put them in the near-threatened category by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They are no danger to humans because of their blunt teeth.
== Tonic immobility ==
Tonic immobility has been reported in several cartilaginous fishes, one of which is &quot;M. canis.&quot; Tonic immobility is induced by grasping the first dorsal fin with one hand and the body immediately anterior to the anal fin with the other, inverting the shark and holding it rigidly. The mean time to induce tonic immobility in smooth dogfish was 32.5 seconds. The mean duration of the tonic immobility was 61.9 seconds. Sharks that had the &quot;limp&quot; response also exhibited tonic immobility. The &quot;limp&quot; response is a criterion for the onset of tonic immobility.

<text>Philippe Halsman (; ; 2 May 1906 – 25 June 1979) was an American portrait photographer. He was born in Riga in the part of the Russian Empire which later became Latvia, and died in New York City.

==Life and work==

Halsman was born in Riga to a Jewish couple, Morduch (Maks) Halsman, a dentist, and Ita Grintuch, a grammar school principal. He studied electrical engineering in Dresden.

In September 1928, 22-year-old Halsman was accused of his father&#x27;s murder while they were on a hiking trip in the Austrian Tyrol, an area rife with antisemitism. After a trial based on circumstantial evidence, he was sentenced to four years of prison. His family, friends and barristers worked for his release, getting support from Thomas Mann and various important European Jewish intellectuals including Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, Jakob Wassermann, Erich Fromm, Paul Painlevé, Heinrich Eduard Jacob and Rudolf Olden, who endorsed his innocence. Halsman spent two years in prison, where he contracted tuberculosis. His letters from prison were published as a book in 1930: &quot;Briefe aus der Haft an eine Freundin&quot;. He was pardoned by the President of Austria, Wilhelm Miklas, and released in October 1930.

Halsman left Austria for France, began contributing photographs to fashion magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, and soon gained a reputation as one of the best portrait photographers in France, renowned for images that were sharp rather than in soft focus as was often used, and closely cropped. When France was invaded by Germany, Halsman fled to Marseille. He eventually managed to obtain a U.S. visa, aided by family friend Albert Einstein (whom he later famously photographed in 1947).

Halsman had his first success in America when the cosmetics firm Elizabeth Arden used his image of model Constance Ford against the American flag in an advertising campaign for &quot;Victory Red&quot; lipstick. A year later, in 1942, he found work with &quot;Life&quot; magazine, photographing hat designs; a portrait of a model in a Lilly Daché hat was the first of his 101 covers for &quot;Life&quot;.
In 1941 Halsman met the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí; they began to collaborate in the late 1940s. The 1948 work &quot;Dalí Atomicus&quot; explores the idea of suspension, depicting three cats flying, a bucket of thrown water, and Dalí in mid air. The title of the photograph is a reference to Dalí&#x27;s work &quot;Leda Atomica&quot; which can be seen in the right of the photograph behind the two cats. Halsman reported that it took 28 attempts before a satisfactory result was achieved. Halsman and Dalí eventually released a compendium of their collaborations in the 1954 book &quot;Dali&#x27;s Mustache&quot;, which features 36 different views of the artist&#x27;s distinctive mustache. Another famous collaboration between the two was &quot;&quot;, a surrealistic portrait of Dalí beside a &quot;tableau vivant&quot; of seven nude women posed to look like a large skull. Halsman took three hours to arrange the models according to a sketch by Dalí. Various re-enactments of and allusions to &quot;In Voluptas Mors&quot; have appeared over the years; most famously, a version was used subtly in the poster for the film &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot;, while an overt reenactment appeared on a promotional poster for &quot;The Descent&quot;.

In 1947 Halsman photographed a mournful Albert Einstein, who during the session recounted his regrets about his role in the United States pursuing the atomic bomb; this became one of Halsman&#x27;s most famous photographs. The photo was later used in 1966 on a U.S. postage stamp and, in 1999, on the cover of &quot;Time magazine&quot;, when it called Einstein the &quot;Person of the Century.&quot;

In 1951 Halsman was commissioned by NBC to photograph various popular comedians of the time including Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Groucho Marx, and Bob Hope. While photographing the comedians doing their acts, he captured many of the comedians jumping, in mid-air, which went on to inspire many later jump pictures of celebrities including the Ford family, The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Marilyn Monroe, María Félix and Richard Nixon.&lt;ref name=&quot;magnumphotos/halsman-jump&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Halsman commented, &quot;When you ask a person to jump, his attention is mostly directed toward the act of jumping and the mask falls so that the real person appears.&quot; The photographer developed a philosophy of jump photography, which he called jumpology. He published &quot;Philippe Halsman&#x27;s Jump Book&quot; in 1959, which contained a tongue-in-cheek discussion of jumpology and 178 photographs of celebrity jumpers.

His 1961 book &quot;Halsman on the Creation of Photographic Ideas&quot;, discussed ways for photographers to produce unusual pieces of work by following six rules:

* the rule of the direct approach
* the rule of the unusual technique
* the rule of the added unusual feature
* the rule of the missing feature
* the rule of compounded features
* the rule of the literal or ideographic method

In his first rule, Halsman explains that being straightforward and plain creates a strong photograph.

To make an ordinary and uninteresting subject interesting and unusual, his second rule lists a variety of photographic techniques, including unusual lighting, unusual angle, unusual composition, etc.

The rule of the added unusual feature is an effort by the photographer to capture the audiences attention by drawing their eye to something unexpected by introducing an unusual feature or prop into the photograph. 
For example, the photograph of a little boy holding a hand grenade by Diane Arbus contains what Halsman would call an added unusual feature.

Halsman&#x27;s fourth rule of &quot;the missing feature&quot; stimulates the viewer by going against his or her expectations.

The fifth rule enlists the photographer to combine the other rules to add originality to his or her photo.

Finally, Halsman&#x27;s literal or ideographic method is to illustrate a message in a photograph by depicting the subject as clearly as possible.

Other celebrities photographed by Halsman include Alfred Hitchcock and François Truffaut during their 1962 interview, Martin and Lewis, Judy Garland, Winston Churchill, Marilyn Monroe, Dorothy Dandridge, Pablo Picasso, and Jean Cocteau. Many of those photographs appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot;. In such photos, he utilizes a variety of his rules of photography. For example, in one of his photos of Winston Churchill, the omission of his face makes Halsman&#x27;s photo even more powerful at making Churchill more human.

In 1952 John F. Kennedy sat twice for photographs by Halsman. A photograph from the first sitting appeared on the jacket of the original edition of Kennedy&#x27;s book Profiles in Courage; one from the second sitting was used in his senatorial campaign.

In 1958 Halsman was listed in &quot;Popular Photography&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Ten Greatest Photographers&quot;, and in 1975 he received the Life Achievement in Photography Award from the American Society of Magazine Photographers, of which he was elected the first president in 1945. He also held many large exhibitions worldwide.

In 1967 Halsman received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In the 2007 film &quot;Jump!&quot;, Halsman was portrayed by Ben Silverstone.

<doc id="652293" wikidata="Q741182" url="?curid=652293" title="Dissolution of parliament">
<text>The dissolution of a legislative assembly (or parliament) is the simultaneous termination of service of all of its members, in anticipation that a successive legislative assembly will reconvene later with possibly different members. In a democracy, the new assembly is chosen by a general election. Dissolution is distinct on the one hand from abolition of the assembly, and on the other hand from its adjournment or prorogation, or the ending of a legislative session, any of which begins a period of inactivity after which it is anticipated that the same members will reassemble. For example, the &quot;second session of the fifth parliament&quot; could be followed by the &quot;third session of the fifth parliament&quot; after a prorogation, but would be followed by the &quot;first session of the sixth parliament&quot; after a dissolution.

In most Continental European countries, dissolution does not have immediate effect – that is, a dissolution merely triggers an election, but the old assembly itself continues its existing term and its members remain in office until the new assembly convenes for the first time. In those systems, ordinarily scheduled elections are held before the assembly reaches the end of a fixed or maximum term, and do not require a dissolution.

In most Westminster systems, however, a dissolution legally ends the existence of the assembly, resulting in a temporary power vacuum, which may be filled in special circumstances by recalling the old assembly if need be. Because of this peculiarity, Westminster systems also have automatically-triggered dissolutions when the assembly reaches the end of a fixed or maximum term, since the act of dissolution itself is synonymous with the end of the assembly&#x27;s term, and elections cannot be held in anticipation of a dissolution.

Early dissolutions may be possible in parliamentary and semi-presidential systems, to resolve conflicts between the executive and the legislature; either a &quot;snap election&quot; called by an executive seeking to increase its legislative support, or an election triggered by parliament withholding confidence and supply from the government. Some presidential systems also allow early dissolutions, usually by the legislature voting to dissolve itself (as in Cyprus), but sometimes by executive action in more authoritarian presidential systems, or, as in Ecuador&#x27;s &quot;muerte cruzada&quot;, the president dissolving the legislature at the cost of facing a new election themselves.

In a bicameral legislature, dissolution may apply jointly or separately to the lower house and upper house, or may apply only to the lower house, with the upper house never fully dissolved. In a bicameral Westminster system, the expression &quot;dissolution of parliament&quot; typically refers to the dissolution of the lower house, just as &quot;member of parliament&quot; means member of the lower house.

== Australia ==

The House of Representatives, but not the Senate, can be dissolved at any time by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The term of the House expires three years after its first meeting if not dissolved earlier. The governor-general can dissolve the Senate only by also dissolving the House of Representatives (a double dissolution) and only in limited circumstances spelled out in the Constitution.

There is a convention that the Governor-General only orders a dissolution on the advice of the prime minister. This convention was demonstrated in the dismissal of prime minister Gough Whitlam by Governor General Sir John Kerr in 1975. Kerr claimed that dissolving the House of Representatives was his duty and &quot;the only democratic and constitutional solution&quot; to the political deadlock over supply. Whitlam refused to advise Kerr to call an election, and Kerr replaced him with a caretaker prime minister, Malcolm Fraser. Fraser promptly advised a double dissolution, and Sir John acted in accordance with that advice.

=== Parliament of Victoria ===
Unlike the Commonwealth Parliament, the premier and governor of Victoria have very little discretion in dissolving the Parliament of Victoria. Both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council are dissolved automatically twenty-five days before the last Saturday in November every four years. However, the governor can dissolve the Legislative Assembly if a motion of no confidence in the premier and the other ministers of state is passed and no motion of confidence is passed within the next week. Finally, the premier can advise the governor to dissolve both houses in the case of a deadlocked bill.

== Bangladesh ==
In Bangladesh, the dissolution of the Parliament is governed by Article 72 of the Constitution, which states that Parliament shall be summoned, prorogued, and dissolved by the President through public notification. The President exercises this power based on the written advice of the Prime Minister.

Following the dissolution, general elections must be conducted within 90 days. The newly elected Parliament is required to convene within 30 days after the publication of election results.

A notable instance occurred on August 6, 2024, when President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved Parliament after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s resignation amid a mass uprising which led to the formation of an interim government tasked with overseeing the country until new elections could be organized.

Although, Bangladesh’s constitution does not provide explicit provisions for an interim government following such a dissolution, leading to a constitutional crisis during the period. The interim government established a Constitutional Reform Commission to draft a new constitution and prepare for constituent assembly elections.

== Belgium ==

In Belgium, dissolution occurs either by royal order or by law upon a Declaration of Revision of the Constitution (Art. 195 Const.). Since the First World War, elections have always been called with either of these actions, except for 1929. A third scenario, dissolution by law due to a vacant throne, has never occurred.

Dissolution by law dissolves both the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. A royal order originally could dissolve the Chamber, the Senate, or both. However, the last dissolution of one chamber only happened in 1884; both chambers were always dissolved together since then. With the 1993 constitutional reforms, only the Chamber could be dissolved, with the Senate being automatically dissolved as well. Since 2014 constitutional reforms, only the Chamber can be dissolved, as the Senate is no longer directly elected.

After dissolution, elections must be held within 40 days, and the new chambers must convene within three months (within two months from 1831 to 2014).

Parliaments of the regions and communities cannot be dissolved; they have fixed five-year terms.

== Brazil ==
Under the current constitution, there is no formal way to dissolve the Federal Senate or the Chamber of Deputies (Houses of the National Congress).

=== Imperial Era ===
In May 1823, eight months after Independence, the first brazilian legislative experience began, with the installation of the General, Constituent and Legislative Assembly, with the task of drafting the country&#x27;s first Constitution. Six months later, in confrontation with the Deputies, Emperor Dom Pedro dissolved the assembly, ordered the arrest and exile of some deputies and created a Council of State to draft the Constitution, which he signed in 1824.

This was the first of the eighteen times that the legislature was dissolved, the Imperial Constitution and its quasi-parliamentary model formalized the Emperor&#x27;s power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies (the Senate was not elected). During the Regency and reign of Dom Pedro II, the Chamber of Deputies was dissolved on several occasions, almost always when the clash between conservatives and liberals or between legislators and the reached a degree considered too high by the Emperor.

=== First Republic ===

After the Proclamation of the Republic, in 1889, a Constituent Congress was convened to prepare the first republican charter, which came into force in 1891. However, on 3 November of that year, the National Congress would be closed by President Deodoro da Fonseca, with the legislature reinstated after the attempt was deemed a coup and he resigned.

=== Vargas Era ===

The legislature was closed twice by Getúlio Vargas. After the Revolution of 1930, as Head of the Provisional Government, Vargas dissolved the National Congress, the state legislative assemblies and the municipal chambers. Pressured by the failed Constitutionalist Revolution, Vargas was forced to call elections for a National Constituent Assembly.

On 10 November 1937, now President of the Republic elected by the same National Congress, Vargas staged a coup d&#x27;état, establishing the Estado Novo. He closed the legislature and instituted a new, authoritarian Constitution. Despite the new charter determining the convening of a &quot;&quot;National Parliament&quot; with a appointed Federal Council and a Chamber of Deputies that could be dissolved, elections were never held.

=== Republican Parliamentarism ===

During the brief parliamentary experience from 1961 to 1963 as a way to allow the inauguration of President João Goulart under strong political and military opposition, the Additional Act to the Constitution determined that &quot;[v]erified the impossibility of maintaining the Council of Ministers for lack of parliamentary support, proven in motions of no confidence, consecutively opposed to three Councils, the President of the Republic may dissolve the Chamber of Deputies[...]&quot;&quot;.

The then President of the Republic never exercised this attribution and the return to the presidential system stripped him of any competence to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies.

=== Military dictatorship ===

During the twenty-one years of the military dictatorship (1964–1985), the National Congress was &quot;suspended&quot; three times. Institutional Act No. 2 (AI-2) gave the President of the Republic the power to decree the recess of the two Houses of the National Congress, and during this period he had the prerogative to legislate.

On 20 October 1966, President Castelo Branco decreed recess for a month, to contain a &quot;&quot;grouping of counter-revolutionary elements&quot; (the 1964 Coup d&#x27;Etat was considered a revolution by the military) that had formed in the legislature &quot;with the aim of disrupting public peace&quot;. On 13 December 1968, President Costa e Silva issued AI-5, an institutional act that began the most repressive and violent period of the dictatorship, closing the National Congress to combat subversion and &quot;ideologies contrary to the traditions of our people&quot; &quot;.

The last person to decree the closure of the legislature was President Ernesto Geisel, in 1977, through the &quot;April package&quot;, after the National Congress rejected a constitutional amendment. Geisel alleged that the MDB (then the opposition party on a unequal bipartisanship controlled by the military) had established a &quot;minority dictatorship&quot;.

== Canada ==

The House of Commons, but not the Senate, can be dissolved at any time by the King of Canada or by Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. If the government is refused confidence or supply, the prime minister must either resign and permit another member of the House of Commons to form a government, or else advise the governor general to dissolve Parliament. Also, the House of Commons typically dissolves within five years; however, in circumstances such as war, invasion, or insurrection, Parliament may extend this period. A continuation longer than five years requires approval by more than two-thirds of the House of Commons members or the legislative assembly.

The provincial legislatures may also be dissolved at any time for the same reasons, by the Lieutenant Governor on the advice of the provincial premier. All provinces and territories have established fixed election dates.

== Czech Republic ==
The Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic may be dissolved by the president when at least one condition specified by the constitution is fulfilled. The Senate can never be dissolved. After the dissolution, snap elections are to be held no later than after 60 days.

The chamber can be dissolved if
*The chamber does not pass a motion of confidence to the government formed by the prime minister who was recommended by the speaker of the chamber (Who can do so after 2 failed government with a prime minister appointed solely by the president).
*The chamber fails to pass the government proposed law linked to the motion of confidence in 3 months.
*The chamber adjourns its meeting for a time longer than 120 days.
*The chamber is not quorate for a time longer than 3 months.
*The chamber passes a motion of dissolution by a constitutional majority (120 out of 200 deputies must support it). President is obliged to dissolve the chamber if such motion passes.

Since the formation of the Czech Republic, the Chamber of Deputies was only dissolved once. In 2013, by passing a motion of dissolution after a lengthy crisis following the fall of Petr Nečas&#x27; government,

Before such practice was made possible by amending the Constitution in 2009, Chamber of Deputies was once dissolved in 1998 by passing a special constitutional act, which shortened its term, but such practice was blocked by the Constitutional Court, when it was tried again in 2009

== Denmark ==

The government can call an election to the Folketing at any time, and is obliged to call one before the incumbent membership&#x27;s four-year terms expire. However, the Folketing is never formally &quot;dissolved&quot;, and it retains its legislative power until new members have been elected. In practice the Folketing will cancel all its ongoing business when an election is called, to give the members time to campaign, but it can reconvene in case a national emergency requires urgent legislation before the election takes place.

== Ecuador ==
Article 148 of the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador grants the president the power to dissolve the National Assembly, but only at the price of also triggering a fresh election for the president. The mechanism, known as &quot;muerte cruzada&quot; requires that a special election be held following dissolution, in which a new president and vice-president and a new National Assembly are elected. The candidates elected – to both the executive and legislative branches – then serve out the remainder of the current presidential and legislative terms.

The first and only invocation of the dissolution was during the 2023 Ecuadorian political crisis when president Guillermo Lasso, undergoing impeachment proceedings in the National Assembly, dissolved the legislative body. Lasso was eligible to run for re-election, but chose not to. Daniel Noboa, his elected successor and the newly elected National Assembly in 2023 will serve out the rest of the term until 2025.

== Estonia ==
Per Section 60 of the Constitution of Estonia, regular elections to the Riigikogu, Estonia&#x27;s unicameral parliament, are held on the first Sunday of March in the fourth year following the preceding parliamentary election. However, the Riigikogu can be dissolved by the President of Estonia and fresh elections called prior to the expiration of its four-year term if one of the following four circumstances should occur:

# Following the resignation of the outgoing Government, a new Government is unable to be formed according to the procedure established by Section 89 of the Constitution.
# The Riigikogu passes a motion of no confidence in the Government or the prime minister, and the Government proposes (within three days of the no-confidence motion) that the President call an early election.
# The Riigikogu submits a proposed law to a referendum, and that proposed law fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in the referendum, per Section 105 of the Constitution.
# The Riigikogu fails to approve a national budget within two months of the beginning of the financial year, per Section 119 of the Constitution.

In the first, third, and fourth cases above, the President must call an early election. In the second case, however, a Government that has lost the confidence of the Riigikogu is not obliged to request an early election. This occurred in 2016, when Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas lost a no confidence motion. His government resigned, and President Kersti Kaljulaid nominated Jüri Ratas to form the next government without an election taking place.

Likewise, if a Government loses a no confidence vote and requests an early election, the President can refuse the Government&#x27;s request if it appears a successor government could command the support of the Riigikogu.

As of 2018, every convocation of the Riigikogu has run its full term.

== Finland ==

The President of Finland can dissolve the parliament and call for an early election. As per the version of the 2000 constitution currently in use, the president can do this only upon proposal by the prime minister and after consultations with the parliamentary groups while the Parliament is in session. In prior versions of the constitution, the President had the power to do this unilaterally.

== France ==

Under the French Fourth Republic formed after World War II, there was originally a weak role for the president of France. However, when Charles de Gaulle, who favored a presidential government with a strong executive, was invited to form a new government and constitution during the May 1958 crisis he directed the constitutional committee chaired by Michel Debré to increase the authority of the presidency, including providing the ability to dissolve the National Assembly.

Under Article 12 of the 1958 French Constitution, the National Assembly can be dissolved by the President at any time after consultation with the prime minister and the presidents of the two chambers of Parliament. After the declaration, new elections must be held within twenty to forty days. The National Assembly elected following such a dissolution cannot be dissolved within the first year of its term.

A dissolution of the National Assembly most recently occurred when in June 2024, when President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly to prompt the 2024 French legislative election. President Jacques Chirac previously dissolved the National Assembly before the 1997 French legislative election in order to secure a new parliament more sympathetic to his policies, which ultimately failed when the opposition Socialist Party won the election against Chirac&#x27;s party the Rally for the Republic.

== Germany ==

According to the Basic Law, the Bundestag can be dissolved by the federal president if the chancellor loses a vote of confidence, or if a newly elected Bundestag proves unable to elect a chancellor with absolute majority. The second possibility has never occurred, but the Bundestag was dissolved in 1972, 1982, and 2005 when the then-ruling chancellors Willy Brandt, Helmut Kohl, and Gerhard Schröder deliberately lost votes of confidence in order that there could be fresh elections. On the last two occasions, the decree of dissolution was challenged without success before the Constitutional Court. No president has yet refused a dissolution of the Bundestag when the choice came to him.

The Bundestag is automatically dissolved four years after the last general election, and most Bundestags have lasted the full term.

The second federal legislative body, the Bundesrat, cannot be dissolved, as its members are the federal states&#x27; governments as such rather than specific individuals.

== Hong Kong ==
The chief executive, who is the head of the territory and head of government, has the power to dissolve the Legislative Council under Article 51 of the Hong Kong Basic Law:
* if the Legislative Council fails to pass the appropriation bill or any other important bill; or
* if Legislative Council passes a bill but the chief executive refuses to give assent and returns the bill, after which the Council passes the bill again with a two-thirds majority and the Chief Executive again refuses to give assent.

Before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, the Legislative Council could be dissolved any time at the governor&#x27;s pleasure.

== India ==

Legislative power is constitutionally vested in the Parliament of India, of which the President is the head, to facilitate the law-making process as per the Constitution. The President summons both the Houses (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha) of the parliament and prorogues them. They also have the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha pursuant to Article 75(2)(b). When Parliament is dissolved, all bills pending within the Lok Sabha lapse. However, bills in the Rajya Sabha never lapse, and can remain pending for decades.

== Indonesia ==

The Constitution of Indonesia prohibits President to dissolve the House of Representatives. This principle was originally written in the explanatory memorandum to the Constitution but was moved to the main body (precisely in article 7C) since the explanatory memorandum was eliminated in the Third Amendment.

Despite this, there was a constitutional crisis in 2001 when President Abdurrahman Wahid attempted to prorogue the DPR on 23 July 2001 through a presidential decree.

== Republic of Ireland ==

Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Oireachtas) can be dissolved by the President, on the advice of the taoiseach (prime minister). The president may only deny such a dissolution if the taoiseach has lost the confidence of the Dáil, through a vote of no confidence (or, it could be argued after a Budget or other important bill has failed to pass). This has never happened, and, in the past, taoisigh have requested dissolutions before votes of no confidence have taken place, so as to force a general election rather than a handover of Government. A Dáil must be dissolved, and then a general election held, within five years of its first meeting.

There are two notable instances when the President did not dissolve Dáil Éireann: 1989 and 1994. In the first instance, the newly elected Dáil failed to elect a Taoiseach when it first met (and at a number of meetings afterward). The incumbent taoiseach Charles Haughey was obliged constitutionally to resign, however, he initially refused to. He eventually tendered his resignation to President Patrick Hillery and remained as taoiseach in an acting capacity. At the fourth attempt, the Dáil eventually re-elected Haughey as taoiseach. Had he requested a dissolution, it would probably have been accepted by the President on the grounds that the Dáil could not form a Government, but the President would have also been within his rights to refuse it. It is thought that Haughey chose not to do so but instead to go into a historic coalition because of poor opinion polls showing his Fianna Fáil party would lose seats in a second General Election.

In 1994, Albert Reynolds resigned as taoiseach when the Labour Party left a coalition with Fianna Fáil, but did not request a dissolution, in order that his successor in Fianna Fáil might forge a new coalition with Labour. Labour, however, went into Government with the main opposition party, Fine Gael. It has been speculated that the president at the time, Mary Robinson, would not have allowed a dissolution had Reynolds requested one. To date, no president has ever refused a dissolution.

One feature of the Irish system is that although the Dáil is dissolved, the Seanad Éireann (the Senate) is not, and may continue to meet during an election campaign for the Dáil. However, as many members of the Seanad are typically involved in election campaigns for the Dáil, the Seanad does not typically meet often, if at all, once the Dáil is dissolved. A general election for the Seanad must take place within 90 days of the election of the new Dáil.

== Italy ==
The president of Italy has the authority to dissolve parliament, and consequently call for new elections, until which the powers of the old parliament are extended; however, the President loses this authority during the so-called &quot;semestre bianco&quot;, the last six months of his seven-year term, unless that period coincides at least in part with the final six months of the Parliament&#x27;s five-year term, as stated in Article 88 of the Constitution of Italy: &quot;In consultation with the presiding officers of Parliament, the President may dissolve one or both Houses of Parliament. The President of the Republic may not exercise such right during the final six months of the presidential term unless said period coincides in full or in part with the final six months of Parliament.&quot;

After the resignation of the Cabinet of Italy, which can be freely decided by the prime minister, or caused by a vote of no confidence by the Parliament, or after general elections, the President has to consult the speakers of the two houses of Parliament, the delegations of the parliamentary groups, and senators for life to find someone who might be appointed prime minister and lead a new government with the confidence of both Houses. The President dissolves Parliament only if the groups fail to find an agreement to form a majority coalition; the actual power of dissolution is in practice also shared by the Parliament, political parties, and by the outgoing prime minister. Since the Constitution of Italy came into force in 1948, the Italian Parliament has been dissolved nine times before the end of its five-year term, in 1972, 1976, 1979, 1983, 1987, 1994, 1996, 2008 and 2022.

== Israel ==

In Israel, early elections to the Knesset can be called before the scheduled date of the third Tuesday in the Jewish month of Cheshvan (late September through early November) four years after the previous elections if the prime minister calls early elections with Presidential approval due to gridlock, if no government is formed after 42 days of consultation with parties&#x27; floor leaders in the Knesset, if the budget is not approved by the Knesset by 31 March (3 months after the start of the fiscal year), or if half of the Knesset members vote in favor of early elections. This call for early elections is legally called the &quot;Dissolution of the Knesset&quot;.

However, strictly speaking, the Knesset is only truly dissolved in the sense of being unconstituted and all MKs losing their seats automatically 14 days after elections, simultaneously with the start of the newly elected Knesset&#x27;s term.

== Japan ==
In Japan, the House of Representatives of the National Diet (parliament) can be dissolved at any time by the emperor, on the advice of the Cabinet, headed by the prime minister. The Constitution of Japan specifies that all members of the House can serve up to a four-year term. So far, however, parliaments have been dissolved prematurely with the exception of 9 December 1976 and 31 October 2021 dissolution.

The House of Councillors, however, cannot be dissolved but only closed, and may, in times of national emergency, be convoked for an emergency session. Its members serve a fixed six-year term, with half of the seats, and the Speaker of the Councillors, up for re-election every three years.

The emperor both convokes the Diet and dissolves the House of Representatives, but only does so on the advice of the Cabinet.

== New Zealand ==
The Parliament can be dissolved or prorogued at any time during its three-year term by the governor-general, usually on the advice of the prime minister.

== Norway ==
According to the Constitution of Norway, the Storting (parliament) cannot be dissolved before serving its full four-year term.

== Pakistan ==
The National Assembly of Pakistan, the country&#x27;s lower house, dissolves automatically at the end of its five-year term, after which general elections must be held within 60 days. The upper house, called the Senate, cannot be dissolved.

The prime minister can also advise the president to dissolve the National Assembly. The president is bound to do so within 48 hours after receiving the prime minister&#x27;s summary, after which time the National Assembly is automatically dissolved.
Before the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan came into effect, the president could dissolve the National Assembly without the prime minister&#x27;s advice by using Article 58-2(B) of the Constitution.

== Peru ==

Under the Peruvian Constitution of 1993, the president of Peru has the authority to dissolve the Congress of Peru if a vote of no confidence is passed three times by the legislative body, and has four months to call for new parliamentary elections or faces impeachment.

The Congress of Peru has been dissolved twice; once in 1992 by President Alberto Fujimori who performed an auto-coup in April 1992 by dismantling both the legislative and judicial branches of government, and once by incumbent President Martín Vizcarra, who dissolved the Congress in October 2019 in an effort to end the 2017–2021 Peruvian political crisis.

Both of the presidents were immediately impeached and removed from office by the dissolved Congress, thus being illegitimate.

On 7 December 2022 the President of Peru attempted to dissolve Congress but was impeached.

== Romania ==
According to the Romanian Constitution, voted in 1991 and revised in 2003, the President may dissolve the Parliament only if the Parliament rejects two consecutive prime minister candidates proposed by the President. Both houses can be dissolved. No dissolution of the Parliament has taken place in Romania since 1991.

== Russia ==
Under Articles 111 and 117 of the Russian Constitution, the president may dissolve the State Duma, the lower house of the Federal Assembly, if it either expresses no confidence in the Government of Russia twice in two months or rejects his proposed candidate for the prime minister three times in a row. At the same time, the president cannot dissolve the Federation Council, the upper house of the Federal Parliament. The power to dissolve the State Duma has not been exercised under the current constitution of 1993. Before the new constitution was enacted, President Boris Yeltsin had dissolved the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and Supreme Soviet of Russia during the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, although he did not have the formal constitutional powers to do so.

== Spain ==
In Spain, legislatures last four years, after which the king of Spain dissolves the Cortes Generales.
However, the prime minister, with previous deliberation on the Cabinet, can also dissolve the Cortes.
As an exception, if after two months of an unsuccessful president-investment, there is no president, the king dissolves the Cortes.

== Sri Lanka ==
According to the Constitution, the maximum legislative term of the Parliament of Sri Lanka is 5 years from the first meeting. The President of Sri Lanka may dissolve the Parliament. President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than 2 years and 6 months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament by resolution requests the President to dissolve Parliament.

== United Kingdom ==

=== Parliament of the United Kingdom ===

The King may at any time dissolve Parliament. By constitutional convention, this is only done on the advice of the Prime Minister. This prerogative power to dissolve Parliament was removed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but was revived by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022. A Parliament dissolves automatically five years after its first meeting unless dissolved earlier.

=== Northern Ireland Assembly ===

The Assembly can vote to dissolve itself early by a two-thirds majority of the total number of its members. It is also automatically dissolved if it is unable to elect a first minister and deputy first minister (effectively joint first ministers, the only distinction being in the titles) within six weeks of its first meeting or of those positions becoming vacant.

=== Scottish Parliament ===
Under section 2 of the Scotland Act 1998, as originally passed, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 etc.) The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the monarch on the proposal of the presiding officer. However, section 4 of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 postponed the general election that would have been held on 7 May 2015 to 5 May 2016 to avoid it coinciding with the UK general election fixed under that act. By the Scottish Elections (Dates) Act 2016, the following general election, scheduled for 7 May 2020, was postponed to 6 May 2021 for the same reason, although this became a moot point when a snap UK general election was held in June 2017 (a further UK general election was held in December 2019). Eventually, under the Scottish Elections (Reform) Act 2020, the &quot;normal&quot; term was extended to five years, which was &quot;de facto&quot; already the practice (2011, 2016, 2021 etc.).

Under section 3 of the Scotland Act 1998, if the parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the members voting in favour), or if the parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be first minister within certain time limits, the presiding officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the parliament is dissolved by the monarch by royal proclamation.

=== National Assembly for Wales ===
Under the Wales Act 2014, ordinary general elections to the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) are held the first Thursday in May every five years. This extension from a four- to five-year term was designed to prevent Senedd elections clashing with general elections to the Westminster Parliament subsequent to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.

== United States ==

In 1774 after the Boston Tea Party, the Massachusetts Bay Province&#x27;s legislature was dismissed under the Massachusetts Government Act and the colony was placed under martial law under the command of General Thomas Gage. In practice, the majority of the colony came under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the unrecognized Massachusetts Provincial Congress, and General Gage&#x27;s attempts to suppress widespread dissent among the colonists directly lead to the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the beginning of the Revolutionary War.

The United States Constitution does not allow for the dissolution of Congress, instead allowing for prorogation by the President of the United States when Congress is unable to agree on a time of adjournment. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 agreed on the need to limit presidential authority to prevent a return to autocracy. In &quot;Federalist No. 69&quot;, Alexander Hamilton stressed that unlike the King of Great Britain, the President does not have the authority to dismiss Congress at his preference. To date, the presidential authority to prorogue Congress has never been used, although in 2020 President Donald Trump threatened to use it in order to make recess appointments.

==Venezuela==
The Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela authorizes, through various articles, the president to dissolve the National Assembly.

Article 236 of the Constitution establishes which are the functions to be performed by the first national president; Paragraph 23 of this section states that one of the powers of the president is: &quot;Dissolve the National Assembly in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.&quot;

In statement 240 explains that will dissolve the Parliament when in a same constitutional period the Assembly approve the removal of the vice president of the country by means of censure, three times.

It is also clarified that the decree of dissolution of the Venezuelan congress entails the call for elections for a new legislature, which must be held in the next 60 days. In addition, this section indicates that the Parliament can not be dissolved during the last year of its constitutional period.

In the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice dissolved the National Assembly and assumed its legislative powers. The decision was viewed by the Venezuelan opposition and many members of the international community, including the United States, Mercosur, and the Organization of American States, as a self-coup by President Nicolás Maduro. After several days, the decision was reversed on the advice of President Maduro.

== In fiction ==

* In the 1977 science fiction film &quot;Star Wars&quot; the Emperor dissolves the Senate of the Galactic Empire, itself rendered a rubber stamp after his seizure of power in the former Galactic Republic, after the beginning of the Galactic Civil War and growing sympathy for the Rebel Alliance in the Senate. Each of the planets in the Empire are left under the control of regional governors, with fear of the newly created Death Star to prevent dissent and ensure the planets&#x27; continued allegiance to the Empire. 
* The 2014 play &quot;King Charles III&quot; and the 2017 television adaptation of the same name center around Prince Charles withholding royal assent to a parliamentary bill restricting freedom of the press after becoming King and then dissolving the British Parliament after it attempts to abolish the royal assent, leading to a constitutional crisis which forces Charles to abdicate in favor of his son Prince William.

Ropczyce has a total population of 26,055 according to the Polish Official Census 2008 of whom 15,098 live in the Ropczyce urban area and 10,957 live in the surrounding rural areas ( radius). It is the seat of Ropczyce-Sędziszów County, which has a total population of 713,350 people (30 June 2008).

==History==

The first reference to Ropczyce comes from a document of 1252, which confirmed the donation of the land by the brothers Klemens and Marek Gryf to a Cistercian Abbey in Szczyrzyc near Limanowa. Around this time Ropczyce was damaged by a Tatar raid. In 1266 the settlement was destroyed by an army composed of Ruthenians, Tatar and Lithuanian troops, led by the Ruthenian prince Shvarn. Ropczyce became a town on 3 March 1362, when the Polish king, Casimir III the Great, gave it town rights (Magdeburg rights). At the same time, he made two brothers, Jan and Mikolaj Gielnic the first &quot;wójts&quot; or advocates of the new town. He also made Ropczyce a parish, separate from the parish of Sędziszow. Within six years a parish church was built in the new royal town of Ropczyce. As Ropczyce was situated close to the Sandomierz Forest (), one of the biggest forests in southern Poland, which covers large parts of the Sandomierz Basin, it became a popular place for the Polish Kings to stay when they went hunting and fishing.
King Casimir III the Great, king Casimir IV Jagiellon and king Władysław II Jagiełło were regular visitors to Ropczyce. Under the patronage of the Polish Royals and subsequent trade agreements with Ruthenia, the town&#x27;s future started to look very good. It could then grow and develop, also due to its favourable location on an important trade route from Silesia and Lesser Poland to Ruthenia. Ropczyce was severely damaged during a Tatar raid in 1504. To help the town and citizens recover from this tragedy, king Alexander Jagiellon gave all the citizens a 10-year tax exemption from 1504 to 1514 In the 15th and 16th centuries Ropczyce became a major centre in the manufacture of canvas goods.

Since its formation Ropczyce has been known by several different names, although these appear to be phonetic variations of the same name. By the middle of the 16th century, it was first recorded as &#x27;Ropczyce&#x27; replacing the previous variation of &#x27;Robczyce&#x27; – this name is thought to have probably originated from the family name of Robek (from the Polish verb, &quot;robić&quot; – &quot;to work&quot;) who are thought to have established the original settlement.

In the 16th century Ropczyce&#x27;s churches were influenced by The Reformation, with the Parish Church going over to Protestantism several times. Around the 1550s the Parish Church was under the control of the Polish Brethren &quot;(Bracia Polscy, also called Arians or Socinians)&quot; for over a decade.

===17th century to 18th century===

Ropczyce&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot; was but a distant memory in the 17th and 18th centuries – these were times of wars and invasions. The town went into decline and life got a lot harder for the townspeople. In 1605 over half of the town was destroyed in a great fire. Fifty years later, Ropczyce was hit by The Plague. Ropczyce was plundered by Swedish troops in 1655 and then devastated in 1657 by the army of George II Rákóczi, the Prince of Transylvania. In 1669 the Parish Church was destroyed by fire.

On 14 July 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, Ropczyce found itself in the Austrian province of Galicia, part of the Habsburg monarchy in the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Ropczyce was first located in the administrative area (or &quot;cyrkuł&quot;) of Pilzno and in the Sandomierz district. In 1775 the administrative areas in Galicia were reorganised and Ropczyce was reallocated to the Tarnów &quot;cyrkuł&quot;. Fortunately for Ropczyce, as a &#x27;Royal town&#x27;, it was given virtually autonomous administration. The position of &#x27;town advocate’ was replaced by the new position of mayor. However, during these times the whole region was systematically Germanised, from the system of administration, local by-laws, education to everyday life.

===19th century to 20th century===

At the beginning of the 19th century, the population grew to over 1,000. At this time there was a small Austrian garrison stationed in the town. In 1806 there was a cholera outbreak in which 133 people from Ropczyce died. In 1873 the town was again struck by a great fire, with much destruction.
In the following administrative changes of the region of Galicia in 1885, 178 counties &quot;(powiats)&quot; were created in the existing 19 administrative areas (&quot;cyrkułs&quot;) and Ropczyce was made the administrative centre of its own |county. The last reorganisation occurred in 1867 saw the reduction of administrative areas and the number of counties set to 74. Ropczyce remained as the seat of its county. At the end of 1867 the population of Ropczyce county was 58,975 people, the first &quot;starosta&quot;; elder or mayor of the reorganised county of Ropczyce was Wilhelm Mehoffer (&quot;father of Józef Mehoffer, Polish painter&quot;). Ropczyce remained part of Galicia until 1918, when it became again part of independent Poland (Second Polish Republic).

According to the 1921 census, the town had a population of 3,002, of which 89.3% declared Polish nationality and 10.4% declared Jewish nationality.

===Jewish history===

The earliest information about Jews settling in Ropczyce dates back to 1564. It was noted then that four Jewish families, i.e. about 30 people, lived on the farm of the Gryf family. In 1604, King Sigismund III Vasa granted Ropczyce with a law, following which only two Jewish families (of a district’s leaseholder and of a tax collector) were allowed to live in the town, however, they were strictly forbidden to 

The 17th century was the time of the town’s stagnation and downfall. Ropczyce was plundered by Swedish troops in 1655 and conclusively devastated in 1657 by the army of George II Rákóczi, the Prince of Transylvania. Many houses in the town were deserted and ruined after the wars. As nobody paid for them, the local authorities tried to occupy the houses with new inhabitants. However, Polish townsmen were not interested in it, and so Jews were the buyers, despite the fact that the ban on their settling in the town was still in effect. The law was broken for the first time in 1675, when the Town Council allowed Józef Szmul, a Jew, to acquire a house at the Market Square under condition of renovating the building. In exchange for that, he was exempted from paying taxes for two years.

At the end of the 18th century, Ropczyce became a significant center of Chassidism after the famous Naftali Zvi Horowitz (1760–1827) settled in the town &quot;(He was born on 22 May 1760, the day that the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Chassidism, died)&quot;. He was the son of Menachem Mendel Rubin, the rabbi of Lesko and a follower of two great &quot;tzadikkim&quot;: Elimelech of Leżajsk (&quot;Lizhensk&quot;) and Menachem Mendel of Rymanów. &quot;Tzadik&quot; Naftali Zvi Horowitz was the author of, among others,&quot;Zera Kodesh&quot; (a collection of comments to the Torah, published in 1868), and &quot;Ohel Naftali&quot; (a collection of sayings, published in 1911). At the end of his life, he left Ropczyce and settled in Łańcut where he died on 8 May 1827 &quot;(corresponding to 11 Iyar 5587)&quot; and where he was buried. Asher of Ropczyce was the next &quot;tzadik&quot; of the town. The sons of Naftali Zvi Horowitz also became &quot;tzadikkim&quot;: Eliezer Horowitz – in Dzików near Tarnobrzeg, and Jakub Horowitz (named &quot;The Small&quot; &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot;, usually translated into English as , due to numerous miracles that he performed) – in Kolbuszowa and later in Mielec.

Up until World War II Ropczyce was a &quot;shtetl&quot; () with a significant Jewish population. There is a Ropshitz Hasidic dynasty.

The Germans occupied Ropczyce in September 1939 and immediately began brutalizing the Jewish population, at that time around 1000 people. They burned the synagogue and shortly began to conscript Jews for forced labor. Many Jewish refugees from nearby villages came to Ropczyce during the next two years. In May, 1942, 75 men were deported to a labor camp in Pustków. In June, there was another roundup where 23 people were murdered on the spot and others were sent to Pustków. Later in the month, the remaining Jews were forced into an overcrowded ghetto. In July, the Germans shot 28 people, children and the elderly, and took the rest of the Jewish population to Sędziszów Małopolski. Several hundred were shot there and the rest sent by train to Belzec where they were immediately gassed. The number of survivors among the Ropczyce Jews is unknown.

==Transport==
Ropczyce is located on the main West-East European E40 Highway, which goes from Calais in France via Belgium, across Germany, Poland, Ukraine and onto Russia and Kazakhstan. (Within Poland the E40 follows the A4 Highway and the DK 4 National Road). However, the A4 is not regarded as a &#x27;highway&#x27; in the Ropczyce area – it is by Western standards, just a regular, one-lane main A-road (although, it is currently being upgraded). Other Polish cities located by the E40 are Wrocław, Opole, Katowice, Kraków, Tarnów, Rzeszów and Przemyśl.

The nearest airport is Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport &quot;(Port Lotniczy Rzeszów-Jasionka)&quot; located in the village of Jasionka, north of Rzeszów. It is about east of Ropczyce on the E40 and takes about 40 minutes by car.
Scheduled passenger services include flights to: Warsaw (WAW), Dublin, London (Stansted), Bristol, UK, Birmingham, UK, New York (JFK Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport).

Ropczyce has a railway station which is on the main west–east rail route; . This runs from Silesia and Kraków, Kraków Main station &quot;(Kraków Główny)&quot; – Medyka on the Polish eastern border. This line then continues on to Ukraine.

<text>The Parliament of Ireland () was the legislature of the Lordship of Ireland, and later the Kingdom of Ireland, from 1297 until the end of 1800. It was modelled on the Parliament of England and from 1537 comprised two chambers: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Lords were members of the Irish peerage (&#x27;lords temporal&#x27;) and bishops (&#x27;lords spiritual&#x27;; after the Reformation, Church of Ireland bishops). The Commons was directly elected, albeit on a very restricted franchise. Parliaments met at various places in Leinster and Munster, but latterly always in Dublin: in Christ Church Cathedral (15th century), Dublin Castle (to 1649), Chichester House (1661–1727), the Blue Coat School (1729–31), and finally a purpose-built Parliament House on College Green.

The main purpose of parliament was to approve taxes that were then levied by and for the Dublin Castle administration. Those who would pay the bulk of taxation, namely the clergy, merchants, and landowners, also comprised the members. Only the &quot;English of Ireland&quot; were represented until the first Gaelic lords were summoned during the 16th-century Tudor reconquest. Under Poynings&#x27; Law of 1495, all Acts of Parliament had to be pre-approved by the Irish Privy Council and English Privy Council. Parliament supported the Irish Reformation and Catholics were excluded from membership and voting in penal times. The Constitution of 1782 amended Poynings&#x27; Law to allow the Irish Parliament to initiate legislation. Catholics were re-enfranchised under the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793.

The Acts of Union 1800 merged the Kingdom of Ireland and Kingdom of Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The parliament was merged with that of Great Britain; the united Parliament was in effect the British parliament at Westminster enlarged with a subset of the Irish Lords and Commons.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
After the 12th-century Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland, administration of the Anglo-Norman Lordship of Ireland was modelled on that of the Kingdom of England. Magna Carta was extended in 1217 in the Charter of Ireland. As in England, parliament evolved out of the Magnum Concilium &quot;great council&quot; summoned by the king&#x27;s viceroy, attended by the council (curia regis), magnates (feudal lords), and prelates (bishops and abbots). Membership was based on fealty to the king, and the preservation of the king&#x27;s peace, and so the fluctuating number of autonomous Irish Gaelic kings were outside of the system; they had their own local brehon law taxation arrangements. The earliest known parliament met at Kilkea Castle near Castledermot, County Kildare on 18 June 1264, with only prelates and magnates attending. Elected representatives are first attested in 1297 and continually from the later 14th century. In 1297, counties were first represented by elected knights of the shire (sheriffs had previously represented them). In 1299, towns were represented. From the 14th century a distinction from the English parliament was that deliberations on church funding were held in Parliament rather than in Convocation. The separation of the individually summoned lords from the elected commons had developed by the 15th century. The clerical proctors elected by the lower clergy of each diocese formed a separate house or estate in until 1537, when they were expelled for their opposition to the Irish Reformation.

The 14th and 15th centuries saw shrinking numbers of those loyal to the crown, the growing power of landed families, and the increasing inability to carry out judicial rulings, that all reduced the crown&#x27;s presence in Ireland. Alongside this reduced control grew a &quot;Gaelic resurgence&quot; that was political as well as cultural. In turn this resulted in considerable numbers of the Hiberno-Norman Old English nobility joining the independent Gaelic nobles in asserting their feudal independence. Eventually the crown&#x27;s power shrank to a small fortified enclave around Dublin known as the Pale. The Parliament thereafter became essentially the forum for the Pale community until the 16th century.

Unable to implement and exercise the authority of the Parliament or the Crown&#x27;s rule outside of this environ, and increasingly under the attack of raids by the Gaelic Irish and independent Hiberno-Norman nobles, the Palesmen themselves encouraged the Kings of England to take a more direct role in the affairs of Ireland. Geographic distance, the lack of attention by the Crown because of the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Wars of the Roses, and the larger power of the Gaelic clans, all reduced the effectiveness of the Irish Parliament. Thus, increasingly worried that the Irish Parliament was essentially being overawed by powerful landed families in Ireland like the Earl of Kildare into passing laws that pursued the agendas of the different dynastic factions in the country, in 1494, the Parliament encouraged the passing of Poynings&#x27; Law which subordinated Irish Parliament to the English one.

===Kingdom of Ireland===

The role of the Parliament changed after 1541, when Henry VIII declared the Kingdom of Ireland and embarked on the Tudor conquest of Ireland. Despite an era which featured royal concentration of power and decreasing feudal power throughout the rest of Europe, King Henry VIII over-ruled earlier court rulings putting families and lands under attainder and recognised the privileges of the Gaelic nobles, thereby expanding the crown&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; authority. In return for recognising the crown&#x27;s authority under the new Kingdom of Ireland, the Gaelic-Anglo-Irish lords had their position legalised and were entitled to attend the Irish Parliament as equals under the policy of surrender and regrant.

The Reformation in Ireland introduced in stages by the Tudor monarchs did not take hold in most of the country, and did not affect the operation of parliament until after the papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot; of 1570. Initially in 1537, the Irish Parliament approved both the Act of Supremacy, acknowledging Henry VIII as head of the Church and the dissolution of the monasteries. In the parliaments of 1569 and 1585, the Old English Catholic representatives in the Irish Commons had several disputes with the crown&#x27;s authorities over the introduction of penal legislation against Catholics and over-paying of &quot;Cess&quot; tax for the putting down of various Gaelic and Catholic rebellions.

For this reason, and the political fallout after the 1605 Gunpowder plot and the Plantation of Ulster in 1613–15, the constituencies for the Irish House of Commons were changed to give Protestants a majority. The Plantation of Ulster allowed English and Scottish Protestant candidates in as representatives of the newly formed boroughs in planted areas. Initially this gave Protestants a majority of 132–100 in the House of Commons. However, after vehement Catholic protests, including a brawl in the chamber on Parliament&#x27;s first sitting, some of the new Parliamentary constituencies were eliminated, giving Protestants a slight majority (108-102) of members of the House of Commons thereafter.

In the House of Lords the Catholic majority continued until the 1689 &quot;Patriot Parliament&quot;, with the exception of the Commonwealth period (1649–60). Following the general uprising of the Catholic Irish in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the self-established Catholic assembly in 1642–49, Roman Catholics were barred from voting or attending the Parliament altogether in the Cromwellian Act of Settlement 1652, which was reversed by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660.

===1660 to 1800===


Following the death of Cromwell and the end of the Protectorate, the Stuarts returned to the throne thereby ending the sectarian divisions relating to parliament. Then, during the reign of James II of England, who had converted to Roman Catholicism, Irish Catholics briefly recovered their pre-eminent position as the crown now favoured their community. When James was overthrown in England, he turned to his Catholic supporters in the Irish Parliament for support. In return for its support during the Williamite war in Ireland (1688–91), a Catholic majority &quot;Patriot Parliament&quot; of 1689 persuaded James to pass legislation granting it autonomy to and to restore lands confiscated from Catholics in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The Jacobite defeat in this war meant that under William III of England Protestants were returned to a favoured position in Irish society while substantial numbers of Catholic nobles and leaders could no longer sit in parliament unless they took a loyalty oath as agreed under the Treaty of Limerick. Having proven their support for Catholic absolutism by their loyal support for James during the war, and because the Papacy supported the Jacobites after 1693, Irish Catholics increasingly faced discriminatory legislation in the Penal Laws that were passed by the predominantly loyalist and Protestant Parliament from 1695.

Nonetheless, the franchise was still available to wealthier Catholics. Until 1728, Catholics voted in House of Commons elections and held seats in the Lords. For no particular reason, beyond a general pressure for Catholics to conform, they were barred from voting in the election for the first parliament in the reign of George II. Privileges were also mostly limited to supporters of the Church of Ireland. Protestants who did not recognise the state-supported Church were also discriminated against in law, so non-conformists such as Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Quakers also had a subservient status in Parliament; after 1707 they could hold seats, but not public offices. Thus, the new system favoured a new Anglican establishment in Church and State.

By 1728, the remaining nobility was either firmly Protestant or loyally Catholic. The upper classes had dropped most of its Gaelic traditions and adopted the Anglo-French aristocratic values then dominant throughout most of Europe. Much of the old feudal domains of the earlier Hiberno-Norman and Gaelic-Irish magnates had been broken up and given to Irish loyalists soldiers, and English and Scottish Protestant colonial settlers. Long under the control of &quot;de jure&quot; power of magnates, the far larger peasant population had nonetheless under the relatively anarchic and sectarian conditions established a relative independence. Now, the nobility and newly established loyalist gentry could exercise their rights and privileges with more vigour. Much as in England, Wales, and Scotland, the franchise was always limited to the property owning classes, which favoured the landed gentry.

The Irish Parliament was thus at a time of English commercial expansion left incapable of protecting Irish economic and trade interests from being subordinated to English ones. This in turn severely weakened the economic potential of the whole of Ireland and placed the new and largely Protestant middle-class at a disadvantage. The result was a slow but continual exodus of Anglo-Irish, Scots-Irish, and Protestant Irish families and communities to the colonies, principally in North America. Ironically, it was the very efforts to establish Anglicans as the primacy in Ireland which slowly subverted the general cause of the Protestant Irish which had been the objective of successive Irish and British Parliaments.

The Irish Parliament did assert its independence from London several times however. In the early 18th century it successfully lobbied for itself to be summoned every two years, as opposed to at the start of each new reign only, and shortly thereafter it declared itself to be in session permanently, mirroring developments in the English Parliament. As the effects on the prosperity of the Kingdom of submitting the Irish Parliament to review by the British became apparent, the Irish Parliament slowly asserted itself, and from the 1770s the Irish Patriot Party began agitating for greater powers relative to the British Parliament. Additionally, later ministries moved to change the Navigation Acts that had limited Irish merchants&#x27; terms of trade with Britain and its empire.

==Powers==
After 1707, Ireland was, to varying degrees, subordinate to the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Parliament of Ireland had control over only legislation, while the executive branch of government, under the Lord Lieutenant, answered to the British government in London. Furthermore, the Penal Laws meant that Catholics, who constituted the majority of Irish people, were not permitted to sit in, or participate in elections to, the parliament. Meanwhile, building upon the precedent of Poynings&#x27; Law which required approval from the British Privy Council for bills to be put to the Irish Parliament, the Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719 declared the British Parliament&#x27;s right to legislate for Ireland and the British House of Lords appellate jurisdiction over its courts.

The effects of this subordination of Irish Parliamentary power soon became evident, as Ireland slowly stagnated economically and the Protestant population shrank in relative size. Additionally, the growing relative wealth of the American colonies, whose local authorities were relatively independent of the British Parliament, provided additional ammunition for those who wished to increase Irish Parliamentary power. When the British governments started centralising trade, taxation and judicial review throughout the Empire, the Irish Parliament saw an ally in the American colonies, who were growing increasingly resistant to the British government&#x27;s objectives. When open rebellion broke out in the American colonies in 1775, the Irish Parliament passed several initiatives which showed support for the American grievances.

Fearing another split by Ireland, as rebellion spread through the American colonies and various European powers joined in a global assault on British interests, the British Parliament became more acquiescent to Irish demands. In 1782, following agitation by major parliamentary figures, most notably Henry Grattan, supported by the Patriot movement, the Irish parliament&#x27;s authority was greatly increased. Under what became known as the Constitution of 1782 the restrictions imposed by Poyning&#x27;s Law were removed by the Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782. Grattan also wanted Catholic involvement in Irish politics; the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793 passed by the Irish parliament copied the British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, and Catholics were given back the right to cast votes in elections to the parliament, although they were still debarred from membership and state offices.

==Organisation==

The House of Lords was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sat on the woolsack, a large seat stuffed with wool from each of the three lands of England, Ireland and Scotland. In the Commons, business was presided over by the Speaker who, in the absence of a government chosen from and answerable to the Commons, was the dominant political figure in the parliament. Speaker Conolly remains today one of the most widely known figures produced by the Irish parliament.

Much of the public ceremonial in the Irish parliament mirrored that of the British Parliament. Sessions were formally opened by the Speech from the Throne by the Lord Lieutenant, who, it was written &quot;used to sit surrounded by more splendour than His Majesty on the throne of England&quot;. The Lord Lieutenant, when he sat on the throne, sat beneath a canopy of crimson velvet. At the state opening, MPs were summoned to the House of Lords from the House of Commons chamber by Black Rod, a royal official who would &quot;command the members on behalf of His Excellency to attend him in the chamber of peers&quot;. 

Sessions of Parliament drew many of the wealthiest of Ireland&#x27;s Anglo-Irish elite to Dublin, particularly as sessions often coincided with the social season, (January to 17 March) when the Lord Lieutenant presided in state over state balls and drawing rooms in the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle. Leading peers in particular flocked to Dublin, where they lived in enormous and richly decorated mansions initially on the northside of Dublin, later in new Georgian residences around Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square. Their presence in Dublin, along with large numbers of servants, provided a regular boost to the city economy.

The Parliament&#x27;s records were published from the 1750s and provide a huge wealth of commentary and statistics on the reality of running Ireland at the time. In particular, minute details on Ireland&#x27;s increasing overseas trade and reports from various specialist committees are recorded. By the 1780s they were published by two rival businesses, King &amp; Bradley and Grierson.

==The Act of Union and abolition==
From 31 December 1800, the Parliament of Ireland was abolished entirely, when the Acts of Union 1800 created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and merged the British and Irish legislatures into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom after 1 January 1801.

The idea of a political union between Ireland and Great Britain had been proposed several times throughout the 18th century, but was vehemently opposed in Ireland. The granting of legislative independence to Ireland in 1782 was thought to have ended hopes of a union. Relations between the two parliaments became strained in 1789 during the illness of King George III, when the Irish parliament invited the Prince of Wales to become the Regent of Ireland, before Westminster had been able to make its own decision on the matter. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 saw a French expedition landing in Killala, causing alarm that Ireland could be used as a base for attacks on Britain, resurrecting the idea of political union between Ireland and Great Britain. The British Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger had the strong support of King George III for a union, with the king advising him on 13 July 1798 that the rebellion should be used &quot;for frightening the supporters of the Castle into a Union&quot;. The Protestant Ascendancy was also seen as being unequal in the task of governing Ireland, and that such a &quot;corrupt, dangerous and inefficient system&quot; had to be done away with.

In June 1798, Lord Cornwallis was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, with one of his main tasks to be securing support in Ireland for a union. Cornwallis would report that &quot;The mass of the people of Ireland do not care one farthing about the Union&quot;.

For the idea to succeed, Pitt knew that he needed large scale public support in Ireland for the idea from both Protestants and Catholics, and as such Catholic Emancipation would need to be delivered along with the union. Catholic Emancipation alone he knew would be enough to secure the stability of Ireland. The Catholic middle classes and the Catholic hierarchy, led by John Thomas Troy, the Archbishop of Dublin, were willing to support the union if Catholic Emancipation did indeed follow. Only a group of Catholic barristers, most notably Daniel O&#x27;Connell, opposed the idea of union.

For Protestants, the Presbyterians, who were largely involved in the rebellion of 1798 would shed no tears over the end of the Irish parliament. The Orange Order tried to be neutral on the issue of union, however thirty-six lodges from counties Armagh and Louth alone petitioned against the Union. The fear for some Protestants, especially those part of the Protestant Ascendancy, was that Catholic emancipation would immediately follow any union. The artisans and merchants of Dublin also feared any union as it might have resulted in a loss of business.

When William Pitt&#x27;s idea of union and emancipation was revealed to the cabinet of the Irish parliament, the Speaker and Chancellor of the Exchequer both vehemently opposed it. The rest of the cabinet supported the idea however were split on the issue of Catholic Emancipation, resulting in it being dropped from the proposals. Cornwallis observed: &quot;I certainly wish that England could now make a union with the Irish nation, instead of making it with a party in Ireland&quot;.

Any union between Ireland and Great Britain would have to be in the form of a treaty in all but name, meaning that any act of union would need to be passed separately in both the Dublin and Westminster parliaments. There was strong support for it in Westminster, however Dublin was not as keen.

An amendment was moved on 22 January 1799, seeking the House to maintain &quot;the undoubted birthright of the people of Ireland to have a free and independent legislature&quot;. The debate which followed consisted of eighty speeches, made over the course of twenty-one uninterrupted hours. The next day a vote was held which resulted in a defeat of the amendment by one vote (106 to 105), however the following day another motion against any union passed 111 to 106.

Following these votes, Lord Castlereagh and Lord Cornwallis set about trying to win over as many Irish MPs as possible through bribery consisting of jobs, pensions, peerages, promotions, along with other enticements. These methods were all legal and not unusual for the time. They also spent over £1,250,000 buying the support of those who held the seats of boroughs and counties.

When parliament reopened on 15 January 1800, high levels of passion ran throughout, and angry speeches were delivered by proponents on both sides. Henry Grattan, who had helped secure the Irish parliament&#x27;s legislative independence in 1782, bought Wicklow borough at midnight for £1,200, and after dressing in his old Volunteer uniform, arrived at the House of Commons of the Irish parliament at 7 a.m., after which he gave a two-hour speech against the union. Regardless, a motion against the union failed by 138 votes to 96, and resolutions in favour of the union were passed with large majorities in both chambers of parliament.

The terms of the union were agreed on 28 March 1800 by both houses of the Irish Parliament. Two Acts with identical aims (but with different wording) were passed in both the British and Irish parliaments, with the British Act of Union becoming law on 2 July 1800, and royal assent given to the Irish Act of Union on 1 August 1800. The Irish Parliament met for the last time the following day. On 1 January 1801, the provisions of the Acts of Union came into force.

<text>The (officially stylized as Pokémon mini) is a handheld game console that was designed and manufactured by Nintendo in conjunction with The Pokémon Company and themed around the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. It is the smallest game system with interchangeable cartridges ever produced by Nintendo, weighing just under . It was first released in North America on November 16, 2001, and was only available for purchase at the Pokémon Center and via its website. This was followed by releases in Japan on December 14, 2001, and in Europe on March 15, 2002. The system was released in three colors: Wooper Blue, Chikorita Green, and Smoochum Purple.

Features of the Pokémon mini include an internal real-time clock, an infrared port used to facilitate multiplayer gaming, a reed switch for detecting shakes, and a motor used to implement force feedback. Only ten games were released, five of which were exclusive to Japan, with only being four games released in North America, one fewer than in Europe.

Various hackers have reverse engineered the Pokémon mini in order to enable the creation of homebrew games, and to allow official games to be played on other platforms.

== List of games ==
A total of 10 games were officially released for the Pokémon Mini. While all titles were released in Japan, only four were released in North America and five in Europe, all being launch titles. This was due to the low sales and interest in the system. The Japanese-exclusive titles would eventually receive fan translations.

The games were published in Japan by The Pokémon Company and elsewhere by Nintendo.

===Pokémon Party mini===
 is a minigame collection developed by Denyusha. It includes six minigames which all take advantage of the system&#x27;s capabilities and abilities:
* Hitmonchan&#x27;s Boxing: As a Hitmonchan battling against a Machop in a boxing match, the player must shake the system to &#x27;punch&#x27;.
* Pikachu&#x27;s Rocket Start: As a Pikachu, the player must launch off a starting line before another Pokémon (A Rattata, Eevee and another Pikachu). Pikachu can run using the buttons or shaking the system. An Elekid gives the signals which is achieved through the system&#x27;s rumble ability.
* Bellossom&#x27;s Dance: A rhythm game. As a Bellossom playing against two other Bellossom, the player must match the right moves with the D-Pad, and shake the system to jump.
* Chansey&#x27;s Dribble: A simple soccer dribbling game. As a Chansey, the player must use the D-pad to position the ball, and make sure Chansey kicks it into the finish line as quickly as possible.
* Slowking&#x27;s Judge: As a Slowking, the player predicts if a tennis ball will land in or out of the court.
* Sneasel&#x27;s Fakeout: A rock paper scissors-like game for two players. As two Sneasel, the players decide who is on defense and offense in a game of Basketball.

Additional modes include &quot;Battlefield&quot;, where two to six players battle for the highest score in the aforementioned minigames, and &quot;Celebi&#x27;s Clock&quot;, a clock with date, alarm and stopwatch function.

===Pokémon Pinball mini===

 is a pinball game developed by Jupiter. The player uses Pokémon such as a Diglett or a Pikachu as the &#x27;bumping&#x27; mechanism. Along the way, players can catch more Pokémon for use, and other Pokémon can function as level obstacle elements. There are 70 &quot;Quest&quot; levels, and 10 levels each in Time Attack and Score Attack modes.

===Pokémon Puzzle Collection===
 is a puzzle minigame collection developed by Jupiter. It features four different game types, which can unlock over 80 Pokémon in the game&#x27;s &quot;Minidex&quot;.
* Motion Puzzle: A sliding game where a moving image of a Pokémon has to be unscrambled by the player.
* Shadow Puzzle: The player must find different shapes and put them together to make an image of a Pokémon.
* Rescue Mission: A Pokémon is trapped, and the player must remove the blocks so they can access the rest of the maze.
* Power On: A &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;-like game where one has to connect a Pikachu to a light bulb, creating a circuit.

===Pokémon Zany Cards===
 is a card game compilation developed by Denyusha. It includes four playing card games featuring Pokémon-themed cards and characters from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime.
* Wild Match: The player battles against other characters from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime by making the most evolutionary matches, which at turn gives out coins, with the player who has the most coins winning.
* Special Seven: The player battling with other &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime characters must get rid of their hand of cards, which can be determined by suit or matching Pokémon.
* Card Duel: A two-player only game where the players must attempt to get each other&#x27;s deck with the highest valued card.
* Four Kings: A single-player Solitaire-type game where cards must be stacked into a specific order, while Magikarp (which functions as the &quot;King&quot;) must top the deck off.

===Pokémon Tetris===
 is a Puzzle game developed by Nintendo. It plays like most versions of &quot;Tetris&quot;, but in addition to traditional piece rotation, shaking the system will cause falling pieces to flip horizontally. All of the Pokémon from &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; can be &quot;caught&quot; and added to the in-game Pokédex, although rarer Pokémon can only be found on higher difficulty levels.

The game was not released in North America, but was rated by the ESRB under the title Pokémon Mini Shock Tetris, suggesting it was planned for release.

===Pokémon Puzzle Collection vol. 2===
 is a puzzle minigame collection developed by Jupiter, and is the sequel to &quot;Pokémon Puzzle Collection&quot;. In addition to the returning &quot;Motion Puzzle&quot; and &quot;Shadow Puzzle&quot; modes, two new modes have been added:
* Pick-Up Puzzle: The player clears Poké Balls on the field in a forward-only position, and can only move if Poké Balls are faced in the respective direction.
* Stretch Puzzle: The player, through a given number, must fill gaps in a grid by stretching bars.

The game was not released in Europe or North America, but was rated by the ESRB under the title Pokémon Mini Puzzle Collection Vol. 2, suggesting it was planned for release.

===Pokémon Race mini===
 is a platform racing game developed by Jupiter. Similar to the later-released &quot;Pokémon Dash&quot;, the player controls a Pikachu and races against other Pokémon including a Chikorita, Wooper, Pichu, and Sandshrew in a competition for the fastest Pokémon.

===Pichu Bros. mini===
 is a minigame compilation developed by Denyusha, and is the sequel to &quot;Pokémon Party mini&quot;. It features six new minigames based on the Pichu Bros. specials:
* Skate Pichu: An Endless runner game where as one of the Pichu Bros., the player must avoid obstacles by shaking the system.
* Magby&#x27;s Hot-Air Balloon: As Magby, the player must land a hot-air balloon on an island without falling into the sea.
* Hoppip&#x27;s Jump: The player must press the C button at the right time to make Hoppip jump.
* Teddiursa&#x27;s Shaking Fruits: By shaking the system, the player must make Teddiursa eat a piece of fruit in the shortest amount of time.
* Smoochum&#x27;s Angel Kiss: A Whack-A-Mole-type game where the player, as Smoochum, must attempt to kiss the Diglett that pop out of the holes by pressing the buttons at the right time.
* Cubone&#x27;s Bone Club Fight: As Cubone, the player must shake the system to throw the bone and make sure it hits the target.

The &quot;Battlefield&quot; and &quot;Clock&quot; modes also return from the original.

===Togepi&#x27;s Great Adventure===
 is a top-down action puzzle game developed by Jupiter. The player guides Togepi out of maze-like levels in a tower while avoiding obstacles and other Pokémon. The game features over 200 levels spread across three towers.

===Pokémon Breeder mini===
 is a virtual pet game developed by Jupiter. The player is given an egg that hatches into a Treecko, Torchic or Mudkip. The player must keep the Pokémon happy by feeding it, playing with it, and using toys. Feeding the Pokémon with special Pokéblocks can improve its stats.

==Legacy==
The 2002 GameCube game &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; has an in-game Pokémon Mini that can be unlocked. By purchasing new games from the in-game store, the player can play emulated demo versions of multiple Pokémon Mini games. One of these games, &quot;Snorlax&#x27;s Lunch Time&quot;, was never part of any commercial Pokémon Mini release.

By reverse engineering the &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; emulator, hobbyist software engineers were able to gain a better understanding of how the system worked. This allowed them to build new emulators to run the games on other devices, such as the PC, Dreamcast, Nintendo 3DS, and Analogue Pocket, among others. These efforts also led multiple programmers to create homebrew applications for the system, such as original games and tech demos. A demo, &quot;SHizZLE&quot;, was released at Breakpoint in 2005 and caused some excitement within the demoscene and media. In 2022, independent developer Sungrand Studios launched a Kickstarter campaign to develop a port of their horror game &quot;Silver Falls&quot; for the system.

<doc id="652306" wikidata="Q922782" url="?curid=652306" title="White-billed crow">
<text>The white-billed crow (Corvus woodfordi) is a member of the crow family found on the Solomon Islands.

== Description ==
It is a short and stocky forest bird (40–41 cm in length) with a short, squared-off tail and a relatively large head with a very distinctive deep and curved pale ivory-coloured bill with a darker tip. The dark nasal bristles, though not thick, are quite apparent against the pale coloured bill. The bird overall is very glossy black with a greenish-purple gloss to the head and purple gloss to the rest of the body. The iris is pale grey or white in the adult bird and the legs and feet are black.

The voice is described as being reminiscent of the Torresian crow but higher in pitch and faster, giving an &quot;ao-ao-ao&quot; sound.

This species is confined to the central part of the Solomon Islands and can be found specifically on the islands of Choiseul, Isabel and Guadalcanal where it forages in small family groups through the trees, feeding on various insects and fruits. It is normally difficult to view as it often remains well hidden in the high forest canopy while feeding and even flying low, just over the tops of the trees when moving on.

As is the case with many forest crows, there is little information on the species&#x27; breeding habits.

<doc id="652307" wikidata="Q5443294" url="?curid=652307" title="Fender Zone Bass">
<text>The Fender Zone is a fretted electric bass guitar, introduced in 2001.

It has a slightly lighter and smaller body than previous Fender basses. The 2004 models were made of solid Mahogany and Walnut or Alder and Maple timbers and have a pair of Zone humbucking pickups powered by an 18V active 3-band preamp. Part of the best-selling Fender American Deluxe Series, the Zone Bass replaced the Japanese P-Bass Lyte Deluxe (which featured a mahogany body, an active humbucking Jazz Bass pickup in the bridge position and a single 9V powered 3-band active EQ preamp), which was gone a year earlier.

The Mexican made Fender Zone bass is essentially the same design as the Fender Precision Bass Lyte, which was manufactured in Japan, except for the addition of a set of custom-wound hum-cancelling P/J pickups and a three-band active EQ powered by a single 9V battery. The J-style bridge unit is a customized version of a pre-2004 Deluxe Active Jazz Bass pickup. On the five-string Zone, it&#x27;s a Vintage Noiseless Jazz Bass pickup with solid covers. The Zone replaced the P-Bass Lyte after its discontinuation in late 2000. A five-string version of the Mexican Zone Bass was launched in 2005. Both the American and Mexican Zone basses were discontinued from the Fender pricelist at the end of 2006.

<doc id="652308" wikidata="Q2633001" url="?curid=652308" title="Ridley (Metroid)">
<text>, also known in-universe by the alias Cunning God of Death, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series. An evil and aggressive draconic extraterrestrial, he became Samus Aran&#x27;s archnemesis after murdering the latter&#x27;s parents as he led a Space Pirate raid on her homeworld. Though having been destroyed numerous times by Samus, he is repeatedly resurrected through various means.

Originally appearing as a subordinate of Mother Brain (another primary antagonist), he returns in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; in his cybernetic Meta Ridley form, commanding the Space Pirates himself. Ridley is killed in-universe during the events of &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, though a clone of him introduced in &quot;&quot; persists after his death. Ridley has been met with a largely positive response since his debut, and has garnered a large fan-base regarding his presence in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; crossover fighting game franchise.

==Appearances==

Ridley&#x27;s debut is in the Nintendo Entertainment System video game &quot;Metroid&quot;. He and Kraid are Space Pirate figureheads charged with protecting Mother Brain at a base on the planet Zebes, where they are cloning an alien species known as Metroids with the intention of converting them into biological weapons. Samus Aran kills him and the rest of the Space Pirates. Ridley later appeared in the &quot;Metroid&quot; manga, where he is revealed to have caused the death of Samus&#x27;s parents in an attack on her home world when she was a child. Ridley is highly intelligent despite his appearance, and has a unique ability to recover from seemingly lethal attacks. In &quot;Metroid&quot;″s remake, &quot;&quot;, a mechanical doppelganger known as Mecha Ridley confronts Samus in a unique post-game mission exclusive to &quot;Zero Mission&quot;, acting as the game&#x27;s final boss opponent.

Ridley appeared in the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, where he attacks a space station containing the last surviving Metroid, fleeing with it to Zebes. Samus gives chase and kills Ridley. This is his final appearance in &quot;Metroid&quot;″s in-universe chronology, and believed to be his final death. Ridley later appears in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, which takes place following the events of &quot;Metroid&quot;. Ridley is referred to as Meta Ridley in-game, and sports mechanical enhancements. Ridley is encountered again in the game &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot;, where he battles Samus once again under the name Omega Ridley. Ridley appears again in the game &quot;&quot;, where he appears as the game&#x27;s final boss in the form of Proteus Ridley.

A clone of Ridley is created during the 2010 game &quot;&quot;. The clone takes the form of a creature known as Little Birdie, which quickly evolves into a fully grown Ridley. The Ridley clone is later killed, and its corpse is collected and re-encountered in-universe in the 2002 game &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, where it is replicated by the game&#x27;s main antagonists, the X Parasites. The clone is destroyed following this appearance.

Ridley appears in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; crossover fighting game series in many of its installments. He appears in a cameo in &quot;Melee&quot;, and acts as a boss opponent in &quot;Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;. He later appears as a playable character in &quot;Ultimate&quot;. Ridley additionally makes guest appearances in other video games such as &quot;Dead or Alive: Dimensions&quot;.

==Development==
Ridley is believed to be named after Ridley Scott, director of the 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;, which has been described by character designer Yoshio Sakamoto as a &quot;huge influence&quot; on the world of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series.

Mike Sneath, one of three senior character artists for &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, was responsible for designing the Meta Ridley version of Ridley seen in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. It took him about &quot;20 to 25 days&quot; to model and texture Meta Ridley, citing the wings as having taken a few days of his time, commenting that it took him a while to get the shaders to work to give his wings the appearance of having &quot;holographic energy&quot;. He was not involved with designing the battle with Meta Ridley, which was left up to the game designers. Andrew Jones, the lead concept artist for &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, had little to do with the design of Ridley. The initial design submitted was rejected by Nintendo, while the second design the artists submitted was approved. Steve Barcia, the executive producer of Retro Studios, called Ridley his favorite enemy from &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; due to the quality of the battle and his fan appeal. He added that such a battle was rare for a first-person shooter, which helped to set &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; apart. 

The director of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, Masahiro Sakurai, stated in an interview with &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; that the development team considered including Ridley as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; but decided against the idea due to creative difficulties. In an interview with &quot;IGN&quot; about Ridley&#x27;s exclusion from &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, Sakurai argued that reducing Ridley&#x27;s size, wingspan or mobility to include him as a fighter would not be true to the character, who is supposed to be a &quot;truly threatening presence&quot; that could only be correctly portrayed as a stage boss unencumbered by a fighter&#x27;s size and balance restrictions. Sakurai said that high demand from players inspired him to add several playable characters to &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, including Ridley.

==Reception==
Throughout the history of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series, Ridley has received positive reception as a series antagonist by multiple sources, including &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Jesse Schedeen called Ridley the real villain of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series, commenting that he would have to be included in a &quot;Metroid&quot; film if one were made due to him being too important to leave out. Author Daryl Baxter in the book &quot;50 Years of Boss Fights&quot; found Ridley&#x27;s boss fight in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; to be emblematic of the series&#x27; shift to 3D, believing it showcased the effective transition of iconic elements of the series to a new medium. &quot;TheGamer&quot; writer Eric Switzer found Ridley to be a good polar opposite to Samus, believing him to be representative of what would happen if Samus were to let go of her moral constraints, but disliked Ridley&#x27;s role in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, feeling he did not have a strong presence in the game&#x27;s plot which made his final battle with Samus feel unearned.

Ridley has been a popular character suggestion in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series from fans, with demand for his inclusion dating back to &quot;Melee&quot;. In a 2008 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, Masahiro Sakurai stated his reluctance to include Ridley in the series for a variety of reasons. This resulted in a vocal fanbase for the character, which took the form of both ironic internet memes and genuine support for his inclusion. &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Nathan Grayson believed the appeal of Ridley lay in Ridley&#x27;s status as a &quot;legacied&quot; Nintendo character, as well as how the &quot;Metroid&quot; franchise lacked significant representation on the roster of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. His initial lack of inclusion also resulted in widespread negative response on the Internet, especially when it was revealed that he was not playable in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;. Many fans were also upset due to his lack of inclusion while other characters with high similarities to pre-existing characters on the roster (such as &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; character Dark Pit) were included. &quot;Polygon&quot; writer Ryan Gilliam discussed Ridley&#x27;s long-standing popularity with the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; fanbase, which he believed to have started in the form of rumors in the early 2000s. He found Ridley to be a popular character with fans due to his history not only in &quot;Metroid&quot;″s fanbase, but also in &quot;Smash&quot;&#x27;s fanbase due to the long-lasting desire for Ridley to be included in the series. Due to Sakurai&#x27;s reluctance to include Ridley in the series, an internet meme was created about Ridley being &quot;too big&quot; for &quot;Smash&quot;, which became a popular joke within the fandom.

<text>Robert James Adley (2 March 1935 – 13 May 1993) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom and a railway enthusiast.

==Early life and family==
Robert James Adley born on 2 March 1935, the son of Harry Adley, a company director. He was educated at Falconbury School and Uppingham School, before becoming the Director of Sales at the May Fair Hotel (1960–64). In 1961, he married Jane Elizabeth Pople, daughter of Wilfred Pople of Somerset. Later, he was the Marketing Director at Holiday Inns of Canada.

Adley was born Jewish but converted to Anglicanism, and was married with two children.

==Political career==
He was a councillor on Slough Borough Council from 1965 and first stood for Parliament in 1966 for Birkenhead, failing to win the strongly Labour seat. He became Member of Parliament for Bristol North East after winning the seat by 462 votes in the 1970 election. However, significant boundary changes before the next election in 1974 saw Adley move on to become member of parliament for the new seat of Christchurch and Lymington. In the 1970s Adley was part-time Marketing Director for Holiday Inn (UK). He would brief his agency (Alexander James &amp; Dexter) in the morning, before going to the House of Commons. He would safely hold this seat from 1974 to 1983, and then after further boundary changes the Christchurch seat from 1983 until his death with one of the largest Conservative majorities in the country.

Adley was well known as a railway enthusiast, after gaining a love of trains when he was given &quot;The Wonder Book of Trains&quot; at the age of three. Adley became leader of the Conservative backbench committee on transport and then the Chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee. He became a leading opponent of the plans being made by John Major&#x27;s government for the privatisation of British Rail, describing it a &quot;poll tax on wheels&quot;. Adley had previously opposed the poll tax and bus deregulation, while supporting Concorde and an integrated transport system. Adley also called for talks with the African National Congress and for the UK government to support the aspirations of the black majority in apartheid-era South Africa.

== Death ==
Adley died in the Royal Brompton Hospital following a heart attack in 1993 at the age of 58. After his death the seat was won in a by-election by Liberal Democrat Diana Maddock, but was regained by the Conservatives in 1997. British Rail named locomotive 91022 &quot;Robert Adley&quot; in November 1993.

==Author==
Adley was the author of numerous books mainly on the subject of railways and in particular steam engines.

<doc id="652313" wikidata="Q900765" url="?curid=652313" title="Fumihiro Joyu">
<text>is a former spokesperson and public relations manager of the Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo, and served as the &quot;de facto&quot; chief of the organization from 1999 to 2007, when he split and formed a new group.

==Background==

Fumihiro Joyu, originally from Kurume, Fukuoka in Kyūshū, graduated from Waseda University, one of Japan&#x27;s most prestigious private colleges, with an M.A. degree in artificial intelligence.

==Spokesman for Aum Shinrikyo==

Summoned to Japan after the arrests of senior followers following the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, he resumed his position as Aum Shinrikyo&#x27;s spokesperson. He was arrested and tried for &quot;inciting others to make false statements during [1992] court hearings&quot;. Some observers linked Joyu&#x27;s indictment to a supposed government attempt to &quot;decapitate the cult&quot;. The arrest, lengthy trial, and subsequent acquittal of Japan&#x27;s veteran attorney and Human Rights activist Yoshihiro Yasuda, then head of Shoko Asahara&#x27;s legal team, a move which was harshly criticized by Human Rights Watch, is often cited in support of this hypothesis.

Joyu would often argue with reporters during press conferences. Especially after the sarin attack, he was sometimes referred to by Japanese as &quot;Aa ieba Joyu&quot;, which is a pun on the expression &quot;Aaieba koiu&quot;, meaning someone who is excessively contrarian and argumentative (literally &quot;you say one thing and he says the opposite&quot;).

He was sentenced to three years in prison and was released in 1999. Later, Joyu apologized for denying Aum&#x27;s responsibility for the subway attack, saying at that time he had believed that in defending Aum he did the right thing.

==Aleph (1999–2006)==

On his release on 29 December 1999, Joyu became the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the organisation. Under his leadership, Aum Shinrikyo has changed its name to Aleph, the first letter of the Carthaginian alphabet. The group has admitted responsibility for the various incidents involving some of its former senior members, including the Tokyo Subway gas attack, delivered apologies to the victims, and established a special compensations fund. Some of the controversial doctrines that previously attracted criticisms were removed. Most of the time, Joyu resided within Aum&#x27;s religious facilities with occasional trips to the outside world. Police officials were quoted as advising him to refrain from public activities as they &#x27;could not guarantee his safety&#x27;.

Joyu&#x27;s attempts to soften tensions with society did not win him much praise, though. Judging from the statements made by the country&#x27;s government officials and unanimously critical media coverage, Aleph is still regarded as a threat.

==The Circle of Rainbow Light (2007–present)==

Leadership split into two opposing factions by the end of 2005, according to the Japanese media quoting the Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA), which has been monitoring Aleph since 1999. While the fundamentalist faction wishes to keep the organization as close to its pre-1995 ideal, Joyu and his reformer supporters advocate a milder course, aimed at softening social tensions and re-integration into society.

Opposing factions split in late summer 2006, with Joyu and his supporters (among them many former Aum leaders) residing in a separate building in Tokyo and calling themselves Hikari no Wa (The Circle of Rainbow Light). According to Joyu, many of the members have not taken sides yet, and keep staying with the opposing group. It was raided by PSIA agents on 10 May 2007.

<text>Richard Thain Alexander (29 June 1934 – 20 April 2008) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Newark in Nottinghamshire until losing his seat in the landslide of the 1997 general election.

==Early life==
Alexander was born in Aberdeen, although his father was an architect from Lincoln. He went to Logie Coldstone prep school in Eastbourne and Dewsbury Grammar School and the Wheelwright School in Dewsbury, Yorkshire before studying law at University College London and then at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. He was articled in London, and then worked as a solicitor in Scunthorpe from 1960 to 1964 and then in Retford, Nottinghamshire from 1964 to 1985.

==Political career==
Having joined the Young Conservatives in 1957, Alexander served on their National Advisory Committee in 1961 and fought his first elections in 1962 and 1963, standing (unsuccessfully) for Scunthorpe Town Council. He was elected to Retford Borough Council in 1965 and to Nottinghamshire County Council in 1967, serving until 1974. He was elected to Bassetlaw District Council in 1975, and he was Mayor of Retford in 1977–78.

He was a parliamentary candidate for Lincoln in 1966 and again in 1970, but he was not chosen by the right-wing local party to fight the by-election of 1973. The seat was won by the sitting MP, Dick Taverne, each time.

At the 1979 general election, Alexander narrowly and unexpectedly beat the popular Labour MP for Newark, Edward Stanley Bishop despite the remaining presence of working mines in the constituency.

He adopted a maverick approach in the House of Commons, and was never made a Minister. He was fully in support of the Conservatives on defence issues, describing Tony Benn&#x27;s approach to the Falklands War as a &quot;&quot;prima facie&quot; case of treason and sedition&quot; and strongly opposing the &quot;no first use&quot; pledge on nuclear weapons. On other issues he was more moderate, being a member of the Tory Campaign for Homosexual Equality for a time (he resigned over a controversial article which suggested that Prince Charles should embrace Prince Edward in order to advance their campaign). Alexander could also appear a classic Tory. He faithfully supported Margaret Thatcher, bridled at the poor dress sense of the Labour MP Terry Fields (a member of the Militant group), supported rate capping of left-wing councils, and sought the abolition of Wages Councils which set minimum pay rates.

His majority was substantially increased at the 1983 general election, after boundary changes removing the mining area to the neighbouring Sherwood constituency (although that too went Conservative in 1983). He also supported the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in the 1984 UK miners&#x27; strike, but criticised the 31 pit closures announced by Michael Heseltine in October 1992. He was one of many Conservative MPs to lose their seats in the Labour landslide at the 1997 general election. The victor, Fiona Jones, was convicted of falsifying her election expenses in March 1999, and Alexander was to stand at the resulting by-election, but the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 1999 with no need for a by-election.

After his time in Parliament, Alexander was subsequently elected to serve as a councillor for the Magnus ward of Newark and Sherwood District Council.

==Personal life==
He married Valerie Ann Winn in 1966. They had a son and a daughter. He separated from his first wife in 1979 and they were divorced in 1985. He remarried in 1987, to Pat Hanson.

Alexander died aged 73 at Beaumond House Community Hospice, Newark-on-Trent, after a short battle with cancer.

<text>A privy council is a body that advises a head of state, typically, but not always, in the context of a monarchical government. The term &quot;privy&quot; (from French &quot;privé&quot;) signifies private or secret. Consequently, a privy council, more common in the past, existed as a group of a ruling monarch&#x27;s most trusted court advisors. Its purpose was to consistently provide confidential advice on matters of state. Despite the abolition of monarchy, some privy councils remained operational, while others were individually disbanded, allowing the monarchical system to continue to exist without a secret crown council.

<text>The Vis (Polish designation &quot;pistolet wz. 35 Vis&quot;; German designation &quot;9 mm Pistole 35(p)&quot;, or simply the Radom in some English sources and Vis wz. 35 in Poland) is a Polish 9×19mm caliber, single-action, semi-automatic pistol.

Production of the Vis began in 1935 at the Fabryka Broni factory in Radom, and was adopted as the standard handgun of the Polish Army the following year. After the Polish Campaign of 1939 that marked the start of World War II, occupying German forces took over the country&#x27;s munitions and industry; the pistol was valued by the Germans, who continued its production and eventually issued it to German paratroopers.

The Vis is highly prized among collectors of firearms and considered by some to be one of the best firearms of the period, combining some of the features present in the Colt M1911, the Browning Hi-Power, and the Ruby .45 ACP.

==History==

===Design===
The pistol bears many internal and external similarities to the famous Colt M1911A1, which was the main inspiration behind the project – to the point that some consider the Vis to be an iteration of the Colt M1911. The Vis was designed by Piotr Wilniewczyc, and in 1930 at the Fabryka Broni (Arms Factory) in Radom under Director Kazimierz Ołdakowski. The first prototype version was ready in 1930 and patented in 1932, when 134 prototype handguns of the &quot;Vis wz. 32&quot; were produced.

The pistol operates on the short-recoil principle, with the barrel being cammed down and away from the locking lugs in the slide. Unlike the M1911, the Vis was not cammed by a link, but by a ledge of sorts, which contacts a portion of the barrel and forces it down as it is moved rearward with the slide by the recoil force. It shares some similarities to the Spanish Ruby .45 ACP. A characteristic feature was a trapezoid grip shape, wider at the bottom, offering good ergonomics and firm grip. On the right side grip cover, the Polish pistols had the letters &quot;VIS&quot; in a triangle, on the left side—FB (for &quot;Fabryka Broni&quot;—&quot;Arms Factory&quot;). Initially it was named &quot;WiS&quot; (an acronym of the Polish designers&#x27; names), later the name was changed to Vis, meaning &quot;force&quot; in Latin, with the &quot;wz.&quot; abbreviation for &quot;wzór&quot; (&quot;model&quot;).

The tests proved that the handgun was very accurate and stable (due to its size and mass, most stresses are absorbed and not passed on the shooter), while at the same time remaining reliable after firing more than 6,000 rounds. The Vis was generally regarded as one of the best military pistols of that period.

===Military use===
Mass production started in the state armoury Fabryka Broni in Radom in late 1935, and the following year it was introduced as the standard firearm of Polish infantry and cavalry officers. Successively, other units were to be equipped, and by 1942 all other handguns were scheduled to be withdrawn from service. By mid-1938, it was introduced to the armoured and air forces. Before the invasion of Poland, approximately 49,400 (out of 90,000 ordered) were delivered to the army.

In addition to the 9mm, there was also a small information series of .45 ACP version, with 7-round magazine, but they were not produced in greater series. Most probably only for the Argentinian competition the wooden stock-shoulder was issued but it has not survived. A .22 LR variant also existed, but no details are known, and its series was not produced in great numbers.
After the Polish defeat in 1939, the Germans took over the Radom Armoury and continued production of the Vis under the new name of &quot;9 mm Pistole 645(p)&quot;, which was for some reason often rendered as &quot;P 35(p)&quot; (the suffix &quot;p&quot; means &quot;polnisch&quot;) (the German pistols of the first series had inscriptions VIS Mod.35 and P.35(p) on the left side). Up to 1945, between 312,000 and 380,000 were produced and used by the German paratroopers and military police.

Polish technicians working in the armoury stole many handgun parts to be assembled clandestinely and supplied for use by the Home Army in their fight against the German occupation; when the Nazis discovered this, some of the Polish workers were hanged publicly in front of the factory while others were sent to concentration camps. The Germans moved production of barrels and final assembly to Steyr-Daimler-Puch in the &quot;Ostmark&quot; (Austria). However, underground production of Vis barrels was started in Warsaw and Kielce-based Huta Ludwików, and several hundred Vis pistols were assembled using parts smuggled from the factory, delivered to the Home Army, and used extensively during the Warsaw Uprising, among other battles.

Vis pistols made by the Germans after 1939 were issued in four different series, each with small modifications to simplify production. In late 1944, all production was moved to the Steyr works in Austria, where the last simplified model of the fourth series was produced (with no inscriptions at all, apart from &quot;bnz&quot; signature). The Vis remained in production until April 1945. Generally, the wartime Vis were of much lower quality than the original Polish versions, and further declined towards the end of the war.

===Post-war developments===
After the war, production of the pistol was not continued, as the Army of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland used the Soviet TT-33 pistol, produced in the former &quot;Fabryka Broni&quot; in Radom due to Warsaw Pact regulations. It was considered much inferior to the Vis, especially in ergonomics and reliability, but political considerations and Soviet influence were decisive.

In August 1997, the Łucznik Arms Factory in Radom reintroduced the Vis pistol and produced a small series of some 27 pistols on the basis of the original plans and specifications, mainly for the US collectors&#x27; market. But it differed from the original pre-war pistols with the shape of the rear sight notch and the Eagle on the slide. In 2010 another short series was manufactured. In 2012 IWA Radom Factory has presented the piece dated 2010 that was chromium coated instead of blued. On the 90th anniversary of the arms factory, 50 more handguns were produced for collectors in 2015.

In December 2017, FB Radom&#x27;s chairman, Adam Suliga, confirmed to the Polish magazine &quot;MILMAG&quot; that the Vis would be returning to production, and is planned to be available for retail in the second half of 2018. This will not be a single commemorative series, but rather, according to &quot;MILMAG&quot;, FB Radom reportedly hope to continually offer the wz.35 for the export market.

==Overview==
The Vis pistol is a single-action, hammer-fired, locked-breech design. The control on the slide is a decocking mechanism that releases the hammer while camming the firing pin up into the slide. There is a grip safety blocking the sear unless fully compressed, but the control in the same position as a thumb safety on a Browning Hi-Power or M1911-style pistol is not a safety.

The take-down lever is used to lock the slide back (as the Browning Hi-Power safety is used) during disassembly to allow removal of the slide release lever. In later variants, this lever is omitted and the slide must be manually aligned to remove the slide release lever. Once the slide and frame are aligned (by the disassembly lever or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release the slide release lever and allow it to drop free. The slide will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.

The magazine catch is to the rear of the trigger guard and not at the heel of the grip in the typical European fashion of the time. A pistol lanyard is installed in the heel position for pistol retention. There is no magazine safety.

<text>Rupert William Simon Allason (born 8 November 1951) is a British former Conservative Party politician and author. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Torbay in Devon, from 1987 to 1997. He writes books and articles on the subject of espionage under the pen name Nigel West.

==Background==
Born in London, Allason and his brother, Julian, were brought up as Roman Catholics, the faith of their Irish mother, Nuala (who acted under the names Nuala McElveen and Nuala Barrie), daughter of John A. McArevey, of Foxrock, Dublin. The boys attended Downside School. Their father, James Allason, was also a Conservative Party MP, descended from the architect Thomas Allason.

==Political career==
Allason contested Kettering in 1979 and Battersea in 1983 before being elected as Conservative MP for Torbay in 1987.

He was opposed to integration with the European Union; in 1993 he was the only Conservative to refuse to vote for the Maastricht Treaty when it was made into a motion of confidence. The vote was narrowly won, but Allason&#x27;s abstention caused him to have the party whip withdrawn for a year.

He left parliament after the landslide 1997 general election in which he lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Adrian Sanders. His margin of defeat was just twelve votes, one of the narrowest election margins since 1945. It was reported that Allason had failed to tip a pub waitress a week before polling day, and that as a consequence, fourteen waiters who were going to vote for him switched to the Liberal Democrats.

In 2000, Allason was reported to have considered joining the UK Independence Party (UKIP). Author Jon Ronson, in the first chapter of his book &quot;&quot;, briefly analysed Allason&#x27;s career and character, with particular emphasis on his 1997 electoral loss.

==Literary career==
As an author, Allason has concentrated on security and intelligence issues. He was voted &#x27;The Experts&#x27; Expert&#x27; by a panel of other spy writers in &quot;The Observer&quot; in November 1989. In 1984 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; commented: &quot;His information is so precise that many people believe he is the unofficial historian of the secret services. West&#x27;s sources are undoubtedly excellent. His books are peppered with deliberate clues to potential front-page stories.&quot;

Allason has been a frequent speaker at intelligence seminars and has lectured at both the KGB headquarters in Dzerzhinsky Square, Moscow; and at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, where he once addressed an audience that included the Soviet spy Aldrich Ames. He continues to lecture to members of the intelligence community at the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies in Washington, D.C.

His special contribution to the study of modern historical espionage has been in tracking down former agents and persuading them to tell their stories. He traced the wartime double agent GARBO, who was reported to have died in Africa in 1949. However, Allason found him in Venezuela, and they collaborated on the book &quot;Operation Garbo&quot;, published in 1985.

He was also the first person to identify and interview the mistress of Admiral Canaris, the German intelligence chief who headed the Abwehr, and he was responsible for the exposure of Leo Long and Edward Scott as Soviet spies.

His titles include &quot;The Crown Jewels&quot;, based on files made available to him by the KGB archives in Moscow; &quot;VENONA&quot;, which disclosed the existence of a GRU spy-ring operating in London throughout the war, allegedly headed by J. B. S. Haldane and Ivor Montagu; and &quot;The Third Secret&quot;, an account of the CIA&#x27;s intervention in Afghanistan. &quot;Mortal Crimes&quot;, published in September 2004, investigates the scale of Soviet espionage in the Manhattan Project, the Anglo-American development of an atomic bomb.

In 2005 he edited &quot;The Guy Liddell Diaries&quot;, a daily journal of the wartime work of MI5&#x27;s Director of Counter-Espionage. He also published a study of the Comintern&#x27;s secret wireless traffic, &quot;MASK: MI5&#x27;s Penetration of the Communist Party of Great Britain&quot;, and the first of a series of counter-intelligence textbooks, &quot;The Historical Dictionary of British Intelligence&quot;, &quot;The Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence&quot; and &quot;The Historical Dictionary of Cold War Counter-Intelligence&quot;.

In his 2018 book, &quot;Cold War Spymaster: A Legacy of Guy Liddell, Deputy Director of MI5&quot;, the author did not suggest that Liddell had passed secrets to the Soviets, as had been claimed by some other authors, including John Costello in his &quot;Mask of Treachery&quot;. In fact, Allason under the &#x27;West&#x27; pseudonym stated that Liddell &quot;was betrayed by Burgess, Blunt and Philby&quot;, according to a 2019 summary of the book.

==Legal actions==
Allason has been involved in a number of legal cases, in each of which he represented himself without lawyers. While in the House of Commons, he campaigned against the use of public-interest immunity certificates, and exposed the arms-dealing activities of the publisher and fraudster Robert Maxwell. He was sued for libel by Maxwell but won the case, winning record damages for a litigant in person by counterclaim.

In 1996 Allason sued Alastair Campbell for malicious falsehood with regard to an article printed in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in November 1992. The case was heard by Mr Justice Drake, without a jury. The judge ruled that Allason had failed to demonstrate that the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; article, although inaccurate, had caused him any financial loss. In a retrial in 1998, he was awarded £1,050 in damages and 75% of his legal costs.

In 1998, Allason lost a libel action – his 18th – against the authors and publishers of the &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; 1997 diary for referring to him as &quot;a conniving little shit&quot;.

In 2001, Allason sued Random House, the publishers of &quot;The Enigma Spy&quot;, the autobiography of the former Soviet agent John Cairncross. Allason claimed he had ghostwritten &quot;The Enigma Spy&quot; in return for the copyright and 50 per cent of the proceeds. However, Allason lost the case and was ordered to pay costs of around £200,000. The trial judge, Mr Justice Laddie, described him as &quot;one of the most dishonest witnesses I have ever seen&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
Allason is the recipient of the US Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO)&#x27;s Lifetime Literature Achievement Award, and in 2011 he was elected to the Honorary Board of that association. He is the European Editor of the &quot;World Intelligence Review&quot;, published in Washington, D.C.

== Personal life ==
In 1979 Allason married Nikki van Moppes. They divorced in 1996. The couple have two children. In 2012, he married violinist Nicola Loud.

<doc id="652327" wikidata="Q838011" url="?curid=652327" title="C character classification">
<text>C character classification is a group of operations in the C standard library that test a character for membership in a particular class of characters; such as alphabetic, control, etc. Both single-byte, and wide characters are supported.

== History ==
Early C programmers working on the Unix operating system developed programming idioms for classifying characters. For example, the following code evaluates as &quot;true&quot; for an ASCII letter character codice_1:
(&#x27;A&#x27; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#x27;Z&#x27;) || (&#x27;a&#x27; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#x27;z&#x27;)
Eventually, the interface to common character classification functionality was codified in the C standard library file &quot;ctype.h&quot;.

== Implementation ==
For performance, the standard character classification functions are usually implemented as macros instead of functions. But, due to limitations of macro evaluation, they are generally not implemented today as they were in early versions of Linux like:
#define isdigit(c) ((c) &gt;= &#x27;0&#x27; &amp;&amp; (c) &lt;= &#x27;9&#x27;)
This can lead to an error when the macro parameter codice_2 is expanded to an expression with a side effect; for example: codice_3. If the implementation was a function, then x would be incremented only once. But for this macro definition it is incremented twice.

To eliminate this problem, a common implementation is for the macro to use table lookup. For example, the standard library provides an array of 256 integers one for each character value that each contain a bit-field for each supported classification. A macro references an integer by character value index and accesses the associated bit-field. For example, if the low bit indicates whether the character is a digit, then the codice_4 macro could be written as:
#define isdigit(c) (TABLE[c] &amp; 1)
The macro argument, codice_1, is referenced only once, so is evaluated only once.

== Overview of functions ==
The functions that operate on single-byte characters are defined in &quot;ctype.h&quot; header file (&quot;cctype&quot; in C++). 
The functions that operate on wide characters are defined in &quot;wctype.h&quot; header file (&quot;cwctype&quot; in C++).

The classification is evaluated according to the effective locale.

<doc id="652336" wikidata="Q6120396" url="?curid=652336" title="Jacques Arnold">
<text>Jacques Arnold DL (born 27 August 1947) is a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gravesham in Kent from 1987, when he succeeded Tim Brinton, until he lost his seat in the landslide 1997 election. He is now a consultant and lecturer on Latin American Affairs as well as the author of a two-book series on political and genealogical subjects. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent in January 2013.

Unlike many of his fellow former Tory MPs, he refought the seat at the 2001 election – only to come second place to Labour&#x27;s Chris Pond. The Tories regained the seat in 2005 with Adam Holloway becoming the MP, the first time since the 1951 general election that the seat had not been held by the winning party.

==Biography==
Jacques Arnold was educated at schools in Brazil, before returning to England in 1968, to attend the London School of Economics (LSE), where he attained a BSc (Hons.) in Economics. During that period he was Chairman of LSE Conservatives, the student society of the Tories at the London School of Economics.

==Career==

<text>Sir Thomas Richard Arnold (25 January 1947 – 14 November 2023) was a British Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hazel Grove from 1974 to 1997.

== Biography ==
Thomas Richard Arnold was born in London on 25 January 1947, to his parents Thomas Charles Arnold, a theatrical producer and Helen Arnold. Young Tom Arnold attended the Bedales School, the Institut Le Rosey, and Pembroke College, Oxford.

Arnold died on 14 November 2023, at the age of 76.

== Political career ==
After unsuccessfully contesting the safe Labour seat of Manchester Cheetham in 1970, Arnold was elected to the British House of Commons for Hazel Grove in October 1974, defeating the Liberal incumbent Michael Winstanley; he had fought the same seat unsuccessfully in the previous General Election that same year. He served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Hazel Grove until his retirement in 1997. From 1979 to 1982, Arnold was the Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Northern Ireland Office and later in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1983, Arnold was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party under Chairmen Cecil Parkinson and John Gummer.

When Arnold began office, in 1974, he was one of the youngest members of Parliament, along with Anthony Nelson and Malcolm Rifkind, later joined in 1977 by both Andrew MacKay and Tim Smith. During the 1970s, the five were referred to as &quot;The Tories&#x27; Young Men&quot;, with Arnold being the only backbencher in the group. Arnold was an ardent supporter of the European Economic Community during his time in Parliament, although he later became much more sceptical.

Arnold was knighted in the 1990 Birthday Honours for political service.

<doc id="652345" wikidata="Q2452341" url="?curid=652345" title="Triangle piercing">
<text>A triangle piercing is one of several forms of genital piercing applied to the vulva. It is a horizontal piercing that passes from side to side, beneath the base of the clitoral hood tissue where it meets the inner labia and under the clitoris. The name is derived from the tissue where the labia meets the clitoral hood, which looks like a triangle when pinched.

The piercing can increase sexual sensation during direct clitoral stimulation as well as during vaginal or anal penetration. It can stimulate the clitoris from behind, the only genital piercing to do so, although it does not pass through the clitoris or the clitoral shaft. The usual jewellery worn with the piercing is a barbell. There are reports of the piercing alleviating anorgasmia in some individuals.

It is one of the more complicated and expensive genital piercings. The average healing time is 12 to 18 weeks and the triangle piercing is more likely to experience subsequent bleeding than other types of vulva piercings. There are a number of anatomical requirements with regards to the vulva. For instance, the clitoral hood has to protrude outwards from the body for sufficient distance. Most vulvas are not suited to the piercing. Its complexity results from the fact that the piercer has to use mainly tactile rather than visual cues for its placement. It is in a location where mistakes could result in the piercing being misplaced or lead to pain and damage to the vulva. Some people find it to be one of the more painful genital piercings because it passes through so much tissue and so many nerves.

== History ==
According to PFIQ magazine, the first triangle piercing was performed by Lou Duff of the Gauntlet body piercing studio in the early 1990s. It was subsequently developed by Elayne Angel.

<doc id="652349" wikidata="Q3503281" url="?curid=652349" title="Pssst">
<text>Pssst is an action video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game that was released for the ZX Spectrum in June 1983. In the game, Robbie the Robot has to protect his plant (a &quot;Thyrgodian Megga Chrisanthodil&quot;) as it is attacked by various insects, each of which needs a different repellent to neutralise it. &quot;Pssst&quot; was the second game to be released by Ultimate, after &quot;Jetpac&quot;.

The game was written by Chris Stamper and graphics were designed by his brother, Tim Stamper. &quot;Pssst&quot; was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing &quot;instantaneous&quot; loading of the game (the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes). The game received positive reviews from two publications upon release, with critics mainly praising its presentation and gameplay. 

==Gameplay==
The game is presented from a single, 2D perspective, and revolves around Robbie the Robot&#x27;s objective to defend his plant from interstellar space slugs, leeches and midges. The plant grows from the bottom centre of the screen, and spray cans containing three different pesticides are located on ledges on each side of the screen. Bonus items such as fertiliser and fly swatters appear on unoccupied ledges which will increase both the players score and the plant&#x27;s growth rate.

There are three types of coloured parasite, and three types of pesticide, which will either kill, stun, or have no effect on the parasites. The player can only carry one type of pesticide at a time; during the early stages of the game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than one type of parasite on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.

As the plant grows it may sprout leaves; these increase the growth rate but also vulnerability to the parasites. Once the plant reaches a predetermined height it flowers and the player advances to the next level. A life will be deducted whenever the plant dies or the player makes contact with a parasite.

==Development==
&quot;Pssst &quot; is one of the few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing instantaneous loading of the game when the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes. The game used the common technique of sprites and allowing them to be placed atop each other, which often overlapped colours on the screen causing attribute clash. &quot;Pssst&quot; was also able to run on the 16K version of the Spectrum.

==Reception==
Paul Liptrot of &quot;Home Computing Weekly&quot; praised the graphics, stating them as overall &quot;smooth-moving&quot; and colourful, as well as praising the &quot;addictive&quot; gameplay. &quot;ZX Computing&quot; considered the game as very professionally written and produced, with excellently smooth and detailed graphics. In addition, the review stated originality, addictivity and enjoyability of &quot;Pssst&quot;.

&quot;Pssst&quot; reached number 10 in the MRIB Top 30 software charts in July 1983 while &quot;Jetpac&quot; was still at number 1. In the fourth issue of &quot;Personal Computer Games&quot;, &quot;Pssst&quot; was nominated for a 1983 game of the year list on account of Ultimate&#x27;s &quot;famous graphics&quot;. According to the reviewer, other attributes of the game included its &quot;originality&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; in comparison to other Ultimate titles that were released in 1983. In a retrospective review, a reviewer of &quot;Retro Games! Now&quot; summarised that the game &quot;was not the best&quot; of Ultimate&#x27;s releases for the ZX Spectrum, despite considering it to be &quot;less lauded&quot; than the others. However, they considered &quot;Pssst&quot; to be a &quot;taste of things to come&quot; and a significant improvement over the &quot;clunky&quot; and &quot;jumpy&quot; animation of previous games for the ZX Spectrum.

<text>The Coral are an English rock band, formed in 1996 in Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, Merseyside. The band emerged during the early 2000s. Their 2002 debut album &quot;The Coral&quot;, from which came the single &quot;Dreaming of You&quot;, was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and listed as the fourth best album of the year by &quot;NME&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Magic and Medicine&quot; (2003), produced four UK Top 20 singles, including &quot;Pass It On&quot;. In 2008, after guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones left the band, they continued as a five-piece.

==History==

===1996–2000: early years and breakthrough===
In 1996, school-friends Ian Skelly and Paul Duffy began jamming together in the basement of Flat Foot Sams pub in Hoylake. Over the following months they were joined by Bill Ryder-Jones on lead guitar, Ian&#x27;s older brother James Skelly on vocals and main songwriting duties, and then Lee Southall on rhythm guitar. The band were known briefly as Hive before choosing the name &quot;The Coral&quot;, and the line-up was completed with the addition of Nick Power, who joined as keyboard player in 1998. All six original members were attending Hilbre High School when the band formed. Power attended Calday Grange Grammar

According to Deltasonic head Alan Wills, he first encountered the band from a gig poster they had made of their &#x27;granddads head exploding&#x27;, and decided to go and see them live. At that point the band had not released any records. When Wills discovered the band he had already started to think about starting a label but had yet to do so, and the Coral gave Wills the impetus to start Deltasonic. Wills told HitQuarters that: &quot;It was always the aim to release them through Deltasonic, and it was always their aim to be on Deltasonic ... Most people wouldn&#x27;t have understood the Coral at that point&quot;. Wills also assumed responsibility for managing the band, albeit reluctantly as he was unable to find anyone else to take on the role.

===2001–2004: &quot;The Coral&quot; and &quot;Magic and Medicine&quot;===
Hailed as the first English band of the &quot;guitar group revival&quot;, the band&#x27;s first release was the single &quot;Shadows Fall&quot; (2001), which was followed by two EPs &quot;The Oldest Path EP&quot; (2001) and &quot;Skeleton Key EP&quot; (2002). Their eponymous debut album &quot;The Coral&quot;, released in 2002, reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and was nominated for the Mercury Prize the day after its release. A successful UK tour and festival slots followed along with the singles &quot;Goodbye&quot; reaching number twenty-one in the UK Singles Chart and &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; reaching number thirteen. The single &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; was included in the United States sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode My Monster for broadcasting and DVD, but eventually taken out again for streaming. The Coral also performed &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; live on Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien.

After a hectic year they recorded &quot;Magic and Medicine&quot; in 2003, which reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and garnered critical praise. The album was largely made up of dreamlike acoustic ballads rather than the aggressive psychedelia of their debut. They followed the release with UK, European, American and Japanese tours and a one-off festival Midsummer Nights Scream, held in a big top on the New Brighton promenade. The support for this event included a line up of up-and-coming bands, such as The Libertines, The Zutons and The Thrills. Singles from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think You&#x27;re the First&quot;, &quot;Pass It On&quot;, &quot;Secret Kiss&quot; and &quot;Bill McCai&quot; reached number 10, 5, 25, and 23 respectively on the UK Singles Chart.

Next, the Coral quickly recorded the mini-album &quot;Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker&quot;. Released in early 2004 with little promotion and no accompanying singles, it was also included as a bonus disc with US versions of &quot;Magic and Medicine&quot;. &quot;Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker&quot; marked another change in direction for the band, showcasing a darker, funkier and more lo-fi sound.

===2005–2009: &quot;The Invisible Invasion&quot; and &quot;Roots &amp; Echoes&quot;===
In 2004 they began recording &quot;The Invisible Invasion&quot;, with Portishead&#x27;s Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrow as producers. On its 2005 release, The Invisible Invasion entered the UK Album Chart at number 3. A second CD containing live versions of songs from this and previous albums was included with early copies. The Coral followed this with UK, European, American and Japanese tours, also releasing &quot;In the Morning&quot; which reached number six and &quot;Something Inside of Me&quot; which reached number forty-one on the UK Singles Chart.

In June 2005 guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones took a break from the band and it was announced that he would not tour again, but might continue to help with future recordings. He was replaced by David McDonnell (later of The Sand Band) for The Invisible Invasion tour. In late 2005 the band had written an album without Bill entitled &quot;The Curse of Love&quot;, at the beginning of 2006, however, Ryder-Jones was persuaded to rejoin as a full-time band member and the band shelved those songs in order to begin work on another album, &quot;Roots &amp; Echoes&quot;.

The Coral toured with Arctic Monkeys during their 2007 summer festival gigs, releasing the single &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Find Me&quot; on 30 July 2007 followed by the album &quot;Roots &amp; Echoes&quot; on 6 August 2007. The band enlisted the help of Matt Potter for percussion and jazz flute on the album. In contrast to their frenetic early material, this album was a much more laid-back affair, and displayed a new-found maturity to the band&#x27;s songwriting. Tracks such as &quot;Rebecca You&quot; and &quot;Music at Night&quot; were embellished with string arrangements written by Ryder-Jones. They opened the BBC Electric Proms on 24 October 2007 with &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Find Me&quot; and were joined on stage by celebrity friend Noel Gallagher, who played lead guitar on their track &quot;In the Rain&quot;.

In January 2008 Ryder-Jones left the Coral, apparently due to experiencing panic attacks before playing live, and finding that his desire to be part of a commercially successful band had disappeared. He has since received great acclaim with an orchestral solo album. In a March 2010 interview, Bill Ryder-Jones said of James Skelly&#x27;s songwriting: &quot;James was such a brilliant songwriter, still is&quot;.

===2010–2011: &quot;Butterfly House&quot;===
Drawing a line under the first chapter of their career, the Coral released a three-LP and two-CD compilation album &quot;Singles Collection&quot; on 15 September 2008, featuring all but two of their singles to date. A new single, &quot;Being Somebody Else&quot; was released on 8 September 2008. The album also contained a second CD entitled &quot;Mysteries &amp; Rarities&quot; which contained 19 previously unreleased songs, demos, outtakes and live recordings of earlier songs.

The Coral released their sixth album &quot;Butterfly House&quot; on 12 July 2010. The album was produced by John Leckie, of The Stone Roses and Radiohead fame, and was recorded at RAK studios in London as well as Rockfield in South Wales.

Four singles were released from the album, &quot;1000 Years&quot;, &quot;More than a Lover&quot;, &quot;Walking in the Winter&quot; and &quot;Two Faces&quot;. The new songs had been crafted over a two-year span during which the band fine-honed and road-tested the material. The deluxe version of this album came with a bonus CD of five additional songs. Critical reception was largely positive. Record Collector Magazine was notably praiseworthy: &quot;Butterfly House… continues to set the benchmark high. A thing of true wonderment, it&#x27;s shimmering, beatific multi-coloured coats of guitars and vocal harmonies – think The Everly Brothers, Byrds, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash – dress songs that primarily concern themselves with the demystification process… this is a genuine contender for 2010 album of the year&quot;.

Six months after the release of &quot;Butterfly House&quot;, the Coral released &quot;Butterfly House Acoustic&quot;, a limited edition acoustic re-recording of the entire album which they completed in a single day, after positive reviews of their acoustic live performances.

In February 2011, Butterfly House was named UK Album of the Year 2010 at the Music Producers Guild Awards. Robert Plant a fellow MPG nominee for his album with The Band of Joy, carefully scheduled his rehearsal on BBC2&#x27;s Later With Jools in order to make it to the Coral&#x27;s performance at the Royal Albert Hall on 15 November 2010.

===2012–2017: &quot;The Curse of Love&quot; and &quot;Distance Inbetween&quot; ===
In a March 2012 interview, bassist Paul Duffy reported that a new album was in progress at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios in Bristol, stating that the sound was a lot heavier: &quot;It&#x27;s very layered, it&#x27;s like you have one thing and you just keep adding things on top, and it just sounds big cause we&#x27;ve gone in as a six piece&quot;. In spring 2012 the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order to concentrate on individual projects. Their half-finished seventh album was shelved.

On 24 August 2014, Geoff Barrow announced when standing in for Stuart Maconie on the BBC Radio 6 Music Freak Zone show that the Coral were to release &quot;The Curse of Love&quot; in September 2014. The album was recorded around the time of &quot;The Invisible Invasion&quot;, an album produced by the Portishead and Beak man, but was only recently mastered for release on James Skelly&#x27;s Skeleton Key label. &quot;Wrapped in Blue&quot; is the first cut from the album, which Barrow played on the show.

On 23 November 2015, the band announced their 2016 return after five-year hiatus. The new studio album, &quot;Distance Inbetween&quot; was released on 4 March 2016, accompanied by UK and European tours in Spring 2016. Guitarist Paul Molloy joined the band during the recording of the album, replacing Lee Southall who had chosen to take a break from the band in order to focus on his personal life and solo project. In late 2016, the band was joined by Jack Prince as tour percussionist.

===2018–2020: &quot;Move Through The Dawn&quot;===
In April 2018, the band announced their ninth studio album, &quot;Move through the Dawn&quot;, which was then released on 10 August 2018. It was recorded at Liverpool&#x27;s Parr Street Studios and was produced by the band and Rich Turvey.

===2021–present: &quot;Coral Island&quot; ===
On 28 January 2021, The Coral debuted a single, &quot;Faceless Angel&quot;, from their fairground-inspired double album &quot;Coral Island&quot;, which was released on 30 April.

==Musical style and influence==
Despite the &quot;guitar group revival&quot; tag, they had little in common with their peers. Their music was a hybrid of psychedelia, dub reggae, Merseybeat and country, and their lyrics betrayed an obsession with the sea.

The band&#x27;s music is a mixture of 1960s-style psychedelia and folk-rock with old-fashioned country and modern indie rock influences.

==Other projects==
===Solo albums===
Drummer Ian Skelly released a solo album, &quot;Cut from a Star&quot;, on 10 December 2012. He subsequently toured with a 7-piece backing band, The Serpent Power, which included Coral members James Skelly, Paul Duffy and Nick Power. In July 2013 the album was re-released as a deluxe edition double-CD. Following this Ian began working with Paul Molloy under the name Serpent Power, recording an eponymous album released on Skeleton Key Records in May 2015.

Lead singer James Skelly released an album entitled &quot;Love Undercover&quot; on 3 June 2013 with The Intenders, a band comprising Coral members Ian Skelly, Paul Duffy and Nick Power, as well as members of The Sundowners and Tramp Attack. Tracks such as &quot;Do It Again&quot; unveiled a less abstract dimension to the artist&#x27;s songwriting style and highlighted the earthy power of Skelly&#x27;s distinctive vocals. The band toured the UK in June 2013.

Guitarist Lee Southall recorded an album with the singer Molly Jones titled &quot;Goodbye to the River&quot; that was due for release in 2013 under the name Northern Sky, but the album remains unreleased. In response to fans noting his absence after the Coral announced their new album and tour in November 2015, Southall clarified that he was not involved in the album and tour because he was busy working on a solo project, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s where my focus has to be right now&quot;. Ian Skelly noted that Southall&#x27;s recent fatherhood also influenced his decision to take a break from the band, and that he wanted to return once he was done with his solo record.

Bassist Paul Duffy is working on a project in collaboration with Eva Petersen, to soundtrack the animation &quot;Lunar Lament of a Haunted Heart&quot; by John Davide. He has also provided the soundtrack for a short film by Jade Mortimer, titled &quot;Risen&quot;.

Keyboard player Nick Power has published &quot;Small Town Chase&quot;, a book of lyrics and poetry. He has also written and performed with The Lost Brothers on the 2014 album &#x27;New Songs of Dawn and Dust&#x27;. Power contributed two songs, one of which was &#x27;Hotel Loneliness&#x27;. Power&#x27;s second collection &#x27;Holy Nowhere&#x27; was released on 5 December 2015. A new album ‘Throat’ is planned for release 4 October 2024.

===Skeleton Key Records===
Skeleton Key Records was founded as a Liverpool-based independent record label in 2013 by James, Ian and Neville Skelly. The label evolved out of Neville&#x27;s earlier label Watertown Records, on which he had released his own material. James Skelly &amp; the Intenders&#x27; &quot;Love Undercover&quot; (2013) was the first album released by the label, followed by the two-CD deluxe edition of Ian Skelly&#x27;s &quot;Cut from a Star&quot;. Artists signed to the label include James Skelly &amp; the Intenders, Ian Skelly, Neville Skelly, Serpent Power, The Sundowners, Cut Glass Kings, Marvin Powell, She Drew the Gun and the Mysterines.

<doc id="652356" wikidata="Q568375" url="?curid=652356" title="The Path of Daggers">
<text>The Path of Daggers is a fantasy novel by American author Robert Jordan, the eighth book of his series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. It was published by Tor Books and released on October 20, 1998. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the #1 position on the &quot;New York Times&quot; hardcover fiction bestseller list, making it the first &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; book to reach the #1 position on that list. It remained on the list for the next two months. This book is the shortest book in the main &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series, consisting of a prologue and 31 chapters.

The title of the book is a reference to a Seanchan saying: &quot;On the heights, all paths are paved with daggers.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Elayne Trakand, Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, Aviendha, and their coalition of channelers use the &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; called the &#x27;Bowl of the Winds&#x27; to reverse the unnatural heat brought by the Dark One&#x27;s manipulation of the climate, and then escape a Seanchan invasion by &quot;Traveling&quot; to Andor with most of the Kin who had not yet been captured by the Seanchan. In Andor, an Aes Sedai in their party is murdered, and the group realizes that one of its members is part of the Black Ajah. Upon reaching Caemlyn, Elayne initiates her claim to the throne.

Perrin Aybara moves into Ghealdan to stop Masema Dagar, the self-proclaimed Prophet of the Dragon; but unknowingly rescues the deposed Queen Morgase of Andor from the Prophet&#x27;s men. He then secures the oath of fealty from Alliandre, Queen of Ghealdan, and accepts the dubious allegiance of Masema. At the end of the book, Faile Bashere is kidnapped by the Shaido Aiel. Egwene al&#x27;Vere, Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, manipulates her unruly followers into giving her more control, and they Travel to Tar Valon, before their siege of its White Tower.

Rand al&#x27;Thor, accompanied by Bashere with fifty Asha&#x27;man and six thousand Tairens, Cairhienin and Illianers, attempts to repel the Seanchan invasion in Altara. They are successful in early skirmishes, driving the Seanchan from western Altara entirely. Bashere counsels retreat, but Rand decides to push on to Ebou Dar, clashing with a forty thousand strong Seanchan army fifty miles from the city. Both sides bleed each other white in the initial clash, after which both armies pull back to regroup. Rand attempts to destroy the Seanchan by wielding his &quot;sa&#x27;angreal&quot; &#x27;Callandor&#x27;, but loses control of it due to disturbances in saidin caused by the previous usage of the Bowl of the Winds. The result is a lightning storm that devastates his army as well as the Seanchan. Too bloodied to continue fighting, both armies retreat, making the battle a stalemate. Returning to Cairhien, Rand is attacked by traitorous Asha&#x27;man led by Corlan Dashiva, who fail to kill him. Mat Cauthon is absent from the book, due to injuries sustained at the end of the previous book, &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot;. Robert Jordan had earlier done the same for Perrin Aybara, who had been absent from Book 5, &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot;.

<doc id="652361" wikidata="Q7682581" url="?curid=652361" title="Tanfield Railway">
<text>The Tanfield Railway is a heritage railway in Gateshead and County Durham, England. Running on part of a former horse-drawn colliery wooden waggonway, later rope &amp; horse, lastly rope &amp; loco railway. It operates preserved industrial steam locomotives. The railway operates a passenger service every Sunday, plus other days, as well as occasional demonstration coal, goods and mixed trains. The line runs between a southern terminus at East Tanfield, Durham, to a northern terminus at Sunniside, Gateshead. Another station, Andrews House, is situated near the Marley Hill engine shed. A halt also serves the historic site of the Causey Arch. The railway claims it is &quot;the world&#x27;s oldest railway&quot; because it runs on a section dating from 1725, other parts being in use since 1621.

The railway is run by three bodies: &quot;Friends of Tanfield Railway&quot;, &quot;Tanfield Railway Trust&quot; which owns the railway, the locomotives and rolling stock and &quot;The Tanfield Railway Company&quot; which operates the railway.

&quot;The Tanfield Railway Company&quot; is split into four departments; each has a manager and director: Engineering who maintain locomotives, Operations including drivers and guards, Carriage &amp; Waggon who preserve carriages, and Commercial which operates shops, events and the passenger side of operations.

== Colliery railway ==

The Tanfield Waggonway was built by the Grand Allies, an association of coal-owning families, including the Bowes, Liddells, Ords and Montagues, who joined together to overcome wayleave difficulties from about 1720. Its purpose was to transport coal more reliably and cheaply from the inland collieries of County Durham to the staiths on the River Tyne at Redheugh. From there the coal was transported in keels downriver to Shields, then transferred to colliers (bulk coal carrying ships) for the voyage down the North Sea coast to south east England. Many older shorter coal waggonways existed to the north of the present heritage line, in the Whickham and Lobley Hill areas, but the Tanfield Waggonway was a much longer and heavily engineered route which gave the Grand Allies market dominance all year round. (Although supply to SE England was still subject to North Sea winters.) The Tanfield route was in continuous use from 1725 until final closure in 1964.

The route and structures of the oldest section of the now preserved part of the line, between Sunniside and Causey, dates from 1725, and is thus the world&#x27;s oldest railway still in operation.
(The Middleton Railway makes an alternative claim to be the oldest railway, as the first railway granted powers under the first railway act of parliament in 1758.) The Causey to East Tanfield section was built in 1839.

The Marley Hill engine shed was built by 1854, and was in industrial use until 1970. The shed is on the Bowes Railway, whereas locos used on the Tanfield branch were stabled at the nearby Bowes Bridge MPD (a sub-shed of Gateshead), the coaling ramp and turntable pit of which are still visible adjacent to the track between Andrews House and Sunniside. A winding engine occupied the Bowes Bridge site from 1840 to 1881, a locomotive shed from 1881 to 1962. The headshunt by Marley Hill signal box is the point where the west-east Bowes Railway crossed the south-north Tanfield branch. When the Tanfield Railway began running trains in 1977 a curve was installed to allow Marley Hill locos and trains onto the Tanfield Branch. Marley Hill engine shed is the oldest in the world still used for its original function. As collieries on the NCB line closed in the 1960s, coal was brought by road to adjacent drops for onward rail transport, and the shed saw further use servicing other local colliery locomotives.

Originally a wooden railed horse drawn waggonway, conversion to a steel railed railway began in 1837, and by 1840 was complete as far as Tanfield Moor Colliery, using stationary steam engines, gravity inclines and horses. In 1881, while operated by the North Eastern Railway, steam locomotives replaced the stationary steam engines and horses. Although primarily a coal railway, it did carry some passengers. The railway closed when the last colliery on the line at East Tanfield ceased production in 1964.

== Preservation ==

The early years of the railway as a preservation project concentrated on Marley Hill, preparing locos for steaming, working on the shed structure and acquiring basic needs such as water and electricity. Locomotives No.21 (Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns engine of 1954 0-4-0st) and No.5 (Malleable) were steamed in public in 1973. The first passenger train ran for a week August 1975, using locomotives No.21, No.32 and Sir Cecil A Cochrane, and a small carriage acquired from the British Steel Corporation site at Teesside.

The preserved line was first built from Marley Hill to the current northern terminus, Sunniside Station, with passenger trains beginning on 2 July 1981, and an official opening ceremony on 14 July 1982. Andrews House station just south of Marley Hill sheds was completed between 1987 and 1989 and was equipped with platforms, a water tower, a station building and a footbridge. The first train south to Causey was on 27 July 1991, with the official opening ceremony being held on 15 August 1991. The first train further south to the current end of the line at East Tanfield occurred on 18 October 1992. East Tanfield Station itself was opened in 1997. The Causey to Tanfield section is through a wood lined gorge.

Part of the reason the line was preserved was the fact Marley Hill shed remained open until 1970. The vintage machinery in the workshop is still capable of full locomotive overhauls. The oldest locomotive on the railway was built in Gateshead in 1873, and all of the railway&#x27;s carriage stock dates from the 19th Century.

== Causey Arch ==

The current preserved line passes near to Causey Arch, the oldest surviving railway bridge in the world. It was built to carry a new branch from the route of the now preserved line to a site known as Dawson&#x27;s Drift. Built between 1725 and 1727, at and , it was the largest single-span bridge in Britain, and remained so for 30 years.

<text>The Commercial Neutral Broadcasting Company (CNBC) was an English language pirate radio station which hired airtime for a few hours each day from the Dutch pirate Radio Veronica in 1960–1961. Programmes were pre-recorded at Veronica&#x27;s Amsterdam studio together with the Dutch programmes, and broadcast from the Veronica ship &quot;Borkum Riff&quot;. The address for prospective advertisers was given as Ross Radio Productions Ltd, 23 Upper Wimpole Street, W1.

CNBC has the distinction of being the first pirate station to broadcast to the United Kingdom, almost four years before Radio Caroline, although few British listeners ever heard it as its signal originated from the Dutch side of the North Sea and did not penetrate very far inland. After only a few months Veronica terminated its contract because the advertising revenue from Dutch programming was more lucrative.

<text>Piotr Wilniewczyc (1887–1960) was a Polish engineer and arms designer. Among his most successful designs were the Vis-35 pistol, commonly known as the Radom for the arsenal in which it was produced, and the Mors submachine gun.

== Biography ==
Piotr Wilniewczyc was born on 31 January 1887 near Irkutsk in Siberia. He grew up in Vilna (now Vilnius, Lithuania). In 1905 he moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, and studied at the University of St. Petersburg institute of mathematics and physics. He continued his studies in the Lwów Polytechnic department of chemistry. In 1915 Wilniewczyc also graduated from artillery school in St. Petersburg.

In 1921 he accepted employment at the Boryszew Gunpowder Factory near Sochaczew, Poland. From 1924 to 1928, Wilniewczyc also lectured at the Artillery Officers&#x27; School in Toruń. In 1928 he began work as director of the ballistics department at the State Arms Factories (&quot;Państwowe Wytwórnie Uzbrojenia&quot;), holding this post until war broke out in September 1939.

His most successful project was the Vis-35 pistol, a standard Polish prewar military pistol. He also designed the Mors submachine gun, which did not enter production due to the outbreak of war. After the war, he directed a team that designed the Rak wz. 63 submachine gun, completed after his death.

During the war, Wilniewczyc worked with the Home Army in Warsaw, developing a silencer for the Sten gun. After the Warsaw Uprising he moved to Łódź and soon began lecturing at the Łódź Polytechnic. From 1948 he also worked at the reopened Warsaw Polytechnic.

Wilniewczyc died on 23 December 1960 and was interred at Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Cemetery.

<text>Darryl Neudorf (born June 7, 1964 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian musician, record producer and audio engineer.

He was the drummer for 54-40 from 1982 to 1986. He is best known during this time for co-writing the hit song &quot;I Go Blind&quot;, a Canadian hit which was later covered by U.S. rock group Hootie and the Blowfish.

He has also worked as a producer for a number of other recording artists, including Sarah McLachlan, Neko Case, The New Pornographers, Kevin Kane, Kinnie Starr, Twilight Circus Dub Sound System, Dead Voices on Air, Justin Rutledge, Jim Bryson, Jim Cuddy, Bob Egan, The Sadies, and Blue Rodeo.

Neudorf continues to produce and mix music at his residential recording studio, located in Kelowna, British Columbia.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Darryl Neudorf grew up in Kelowna, British Columbia, where his parents bought him a drum kit for Christmas when he was ten years old.

Throughout his teens Neudorf picked fruit in orchards, worked at The Pop Shop, skateboarded around Kelowna and formed the band Empty Set with his sister Adele Neudorf, Kevin Kane and Jon Brotherton.

===54-40===
At 18, Darryl Neudorf moved to Vancouver and joined the band 54-40 as their drummer. They recorded two albums, toured extensively in North America and at the time of his departure, 54-40 had signed a deal with Warner/Reprise. The songs that Neudorf performed, co-composed and produced with 54-40 helped to catapult their career, achieving gold and platinum status in Canada. In 1986, after four years in the band, Neudorf left 54-40 to pursue a career in music production.

===Recording work===
In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for Nettwerk Productions involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named Sarah McLachlan. This recording, the album &quot;Touch&quot;, resulted in garnering the interest of Arista Records. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in Canada. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, &quot;Solace&quot;.

In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, Nettwerk, alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on &quot;Touch&quot;, and alleging that he wasn&#x27;t paid properly for work done on &quot;Solace&quot;. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan&#x27;s favour on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the songwriting, neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf&#x27;s favour on the payment issue.

===Miller Block===
In 1994, in Vancouver&#x27;s Downtown Eastside, Darryl Neudorf and Tracy Pillsworth met with Tom Anselmi of the band Copyright. The three met on the top floor of a building that was built in 1948 through Jim Carrico who had found the Hastings Street space for lease. An artists&#x27; co-operative was about to burgeon and become home to a group of people generating dozens of CDs and vinyl representing Vancouver&#x27;s eclectic underground. Neudorf and Pillsworth lent Anselmi their recording equipment to record what was to become Copyright&#x27;s second CD, Love Story. The building of a recording studio that was soundproofed and secure followed. The studio was named after the arched words painted in gold on the front of the building&#x27;s black and green tiled facade; Miller Block was born.

Throughout the 1990s, Neudorf designed, managed, owned and operated Miller Block with Tracy Pillsworth (aka Sugarpill), where he did much of his recording and production. This work resulted in scores of releases in a wide variety of genres from underground rock to roots rock to country to avant-garde electronica. Among others, this list includes Cub, Duotang, Neko Case, Kinnie Starr, Herald Nix, The New Pornographers, Superconductor, Kevin Kane, I Am Spoonbender, Twilight Circus Dub Sound System, Faust and Dead Voices on Air. The merging of equipment, space and trust surrounding Miller Block resulted in a creative studio environment that flourished for six years, until the Fall of 2000.

===Relocation===
In 2001, Darryl Neudorf, Tracy Pillsworth and the boxed up studio moved to Toronto, Ontario. Once in Toronto, Neudorf continued to produce and engineer successful recordings, among others, Americana singer Neko Case.

===The Audio Recording Academy===
During 2002 Darryl Neudorf was asked by Shannon Murray to become the head instructor at, and design the curriculum for, a new audio production school located in downtown Toronto called The Audio Recording Academy. Neudorf remained head teacher until 2008 when during an indefinite leave, producer / engineer Damon de Szegheo took over head instructor duties.

===Operation Northwoods Recording Services===
In November 2004, after looking for a resort-styled location to set up a recording studio, Darryl Neudorf and Tracy Pillsworth found a creative retreat.

The studio was called Operation Northwoods Recording Services where musicians have produced recordings with Neudorf at the helm, with him either producing, mixing, engineering, drumming and mastering. Among others, these musicians include The Sadies, Jim Cuddy, Justin Rutledge, Bob Egan, The Mohawk Lodge, Jim Bryson, Neko Case, Two Hours Traffic, The Grapes of Wrath, Brementown Players, Robyn Cage, Lily Frost, Blue Rodeo and The Weather Station.

Neudorf relocated to his home town of Kelowna in 2019.

<text>The Barberini Gospels is an illuminated Hiberno-Saxon manuscript Gospel Book (Rome, Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica, Barberini Lat. 570, also known as the Wigbald Gospels), assumed to be of a late 8th-century origin.

==History==

After coming to light following its move to the Vatican Library in 1902 this luxury Gospel book had been largely ignored by the academic community until it became the subject of a doctoral dissertation in 2004. Earlier writing includes some brief comparisons of its iconography with that of its contemporaries and an inconclusive debate regarding the site of its production. There have also been speculations about a colophon, an entreaty for the reader to pray for one Wigbald and its role in providing a connection to a specific historical context. It is not known whether this is the same person as Wigbold, author of the &quot;Quaestiones in Octateuchum&quot;.

==Illumination==

The &quot;Barberini Gospels&quot; contains one illuminated canon table, four Evangelist portraits, and fifteen decorated initials. The book follows a fairly standard format in which each separate Gospel book opens with an evangelist portrait of the author and a large decorated initial, or &quot;incipit&quot;, at the beginning of the text. Another large decorated initial, often referred to as the “monogram of Christ,” punctuates the beginning of Matthew&#x27;s account of the Incarnation; more initials are inserted in a similar fashion at key points in the other Gospel texts.
Key to the treatment of the origin of the &quot;Barberini Gospels&quot; is the striking contrast between two very distinct traditions and painting styles. On the one hand are the elaborate and intricately decorated initials one comes to expect in insular manuscripts of this period. The technical expertise of these embellishments is at the same level as those of better-known manuscripts such as the &quot;Book of Kells&quot; or the &quot;Lichfield Gospels&quot;. On the other hand, there are many elements employed in the decoration of this Gospel book which do not seem to belong here, either because they more closely resemble motifs found in non-insular or Continental art or because they are too early, foreshadowing trends of a later, even Romanesque period.

<text>Royal Air Force Valley or more simply RAF Valley () is a Royal Air Force station on the island of Anglesey, Wales, and which is also used as Anglesey Airport. It provides both basic and advanced fast-jet training using the Beechcraft Texan T.1 and BAE Systems Hawk T.2 and provides mountain and maritime training for aircrew using the Airbus Jupiter HT.1 helicopter.

==History==
===Second World War===
The airfield was constructed to the south of the village of Valley (Y Fali) or Y Dyffryn in the latter part of 1940 and opened for operations on 1 February 1941 as a Fighter Sector Station under No. 9 Group RAF with the task of providing defence cover for England&#x27;s industrial north-west and shipping in the Irish Sea. Initial detachments were made by Hawker Hurricanes of 312 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF and 615 (County of Surrey) Squadron RAuxAF. A detachment of Bristol Beaufighters of 219 (Mysore) Squadron provided night fighter cover.
No. 456 Squadron Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) formed at Valley on 30 June 1941 and became operational on 5 September flying Boulton Paul Defiants. By November the squadron had been completely re-equipped with Beaufighter IIs, and these provided defensive night patrols over the Irish Sea until March 1943, when the unit moved to RAF Middle Wallop.

As a result of many accidents in the Irish Sea, due to the number of training aircraft active in the area, 275 Squadron formed at Valley in October 1941, equipped with Westland Lysanders and Supermarine Walrus amphibians and these performed Air-sea rescue (ASR) missions until the unit moved to RAF Warmwell in April 1944.

The runways and taxiways were extended in early 1943, and on 19 June 1943 the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Ferry Terminal became operational. This handled American aircraft arriving from transatlantic flights and on European sorties. Eleven Consolidated B-24 Liberators of the United States Navy arrived from Iceland on 17 August. During the winter of 1943/1944, the ferry route was switched to a southerly route via the Azores and Marrakesh and on 18 February, 62 Douglas C-47 Skytrains arrived from North Africa. One of Valley&#x27;s busiest days was on 17 September 1944 when 99 USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Liberators were ferried in from Iceland. In the middle of 1944 there was a daily transatlantic Douglas C-54 Skymaster service from Stephenville bringing airmen of all ranks, who continued their journeys to London on the LMSR &quot;Irish Mail&quot; train from Holyhead.

Because of the large scale USAAF activities at Valley, RAF operations were scaled down, but on 1 November 1944, No. 1528 BAT Flight re-formed here operating Airspeed Oxford twin-engined aircraft which were used in the Beam Approach training role until moving out on 17 December 1945.

RAF Valley&#x27;s USAAF ferry role was reversed as soon as the European War ended, and over 2,600 bombers passed through on their way back to the US for redeployment, each carrying 20 passengers and crew. The USAAF Movement Section closed in September 1945, and in June 1947 the airfield was put on a care and maintenance basis.

===Postwar operations===
During 1950 many improvements were made to the hangars and buildings at Valley, and on 1 April 1951 No. 202 Advanced Flying School was reformed here within No. 25 Group to train fighter pilots on de Havilland Vampire and Gloster Meteor jet aircraft. Vampire FB.5 and T.11 and Meteor T.7 marks were used until the unit was redesignated No. 7 Flying Training School (FTS) on 1 June 1954. On 15 August 1960 the unit was renumbered No. 4 FTS RAF which is still based at the airfield.

The first Folland Gnat jet trainers were received on 7 November 1962 and many examples of the type were successfully operated for many years. These were supplemented by Hawker Hunters for advanced training, marks F.6 and T.7 being used. The first Hawker Siddeley Hawk T.1s arrived on 11 November 1976 and a modified version of this type is still in use by 4 FTS called the BAE Systems Hawk T.2.

RAF Valley previously hosted the Headquarters and &#x27;C Flight&#x27; of No. 22 Squadron, part of the RAF&#x27;s Search and Rescue Force. By October 2015, the RAF SAR Force had been relieved of their responsibility by a new contractor-led operation, run by Bristow Helicopters, and the nearest SAR unit is now based at Caernarfon Airport. The RAF Operational Conversion Unit, 203(R) Squadron, was also based at Valley to train new aircrew onto the Westland Sea King HAR.3/3A, and prepare them for their SAR operations. The then Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, now heir apparent to the British Throne, was assigned to C Flight, 22 Squadron at RAF Valley, as a pilot flying the Sea King search and rescue helicopter. He finished his last shift as a pilot on Tuesday 10 September 2013.

No. 208(R) Squadron, which provided legacy Hawk T.1 advanced flying training and tactical weapons training, disbanded in June 2016.

In September 2017, a project to upgrade the airfield was completed. The project involved resurfacing of the runway and link taxiways and the creation of a new section of airside perimeter road. New visual aids, aeronautical lighting and signage were installed. A hangar was refurbished to accommodate three Jupiter HT.1 helicopters which will be used to train pilots from all three British armed services, as part of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS). On 20 March 2018 a BAE Systems Hawk of the Red Arrows aerobatic team crashed, killing Corporal Jonathan Bayliss, an engineer. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant David Stark, survived and was treated in hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. Due to increased demand for RAF and Royal Navy pilots, No. 25 Squadron reformed at Valley on 8 September 2018. The squadron operates the Hawk T.2 alongside No. 4 Squadron as part of No. 4 Flying Training School.

On 28 November 2019, No. 72 Squadron was officially &quot;stood up&quot; at RAF Valley, flying the Beechcraft Texan T.1 aircraft in the basic flying training role. The squadron transitioned from Short Tucano (RAF Linton-on-Ouse) to Texan (RAF Valley) in a major investment by the UK Military Flying Training System. The squadron operates a fleet of 10 Texan T.1s, so that RAF Valley is now home to two-thirds of fast jet training, delivering both basic and advanced courses.

In May 2020, Virginia Crosbie, MP for Ynys Môn and members of the Senedd wrote to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) seeking assurance that travel to and from the base was limited to critical journeys during the COVID-19 pandemic. The MoD told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that training remained under &quot;constant review&quot;.

On 25 May 2020 a Pilatus PC-12 landed at RAF Valley while the base was closed for maintenance work. Initially staff thought it was an emergency landing, but the pilot said he landed there &quot;to go to the beach&quot;. When told about the lockdown and coronavirus restrictions he was reported to have replied &quot;it was okay, because he had [the virus] two months ago&quot;. He had flown from Fairoaks Airport and had noticed RAF Valley on Google Earth and decided to land there as Wikipedia said it served civilian traffic. He left shortly after landing. The Ministry of Defence said that while civilian traffic were allowed at its sites, 24 hours notice is required to make sure it does not impact military activity. The incident was reported to the Civil Aviation Authority.

== Role and operations ==

No. 4 Flying Training School (No. 4 FTS) trains RAF and Royal Navy pilots to fly fast jets, prior to training on an Operational Conversion Unit. No. 4 FTS consist of three units, No. 72 Squadron, No. 4 Squadron and No. 25 Squadron, flying the Texan T.1 and BAE Systems Hawk T.2.

The base is also home to No. 202 Squadron, part of No.1 Flying Training School, flying three Airbus Jupiter HT.1. The squadron trains RAF and Royal Navy students on maritime and mountain flying training and those who are destined for the Royal Navy&#x27;s anti-submarine warfare Merlin or Wildcat.

==Based units==
Flying and notable non-flying units based at RAF Valley.

==Civilian airport==

The National Assembly for Wales announced on 21 February 2007 that public service obligation (PSO) flights would be launched from RAF Valley in April 2007, connecting north Wales with Cardiff International Airport. Flights from RAF Valley to Cardiff stopped after the first set of government COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in March 2020. On 8 June 2022, the Welsh Government axed the service, leaving the purpose-built civilian airport terminal disused.

<text>The South African Special Forces Brigade, colloquially known as the Recces (from &quot;reconnaisance&quot;), is South Africa&#x27;s principal Tier 1 special operations forces, specialising in various types of operations, including counter-insurgency, long-range-reconnaissance, unconventional-warfare, and hostage rescue. The brigade operates with two active-duty groups, with 4 Special Forces Regiment focusing on maritime operations, and 5 Special Forces Regiment focusing on land and airborne operations. Only about 8% of recruits who undergo South African special forces training pass the course.

The South African Special Forces Brigade has its roots in the Hunter Group, which was formed in 1968 as an elite counter-insurgency unit of the South African Army. The success of this unit culminated in the subsequent formation of five reconnaissance units, known widely as &quot;Recces&quot;, during the 1970s. South African special forces carried out a number of combat operations during the Rhodesian Bush War, the South African Border War, and the Mozambican Civil War. 
The Special Forces Brigade&#x27;s current structure is the result of extensive restructuring related to the integration of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) between 1992 and 1996. Elements of the brigade are expanded into two additional groups; though termed &quot;regiments&quot;, they consist only of small numbers of operators who are secretive, seldom photographed, and expertly trained. The current regiments include 4 Special Forces Regiment based at Langebaan in Western Cape Province, and 5 Special Forces Regiment based at Phalaborwa in the eastern part of the province of Limpopo.

Special forces are directly under the command of the Joint Operations Division of the SANDF, and unlike other similar forces worldwide, are not a part of the South African Army nor the South African Navy, but are rather operated as its own branch/service within the SANDF.

== History ==
The first South African Special Forces unit, 1 Reconnaissance Commando, was established in the town of Oudtshoorn, Cape Province on 1 October 1972. On 1 January 1975, this unit was relocated to Durban, Natal, where it continued its activities as the airborne specialist unit of the special forces.

Later, five additional Reconnaissance Commandos were formed:
* 2 Reconnaissance Commando (Citizen Force) – was established in Johannesburg. It was later retired due to rationalisation and the discontinuation of the Citizen Force unit concept
* 3 Reconnaissance Commando (consisting of former Rhodesian Selous Scouts) – was established in Phalaborwa. An attempt to integrate this unit into the South African Military was largely unsuccessful. The unit was disbanded in 1981, and the limited number of remaining personnel were incorporated into the other Special Forces unit.
* 4 Reconnaissance Commando, specialising in seaborne operations, was established in the coastal town of Langebaan, Cape Province.
* 5 Reconnaissance Commando was established at the Duku-Duku camp in Natal, but was later moved to Phalaborwa in the Transvaal province.
* 6 Reconnaissance Commando (consisting of former Rhodesian Special Air Service) – was established in Durban. An attempt to integrate this unit into the South African Military was largely unsuccessful. It was disbanded in 1981, and the limited number of remaining personnel were incorporated into the other Special Forces units.

Many white members of the Rhodesian special forces were recruited into the SADF in 1980 as part of Operation Winter and served with the South African Special Forces.

On 1 January 1981, a re-organisation of Special Forces took place, as part of which the Reconnaissance Commandos and other special forces were transformed into an independent formation, directly under the command of the (then) South African Defence Force (instead of the South African Army). As part of the re-organisation, the various Reconnaissance Commandos were also given the status of regiments. In the latter part of the same decade, a Special Forces headquarters and a Special Forces stores depot were also added to the Special Forces structure.

Between the years 1981 and 1990, Special Forces was home to unconventional operations such as Project Barnacle, the Civil Cooperation Bureau and other operations conducted under the aegis of 7 Medical Battalion Group.

In 1991, the structure of the special forces underwent another change, when the special forces headquarters was disbanded and a Directorate Reconnaissance, reporting directly to the Chief of the Army, was established instead.

Another organisational change followed in 1993, when the Directorate Reconnaissance became 45 Parachute Brigade. As a result of this, all the units were renamed: 1 Reconnaissance Regiment became 452 Parachute Battalion, 4 Reconnaissance Regiment became 453 Parachute Battalion and 5 Reconnaissance Regiment became 451 Parachute Battalion.

As part of the military rationalization process, 1 Special Forces Regiment was disbanded in 1996. Its personnel were incorporated into the other Special Forces Regiments.

In 1997, the Special Forces School was transferred to 5 Special Forces Regiment upon the retirement of 1 Special Forces Regiment where the School had previously been based. The Special Forces School was transferred out of 5 Special Forces Regiment in 2002, to become a stand-alone unit.

== Structure ==
The Special Forces Brigade, as it is now known, consists of:

===Headquarters===
Based in Pretoria. The General Officer Commanding (GOC) Special Forces commands, controls and coordinates the activities of the various SF Regiments from a headquarters (HQ) located in the Swartkop Park nature reserve on the southwestern outskirts of Pretoria. Colloquially called &quot;Speskop&quot;, the headquarters also houses the Special Forces&#x27; operational planning as well as administrative support staffs.

===4 Special Forces Regiment===
4 Special Forces Regiment is based in Langebaan, Saldanha Bay, on the west coast north of Cape Town. It provides South Africa its seaward Special Forces capability. The unit was established at Langebaan in 1978. The Regiment consists of three operational commandos (companies) as well as a Special Forces Amphibious and Urban School.

===5 Special Forces Regiment===
5 Special Forces Regiment is based in Phalaborwa in the east of the northern Limpopo Province, and was established in Durban in 1976. After a sojourn at Duku Duku in northern KwaZulu-Natal, the unit moved into its present lines in 1980. Its post-2002 structure provides for two operational commandos, called and respectively, and a training wing. It specialises in overland operations, especially long-range infiltration, intelligence gathering and airborne operations.

===South African Special Forces Reserve===
Retired Special Forces personnel form part of the Special Forces Reserve. They are assigned to the various Special Forces Regiments as required.

===South African Special Forces School===
Based in Murrayhill, the South African Special Forces School is responsible for the presentation of the Special Forces Pre-Selection and Selection courses and ongoing training.

===South African Special Forces Supply Unit===
The South African Special Forces Supply Unit provides logistical support and is based in Walmansthal, North of Pretoria.

In the Special Forces regiments, leadership positions, especially at team (section) and group (platoon) level, have traditionally been dictated more by ability and experience than rank. This has, on occasion, resulted in Operators more senior in rank being assigned to groups or teams commanded by Operators junior to them in rank but more seasoned in operational experience or actual command.

== Selection and Training ==
The Ultimate Challenge, as South African Special Forces Selection is often called, is considered one of the most difficult special forces selection courses in the world. A soldier must meet very high requirements to even attend Special Forces Selection. In accordance with SANDF regulations, only South African citizens under a certain age are permitted to apply.

===Pre-selection testing===

This includes all aspects of psychological and physical tests. For the psychological tests, soldiers are given written tests and oral interviews with Special Forces NCOs. A soldier must be self-controlled and mature. Soldiers are ejected from the course if there is any suggestion of mental instability. The Physical Test includes for example 50 continuous push ups without breaking rhythm, 67 sit ups in two minutes, 175-metre fireman&#x27;s lift run within 65 seconds, 5-kilometre run within 24 minutes, a rope climb and 40 six-metre shuttle runs in 95 seconds. A student must also scale a wall, complete a fifteen-kilometre march in less than 120 minutes and perform 120 shuttle kicks.

===Parachute selection course===

All Special Forces candidates who aren&#x27;t already parachute-qualified have to attend, and pass, the Basic Parachute School.

===Special Forces selection===

Selection is an event during which candidates are placed in an extremely mentally and physically demanding set of situations and circumstances, through which they must pass. It is in duration approximately a week.

For the duration of Selection, the candidates do not sleep or eat, and have no rest period at all. Only an extremely small percentage of those who begin Selection ever pass it. In some years, no-one has managed to pass Selection, and there are other cases where only 1 or 2 out of an entire Selection group of approximately 120 have passed.

===Training cycle===

Once past the Selection process, an aspiring operator will be placed on a training cycle to acquire the skills required. These include: air co-operation, water orientation, obstacle crossing, bushcraft, tracking and survival, demolitions and tactics in urban as well as rural areas.

Advanced Airborne Training: a recruit will attend courses in military free-fall such as HALO and HAHO. They will also learn about helicopter operations – how to descend by means of a rope out of helicopters (fast-roping and rappel ). Combat extraction is also taught, along with learning how to set up a Landing Zone.

Land training consists of many things: including sniping, demolitions and reconnaissance. Bushcraft and survival is also taught. Climbing and photography are taught to new recruits. Urban and rural combat is perhaps the newest training – developed quite recently, this training provided South Africa with a new counter-terrorist force. Medical and communications training is also given to those who wish to become qualified in these fields.

Maritime training consists of the use of small boats, underwater demolitions, swimming, combat diving, diving, beach reconnaissance and navigation.

== Operations ==

===1973–94 SADF Operations===

The South African &quot;Recces&quot; were deployed to many local hot spots during the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly Angola.

The main enemy then was South West Africa&#x27;s People Organization whose armed wing PLAN, was a guerrilla organization fighting for an independent Namibia.

One of the &quot;Recces&quot;&#x27; most effective operations came in 1982: Operation Mebos penetrated deep into Angola and destroyed the SWAPO Headquarters. In Operation Askari, in the winter of 1984, the &quot;Recces&quot; cut off almost all supply lines to and from the SWAPO in Angola. In May 1985, a &quot;Recce&quot; team undertook the controversial Operation Argon, a failed attempt to sabotage Angolan oil installations run by Gulf Oil.

In early summer of 1985, another &quot;Recce&quot; team under the command of SADF Captain André Diedericks crossed into Angola&#x27;s Cuando Cubango province, and with UNITA&#x27;s help, protection and escort was secretly deployed around Menongue area. The team had at their disposal the 9K31 &quot;Strela-1&quot; AA system manned and operated by the team members. The Team&#x27;s mission was to carry out covert combat operations, code names &quot;Catamaran 1,&quot; &quot;Catamaran 2&quot; and &quot;Cerberus&quot; with the goal of disrupting air traffic in Cuando Cubango province by shooting down air transports, combat aircraft and gunships using the AA system.

On 11 June 1985, roughly from Menongue, the team shot down an Angolan airplane, a light utility aircraft, Britten-Norman BN-2 &quot;Islander&quot;. The &quot;Islander&quot;, en route from Menongue to Cuito Cuanavale with a crew of 2 and 5 passengers, was also carrying 69 million kwanzas (Angola&#x27;s currency), several months of salary for FAPLA&#x27;s 16th Brigade&#x27;s personnel based in Cuito Cuanavale. When the &quot;Islander&quot; fell to the ground the money was stolen and the remains of the dead passengers had been pillaged by UNITA soldiers attached to protect the &quot;Recce&quot; team.
On 25 November 1985, the same &quot;Recce&quot; team had also shot down an &quot;Aeroflot&quot; Antonov AN-12 of the Soviet Air Force. The AN-12 transport, which was &quot;en route&quot; from Cuito Cuanavale to Luanda carrying 8 crew members and 13 passengers, crashed approximately south-east of Menongue. All people on board (twelve Soviet and nine Angolan nationals) died in the crash.

===Post-1994 SANDF Operations===
====Central African Republic====
Operators of the South African Special Forces were involved in direct action against the Séléka rebels in the Fight for Bangui during the South African military assistance to the Central African Republic. No South African Special Forces operators were killed in the operation. All casualties were attributed to 1 Parachute Battalion which lost 13 soldiers, with a further 27 injured, during pitched battles on the outskirts of the capital, Bangui.

====Democratic Republic of the Congo====
The South African Special Forces were integral to the Battle of Kibati, which saw about 3000 M23 rebels defeated by several thousand members of the Force Intervention Brigade supported by local troops. An operator of the SASF, as part of the FIB, made the 8th longest recorded sniper kill in history with a confirmed distance of using a South African made Denel NTW-20 anti-materiel rifle in its configuration. SASF still continue to operate in the country.

====Mozambique====
 teams were deployed to Cabo Delgado Province under Operation Vikela. On 20 December 2021 an operator, corporal Tebogo Edwin Radebe, was killed in action. His death represents the first SASF operator to be killed in action since corporal Hermann Carstens in 1989. The SASF have since engaged ISIS-Mozambique in small skirmishes, resulting in many enemy losses.

== Insignia ==

=== Operator&#x27;s Badge ===
All members who complete all the required qualifications to become a Special Forces Operator, are awarded an &quot;Operator&#x27;s Badge&quot;. Each badge is numbered and a register of the numbers and who they have been awarded to is kept.
The badge consists of an inverted Commando Knife within a laurel wreath, which is meant to symbolise both special forces (the knife) and victory (the wreath).

Standard operator badges are silver, but a gold badge with an embedded diamond is awarded to Operators with more than 10 years of active service.

The latest badges designed for wear on the camouflage combat dress are black embossed plastic on a thatch green background.

<text>Veracruz (), also known as Heroica Veracruz, is a major port city and municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico and the most populous city in the Mexican state of Veracruz. The city is located along the coast in the central part of the state, southeast of the state capital Xalapa.

It is the state&#x27;s most populous city, with a population that is greater than the municipality&#x27;s population, as part of the city of Veracruz extends into the neighboring municipality of Boca del Río. At the 2020 census, Veracruz Municipality had a population of 607,209 inhabitants. The city of Veracruz had a population of 537,952 inhabitants, 405,952 in Veracruz municipality and 132,011 in Boca del Río municipality. Developed during Spanish colonization, Veracruz is Mexico&#x27;s oldest, largest, and historically most significant port.

When the Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés arrived in what is now Mexican territory on 22 April 1519, he founded a city, which he named &quot;Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz&quot;, referring to the area&#x27;s gold and dedicated to the &quot;True Cross&quot;, because he landed on the Christian holy day of Good Friday, the day of the Crucifixion. It was the first Spanish settlement on the mainland of the Americas to receive a coat-of-arms. During the colonial period, this city had the largest mercantile class and was at times wealthier than the capital, Mexico City. Its wealth attracted the raids of 17th-century pirates, against which fortifications such as Fort San Juan de Ulúa were built. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Veracruz was invaded on different occasions by France and the United States; in the aftermath of the 1914 Tampico Affair, US troops occupied the city for seven months. For much of the 20th century, the production of petroleum was most important for the state&#x27;s economy but, in the latter 20th century and into the 21st, the port has re-emerged as the main economic engine. It has become the principal port for most of Mexico&#x27;s imports and exports, especially for the automotive industry.

Veracruz has a blend of cultures, mostly indigenous, Spanish and Afro-Caribbean. The influence of these three is best seen in the food and music of the area, which has strong Spanish, Caribbean and African influences.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Veracruz&quot; (originally &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;), derives from the Latin &quot;Vera Crux&quot; (True Cross). Having established the settlement of &quot;Villa Rica&quot; (Rich Village) on Good Friday, 22 April 1519, Cortés dedicated the place to the True Cross as an offering.

==History==
=== Viceroyalty of New Spain (1518–1821) ===

The Spanish captain Juan de Grijalva, along with Bernal Díaz del Castillo, first arrived in 1518 at the island later known as San Juan de Ulúa. The Spanish gave it that name because they landed on the Christian feast of John the Baptist (24 June), and in honor of the captain. &quot;De Ulúa&quot; is derived from the local name for the Aztecs, &quot;coluha&quot; or &quot;acolhua.&quot; The word for Aztec evolved into Ulúa.

While Veracruz itself was founded by Hernán Cortés who arrived in 1519, the area at the time was within the jurisdiction of Moctezuma II and his Aztec Empire. Cortés and his men landed at the shore opposite the island where Grijalva had moored, which has the pre-Hispanic name of Chalchihuecan. Cortés, Francisco de Montejo and Alonso Hernández Puertocarrero founded the settlement, naming it Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz. The name &quot;Villa Rica&quot; (rich village) referred to the gold that was found here and &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; (True Cross) was added because the Cortés expedition landed on Good Friday, a Christian holy day. When Cortés and his soldiers abolished the Aztec despotism and elected a &quot;Justicia Mayor&quot; and a &quot;Capitán General&quot;, they created the first city council on the American continent. The city was the first on mainland America to receive a European coat of arms, which was authorized by Carlos V in Valladolid, Spain, on 4 July 1523.

The original settlement was moved in 1525 to what is now known as Antigua, at the mouth of the Huitzilapan (or Antigua River) shortly thereafter. This separated the city from the port, as ships could not enter the shallow river. Ships continued to dock at San Juan de Ulúa, with small boats being used to ferry goods on and off the ships.

As in other parts of Mexico, the indigenous peoples suffered from epidemics of European infectious diseases, which decimated the population after contact. The Portuguese Empire began to import African slaves via the port of Veracruz. In the 16th century, the state had more slaves than any other in Mexico. Before the slave trade was abolished, Mexico had the second-highest population of African slaves in the Americas, following Brazil.

Veracruz was the most important port in New Spain, with a large wealthy merchant class that was more prosperous than that of Mexico City. Each of the two yearly voyages of the Spanish treasure fleet to and from Spain were to gather at Veracruz stevedores, muleteers, navigators, sailors, contractors, merchants and civil servants. In 1568 the Armada admiral Francisco Luján defeated the British pirates John Hawkins and Francis Drake on their attempt to take hold of Veracruz. By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish had constructed roads to link Veracruz with other cities such as Córdoba, Orizaba, Puebla, Xalapa and Perote. Their gold and silver were the principal exports. 

This caused the city problems with pirates, prompting the construction of Fort San Juan de Ulúa on the island where Grijalva had landed in the mid-16th century. In 1600, when large-scale smuggling of goods took place to avoid customs officials, the Spanish Crown ordered the settlement returned to its original site to cut down on that traffic. Docks and an observation tower were constructed on the island to ensure that goods went through customs officials. Major public buildings were constructed at the beginning of the 17th century: the municipal palace, the monastery of &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Merced&quot;, and the &quot;Hospital de Nuestra Señora de Loreto&quot;. In 1618, a fire nearly reduced much of the city to ashes. In 1640, the Barlovento Armada was stationed here for additional defense against pirates. The pirates, led by Spain&#x27;s rival nations, Nicholas van Hoorn, Laurens de Graaf and Michel de Grammont attacked Vera Cruz in 1683.

During the 18th century Veracruz&#x27;s defence was improved with the construction of a wall around it (1790), bastions Baluarte de Santiago and gates, and San Juan de Ulua&#x27;s renovation to today&#x27;s appearance. The reason was to protect this valuable port after the threat of an invasion such as the siege of Havana (1762) by the British. The Spanish empire&#x27;s talented military engineers were gathered in Veracruz to work on the New Spanish Gulf of Mexico&#x27;s defence against the attack of Spain&#x27;s enemies in a time when the Spanish Empire stretched from current Venezuela to Florida. Many of the buildings and institutions which form Veracruz&#x27;s Historic Centre date from that time such as the cathedral (1731), the Military Hospital of San Carlos (1731) or modern water supply and sewerage systems. 

In 1804 the Balmis Expedition arrived at Veracruz with the smallpox vaccine, which was from here transported to the whole of New Spain. The 19th century was marked by armed conflicts. During the Mexican War of Independence, Spain placed troops here to maintain Mexico City&#x27;s sea link with Spain. In 1816, Antonio López de Santa Anna commanded royalist troops countering the insurgency. In 1820, insurgents took the city, despite Santa Anna&#x27;s attempts to stop them. The last viceroy of New Spain, Juan O&#x27;Donojú, arrived here in 1821, where he signed the Treaty of Córdoba with Agustín de Iturbide at Fort San Juan de Ulúa. In 1823, Spanish troops remaining at Fort San Juan de Ulúa fired on the newly independent Mexican city of Veracruz. In 1825 the last Spanish troops left San Juan de Ulúa.

===Mexico (since 1821)===

The city&#x27;s defense against the attack earned its first title of &quot;Heroic City&quot;. During the Pastry War in 1837, the city mounted a defense against a French attack, and earned its second title of &quot;Heroic City.&quot;
In 1847 during the Mexican–American War, United States forces invaded the city. It was defended by generals Juan Morales and José Juan de Landero. The siege continued with brisk firing until 27 March, by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wall surrounding the city. Upon this General Morales, who was Governor of both the city and of San Juan de Ulúa, commenced a correspondence with General Winfield Scott looking to the surrender of the town, forts and garrison. On the 29th Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulúa were occupied by Scott&#x27;s army. About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of artillery, in addition to large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the victorious invaders. The casualties on the US side during the siege amounted to sixty-four officers and men, killed and wounded.

Ten years later, civil war between liberals and conservatives forced Benito Juárez&#x27;s government to flee Mexico City. Juárez went to Veracruz and governed from there in 1857. In 1861 Spain sent its troops to occupy the port in an effort to secure payment of debts, which Juárez had suspended. French military forces accompanied them to prepare for Maximiliano I and occupied the city when the emperor and his wife Carlota of Belgium arrived in 1864.

===20th century===

The conflicts and damaged trade relations with Europe took its toll on the port of Veracruz. By 1902, the port facilities had deteriorated, and it was considered one of the most dangerous on the American coast. President Porfirio Díaz contracted with foreign enterprises to modernize the port&#x27;s infrastructure.

Between April and November 1914, during the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), the US attacked and occupied the port in an effort to try to preserve trade in the dispute with President Victoriano Huerta. The city gained its fourth title of &quot;Heroic City&quot;.

After the Revolution, most port workers became unionized. Through most of the 20th century, federal and state legal and political initiatives intended to better workers&#x27; lives had effects on the operations of the port. Eventually, unions came to have great power over the operations and tariffs charged. By the latter part of the 20th century, competing unions made the operations of the port difficult. Some blocked access to the port from federal roads and financial corruption was a problem.

In the 1970s, a federal commission was established to design a new administrative system for the ports of Mexico. The legislature passed laws authorizing the federal government to take control over important ports such as Veracruz. The federal government modernized the port, adopting automation of loading and unloading. This resulted in a reduction of 80% of the port&#x27;s jobs and labor resistance through strikes. The dockworkers&#x27; unions unified, negotiating for members to have a stake in a new company to manage the port&#x27;s functions, named the &quot;Empresa de Servicios Portuarios de Veracruz, S.A. de C.V&quot;. The old &quot;Compañia Terminal de Veracruz&quot; was dissolved in 1988 and the new organization was fully in place by 1991.

===21st century===
In September 2010, Hurricane Karl, a small, strong Category 3 hurricane, caused widespread flooding and damage affecting approximately half a million people. Sixteen were confirmed dead with another eleven missing. Sixty-five municipalities in the state were declared disaster areas. Preliminary damage estimates total up to US$3.9 billion and $50 billion MXN.

==Geography==

As the municipal seat, the city of Veracruz is the governing authority for 128 other named localities during the 2010 census, forming a municipality with a territory of . The population of the municipality is 552,156 inhabitants, of whom 428,323 or approximately 77.6% live in municipality&#x27;s portion of the city proper. The municipality is bordered by the municipalities of La Antigua, Boca del Río, Manlio Fabio Altamirano, Medellín, and Paso de Ovejas, with the Gulf of Mexico to the northeast, and has an average altitude of ten meters above sea level. The area is flat with little in the way of elevations and is crossed by the Medio, Grande and Tonayán Rivers. There are also beaches here such as the Sacrificios and Verde. Its climate is tropical with an average temperature of . Vegetation is mostly of the rainforest type, with many trees losing leaves during the winter dry season. Fauna mostly consists of birds, small mammals and insects.

Much of the land in the municipality outside of the city is used for agriculture and livestock. Principal crops include corn, beans, watermelon, oranges, sorghum, mango, pineapple and sugar cane. Livestock raised includes cattle, pigs, sheep, fowl and horses. There is also some forestry. The municipality contains deposits of marble, lime, cement, sand and clay. In and around the city there are a number of industrial sites producing paints and solvents, food products, plastics, petrochemicals and metals.

Veracruz has many beaches and off coast islands. Controversy has accompanied the clean-up of the island called Isla de Sacrificios, which lies just off the coast of the city and measures 450 meters long and 198 meters wide. The island is part of a system of twenty-three coral reefs called the Veracruz Reef System, which is protected as a national park. Visitors can kayak to the Isla de Sacrificios to observe seagulls, pelicans and the fish that inhabit the coral reef. In 1983, a study and initial cleanup project was undertaken at the island, which collected fifty tons of trash. Shortly thereafter, the island was closed to the public and since then, there has been a struggle among authorities, tour operators and fisherman as to the fate and uses of the island. However, access to the island has been restricted to research, teaching and the occasional sporting event.

Other small islands and shoals off the coast include: Isla de Enmedio, Isla Verde, Anegada de Adentro, Santiaguillo and Anegada de Afuera, the last two next to Antón Lizardo beach. All of them are included within the Sistema Arrecifal Veracruzano national park and make fine sites for SCUBA diving. Several operators in Veracruz and in Boca del Rio offer scuba equipment and tours. The best season for scuba diving is May to August.

The mainland has several beaches. Playa Martí is located between the city of Veracruz and Boca del Río. The Playa de Hornos is located next to the Veracruz Aquarium. There are also boats that take tourist to the Isla Canuncito. Villa del Mar is just south of Playa de Hornos.

===Climate===

Like the majority of the coastal part of the state of Veracruz and southern parts of Tamaulipas, the city of Veracruz has a tropical savanna climate (Koppen: &quot;Aw&quot;). The wet season typically lasts from June to October, when a vast majority of the yearly precipitation falls. Large tropical thunderstorms occur nearly daily in the late afternoon, originating in the moist atmosphere above the Gulf of Mexico. The wet season has slightly hotter temperatures and is more humid than other seasons; the dewpoint can easily exceed . It has fewer foggy days than the dry season (averaging around 4-7 foggy days). 

The dry season of the year spans from November to May, with slightly cooler temperatures and less humid days; making it the much more desirable part of the year for visiting tourists as opposed to the stormy, humid wet season. Despite the dryness, winters are foggy and cloudy, averaging 10-17 overcast days and 11-17 foggy days per month during the dry season. Many tourists visit Veracruz during Christmas and March break, in the midst of the winter&#x27;s comfortably warm dry season.

Veracruz receives an average of of precipitation annually. The wettest month of the year is July with an average monthly total of of rainfall, while the driest month of the year is March with an only of rainfall. Temperature-wise, the hottest months of the year are June and August, both sharing mean temperatures of , while the coolest month of the year is January with a mean temperature of .


==Culture==

Because of its importance as Mexico&#x27;s principal Caribbean and Atlantic sea port, Veracruz has always been a locus for the mixture of different cultures, particularly Spanish, Native Mexican, and African. During the colonial period, African slaves were imported to work in the fields and shipyards. Following Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain in 1821, immigrants from Italy and Cuba settled in the city.

The Veracruz Carnaval has been celebrated every year since 1866, during the empire of Maximilian I. At that time, a request was made to sponsor a &quot;Festival of Masks&quot;, which would consist of dances at the principal social gathering sites of the city such as the main theater. While the events were officially held at these locations, many residents took advantage of the celebration on the streets near these sites. Eventually, the event became based in the historic center of the city and focused on the Carnaval Parade of Veracruz. Today, the event begins with the &quot;Burning of Bad Humor&quot; and ends with the &quot;Burial of Juan Carnaval&quot;. Carnaval here is the largest celebration in the country.

Sugar and rum production have been mainstays as commodities; during colonial times they were produced by slave labor and later, immigrants often entered labor and industrial jobs. Together these ethnic groups have created rich cultures. The Naval Academy attracts both Mexican and international sailors and officers, adding to the cosmopolitan mix of the city. The city has a reputation for being lively, with many people out in the squares listening to music late into the night. In the morning, they frequent sidewalk cafes for their morning coffee. Veracruz has become a popular location for filming. The government has supported the development of filmmaking in the municipality.

===Music===
The song &quot;La Bamba&quot;, made famous by Ritchie Valens, has its roots in the Veracruz &quot;son&quot; style of music, which originated in southern part of the state of Veracruz. It has African and Caribbean influence and is popular throughout Mexico, Latin America and the United States. 

Traditional Veracruzian music is called &quot;Son Jarocho&quot;. Although there are many types of son music found in Mexico, the Son Jarocho is typically associated with the city of Veracruz. Other types of son include &quot;Son Comercial&quot;. This style is faster and flashier than the traditional Son Jarocho and can be heard in Mexican folkdance exhibitions, when Veracruz women with long white dresses and fans dance with partners also dressed in white. The Son Comercial developed in the 1940s from the Son Jarocho; in the 21st century it is so pervasive that many mistakenly believe it to be the first version. The Casa de Cultura has a workshops for traditional music and son singers can be heard just about anytime on the main plaza (Zócalo)

===Cuisine===

Veracruz recipes use corn, beans and squash as staples, a practice dating to the indigenous peoples. Local diets also include indigenous tropical foods such as chili peppers, tomatoes, avocados, pineapples, papaya, mamey, sweet potatoes, peanuts and sapote fruit, all of which have been cultivated since pre-Columbian times. The Spanish introduced the use of herbs such as parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay laurel and coriander, as well as saffron, wheat, rice, almonds, olives/olive oil, garlic and capers. Because of the lengthy colonial period and international port, these ingredients are used more widely here than in other parts of the country.

A signature dish of the area, &quot;Huachinango a la Veracruzana&quot; (red snapper Veracruz-style), uses local fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, chili peppers) and Spanish ingredients (olive oil, garlic and capers). Other popular dishes include , a rice dish baked with a variety of seafood and , a seafood soup reputed to cure hangovers.

Coffeehouses are a center of social life in the city, and the &quot;Gran Café del Portal&quot; and the &quot;Café de la Parroquia&quot; are the two best-known establishments. To request a refill, customers clink the sides of their glasses (not cups) with their spoons. This clinking can be heard from the early morning to late at night. The story behind this custom is that a trolley driver used to ring his bell when he was a block away from the Gran Café del Portal to let the waiters know he was coming. When the driver died, his casket was borne on the trolley and when it passed the establishment, the customers and waiters tapped their glasses in his honor.

===Landmarks===

Veracruz is not as popular a tourist destination as many other resort areas. But the city has been promoting an identity as a tourist destination, emphasizing new attractions such as the Veracruz Aquarium and the City Museum, and the renovation of historic ones, such as Fort San Juan de Ulúa and the Naval Academy.

The cultural center of the city is its main plaza, officially named Plaza de las Armas but commonly called the Zócalo. This tree-shaded square, in which a number of foreign invading armies have camped, is occupied from morning to night with people playing dominos, selling food, cigars, etc. playing music, dancing and other activities. It is more crowded in the evening, when nearly every night the danzón is danced. This dance was brought over to Mexico from Cuba by refugees in the 1870s. It was originally restricted to the lower classes but eventually gained accepted by all levels of society. The danzón is sponsored by several dance schools dedicated to keeping the tradition alive. Around the plaza are numerous shops and restaurants, as well as the municipal palace and the cathedral.

The Municipal Palace was built for the city council in 1608. The building was extensively remodeled in the 18th century. Its architectural style is a sober Baroque with a tower at one of the corners. Lookouts used this tower to keep watch on the ships entering and leaving the port. It has a large courtyard surrounded by wide arches and is the oldest city government building in Mexico.

The Cathedral of Veracruz, named &quot;Catedral de la Virgen de la Asunción&quot;, is also located on the Zócalo. This cathedral was begun in the 17th century and finished in 1731. It was modified in the 19th century but was not designated as a cathedral until 1963. The building has five naves, with an octagonal cupola covered in Puebla tiles. The tower was begun in the early 20th century and has its own small cupola. The main façade is Neoclassic with two levels and a crest. The lower level contains an arched entrance flanked by two Doric columns and the upper level contains the choral window, above which is a medallion. The interior is simple with crystal candelabras.

In the port area are the Pemex Tower, the old lighthouse, which was the seat of government for Venustiano Carranza, and the Crafts Market. On Marina Mercante Street are located the Old Customs Building, the Postal and Telegraph twin buildings, as well as the old railroad terminal. In the 1920s, passenger traffic was such that the station had its own hotel. The Juárez Hemicycle Monument stands in front of the Civil Registry Building, which contains the first birth certificate issued in the country.

The &quot;malecón&quot; (boardwalk) stretches for kilometers along the Gulf of Mexico, leading from the city center into the suburbs. This area is popular at night, when people stroll and exercise, enjoying the ocean breezes. Near the city center, the malecón is crowded with merchants selling knick-knacks, souvenirs, jewelry made with seashells, and T-shirts.

Fort San Juan de Ulúa is located on an island, now connected to land of the same name. The island is part of the La Gallega coral reef and has about 2,500 meters of beach. The full reef covers about 100 hectares and varies in depth between sixty and ninety centimeters, forming a natural break. In the pre-Hispanic era, this island was a sanctuary dedicated to the god Tezcatlipoca. The site where the Spanish first landed has been developed over the centuries and today serves as the container ship terminal of the port. Most of the island is occupied by the fort. This fort was built where the Spanish first landed to conquer Mexico City. They used it for their last defense during and just after the Mexican War of Independence. Between these periods, the fort helped defend the city against piracy and later was used for prisoners and interrogations of the Mexican Inquisition. The fort was begun here in 1582 to protect the city from pirates and was enlarged in 1635 during the period of frequent pirate raids. It was finished in 1707.

After the War of Independence ended in 1821, the Spanish kept control of the island and fort, and occasionally bombarded Mexican forces on land. They finally transferred this area to Mexico in 1825. The fort was used in 1838 during the Pastry War with the French. In 1847, it was used for an unsuccessful defense of the port when United States forces invaded during the Mexican–American War.

In the 19th century, the fort was converted into a military prison. The fort&#x27;s narrow stone passageways lead to a series of dungeons with walls 24-feet thick in some places. Those cells which were darker and hotter were reserved for those charged with more serious crimes. A few of the most dreaded dungeons were nicknamed &quot;Heaven&quot;, &quot;Purgatory&quot; and &quot;Hell&quot;. Some of prison&#x27;s more famous prisoners include Fray Servando Teresa de Mier and Benito Juárez, both political prisoners. But the most famous is Jesús Arriaga, better known as &quot;Chucho el Roto&quot;. Most people visit San Juan de Ulúa out of attraction to the legend of this 19th-century bandit.

Jesús Arriaga, better known as &quot;Chucho el Roto&quot;, was held at Fort San Juan de Ulúa where he died. It is not known whether he died of natural causes, as a result of a fight with other prisoners or by other means. Chucho was a Robin Hood figure who lived during the 19th century. He stole from the rich and gave to the poor, inspiring songs and poetry such as the verses penned by Rafael de Zayas Enríquez. Chucho was arrested in the city of Querétaro after a jewelry store heist. He was sent to the Belén Prison in Mexico City, then to Veracruz. He was also renowned as a seducer of women, especially those who were rich and lonely. Most of his targets were jewelry shops, pawnshops and the homes of the wealthy.

Along with Fort San Juan de Ulúa, the city used to be walled in for protection against pirates and invasions. All that is left of these city walls is the &quot;Baluarte&quot;, a small fortress. The 1635 structure has thick, sturdy walls with cannons directed to cover sea approaches. Inside is a small museum featuring a collection of high-quality pre-Hispanic jewelry discovered in the 1970s by a fisherman.

The Veracruz Aquarium was built in 1992 and is the largest and most important in Latin America. The Freshwater Gallery consists of thirteen exhibitions containing 562,177 liters of water. These exhibitions contain aquatic species from Asia, Africa, South America as well as Mexico. The Reef Tank is best known for its sharks. The Salt Water Gallery contains fourteen tanks with tanks dedicated to the species of Veracruz, the Red Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Another exhibit is devoted to sharks, containing 25 species that swim around visitors as they walk through a glass tunnel built through the tank. There is also an exhibit dedicated entirely to manatees.

The Heroica Escuela Naval (Heroic Naval School) was founded here in 1897 by José María de Vega, then Secretary of the Navy. The school was founded because at the time, Mexico was dependent on the hiring of foreign sailors and foreign training of its officers to staff its Navy; prior attempts to establish an academy had failed. Porfirio Díaz approved the institute to train both Navy and Merchant Marine officers, to be based on similar schools in Western Europe.

The City Museum (Museo de la Ciudad) is located at the intersections of Zaragoza and Esteban Morales streets in the historic center. It is housed in a two-story building which is of neoclassic design built between the mid and latter 19th century. The main façade on Zaragoza Street has an enormous main door with posts, framed by Ionic pilasters, which reach to the upper floor, and topped by a pediment and a cornice. The building was originally constructed as an asylum. When the French invaded Veracruz in 1861, the building was commandeered for other purposes until 1870.

The asylum took it back and operated here for almost 100 years. New facilities were constructed for it south of the city, and the building was renovated for adaptive reuse as a museum. The City Museum was inaugurated in 1970 and contains exhibits relating to the history of Veracruz.

The Agustín Lara House Museum exhibits works, photographs and personal effects of the poet Agustín Lara, located in what was his house in Boca del Río just outside Veracruz. News clips, caricatures and a replica of the radio studio where he hosted &quot;La Hora Azul&quot; (&quot;The Blue Hour&quot;) are among the items on display. Lara was one of the city&#x27;s most famous sons as a popular songwriter and singer in Mexico. He began his career playing the piano in brothels and later became a bullfighter. Lara had seven wives, one of whom was Mexican screen diva María &quot;La Doña&quot; Félix, for whom he wrote the song &quot;María Bonita&quot;. To be a gentleman, when he and Félix were about to break up, he married her to &quot;make an honest woman of her&quot; even though they had lived together for years.

==Economy==
Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant (LVNPP) in nearby Alto Lucero, Veracruz, produces about 4.5% of Mexico&#x27;s electrical energy.

===Port of Veracruz===
The Port of Veracruz is the oldest and largest port in Mexico, deeply important to its history. During the colonial period, it was the most important port in New Spain, the connection to ports and the Atlantic trade creating a large wealthy merchant class, which was more prosperous than that of Mexico City. From the port of Veracruz were exported turkeys, corn, beans, avocados, and cotton to Spain. From Spain came fava beans, wheat, rice, cattle, pigs, fabric, wine and other goods. In the mid 16th century, so much gold and silver was found in Veracruz that these precious metals were the chief export to Spain on what were called treasure ships commonly known as Spanish treasure fleet. The bounty attracted pirates, mostly from Britain and Holland, such as Francis Drake and John Hawkins, who preyed on such ships. Veracruz was invaded during conflicts with France and the United States.
In the latter half of the 19th century, Veracruz&#x27;s importance waned as trade to Europe diminished. The port was refurbished at the beginning of the 20th century, but petroleum production was the primary income for the state rather than the port. This began to change in the latter half of the 20th century, and the port has surged back to the state&#x27;s economic forefront.

In 1991, the federal government took over the port of Veracruz to correct the handling of merchandise. Later that same year, the first private shipping companies began operations. In 1993, the Law of Ports was passed regularizing the operations of ports in the country. This law created the Administración Portuaria de Veracruz (Port Authority of Veracruz).

In the 2000s, the port continues to handle all kinds of cargo, moving 16.1 million tons of products in 2004. This figure is expected to rise once modernization efforts have finished, especially a truck bypass that leads directly from the highway to the port. Veracruz is the gateway for Mexico&#x27;s automobile industry, which is concentrated in the center of the country, in the states around Mexico City. This port has several advantages. It is the first to be equipped specifically for shipping automobiles. Located on the south-central coast, Veracruz is closer to car manufacturers and has better access to both import and export markets in the U.S., Europe, Central and South America than other Mexican ports. In 2004, the port handled 70% of the automobiles exported. With traffic expected to rise, the port authorities unveiled a program to enlarge the port&#x27;s infrastructure and expand operations by 2010. However conversion of port area for tourism challenges operations. The port handles 700,000 to 800,000 vehicles per year; the largest volume on the continent.

==Education==

The Universidad Veracruzana was established in 1944. It was created by joining a number of professional and higher education establishments together. It is now the main center of higher education in the state of Veracruz, with five campuses and twenty-two satellite locations in the state. The student population is approximately 70,000, offering degrees in sixty different fields.

Private universities include Cristóbal Colón University, mainly dedicated to architecture and administration . UNIMEX was founded in 1991 and focuses on marketing, graphic design and law.

The Veracruz Institute of Technology was founded in 1946 by Ismael Lagunes Lastra. It started out as the School of Arts and Letters, with a mission to train students for the jobs associated with the developing port and industrial base of the city. It started teaching students at the secondary and high school level, later adding bachelor&#x27;s degree programs. In 1952, the school received a grant of lands by the federal and state governments to expand. Technical programs were added in the 1960s and have become the main part of the school&#x27;s work, Veracruz Institute of Technology is famous due to its bachelor of engineering in biochemical engineering, masters and PhD about food science and biochemical engineering.

The Ilustre Instituto Veracruzano (&quot;Illustrious Veracruzan Institute&quot;) was founded in 1853.

==Transportation==

Veracruz International Airport serves the city with daily service to Mexico City as well as international service to Houston only. The commercial passenger airlines to currently serve VER airport are Aeroméxico, United Airlines, American Airlines, Viva, Volaris and Aerus. In 2023, the airport handled 1,665,694 passengers.

Non-passenger rail transport (Kansas City Southern de México) connects Veracruz with Mexico City and state capital of Xalapa.

Veracruz is linked to Mexico City by a four-lane toll highway which also passes through Córdoba and Puebla. Halfway between Veracruz and Córdoba, it is connected to the La Tinaja-Cosoleacaque toll highway which goes as far as Villahermosa, Tabasco. Another toll highway goes to Xalapa.

Urban transport formerly was provided by the Veracruz tram system, from 1908 to 1981. Now the city has buses, including trolley-replica tour buses that looks like former trams and highlighted at evening.

<doc id="652400" wikidata="Q6763986" url="?curid=652400" title="Marine Academy of Science and Technology">
<text>The Marine Academy of Science and Technology (MAST) is a coeducational four-year magnet public high school located in the Sandy Hook section of Middletown Township, in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, serving students in ninth through twelfth grade. The school offers learning in all subjects, specializing in marine science and technology. It is one of five career academies administered by the Monmouth County Vocational School District (MCVSD). MAST requires each student to participate in the Naval Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (NJROTC) every year as well as an Annual Military Inspection (AMI) in the spring or fall. The school&#x27;s curriculum focuses on marine sciences and marine technology/engineering. The school offers small classes with close personal attention.

As of the 2023–24 school year, the school had an enrollment of 273 students and 27.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.1:1. There were 4 students (1.5% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 1 (0.4% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

The school is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools. The Marine Academy is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology. For the 1997–98 and 2013 school years, the Marine Academy was designated a Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education. MAST was selected by the Department of Education as a New American High School for the 1998–99 school year; among the many honors and awards the innovative program has received throughout its years. On April 15, 2007, in honor of the Marine Academy&#x27;s 25th Anniversary, a proclamation by the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders declared April 15 as &quot;Marine Academy of Science and Technology Day&quot; in Monmouth County.

==History==
Marine Academy was founded in 1981 as a part-time program which served an inaugural class of 53 students who attended their home high school in the mornings and took 2 hours of classes at MAST in the afternoon. The school has since become a full-time diploma-granting program.

==Location and campus==
MAST campus is located in the Fort Hancock Historic Area, as part of the Sandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The school is adjacent to the Sandy Hook Lighthouse, the oldest operating lighthouse in the country, and is within walking distance of several beaches. The campus includes 13 newly renovated buildings and various laboratories devoted to marine biology, marine chemistry, oceanography, C.A.D., and multi-media. The buildings were previously mess halls and latrines for the &quot;Tent City&quot; that was set up at Fort Hancock for a time during World War II. A Technology Workshop, a Media Center containing a Computer Classroom, a Naval Science Building, a state of the art wet lab in the James J. Howard Marine Science laboratory, and other classrooms round out the facilities. There is also hands-on instruction on the school research vessel, the &quot;R/V Blue Sea&quot; for underclassmen and some seniors. The &quot;R/V Blue Sea&quot; is currently berthed at the Coast Guard Station on Sandy Hook. This vessel is extensively used throughout many core classes in the curriculum including marine biology, marine chemistry, marine physics, and oceanography.

In the wake of significant damage to the Sandy Hook campus following Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the MAST campus was temporarily relocated to St. Joseph&#x27;s School in Keyport, in addition to the use of lab space at Brookdale Community College. As of September 9, 2013, MAST relocated back to its Sandy Hook campus.

== NJROTC ==
All students at the Marine Academy participate in the Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC). The unit is designated as an Area 2 school and participates in many inter-unit competitions, the most prominent of which is the Drill Team. Cadets can participate in several disciplines including Freshmen, Color Guard, Armed Platoon, Unarmed Platoon, Unarmed Exhibition, and Armed Exhibition. In the past, MAST has been successful at several area competitions, including Neptune, Linden, and Areas. Exceptional performance in the Area 4 Drill Competition (placing first in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012) has qualified the school for national competition in Pensacola, Florida for those years. In 2016,the MAST Drill Team attended Navy Nationals once again in Pensacola, Florida, their first time back since 2012.

Each year, cadets take a physical fitness test (PFT). The standards for this exam are based upon Navy guidelines. Grades range from &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; to &quot;outstanding&quot;, and the result forms a part of the Naval Science grade for credit. Satisfactory PFT performance is a criterion for advancement and promotion.

At the end of each year, qualified cadets are promoted to a rank and billet commensurate with academic performance, ability, and PFT results. The MAST unit is organized into a battalion with four companies and a headquarters section. The highest rank a cadet can achieve is Cadet Commander.
