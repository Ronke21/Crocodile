==Interpretation of easternmost and westernmost==
There are three methods for reckoning the eastern and western extremes of the United States.

One method is to use the Prime Meridian as the dividing line between east and west. This meridian running through Greenwich, London, is defined as zero degrees longitude and could be called the &quot;least eastern&quot; and &quot;least western&quot; place in the world. The 180th meridian, on the opposite side of the globe, is therefore the &quot;easternmost&quot; and &quot;westernmost&quot; place in the world.

Another method is to use the International Date Line as the easternmost–westernmost extreme. On the equinox, the easternmost place would be where the day first begins, and the westernmost is where the day last ends.

Still another method is to first determine the geographic center of the country and from there measure the shortest distance to every other point. All U.S. territory is spread across less than 180° of longitude, so from any spot in the U.S. it is more direct to reach the easternmost point, Point Udall, U.S. Virgin Islands, by traveling east than by traveling west. Likewise, there is not a single point in U.S. territory from which heading east is a shorter route to the westernmost point, Point Udall, Guam, than heading west would be, even accounting for circumpolar routes. The two different Point Udalls are named for two different men: Mo Udall (Guam) and Stewart Udall (Virgin Islands), brothers from the Udall family of Arizona who both served as U.S. Congressmen.

<doc id="635553" wikidata="Q392125" url="?curid=635553" title="Tokyo Mew Mew">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a Japanese manga series created and written by Reiko Yoshida and illustrated by Mia Ikumi. It was originally serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazine &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from September 2000 to February 2003, with its chapters collected in seven &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kodansha. It focuses on five girls infused with the DNA of endangered animals which gives them special powers and allows them to transform into &quot;Mew Mews&quot;. Led by Ichigo Momomiya, the girls protect Earth from aliens who wish to &quot;reclaim&quot; it.

The series was adapted into a fifty-two episode anime series produced by TV Aichi, We&#x27;ve Inc. &amp; Tokyu Agency and animated by Pierrot. The anime aired in Japan from April 6, 2002, to March 29, 2003 on TXN affiliates. A two-volume sequel to the manga, &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode&quot;, was serialized in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from April 2003 to February 2004. The sequel introduces a new character, Berry Shirayuki, who becomes the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. The series would inspire two video games: a puzzle adventure game for Game Boy Advance, and a role-playing video game for the PlayStation.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Tokyopop originally licensed &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; for English-language publication in North America, and would release both the original series and &quot;à la Mode&quot;. Kodansha Comics would publish a newly translated version of the manga in September 2011. 4Kids Entertainment licensed the anime series for North American broadcast under the title Mew Mew Power, and produced an edited English-language localization. The first twenty-three episodes of the series would air on 4Kids TV in the United States, with three additional episodes airing on YTV in Canada. 4Kids was unable to license the remaining 26 episodes of the series or release the series on home video.

&quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; was well received by English-language readers, with critics praising the manga for being a &quot;cute and entertaining&quot; series with &quot;free-flowing style and character designs&quot;. Several volumes of the manga series appeared in the Top 50 sales lists for graphic novels in their respective months of release. The anime series received high ratings in Japan, while &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot; would become 4Kids&#x27; highest-rated show during its American broadcast, and be licensed for regional release in several other countries.

In 2020, a second, two-chapter sequel called &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew 2020 Re-Turn&quot; was released, featuring the main characters with updated designs; and as well as a spinoff, titled &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew Olé!&quot;, which features a new team of male Mew Mews. In addition, a new anime adaptation of the series, &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew New&quot;, was announced; the series aired from July to September 2022. A second season premiered in April 2023.

==Plot==

In Tokyo, Japan, a young girl named Ichigo Momomiya attends an endangered species exhibit with her &quot;crush&quot; Masaya Aoyama. After an earthquake, Ichigo and four other girls are bathed in a strange light. A cat appears before Ichigo, then merges with her. The next day, she begins acting like a cat and making cat puns. After meeting Ryou Shirogane and Keiichirou Akasaka, Ichigo learns that she was infused with the DNA of the Iriomote cat. Ryou and Keiichirou explain that this allows her to transform into Mew Ichigo, a powerful heroic cat girl. She is ordered to defeat Chimera Animas—alien parasites which infect animals and turn them into monsters. Ryou and Keiichirou instruct Ichigo to find the four other girls from the exhibit—the remaining Mew Mews.

The first Mew Mew Ichigo encounters are Minto Aizawa, a spoiled, wealthy girl and ballerina who is infused with the genes of the blue lorikeet; Retasu Midorikawa, a shy but smart girl who endures constant bullying from three girls and absorbs the genes of the finless porpoise; a hyper and yet young girl named Bu-Ling Huang who receives the genes of the golden lion tamarin; and Zakuro Fujiwara, a professional actress and model infused with the genes of the gray wolf.

The five Mew Mews battle the Chimera Animas and their alien controllers Quiche, Pie and Tart. Quiche falls in love with Ichigo where he tries to gain her love despite the fact that he is trying to eliminate the other Mew Mews. Pie and Tart later join Quiche in trying to destroy the Mew Mews.

As the fighting intensifies, the Mew Mews are tasked with finding &quot;Mew Aqua&quot;, a material created from pure water that contains immense power for combating the alien attacks and can be sensed by the Mew Mews. During a battle with Quiche at an aquarium, Ichigo is in danger of losing when the mysterious Blue Knight appears and rescues her. He returns periodically throughout the series, protecting Ichigo from various dangers. It is later revealed that the Blue Knight is in fact Masaya. Shortly after this discovery, Masaya collapses and transforms again. This time, he transforms into Deep Blue, the alien leader who wants to destroy humanity. After explaining to Ichigo that Masaya was a false form for temporary use, Deep Blue attacks the Mew Mews. Pie and Tart try to stop the other mew mews while Ichigo goes after Deep Blue. He and Quiche battle and Deep Blue wins.

Masaya&#x27;s personality briefly reappears and he uses the Mew Aqua inside Deep Blue to save Ichigo and Tokyo, killing himself in the process. Devastated over his loss, Ichigo pours her power into Masaya to save his life, losing her own in the process. Masaya kisses her, changing her back to a human and revives her. Ryou gives Pie the remaining Mew Aqua to save the aliens&#x27; world, after which Quiche, Pie, and Tart say their goodbyes and return to their own world.

===Sequels===
====&quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode&quot;====
Ichigo and Masaya move to England to study endangered species. The remaining Mew Mews continue to eliminate the Chimera Animas left behind by the aliens. They face a new threat in the form of the Saint Rose Crusaders: Humans with supernatural abilities who desire to conquer the world and create a &quot;utopia&quot; while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas. 

Berry Shirayuki becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo&#x27;s place as the leader. Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two endangered species, the Andean mountain cat and the Amami rabbit. As one of the strongest Mew Mews, Berry is targeted by two of the Crusaders, who attack her at school. Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle. For their final attack, two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo and set them against the Mew Mews. Berry and her childhood friend Tasuku Meguro use their newfound feelings of love to reverse the hypnosis and cause a change of heart in the Crusaders.

====&quot;Tokyo Mew Mew Olé!&quot;====
This spin-off follows five high school boys, Aoi Shibuya, Shizuka Yoyogi, Ryusei Kanda, Taichi Hiroo, and Ayato Roppongi, as they protect Tokyo by transforming into Mew Mews alongside female lead, Anzu Hinata.

==Production==
Mia Ikumi spent a year designing the &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; manga before the release of the first volume in February 2001. The story she originally presented to her editors, &quot;Tokyo Black Cat Girl&quot;, featured a heroine named Hime Azumi. An intergalactic police officer named Masha gave her the ability to transform into a cat-girl and asked her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Bugs. After the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series.

As &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; became a viable project, Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida to be the series&#x27; scenario writer and story supervisor. Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume&#x27;s plot, created a scenario by adding stage directions and dialogue, and presented it to Ikumi. Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the manuscript&#x27;s first draft, which was taken to the publishers for final review and approval. This differs from most manga series, in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval.

After the first volume&#x27;s release, a two-day &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; festival was held during the Golden Week holiday—a week-long span in late April and early May during which four public holidays occur—to promote the series. Events included a &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; art gallery and the release of new merchandise. Ikumi, the series&#x27; artist, created a special poster for the event, featuring all twelve characters. She also cosplayed as characters from the series, as Minto Aizawa on one day and Retasu Midorikawa on the other.

==Media==

===Manga===

Written by Reiko Yoshida and illustrated by Mia Ikumi, &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; was first serialized in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; magazine between September 2000 and February 2003. The twenty-nine chapters were then compiled into seven &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kodansha. The first volume was released on February 1, 2001, with the final volume released April 4, 2003. In April 2003, a sequel called &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode&quot; premiered in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;. Running until February 2004 and written solely by Mia Ikumi, the sequel was published as two volumes. In December 2019, an additional spinoff called &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew Olé!&quot; made by Madoka Seizuki began running in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;. The spinoff focuses on a new team of male Mew Mews. The manga ended in August 2022, and was compiled into seven volumes. A short, 2-chapter manga sequel of the original series made by the original creators titled &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew 2020 Re-Turn&quot; was published between December 2019 and January 2020. It was Ikumi&#x27;s final manga before her death in March 2022.

&quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode&quot; are licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop. The first volume of the main series was released on June 1, 2004, with volumes released subsequently until the seventh volume was published on December 15, 2005. The two volumes of &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode&quot; were released on June 7 and September 13, 2005, respectively. Unlike the Japanese releases, each Tokyopop chapter is named. The main series is licensed for an English language release in Singapore by Chuang Yi. Carlsen Comics has licensed the series, through its regional divisions, and released the series in German, Danish and Swedish. The series is also licensed for regional language releases in French by Pika Édition, in Polish by Japonica Polonica Fantastica, and in Finnish by Sangatsu Manga. &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; was one of the first manga series released in Spanish in North America by Public Square Books. Kodansha Comics released an omnibus version of the series, featuring a new translation in September 2011.

===Anime===

Pierrot, TV Aichi, Tokyu Agency and We&#x27;ve Inc. adapted &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; into a fifty-two episode anime series, directed by Noriyuki Abe. Broadcast on TXN affiliates, the series premiered on April 6, 2002, and aired weekly until its conclusion on March 29, 2003. Most of the music for the series was produced by Shin Yoshimura and composed by Takayuki Negishi. Two pieces of theme music were also used for the anime series. &quot;My Sweet Heart&quot;, performed by Rika Komatsu, was the series opening theme. The ending theme &quot;Koi wa A La Mode&quot; is performed by the five voice actors who play the Mew Mews. In Japan, the series was released across nine Region 2 DVD volumes. The ninth volume included a bonus DVD containing extra content. At some point during the TV broadcast, AEON changed its name to We&#x27;ve.

&quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; was later licensed for an English-language dubbed release by 4Kids Entertainment. In its announcement about the series, 4Kids originally noted that the show would be renamed to &quot;Hollywood Mew Mew&quot; and that they would be heavily editing and localizing episodes so that viewers would not recognize its Japanese origins. Subsequent 4Kids press releases about the series referred to the new series as &quot;The Mew Mews&quot; and its original name &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot;. When the series premiered on 4Kids TV on February 19, 2005, it aired under the name as &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot;. Characters and episodes were renamed, scenes were cut and storylines were modified. The music was replaced with a new score provided by &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; and &quot;The Book of Pooh&quot; composer, Julian Harris, and the opening theme was replaced with the song &quot;Team Up&quot;, performed by Bree Sharp and Mollie Weaver. Twenty-six episodes of &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot; aired on 4Kids TV in the United States because 4Kids was unable to get a merchandising deal for the series and the English dub had stopped production. The 4Kids episodes aired on YTV in Canada and on the Pop Girl satellite television channel in the United Kingdom; these included three dubbed episodes not broadcast in the United States.

Although &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot; has not been released to home video in North America, ten of the 4Kids episodes have been released to Region 4 DVD in Australia and New Zealand by Magna Pacific and all twenty-six 4Kids episodes were released to Region 2 DVD in South Africa. &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot; was licensed for regional airing in French by Arès Films, which released nine dubbed 4Kids episodes to DVD in February 2006 as a single volume through Warner Home Vidéo France. The French dub aired on Télétoon as part of their Code F block. The company also licensed the remaining twenty-six episodes of the series that 4Kids had not obtained, releasing them in two DVD box sets through AK Vidéo.

A new anime adaptation titled &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew New&quot; was announced to commemorate the manga&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It was later revealed that the adaptation will be animated by Yumeta Company and Graphinica, and directed by Takahiro Natori, with Yuka Yamada handling the series&#x27; scripts, Satoshi Ishino designing the characters, and Yasuharu Takanashi composing the music. New cast members were chosen to play the Mew Mews through a public audition held in Q2 2020, and they will also be promoting as an idol group named Smewthie as their characters. The new series premiered on July 6, 2022, on TV Tokyo. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the series outside of Asia and was streamed on Hidive.

A second season of &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew New&quot; was announced at the end of the final episode on September 21, 2022. It premiered in April 2023.

===Video games===
Two video games based on the &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; series were launched in 2002 by Takara. The first, , a puzzle adventure game for the Game Boy Advance, was released in Japan on July 11, 2002.

The second title, , was released in Japan on December 5, 2002. It is a PlayStation turn-based role-playing video game in which the player controls a new Mew Mew, , as well as the original five heroines. They must defend Ringo&#x27;s island from Quiche, the Chimera Animas and a new alien named . Both Ringo Akai and Gateau were created by the manga&#x27;s artist, Mia Ikumi, following design specifications from Takara. The game uses voice actors from the anime series, with the two new characters voiced by Taeko Kawata and Ryōtarō Okiayu, respectively. Ikumi was pleased with how both characters turned out and expressed a desire to use Ringo as a regular character in a future manga series. Ringo later joined the other Mew Mews in the &quot;Petite Mew Mew&quot; bonus story in the second volume of &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode&quot;.

===CDs===
Multiple music and character CDs have been released for the &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew series&quot; by King Records. The first, a CD single, contained the full and karaoke versions of &quot;Koi wa A La Mode&quot;, performed by the five voice actors who played the Mew Mews, and a second song performed by Saki Nakajima, who voices Ichigo.

On July 24, 2002, a five-disc limited edition collector&#x27;s box set was released containing character songs for each of the Mew Mews, performed by their respective voice actors and a remix of &quot;Koi wa A La Mode&quot;. The individual character song discs were released as standalone CDs on September 4, 2002. An additional character CD set, containing remixed versions of two songs from each individual album, followed on December 25, 2002. A second character CD for Ichigo, containing five new tracks performed by Nakajima, was released on February 26, 2003.

The first full anime soundtrack, &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew Original Soundtrack&quot; was released on September 25, 2002, by NEC. The CD included the series opening and ending themes and twenty-seven pieces of series background music. NEC released a second soundtrack on January 22, 2003; it contains the opening and closing themes, along with an additional twenty-nine tracks of background music. On March 26, 2003, two &quot;best of&quot; CDs were released for the anime series: &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew Super Best Hit – Cafe Mew Mew side&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew Super Best Hit – Tokyo Mew Mew side&quot;. Each CD includes ten of the series&#x27; &quot;most popular&quot; musical pieces.

==Reception==
The &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; manga series was well received by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, the first volume sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume at the low end of the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, with most of the series released, it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop. It was ranked 16th on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the &quot;ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga&quot;, based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode&quot; debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of &quot;à la Mode&quot; saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot; show appearing on 4Kids TV.

&quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; was generally well received by reviewers, who described it as cute and entertaining. Though &quot;AnimeFringe&quot; Patrick King notes that it is not a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points, he lauded it as engrossing &quot;brain candy&quot; and an &quot;endearing action-romance&quot; that has no &quot;delusions of grandeur&quot;. Critics praised the artwork in both &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; and the sequel &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode&quot;. Ikumi&#x27;s &quot;free flowing&quot; style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series. Criticism of Ikumi&#x27;s art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers. Patrick King of &quot;Animefringe&quot; stated: &quot;one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi&#x27;s ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that&#x27;s hard to resist.&quot; According to Carlo Santos of &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, &quot;Mia Ikumi&#x27;s artwork is perfectly suited to the story, and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other &quot;shōjo&quot; material. Like many budding manga artist, Ikumi&#x27;s greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits, and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds.&quot;

Over all &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode&quot; had more mixed reviews. Critics praised it for being a modern manga that typifies the magical girl formula, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses. Mike Dungan, of Mania Entertainment, considered the original series to be &quot;quite charming&quot; and felt that &quot;à la Mode&quot; was a good continuation of the series with the &quot;same fun and excitement&quot; as its predecessor. Others felt Berry was an overly shallow heroine and that the sequel offered nothing new for readers with the Saint Rose Crusaders&#x27; costumes and plans being nothing more than concepts borrowed from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. Janet Crocker, Shannon Fay and Chris Istel of &quot;Animefringe&quot; criticized &quot;à la Mode&quot; for having the character Duke, the main villain of the arc, dressed in a white robe similar to those used by the white supremacy group, the Ku Klux Klan. Garrity felt &quot;à La Mode&quot; was a vehicle for referencing &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; fandom and merchandise and that Berry was a &quot;transparent wish-fulfillment protagonist&quot;.

The anime adaptation has been compared to &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Yes! PreCure 5&quot; due to both having female protagonists, five original team members with signature colors and powers, and similar plot lines, as have many magical girl series. &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot; received high ratings in Japan with extensive merchandizing tie ins and marketing events to promote the series. The announcement of 4Kids licensing the anime series drew negative reactions from English-speaking in the U.S. fans, due to 4Kids&#x27; practice of removing cultural elements from their English-dubbed adaptations. Several fans would campaign to have the company to release an uncut version of the anime series. Overall viewer reception to &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot; would be mixed, but the show would become the block&#x27;s highest-rated program at the start of the Fall 2005 season. Despite this, the series was never released to DVD in North America. &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot; would be licensed for broadcast in France, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Brazil, Albania, Serbia, Croatia, Turkey, Greece, South Africa, Denmark, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Israel.

<doc id="635561" wikidata="Q3853190" url="?curid=635561" title="Mayer Amschel de Rothschild">
<text>Baron Mayer Amschel de Rothschild (29 June 1818 – 6 February 1874) was an English businessman and politician of the English branch of the Rothschild family. He was the fourth and youngest son of Hannah (Barent-Cohen) and Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836). He was named Mayer Amschel Rothschild, for his grandfather, the patriarch of the Rothschild family.

==Life==

Known to his family as &quot;Muffy&quot;, he was born in New Court, London. After studying at the University of Leipzig and Heidelberg University he became the first member of his family to receive an education at an English university, spending time at both Magdalene and Trinity College, Cambridge. Although apprenticed in the family&#x27;s various banking houses in Europe, he never became a major part of the banking empire. He became High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1847, and was elected Liberal MP for Hythe in 1859. In 1847 he served on the committee of the British Relief Association.

Mayer&#x27;s mother, Hannah ( Barent-Cohen) began the Rothschild acquisitions in Buckinghamshire. Thinking her sons unhealthy, she began to purchase parcels of land around Aylesbury in prime hunting country, where they could take outdoor exercise. By the middle of the 19th century, two of her four sons had large estates and mansions in the Vale of Aylesbury: Anthony Nathan de Rothschild at Aston Clinton; and Mayer at Mentmore. Mayer built Mentmore Towers, the most sumptuous of the English Rothschild houses at the time. Twenty years later, two of his nephews were to follow: Ferdinand James von Rothschild at Waddesdon and Alfred de Rothschild at Halton. Mayer’s brother, Lionel de Rothschild bought another nearby estate at Tring, which he gave as a belated wedding present to his son, Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild.

In 1873, Baron Mayer bought 90 acres (36 hectares) of land at Ascott, two miles from Mentmore. This was given to his nephew Leopold de Rothschild who enlarged the existing Ascott House to the Neo-Tudor structure seen today.

Mayer Rothschild was a keen horseback rider and hunter, in spite of his weight of (just over 15 stones), and was a fan of thoroughbred horse racing. He established a stud farm at Crafton, Buckinghamshire, and was a member of the Jockey Club. In 1871, his horses won four of the five &quot;classic&quot; races: Favonius won The Derby and &quot;Hannah&quot; won The Oaks, the 1,000 Guineas and the St. Leger Stakes.

==Family==
Mayer de Rothschild and his wife Juliana (&quot;née&quot; Cohen) had one child, a daughter, Hannah, later Countess of Rosebery. She was his sole heiress, and through her, Mentmore Towers passed to the Earl of Rosebery, who served as Prime Minister from 1894 to 1895.

Mayer Amschel de Rothschild died in 1874 and was buried in the Willesden Jewish Cemetery in Beaconsfield Road, Willesden, London.

<text>The University of Nigeria, commonly referred to as UNN, is a federal and public research university located in Nsukka, Enugu State, Eastern part of Nigeria. Founded in 1955 by Nnamdi Azikiwe who was the Governor General of Nigeria between 1960 and 1963, and first President of Nigeria between 1963 and 1966. The University of Nigeria Nsukka was formally opened on 7 October 1960, as one of the first generation universities in Nigeria and is ranked among the top universities in Nigeria and Africa. The University of Nigeria has three campuses in Enugu State–Nsukka, Enugu, and Ituku-Ozalla – and the Aba campus in Abia State.

The University of Nigeria is the first full-fledged indigenous and first autonomous university in Nigeria, modelled upon the American educational system. It was the first land-grant university in Africa and one of the five most reputed universities in Nigeria. The university has 15 Faculties and 102 academic departments. The university offers 108 undergraduate programs and 211 postgraduate programmes.

Through its vast network of graduates, the University of Nigeria has made a substantial contribution to the political, industrial, economic, and cultural growth of Nigeria, Africa, and the world at large.

==History==
A law to establish a university in the Eastern Region of Nigeria was passed on 18 May 1955. Advice was sought from educationists in the UK and the US to help in the planning of the physical and educational aspects of the proposed university.

Under the joint auspices of the Inter-University Council for Higher Education and Overseas and the International Co-operation Administration (now the Uni\ted States Agency for International Development), J.W. Cook, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Exeter, Dr John A. Hannah, President of Michigan State University and Dr. Glen L. Taggart, Dean of International Programs at the same university, came to Nigeria in 1958. The team surveyed the site at Nsukka and extensively investigated a great variety of factors pertinent to the establishment of a new university.

The results of their efforts were contained in a white paper issued by the Eastern Nigeria Government on 30 November 1958. They had recommended, &quot;that the development of the University of Nigeria based upon the concept of service to problems and needs of Nigeria, is a desirable project and one that should receive support from any source which could help to make it a sound endeavour&quot;.

They further recommended that a provisional council be established to &quot;draw upon the technical and consultative resources available throughout the world for help in planning the institution&quot;.

The provisional council, authorized by the Eastern Nigeria Legislature, was appointed by the Governor in Council in April 1959, and given the necessary financial and administrative powers to build a sound university. It reflected the spirit of international co-operation which has given birth to the institution. It consisted of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, chairman, Dr T. Olawale Elias and Dr Okechukwu Ikejiani from the Federation of Nigeria, J. S. Fulton from the United Kingdom, Dr. Marguerite Cartwright and Dr. Eldon Lee Johnson from the United States. The university was formally opened on 7 October 1960, as the climax to the Nigerian independence celebrations in the country&#x27;s Eastern Region, by Princess Alexandra of Kent. Classes began on 17 October 1960 with an enrollment of 220 students and 13 members of the academic staff. The opening convocation addresses were delivered by the Chairman of the Provisional Council, Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of the Federation of Nigeria, and by John A. Hannah, president of Michigan State University.

The university was fully autonomous, with the power to grant its own degrees. Technically speaking, therefore, it became the first fully-fledged university in Nigeria, since Ibadan was still at that time a university college granting London degrees. It also became the first university established by a Nigerian Regional Government. The University College Ibadan, the oldest degree-awarding institution, cut its umbilical cord with London in January 1963, becoming the University of Ibadan. In July 1967, it turned out the first graduates holding Ibadan (rather than London) degrees, by which time Nsukka had produced two crops of graduates and taken all the publicity for turning out the first graduates of an autonomous Nigerian university.

==Campuses of University of Nigeria==

The university has four campuses:
* University of Nigeria, Nsukka, UNN,
* University of Nigeria Enugu campus, UNEC.
* University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, UNTH - Ituku-Ozalla
* University of Nigeria Aba campus, UNAC Aba.

The main campus of the university is located on 871 hectares of hilly savannah in the town of Nsukka, about eighty kilometres north of Enugu, and enjoys a very pleasant and healthy climate. Additionally 209 hectares of arable land are available for an experimental agricultural farm and 207 hectares for staff housing development. There is regular road transport between Nsukka and Enugu, and Nsukka is also quite easily accessible from all parts of Nigeria. There are modern shopping facilities and a large market in Nsukka town.

The Nsukka campus houses the Faculties of Agriculture, Arts, Biological Sciences, Education, Engineering, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine.

The former Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, Enugu, was incorporated into the university in 1961, and its buildings now form the Enugu Campus (200 hectares) of the university located in the heart of Enugu, the administrative capital of Enugu State of Nigeria. Enugu is a modern city, accessible by air, rail and road. The Faculties of Business Administration, Environmental Studies, Law and Health Sciences are located at the Enugu Campus.
The teaching hospital (UNTH) attached to the university is presently sited at Ituku-Ozalla (25 kilometres south of Enugu) on a site. It also hosts the Faculty of Dentistry/Dental Surgery and Medical Sciences.

The Aba campus (UNAC) hosts the National Institute for Nigerian Languages.

A former campus was opened in October 1973 in Calabar, Cross River State. The campus at Calabar became a full-fledged University of Calabar in October 1975.

The official name of the university is the University of Nigeria and the official acronym of the name UNN. &quot;UN&quot; stands for University of Nigeria while the last &quot;N&quot; stands for Nsukka. This acronym is also shared by the main campus of the university, Nsukka (University of Nigeria, Nsukka). Thus technically, the name University of Nigeria, Nsukka refers to the main campus at Nsukka only while the name University of Nigeria refers to all the campuses of the university. References may be made to the location of the other campuses by mentioning the names of the cities where they are situated rather than a blanket description with the name Nsukka. Students at the Enugu Campus prefer to write the name of their school as University of Nigeria Enugu Campus (UNEC) if they must add the location of their school. Students from other campuses of the school also prefer same. Official documents of the school describes the school as simply University of Nigeria. They also make this dichotomy when referring to different campuses of the school.

He worked in the faculty of arts with critic and African literature scholar Donatus Nwoga. Astrophysicist Sam Okoye founded the Space Research Center in 1972. The Centre for Basic Space Research remains one of the few institutions in Africa that carries out research and offers courses in astronomy at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

The first open heart surgical operation in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa was undertaken in 1974 at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu. The team was led by visiting Magdi Yacoub from the UK and others in the team included Professors Fabian Udekwu and Anyanwu. The College of Medicine has since evolved into the centre for cardiothoracic surgery and tropical cardiology excellence for the West Africa region with the siting of the National Cardiothoracic Center at UNTH Enugu. Much medical research is also being carried out in the college.

The Department of Fine and Applied Arts is known for the Nsukka group – seven artists associated with a system of traditional Igbo designs and styles known as &quot;uli&quot;.

The Law Faculty of the university is the oldest in Nigeria; it was established in 1960.

The Department of Electronic Engineering was named a Center of Excellence in Electronics by the Federal Government of Nigeria in 1982. The department was established in 1981 under the faculty of engineering after the previous department of electronic engineering was split into two separate department. The department offers a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronic Engineering to undergraduates, as well a MSC and Doctoral degree program in relevant specializations under Electronic Engineering. The Department has produced the highest number of first-class graduate than any other department in the university.

The University of Nigeria, Nsukka Libraries consist of the Nnamdi Azikiwe Library, the Enugu Campus Main Library and the Medical Library located at the College of Medicine, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Ituku-Ozalla. On 8 March 2009, the multi-complex Nnamdi Azikiwe Library of University of Nigeria, Nsukka was officially opened by the then minister of Education, Dr Sam Egwu. The library has embraced information technology to provide an effective library service to users and this was why it was one of the three leading academic libraries in Nigeria where TINLIB software was introduced in the 90s After so many failed attempts to automate the library using a well robust integrated library management software, the library finally settled for KOHA Integrated library management software to automate its activities.

It has a total holding of 350,000 book titles and about 5000 serials titles.

<doc id="635563" wikidata="Q7281149" url="?curid=635563" title="Radio ballad">
<text>The radio ballad is an audio documentary format created by Ewan MacColl, Peggy Seeger, and Charles Parker in 1958. It combines four elements of sound: songs, instrumental music, sound effects, and, most importantly, the recorded voices of those who are the subjects of the documentary. The latter element was revolutionary; previous radio documentaries had used either professional voice actors or prepared scripts.

==Original radio ballads==
The original radio ballads were recorded for the BBC. MacColl wrote a variety of songs especially for them, many of which have become folk classics. The trio together made eight radio ballads between 1958 and 1964. They were: 

# &quot;The Ballad of John Axon&quot; (1958), about an engine driver who died trying to stop a runaway freight train
# &quot;Song of a Road&quot; (1959), about the men who built the London-Yorkshire motorway, the M1
# &quot;Singing the Fishing&quot; (1960), about the men and women of the herring fishing fleets of East Anglia and Northeast Scotland
# &quot;The Big Hewer&quot; (1961), about the miners of the Northumberland, Durham, South Wales and East Midlands coalfields
# &quot;The Body Blow&quot; (1962), about people suffering from polio
# &quot;On the Edge&quot; (1963), about teenagers in Britain
# &quot;The Fight Game&quot; (1963), about boxers
# &quot;The Travelling People&quot; (1964), about the nomadic peoples of Ireland and Britain.

&quot;Singing the Fishing&quot; won the Prix Italia for radio documentary in October 1960. All eight radio ballads were released on LP, by Argo Records, and later on CD. They are also available via Listen Again on 
the BBC Radio 2 website.

A book about the making of the radio ballads was published on the fiftieth anniversary of the first broadcast of &quot;John Axon&quot;. &quot;Set into Song: Ewan MacColl, Charles Parker and the Radio Ballads&quot; was written and researched by Peter Cox, published by Labatie Books and has an extensive website which carries the first two pages of each chapter, the complete transcripts and cast lists for each programme, bibliography, footnotes and reviews.

===Transmission dates===
* &quot;The Ballad of John Axon&quot; - 2 July 1958
* &quot;Song Of A Road&quot; - 5 November 1959
* &quot;Singing The Fishing&quot; - 16 August 1960
* &quot;The Big Hewer&quot; - 18 August 1961
* &quot;The Body Blow&quot; - 27 March 1962
* &quot;On The Edge&quot; - 13 February 1963
* &quot;The Fight Game&quot; - 3 July 1963
* &quot;The Travelling People&quot; - 17 April 1964

===Missing ballads===
In an unpublished letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in 1999, Ian Campbell detailed a further two programmes made a year apart, by Parker, with music by Campbell (and John Chapman in the former case), without the involvement of MacColl or Seeger, and broadcast, according to Campbell, &quot;to critical acclaim&quot;, then &quot;consigned… to permanent oblivion&quot;.

* &quot;The Jewellery&quot; - about Birmingham&#x27;s Jewellery Quarter. No programme with this title appears in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; but an episode of &quot;People Today&quot; broadcast on the Home Service on 12 April 1962 was produced by Charles Parker so may have been a source of material.
* &quot;Cry from the Cut&quot; - about the Midlands canal network, broadcast on BBC Home Service Midland, 13 February 1962.

==2006 radio ballads==
In 2006, BBC Radio 2 broadcast six new radio ballads using the same format, with musical direction by John Tams, and contributions from Karine Polwart, Jez Lowe and Cara Dillon among others.

The following ballads were broadcast between February and April 2006: &quot;The Song of Steel&quot; on the decline of the Sheffield and Rotherham Steel Industry (27 February); &quot;The Enemy That Lives Within&quot;, on HIV/AIDS (6 March); &quot;The Horn of the Hunter&quot;, on Foxhunting (13 March); &quot;Swings and Roundabouts&quot;, on Travellers who run fairgrounds (20 March) &quot;Thirty Years of Conflict&quot;; on The Troubles in Northern Ireland (27 March); and &quot;The Ballad of the Big Ships&quot;, on the shipyards of the Tyne and the Clyde, (3 April).

All were later released on CD, and a separate CD was also released containing a selection of the songs drawn from across the series.

==2010 Ballad of the Miners&#x27; Strike==
In 2010, to mark the 25th Anniversary of the 1984-85 Miners&#x27; Strike, the BBC broadcast a new Radio Ballad, the &quot;Ballad of the Miners&#x27; Strike&quot;.

==2012 Olympic Games radio ballads==
In 2012 BBC Radio 2 broadcast a series of six new radio ballads on the subject of the Olympic Games with original songs from Nancy Kerr, Jez Lowe, Julie Matthews, Martin Simpson and Boo Hewerdine amongst others.

The following ballads were broadcast in July and August 2012: &quot;Olympia&quot; on the origins of the Olympic Games; &quot;Berlin&quot; which focused on the 1936 Summer Olympics; &quot;Munich&quot; on the 1972 Summer Olympics; &quot;Controversies&quot;; &quot;Going for Gold&quot;; and &quot;The Marathon&quot;.

==Raidió Teilifís Éireann==
On 13 September 2020 RTE broadcast &quot;The Ballad of the Stolwijk Rescue&quot;, possibly the first Irish radio ballad, based around an interview with the last eyewitness to a dramatic rescue from a Dutch shipwreck and the music of Brían Mac Gloinn.

== 2021 The Song of the Golden Road ==
In 2021, west-wales based community arts organisation SPAN Arts, working with community development charity PLANED, and using a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, produced a new radio ballad entitled &quot;The Song of the Golden Road&quot; (in Welsh, &quot;Cân y Ffordd Euraidd&quot;). The hour-long piece in English and in Welsh focusses on the bilingual rural communities of the Preseli Hills in north Pembrokeshire.

== 21st Century Folk ==
In January 2023 the BBC released a set of folk songs about five people from the north-east of England, under the title &quot;21st Century Folk&quot;. They were described as a &quot;modern take&quot; on the radio ballad.

<doc id="635568" wikidata="Q1397639" url="?curid=635568" title="FastTracker 2">
<text>FastTracker 2 (also referred to as FastTracker II) is a music tracker created by Fredrik &quot;Mr. H&quot; Huss and Magnus &quot;Vogue&quot; Högdahl, two members of the demogroup Triton (who later founded Starbreeze Studios) who set about releasing their own tracker after breaking into the scene in 1992 and winning several demo competitions. The source code of FastTracker 2 is written in Pascal using Borland Pascal 7 and TASM. The program works natively under MS-DOS.

== History ==
In 1993, Triton released FastTracker. This tracker was able to load and save standard four channel MOD files, as well as extended MOD files with six or eight channels (identical to standard MOD files, aside from the extra channel data and ID markers &quot;6CHN&quot; or &quot;8CHN&quot;). It was only compatible with Creative Labs&#x27; SoundBlaster series of sound cards, which were most popular on the PC at that time. The whole editor was a single 43 KiB DOS executable.

Through 1994, the musicians in Triton released some songs in a new multichannel &quot;XM&quot; format, accompanied by a pre-release, standalone player. In November 1994, FastTracker 2 was released to the public, with support for the Gravis Ultrasound sound card.

=== Discontinuation ===
The last stable release of FastTracker 2 was version 2.08, released in August 1997. A newer version 2.09 was under test as closed beta and became available to the public by Andreas Viklund&#x27;s website in 1999. This version had a few new usability additions, such as the possibility to exit previously &quot;stuck&quot; windows by only using the mouse, but broke support for the Gravis Ultrasound card. While not an official release it was made later available also from Starbreeze&#x27;s website.

On May 23, 1999, Starbreeze productions announced on their website that &quot;FT2 has been put on hold indefinitely. [...] If this was an ideal world, where there was infinite time and no need to make a living, there would definitely be a multiplatform Fasttracker3. Unfortunately this world is nothing like that,&quot; signed by Vogue.

=== Legacy ===
After the announcement that support and development for FT2 would be stopped, Ruben Ramos Salvador (BakTery) started working on a &quot;FastTracker 3&quot; that is now known as Skale Tracker, available for both Windows, Linux and online. In later years many other trackers tried to follow up on the legacy of FT2, a notable example being MilkyTracker, with special playback modes available for improved Amiga Protracker 2/3 compatibility. See also the Clone section below.

After development of FT2 was discontinued, a project led by developer Olav Sørensen to accurately re-implement FT2 in C for modern platforms using SDL 2 was started. Sørensen stated that he based his clone partly on the original FT2 source code. On April 22, 2017, an alpha build of the &quot;FastTracker II clone&quot; was released on the author&#x27;s homepage for Windows and macOS. In July 2018, he released the source code of his FT2 continuation, later under the 3-clause BSD license, along with compile instructions for Linux on his website. Shortly after the release, an official FreeBSD port was created. The code is now available for collaboration on GitHub

== Architecture and features ==

The FT2 interface is largely inspired by the looks of Amiga&#x27;s Protracker. The screen consists of a pattern editor in the lower half, while the upper half features an instrument selector on the right, and the general module settings and some oscilloscopes. The pattern editor can be switched to sample/instrument editors. The program also features a little &quot;Nibbler&quot; clone and in-software documentation for all the features.

=== Patterns ===
Patterns are essentially sheets of music where the musician is able to arrange the actual musical score. A pattern consists of several rows (64 by default, 1024 maximum) and is divided to columns (&quot;tracks&quot;). Each row can have one note in every track. A note can look like the following:

 C#4 02 20 R11

This means the note is a C#-note on the chromatic scale, played at the 4th octave (according to the scientific pitch notation), with instrument number 2. The next column is the volume setting on a 00H-40H hexadecimal scale, and the last column enables a variety of effects to be applied to the sound (in this case, retriggering).

A song consists of a collection of different patterns which can be played in a user-defined order to create the final song structure.

=== Samples ===
Samples are raw PCM sound data to be played back at various frequencies, much the way normal musical samplers do. Samples can have a loop start and end point, either repeated continuously or a &quot;ping-pong loop&quot;, which essentially means the sample plays in reverse as soon as it hits the loop start or end (this is also called a &quot;bidirectional loop&quot;). The musicians are able to either record samples or load existing ones, manipulate them by cutting and/or pasting parts, or just draw them by hand. There&#x27;s also a feature to crossfade the sample, thus allowing the loop points to appear seamless.

=== Instruments ===
Instruments are essentially arrays of samples with additional convenience features. A musician can assign different samples to different pitches of the sound, thus eliminating the possibility of a sample sounding bad if played too high or too low. Instruments support various loopable envelopes to be set on either the sound volume or the stereo panning, as well as built-in vibrato. It is also possible to set the generic settings of the instrument here: fine-tuning, default volume, default panning and relative starting note to C-4.

FT2 can get input from a normal PS/2 keyboard and make a live record with it (in the QWERTY keyboard layout, &quot;q&quot; would map to C, &quot;2&quot; would map to C#, &quot;w&quot; would map to D, etc.). FT2 was popular with many musicians who didn&#x27;t have MIDI-compatible keyboards as they could experience live recording without any equipment other than a PC running DOS.

=== Effects ===
Each track has an &quot;effects column&quot; which allows the addition of effects such as arpeggio, portamento, vibrato and volume slides. Some control over the song structure can be handled in this column too, with commands for looping and breaking from and delaying patterns, or retriggering, cutting and delaying notes.
In addition, a &quot;volume column&quot; allows additional control over volume slides, vibrato, panning and tone portamento.

Full list of Effect types (.MOD/.XM) and compatibility with trackers:

=== Files ===
FastTracker 2 supports a variety of file formats, though often only two were used by musicians: XM (Extended Module) and XI (Extended Instrument). XM was and still is one of the most popular module formats nowadays, because of its compact and well compressible file structure.

MOD format supported 4 channels maximum in a song, XM format, 32 channels maximum in a song, though there could be multiple instrument on one channel. ( from Channel n°0 to channel n°31 )

Some players — such as ModPlug Player — support the zip-compressed .XMZ and .MDZ formats, which are simple ZIP archives that contain a .XM or .MOD file respectively.

The ADPCM-compressed XM extension is an XM subformat introduced in ModPlug tracker and player. It has the same XM file format structure, except that at least one of the samples is compressed in 4-bit ADPCM format. An ADPCM-compressed sample is almost two times smaller than its uncompressed equivalent. The drawback is the sound quality – significant distortion may arise when using ADPCM.

Another known extension is OXM – Vorbis-compressed XM. It preserves the original XM file structure, except the samples, which are compressed using the Vorbis codec.

The Stripped XM file format is another XM subformat. It was introduced in uFMOD in 2006. A Stripped XM file is smaller than a regular XM, because it uses a more compact set of headers. The audio content of the XM file is left untouched.

Even more non-standard XM extensions exist. For example, some trackers introduce undocumented effect commands used as triggers for software events, Text2Speech (TTS) metadata, watermarks and so on.

=== Compatibility ===
FT2 ran with a custom made DOS 32-bit extender and it supports the Gravis Ultrasound, Sound Blaster, Covox, and the simple PC speaker. This rendered the software rather flaky to use nowadays, as the recent Windows versions generally do not allow DOS applications to access hardware directly, let alone the fact that most of those compatible cards are built for ISA slots, which are absent from recent motherboards. Due to this, hardcore musicians who still want to use FT2 often build &quot;old school&quot; PCs with the optimal (and nowadays rather cheap) hardware for the tracker, just to be able to track with it again.

An alternative way of getting FT2 to run is by using DOSBox — this, however, as accurate as is, has speed and latency problems, and one needs quite a muscular PC to be able to use it as comfortably as on a native environment. The release of DOSBox 0.7 in March 2007 substantially improved speed/performance problems. Other methods of usage include GUSEMU or VDMSound.

== Reception and impact ==
FT2 got broadly popular in the demoscene and among tracker musicians in the late 1990s. FT2&#x27;s biggest &quot;rivals&quot; in the scene were Scream Tracker and, in later years, Impulse Tracker. &quot;FT2 vs IT&quot; is a common and still ongoing debate among musicians, usually involving IT users complaining about FT2&#x27;s mouse interface, while FT2 users praise that same interface, and point out that every mouse feature has a keyboard shortcut as well.

=== Clones ===
The FT2 inspired multiple later trackers in UX, design and technical capabilities and became therefore the starting point of a family of clones.
Notably here, Ruben Ramos Salvador&#x27;s clone &quot;FastTracker 3&quot; (which later became Skale Tracker) and MilkyTracker. MilkyTracker is cross platform software and provides nearly all functionality available in the original FT2, with various other features. The GUI looks close, but intentionally different from the original. The shareware program &quot;Renoise&quot; also takes a portion of FT2&#x27;s basic GUI and featureset-design, even though there are various major changes in its concept. Another early &quot;FastTracker 2&quot;-compatible tracker for windows was &quot;ModPlug Tracker&quot; (later OpenMPT), a tool which was also compatible with many other contemporary DOS trackers. &quot;SoundTracker&quot; (not to be confused with Ultimate Soundtracker) is a free (GPL-licensed) FT2-style tracker program for Unix-like operating systems. For many years, it was one of the very few mature Unix-based tracker programs.

Recently, a modern clone named &quot;FastTracker II clone&quot; was released; it is written in C and uses SDL 2 to allow for easier porting. Though it runs on modern operating systems, it is otherwise nearly identical in functionality, with hotkeys and visuals accurate to the original.

=== Professional usage===
Video game developer Nicklas Nygren used Fast Tracker 2 (e.g. Knytt Stories) to compose his early video game music. Demoscener and video game soundtrack composer Matthias Le Bidan used FT2 for the music of the free and open source video games &quot;Frozen Bubble&quot; and &quot;Pathological&quot;. The FT2-based soundtrack of &quot;Frozen Bubble&quot; won The Linux Game Tome&#x27;s &quot;Best Sound/Music&quot; Award in 2003. 
Lee Jackson used FT2 to compose the MOD files used in the Apogee Software game, &quot;Stargunner&quot;. 

Several commercial computer games by Epic Games like &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; used the FastTracker 2 XM format (additionally to other mod formats) encapsulated in a &quot;UMX&quot; Container, supported by the used &quot;Galaxy Sound Engine&quot;. Jarkko Rotstén also uses the XM format for 3D Realms&#x27;s &quot;Ion Fury&quot; soundtrack.

FastTracker 2 has also been used in the &quot;dance&quot; music scene of the 1990s and early 2000s: Gabber, Speedcore and breakcore producers were using it, including Deadnoise, Noisekick, Neophyte.

<text>Harry Clifford Pidgeon (August 31, 1869 – November 4, 1954) was an American sailor, a noted photographer, and was the second person to sail single-handedly around the world (1921-1925), 23 years after Joshua Slocum. Pidgeon was the first person to sail a yacht around the world via the Panama Canal and the Cape of Good Hope, the first person to solo-circumnavigate by way of the Panama Canal, and the first person to solo circumnavigate the world twice (the second time was 1932–1937). On both voyages, he sailed a 34-foot yawl named &quot;Islander&quot;, which Pidgeon built himself on a beach in Los Angeles. Prior to his first trip, Pidgeon had no sailing experience and was referred to in the press as the &quot;Library Navigator&quot;. He accounts for his adventure in his book, &quot;Around the World Single-Handed: The Cruise of the &quot;Islander&quot;&quot; (1932).

==Biography==
Harry Clifford Pidgeon was born 31 August 1869 on a farm in Iowa. His father, Isaac Marion Pidgeon, was married 3 times and had a total of 12 children. The family were Quakers. At the age of 15, he set out for California where he found work on a ranch. Before long, he traveled north to Alaska, where he took a raft down the Yukon River and spent some time sailing among the small islands of the southeastern Alaskan coast. Later, he returned to California and traveled and worked in the Sierra Nevada mountains, taking up a career in photography.

===&quot;Islander&quot;===
In 1917, Pidgeon started constructing the &quot;Islander&quot; in the Port of Los Angeles from plans he copied from &quot;Rudder&quot; magazine. The &quot;Islander&quot; cost $1,000 in materials and took a year and a half to build. Upon completion, he tested the yawl with trips to Catalina Island and then to Hawaii and back. Because all of his initial knowledge of seafaring and boatbuilding came from reading, he was dubbed the &quot;Library Navigator&quot; in the press.

===Solo circumnavigations===
After he gained confidence in his boat and his abilities, Pidgeon set out for the Marquesas Islands on November 18, 1921. This began his first four-year circumnavigation. His leisurely trip included stays in the Marquesas, Samoa, Fiji, New Hebrides, New Guinea, the Torres Strait, Christmas Island, the Cocos Islands, Mauritius, Cape Town, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Trinidad Island, Cristobal, the Panama Canal, and his return to Los Angeles on October 31, 1925. He published an account of the voyage in his 1932 book, &quot;Around the World Single-Handed.&quot;

In 1926 he was awarded the Blue Water Medal.

In 1932, Pidgeon embarked on another solo circumnavigation, this one lasting five years.

===Later life and the demise of the &quot;Islander&quot;===
He met his wife, Margaret Dexter Gardner, in Byram, Connecticut. They were married 6 May 1944. Of his marriage, Pidgeon said, &quot;I have never been married, but now that I was 72 years old, I considered myself sufficiently ripe to give it a try.&quot; His wife was the daughter of an oceangoing sea captain and was born aboard the &quot;J.H. Dexter&quot;.

In 1947, he and Margaret and one crewman set out for yet another circumnavigation. On this trip, on January 23, 1948, the &quot;Islander&quot; was damaged by rough weather and then broken up on some rocks in Hog Harbour on the island of Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides Islands. Only some navigation equipment and the sails were salvageable.

Pidgeon died of pneumonia on November 4, 1954, at the age of 85 at the San Pedro Community Hospital in San Pedro, California.

==Photography==
Pidgeon&#x27;s photographs are highly valued for their ethnographic significance.
He left over 1,500 negatives of his trips with the Mohle family (Commander Robert Mohle of Manhattan Beach, CA). These are now in the collection of the California Museum of Photography at the University of California, Riverside.

There is also a collection of his work from the Sierras, documenting the everyday life in the logging community, at the California State University, Fresno.

Another small collection, including glass plate negatives of both Pidgeon&#x27;s time in Yosemite&#x27;s Sugar Pine logging camps and his circumnavigation along with maps, books and other artifacts Pidgeon collected during his travels has remained in the family, and now belongs to Mr. Michael McKinney, Pidgeon&#x27;s great-great-nephew.

==Legacy==
Pidgeon donated items from his voyages to the Cabrillo Museum in Los Angeles.

Pidgeon was somewhat unusual in that his trips were not done as tests of his bravery, publicity stunts, or any reason other than interest in seeing the world. Moreover, Pidgeon had no previous experience with ocean navigation, boat-building, or long-distance sailing.

At the end of his book he wrote: &quot;My voyage was not undertaken for the joy of sailing alone. It was my way of seeing some interesting parts of the world...Just the same, any landsman who builds his own vessel and sails it alone around the world will certainly meet with some adventures, so I shall offer no apology for my own voyage. Those days were the freest and happiest of my life.&quot;

<text>Axel Evert Taube (; 12 March 1890 – 31 January 1976) was a Swedish author, artist, composer and singer. He is widely regarded as one of Sweden&#x27;s most respected musicians and the foremost troubadour of the Swedish ballad tradition in the 20th century.

==Early life==
Evert Taube was born in 1890 in Gothenburg, and brought up on the island of Vinga, Västergötland, where his father, Carl Gunnar Taube, a ship&#x27;s captain, was the lighthouse keeper. His mother was Julia Sofia Jacobsdotter. Taube belongs to an untitled branch of the Baltic German noble Taube family, introduced at the Swedish House of Nobility in 1668 as noble family No. 734.

==Career==

Having spent two years (1907–1909) sailing around the Red Sea, Ceylon and South Africa, Taube began his career as a singer-songwriter and collector of sailors&#x27; songs, and on Christmas Eve 1908, on board the Norwegian ship &quot;SS Bergen&quot; headed for Spain, he performed &quot;Turalleri, piken fra Hamburg&quot;.

Following a five-year stay (1910–1915) in Argentina, he developed an interest in Latin American music and introduced the Argentinian tango to Sweden in the twenties. Contrary to widespread perceptions, Taube did not work as a gaucho (cowboy) on the Pampas but as a foreman supervising workers who were digging canals designed to prevent flooding on the vast plains.

He is perhaps best known as a depictor of the idyllic, with motifs from the Swedish archipelagoes and from the Mediterranean, from a perspective every Swedish four-week holiday tourist could recognize. But he also wrote the most hard-hitting anti-fascist anti-war poem in the Swedish language, &quot;Målaren och Maria Pia&quot;, about the Italian war in Abyssinia, from the late 1930s. He also composed the anthem of the budding environmental movement in the 1970s, &quot;Änglamark&quot; (originally written for the successful 1971 Hasse &amp; Tage film &quot;The Apple War&quot;).

Taube&#x27;s literary secretary Inga-Britt Fredholm worked as a secretary at the Park Avenue Hotel in Gothenburg starting in the late 1950s. There, in 1962, Evert Taube met her and this led to her becoming his literary secretary for more than ten years. During the 1964–1965 period she undertook travel for work, along with Taube, going to the Antibes in France and to the Pampas in Argentina. She collaborated with Astri Taube on &quot;Vid tiden för Astri och Apollon: okända dikter och berättelser&quot;, published in 1964.

During the 1960s Fredholm collected Evert Taube&#x27;s stories and published them in eight volumes at Albert Bonniers Förlag under the shared title of &quot;Samlade berättelser med tillhörande visor och ballader&quot;, released 1966–1967. In the 1970s she produced two pictorial biographies of Taube: ”När jag var en ung caballero: en bildbiografi&quot; (1970) and ”Kom i min famn: Evert Taube 1920-1971 : en bildbiografi&quot; (1972).

Among Taube&#x27;s most famous songs are &quot;Calle Schewens vals&quot;, &quot;Min älskling (du är som en ros)&quot;, &quot;Dans på Sunnanö&quot;, &quot;Brevet Från Lillan&quot;, &quot;Flickan i Havanna&quot;, &quot;Änglamark&quot;, &quot;Sjösala vals&quot;, &quot;Fritiof och Carmencita&quot;, &quot;Så skimrande var aldrig havet&quot; and &quot;Så länge skutan kan gå&quot;.

In 1976 he released an album of songs (on SR Records) about and by Sweden&#x27;s 18th-century bard, Carl Michael Bellman, performing 9 of Bellman&#x27;s &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot; including the ever popular &quot;Vila vid denna källa&quot;, &quot;Ulla! min Ulla! säj, får jag dig bjuda&quot;, and &quot;Solen glimmar blank och trind&quot;.

Taube has been translated into English by Helen Asbury, Paul Britten Austin, Emily Melcher and others. His songs have been recorded in English by Roger Whittaker, Sven-Bertil Taube, Martin Best, Roger Hinchliffe and Emily Melcher.

==Personal life==

In 1925, he married Astri Bergman Taube, a painter and sculptor.

Taube is the father of Sven-Bertil Taube who also is a well known musician and actor in Sweden. Sven-Bertil along with covering his fathers songs also covered other poets and artists such as Carl Michael Bellman and Nils Ferlin.

Taube died in Stockholm and is buried on the churchyard of Maria Magdalena Church on Södermalm.

Taube had a summer house called &quot;Sjösala&quot;, located in Stavsnäs, which was burned down by Mona Wallén-Hjerpe in 1969.

==Honors==
On his 60th birthday in 1950, Taube received the Bellman Award from the Swedish Academy and in 1960 he received an honorary doctorate from Gothenburg University. He was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1970.

Taube is regarded as one of the finest troubadours in Sweden. There is a complete pavilion, &quot;Evert Taube&#x27;s World&quot; opened in 2008, dedicated to him at Liseberg Theme Park in Gothenburg.

On 25 March 2010, Norwegian Air Shuttle&#x27;s (Norwegian.com) new Boeing 737-8FZ LN-NOV (msn 31713) was accepted at the Oslo (Gardermoen) base with the tail image of Evert Taube.

On 6 April 2011, the Bank of Sweden announced that Taube&#x27;s portrait will feature on the 50 kronor banknote, beginning in 2014–15.

On 12 March 2013, a Google Doodle was dedicated to him.

<text>Spiez is a town and municipality on the shore of Lake Thun in the Bernese Oberland region of the Swiss canton of Bern. It is part of the Frutigen-Niedersimmental administrative district. Besides the town of Spiez, the municipality also includes the settlements of Einigen, Hondrich, Faulensee, and Spiezwiler.

The official language of Spiez is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==History==
Spiez is first mentioned around 761-62 as &quot;Spiets&quot;.

The area between the Kander and Lake Thun in modern Spiez was home to several large Bronze and Iron Age settlements. Three separate Bronze Age cemeteries with numerous graves contained a wealth of bronze axes, knives and cloak pins from 1750 to 1500 BC. On a nearby hill, the &quot;Bürg&quot; site is slightly younger and contained knives, arrow and spear heads, a horse&#x27;s bridle and a razor. The &quot;Eggli&quot; hill top was apparently a religious site during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The center of the religious site was a granite block surrounded by ash from fires and thousands of shattered ceramic fragments. The &quot;Eggli&quot; site was probably used from about 1500 until 500 BC. Celtic graves from the 4th to 2nd century BC contained gold, amber and glass ornaments which were imported from over the Alps. A rare funerary urn was buried at Faulensee during the 1st century BC.

During the Roman era there was no permanent settlement in the area, but some Roman coins and Roman graves have been discovered. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and into the Early Middle Ages the Spiez area was home to several scattered settlements. According to Elogius Kiburger, the author of the Strättliger Chronicle, in 933 the King of Burgundy, Rudolph II, built Spiez Castle. Shortly thereafter, the Freiherr von Strättligen settled in the castle. Portions of the current castle shield walls and main tower were built during the 12th century and by the 13th century the town of Spiez existed outside the castle walls. By 1280 the castle was listed as an Imperial fief under Vogt Richard von Corbières. In 1289 the Freiherr von Strättligen was co-owner of the castle along with a succession of other noble families. In 1308 King Albert I of Habsburg was murdered at Windisch on the Reuss, by his nephew Duke John Parricida. As part of their retaliation for the murder, the Habsburgs withdrew half of the Spiez fief from Thüring von Brandis and granted the whole fief to Johannes von Strättligen. Thirty years later, in 1338, Johannes sold the castle, town, church and surrounding villages to Johann II von Bubenberg who was the Schultheiss of Bern. By 1340, the Bubenberg appointed vogt took orders from Bern, but was obligated to raise troops for the Habsburgs. As Bern was de facto independent from their former overlords, the Habsburgs, this created an unstable situation which remained for over 40 years. After the Bernese and Swiss Confederation victory over the Habsburgs in the Battle of Sempach in 1386, the Habsburgs gave up their land claims west of the Aare, which included Spiez.

The former Church of St. Laurentius, next to the castle, was first mentioned in 761–62, when the patronage rights over the church were given to Ettenheim Monastery in Breisgau. The church was one of the twelve Lake Thun churches in the Strättliger Chronicle. The current early Romanesque building was built during the 7th or 8th century, while the crypt dates from about 1000. Outside the church, a number of graves from the 7th and 8th centuries have also been discovered. It was the parish church for a parish that included Spiez, Spiezwiler, Einigen, Faulensee and Hondrich. When Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation in 1528, the church became the center of the new Reformed parish.
The castle and surrounding land remained with the Bubenberg family until their extinction in 1506, when it was acquired by Ludwig von Diesbach. Von Diesbach held it for ten years before Ludwig von Erlach acquired the castle and lands. The von Erlach family ruled the town and villages until the 1798 French invasion.

The town charter was first documented in 1406, however there were citizens of Spiez with some codified rights as far back as 1312. A town wall was built early in Spiez&#x27;s history. However, it fell into disrepair and was destroyed in a fire in 1600. Over time the surrounding villages came to be included in the town charter and their residents became citizens of Spiez. After the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the Helvetic Republic, the von Erlach family lost their land rights and jurisdiction over the village, but retained ownership of the castle until 1875.
Historically the residents of Spiez and the surrounding villages raised orchards and vineyards on along the lake, fished in the lake and shipped goods along the lake or raised crops in the valleys. The vineyards of Spiez were first mentioned in 1338 and remained in operation until an outbreak of disease destroyed the plants in 1900. An attempt in 1927 to restart the wine industry on Spiez mountain and at Faulensee was fairly successful. The villages along the Kander were often threatened by flooding, until the Kander was diverted into the lake in 1711–13. The construction of the Lake Thun road in 1844 and steam ship docks in 1835, 1876 and 1926 helped open the town to the rest of the country. Due to the mild climate and transportation links, Spiez became a popular health and spa town in the 19th century. Beginning in 1856 resorts and hotels, including the Schonegg, Spiezerhof and Faulensee-Bad, opened along the lake shore. The Thun-Spiez-Interlaken (1893), Spiez-Zweisimmen-Montreux (1897-1905) and Spiez-Frutigen-Lötschberg-Simplon (1901–13) railroads all helped the tourist industry and the rest of the town to grow. The growing population led to the construction of a secondary school and seven primary schools around the municipality. In the 1980s the A6 and A8 motorways further connected Spiez and the surrounding villages. In 1990 the Kander Tunnel opened, which helped reduce noise and pollution in the municipality.

<text>The Stele Forest or Beilin Museum is a museum for steles and stone sculptures in Beilin District in Xi&#x27;an, Northwest China. The museum, which is housed in a former Confucian Temple, has housed a growing collection of Steles since 1087. By 1944 it was the principal museum for Shaanxi province. Due to the large number of steles, it was officially renamed the Forest of Stone Steles in 1992. Altogether, there are 3,000 steles in the museum, which is divided into seven exhibitions halls that display works of Chinese calligraphy, painting and historical records.

==History==
The Stele Forest began with the &quot;Kaicheng Shi Jing Steles&quot; () and &quot;Shitai Xiao Jing Steles&quot; (), two groups of steles both carved in the Tang dynasty and displayed in the temple to Confucius and the Imperial College in Chang&#x27;an, capital of the empire. In 904, a rebel army sacked Chang&#x27;an, and the steles were evacuated to the inner city. In 962, they were returned to the rebuilt temple. In the Song dynasty, a special hall with attached facilities was built to house and display the two stele groups. It was damaged in the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake during the Ming dynasty. In 1936, famous Chinese calligrapher Yu Youren donated his entire collection of more than three hundred rubbings from steles to the Xian Forest of Stele Museum. It became a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level in 1961 and thus survived the Cultural Revolution.

==Steles==
It houses nearly 3,000 steles and it is the biggest collection of steles in China. Most of its exhibits are steles of the Tang dynasty. Ink rubbings of the steles are available for sale.

Among the unusual examples is an 18th-century stele depicting a Yangtze River flood control project. Another appears to be a bamboo forest, but on examination the leaves and branches form a poem.

The famous Xi&#x27;an Stele was moved to the Stele Forest in 1907, after the local authorities learned that the Danish adventurer Frits Holm was in town, trying to &quot;obtain&quot; the ancient monument and take it out of the country.

The collections of the Beilin Museum are far more extensive than suggested by this inadequate thumbnail stub. To give but one example, artifacts produced by the ancient buddhasasansangha of part of China are well represented: Buddhist Sculpture from China: Selections from the Xi&#x27;an Beilin Museum Fifth through Ninth Centuries (China Institute Gallery, New York, 2007).

<doc id="635586" wikidata="Q502943" url="?curid=635586" title="Andrey Razumovsky">
<text>Count (later Prince) Andrey Kirillovich Razumovsky (2 November 1752 – 23 September 1836) was a Russian diplomat who spent many years of his life in Vienna. His name is transliterated differently in different English sources, including spellings Razumovsky, Rasumofsky, and Rasoumoffsky.

==Life==
Razumovsky was the son of Kirill Razumovsky, the last hetman of the Zaporizhian Host, and of his wife, Catherine Naryshkina, a cousin of Elizabeth of Russia. He was also a nephew of the Elizabeth&#x27;s lover, Aleksey Grigorievich Razumovsky, called the &quot;Night Emperor&quot; of Russia. The elder Rasumovsky&#x27;s late Baroque palace on the Nevsky Prospekt is a minor landmark in Saint Petersburg. In 1792, Andrey Kirillovich was appointed the tsar&#x27;s diplomatic representative to the Habsburg court in Vienna, one of the crucial diplomatic posts during the Napoleonic era.

In 1779, Razumovsky became the first Russian ambassador in the Kingdom of Naples.
He was a chief negotiator during the Congress of Vienna that re-organised Europe in 1814, and asserted Russian rights in Poland.

In 1808, he established a house string quartet consisting of Ignaz Schuppanzigh, Louis Sina, Franz Weiss, and Joseph Linke. Razumovsky was an accomplished amateur violinist, and also known as a competent torban (see also: theorbo) player. The Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna holds one of the four torbans known to have been in his possession. His commissioning three string quartets from Beethoven in 1806 was the act that has made his name familiar. He asked Beethoven to include a Russian theme in each quartet: Beethoven included such kind of themes in the first two.

Razumovsky was the brother-in-law of another of Beethoven&#x27;s patrons, Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz. His first wife, Countess Elisabeth von Thun und Hohenstein was a sister in law of Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky von Woschütz.

== The &quot;Palais Rasumofsky&quot; ==
Razumovsky built a magnificent Neoclassic palace worthy of the representative of Alexander I, at his own expense and to the designs of Louis Montoyer, on the Landstraße, quite close to Vienna, and filled it with antiquities and modern works of art. In the morning of 31 December 1814, during the preparation of a ball with the Tsar Alexander I as guest of honor, a fire broke out in a temporary ballroom extension, setting the ballroom ablaze and burning out roomfuls of art in the back wing of the palace. Even though he was raised to Prince the following year, Razumovsky was never the same. He lived in seclusion in Vienna until his death in 1836. In 1862, the street on which Razumovsky&#x27;s palace is located was named &quot;Rasumofskygasse&quot;.

==Conversion to Roman Catholicism==

Razumovsky converted to Roman Catholicism from his native religion, Russian Orthodoxy, under the influence of his second wife, Countess Konstanze von Thürheim (1785–1867), member of uradel noble family from Swabia and sister of his friend Lulu von Thürheim, whom he married in February 1816.

==Andrey Razumovsky Musical Fest ==

On October 22, 2015 a long-awaited musical event - Andrey Razumovsky IV Regional musical festival-competition of young performers took place in Hetman Razumovsky Palace in Baturin. This tradition started in 2012 in Baturin palace at the time of the 260 birthday anniversary of Andrey Razumovsky. He is world-known for his role as patron of Ludwig van Beethoven who dedicated three String Quartets, Op. 59 1, 2 and 3, as well as the 5th and the 6th Symphonies to him.

<text>The Choloki (, also Cholok) in Georgia forms the border between the autonomous province of Ajaria and the province of Guria. For a time in the 19th century it formed the border between Turkey and Imperial Russia.

== History ==
During the Crimean War the Turks crossed it in 1853 and were driven back the following year during the Battle of Choloki.

Another military episode took place on April 16, 1918, when the Georgian National Guard under General-Lieutenant Giorgi Mazniashvili repelled a Turkish invasion force.

The bridge over Choloki river that was a main road link between Ajaria and the rest of Georgia was blown up on May 2, 2004, by the ousted leadership of the Autonomy. Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze called the decision to blow up the bridges in the Kobuleti border region &quot;a preventive measure against the possible attempt of military action by the central Georgian authorities.&quot;

<text>Islander was the 34-foot yawl with which Harry Pidgeon sailed around the world single-handedly from 1921 to 1925. Pidgeon thus became the second person, after Joshua Slocum, to do so. He accounts for his adventures in his book, Around the World Single-Handed: The Cruise of the Islander (1932).

==History==
&quot;Islander&quot; was modelled on &quot;Sea Bird&quot;, a 25-foot V-bottom boat that was designed by Charles D. Mower with input from Captain Thomas Fleming Day. Pidgeon built &quot;Islander&quot; from 1917 to 1918 using only $1,000 of materials. &quot;Islander&quot; was built mostly from oak, Douglas fir, and Oregon pine. Writing about his voyage later, Pidgeon commented that &quot;Islander&quot; &quot;proved to sail well, and all remarked on the ease with which she handled.&quot;

<doc id="635592" wikidata="Q5163079" url="?curid=635592" title="Conservative Party of New York State">
<text>The Conservative Party of New York State is an American political party founded in 1962 following conservative dissatisfaction with the Republican Party in New York. Running on the Conservative Party line, James L. Buckley won election to the U.S. Senate in 1970 and served for one term. Since 2010, the party has held &quot;Row C&quot; on New York ballots—the third-place ballot position, directly below the Democratic and Republican parties—because it received the third-highest number of votes of any political party in the 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022 New York gubernatorial elections. The party is known for its strategy of attempting to influence the Republican Party in a more conservative direction.

==History==
The Conservative Party of New York State was founded in 1962 by a group including J. Daniel Mahoney, Kieran O&#x27;Doherty, Charles E. Rice, Raymond R. Walker and Charles Edison, out of frustration with the perceived liberalism of the state&#x27;s Republican Party. A key consideration was New York&#x27;s fusion voting, unusual among U.S. states, which allows individual candidates to appear on multiple party lines in the same election. The Liberal Party of New York, founded in 1944, had benefited from this system; the Conservative Party desired to balance the Liberal Party&#x27;s influence. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the party&#x27;s support &quot;came mainly from those who would later be called Reagan Democrats—working-class, urban and suburban, often Catholic.&quot;

===1960s===
Prominent conservative author and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. ran for Mayor of New York City on the Conservative Party line in 1965, winning 13.4% of the vote. An op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Buckley campaign as &quot;a watershed campaign for the Conservatives, who gained heavy publicity and proved their strength in the overwhelmingly Democratic city.&quot; In 1966, Conservative candidate Paul L. Adams obtained more than half a million votes in his race for Governor of New York, winning Row C for the Party.

===1970s===
In 1970, James Buckley, the brother of William F. Buckley Jr., ran for U.S. Senate as the candidate of the Conservative Party. Running only on the Conservative Party line and the Independent Alliance Party line, Buckley defeated Democratic Congressman Richard Ottinger and unelected incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Charles Goodell, receiving 39% of the vote. Buckley served one term in the Senate. According to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;Buckley&#x27;s victory cemented, for a time, an electoral coalition of urban, ethnic Democrats with rural and suburban Republicans—all disgusted with excessive taxation, runaway government spending and the decline of traditional values.&quot; In 1976, Buckley ran for reelection to the U.S. Senate as the candidate of the Republican and Conservative parties, losing to Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

In 1978, registered Conservative William Carney, a member of the Suffolk County legislature, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in New York&#x27;s 1st congressional district, a long-time Democratic stronghold on Long Island, after winning the Republican primary and running on both party lines. He eventually served four terms before retiring.

===1980s===
In 1980, the Conservative Party endorsed Al D&#x27;Amato in a U.S. Senate race in which he successfully challenged incumbent Sen. Jacob Javits in a Republican primary. D&#x27;Amato then narrowly prevailed in the general election over Democrat Elizabeth Holtzman; the 275,100 votes D&#x27;Amato received on the Conservative line exceeded his slim margin of victory.

In the 1982 gubernatorial election, the party nominated Republican Lewis Lehrman, who was narrowly defeated by Democrat Mario Cuomo. In the 1986 gubernatorial election, the party nominated Republican Andrew P. O&#x27;Rourke, who was defeated by Cuomo in a landslide.

===1990s===
Herbert London was the Conservative Party&#x27;s nominee for Governor of New York in 1990; that year, the party broke from the Republican Party, declining to cross-endorse Republican nominee Pierre Rinfret. Conservatives leaders cited Rinfret&#x27;s support for abortion, his perceived lack of seriousness about his candidacy, and his potential difficulties in attacking incumbent Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo on fiscal policies as reasons for their decision to support London instead. London ran a strong campaign statewide and finished one percentage point behind Rinfret, while Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo easily won re-election.

The party declined to endorse Republican Rudy Giuliani for Mayor of New York City in his successful 1993 and 1997 campaigns. In each of those elections, Giuliani accepted the endorsement of the Liberal Party. The Conservative Party endorsed George Marlin for Mayor in 1993 and left its line blank in the 1997 New York City mayoral race.

The party endorsed Republican George Pataki in his successful 1994 campaign to unseat incumbent Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo. In that race, Pataki &quot;drew more than 300,000 votes on the Conservative line, double his slender winning margin over Mr. Cuomo.&quot;

===2000s===
The party ran its own candidates for Mayor of New York City in the 2001, 2005, and 2009, declining to support successful Republican candidate Michael Bloomberg.

John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers, New York, was nominated for U.S. Senate by the Republican and Conservative Parties in the 2006 Senate election against Hillary Clinton. Spencer was defeated by Clinton.

In the 2006 race for governor, Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long endorsed John Faso, the former Assembly Minority Leader and Republican State Comptroller nominee in 2002. Faso won the nomination at the Republican convention, defeating former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, 61–39%. Following the convention, Weld withdrew from the race as senior party officials (including state Republican chairman Stephen Minarik, who endorsed Weld) urged party unity. In the general election, Faso was the nominee of both the Republican and Conservative parties, but was defeated by Eliot Spitzer. 

The Conservative Party nominated Republican candidates John McCain and Sarah Palin for president and vice president in the 2008 election, which was won by Democrat Barack Obama and then vice president Joe Biden.

The Conservative Party nominated Doug Hoffman for the 2009 special election in New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district, an election won by the Democratic nominee, Bill Owens. The Conservative Party chose Hoffman, a fiscal and social conservative, in reaction to the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination of pro-choice, pro-same-sex-marriage, pro-union Assemblymember Dede Scozzafava, who Chairman Mike Long declared to be a &quot;nice lady who is too liberal.&quot; On October 31, 2009, Scozzafava suspended her campaign, leading prominent Republicans such as national chairman Michael Steele to endorse Hoffman. On Election Day, Owens prevailed over Hoffman by a margin of 48.3% to 46%. The 2009 special election received significant national attention, and was alternately described as &quot;a referendum on President Barack Obama&quot; and &quot;a fight over the identity of the Republican Party.&quot; According to one commentator, &quot;tea party conservatives see the GOP loss as a victory for conservativism over mere political party loyalty. They&#x27;re describing the defeat as a warning shot fired in defense of principle.&quot; In addition, elected officials and observers opined that the congressional race affected the New York State Senate&#x27;s December 2, 2009 vote against same-sex marriage legislation.

===2010s===
Party Chairman Michael Long endorsed Rick Lazio for the 2010 New York gubernatorial election and directed his allies to do the same. However, several county chairmen instead coalesced behind vice chairman Ralph Lorigo. Lazio defeated Lorigo in the primary election by a roughly 60–40% margin, but was defeated by Carl Paladino in the Republican primary. Lazio dropped out of the race on September 27, requiring a vacancy committee to convene and select a replacement for him on the Conservative line. Long eventually endorsed Paladino and the vacancy committee followed, placing Paladino on the Conservative Party line. Paladino lost the general election, but drew 232,264 votes on the Conservative Party line, which allowed the party to overtake the Independence Party of New York and retake Row C (the third place ballot position in New York elections) for the first time since the 1998 elections. The party has held Row C ever since. 

Prior to the passage of same-sex marriage legislation in 2011, Long stated that the party would not endorse any candidate who supported same-sex marriage. Four Republican state senators—Sens. James Alesi, Mark Grisanti, Roy McDonald, and Stephen Saland—voted in favor of same-sex marriage. Alesi did not seek re-election in 2012, while Grisanti, McDonald, and Saland faced challengers in 2012 who received the Conservative Party&#x27;s endorsement. Grisanti was re-elected to the State Senate, while McDonald was defeated in a Republican primary and Saland was defeated in a general election in which a Conservative Party-endorsed challenger acted as a spoiler.

State Senator Mark Grisanti, the last remaining Republican state senator to have voted for the Marriage Equality Act, was again denied Conservative Party endorsement in 2014; the party instead endorsed dummy candidate Timothy Gallagher in State Senate District 60. Grisanti lost the Republican primary, but remained in the general election on the Independence line. In the general election, Gallagher—despite not campaigning at all—won 8 percent of the vote; the vote split between Gallagher, Grisanti, and Republican candidate Kevin Stocker allowed Democrat Marc Panepinto to win the election with only 34 percent of the vote.

The Party endorsed Rob Astorino very early in the 2014 gubernatorial election process. In the election for New York State Comptroller, the party threatened to nominate its own candidate if the Republicans could not find a candidate from their party to run on the line; the GOP eventually nominated Onondaga County Comptroller Rob Antonacci.
In 2016, the Conservative Party nominated eventual winner Donald Trump for President of the United States.

On April 13, 2018, the Conservative Party executive committee selected Marcus Molinaro as its candidate in the 2018 gubernatorial election in what Long termed a &quot;not very easy&quot; decision; the party chose Molinaro over Deputy State Senate Majority Leader John A. DeFrancisco and openly refused to consider Erie County Executive Joel Giambra.

The Conservative Party of Cattaraugus County is alleged to have been the target of a hostile takeover by members of the Republican Party, after 37 former Republicans abruptly changed party registration in October 2017. County party chairman Leonard Ciros alleged that the Republican Party violated state party loyalty laws and the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

As of 2018, the Party holds &quot;Row C&quot; on New York ballots—the third-place ballot position, directly below the Democratic and Republican parties—because it received the third-highest number of votes of any political party in the 2010, 2014, and 2018 gubernatorial elections.

Long announced his retirement from the chairmanship of the Conservative Party on January 28, 2019 after having served in that role for 30 years. In February 2019, he was elected Chairman Emeritus of the Party. On February 23, 2019, the Party named Gerard Kassar of Brooklyn as its new chairman.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, the Conservative Party nominated incumbent Republican President Donald Trump for re-election to the presidency. Trump was defeated by Democrat Joe Biden. In 2021, the Conservative Party successfully teamed up with the Republican Party to raise opposition among the state&#x27;s voters and defeat three ballot initiatives proposed by Democrats.

During the 2022 New York gubernatorial election the party endorsed Republican Lee Zeldin who had the best showing as a Republican for governor since 1970 earning 2,762,581 votes and losing to incumbent Kathy Hochul by just 6.39% of the vote.

On August 17, 2024, the Conservative Party nominated Donald Trump for President of the United States during the 2024 presidential election.

On September 30, 2024, Gonzalo Duran, Vice Chairman of the Bronx Conservative Party, expressed interest in running for Mayor of New York City. On November 25, 2024, Duran officially announced his candidacy at the Bronx Conservative Party&#x27;s November meeting. Four days later, on November 29, 2024, Duran confirmed his run for Mayor in a press release.

==Strategy and reputation==
In 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the Conservative Party had &quot;a successful electoral record in a decidedly blue state in which the Conservatives have elbowed the Republican Party to the right&quot;. Also in 2012, the &quot;New York Post&quot; asserted that the Party had &quot;helped the GOP maintain its majority in the state Senate, even as New York has turned an ever-deeper blue over the last half century&quot; and added that it had &quot;forced the state Republican Party to (sometimes) remember what it stood for—by threatening its power&quot;.

Rather than nominating its own candidates, the Conservative Party usually endorses the same candidates as the Republican Party and campaigns against the Democratic candidates. However, the party has withheld support from Republican candidates if it deems them too liberal. For example, the Conservative Party withheld its support from Republican Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s fusion campaigns with endorsement from the Liberal Party for New York City mayor in 1989, 1993 and 1997. In the 2004 U.S. Senate election, the Conservative Party endorsed Marilyn O&#x27;Grady to oppose Republican candidate Howard Mills and incumbent Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. Also in 2004, the Party&#x27;s decision to endorse Tom Dadey rather than incumbent Republican State Senator Nancy Larraine Hoffmann in State Senate District 49 helped bring about the victory of Democrat David Valesky in that race. After losing to Hoffmann in the Republican primary, Dadey—with the support of the Conservative Party and the Independence Party—remained in the race; Hoffmann lost the general election by 742 votes.

Following the passage of same-sex marriage legislation in 2011, the Conservative Party stated that it would withdraw support for any candidate who had voted for the bill; two Republican senators who voted for same-sex marriage—Roy McDonald and Stephen Saland—lost their seats in 2012.

The party has also endorsed Democratic candidates, including controversial former Buffalo mayor and presidential candidate Jimmy Griffin, who was initially elected mayor solely on the Conservative ticket but had Republican support as well for his subsequent campaigns. It also cross-endorsed such Democrats as Asms. Michael Cusick, Michael P. Kearns, and Robin Schimminger and former Capital District Congressman Michael McNulty. In 2022, the party endorsed Democratic Assembly members Simcha Eichenstein and Marianne Buttenschon, as well as Senator Simcha Felder.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West (Warrington) (formerly Wire FM) is an Independent Local Radio station serving the Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn areas of Cheshire.

Following its sale to Bauer Radio, the station was closed and merged with the Greatest Hits Radio network in September 2020.

==History==
Wire FM&#x27;s origins began in 1990 when two presenters at Warrington&#x27;s hospital radio station, Stephen Cooper and Philip Houltby, decided to run an RSL station for the town. Cooper had previous RSL experience via Waves AM in Peterhead.

The station was duly organised and went on air as Warrington Festival of Music Radio (WFMR) for two weeks in May 1991. It broadcast from a borrowed portable cabin located behind the Warrington Town Hall Gates on 1602 kHz, with Matthew Newton &amp; Mark Gabler among the presenting team.

The station was successful in both audience response and commercial respects, and further RSL broadcasts were made in the spring of 1992 and 1993. Stephen Armstrong-Smith and David Duffy joined the management team and a 14&#x27; touring caravan was converted into a mobile studio.

During 1994, the attraction of the caravan had waned. Funding for the Warrington Festival of Music had also decreased with the demise of its main supporter, the Warrington &amp; Runcorn Development Corporation. In the 1994 broadcast presenters were also heard to refer to WFMR as Warrington&#x27;s Favourite Music Radio.

The decision was made to move &#x27;indoors&#x27;, sever the link with the Festival, and switch to FM. This had significant risks, as costs for FM licences were higher, and new transmitters and studio equipment had to be bought. However, the broadcast went ahead during June 1994 from a &#x27;Community House&#x27; on Nora Street in the Howley area of Warrington, borrowed from Warrington Borough Council.

===RSL broadcasts===
The move to FM saw a step change in the popularity of the station with the audience and advertisers. It was decided to repeat the broadcast during November 1994, and the decision was made to change the station name from WFMR to Warrington FM. It was renamed again as Wire FM, to reflect Warrington&#x27;s wire manufacturing heritage.

At the beginning of 1995, Cheshire was added to the Radio Authority&#x27;s list of locations where so-called &#x27;Sallie&#x27; (Small Scale Alternative Location Licence) licences would be advertised. This brought new impetuous and further RSLs were run in June and November 1995. Throughout this period, programming followed a mainstream commercial format, along with regular community features and local news supplied by the Warrington Guardian.

During 1995, with the licence application pending, the Wire FM management team had initially formed an alliance with the Marcher Radio Group to bid for Warrington. However, Marcher were dropped in favour of the Independent Radio Group PLC (IRG), following their formation and subsequent successful bid for Wigan and St. Helens as Wish FM by Tony Dewhurst and Jeff Graham, who also authored the licence application. By this point, Stephen Cooper had left the team, and Stephen Armstrong-Smith had joined IRG as their regional engineer.

During 1996, Cheshire was advertised as the location for two potential radio stations. The remaining members of Wire FM&#x27;s management team, Philip Houltby and David Duffy, assembled the bid in conjunction with IRG&#x27;s licence bid team consisting of New Zealanders Kris Burford and Ande McPherson. Competition for the licence was expected to be strong and significant resources were allocated to the bid resulting in more than 250 letters of support being received and comprehensive research being undertaken and analysed by the most respected research organisations.

===Extended coverage area===
Following a review of the coverage pattern predicted for the High Warren Reservoir transmitter site, the strategic decision was made to include the Borough of Halton (Widnes and Runcorn) in the intended coverage area. To strengthen the bid in Halton, John Grindley (known on air as Phil Johnson) was invited to join the bid and bring his experience of the Halton FM RSL broadcasts to the team.

===Licence bid===
There was much discussion on Widnes and Runcorn&#x27;s acceptance of the name &#x27;Wire&#x27;, however, the Radio Authority later indicated this was a key factor in awarding the licence. Application documents were submitted during May 1997 and the Radio Authority awarded the licence to Wire FM during November 1997.

Competing applications were :
*Warrington – Warrington FM (local consortium, supported by David Rodgers of Orchard FM)
*Warrington – Radio Warrington (Warrington Collegiate Institute-led bid backed by The Wireless Group)
*Halton – Fun FM (backed by The Bay)

Following the licence award, problems with securing an antenna site caused a six-month delay in getting on-air. The original space secured on the High Warren tower operated by Mercury Communications was to another user. But Orange were in the process of securing planning permission for a new, higher tower on close by land owned by Warrington Golf Course. A deal was struck and Orange were able to offer the station the prime antenna location at the top of the tower.

===Station launch===
The station launched under programme director Simon Wynne, who at the time was also PD of 1458 Lite AM in Manchester, and sales director Mark Collins.

Phil Johnson was the first voice on the station, presenting its weekday breakfast show. The first track to be played on the station was Lisa Stansfield&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. Other launch presenters included Pete Pinnington (drive), Lee McGrath (evenings), Bobby Prior, John Seddon (sport) and Tony Johnson (Sunday night).

===Ownership changes===
In 1999, the owners of Wire FM, the Independent Radio Group, were brought by The Wireless Group in 1999. Six years later, TWG was taken over by UTV Media (later Wireless Group).

In February 2019, Wire FM was sold, along with Wireless&#x27;s other local stations, to Bauer Radio.

===Relocation===
In early 2007, the station&#x27;s owners approached UK media regulator OFCOM to ask permission to move the station&#x27;s base from Warrington to the Haydock or Newton-le-Willows area of Merseyside as part of a plan to co-locate with two other stations from the Wireless Group group: Wish FM (Wigan and St Helens) and Tower FM (Bolton and Bury).

The original plan was abandoned but from the autumn of 2009, all three stations were based at studios in the Orrell area of Wigan.

==Station rebrand==
On 8 February 2019, Wire FM and the Wireless Group&#x27;s local radio stations were sold to Bauer Radio. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 27 May 2020, it was announced that Wire FM will join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network.

On 13 July 2020, local programming outside weekday breakfast was replaced by networked output from the GHR network, with Wire FM retaining its own branding.

In September 2020, the station merged with several in the North West of England and North Wales, as Greatest Hits Radio North West. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained. The station&#x27;s Orrell studios were closed.

<text>Belp is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is close to Bern&#x27;s Belp Airport. The municipality of Belpberg merged on 1 January 2012 into the municipality of Belp.

==History==
Belp is first mentioned in 1263 as &quot;Belpo&quot;.

Scattered neolithic artifacts indicate that the Belp area was inhabited prehistorically. Bronze Age cemeteries and La Tène artifacts show that there were villages near modern Belp before the Roman invasion. After the collapse of the Roman Empire the area may have been uninhabited, but by the High Middle Ages there were villages and wooden castles here. Very little is known about Fahrhubel Castle, located about north-west of the Hunzigenbrücke (Hunzigen Bridge), and it was eventually completely demolished.

Hohberg Castle, on the northern slope of the Belpberg, was the ancestral seat of the Freiherren of Belp-Montenach. It was built around 1135 and today only ruins remain. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the family expanded their authority from Belp to include neighboring villages. In 1277 they created the &quot;Herrschaft&quot; of Belp to include all their estates and villages. Their expanding power brought them into conflict with the growing city-state of Bern and in 1298 Bern attacked Belp. At the Battle of Donnerbühl or Dornbühl in 1298 Bern destroyed the castle. Eight years later, in 1306, they forced the Freiherren of Belp-Montenach to become citizens of Bern and give up their independence. The &quot;Hölzernes Schloss&quot; or Wooden Castle was built in 1327 by the Freiherr in Belp village. By the late 14th century the male line of the Belp-Montenach family died out and Belp and the surrounding lands were acquired by a noble family in Bern. Over the following centuries, Belp passed through several noble families. In 1550-54 the von Luternau family built the Old Castle in the village across from the Wooden Castle. The Old Castle was the administrative seat of the &quot;Herrschaft&quot; during the 16th and 17th centuries.

By the 18th century, wealthy Bernese families began moving to Belp to escape the noise and crowding in the city. In 1735 Victor Fischer built Oberried Estate above the growing town. This estate was followed in 1740 by the &quot;Schlössli&quot; or &quot;Neues Schloss&quot; on Rubigenstrasse which was built for the historian Alexander Ludwig von Wattenwyl. Lindenegg Mansion was built in 1800.

The Wooden Castle was demolished in 1783. In 1721 the von Wattenwyl family acquired the &quot;Herrschaft&quot;, which they ruled until the 1798 French invasion and creation of the Helvetic Republic abolished the old aristocratic order. In 1810 the Canton of Bern bought the castle from Karl von Wattenwyl and used it as the center of the newly created Seftigen District.

The village church of St. Peter and Paul was first mentioned in 1228. It was probably established by the Freiherr of Belp. In 1334, Interlaken Monastery received the patronage rights over the church. In 1528, Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and Belp converted. After Bern forcefully secularized Interlaken Monastery, the patronage rights passed to Bern.

The Aare river correction of 1829-31 and the Gürbe river correction of 1855-60 helped open up new farmland and prevented devastating floods in the municipality. The river ferries were replaced with the Hunzigen or August Bridge in 1836. It was replaced with the larger Schützenfahr Bridge in 1883 and today is a covered pedestrian bridge. The Industrial Revolution reached Belp in 1844 when a cloth factory settled in the village. The factory operated until 1974. In 1928-29 the Belpmoos airport opened outside the town. It eventually grew into the Bern-Belp Regional Airport. Today, almost two-thirds of the population commutes to jobs outside the municipality and about two-thirds of the jobs in Belp are in the services sector.

<text>The Dubliners () were an Irish folk band founded in Dublin in 1962 as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, named after its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves The Dubliners. The line-up saw many changes in personnel over their fifty-year career, but the group&#x27;s success was centred on lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew. The band garnered international success with their lively Irish folk songs, traditional street ballads and instrumentals. 

The band were regulars on the folk scenes in both Dublin and London in the early 1960s. They were signed to the Major Minor label in 1965 after backing from Dominic Behan who was paid by the label to work with the group and help them to build a better act fit for larger concert hall venues. The Dubliners worked with Behan regularly between 1965 and 1966; Behan wrote numerous songs for this act including the song McAlpine&#x27;s Fusiliers created specifically to showcase Ronnie Drew&#x27;s gravel voice. They went on to receive extensive airplay on Radio Caroline, which was part-owned by Phil Solomon CEO of Major Minor, and eventually appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1967 with hits &quot;Seven Drunken Nights&quot; (which sold over 250,000 copies in the UK) and &quot;The Black Velvet Band&quot;. Often performing political songs considered controversial at the time, they drew criticism from some folk purists. Ireland&#x27;s national broadcaster RTÉ placed an unofficial ban on their music from 1967 to 1971. During this time the band&#x27;s popularity began to spread across mainland Europe and they appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the United States. The group&#x27;s success remained steady right through the 1970s and a number of collaborations with The Pogues in 1987 saw them enter the UK Singles Chart on another two occasions.

The Dubliners were instrumental in popularising Irish folk music in Europe. They influenced many generations of Irish bands and their legacy can to this day be heard in the music of artists such as The Pogues, Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly. Much adored in their native country, covers of Irish ballads by Ronnie Drew and Luke Kelly tend to be regarded as definitive versions. One of the most influential Irish acts of the 20th century, they celebrated 50 years together in 2012, making them Ireland&#x27;s longest-surviving musical act. Also in 2012, the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards bestowed them with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The Dubliners announced their retirement in the autumn of 2012, after 50 years of performing, following the death of the last living original member Barney McKenna. However, some members of the group continued touring under the name of The Dublin Legends. As of 2024, Sean Cannon is the only remaining member of the Dubliners in that group, following the retirement of Patsy Watchorn in 2014 and the death of Eamonn Campbell in 2017.

==Formation and history==
===Origins===
The Dubliners, initially known as &quot;The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group&quot;, formed in 1962 and made a name for themselves playing regularly in O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s Pub in Dublin. The change of name came about because of Ronnie Drew&#x27;s unhappiness with it, together with the fact that Luke Kelly was reading &quot;Dubliners&quot; by James Joyce at the time. Founding members were Drew, Kelly, Ciarán Bourke and Barney McKenna.

Drew, McKenna and Thomas Whelan had originally teamed up for a fundraising concert and then went on to work in a revue with the Irish comedian John Molloy at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. They used to sing songs between acts.

Before joining the Dubliners full-time, Kelly had spent some time playing at English folk clubs such as the Jug o&#x27;Punch in Birmingham, run by the folk singer Ian Campbell.

The group played at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963 and that led to them being featured on a BBC programme called &quot;Hootenanny&quot;. The extra exposure helped them to win a contract with Transatlantic Records, with whom they recorded their first album, called simply &quot;The Dubliners&quot;. They also recorded their first single featuring &quot;Rocky Road to Dublin&quot; and &quot;The Wild Rover&quot;.

===Members of the group===
Drew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play Flamenco guitar, and he accompanied his songs on a Spanish guitar. Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995. Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent&#x27;s Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness. Paddy Reilly took Drew&#x27;s place in 1995. Some of Drew&#x27;s most significant contributions to the band are the hit single &quot;Seven Drunken Nights&quot;, his rendition of &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot;, and &quot;McAlpine&#x27;s Fusiliers&quot;.

Luke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string banjo. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like &quot;The Black Velvet Band&quot;, &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, &quot;Home Boys Home&quot;; but also Phil Coulter&#x27;s &quot;The Town I Loved So Well&quot;, Ewan MacColl&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot;, &quot;The Wild Rover&quot;, and &quot;Raglan Road&quot;, written by the famous Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs. While on tour in Germany he collapsed on stage. When Kelly was too ill to play, he was replaced by Seán Cannon. He continued to tour with the band until two months before his death. Kelly died on 30 January 1984. One of the last concerts in which he took part was recorded and released: &quot;Live in Carré&quot;, recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, released in 1983. In November 2004, the Dublin city council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly. Kelly is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.

Ciarán Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar and tin whistle. He sang many songs in Irish (&quot;Peggy Lettermore&quot;, &quot;Preab san Ól&quot;). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side. Bourke died in 1988. The band did not officially replace him until his death. 

John Sheahan and Bobby Lynch joined the band in 1964. They had been playing during the interval at concerts, and usually stayed on for the second half of the show. When Luke Kelly moved to England in 1964, Lynch was taken on as his temporary replacement. When Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. According to Sheahan, he was never (and still has not been) ever officially asked to join the band. Sheahan is the only member to have had a musical education. Lynch committed suicide in Dublin in 1982.

===Later changes and tours===

In 1996 Ronnie Drew quit the band, and Paddy Reilly came on to replace him. Reilly, a long-time friend of the group, toured with them before on several occasions; he was already a successful solo artist in Ireland, scoring hits with &quot;The Fields of Athenry&quot; and &quot;The Town I Loved So Well&quot;.

In 2005, Paddy Reilly moved to the United States, and Patsy Watchorn joined the group. Watchorn made a name for himself with The Dublin City Ramblers; like Kelly, he accompanies his songs on the five-string banjo.

The band toured Europe every year. A planned tour of Denmark two weeks after the death of McKenna on 5 April 2012 went ahead as planned. From the first show in Copenhagen on 18 April onwards he was replaced by the Irish banjo player Gerry O&#x27;Connor. In the autumn of 2012, the band announced their retirement, effective after their 50th anniversary shows at the end of the year. The Dubliners played their final shows at Vicar Street in Dublin on 28/29/30 December 2012, and made their final TV appearance in the UK on a pre-recorded New Year&#x27;s Eve edition of &quot;Jools Holland Annual Hootenanny&quot; on 31 December. Their last public appearance as the Dubliners was on 27 January 2013 in memory of Barney McKenna.

==Reunions==
===25th anniversary===
In 1987, The Dubliners celebrated their 25th anniversary. They recorded a double CD, produced by Eamonn Campbell, a long-time friend and guest musician. He introduced them to The Pogues, and their collaboration resulted in a hit with &quot;The Irish Rover&quot;. It reached number 8 in the UK singles charts and number 1 in Ireland. In 1990 their final hit single was &quot;Jack&#x27;s Heroes/Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, again with The Pogues, which reached number 63 in the UK and number 4 in Ireland. Campbell, who plays the guitar on stage, has been touring with the band ever since. Christy Moore, Paddy Reilly and Jim McCann also featured on the CD; Moore sings a tribute to Luke Kelly, and McCann sings the song &quot;I Loved the Ground She Walked Upon&quot;, written by Phil Coulter and Ralph McTell. The following year, to coincide with Dublin&#x27;s millennial celebrations, Raidió Teilifís Éireann produced an hour-long special on the band and the city&#x27;s influence on their music, titled &quot;The Dubliner&#x27;s Dublin&quot;.

===40th anniversary===
In 2003, they temporarily reunited with Ronnie Drew and Jim McCann, for their 40th anniversary tour. They made a string of appearances on Irish television throughout this time, including a memorable appearance with Phil Coulter and George Murphy on RTÉ 1.

After the tour, Jim McCann was diagnosed with throat cancer and, though he fully recovered, his voice was severely damaged, and he was unable to sing since his illness. Despite this, he regularly acted as MC at folk gigs, notably at The Dubliners reunion shows, and at the 2006 &#x27;Legends of Irish Folk&#x27; shows (where he also played guitar in the finale).

===50th anniversary===
In 2012 the band celebrated their 50th anniversary with an extensive year-long European tour and the release of a live DVD recorded live at Dublin&#x27;s Vicar Street featuring Chris Kavanagh from the Band &quot;The Legend of Luke Kelly&quot; as a special guest. The tour continued in the wake of the death of the final founding member Barney McKenna, although the band announced that the final shows of the tour, to be held 28–30 December also at Vicar Street would be the band&#x27;s final shows in which the band were joined by former band member Jim McCann.

==Success==
The Dubliners became well known, not just in Ireland but also as pioneers for Irish folk in Europe and also (though less successful) in the United States. Their 1967 recordings of &quot;Seven Drunken Nights&quot; and &quot;The Black Velvet Band&quot; were released on the fledgling Major Minor label, and were heavily promoted on pirate radio station Radio Caroline. The result was that both records reached the top 20 in the UK singles chart. A third single, &quot;Maids When You&#x27;re Young Never Wed an Old Man&quot; reached number 43 in December 1967. It was their last UK hit single till they recorded with The Pogues in 1987.

In 1974, Ronnie Drew decided to quit the band, to spend more time with his family. He was replaced with Jim McCann. Before joining the band McCann had a TV show in the early seventies called &quot;The McCann man&quot;. He is best known for his incarnations of &quot;Carrickfergus&quot;, Makem&#x27;s &quot;Four Green Fields&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;. He stayed with the band until 1979 when he left to start a solo career; then Ronnie Drew rejoined the band. First Ronnie went to Norway to record two songs in the Norwegian language with the Norwegian band Bergeners.

The Dubliners also gained popularity amongst famous musicians such as Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd&#x27;s drummer Nick Mason, who were all self-proclaimed Dubliners fans.

In the 1960s, The Dubliners sang rebel songs such as &quot;The Old Alarm Clock&quot;, &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot; and &quot;Off to Dublin in the Green&quot;. However, the conflict in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards led them to drop most of these from their repertoire. They resumed performing such songs occasionally towards the end of their career. They have also recorded satirical protest songs against nuclear weapons such as &quot;The Button Pusher&quot; and &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;, feminist songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Married&quot;, and socialist songs such as &quot;Joe Hill&quot;.

On 8 February 2012, The Dubliners received a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the 2012 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

<text>The Soviet Union introduced forced collectivization () of its agricultural sector between 1928 and 1940 during the ascension of Joseph Stalin. It began during and was part of the first five-year plan. The policy aimed to integrate individual landholdings and labour into nominally collectively-controlled and openly or directly state-controlled farms: &quot;Kolkhozes&quot; and &quot;Sovkhozes&quot; accordingly. The Soviet leadership confidently expected that the replacement of individual peasant farms by collective ones would immediately increase the food supply for the urban population, the supply of raw materials for the processing industry, and agricultural exports via state-imposed quotas on individuals working on collective farms. Planners regarded collectivization as the solution to the crisis of agricultural distribution (mainly in grain deliveries) that had developed from 1927. This problem became more acute as the Soviet Union pressed ahead with its ambitious industrialization program, meaning that more food would be needed to keep up with urban demand.

In October 1929, approximately 7.5% of the peasant households were in collective farms, and by February 1930, 52.7% had been collectivised. The collectivization era saw several famines, as well as peasant resistance to collectivization.

==Background==
During the period of war communism introduced during the Russian Civil War the policy of &quot;prodrazvyorstka&quot; was introduced (the same policy was used even before the October Revolution during World War I), which meant that the peasantry was obligated to surrender the surpluses of agricultural produce for a fixed price. When the Russian Civil War ended, the economy changed with the New Economic Policy (NEP) and specifically, with the replacement of prodrazvyorstka with less drastic &quot;prodnalog&quot; or &quot;food tax.&quot; 

Leon Trotsky and the Opposition bloc had advocated a programme of industrialization which also proposed agricultural cooperatives and the formation of collective farms on a voluntary basis. According to Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialization and collectivization. Other scholars have argued that the economic programme of Trotsky differed from the forced policy of collectivisation implemented by Stalin after 1928 due to the levels of brutality associated with its enforcement.

The pre-existing communes, which periodically redistributed land, did little to encourage improvement in technique and formed a source of power beyond the control of the Soviet government. Although the income gap between wealthy and poor farmers did grow under the NEP, it remained quite small, but the Bolsheviks began to take aim at the &quot;kulaks&quot;, peasants with enough land and money to own several animals and hire a few labourers . Kulaks were blamed for withholding surpluses of agricultural produce. Clearly identifying this group was difficult, though, since only about 1% of the peasantry employed labourers (the basic Marxist definition of a capitalist), and 82% of the country&#x27;s population were peasants. According to Robert Conquest, the definition of &quot;kulak&quot; also varied depending on who was using it; &quot;peasants with a couple of cows or five or six acres [~2 ha] more than their neighbors&quot; were labeled &quot;kulaks&quot;&quot; in Stalin&#x27;s first Five Year Plan.

The small shares of most of the peasants resulted in food shortages in the cities. Although grain had nearly returned to pre-war production levels, the large estates which had produced it for urban markets had been divided up. Not interested in acquiring money to purchase overpriced manufactured goods, the peasants chose to consume their produce rather than sell it. As a result, city dwellers only saw half the grain that had been available before the war. Before the revolution, peasants controlled only 2,100,000 km2 divided into 16 million holdings, producing 50% of the food grown in Russia and consuming 60% of total food production. After the revolution, the peasants controlled 3,140,000 km2 divided into 25 million holdings, producing 85% of the food, but consuming 80% of what they grew (meaning that they ate 68% of the total).

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union had never been happy with private agriculture and saw collectivization as the best remedy for the problem. Lenin claimed, &quot;Small-scale production gives birth to capitalism and the bourgeoisie constantly, daily, hourly, with elemental force, and in vast proportions.&quot; Apart from ideological goals, Joseph Stalin also wished to embark on a program of rapid heavy industrialization which required larger surpluses to be extracted from the agricultural sector in order to feed a growing industrial workforce and to pay for imports of machinery (by exporting grain). Social and ideological goals would also be served through the mobilization of the peasants in a co-operative economic enterprise that would provide social services to the people and empower the state. Stalin was suspicious of the peasants, viewing them as a major threat to socialism. Stalin&#x27;s use of the collectivization process served to not only address the grain shortages, but his greater concern over the peasants&#x27; willingness to conform to the collective farm system and state mandated grain acquisitions.

==Crisis of 1928==
This demand for more grain resulted in the reintroduction of requisitioning which was resisted in rural areas. In 1928 there was a 2-million-ton shortfall in grains purchased by the Soviet Union from neighbouring markets. Stalin claimed the grain had been produced but was being hoarded by &quot;kulaks.&quot; Stalin tried to appear as being on the side of the peasants, but it did not help, and the peasants as a whole resented the grain seizures. The peasants did everything they could to protest what they considered unfair seizures. Instead of raising the price, the Politburo adopted an emergency measure to requisition 2.5 million tons of grain.

The seizures of grain discouraged the peasants and less grain was produced during 1928, and again the government resorted to requisitions, much of the grain being requisitioned from middle peasants as sufficient quantities were not in the hands of the &quot;kulaks.&quot; The impact that this had on poorer peasants forced them to move to the cities. The peasants moved in search of jobs in the rapidly expanding industry. This, however, had a fairly negative impact upon their arrival as the peasants brought with them their habits from the farms. They struggled with punctuality and demonstrated a rather poor work ethic, which hindered their ability to perform in the workplace. In 1929, especially after the introduction of the Ural-Siberian Method of grain procurement, resistance to grain seizures became widespread with some violent incidents of resistance. Also, massive hoarding (burial was the common method) and illegal transfers of grain took place.

Faced with the refusal to hand grain over, a decision was made at a plenary session of the Central Committee in November 1929 to embark on a nationwide program of collectivization.

Several forms of collective farming were suggested by the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Agriculture (Narkomzem), distinguished according to the extent to which property was held in common:
*Association for Joint Cultivation of Land (Товарищество по совместной обработке земли, ТОЗ/TOZ), where only land was in common use;
*agricultural &quot;artel&quot; (initially in a loose meaning, later formalized to become an organizational basis of kolkhozes, via &quot;The Standard Statute of an Agricultural Artel&quot; adopted by Sovnarkom in March 1930);
*agricultural commune, with the highest level of common use of resources.
Also, various cooperatives for the processing of agricultural products were installed.

In November 1929, the Central Committee decided to implement accelerated collectivization in the form of kolkhozes and sovkhozes. This marked the end of the New Economic Policy (NEP), which had allowed peasants to sell their surpluses on the open market. Peasants that were willing to conform and join the kolkhozes were rewarded with higher quality land and tax breaks, whereas peasants were unwilling to join the kolkhozes were punished with being given lower quality land and increased taxes. The taxes imposed on the peasants was primarily to fund the industrial blitz that Stalin had made a priority. If these lesser forms of social coercion proved to be ineffective then the central government would resort to harsher forms of state coercion. Stalin had many kulaks transported to collective farms in distant places to work in agricultural labour camps. In response to this, many peasants began to resist, often began arming themselves against the activists sent from the towns. As a form of protest, many peasants preferred to slaughter their animals for food rather than give them over to collective farms, which produced a major reduction in livestock.

Collectivization had been encouraged since the revolution, but in 1928, only about 1% of farmland was collectivized, and despite efforts to encourage and coerce collectivization, the rather optimistic first five-year plan only forecast 15 per cent of farms to be run collectively.

==All-out drive, winter 1929–30==

The situation changed quickly in the autumn of 1929 and the winter of 1930. Between September and December 1929, collectivization increased from 7.4% to 15%, but in the first two months of 1930, 11 million households joined collectivized farms, pushing the total to nearly 60%.

To assist collectivization, the Party decided to send 25,000 &quot;socially conscious&quot; industry workers to the countryside. This was accomplished from 1929 to 1933, and these workers have become known as twenty-five-thousanders (&quot;dvadtsat&#x27;pyat&#x27;tysyachniki&quot;). Soviet officials had hoped that by sending the twenty-five thousanders to the countryside that they would be able to produce grain more rapidly. Their hopes were that key areas in the North Caucasus and Volga regions would be collectivized by 1931, and then the other regions by 1932.

Collectivization sought to modernize Soviet agriculture, consolidating the land into parcels that could be farmed by modern equipment using the latest scientific methods of agriculture. It was often claimed that an American Fordson tractor (called &quot;Фордзон&quot; in Russian) was the best propaganda in favour of collectivization. 

The agricultural means of production (land, equipment, livestock) were to be totally &quot;commonalised&quot; (&quot;обобществлены&quot;), i.e. removed from the control of individual peasant households.

==&quot;Dizzy with Success&quot;==

The zeal for collectivization was so high that the March 2, 1930, issue of &quot;Pravda&quot; contained Stalin&#x27;s article &quot;Dizzy with Success (&quot;), in which he called for a temporary halt to the process:

It is a fact that by February 20 of this year 50 percent of the peasant farms throughout the U.S.S.R. had been collectivized. That means that by February 20, 1930, we had &quot;overfulfilled&quot; the five-year plan of collectivization by more than 100 per cent... some of our comrades have become dizzy with success and for the moment have lost clearness of mind and sobriety of vision.

After the publication of the article, the pressure for collectivization temporarily abated and peasants started leaving collective farms. By 1930 only 23.6% of peasants were collective farms, i.e., the numbers dropped by 50%. But soon collectivization was intensified again. In particular, March 1931 decrees &quot;О совхозном строительстве&quot; and &quot;О колхозном строительстве&quot; forbade peasants to leave collective farms. By 1936, about 90% of Soviet agriculture was collectivized.

Later a number of authors suggested that this Stalin&#x27;s article was picking scapegoats, putting the blame on rank-and-file functionaries for his own excesses and quenching the rising discontent.

==Peasants&#x27; resistance==
Stalin&#x27;s efforts to implement agricultural collectivization played a significant role in the overall mortality figures attributed to his regime, notably evidenced by the Ukrainian famine, a single famine responsible for 3 to 5 million deaths. Some peasants viewed collectivization as the end of the world. By no means was joining the collective farm (also known as the kolkhoz) voluntary. The drive to collectivize understandably had little support from experienced farmers.

The oversimplified intent was to withhold grain from the market and increase the total crop and food supply via state collective farms, with the surplus funding future industrialization. The kulaks were coerced into giving up their land to make way for these collective farms or risk being killed, deported, or sent to labor camps. Inexperienced peasants from urban areas would then replace the missing workforce of the agriculture sector, which was then considered overstaffed, inefficient and import-dependent. Under Stalin&#x27;s grossly inefficient system, agricultural yields declined rather than increased. 

To make matters worse, tractors promised to the peasants could not be produced due to the poor policies in the Industrial sector of the Soviet Union.

When quotas were not met, Stalin enforced collectivization by sending special regimes to confiscate any food they can find. The kulaks argued to the collectors that starvation was inevitable, but they still seized everything edible from the kulaks to make up for the quotas, regardless of whether the kulaks had anything for themselves. Although there were recorded instances of people hiding food, this was out of survival. One notable instance was a mother hiding flour under her baby&#x27;s cradle. When the brigade found it, she cried and beg saying her baby would die of hunger without it. The brigade took it anyway. Stalin falsely denied there even was a famine and prohibited journalists from visiting the collective farms. In order to cover up for the poor harvests, the Soviet government created a fierce propaganda campaign blaming the kulaks for the famine. The propaganda said they were creating an artificial food shortage by hiding crops only to sell them when prices were high. 

===Collectivization as a &quot;second serfdom&quot;===
Rumors circulated in the villages warning the rural residents that collectivization would bring disorder, hunger, famine, and the destruction of crops and livestock. Readings and reinterpretations of Soviet newspapers labelled collectivization as a second serfdom. Villagers were afraid the old landowners/serf owners were coming back and that the villagers joining the collective farm would face starvation and famine. More reason for peasants to believe collectivization was a second serfdom was that entry into the kolkhoz had been forced. Farmers did not have the right to leave the collective without permission. The level of state procurements and prices on crops also enforced the serfdom analogy. The government would take a majority of the crops and pay extremely low prices. The serfs during the 1860s were paid nothing but collectivization still reminded the peasants of serfdom. To them, this &quot;second serfdom&quot; became code for the Communist betrayal of the revolution. To the peasants, the revolution was about giving more freedom and land to the peasants, but instead, they had to give up themselves, with any land or livestock they had to the centrally controlled ‘collective farm’ in accordance with the state&#x27;s policies.

===Women&#x27;s role in resistance===
Women were the primary vehicle for rumours that touched upon issues of family and everyday life. Fears that collectivization would result in the socialization of children, the export of women&#x27;s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumours without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm &quot;under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.&quot; Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.

Peasant women were rarely held accountable for their actions because of the officials&#x27; perceptions of their protests. They &quot;physically blocked the entrances to huts of peasants scheduled to be exiled as kulaks, forcibly took back socialized seed and livestock and led assaults on officials.&quot; Officials ran away and hid to let the riots run their course. When women came to trial, they were given less harsh punishments as the men because women, to officials, were seen as illiterate and the most backward part of the peasantry. One particular case of this was a riot in a Russian village of Belovka where protestors were beating members of the local soviet and setting fire to their homes. The men were held exclusively responsible as the main culprits. Women were given sentences to serve as a warning, not as a punishment. Because of how they were perceived, women were able to play an essential role in the resistance to collectivization.

===Religious persecution===
Collectivization did not just entail the acquisition of land from farmers but also the closing of churches, burning of icons, and the arrests of priests. Associating the church with the tsarist regime, the Soviet state continued to undermine the church through expropriations and repression. They cut off state financial support to the church and secularized church schools. Peasants began to associate Communists with atheists because the attack on the church was so devastating. The Communist assault on religion and the church angered many peasants, giving them more reason to revolt. Riots exploded after the closing of churches as early as 1929.

Identification of Soviet power with the Antichrist also decreased peasant support for the Soviet regime. Rumors about religious persecution spread mostly by word of mouth, but also through leaflets and proclamations. Priests preached that the Antichrist had come to place &quot;the Devil&#x27;s mark&quot; on the peasants and that the Soviet state was promising the peasants a better life but was actually signing them up for Hell. Peasants feared that if they joined the collective farm they would be marked with the stamp of the Antichrist. They faced a choice between God and the Soviet collective farm. Choosing between salvation and damnation, peasants had no choice but to resist the policies of the state. These rumours of the Soviet state as the Antichrist functioned to keep peasants from succumbing to the government. The attacks on religion and the Church affected women the most because they were upholders of religion within the villages.

Dovzhenko&#x27;s film &quot;Earth&quot; gives example of peasants&#x27; skepticism with collectivization on the basis that it was an attack on the church. Coiner of the term genocide, Raphael Lemkin, considered the repression of the Orthodox Church to be a prong of genocide against Ukrainians when seen in correlation to the Holodomor famine.

==Results==
===Consequences===


Due to the high government production quotas, peasants received, as a rule, less for their labour than they did before collectivization, and some refused to work. Merle Fainsod estimated that, in 1952, collective farm earnings were only one-fourth of the cash income from private plots on Soviet collective farms. In many cases, the immediate effect of collectivization was the reduction of output and the cutting of the number of livestock in half. The subsequent recovery of the agricultural production was also impeded by the losses suffered by the Soviet Union during World War II and the severe drought of 1946. However, the largest loss of livestock was caused by collectivization for all animals except pigs. The numbers of cows in the USSR fell from 33.2 million in 1928 to 27.8 million in 1941 and to 24.6 million in 1950. The number of pigs fell from 27.7 million in 1928 to 27.5 million in 1941 and then to 22.2 million in 1950. The number of sheep fell from 114.6 million in 1928 to 91.6 million in 1941 and to 93.6 million in 1950. The number of horses fell from 36.1 million in 1928 to 21.0 million in 1941 and to 12.7 million in 1950. Only by the late 1950s did Soviet farm animal stocks begin to approach 1928 levels. Peasant slaughter of livestock was significant, for instance in the Central Black Earth Region 25% of cattle, 55% of sheep, 53% of pigs and 40% of chickens were slaughtered within the first three months of 1930.

Despite the initial plans, collectivization, accompanied by the bad harvest of 1932–1933, did not live up to expectations. Between 1929 and 1932 there was a massive fall in agricultural production resulting in famine in the countryside. Stalin and the CPSU blamed the prosperous peasants, referred to as &#x27;kulaks&#x27; (Russian: &quot;fist&quot;), who were organizing resistance to collectivization. Allegedly, many kulaks had been hoarding grain in order to speculate on higher prices, thereby sabotaging grain collection. Stalin resolved to eliminate them as a class. The methods Stalin used to eliminate the kulaks were dispossession, deportation, and execution. The term &quot;Ural-Siberian Method&quot; was coined by Stalin, the rest of the population referred to it as the &quot;new method&quot;. Article 107 of the criminal code was the legal means by which the state acquired grain.

The Soviet government responded to these acts by cutting off food rations to peasants and areas where there was opposition to collectivization, especially in Ukraine. For peasants that were unable to meet the grain quota, they were fined five-times the quota. If the peasant continued to be defiant the peasants&#x27; property and equipment would be confiscated by the state. If none of the previous measures were effective the defiant peasant would be deported or exiled. The practice was made legal in 1929 under Article 61 of the criminal code. Many peasant families were forcibly resettled in Siberia and Kazakhstan into exile settlements, and some of them died on the way. Estimates suggest that about a million so-called &#x27;kulak&#x27; families, or perhaps some 5 million people, were sent to forced labour camps.

On August 7, 1932, the &quot;Decree about the Protection of Socialist Property&quot; proclaimed that the punishment for theft of kolkhoz or cooperative property was the death sentence, which &quot;under extenuating circumstances&quot; could be replaced by at least ten years of incarceration. With what some called the &quot;Law of Spikelets&quot; (&quot;Закон о колосках&quot;), peasants (including children) who hand-collected or gleaned grain in the collective fields after the harvest were arrested for damaging the state grain production.

During the Famine of 1932–33 it&#x27;s estimated that 5.7 to 8.7 million people died from starvation. The implication is that the total death toll (both direct and indirect) for Stalin&#x27;s collectivization program was on the order of 12 million people. There is a popular story that at the 1945 Yalta Conference when Winston Churchill asked Joseph Stalin how many died in the famine, the Soviet leader responded with a shrug, a gesture that on account of Stalin&#x27;s raised hands having 10 fingers, has been cited by historians as a direct admission that ten million people perished as a result of collectivization.

===Siberia===

Since the second half of the 19th century, Siberia had been a major agricultural region within Russia, espеcially its southern territories (nowadays Altai Krai, Omsk Oblast, Novosibirsk Oblast, Kemerovo Oblast, Khakassia, Buryatia, Irkutsk Oblast). Stolypin&#x27;s program of resettlement granted a lot of land for immigrants from elsewhere in the empire, creating a large portion of well-off peasants and stimulating rapid agricultural development in the 1910s. Local merchants exported large quantities of labelled grain, flour, and butter into central Russia and Western Europe.
In May 1931, a special resolution of the Western-Siberian Regional Executive Committee (classified &quot;top secret&quot;) ordered the expropriation of property and the deportation of 40,000 kulaks to &quot;sparsely populated and unpopulated&quot; areas in Tomsk Oblast in the northern part of the Western-Siberian region. The expropriated property was to be transferred to kolkhozes as indivisible collective property and the kolkhoz shares representing this forced contribution of the deportees to kolkhoz equity were to be held in the &quot;collectivization fund of poor and landless peasants&quot; (фонд коллективизации бедноты и батрачества). A notable uprising against collectivisation in Siberia occurred in Buryatia, where a revolt was put down by the Red Army in 1929.

It has since been perceived by historians such as Lynne Viola as a Civil War of the peasants against the Bolshevik Government and the attempted colonization of the countryside.

===Central Asia and Kazakhstan===

In 1928 within Soviet Kazakhstan, authorities started a campaign to confiscate cattle from richer Kazakhs, who were called bai, known as Little October. The confiscation campaign was carried out by Kazakhs against other Kazakhs, and it was up to those Kazakhs to decide who was a bai and how much to confiscate from them. This engagement was intended to make Kazakhs active participants in the transformation of Kazakh society. More than 10,000 bais may have been deported due to the campaign against them. In areas where the major agricultural activity was nomadic herding, collectivization met with massive resistance and major losses and confiscation of livestock. Livestock in Kazakhstan fell from 7 million cattle to 1.6 million and from 22 million sheep to 1.7 million. Restrictions on migration proved ineffective and half a million migrated to other regions of Central Asia and 1.5 million to China. Of those who remained, as many as a million died in the resulting famine. In Mongolia, a so-called &#x27;Soviet dependency&#x27;, attempted collectivization was abandoned in 1932 after the loss of 8 million head of livestock.

Historian Sarah Cameron argues that while Stalin did not intend to starve Kazakhs, he saw some deaths as a necessary sacrifice to achieve the political and economic goals of the regime. Cameron believes that while the famine combined with a campaign against nomads was not genocide in the sense of the United Nations (UN) definition, it complies with Raphael Lemkin&#x27;s original concept of genocide, which considered destruction of culture to be as genocidal as physical annihilation. Historian Stephen Wheatcroft criticized this view in regard to the Soviet famine because he believes that the nominally stated high expectations of central planners was sufficient to demonstrate their ignorance of the ultimate consequences of their actions and that the result of them would be famine. Niccolò Pianciola goes further than Cameron and argues that from Lemkin&#x27;s point of view on genocide all nomads of the Soviet Union were victims of the crime, not just the Kazakhs.

===Ukraine===
Most historians agree that the disruption caused by collectivization and the resistance of the peasants significantly contributed to the Great Famine of 1932–1933, especially in Ukraine, a region famous for its rich soil (chernozem). This particular period is called &quot;Holodomor&quot; in Ukrainian. During the similar famines of 1921–1923, numerous campaigns – inside the country, as well as internationally – were held to raise money and food in support of the population of the affected regions. Nothing similar was done during the drought of 1932–1933, mainly because the information about the disaster was suppressed by Stalin. Stalin also undertook a purge of the Ukrainian communists and intelligentsia, with devastating long-term effects on the area. Many Ukrainian villages were blacklisted and penalized by government decree for perceived sabotage of food supplies. Moreover, migration of population from the affected areas was restricted. According to Stalin in his conversation with the prize-winning writer Mikhail Sholokhov, the famine was caused by the excesses of local party workers and sabotage,
I&#x27;ve thanked you for the letters, as they expose a sore in our Party-Soviet work and show how our workers, wishing to curb the enemy, sometimes unwittingly hit friends and descend to sadism. ... the esteemed grain-growers of your district (and not only of your district alone) carried on an &#x27;Italian strike&#x27; (sabotage!) and were not loath to leave the workers and the Red Army without bread. That the sabotage was quiet and outwardly harmless (without blood) does not change the fact that the esteemed grain-growers waged what was in fact a &#x27;quiet&#x27; war against Soviet power. A war of starvation, dear com[rade] Sholokhov. This, of course, can in no way justify the outrages, which, as you assure me, have been committed by our workers. ... And those guilty of those outrages must be duly punished.
About 40 million people were affected by the food shortages including areas near Moscow where mortality rates increased by 50%. The center of the famine, however, was Ukraine and surrounding regions, including the Don, the Kuban, the Northern Caucasus and Kazakhstan where the toll was one million dead. The countryside was affected more than cities, but 120,000 died in Kharkiv, 40,000 in Krasnodar and 20,000 in Stavropol.

Whilst there is no comprehensive official account of famine deaths known of, historians R. W. Davies and Stephen G. Wheatcroft used official archival soviet &#x27;registered death&#x27; statistics of 2,577,065 deaths from all causes in Ukraine to extrapolate an &#x27;excess registered mortality&#x27; of 1,544,840 from 1932 to 1933. Alec Nove claims that registration of deaths largely ceased in many areas during the famine. However, it&#x27;s been pointed out that the registered deaths in the archives were substantially revised by the demographics officials. The older version of the data showed 600,000 fewer deaths in Ukraine than the current, revised statistics. In &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;, the authors claim that the number of deaths was at least 4 million, and they also characterize the Great Famine as &quot;a genocide of the Ukrainian people&quot;.

===Latvia===
After the Soviet Occupation of Latvia in June 1940, the country&#x27;s new rulers were faced with a problem: the agricultural reforms of the inter-war period had expanded individual holdings. The property of &quot;enemies of the people&quot; and refugees, as well as those above 30 hectares, was nationalized in 1940–44, but those who were still landless were then given plots of 15 hectares each. Thus, Latvian agriculture remained essentially dependent on personal smallholdings, making central planning difficult. In 1940–41 the Communist Party repeatedly said that collectivization would not occur forcibly, but rather voluntarily and by example. To encourage collectivization high taxes were enforced and new farms were given no government support. But after 1945 the Party dropped its restrained approach as the voluntary approach was not yielding results. Latvians were accustomed to individual holdings (&quot;viensētas&quot;), which had existed even during serfdom, and for many farmers, the plots awarded to them by the interwar reforms were the first their families had ever owned. Furthermore, the countryside was filled with rumours regarding the harshness of collective farm life.

Pressure from Moscow to collectivize continued and the authorities in Latvia sought to reduce the number of individual farmers (increasingly labelled &quot;kulaki&quot; or &quot;budži&quot;) through higher taxes and requisitioning of agricultural products for state use. The first kolkhoz was established only in November 1946 and by 1948, just 617 kolkhozes had been established, integrating 13,814 individual farmsteads (12.6% of the total). The process was still judged too slow, and in March 1949 just under 13,000 kulak families, as well as a large number of individuals, were identified. Between March 24 and March 30, 1949, about 40,000 people were deported and resettled at various points throughout the USSR.

After these deportations, the pace of collectivization increased as a flood of farmers rushed into kolkhozes. Within two weeks 1740 new kolkhozes were established and by the end of 1950, just 4.5% of Latvian farmsteads remained outside the collectivized units; about 226,900 farmsteads belonged to collectives, of which there were now around 14,700. Rural life changed as farmers&#x27; daily movements were governed by plans, decisions, and quotas formulated elsewhere and delivered through an intermediate non-farming hierarchy. The new kolkhozes, especially smaller ones, were ill-equipped and poor – at first farmers were paid once a year in kind and then in cash, but salaries were very small and at times farmers went unpaid or even ended up owing money to the kolkhoz. Farmers still had small pieces of land (not larger than 0.5 ha) around their houses where they grew food for themselves. Along with collectivization, the government tried to uproot the custom of living in individual farmsteads by resettling people in villages. However this process failed due to lack of money since the Soviets planned to move houses as well.

== Progress of collectivization, 1927–1940 ==

The official numbers for the collectivized areas (the column with per cent of sown area in collective use in the table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as a per cent of sown area in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on the total sown area (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935 and 1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of kolkhoz members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) are included in the land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of sown areas.

==Decollectivization under German occupation==
During World War II, Alfred Rosenberg, in his capacity as the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms in areas of the USSR under German occupation. He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming, restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivization conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and Hermann Göring demanded that the &quot;kolkhoz&quot; be retained, save for a change of name. Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as &#x27;stupid.&#x27; In the end, the German occupation authorities retained most of the kolkhozes and simply renamed them &quot;community farms&quot; (, a throwback to the traditional Russian commune). German propaganda described this as a preparatory step toward the ultimate dissolution of the kolkhozes into private farms, which would be granted to peasants who had loyally delivered compulsory quotas of farm produce to the Germans. By 1943, the German occupation authorities had converted 30% of the kolkhozes into German-sponsored &quot;agricultural cooperatives&quot;, but as yet had made no conversions to private farms.

<text>Dumbo (or DUMBO, an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It encompasses two sections: one situated between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, which connect Brooklyn to Manhattan across the East River, and another extending eastward from the Manhattan Bridge to the Vinegar Hill area. The neighborhood is bounded by Brooklyn Bridge Park to the north, the Brooklyn Bridge to the west, Brooklyn Heights to the south, and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of Brooklyn Community Board 2.

Dumbo has historically been known by several names, including Gairville, Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville. The area was originally a ferry landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, Belgian block streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. A large number of the buildings in Dumbo were bought by developer David Walentas and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art galleries, and currently a center for technology startups.

Dumbo earned the nickname &quot;the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle&quot; thanks to its thriving community of tech startups. This designation coincided with its rise to become Brooklyn&#x27;s most affluent neighborhood and the fourth-wealthiest community in New York City; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology startups, its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious luxury residential lofts. The neighborhood contains the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer Etsy and home furnishing stores company West Elm.

==History==

The name is an acronym of &quot;Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass&quot;. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville; the developer who began its current gentrification is Two Trees Management, led at the time by David Walentas. The &quot;Olympia&quot; name came from Comfort and Joshua Sands, who bought the land in 1787 and were planning to develop the land as a summer place for New Yorkers. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, the area now known as Dumbo was considered part of Vinegar Hill.

In the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as Fulton Landing, after the ferry stop that connected it to Manhattan before the Brooklyn Bridge opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes, spices and Brillo soap pads. The cardboard box was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair&#x27;s fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time. The Gair building is now home to Etsy.

The Jay Street Connecting Railroad ran through Dumbo&#x27;s waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a car float bridge on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars. The tracks were abandoned in 1959, though the railroad&#x27;s tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo. In 1968, there was a proposal to relocate the Fort Greene Meat Market to Dumbo, though the market was ultimately moved to Sunset Park instead.

With the deindustrialization of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive loft apartment spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s. The acronym &quot;Dumbo&quot; arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.

Near the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly gentrified. Even so, the acronym &quot;Dumbo&quot; was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the East River and under the Manhattan Bridge. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and &quot;seedy back alleys and wharves&quot;; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or laundromat. The efforts of Joy Glidden, the Founding Director of the Dumbo Arts Center (DAC) and co-founder of the Dumbo Art Under the Bridge Festival, achieved successful development in Dumbo, which is now a model for similar waterfront developments around the world. Glidden stated of Dumbo&#x27;s gentrification, &quot;It may be one of the last of what could be considered a true arts community in New York.&quot;

The DUMBO Historic District, a historic industrial complex and national historic district in Dumbo, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It consists of 95 contributing buildings; the manufacturing concerns located in this district included Benjamin Moore &amp; Co. (paint), Arbuckle Brothers (coffee and sugar), J.W. Masury &amp; Son (paint), Robert Gair (paper boxes), E.W. Bliss (machinery), and Brillo (soap pads). The district includes the earliest large-scale reinforced concrete factory buildings in America. On December 18, 2007, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to designate Dumbo as the city&#x27;s 90th historic district. The Dumbo historic district consists of properties bounded by John Street to the north, York Street to the south, Main Street to the west, and Bridge Street to the east.

==Land use==

===Art, business, and leisure===
The area has emerged as one of New York City&#x27;s premier arts districts, with a cluster of for-profit art galleries such as the Klompching Gallery, and such not-for-profit institutions as the St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse the A.I.R. Gallery and the first post-COVID-19 performance venue to open in the area The Rat NYC (May 2024).

Chef Jacques Torres opened a chocolate factory in Dumbo in December 2000. Other culinary businesses in the area include Grimaldi&#x27;s, Ample Hills Creamery, Almondine Bakery, and the River Café, all clustered in Fulton Landing, also home to Bargemusic, a floating venue for classical music. John Fluevog, a Canadian shoe designer, opened a store on Main Street in November 2017.

The first public space in the neighborhood was Fulton Ferry, followed by Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park. The first six acres of Brooklyn Bridge Park, a joint state/city venture under development, were opened in March 2010. The Cliffs at DUMBO is a 7,800 square foot outdoor climbing gym located in the Main Street section of Brooklyn Bridge Park, and is the largest outdoor bouldering gym in North America.

The building at 200 Water Street, which the Brillo Manufacturing Co. once occupied, is being renovated as a high-end condo building.

The DUMBO Archway is a popular location for film shoots, art exhibitions, live music, large-scale events, and watch parties for events like the World Cup. The trailer for &quot;Joker&quot;, the 2019 film by Todd Phillips, features actor Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker running through the archway. The Archway also hosts the Brooklyn Flea every Sunday from April to October. The outdoor market features 80 vendors, and the products range from secondhand goods to custom-made jewelry.

Gleason&#x27;s Gym, located on Water Street, is the oldest boxing gym in New York. Many champions have trained there, including Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson. The gym has been located in DUMBO since the 1980s. It moved from 77 Front Street to its current location at 130 Water Street in 2016. The legendary boxing coach Hector Roca still teaches at the Water Street location. In addition to boxing champions, Roca has trained many actors, including Wesley Snipes, Hilary Swank, Jennifer Lopez, and John Leguizamo.

The renovation of Empire Stores on Water Street was completed in 2017. Previously, it had been a Civil War era coffee warehouse. It was converted to mixed-use retail and office space, and it includes West Elm&#x27;s global flagship store. Other retailers in Empire Stores include Detroit-based watchmaker Shinola and the café and accessories store, FEED Projects. In May 2017, the Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) opened a new branch in Empire Stores (its main location is in Brooklyn Heights). BHS features exhibits and artifacts relating to DUMBO&#x27;s industrial past. In May 2019, Time Out Market opened in Empire Stores. The food hall features 21 local vendors, including the Breads Bakery and DUMBO&#x27;s renowned pizzeria, Juliana&#x27;s.


===Tech hub===

Dumbo has New York City&#x27;s highest concentration of technology firms by neighborhood. Dumbo is home to 25 percent of New York City-based tech firms. Within a 10-block radius are 500 tech and creative firms that employ over 10,000 people. It also contains the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer Etsy and home furnishing stores company West Elm.
The City of New York, in conjunction with New York University, installed an incubator in Dumbo to support development of tech start-ups. Dumbo&#x27;s average office rent of US$25 per square foot ($269/m2) made it (as of 2013) more attractive to start-ups than Manhattan, where rents averaged $40 per square foot ($431/m2) in 2013.

===Housing===
The neighborhood contains the Farragut Houses, a group of ten towers managed by the New York City Housing Authority.

== Transportation ==
New York City Subway stations are located at York Street () on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, and High Street () on the IND Eighth Avenue Line. New York City Bus service is provided by the .

Ramps and staircases connect the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge walkways to Dumbo.

In June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River. On May 1, 2017, that route became part of the NYC Ferry&#x27;s East River route, which runs between Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing in Murray Hill, Manhattan, with five intermediate stops in Brooklyn and Queens. One of the East River Ferry&#x27;s stops is at Fulton Ferry in Dumbo.

== Education ==

=== Public library ===

The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL)&#x27;s Adams Street branch is located at 9 Adams Street, between John and Plymouth Streets. The Adams Street branch, designed by WORKac, occupies a former factory. The branch started construction in 2020 and cost $7 million to build. It opened in October 2021 and was the first BPL branch to open in Brooklyn since 1983.

<doc id="635618" wikidata="Q5262872" url="?curid=635618" title="Cultural Quarter, Northampton">
<text>The Cultural Quarter of the town Northampton, England, is a local council initiative to promote the area of the town centre which contains the theatre and museum. Part of it was referred to as Derngate, the name of a gate in the old town walls.

The re-branding was launched in early 2013. It encompasses the Northampton Museum, theatre complex Royal &amp; Derngate, a historic house 78 Derngate, an art gallery NN Contemporary Art and a cinema, the Errol Flynn Filmhouse. Bars, restaurants, pubs, hair salons and fashion shops, housing and offices are included. Northampton High School for Girls was once located in the zone. Its site has since been sold for housing.

==78 Derngate==

78 Derngate is a Grade II* Listed Georgian house, noted for its interior, which was extensively redeveloped in 1916-7 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for local businessman and modelmaker, Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke. It has been open to the public since 2003.

==Errol Flynn Filmhouse==
The Errol Flynn Filmhouse opened in June 2013, named after actor Errol Flynn, who worked at Northampton&#x27;s Royal Theatre in his early career. The 88-seat venue, in Albion Place, is part of the Royal &amp; Derngate theatre complex. It screens art-house, world films and documentaries alongside some mainstream films. The development was part of the Northampton Alive regeneration project.

==Northampton Museum and Art Gallery==

Northampton Museum and Art Gallery dates back to 1884. It was refurbished in 2012.

==NN Contemporary Art==

NN is an independent contemporary art space in the centre of Northampton. The gallery works with artists at all stages of their careers to present an international programme of contemporary art and multi-disciplinary events.
The gallery is run by the Northampton Arts Collective, which moved in 2012 from the old Fishmarket, later demolished to make way for a new bus station. NN Cafe, a café and performance venue, opened upstairs in October 2013 and ran until 2016. The Artist Table took on the Cafe space opening in spring 2017. In 2014 NN was awarded charitable status by the charities commission. and was awarded National Portfolio Organisation status by Arts Council England in June 2017 for the period 2018–22.

In 2003 a group of artists and practitioners came together to form Northampton Arts Collective (NAC). The group&#x27;s first flagship project was Fishmarket, which launched in 2006 as an independently run, not-for-profit visual arts space in the former abandoned Fishmarket building off the market square in central Northampton. This building housed the largest gallery space outside a city in the UK, alongside retail units and café. From 2006–2011 it presented changing exhibitions of contemporary art featuring artists such as Jamie Shovlin, Bill Drummond, and CJ Mahony, and interdisciplinary events including music and spoken word performances by artists such as Alan Moore, Lyric Lounge, and Don Letts.

NAC now forms the board for NN in the new space at Number Nine, which is run by curatorial and operational staff.

The NN Contemporary Art space is to move into new facilities at 24 Guildhall Road, former offices used by Northamptonshire County Council.

==Royal &amp; Derngate==
Royal &amp; Derngate is a theatre complex which is formed of the Royal Theatre, a 583-seat producing house, and the Derngate Theatre, a 1,200-set multi-purpose performance space. The Royal opened in 1884, followed 99 years later by the Derngate in 1983, which was built on the site of Northampton&#x27;s former Derngate bus station. The two theatres merged as one organisation in 1999, closed in 2005 to undergo an 18-month £14.5m redevelopment, and re-opened as Royal &amp; Derngate in 2006. &quot;The Stage&quot; hailed Royal &amp; Derngate as the Regional Theatre of the Year (2010) in its inaugural Stage 100 Awards for &quot;its artistic quality and connections it has with local audiences.&quot;

The building is on the site of a former open air car park and prior to that the Northampton St. John&#x27;s Street railway station, part of the former Bedford to Northampton Line.

A new Premier Inn hotel was built in Albion Place in 2015 and opened in 2016. Two properties adjacent to Royal &amp; Derngate are set to be turned into a hotel and restaurant. Newspaper House on Derngate is expected to be turned into luxury flats.

Several previously industrial buildings will be turned into a &#x27;Vulcan Works&#x27;. Work on the project started in 2015 and is expected to be finished in 2017.
A project to construct more headquarters for Northamptonshire County Council started in February 2015. It is expected to be finished in 2016.

<doc id="635620" wikidata="Q319336" url="?curid=635620" title="Stephon Marbury">
<text>Stephon Xavier Marbury (born February 20, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player who was also the head coach for the Beijing Royal Fighters of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) from 2019-2023. After his freshman year with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, he was selected as the 4th overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, but was traded shortly thereafter to the Minnesota Timberwolves. A two-time All-Star and two-time member of the All-NBA Team, Marbury played in the NBA from 1996 until 2009. He then played in the CBA until his retirement in 2018. During his time in the CBA, Marbury won three CBA championships, winning Finals MVP in 2015, and made three CBA All-Star Games.

Marbury and a young Kevin Garnett led the team to three straight playoff appearances from 1996-1999 with Minnesota. Jealous of Garnett&#x27;s contract, Marbury demanded a trade and was dealt to the New Jersey Nets, where he made his first All-Star and All-NBA Team. He was then traded to the Phoenix Suns where he made another All-Star Team in 2003. He was then dealt to his hometown team New York Knicks where he became hated, leading him to leave the NBA for the Chinese CBA, where he became a superstar.

==Early years==
Marbury has often gone by the nickname &quot;Starbury&quot;, a name created during his youth. Marbury, the sixth of seven children, was born and raised in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. He attended elementary school, PS 329. During his teenage years, he starred at NYC powerhouse Abraham Lincoln High School, After his senior year Marbury was named New York State Mr. Basketball, after averaging 27.4 points, 8.3 assists and 3 steals per game. He was often heralded as the next great NYC point guard, expected to follow the success of NBA stand-outs Mark Jackson and Kenny Anderson.

While still attending Abraham Lincoln High School he was one of the subjects of Darcy Frey&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Shot&quot;, which followed three seniors and Marbury, a freshman, through the early months of his first season with the school&#x27;s team. In high school, he played for the AAU team the New York Gauchos.

==College==

===Recruitment===
He was named a 1995 McDonald&#x27;s All-American along with future NBA All-Stars Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, and Antawn Jamison. Marbury was listed as one of the top five recruits in the country that year and was pursued by Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets coach Bobby Cremins, with whom he eventually committed.

===Georgia Tech===
At Georgia Tech, Marbury took over the starting point guard role left vacant with Travis Best&#x27;s departure. Teaming with future NBA players Matt Harpring and Drew Barry, Marbury led Georgia Tech to a 24–12 record en route to the Regional Semi-final game of the NCAA tournament, where the Yellow Jackets lost to Cincinnati 87–70. For the season, Marbury averaged 18.9 ppg and 4.5 assists and was named a Third Team All American by the Associated Press, along with several conference honors. Following the season he declared himself eligible for the 1996 NBA draft.

==Professional career==

===Minnesota Timberwolves (1996–1999)===
He was selected fourth overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1996 NBA draft, then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the draft rights to Ray Allen (who was drafted immediately after him) and a future first-round pick. In his first season in the league, Marbury averaged 15.8 points and 7.8 assists per game and was named to the 1997 All-Rookie Team. He and second-year player Kevin Garnett led the Timberwolves to the NBA playoffs in 1997 and 1998. During the 1997 NBA Playoffs, Marbury led Minnesota in scoring with 28 points during a first round Game 1 loss to the Houston Rockets.

During the lockout-shortened 1999 season, Marbury&#x27;s agent, David Falk, demanded a trade. Marbury said he wanted to be closer to his family and friends. Other reports said he wanted to go to a market that would provide more endorsement opportunities, while others suggested that Marbury genuinely disliked Minnesota and was jealous of Kevin Garnett&#x27;s new contract. Marbury was ultimately traded to the New Jersey Nets, alongside Bill Curley and Chris Carr of the Timberwolves and Elliot Perry of the Milwaukee Bucks in a three-way trade where the Timberwolves acquired Terrell Brandon, Brian Evans and draft considerations and the Bucks acquired Sam Cassell and Chris Gatling.

===New Jersey Nets (1999–2001)===
While in New Jersey, Marbury blossomed into an All-Star. Marbury made the All-NBA 3rd Team in 2000 and was selected as a reserve for the 2001 All-Star Game, where he hit 2 clutch threes to win the game. Marbury also scored a career-high 50 points on February 13, 2001, in an overtime loss against the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite his individual accolades, the Nets never made the playoffs during Marbury&#x27;s time with the team.

===Phoenix Suns (2001–2004)===
Marbury was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Johnny Newman and Soumaila Samake in the 2001 offseason for Jason Kidd and Chris Dudley. On November 30, 2002, Marbury scored a season-high 43 points, including 26 in the 4th quarter, to lead the Suns to a 94–87 win over the San Antonio Spurs. As a Sun, Marbury made his second All-Star team and the All-NBA 3rd team in 2003. Teamed with Rookie of the Year Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire and All-Star Shawn Marion, the trio took the team to the 2003 NBA playoffs, but the Suns were ousted by the Spurs in the first round.

===New York Knicks (2004–2009)===

Marbury, Penny Hardaway and Cezary Trybański were traded to the New York Knicks on January 5, 2004, for Howard Eisley, Charlie Ward, Antonio McDyess, Maciej Lampe, draft rights to Miloš Vujanić, a first-round 2004 draft choice, and an additional future first-round draft choice. This brought Marbury full circle, as he grew up in New York and was a lifelong Knicks fan.

Marbury played for the U.S. in the 2004 Summer Olympics, the first of the U.S. teams composed of NBA players to fail to win the gold medal at the Olympics. He and his teammates returned with bronze. Despite the disappointment, Marbury scored a U.S. team Olympic record 31 points in a game against Spain (since eclipsed by Carmelo Anthony in 2012).

During the 2005–06 season Marbury feuded with head coach Larry Brown. Towards the end of the 2005–2006 season, the Knicks&#x27; poor performance combined with Marbury&#x27;s public spats with his coach led to a severe decline in Marbury&#x27;s popularity, with Frank Isola and Michael O&#x27;Keefe of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; stating that Marbury is &quot;the most reviled athlete in New York.&quot;

The public feud between Marbury and Brown was one of the reasons Larry Brown was fired at the end of the 2005–06 season. Isiah Thomas took over the coaching role and the Knicks were slightly more successful during the 2006–2007 season, surpassing the previous year&#x27;s 23 wins, 54 games into their 82-game season, before falling off and finishing with only 33.

In September 2007, Marbury testified at the trial of a sexual harassment lawsuit that had been filed against the Knicks and Isiah Thomas. At the trial, Marbury testified that he and a Knicks intern had &quot;got[ten] together&quot; in his car outside a strip club in 2005.

The start of the 2007–08 season found the Knicks again floundering and Marbury again involved in a public feud, this time with Thomas. The pivotal incident involved Marbury leaving the team after learning that Thomas planned to remove him from the starting lineup. There were reports that Marbury and Thomas actually came to blows on the team plane, and that Marbury threatened to blackmail Thomas for taking him out of the starting lineup—both in the presence of Knick teammates. Following the incident and Marbury&#x27;s return to the team in mid-November after one missed game, Knick fans consistently chanted &quot;fire Isiah&quot; at home games and constantly booed virtually all of the Knicks, especially Marbury. The dysfunction and drama were accompanied by 8 straight Knicks losses, and several newspapers reported that Isiah&#x27;s job was in jeopardy. There were also rumors that the Knicks wanted to trade Marbury to another team. However, this proved difficult for the Knicks to accomplish, in view of the two years and approximately $42 million remaining under his contract with the Knicks. Following a season-ending ankle surgery in February 2008, which was reportedly deemed unnecessary by the team, but which Marbury elected to undergo regardless, Isiah Thomas hinted that Marbury could have played his final game in a Knicks uniform. However, in April 2008, it was Thomas who was removed from his position; first as president, being replaced by Donnie Walsh, and then as coach, being replaced by Mike D&#x27;Antoni.

After D&#x27;Antoni took over, the Knicks signed Chris Duhon, leading to speculations over Marbury&#x27;s future in New York. Marbury arrived to training camp, and competed with Duhon for the starting point guard job, which Duhon won. When D&#x27;Antoni told Marbury that he had an opportunity to play approximately 35 minutes in a game if he wanted to, Marbury, apparently feeling he and the Knicks had gone their own ways, allegedly refused. Following that, on December 1, Marbury was banned from attending any Knicks&#x27; practices or games.

===Boston Celtics (2009)===
On February 24, 2009, the Knicks and Marbury agreed to a buyout after much speculation. He cleared waivers two days later, making him a free agent. Marbury had been speculated to join the Boston Celtics by many NBA analysts since late 2008, and on February 27, 2009, Marbury signed with the Celtics. In his debut, he played against the Indiana Pacers, adding 8 points on 4 of 6 shooting, and 2 assists in 13 minutes. Marbury wore the jersey number 8, as No. 3 had been retired in honor of Dennis Johnson.

Marbury was offered a one-year contract by the Celtics for the 2009–10 season for the veteran&#x27;s minimum. However, he did not agree to the contract. He later announced that he would take a year off from basketball to attend to his business interests.

===Shanxi Zhongyu Brave Dragons (2010)===
In January 2010, it was announced that Marbury had signed with the Shanxi Zhongyu Brave Dragons of the Chinese Basketball Association. In his first game, Marbury, suffering from jet lag, contributed 15 points, 4 rebounds, 8 assists, and 4 steals in 28 minutes of action. He averaged 22.9 points, 9.5 assists and 2.6 steals in 15 games, but Shanxi eventually failed to advance to the playoffs. Marbury later participated in the CBA All-Star match between the North and the South teams, contributing 30 points and 10 assists for the North team. He won the MVP title for the All-Star game. In July 2010, Marbury agreed to a three-year deal to remain with the Brave Dragons. However, he left the team in December 2010

===Foshan Dralions (2010–2011)===
In December 2010 Marbury joined the Foshan Dralions. Like the previous season, Marbury played in the starting five of the 2011 CBA All-Star match, but his team failed to make the playoffs.

===Beijing Ducks (2011–2017)===
During the 2011–2012 season, the Beijing Ducks, led by Stephon Marbury, started out the season with a 13–0 record. Like the previous two seasons, Marbury played in the starting five for the 2012 CBA All-Star match, but unlike the previous two years, his team made the playoffs. Averaging 45 points per game during the Shanxi series, Marbury led Beijing to their first ever CBA Finals match-up against the 7-time champion Guangdong Southern Tigers. Marbury then led his Beijing Ducks Team to the 2011–2012 season CBA championship. Following the team&#x27;s championship, in May 2012, a statue of Marbury was unveiled on the lawn of the MasterCard Center, the 2008 Olympic basketball arena, in Beijing. Dennis Rodman spoke at the ceremony.

In the second game of the 2012–13 CBA season, Marbury tallied 13 assists in a victory over the Jilin Northeast Tigers. This was the highest number of assists Marbury had produced in a single game since his tenure with the Ducks began. He then scored 32 points in an away game against Liaoning. Beijing won that game by 4 points. He was named the CBA Foreign MVP for the season.

On March 30, 2014, Marbury won a second CBA championship with the Beijing Ducks. On March 22, 2015, he won his third CBA championship with his team, as well as his first official CBA Finals MVP award.

On February 25, 2017, Marbury announced he would retire at the end of the 2017-18 CBA season.

On April 24, 2017, the Ducks officially parted ways with Marbury.

===Beijing Fly Dragons (2017–2018)===
On July 19, 2017, Marbury announced that for his last season, he would play for the Beijing Fly Dragons. He later posted that after his season with the Fly Dragons concluded, he&#x27;d look to try and finish his career with an NBA team. However, on February 11, 2018, Marbury played his final game in the CBA, scoring 20 points in a 104–92 win over the Jiangsu Dragons, and announced his retirement from basketball.

==Coaching career==
On June 24, 2019, Marbury was named head coach of the Beijing Royal Fighters of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He helped turn around the team&#x27;s performance.

On March 8, 2020, Marbury warned NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to stop the 2019–2020 season, saying, &quot;the game won&#x27;t be fun if people die.&quot; He specifically asked Silver to &quot;be the one to make the hard, easy decision.&quot; This request was made three days before the first NBA player tested positive for the coronavirus and Silver suspended the season.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Stephon&#x27;s father Don died on December 2, 2007, during a game between the Knicks and the Phoenix Suns.

Stephon&#x27;s brother Zach has played professional basketball in Venezuela. Marbury is a cousin of former professional basketball player Sebastian Telfair. He is also a cousin of former Providence College star and former NBA journeyman Jamel Thomas. In a book, Thomas claimed Marbury&#x27;s selfish actions in Minnesota prevented Thomas from signing a contract with the Timberwolves.

Stephon and his wife Latasha married on September 14, 2002. They divorced in 2023. He has three children: Xaviera, Stephon II, and Stephanie.

===Legal issues and controversies===
Marbury was jailed 10 days for DUI after being stopped and arrested for driving 40 km above the speed limit. At the time of his arrest, he registered more than twice Arizona&#x27;s legal limit of blood alcohol level.

In 2007, Marbury admitted in federal court for having affairs with an intern after a group outing to a strip club in 2005.

===Philanthropy===
In 2001, Marbury donated $250,000 of the money derived from Pepsi sponsorships to help victims of the September 11 attacks.

In 2005, Marbury donated between $500,000 and $1,000,000 to help victims of Hurricane Katrina.

In 2007, Marbury donated $4,000,000 to New York City, $1,000,000 each to the NYPD, FDNY, EMT, and New York City Teacher&#x27;s Fund.

In 2014, Marbury was named one of the Top 10 Model Citizens for Beijing due to his commitment to the Beijing community and the charity work he provided for it. He became the first international citizen to earn such an honor since its inception by the Beijing government.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Marbury worked with a China supplier to sell millions of masks at cost to assist first responders and hospital workers in New York City.

===Fashion===
In 2006, Marbury partnered with Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s to promote a line of shoes and clothing bearing his nickname, &quot;Starbury&quot;.
The line of shoes he endorsed sold for $14.98, far less than many other shoe lines. The reason for doing so, he stated at the time, was to provide kids a way to get fashionable basketball shoes for a reasonable price, and avoid the problem of having expensive shoes that are the target of theft.
Marbury was not paid to endorse the shoes, but was compensated based on sales of the shoes. Since then, but not due to business with Marbury, Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s filed for bankruptcy and closed all stores.
Shortly after Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s closed, Marbury opened Starbury.com to sell his shoes and an expanded product line through a partnership with Amazon.com. Starbury has also announced plans to open dozens of stores and a distributorship in China.
In May 2017, Marbury expressed interest in helping Big Baller Brand partner with a Chinese sports apparel company.

===In popular culture===
Marbury is on the cover of the Midway video game &quot;NBA Ballers&quot;. He has been named to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of &quot;Good Guys in Sports&quot; three times.

In the Spike Lee movie &quot;He Got Game&quot;, fictional Brooklyn high school star Jesus Shuttlesworth (played by Ray Allen) mentions Stephon Marbury as one of the great New York City legends to make it out of Coney Island to the NBA. The high school in the movie, Abraham Lincoln, is where Marbury attended high school.

In 1999, Marbury, alongside fellow former Georgia Tech point guard Kenny Anderson, appeared in the video for Big Pun&#x27;s single &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot; which was produced by Juju of The Beatnuts. In the video, Marbury and Anderson play a 2 on 2 game versus Terror Squad members Fat Joe and Cuban Link.

In 2007, Marbury co-authored his first children&#x27;s book with Marshall Dean entitled &quot;The Adventures of Young Starbury: Practice Makes Perfect&quot;. The book was illustrated by Ryan Nakai.

In March 2008, wrestler Montel Vontavious Porter said in an interview that he based his wrestling persona on Marbury. M.V.P. said he had an encounter with Marbury when he was a doorman at a club.

In July 2009, Marbury engaged in a 24-hour live-streaming broadcast in which he answered questions from fans, openly wept, and ate vaseline to soothe a sore throat. He would later admit that he was depressed and suicidal at the time.

Marbury appeared in the 2014 musical &quot;I Am Marbury&quot;, which is allegorically based on his life.

In 2017, Marbury starred in his own autobiographical movie titled &quot;My Other Home&quot;, alongside Jessica Jung.

A documentary about Marbury, &quot;A Kid from Coney Island&quot;, was released in 2019.

===China permanent residence permit===
In 2015, Marbury applied for and received a Chinese &quot;green card&quot;, or Permanent Resident ID Card (). He is the fifth American basketball player to receive a green card in China. He also earned the nickname Commissar Ma () for his role as a mentor to the teammates and younger players while playing in China.

===Sports team owner===
On October 20, 2017, it was announced that Marbury had reached an agreement to become the owner of the Beijing Lions of the China Arena Football League.

<text>Hotep Idris Galeta (7 June 1941 – 3 November 2010) was a South African jazz pianist and educator. His legal name at birth was Cecil Galeta, but according to local custom he was more commonly known as a child and young man as Cecil Barnard, his father&#x27;s first name being used instead of a last name.

==Biography==
===Early years===
In his teens he played with some of the best jazz musicians in South Africa; Abdullah Ibrahim (then known as Dollar Brand) and Lami Zokufa introduced him to bebop and hard bop. In 1961 he left South Africa clandestinely, following many other South African performers to the United Kingdom (severe restrictions on public gatherings following the Sharpeville massacre had made entertainment careers impossible for any but white artists, and the already poor quality of life for non-whites was deteriorating rapidly as apartheid became ever stricter). After a year in the United Kingdom, he moved to the United States.

===In the US===
In the United States, he played and recorded with Herb Alpert, John Handy, Bobby Hutcherson, Elvin Jones, Hugh Masekela, Jackie McLean, Mario Pavone, Joshua Redman, and Archie Shepp. Outside jazz he performed and recorded with David Crosby and the Byrds. In 1985, Jackie McLean invited him to teach at The Hartt School of the University of Hartford, where he taught until his return to South Africa in 1991, following the collapse of apartheid.

===Return to South Africa===
After his return, he recorded, performed, and taught in South Africa. His teaching engagements included four years on the faculty of the University of Fort Hare, the musical directorship of a national music education program for high schools, and co-ordination of music outreach programs in Cape Town. He was also Project Manager for the establishment of a school of jazz and a multimedia audio visual production center at the University of Fort Hare&#x27;s new urban campus in the east coast South African city of East London in the Eastern Cape Province.

===Death===
Galeta died in Johannesburg on the 3 November 2010, following an asthma attack.

<text>(NJPW) is a Japanese professional wrestling promotion founded on January 13, 1972, by Antonio Inoki, and based in Nakano, Tokyo. It is currently owned by card game company Bushiroad, while TV Asahi and Amuse Inc. own minority shares of the company. Naoki Sugabayashi has served as the promotion&#x27;s Chairman since September 2013, while Hiroshi Tanahashi has served as the president of the promotion since December 2023. 

Owing to its TV program aired on TV Asahi, NJPW is the largest and longest-running professional wrestling promotion in Japan. Their biggest event is the January 4 Tokyo Dome Show (currently promoted under the Wrestle Kingdom banner) held each year since 1992. In addition to promoting professional wrestling matches, NJPW has also showcased mixed martial arts fights on some of its live events.

The promotion was owned by Yuke&#x27;s from 2005 until 2012. It was then sold to Bushiroad in 2012, which parlayed its entry to the world of professional wrestling into a best-selling trading card game, &quot;King of Pro Wrestling&quot;, and appearances from NJPW stars in its various franchises.

NJPW was affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance at various points in its history. NJPW also has and has had agreements with various MMA and professional wrestling promotions around the world; including WWE, World Championship Wrestling, American Wrestling Association, World Class Championship Wrestling, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, WAR, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, UWFi, Ring of Honor, Pride Fighting Championships, and All Elite Wrestling.

==History==
===Formation and early history (1972–2000)===

The promotion was founded by Antonio Inoki on January 13, 1972 after his departure from the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance promotion. The first NJPW event, titled &quot;Opening Series&quot;, took place on March 6, 1972, in the Ota Ward Gymnasium in Tokyo, to a crowd of 5,000. The following year, NJPW signed a television deal with NET TV, now known as TV Asahi. The company launched its own governing body, the International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP); and in 1983, Hulk Hogan became the first ever IWGP Heavyweight Champion by defeating Inoki. However, this championship was later abandoned and the current version of the championship was established in 1987. Inoki would serve as the president of the promotion until 1989, when he was succeeded by Seiji Sakaguchi.

On April 24, 1989, NJPW hosted Battle Satellite, its first show in the Tokyo Dome. The promotion was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from 1975 to 1985 and once more from 1992 to 1993. NJPW was briefly reaffiliated with the NWA in the late 2000s to the early 2010s as well. On January 4, 1992, NJPW partnered with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) to produce Super Warriors, the first ever January 4 Tokyo Dome Show, an event that would become an annual tradition for NJPW and is considered their biggest event of the year and comparable to WWE&#x27;s WrestleMania event. In April 1995, NJPW and WCW held the two-day Collision in Korea event at the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea. The event was the first professional wrestling event held in North Korea and holds the record for most attended wrestling event of all time, with 355,000 people packing the stadium over the two days.

===Decline and Inoki&#x27;s departure (2000–2011)===
In the early 2000s, the burgeoning popularity of mixed martial arts (MMA) in Japan was noticed by Inoki, who wanted to integrate elements of shoot wrestling to make the company appear more realistic. The company would partner with martial arts organization K-1 and begin to insert wrestlers into MMA fights, with the goal of pushing NJPW in a more realistic direction and to make it appear as an actual sport. The company&#x27;s new management was criticized by critics and fans. Inoki later departed NJPW in 2005 after selling his share of the company to Yuke&#x27;s, and began his own promotion, the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), in 2007. After his departure, Inoki&#x27;s son-in-law Simon took over the company, before Naoki Sugabayashi was appointed president in 2007 after Simon also left NJPW to join Antonio in IGF. After the departure of the Inoki family, the company began to reintegrate its prior puroresu style of wrestling.

Also in 2007, NJPW hosted its first ever pay-per-view (PPV) event Wrestle Kingdom I.

The promotion debuted a new series called NEVER in August 2010, designed to be a series of events spotlighting younger up-and-coming New Japan talent and feature more outsider participation in the promotion. On January 4, 2011, New Japan officially announced the NJPW Invasion Tour 2011: Attack on East Coast, the promotion&#x27;s first tour of the United States to be held in May 2011. The tour featured shows in Rahway, New Jersey on May 13, New York City on May 14 and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 15, as well as cross-promotion with American independent group Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW). As part of the tour, NJPW introduced a new title, the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.

===Acquisition by Bushiroad and expansion (2012–2020)===
On January 31, 2012, Yuke&#x27;s announced that it had sold all shares of New Japan Pro-Wrestling to card game company Bushiroad for ¥500 million ($6.5 million).

New Japan aired its first internet pay-per-view, the fourth day of the 2012 G1 Climax, on August 5, 2012. The October 8, 2012, King of Pro-Wrestling pay-per-view marked the first time viewers outside Japan were able to order a pay-per-view by the promotion through Ustream. On October 5, 2012, New Japan announced the creation of the NEVER Openweight Championship, which would be contested for on the NEVER series. A two-day tournament to determine the inaugural champion was held between November 15 and 19, 2012. The final NEVER event was held in November 2012.

In February 2014, New Japan announced a partnership with Ring of Honor (ROH), which saw the promotion return to North America the following May to present two supershows; Global Wars in Toronto and War of the Worlds in New York City.

A year later, NJPW and ROH announced another tour together to produce four more supershows; War of the Worlds &#x27;15 on May 12 and 13 in Philadelphia and Global Wars &#x27;15 on May 15 and 16 in Toronto.

Also in November 2014, the American AXS TV network announced it had acquired rights to rebroadcast a series of thirteen episodes of NJPW matches from TV Asahi. The series premiered on January 16, 2015, airing weekly on Fridays. Averaging 200,000 viewers per episode, the show was considered a success, leading to AXS TV and TV Asahi signing a multi-year deal to continue airing the show. In June 2016, the show was also acquired by the Canadian Fight Network. On December 1, 2014, NJPW and TV Asahi announced NJPW World, a new worldwide streaming site for the promotion&#x27;s events.

NJPW will utilize the partnership as an opportunity to scout talent from Oceania.

Four days later, NJPW held a press conference to announce plans to establish a subsidiary company, including a dojo, in the United States. A Los Angeles office was scheduled to be opened before the end of 2017, with a dojo scheduled to be opened at the start of 2018. NJPW&#x27;s second American event, Strong Style Evolved, took place on March 25, 2018, also in Long Beach.

Following the departures of A.J. Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura, NJPW chairman Takaaki Kidani announced in February 2016 that the promotion was returning to the multi-year contract system. The contracts forbid negotiations with other promotions. After All Elite Wrestling (AEW) was launched by wrestlers working for NJPW, they started signing foreigners to guaranteed deals as well.

<doc id="635625" wikidata="Q7177139" url="?curid=635625" title="Peter Stothard">
<text>Sir Peter Stothard (born 28 February 1951) is a British author, journalist and critic. From 1992 to 2002 he was editor of &quot;The Times&quot; and from 2002 to 2016 editor of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, the only journalist to have held both roles. He writes books about Roman history and his four books of memoir cover both political and classical themes.

== Early life ==
He was the son of Max Stothard, an electrical engineer who worked at the Marconi Research Centre, Great Baddow. He grew up on the nearby Rothmans Estate. He was educated at Brentwood School, Essex (1962–68); and Trinity College, Oxford, where he became editor of Oxford University student newspaper &quot;Cherwell.&quot;

== Career ==
Stothard joined the BBC after leaving university, and wrote for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;New Society&quot; and &quot;Plays and Players&quot;. He joined &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1978 and &quot;The Times&quot; in 1981, becoming chief leader writer, deputy editor and, based in Washington, US editor. He published &quot;Thirty Days: An Inside Account of Tony Blair at War&quot; in 2004, based on observations inside Downing Street during the Iraq War.

During a stage of Stothard&#x27;s editorship, &quot;The Times&quot; reached an average sale of over 900,000 – the highest in its history. This was, in part, the result of the so-called &quot;price war&quot; that started in 1993 when &quot;The Times&quot; reduced its cover price and started intense circulation battles against &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;.

In 1999, he became involved in a controversial legal dispute over political funding with the Conservative Party treasurer Michael Ashcroft. Lord Ashcroft sued, but subsequently withdrew his suit after a statement agreed by both parties.

Stothard was named as Editor of the Year in the same year by Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;What the Papers Say&quot;.

In 2000, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and was away from &quot;The Times&quot; for 10 months for successful treatment. It returned in 2012 and 2013.

Whilst editor of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement,&quot; he often wrote about Greek and Roman literature.

In 2010, his first book of memoir, &quot;On the Spartacus Road&quot;, combined an account of the Spartacus uprising with elements of autobiography. His second, &quot;Alexandria, The Last Nights of Cleopatra&quot;, extended the same form, including accounts of newspaper life alongside the story of his engagement with Greece, Rome and Egypt. &quot;Alexandria...&quot; won the 2013 Criticos Prize for literature on themes from ancient or modern Greece. &quot;The Senecans: Four Men and Margaret Thatcher&quot;, his memoir of the 1980s and &#x27;90s, was published in September 2016. The critic Stuart Kelly described Stothard as &quot;one of the most avant-garde practitioners of the form&quot;.

He was chairman of judges for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction (2012) and president of the Classical Association. In 2017, he was appointed a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, London. Stothard appears as a character briefly in the first scene of a one-level &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; expansion videogame made by Core Design in association with &quot;The Times&quot;. The expansion is called Times Exclusive Level and was released in 2000.

==Personal life==
Stothard is married to the biographer and critic Ruth Scurr. He has a son, Michael (born 1987), and a daughter, the novelist Anna Stothard (born 1983) from his marriage to novelist Sally Emerson (1980-2021), and six grandchildren from that marriage. 

==Honours==
He was knighted for services to the newspaper industry in 2003.

In 2013, he was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal by the British Academy and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2023.

<doc id="635627" wikidata="Q550632" url="?curid=635627" title="Roger Sessions">
<text>Roger Huntington Sessions (December 28, 1896March 16, 1985) was an American composer, teacher, and writer on music. He had initially started his career writing in a neoclassical style, but gradually moved further towards more complex harmonies and postromanticism, and finally the twelve-tone serialism of the Second Viennese School. Sessions&#x27; friendship with Arnold Schoenberg influenced this, but he would modify the technique to develop a unique style involving rows to supply melodic thematic material, while composing the subsidiary parts in a free and dissonant manner.

==Life==
Sessions was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a family that could trace its roots back to the American Revolution. His mother, Ruth Huntington Sessions, was a direct descendant of Samuel Huntington, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Roger studied music at Harvard University from the age of 14. There he wrote for and subsequently edited the &quot;Harvard Musical Review&quot;. Graduating at age 18, he went on to study at Yale University under Horatio Parker and Ernest Bloch before teaching at Smith College. With the exception, mostly, of his incidental music to the play &quot;The Black Maskers&quot;, composed in part in Cleveland in 1923, his first major compositions came while he was traveling Europe with his first wife in his mid-twenties and early thirties.

Returning to the United States in 1933, he taught first at Princeton University (from 1936), moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught from 1945 to 1953, and then returned to Princeton until retiring in 1965. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961. He was appointed Bloch Professor at Berkeley (1966–67), and gave the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University in 1968–69. He continued to teach on a part-time basis at the Juilliard School from 1966 until 1983.

He was a friend of both Arnold Schoenberg and Thomas Mann.

In 1968 Sessions was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contribution to the arts by the MacDowell Colony. Sessions won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1974 citing &quot;his life&#x27;s work as a distinguished American composer.&quot; In 1982 he won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Music for his Concerto for Orchestra, first performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on October 23, 1981.

Sessions married Barbara Foster in June 1920. They divorced in September 1936. He married Sarah Elizabeth Franck in November 1936. They had two children, John Porter Sessions (1938–2014) and Elizabeth Phelps Sessions (born 1940). John Sessions became a professional cellist. Roger Sessions died at the age of 88 in Princeton, New Jersey.

==Style==
His works written up to 1930 or so are more or less neoclassical in style. Those written between 1930 and 1945 are more or less tonal but harmonically complex. The works from 1946 onwards are atonal and, beginning with the Solo Violin Sonata of 1953, serial although not consistently employing Viennese twelve-tone technique. Only the first movement and the trio of the scherzo of the Violin Sonata, for example, employ a twelve-tone row strictly, the rest employing a scalar-constructed dissonant style. Sessions&#x27;s usual method was to use a row to control the full chromaticism and motivic-intervallic cohesion that already marks his music from before 1953. He treated his rows with great freedom, however, typically using pairs of unordered complementary hexachords to provide “harmonic” aspects without determining note-by-note melodic succession, or conversely using the row to supply melodic thematic material while freely composing the subsidiary parts.

<doc id="635632" wikidata="Q1374481" url="?curid=635632" title="Garry Shandling">
<text>Garry Emmanuel Shandling (November 29, 1949 – March 24, 2016) was an American actor, comedian, writer, director, and producer.

Shandling began his career writing for sitcoms, such as &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;. He made a successful stand-up performance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; where he became a frequent guest host. Shandling was, for a time, considered the leading contender to replace Johnny Carson. In 1986, he created &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;, which aired on Showtime. It was nominated for four Emmy Awards (including one for Shandling) and lasted until 1990.

Shandling&#x27;s second show, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, began airing on HBO in 1992. He was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards for the show and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series in 1998, along with Peter Tolan, for writing the series finale. In film, he had a recurring role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; and &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;. He also lent his voice to Verne the turtle in &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;. Shandling&#x27;s final performance was as the voice of Ikki in the live-action remake of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

During his four-decade career, Shandling was nominated for 19 Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards, along with many other awards and nominations. He served as host of the Grammy Awards four times and as host of the Emmy Awards two times.

==Early life==
Garry Emmanuel Shandling was born into a Jewish family in Chicago on November 29, 1949, the son of pet store proprietor Muriel Estelle (née Singer) and print shop owner Irving Shandling. He grew up in the Casa Loma Estates area of Tucson, Arizona, having moved there with his family so that his older brother Barry could receive treatment for cystic fibrosis. Barry died of the disease when Shandling was 10. After graduating from Palo Verde High School, Shandling attended the University of Arizona to major in electrical engineering, but instead completed a degree in marketing and pursued a year of postgraduate studies in creative writing.

==Career==
===Early work===
When Shandling was 19, he drove two hours to a club in Phoenix and showed some jokes to George Carlin, who was performing there. The next day, on a repeat round-trip, Carlin told him that he had &quot;funny stuff on every page&quot; and should keep at it. In 1973, he moved to Los Angeles and worked at an advertising agency for a time, then sold a script for the popular NBC sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. He also wrote scripts for the sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; and attended a story meeting for &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;.

===Stand-up comedy===
Shandling said that he became a stand-up comedian because of an incident that happened one day at a story meeting for &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, in which one of the show&#x27;s producers complained about a line of dialogue and said, &quot;Well, Chrissy wouldn&#x27;t say that.&quot; He recalled, &quot;I just looked. I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think I can do this.&#x27; And I stopped right there and went on to perform.&quot;

In 1978, Shandling performed his first stand-up routine at The Comedy Store. A year later, he was one of the few performers to cross the picket line when a group of comedians organized a boycott against the Comedy Store, protesting owner Mitzi Shore&#x27;s policy of not paying comedians to perform. According to William Knoedelseder, Shandling &quot;was the scion of a family with decidedly antiunion views. He had not shared the struggling comic experience. He was a successful sitcom writer trying to break into stand-up, and prior to the strike, Shore had refused to put him in the regular lineup because she didn&#x27;t think he was good enough. Of course, that changed the minute he crossed the picket line.&quot;

Shandling&#x27;s onstage persona was an anxiety-ridden, nervous, uptight, conservative man on the verge of a breakdown. After a couple of years on the road, he was booked by a talent scout from &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; to appear as a guest in 1981. Shandling substituted for Carson on a regular basis until 1987, when he left to focus on his cable show, leaving Jay Leno as permanent guest host and Carson&#x27;s eventual successor.

In 1984, Shandling performed his first stand-up special, &quot;Garry Shandling: Alone in Vegas&quot; for Showtime, followed by a second televised special in 1986, &quot;The Garry Shandling Show: 25th Anniversary Special&quot;, also for Showtime. In 1991, a third special, &quot;Garry Shandling: Stand-Up,&quot; was part of the &quot;HBO Comedy Hour&quot;.

===Television series===
====&quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;====
In 1985, Shandling and Alan Zweibel went on to create &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;. Through 1990, it ran for 72 episodes on Showtime. The edited reruns played on the Fox network beginning in 1988. Shandling wrote 15 of the episodes.

The series subverted the standard sitcom format by having its characters openly acknowledge that they were all part of a television series. Building on a concept that hearkened back to &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, in which George Burns would frequently break the &quot;fourth wall&quot; and speak directly to the audience, Shandling&#x27;s series went so far as to incorporate the audience and elements of the studio itself into the storylines, calling attention to the show&#x27;s artifice.

The series was nominated for four Emmy Awards, including one for Shandling. He won an American Comedy Award for Funniest Male Performance in a Series; and four CableACE awards, two for Best Comedy Series. The show also won an award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy from the Television Critics Association.

====&quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;====

In 1992, Shandling launched another critical and commercial success by creating the mock behind-the-scenes talk show sitcom &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, which ran for 89 episodes through to 1998 on HBO. It garnered 56 Emmy Award nominations and three wins. Shandling based the series on his experiences guest-hosting &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

In 1993, NBC offered Shandling $5 million to take over &quot;Late Night&quot; when David Letterman announced his highly publicized move to CBS, but Shandling declined. He was subsequently offered &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, but also declined in favor of continuing &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;.

Shandling wrote 38 episodes of the series and directed three in its final season. He was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards for the series: five for acting, seven for writing, and six for being co-executive producer with Brad Grey. He won one Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for the series finale &quot;Flip&quot;. He was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor (Musical or Comedy) in 1994 and 1995. He won two American Comedy Awards for Funniest Male Performance in a Comedy Series, eight CableACE Awards, and a BAFTA Award. The series influenced other shows, such as &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, where guest stars portray themselves.

In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; as 38th Greatest Show of All Time. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it the 28th Best Show of the past 25 years, and it was included on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Shows of All Time.

The first season was re-released in 2007, along with a &quot;Not Just the Best of the Larry Sanders Show&quot;, Shandling&#x27;s picks of the best 23 episodes.

In October 2012, Shandling returned with fellow cast members from &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Reunions issue, where he was reunited with co-stars Rip Torn, Jeffrey Tambor, Sarah Silverman, Penny Johnson Jerald, Wallace Langham and Mary Lynn Rajskub.

===Other work===

Shandling hosted the Grammy Awards in 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1994. He hosted the Emmy Awards in 2000 and 2004, and co-hosted (doing the opening monologue) in 2003. He appeared occasionally in films, beginning with a cameo as Mr. Vertisey in &quot;The Night We Never Met&quot;. He had supporting roles in &quot;Love Affair&quot; and &quot;Mixed Nuts;&quot; &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (1998), as the voice of a live-action pigeon; the David Rabe play adaptation &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; (1998); and &quot;Trust the Man&quot; (2001). He wrote and starred in Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;What Planet Are You From?&quot; (2000) and co-starred with Warren Beatty and others in &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; (2001).

In October 1999, Shandling, with David Rensin, published &quot;Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host: The Autobiography of Larry Sanders&quot;, written in the voice of his alter-ego Larry Sanders.

He also appeared in a brief cameo in &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001). Again voicing an animal, Shandling co-starred as Verne in &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; (2006), which became one of his best-known roles. He appeared in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010) as Senator Stern, and reprised the role in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014). He appeared in an uncredited cameo as a health inspector in &quot;The Dictator&quot; (2012).

He starred as himself representing Fox Mulder, alongside Téa Leoni as Dana Scully in &quot;The X-Files&quot; season 7 spoof episode &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot;

In February 2010, Shandling was staying at the same Waipio Valley hotel that Conan O&#x27;Brien checked into after his departure from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. They spent their entire vacations together, Shandling helping to rehabilitate O&#x27;Brien.

Shandling was a longtime friend of Jerry Seinfeld. In 2016, two months before his death, he appeared on Seinfeld&#x27;s show &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1977, Shandling was involved in a car crash in Beverly Hills that left him in critical condition for two days and hospitalized for two weeks with a crushed spleen. While in the hospital, he had a near-death experience and later said, &quot;I had a vivid near-death experience that involved a voice asking, &#x27;Do you want to continue leading Garry Shandling&#x27;s life?&#x27; Without thinking, I said, &#x27;Yes.&#x27; Since then, I&#x27;ve been stuck living in the physical world while knowing, without a doubt, that there&#x27;s something much more meaningful within it all. That realization is what drives my life and work.&quot; The accident inspired him to pursue a career in comedy, and he later turned the accident into part of his routine.

Shandling never married and had no children. He shared an apartment with his fiancée, actress Linda Doucett, from 1987 until they split in 1994. He subsequently had her dismissed from &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, and she filed a lawsuit against his production company Brillstein Entertainment Partners for sexual discrimination and wrongful termination. The case was settled out of court in 1997 for $1 million.

Although Doucett did sue him and the show&#x27;s producer, when Shandling died Doucett shared some details of their time together, including that the only reason they split in 1994 was that he didn&#x27;t want to enlarge his family. She was in her late 30s and early 40s during their relationship, she wanted children, and Shandling was afraid his kids might be born with cystic fibrosis, the genetic problem that killed his brother Barry.

Shandling and Sharon Stone were students of acting coach Roy London and dated briefly, and she appeared on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; in the episode &quot;The Mr. Sharon Stone Show&quot;. They remained close friends until Shandling&#x27;s death in 2016. In the documentary &quot;Special Thanks to Roy London&quot;, interviews with Stone and Shandling discuss their relationship. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article reads:

Shandling preferred to reveal little about his personal life during interviews. He was a Buddhist who enjoyed meditating, playing basketball, and boxing four times per week. He co-owned a boxing gym in Santa Monica, TSB 44 (Tough Strong Bold No. 44), with actor and director Peter Berg. He was also a licensed amateur radio operator. Starting as a teenager, he held the callsigns WA7BKG, KD6OY, and KQ6KA. The latter he held with a pseudonym, Dave Waddell, to avoid undue attention when he operated.

==Death==
Garry Shandling died from a blood clot in his lungs after developing blood clots in his legs. He felt unwell during a trip to Hawaii for major dental surgery and &quot;had complained of leg pain and shortness of breath at the time.&quot;

Shandling suffered from hyperparathyroidism, a serious disease which often goes undiagnosed or untreated. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, kidney stones, kidney failure, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias.

On March 24, 2016, at the age of 66, he died at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. The LAPD reported that he had suddenly collapsed in his home and was rushed to the hospital, suffering from an apparent medical emergency. When paramedics arrived, he was unconscious. The autopsy showed that he died from a pulmonary embolism.

Shandling left behind a liquid estate worth around $668,000, which was given to his lawyer and best friend Bill Isaacson, as Shandling had no family or relatives. The bulk of his wealth, however, was held in a private trust he had created. On February 4, 2019, his estate bestowed $15.2 million to benefit medical research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. His gift will establish and endow the Garry Shandling Endocrine Surgery Research Fund, the Garry Shandling Infectious Diseases Innovation Fund, and the Garry Shandling Pancreatic Diseases Fund. The remainder of the bequest will establish the Garry Shandling Medical Research Fund, which will operate under the direction of the medical school&#x27;s dean. In his memory, UCLA also has named the Garry Shandling Learning Studio, a multipurpose space in Geffen Hall, the school&#x27;s medical education building.

==Awards and nominations==
During his four-decade career, Shandling was nominated for 19 Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

Additionally, Shandling won 2 British Comedy Awards, 12 CableACE Awards (including 8 for &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; and 4 for &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;), a BAFTA Award and was nominated for 2 Writers Guild of America Awards for &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. He received three American Comedy Awards, two Satellite Award nominations, and in 2004, he was presented with the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Outstanding Television Writer Award.

<text>Tayseer Allouni (; also: Taysir, Tayseer, Alluni, Aluni, Alony) is a journalist from the Al Jazeera news channel. He was born in Deir ez-Zor in Syria in 1955 then in 1983 he moved to Spain, where he studied Economics, and has lived there ever since, adopting Spanish citizenship in 1988. He interviewed Osama bin Laden following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and was controversially convicted on terrorism-related charges in Spain in 2005.

==Life==

Alluni was born in Deir ez-Zor, Syria in 1955 and went on to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from a Syrian university. He traveled to Spain in 1985 to continue his studies but due to economic hardships he worked as a trader instead. He married in 1987 and is a father of five children.

After becoming a Spanish citizen in 1988 he held a number of jobs in Spain, including teaching Arabic and working in the municipality taxation office of the city of Ceuta. In 1996, he joined the Arabic service of the Spanish news agency EFE as a translator. During his work there, he started freelancing for Al Jazeera. During this same year he also began working with the Institute of Peace and Dispute Studies in Granada. In 1999, he joined Al Jazeera as their correspondent in Afghanistan and headed the Kabul office for a period of two years before 11 September 2001. During the US war against the Taliban and al-Qaida, he was the only foreign journalist to remain in Kabul and broadcast to the world images of the unfolding events.

After the US bombing of the Al Jazeera office in Kabul, he returned to Doha, Qatar, to continue his work for Al Jazeera as a newsroom journalist. During the Iraq War in 2003, he went to Baghdad and covered the US-led invasion.

==Work==
Highlights of his career include
* working as a correspondent for Al Jazeera in Afghanistan; he was the only international correspondent in Kabul in October 2001 and had previously covered the destruction of the Buddha statues of Bamiyan by the Taliban in March 2001
* interviewing Osama bin Laden on October 21, 2001 
* being deported from Iraq prior to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein
* being arrested in Spain while investigating the Madrid train bombings
* sentenced by Audiencia Nacional of Spain on 26 September 2005 to seven years imprisonment for being a financial courier for Al-Qaida. Allouni defends himself by saying that he merely interviewed Bin Laden after the September 11th attacks on the United States.
* set free on 6 October 2006 under home detention due to his medical condition.
* interviewing Abu Muhammad al-Golani, the head of al-Nusra Front in Syria on December 19, 2013

==Prosecution after the 2004 Madrid train bombings==
On Monday September 26, 2005, a Spanish court found Alluni guilty of collaboration with al-Qaida, sentencing the Syrian-born, naturalized Spaniard to seven years in jail. Allouni, who insisted on his innocence throughout Europe&#x27;s biggest al-Qaida trial, interviewed the group&#x27;s leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan weeks after the September 11 attacks in the United States. Accused of acting as a financial courier to the group while in Afghanistan, Alluni, who had faced a maximum nine-year term, said in testimony he was only doing his job as a journalist. A campaign regarding his innocence has been mounted by amongst others Al Jazeera and the Arab Commission for Human Rights. On January 17, 2012, a European court decided that the seven-year term Allouni was given over charges of collusion with a terror organization was not legal. He was freed in March 2012, and returned to Doha.

He has now continued working in Doha and reunited with his family which he continues to raise, despite the long prison sentence he received.

<text>The Six Steeds of Zhao Mausoleum () are six Tang (618–907) Chinese stone reliefs of horses (1.7m x 2.0m each) which were located in the Zhao Mausoleum, Shaanxi, China. Zhao Mausoleum is the mausoleum of Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649).

By tradition the reliefs were designed by the court painter, and administrator for public works, Yan Liben, and the relief is so flat and linear that it seems likely they were carved after drawings or paintings. Yan Liben is documented as producing other works for the tomb, a portrait series that is now lost, and perhaps designed the whole structure.

The steeds were six precious war horses of Taizong, which he rode during the early campaigns to reunify China under the Tang, and all bear names which are not Chinese but rather transliterations of Turkic or Central Asian terms, indicative of the horses&#x27; probable origin as gifts or tributes from the Tujue to the Tang forces. They are:
* Quanmaogua (), Taizong&#x27;s steed during the campaign against Liu Heita.
* Shifachi (), ridden during the Battle of Hulao against Dou Jiande. Its name derives from the Turkic term Shad.
* Baitiwu (), ridden during the campaign against Xue Rengao.
* Telebiao (), ridden during the campaign against Song Jingang. Its name is originally 特勤 &quot;Teqin&quot;, derived from the Turkic term Tegin.
* Qingzhui (), ridden during the campaign against Dou Jiande.
* Saluzi (), ridden during the campaign against Wang Shichong. Its name derives from the Turkic &#x27;Isbara&#x27;, itself a derivation from the Sanskrit &#x27;Isvara&#x27; meaning prince.

The sculptures are regarded as ancient Chinese art treasures. Two (Quanmaogua and Saluzi) were sold by C.T. Loo in 1914 and are exhibited at the Penn Museum at University of Pennsylvania, USA. The remaining four are exhibited in the Stele Forest museum of Xi&#x27;an.

<text>Michael de Larrabeiti (18 August 1934 – 18 April 2008) was an English novelist and travel writer. He is best known for writing &quot;The Borrible Trilogy&quot;, which has been cited as an influence by writers in the New Weird movement.

==Early life==
One of five children, de Larrabeiti was born in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and was mostly brought up in Battersea, South London. His mother was of working-class Irish descent and lived most of her life in the Lavender Hill area of London; his father was a Basque from Bilbao and was often absent.

In 1939 he was evacuated to Arundel in West Sussex, before returning to London in 1940, only to be evacuated again to Askern, a mining village near Doncaster in Yorkshire, in the winter. At the end of the Second World War he returned to London and, after failing the 11-plus, was educated at Clapham Central Secondary School. The teachers he had here, often men who had returned from fighting in the war determined to make a better world, were a great influence on de Larrabeiti, something he would later fictionalise in &quot;Journal of a Sad Hermaphrodite&quot;.

==Youth==
After leaving school at sixteen, de Larrabeiti initially worked as a librarian at a public library on Magdalen Road in Earlsfield, south London. In 1952 he began attending Battersea Polytechnic with a view towards taking A-Levels and attending university. This ambition took nine years to fulfill, mainly because of economic reasons. During this period de Larrabeiti, guided by his elder brothers, worked at many things, initially as a cinema projectionist in a 3D cinema in Festival Gardens, Battersea Park during the Festival of Britain. His experiences in the Gardens are recorded in &quot;A Rose Beyond the Thames&quot;. He later worked as a cameraman in documentary films and as a travel guide in France and Morocco.

In 1959 he fell in with a group of Provençal shepherds and went with them on the transhumance, herding three thousand sheep from their winter pasture to summer pasture in the French Alps. He then taught English in Casablanca, and in 1961 was the photographer on the University of Oxford&#x27;s Marco Polo Expedition, travelling four months overland on a pair of BSA motorcycles and sidecar with Stanley Johnson and Tim Severin to Afghanistan and India. The adventure led to the publication of Severin&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;Tracking Marco Polo&quot; with photographs by de Larrabeiti.

Between 1961 and 1965 he read French and English at Trinity College Dublin, from where he won a scholarship to the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he studied in 1965–66; he later began a DPhil at Keble College, Oxford which he later abandoned to take up full-time writing.

==Writing career==
De Larrabeiti continued to work as a guide and tour manager in the travel business for Clarksons and, later, as a freelance contributor to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; travel section, for which he wrote acclaimed travel essays. His books have also been critically well-received, with recent work being long-listed for the Booker Prize. 2006 saw the publication of his most recent novel, &quot;Princess Diana&#x27;s Revenge&quot;; a collection of memoirs entitled &quot;Spots of Time&quot; was published in early 2007. His 1992 novel &quot;Journal of a Sad Hermaphrodite&quot; is also set to be republished, after having been out of print for over ten years.

In his early years he espoused Marxism and remained a left-winger throughout his life. He lived in the Oxfordshire village of Great Milton with his wife Celia, and had three daughters. The last years of his life were blighted by cancer.

<text>Broadfield is one of 14 neighbourhoods within the town of Crawley in West Sussex, England. Broadfield is located in the south west of the town. It is bordered by Bewbush to the north, Southgate to the north east and Tilgate to the east.

Broadfield is split across three local government wards, Broadfield, Bewbush &amp; North Broadfield and Gossops Green &amp; North East Broadfield.

Broadfield was built in several stages and is relatively densely populated. There is a mixture of property types, including private estates, housing association, council houses and self-build.

Broadfield has one central shopping parade, the Barton, which is one of the largest neighbourhood parade in the town. Unlike many of the parades in the town, which are council run, the Barton is owned and managed by the shop-owners. There is a wide variety of shops, a library, a church (shared by Anglicans, Catholics and Broadfield Christian Fellowship), a nearby mosque and a large medical centre. There is also a community centre which is run as a charitable organisation overseen by trustees from the churches.

There are two infant/primary schools in the neighbourhood, an adventure playground, several open spaces with football pitches, and Broadfield Stadium, home to Crawley Town Football Club and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion W.F.C.. In 2005 a purpose-built Sure Start Children&#x27;s Centre was opened on Creasys Drive providing support and facilities for families of under 5&#x27;s. The Broadfield centre works closely with a similar establishment in Bewbush.

Next to the stadium is Broadfield Park which used to be part of the Tilgate Estate. Broadfield House was the hunting lodge for the estate, and the park contains a small lake and some woods.

To the south of Broadfield are the Buchan Country Park and part of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty at Pease Pottage. The latter is currently home to a Scout camp.

Broadfield is served by various bus services including the 24-hour Fastway bus service to Gatwick Airport.

<text>Víctor Jesús Martínez (born December 23, 1978), also known by his nickname &quot;V-Mart&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball designated hitter and catcher. Martínez played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, and Detroit Tigers. After joining the Tigers, he played mostly as a designated hitter.

Martínez was a five-time MLB All-Star. He won the Silver Slugger Award twice, and the Edgar Martínez Award once. He finished runner-up for the American League Most Valuable Player award in 2014. When he retired in 2018, he was seventh among all active players in RBI (1,178).

==Career==

===Cleveland Indians (2002–2009)===
Martínez was signed by the Indians as an amateur free agent in 1996. He was named the Indians 2001 and 2002 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the &quot;Lou Boudreau Award&quot;). After a pair of minor league MVP awards and batting titles in 2001 and 2002, Cleveland added Martínez to their active roster as a September call-up on September 9, 2002. He made his debut with Cleveland on September 10, going 1-for-4 with 2 RBI in a 5–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. Martínez&#x27;s first major league hit was a two-run single in the seventh inning off Blue Jays pitcher Justin Miller. On September 29, Martínez and Earl Snyder hit back-to-back home runs in a 7–3 win over the Kansas City Royals. Both home runs were the first of their careers. In 12 games with Cleveland, Martínez hit .281 with a home run and 5 RBI.

In 2003, Martínez played for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons and the Indians. He finished with a combined .315 batting average, hitting at a .349 clip in August and September with the big league club. Exhibiting knowledge of the strike zone and an ability to make contact, he reduced his strikeout totals and produced a combined .376 on-base percentage. He also drove in 63 runs, hitting .323 with runners in scoring position, and was selected to participate in the All-Star Futures Game played at Chicago&#x27;s U.S. Cellular Field. From 2001 to 2003, the Venezuelan slugger batted a combined .330 with 40 home runs and 194 RBI.

====2004====
In his first full major league season, Martínez hit .283 with 23 home runs and 108 RBI in 141 games as the Indians&#x27; starting catcher for 2004. His 108 RBI set a record for Indians catchers. He also earned his first All-Star selection, and shared the Silver Slugger honor as the top-hitting American League catcher with Iván Rodríguez. For the first time since the awards began in 1980, there was a tie at one position. On July 16, Martínez also had the best offensive night by an Indians catcher in franchise history; he hit three home runs, singled twice, drew a walk, and drove in a career-high seven runs in a perfect 5-for-5 game against the Seattle Mariners.

====2005====
At the end of Cleveland&#x27;s game on June 11, 2005, Martínez was batting .207. However, he turned his season around in the second half, batting .380 (100-for-263) after the All-Star break, the best for any Major League player in that stretch. He finished the season with a .305 average, 20 home runs and 80 RBI in 147 games.

====2006====
Beginning in 2006, the Indians occasionally played Martínez at first base. As a catcher in 2006, he allowed 100 stolen bases, the most in Major League Baseball. He had a successful season at the plate, hitting .316 with 37 doubles, 16 home runs and 93 RBI in 153 games.

====2007====
In 2007, Martínez hit .301 with 25 home runs and led all major league catchers with a career-high 114 RBI in 147 games. He finished seventh in the American League MVP voting, and also made his second AL All-Star team. The Indians won the American League Central, marking Martínez&#x27;s first postseason appearance. In his postseason debut in Game 1 of the 2007 American League Division Series, he finished the game 3-for-5 with a home run, a double and 2 RBI in Cleveland&#x27;s 12–3 win over the New York Yankees. Martínez went on to bat .353 with a home run and 4 RBI in the four-game series victory. In the 2007 American League Championship Series, Martínez hit .296 with a home run and 3 RBI in Cleveland&#x27;s seven-game defeat to the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox.

====2008====
The 2008 season was an injury-marred season for Martínez. In Cleveland&#x27;s first game of the season on March 31 against the Chicago White Sox, he exited the game in the second inning with left hamstring tightness. He made his return to the starting lineup on April 7, finishing 2-for-4 with an RBI double in a 6–4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. From April 17 to May 4, Martínez posted a 15-game hitting streak in which he batted .344 with five doubles and 5 RBI. After batting .350 in April, Martínez subsequently hit .221 in May and .200 in June. On June 13, he underwent successful arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow, which had been bothering him in mid-May. On August 29, Martínez was activated from the disabled list. He finished the season with a then career-low .278 batting average, two home runs and 35 RBI in 73 games.

====2009====
On June 19, 2009, Martínez hit his 100th career home run against Rich Harden of the Chicago Cubs. On July 5, he was selected to represent Cleveland in the 2009 All-Star Game, his third career selection. In 99 games before being traded, Martínez batted .284 with 15 home runs and 67 RBI. His departure from the Indians created a public relations problem for the ballclub. The team had scheduled two separate Martínez-related promotional giveaways (bobbleheads on August 1, chest protector backpacks five days later) for dates subsequent to the transaction. Despite the trade, both promotions went off as planned.

===Boston Red Sox (2009–2010)===
====2009====
On July 31, 2009, Martínez was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Justin Masterson, Nick Hagadone, and Bryan Price. Martínez made his debut with the Red Sox on August 1, starting at first base and finishing the game 1-for-5 with an RBI single in Boston&#x27;s 4–0 win over the Baltimore Orioles. In his second game on August 2, he recorded five hits and 4 RBI in an 18–10 rout of the Orioles. After joining the Red Sox, Martínez played both first base and catcher, splitting time behind the plate with Red Sox captain Jason Varitek. His combined totals for the 2009 season (with Cleveland and Boston) included a .303 batting average, 23 home runs, and 108 RBI in 155 games. He also established a career high in walks, with 75. In the 2009 American League Division Series, Martínez hit just .182 with 2 RBI as the Red Sox were swept by the Angels. Following the season, the Red Sox exercised his 2010 option for $7.1 million.

====2010====
On June 27, 2010 against the San Francisco Giants, Martínez suffered a fractured left thumb, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He was activated on July 26, and was placed back into the starting lineup for Boston&#x27;s game against the Angels that night, hitting an RBI single in his first at-bat. He was limited to 127 games, finishing the 2010 season with a .302 batting average, 20 home runs, and 79 RBI. He was also named to his fourth career All-Star Game. 

===Detroit Tigers (2011–18)===
====2011====
On November 23, 2010, Martínez and the Detroit Tigers organization reached an agreement on a four-year, $50 million free agent contract. On March 31, 2011, Martínez made his debut for the Tigers as a designated hitter against the New York Yankees, going 1-for-4 in the 6–3 loss. Martínez was used almost exclusively as a designated hitter for the 2011 season, playing only 26 games at catcher and six games at first base. He had a slow start to the season, batting .250 in the month of April with two home runs, but he then batted .337 in May and .370 in June. On September 11, in a game at home against the Minnesota Twins, he had perhaps his worst-ever game at the plate, going 0-for-4 and hitting into four double plays (three of them GIDPs, one a line drive); his team managed to win anyway, 2–1. It was the first time a batter had hit into four double plays in the American League since Hall of Famer Goose Goslin did so in 1934, also while playing for the Tigers, and also in a game the Tigers won, 4–1. Although his power numbers were down, with only 12 home runs all season, Martínez posted his best career batting average (.330, good for fourth-best in the American League), tied his career high with 40 doubles, and had his fourth career 100+ RBI season (103, tied for 10th in the AL). He also led the Major Leagues in batting average with runners in scoring position, hitting .394. In the 2011 postseason, Martínez batted .250 with two home runs, a triple, 5 RBI and five walks in 11 games, helping the Tigers to the ALCS. The Tigers would lose the series to the Texas Rangers in six games.

====2012====
Martínez tore his ACL during off-season training in Lakeland, Florida and missed the entire 2012 season. On March 12, Martínez was placed on the 60-day disabled list. On June 22, owner Mike Ilitch optimistically reported that Martínez&#x27;s rehab was progressing better than expected, and speculated that he might rejoin the Tigers in August or September. However, on August 17, athletic trainer Kevin Rand officially announced that Martínez would in fact not return for the 2012 season, and that his rehab would instead target a return in 2013.

====2013====
Martínez started slowly in 2013. Through the end of June, he was hitting just .232. From July 1 onward, however, he hit at a .367 clip, contributing to a final line of .301, 14 home runs and 83 RBI in 159 games. It marked the sixth season that Martínez topped .300, and he also set career highs in hits (182) and at-bats (605). He continued to play well in the 2013 postseason, batting .405 with four doubles, a home run and 5 RBI in 11 games, but the Tigers eventually lost the ALCS in six games to the Boston Red Sox. 

====2014====
Entering the 2014 season, new Tigers manager Brad Ausmus indicated that he wanted Martínez to be prepared to catch, particularly during interleague games in a National League ballpark where there is no designated hitter. Martínez had the best statistical year of his career in 2014, setting career highs in several hitting categories.

On April 23, 2014, Martínez singled in the ninth inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox for his 1,500th career hit. On July 6, Martínez was selected in the player voting to participate in his fifth AL All-Star game, and his first as a Tiger. Martínez did not participate in the All-Star game due to side soreness, and was replaced by teammate Ian Kinsler. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 27, Martínez hit his 26th home run of the 2014 season, establishing a new career high. His previous high mark was 25 home runs for the Cleveland Indians in 2007.

Martínez was named the American League Player of the Month for August 2014. Martínez tied for the Major League lead in hits with 41 in the month, along with a .350 batting average in 31 games. Martínez slugged at a .547 clip in August, hitting six home runs and driving in a league-leading 30 runs. He also had 14 multi-hit games and was third in the AL in on-base percentage (.442) thanks to 19 walks.

Martínez finished the 2014 regular season with a career-high .335 batting average (second-best in the American League), 33 doubles and 103 RBI, while setting career highs with 188 hits and 32 home runs. He led the major leagues in OPS (.974) and intentional walks (28), and also led the American League with a .409 on-base percentage. Victor led the Tigers with 70 walks, and struck out only 42 times. He became the third player since 1990 to have 30 or more home runs, and 42 or fewer strikeouts, following Barry Bonds in 2004 and Gary Sheffield in 1992, and the first Tiger to do so since 1901. Martínez was 93-for-276 with two strikes, a .337 average, the second best two-strike average since 1914. On November 4, 2014, the BBWAA announced that Martínez was one of the three finalists for the American League MVP Award, along with Michael Brantley and Mike Trout. He finished second to Trout in the voting. On November 6, 2014, it was announced that Martínez won his second Silver Slugger Award, as the top-hitting American League designated hitter. Martínez was awarded the Edgar Martínez Award for 2014.

Martinez became a free agent after the 2014 season. On November 12, 2014, the Tigers re-signed Martínez to a four-year, $68 million contract.

====2015====
On February 5, 2015, it was announced that Martínez had suffered a torn medial meniscus in his left knee during offseason workouts. Martínez underwent successful surgery on his knee, and was expected to rejoin the team by the start of the regular season. Martínez did start the season, but reaggravated the left knee injury a couple weeks into April and began to struggle at the plate. In a game on May 18, Martínez landed clumsily at first base while running out a ground ball, tweaking the knee again. The Tigers put him on the 15-day disabled list the next day. At the time, he was hitting .216 with just four extra-base hits (three doubles, one home run) in 111 at-bats. He hit particularly poorly from the left side (.141 average in 85 at-bats), being unable to put weight on his back knee without pain. Martínez returned to the Tiger lineup on June 19 in a game against the New York Yankees.

On September 23, 2015, Martínez hit his 200th career home run, against Frankie Montas of the Chicago White Sox, becoming the sixth Venezuelan to reach the milestone. The injury-marred 2015 season led to a career-low .245 batting average with 11 home runs and 64 RBI in 120 games. For the season, Martinez hit .348 as a right-handed batter, but just .219 as a left-hander. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.4 feet/second.

====2016====
On April 6, 2016, Martínez became the first player in modern Major League history to hit a pinch-hit home run in his team&#x27;s first two regular-season games of the season. He was the first player to do so since at least 1914, and the only player to achieve this feat hitting one home run from each side of the plate. On April 20, Martínez recorded his 1,000th career RBI, becoming the fifth Venezuelan-born player in MLB history to reach the milestone.

Martínez was named the American League Player of the Week for the week ending May 1, 2016. Martinez batted .519 (14-for-27) for the week with three home runs, five doubles, 8 RBIs and eight runs scored. It was the first Player of the Week award for Martínez since May 15, 2011, and his fifth award overall. On May 11 against the Washington Nationals during Max Scherzer&#x27;s 20-strikeout game, Martínez still managed to finish the game 3-for-4. On June 16 against the Kansas City Royals, Martinez hit three home runs in a game for the second time in his career. The first two came from the right side of the plate against Royals starter Danny Duffy, and the third was hit from the left side against reliever Chien-Ming Wang. Victor&#x27;s only other three-homer game came on July 16, 2004, against the Seattle Mariners. Martínez became the first Tigers player to hit a home run from each side of the plate in the same game since Carlos Guillén in 2009.

Martinez finished the 2016 season with a .289 batting average, 27 home runs and 86 RBI in 154 games. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.6 feet/second.

==== 2017 ====
On June 15, 2017, Martínez was replaced with a pinch runner in the seventh inning after complaining about a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and cold sweats. He ended up hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat and was placed on the 10-day disabled list the next day.

On July 7, Martínez recorded his 2,000th career hit with a single off Carlos Carrasco of the Cleveland Indians, becoming the ninth active player to reach the milestone.

On August 27, Martínez was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to the irregular heartbeat symptoms returning. On September 2, it was revealed that Martínez would undergo cardiovascular surgery due to his irregular heartbeat, effectively ending his 2017 season. He played in 107 games in 2017, hitting .255 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI. He had the second-slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.6 feet/second.

==== 2018 ====
Having undergone successful cardiovascular surgery and treatment, Martínez participated in a full 2018 spring training and began the season as the Tigers&#x27; designated hitter. After struggling much of the 2018 season, Martínez stated on August 15 that 2018 would more than likely be his last in major league baseball. He said that he was just going to enjoy the last six weeks, and then go home to his cattle ranch in central Florida, where he now lives. The Cleveland Indians, where Martínez started his career and played for eight seasons, honored him before a game on September 15 in one of his last games in Cleveland before his announced retirement. The Tigers announced on September 19 that they would have a ceremony for him before the game on September 22. Martínez then announced that the game would be his final one so that he would take his last at-bat in front of his home crowd. After the pre-game ceremony, Martínez started the game at first base for the first time since 2016 at his request. He then beat out an infield single in his final at-bat in the bottom of the first inning, and was replaced with a pinch runner. As he walked off the field, he was greeted by teammates and two players from the Kansas City Royals gave him a hug.

In his final season, Martínez hit .251 with nine home runs and 54 RBI in 133 games. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league designated hitters, at 23.2 feet/second. When he retired in 2018, he was seventh among active players in RBI (1,178) and intentional walks (119).

====Career statistics====
In 1,973 games over 16 seasons, Martinez posted a .295 batting average (2,153-for-7,297) with 914 runs, 423 doubles, 246 home runs, 1,178 RBI, 730 walks, .360 on-base percentage, and .455 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded an overall .993 fielding percentage playing 858 games at catcher and 214 games at first base. He was productive in postseason play, batting .315 (47-for-149) in 39 games, with 22 runs, eight doubles, six home runs, 22 RBI and 11 walks.

==Post-playing career==
Martinez founded a cattle operation called Victoria&#x27;s Ranch at the end of his baseball career. In 2020, his horse King Guillermo won the Tampa Bay Derby at odds of 49/1.

On February 16, 2023, Martínez joined the front office of the Toronto Blue Jays as a special advisor.

<text>Kenneth Bancroft Clark (July 24, 1914 – May 1, 2005) and Mamie Phipps Clark (April 18, 1917 – August 11, 1983) were American psychologists who as a married team conducted research among children and were active in the Civil Rights Movement. They founded the Northside Center for Child Development in Harlem and the organization Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU). Kenneth Clark was also an educator and professor at City College of New York, and first Black president of the American Psychological Association.

They were known for their 1940s experiments using dolls to study children&#x27;s attitudes about race. The Clarks testified as expert witnesses in &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; (1952), one of five cases combined into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954). The Clarks&#x27; work contributed to the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court in which it determined that &quot;de jure&quot; racial segregation in public education was unconstitutional. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; opinion, &quot;To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.&quot;

==Mamie Phipps Clark==
===Early life===
The oldest of three children, two girls and one boy, Mamie Phipps was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, to Harold and Katie Phipps. Her father was a doctor, a native of the British West Indies. Her father also supplemented his income as a manager at a nearby vacation resort. Her mother helped him in his practice and encouraged both their children in education. Her brother became a dentist. Even though Phipps Clark grew up during the Depression and a time of racism and segregation, she had a privileged childhood. Her father&#x27;s occupation and income allowed them to live a middle-class lifestyle and even got them into some White-only parts of town. Phipps Clark, however, still attended segregated elementary and secondary schools, graduating from Pine Bluff&#x27;s Langston High School in 1934 at only 16 years old. This upbringing gave her a unique perspective on how society treated White and Black people differently. This realization contributed to her future research of racial identity in Black children. Despite the small number of opportunities for Black students to pursue higher education, Phipps Clark was offered several scholarships for college. Phipps Clark received scholarship offers from two of the most prestigious Black universities at that time, Fisk University in Tennessee and Howard University in Washington D.C.

Francis Sumner allowed her to work part-time in the psychology department where she expanded her knowledge about psychology. During her senior year in 1937 Kenneth, another mentee of Sumner&#x27;s, and Mamie Clark got married; they had to elope because her mother did not want her to get married before she graduated. A year later, she earned her B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in psychology (1938). Both Kenneth and Mamie went on for additional study at Columbia University. They later had two children together, Katie Miriam and Hilton Bancroft.

In the fall of 1938 Mamie Clark went to graduate school at Howard University to get a master&#x27;s degree in psychology and while she was enrolled her father would send her an allowance of fifty dollars a month. The summer following her undergraduate graduation Mamie worked for Charles Houston as a secretary at his law office. At the time, Houston was a popular civil rights lawyer and Mamie was privileged to see lawyers such as Thurgood Marshall come into the office to work on important cases. She admits that she did not think anything could be done about segregation and racial oppression until after this experience. Believing in a tangible end to segregation inspired Phipps Clark&#x27;s future studies, the results of which would help lawyers, such as Houston and Marshall, to win the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court case in 1954.
While working on her master&#x27;s degree, Phipps Clark became increasingly interested in developmental psychology. The inspiration for her thesis came from working at an all Black nursery school. She contacted psychologists Ruth and Gene Horowitz for advice. At the time they were conducting psychological studies about self-identification in young children and suggested that she conduct similar research with her nursery school children. Her master&#x27;s thesis was entitled &quot;The Development of Consciousness of Self in Negro Pre-School Children.&quot; This thesis was the basis from what would later become the Clarks&#x27; famous doll study on racial preference. Her husband Kenneth was fascinated by her thesis research and after her graduation they worked together on the research. They developed new and improved versions of the color and doll tests used in her thesis for a proposal to further the research. In 1939 they received a three-year Rosenwald Fellowship for their research that allowed them to publish three articles on the subject and also permitted Phipps Clark to pursue a doctoral degree at Columbia University.

During her time at Columbia, Mamie was the only black student pursuing a doctorate in psychology and she had a faculty adviser, Dr. Henry Garrett, who believed in segregation. Despite their differences in beliefs, Phipps Clark was able to complete her dissertation, &quot;Changes in Primary Mental Abilities with Age.&quot; In 1943, Mamie Phipps Clark was the first African-American women to earn a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University. She was the second Black person to receive a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University, following her husband Kenneth.

=== Career ===
After Phipps Clark graduated, she struggled being a psychologist as an African-American woman living in New York. She found it difficult to get a job; she lost some opportunities to less qualified White men and women. In the summer of 1939, Mamie took one of her first jobs as a secretary in the legal office of African-American lawyer Charles Hamilton Houston. This law firm involved the planning of legal action that would challenge the segregation laws. In 1944, she found a job through a family friend at the American Public Health Association analyzing research about nurses, which she hated. She stayed at that job for one year but was grossly overqualified for the position, which she found embarrassing. She then obtained a position at the United States Armed Forces Institute as a research psychologist but she still felt pigeonholed. In 1945 she was able to get a better job working for the United States Armed Forces Institute as a research psychologist; but, as World War II ended they did not feel the need to employ her anymore. She was fired in 1946. Later that year, Phipps Clark got a job in New York at the Riverdale Children&#x27;s Association where she saw potential to perform meaningful work. Founded by Quakers in 1836 as the Colored Orphan Asylum, in 1944, just two years before Dr. Clark arrived, the then 108 year old institution had changed its name. At Riverdale, she conducted psychological tests and counseled young, homeless Black people. While there, she saw first hand how insufficient psychological services were for minority children. Many of the children were being called mentally retarded by the state but Clark tested them and found they had IQs above then accepted levels for such claims. She saw society&#x27;s segregation as the cause for gang warfare, poverty, and low academic performance of minorities. This was a &quot;kick start&quot; to her life&#x27;s work and led to her most significant contributions in the field of developmental psychology.

Kenneth and Mamie Clark decided to try to improve social services for troubled youth in Harlem as there were virtually no mental-health services in the community. Kenneth Clark was then an assistant professor at the City College of New York and Phipps Clark was a psychological consultant doing testing at the Riverdale Children&#x27;s Association. Kenneth Bancroft Clark and Mamie Phipps Clark approached social service agencies in New York City urging them to expand their programs to provide social work, psychological evaluation, and remediation for youth in Harlem. None of the agencies took up their proposal. The Clarks &quot;realized that we were not going to get a child guidance clinic opened that way. So we decided to open it ourselves.&quot;

Together in 1946 the Clarks created the Northside Center for Child Development, originally called the Northside Testing and Consultation Center. They started in a one-room basement apartment of the Dunbar Houses on 158th Street (Manhattan). Two years later in 1948, Northside moved to 110th Street, across from Central Park, on the sixth floor of what was then the New Lincoln School. In 1974, Northside moved to Schomburg Plaza. As of 2023, Northside continues to serve Harlem children and their families from its center at the intersection of E. 108th Street and Park Avenue, New York.

The Clark&#x27;s goal was to match or surpass for poor African Americans, the mental health services then available for other children. Northside provided a homelike environment for poor Black children that provided pediatric and psychological help. It served as a location for initial experiments on racial biases in education and the intersection of education and varying theories and practices around social psychology. The psychological work they did led them to the conclusion that the problems of minority children are &quot;neither purely psychiatric, purely social, nor purely environmental, but psychosocial.&quot; Northside was the first center that offered psychological services to minority families around Harlem.

Mamie remained the director of the Northside Center for 33 years. Upon her retirement, Dora Johnson, a staff member at Northside, captured the importance of Mamie Clark to Northside. &quot;Mamie Clark embodied the center. In a very real way, it was her views, philosophy, and her soul that held the center together&quot;. She went on to say that &quot;when an unusual and unique person pursues a dream and realizes that dream and directs that dream, people are drawn not only to the idea of the dream, but to the uniqueness of the person themselves.&quot; Her vision of social, economic, and psychological advancement of African-American children resonates far beyond the era of integration.

Phipps Clark did not limit her contributions to her Northside work. She was a very involved member of the community. She was on the boards of directors for several community organizations, along with being involved with the Youth Opportunities Unlimited Project and the initiation of the Head Start Program. She also volunteered in the psychiatric clinic of the Domestic Relations Court while she was completing her doctorate at Columbia and went on to teach at Yeshiva University.

One of Phipps Clark&#x27;s early, published studies was titled &quot;The Development of Consciousness of Self and the Emergence of Racial Identification in Negro Preschool Children.&quot; This research was an investigation of early level of conscious racial identity in Black preschool children. The study included 150 Black children from segregated, nursery schools in Washington, D.C. with 50% of the participants being girls and 50% boys. There were 50 three-year-old, 50 four-year-old, and 50 five-year-old children in the study. Each participant was shown a set of pictures that included a white boy, a black boy, a lion, a dog, a clown, and a hen. The participants were asked to point to the drawing that represented who or what they were asked about. An example of this procedure would be a Black boy being asked to point to his cousin or brother. The results showed that the group tended to choose the drawing with a black child over the white child but as age increased, there was still some increase in the ratio of those identifying with black over white. Their finding indicated that a great amount of self-conscious development and racial identity happens between ages three and fours years old. Once past four years old, this identification with the Black boy plateaus. This plateau may imply that the picture study is not sensitive enough for children over four. It also suggests that maybe five-year-old children have reached a self-awareness and now see themselves in an intrinsic way and are less capable of external representations.

=== Legacy ===
Phipps Clark&#x27;s work provided key contributions to the fields of developmental psychology and the psychology of race by shedding light on the impact of racial discrimination. She made lasting contributions at the United States Armed Forces Institute and the Public Health Association. Her unrelenting research on the identity and self-esteem of Black people expanded work on identity development.

Clark is not as famous as her husband. It has been noted that she adhered to feminine expectations of the time and often took care to &quot;remain in the shadows of her husband&#x27;s limelight&quot;. She often presented as shy. It should also be noted, that Phipps Clark&#x27;s tendency to remain in her husband&#x27;s shadow occurred in the backdrop of blatant sexism and racism in the psychological field and it is believed that the extent of her contributions was significantly downplayed.

Together, the Clarks devoted their entire lives to improving the mental health of Black people. For her contributions, Phipps Clark received a Candace Award for Humanitarianism from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1983.

Phipps Clark retired in 1979 and died of lung cancer on August 11, 1983, at 66 years old at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. In addition to her husband, Phipps Clark was survived by her daughter, Kate Harris of Hastings-on-Hudson; her son, Hilton, of Manhattan, and her brother, Harold Phipps of Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

==Kenneth Clark==

===Early life and education===
Kenneth Clark was born in the Panama Canal Zone to Arthur Bancroft Clark and Miriam Hanson Clark. His father worked as an agent for the United Fruit Company. When he was five, his parents separated and his mother took him and his younger sister Beulah to the US to live in Harlem in New York City. Miriam Clark worked as a seamstress in a sweatshop, where she later organized a union and became a shop steward for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Kenneth Clark arrived in New York City as ethnic diversity of Harlem was disappearing such that his elementary school was predominantly black. Clark noted that he first &quot;became aware of color&quot; when he was taught by a black teacher, who happened to be Hubert Thomas Delaney. Clark was to be trained to learn a trade, as were most black students at the time. Miriam wanted more for her son and transferred him to George Washington High School in Upper Manhattan. Clark graduated from high school in 1931 (Jones &amp; Pettigrew, 2005).

Clark attended Howard University, a historically black university, where he first studied political science with professors including Ralph Johnson Bunche. During his years at Howard University, he worked under the influence of mentor Francis Cecil Sumner, the first African American to receive a doctorate in psychology. He returned in 1935 for a master&#x27;s in psychology. Clark was a distinguished member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. After earning his master&#x27;s degree, Sumner directed Clark to Columbia University to work with another influential mentor, Otto Klineberg (Jones &amp; Pettigrew, 2005).

While studying psychology for his doctorate at Columbia, Clark did research in support of the study of race relations by Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal, who wrote &quot;An American Dilemma&quot;. In 1940, Clark was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University.

===Career===
During the summer of 1941, after Clark was already asked to teach a summer session at City College of New York, the Dean of Hampton Institute in Virginia asked Clark to start a department of psychology there. In 1942 Kenneth Clark would become the first African-American tenured, full professor at the City College of New York. Clark also managed to start a psychology department at Hampton Institute in 1942 and taught a few courses within the department. In 1966 he was the first African American appointed to the New York State Board of Regents and the first African American to be president of the American Psychological Association.

Much of Clark&#x27;s work came as a response to his involvement in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education US Supreme Court desegregation decision. Lawyers Jack Greenberg and Robert L. Carter, with resources and funding from the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and Topeka Jewish Community Relations Bureau, hired Clark to present his work on the effects of segregation on children. After the Brown v. Board of Education case, Clark was still dissatisfied by the lack of progress in school desegregation in New York City. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot;, Clark expressed his doubts about the efficacy of certain busing programs in desegregating the public schools. Clark also felt very discouraged by the lack of social welfare organizations to address race and poverty issues. Clark argued that a new approach had to be developed to involve poor blacks, in order to gain the political and economic power needed to solve their problems. Clark called his new approach &quot;internal colonialism&quot;, with hope that the Kennedy-Johnson administration&#x27;s War on Poverty would address problems of increasing social isolation, economic dependence and declining municipal services for many African Americans (Freeman, 2008).

Clark in 1962 was among the founders of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), an organization devoted to developing educational and job opportunities. With HARYOU, Clark conducted an extensive sociological study of Harlem. He measured IQ scores, crime frequency, age frequency of the population, drop-out rates, church and school locations, quality of housing, family incomes, drugs, STD rates, homicides, and a number of other areas. It recruited educational experts to help to reorganize Harlem schools, create preschool classes, tutor older students after school, and job opportunities for youth who dropped out. The Johnson administration earmarked more than $100 million for the organization. When it was placed under the administration of a pet project of Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in 1964, the two men clashed over appointment of a director and its direction.

Clark used HARYOU to press for changes to the educational system to help improve black children&#x27;s performance. While he at first supported decentralization of city schools, after a decade of experience, Clark believed that this option had not been able to make an appreciable difference and described the experiment as a &quot;disaster&quot;.

Following race riots in the summer of 1967, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson appointed the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (Kerner Commission). The Commission called Clark among the first experts to testify on urban issues. In 1973, Clark testified in the trial of Ruchell Magee for his role in the Marin County Civic Center attacks.

Clark retired from City College in 1975, but remained an active advocate for integration throughout his life, serving on the board of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, of which he was Chairman Emeritus until his death. He opposed separatists and argued for high standards in education, continuing to work for children&#x27;s benefit. He consulted to city school systems across the country, and argued that all children should learn to use Standard English in school.

Clark died in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York in May 2005. He was 90.

== The Coloring Test ==
The coloring test was another experiment that was involved in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. Mamie and Kenneth did this experiment in order to investigate the development of racial identity in African American children and examine how a negro child’s color and &quot;their sense of their own race and status&quot; influenced &quot;their judgment about themselves&quot; and their &quot;self esteem.&quot; The coloring test was administered to 160 African American children between the ages of five and seven years old. The children were given a piece of coloring paper with a leaf, an apple, an orange, a mouse, a boy and a girl on it. They were all given a box of crayons and asked to first color the mouse to make sure they had a basic understanding of the relationship between color and object. If they pass, they were then asked to color a boy if they were a boy and a girl if they were a girl. They were told to color the boy or girl the color that they are. They were then told to color the opposite sex the color that they want that sex to be. The Clarks categorized the responses into reality responses (accurately colored their skin color), fantasy responses (very different from their skin color), and irrelevant responses (used bizarre colors like purple or green). The Clarks examined the reality and fantasy responses to conclude that children typically color themselves noticeably lighter than their actual color, while the phantasy responses reflect children trying through wishful thinking to escape their situation. Although 88% of the children did draw themselves brown or black, they oftentimes drew themselves a lighter shade than the mouse. Children that were older generally were more accurate at determining how dark they should be. When asked to color the picture of the child that was the opposite sex, 52% put either white or an irrelevant color.

== Doll experiments ==

The Clarks&#x27; doll experiments grew out of Mamie Clark&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree thesis. They published three major papers between 1939 and 1940 on children&#x27;s self-perception related to race. Their studies found contrasts among African-American children attending segregated schools in Washington, DC versus those in integrated schools in New York. The doll experiment involved a child being presented with two dolls. Both of these dolls were completely identical except for the skin and hair color. One doll was white with yellow hair, while the other was brown with black hair. The child was then asked questions inquiring as to which one is the doll they would play with, which one is the nice doll, which one looks bad, which one has the nicer color, etc. The experiment showed a clear preference for the white doll among all children in the study. One of the conclusions from the study is that a Black child by the age of five is aware that to be &quot;colored in American society is a mark of inferior status.&quot; This study was titled, &quot;Emotional Factors in Racial Identification and Preference in Negro Children,&quot; and was not created with public policy or the Supreme Court in mind, lending credibility to its objectiveness. The study was published only in the &quot;Journal of Negro Education&quot; before appearing before the Court. These findings exposed internalized racism in African-American children, self-hatred that was more acute among children attending segregated schools. This research also paved the way for an increase in psychological research into areas of self-esteem and self-concept.

This work suggests that by its very nature, segregation harms children and, by extension, society at large, a suggestion that was exploited in several legal battles. The Clarks testified as expert witnesses in several school desegregation cases, including &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot;, which was later combined into the famous &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954). In 1954, Clark and Isidor Chein wrote a brief whose purpose was to supply evidence in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case underlining the damaging effects racial segregation had on African-American children. &quot;Brown v. Board&quot; was a test case supported by the NAACP to end the precedent of legal segregation when conditions are &quot;separate but equal,&quot; established by the case &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; in 1896. In a 9–0 decision for Brown, the Court decided that segregation based on race in public schools violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. 

The Supreme Court declared that separate but equal in education was unconstitutional because it resulted in African American children having &quot;a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community.&quot; The Doll Study is cited in the 11th footnote of the Brown decision to provide updated and &quot;ample&quot; psychological support to the Kansas case. The Brown decision quotes that, &quot;segregation of white and colored children in public schools has detrimental effect upon the colored children&quot; and this sense of inferiority &quot;affects the motivation of a child to learn.&quot; The evidence provided by Clark helped end segregation in the public school systems. Regarding Brown, this question of psychological and psychic harm fit into a very particular historical window that allowed it to have formal traction in the first place. It was not until a few decades prior (with the coming of Boas and other cultural anthropologists) that cultural and social-science research—and the questions that they invoked—would even be consulted by the courts and therefore able to influence decisions.

=== Response to Doll tests ===
Not everyone accepted the Doll tests as valid scientific studies. Henry E. Garrett, Mamie Clark’s former professor and advisor at Columbia, was an avid supporter of segregation and a witness in &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, VA (&quot;one of the five court cases that combined to form &quot;Brown v. Board).&quot; Garrett argued that no tests could adequately gauge a student’s attitudes toward segregation, and that the Clarks’ tests in Virginia were biased and had too small of a sample size. Garrett advocated in his Virginia school board testimony that if a negro child had access to equal facilities surrounded by his own teachers and friends, &quot;he would be more likely to develop pride in himself as a Negro, which I think we would all like to see him do – to develop his own potential, his sense of duty…&quot; and Garrett even claimed that they would &quot;prefer to remain as a Negro group&quot; instead of mixing and facing hostility, animosity, and inferiority. Garrett and his colleague Wesley C. George’s 1964 letter to the &quot;Science&quot; journal further questioned the Brown decision, claiming the only reference to science in the entire decision is in footnote 11. Garrett and George argue that the Court overlooked the &quot;mental difference&quot; between races, and that Clark’s evidence was invalid and misleading because &quot;integration, not segregation, injured the Negro child’s self-image.&quot; In an alternative interpretation of the Clark doll experiments, Robin Bernstein has recently argued that the children&#x27;s rejection of the black dolls could be understood not as victimization or an expression of internalized racism but instead as resistance against violent play involving black dolls, which was a common practice when the Clarks conducted their tests. Historian Daryl Scott also critiqued the logic of the Doll Study, because contemporary studies suggest that black children with greater contact with whites experience more psychological distress. The Clark Doll Study was influential scientific evidence for the Brown v. Board decision, but a few academics questioned the study.

In 2005, filmmaker Kiri Davis recreated the doll study and documented it in a film entitled &quot;A Girl Like Me&quot;. Despite the many changes in some parts of society, Davis found the same results as did the Drs. Clark in their study of the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the original experiments, the majority of the children chose the white dolls. When Davis repeated the experiment 15 out of 21 children also chose the white dolls over the black doll.

CNN recreated the doll study in 2010 with cartoons of five children, each with different shades of skin color. The experiment was designed by Margaret Beale Spencer, a child psychologist and University of Chicago professor. Children were asked to answer the same doll test questions, such as &quot;who is the nice child&quot; or &quot;who has the skin color most adults like&quot; and choose between the cartoon people arranged in order of lightest to darkest skin. The results were interpreted as indicating &quot;white bias,&quot; meaning that children (mostly white, but also &quot;black children as a whole have some bias&quot;) continue to associate positive attributes with lighter skin tones, and negative attributes with darker skin tones.

==Family==
The Clarks had two children: a son Hilton and daughter Kate. During the Columbia University protests of 1968, Hilton was a leader of the Society of Afro-American Students; his father negotiated between them and the university administration. The Clarks were happily married for forty-five years, until Mamie&#x27;s death. Kate Clark Harris directed the Northside Center for Child Development for four years after her mother&#x27;s death.

A &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report in the 1970s noted that the Clarks, who supported integration and desegregation busing, moved to Westchester County in 1950 because of concerns about failing public schools in the city. Kenneth Clark said: &quot;My children have only one life and I could not risk that.&quot;

<text>John Walker FRSE (1731–1803) was a Scottish minister and natural historian. He was Regius Professor of Natural history at the University of Edinburgh from 1779 to 1803. He was joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783 and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1790.

==Overview==

Walker was a protégé of the chemist William Cullen and a colleague of Dugald Stewart, Joseph Black and several other Edinburgh professors who shaped the intellectual milieu of the Scottish Enlightenment. During his long career, he became a distinguished botanist, chemist, geologist, hydrologist, meteorologist, mineralogist, zoologist and economic historian, as well as being a minister in the Church of Scotland.

Walker was one of the main scientific consultants of his day, serving as an agricultural, industrial or mining advisor to many influential Scottish landowners, including the judge advocate Lord Kames, George III&#x27;s prime minister Lord Bute, and Lord Hopetoun. Many of his students went on to become leading scientists in nineteenth century Scotland, England, Ireland, and America. He was a pioneer in introducing agricultural topics into a university curriculum.

As a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, Walker automatically became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783, going on to serve as Secretary of the Society&#x27;s Physical section (1789–96). He was elected as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1790.

== Early life ==

He was born in Canongate, Edinburgh the eldest son of Eupham Morison and John Walker the rector of the Canongate Grammar School. He was educated at his father&#x27;s school.

He matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in 1746. Like many aspiring men in Scotland at this time, he took a divinity degree in 1749. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright in 1754 but was not ordained into the Church of Scotland until 1758, initially being minister of Glencorse just south of Edinburgh, moving to Moffat in 1762 and to Lochmaben. He accepted the post of Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh in the same year and quickly found the two roles incompatible. In 1783 he returned to the church as minister of Colinton, a parish in south-west Edinburgh. Held in high esteem he was elected Moderator of the General Assembly in 1790. He lived in Colinton manse from 1783 to 1803. He became blind around 1800 but continued to preach until death.

However, his religious duties did not stop him from pursuing scientific subjects in his spare time. While at university took natural philosophy courses and collected natural history specimens in and around the Lothians. During the 1750s he continued to pursue scientific subjects by studying chemistry under Professor William Cullen and by joining Edinburgh&#x27;s Philosophical Society. He distinguished himself not only by winning awards from the Society but also by publishing an article in the 1757 edition of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot;. Under Cullen&#x27;s patronage, Walker further distinguished himself as a chemist and a mineralogist and this led him to function as a scientific advisor for Lord Bute, Lord Hopetoun, Lord Cathcart, and Judge Advocate Lord Kames.

== Becoming a naturalist ==

During the 1760s he used his aristocratic connections to tour mines throughout the Lowlands and to assemble his own sizeable mineralogical collection. By the mid-1760s, Walker was known as one of Scotland&#x27;s leading lay naturalists. This motivated the Church of Scotland and the Board of Annexed Estates to send him on exploratory tours of the Highland and Hebrides in 1764 and 1771. These tours allowed him to make religious and ethnographic observations for the church and to take scientifically oriented notes on northern Scotland&#x27;s minerals, plants, animals, and climate. In his 1764 tour, while on visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island), Walker may have made the first detailed description of the Lyme disease. He gives a good description both of the symptoms (with &quot;exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs&quot;) and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a &quot;worm&quot; with a body which is &quot;of a reddish colour and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side&quot; that &quot;penetrates the skin&quot;. It was also during this period that he collected samples of the mineral which came to be known as strontianite from its type locality, thus setting in process the identification and analysis of the new alkaline earth Strontium.

During the 1770s Walker published articles in &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. By the mid part of the decade, it became clear that Robert Ramsay, the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s ailing Professor of Natural History, would soon need to be replaced. After securing the support of William Cullen, Lord Kames and several other politically savvy intellectuals, Walker competed against William Smellie, a well-respected natural historian and influential publisher, for the post. After much wrangling, Walker won the contest and was appointed in 1779. He held the position until his death in 1803.

== Later life ==

Walker&#x27;s natural history lectures spanned the academic year and were divided into two sections. The first half of the year he gave his &#x27;Hippocratean&#x27; lectures, that is, meteorology, hydrology and geology. The second half of the year was devoted to the three kingdoms of nature: minerals, plants, and animals. During the 1760s, he had accepted Linnaeus&#x27; binomial classification system and during his university tenure he readily applied it to botany. However, he did not agree with Linnaeus&#x27; classification of minerals and animals and therefore he developed his own unique system for both of these subjects. As shown by Matthew Daniel Eddy, Walker developed a sophisticated theory of the earth based on evidence gathered from geochemistry and human history. Throughout his entire career he kept his ties with the Church of Scotland and in 1790 he was elected to be Moderator, its highest position. Sometime in the late 1790s he began to lose his sight and several of his lectures were taken over by Dr Robert Jameson, a physician and former student who had also studied in mainland Europe. By the time that he died in 1803, Walker had taught well over 800 students, some of whom would go on to have a significant impact on 19th-century natural history. Some of these names include Rev. Prof. John Playfair, Sir James Edward Smith, Sir James Hall, Mungo Park, Robert Waring Darwin, Robert Brown, Thomas Beddoes, Thomas Charles Hope, and Samuel Latham Mitchell.

He died at his Edinburgh home at 1 St John Street on the Canongate on 31 December 1803, and is buried in Canongate Kirkyard on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, just east of the church building.

==Family==

In 1789 he married Jane Wallace Wauchope.

<text>An anthem without a title was the untitled anthem of the Netherlands Antilles. It was written in English by Zahira Hiliman from Sint Maarten and translated into the Papiamento language by Lucille Berry-Haseth from Curaçao. The anthem was written in two of the three official languages of the Netherlands Antilles, English and Papiamento. It was adopted in 2000. In addition to this one, many of the islands in the Netherlands Antilles had their own regional anthems.

On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved into Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the three public bodies of the Caribbean Netherlands.

1. Our island in the sea, like gems they seem to be,

outstanding from a golden crown of blissful royalty.

Though their people and their culture colorful may seem,

they yet uniquely blend to be just one family.

Bridge

So we, your people raise our voice in love and unity

Chorus

Dear Netherlands Antilles, so beautiful to me.

I’m proud to be a part of you, a patriot I shall be.

Yes Netherlands Antilles, I pledge my loyalty,

To you always will be true; I say may God bless you.

2. So blessed with sunny skies and clear welcoming seas,

each island like a link that forms this chain of unity.

May differ in our language, yet meet on common ground,

When some say &quot;Sweet Antilles&quot;, some say &quot;Dushi Antia ta&quot;.

3. Yes, proud are we to be identified with you,

dear Netherlands Antilles, to you we will be true.

So we declare and vow, with dignity and love,

Our nation we will always serve, may God keep us as one.

<text>Simvastatin, sold under the brand name Zocor among others, is a statin, a type of lipid-lowering medication. It is used along with exercise, diet, and weight loss to decrease elevated lipid levels. It is also used to decrease the risk of heart problems in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include constipation, headaches, and nausea. Serious side effects may include muscle breakdown, liver problems, and increased blood sugar levels. A lower dose may be needed in people with kidney problems. There is evidence of harm to the developing baby when taken during pregnancy and it should not be used by those who are breastfeeding. It is in the statin class of medications and works by decreasing the manufacture of cholesterol by the liver.
Simvastatin is made from the fungus &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot;. It was patented by Merck in 1980, and came into medical use in 1992. Simvastatin is available as a generic medication, and is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the nineteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 26million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
The primary uses of simvastatin are to treat dyslipidemia and to prevent atherosclerosis-related complications such as stroke and heart attacks in those who are at high risk. It is recommended to be used as an addition to a low-cholesterol diet.

In heart protection studies, simvastatin showed the ability to lower LDL cholesterol by about 1·5 mmol/L, which resulted in substantial reductions in mortality rates. Simvastatin also reduced the numbers of other events like heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations and MI significantly.

The Heart Protection Study evaluated the effects of simvastatin in people with risk factors including existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or stroke, but having relatively low LDL cholesterol. In this trial, which lasted 5.4 years, overall mortality was reduced by 13% and cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 18%. People receiving simvastatin experienced 38% fewer nonfatal heart attacks and 25% fewer strokes.

Statins in general have been proposed as beneficial in reducing the progression of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Multiple observational studies have been conducted to analyse the benefits of statin use in delaying the progression of AMD but have resulted in conflicting outcomes. Given the current available information, simvastatin should not be recommended solely for the treatment of AMD.

==Contraindications==
Simvastatin is contraindicated with pregnancy, breastfeeding, and liver disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on simvastatin due to potentially severe birth defects. Patients cannot breastfeed while on simvastatin due to potentially disrupting the infant&#x27;s lipid metabolism. High doses of simvastatin are also contraindicated with the widely used antihypertensive amlodipine. A lower dose is also recommended in people taking the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, as well as those taking amiodarone.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects (&gt;1% incidence) may include indigestion and eczema. There is evidence to suggest that rare side effects such as joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps are more likely to occur in patients who take higher doses of simvastatin. Cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system), and myositis have been reported in patients receiving the drug chronically. Serious allergic reactions to simvastatin are rare.

A type of DNA variant known as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may help predict individuals prone to developing myopathy when taking simvastatin; a study ultimately including 32,000 patients concluded the carriers of one or two risk alleles of a particular SNP, rs4149056, were at a five-fold or 16-fold increased risk, respectively. In 2012, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has released guidelines regarding the use of rs4149056 genotype in guiding dosing of simvastatin and updated the guideline in 2014.

In March 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its guidance for statin users to address reports of memory loss, liver damage, increased blood sugar, development of type 2 diabetes, and muscle injury. The new guidance indicates:
* FDA has found that liver injury associated with statin use is rare but can occur.
* The reports about memory loss, forgetfulness, and confusion span all statin products and all age groups. The FDA says these experiences are rare, but that those affected often report feeling &quot;fuzzy&quot; or unfocused in their thinking.
* A small increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes have been reported with the use of statins. A 2010 published meta-analysis found for every 255 patients taking a statin for 4 years, one additional case of diabetes would occur whilst preventing 5.4 major coronary events.
* Some drugs interact with statins in a way that increases the risk of muscle injury called myopathy, characterized by unexplained muscle weakness or pain.

On 19 March 2010, the FDA issued another statement regarding simvastatin, saying it increases the risk of muscle injury (myopathy) when taken at high doses or at lower doses in combination with other drugs. The highest dose rate causes muscle damage in 610 of every 10,000 people in contrast to a lower dose, which causes muscle damage in eight of 10,000 people. The FDA warning, released again on 8 June 2011, suggested that high-dose &quot;simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking this dose for 12 months or more without evidence of muscle injury&quot; and that it &quot;should not be started in new patients, including patients already taking lower doses of the drug.&quot;

== Interactions ==

Simvastatin has important interactions with grapefruit juice and other drugs, including some that are commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. These interactions are clinically important because increasing simvastatin serum levels above those normally provided by the maximum recommended dose increases the risk of muscle damage, including the otherwise rare and potentially fatal side effect of rhabdomyolysis.

Consuming large amounts of grapefruit juice increases serum levels of simvastatin by up to three-fold, increasing the risk of side effects. The FDA recommends that people taking statins should avoid consuming more than a quart (946 ml) of grapefruit juice per day.

Simvastatin also interacts with other drugs, including some used to treat cardiovascular problems. It should not be taken by people who are also taking the antifungal drugs fluconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole; the antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or telithromycin; HIV protease inhibitors; the antidepressant nefazodone; the cardiovascular drug gemfibrozil; the immunosuppressant ciclosporin, or the endometriosis drug danazol. Reduced maximum doses of simvastatin apply for patients taking certain other drugs, including the cardiovascular drugs verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, amlodipine, and ranolazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlInformation on Simvastatin/Amiodarone&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
All statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase. HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, the metabolic pathway responsible for the endogenous production of cholesterol. Statins are more effective than other lipid-regulating drugs at lowering LDL-cholesterol concentration, but they are less effective than the fibrates in reducing triglyceride concentration. However, statins reduce cardiovascular disease events and total mortality irrespective of the initial cholesterol concentration. This is a major piece of evidence that statins work in another way than the lowering of cholesterol (called pleiotropic effects).

Simvastatin is an effective serum lipid-lowering drug that can decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels by up to 50%. Simvastatin had been shown to interact with lipid-lowering transcription factor PPAR-alpha and that interaction might control the neurotrophic action of the drug.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
The drug is in the form of an inactive lactone that is hydrolyzed after ingestion to produce the active β-hydroxyacid form. Simvastatin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 yielding products which are also active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

==History==
The development of simvastatin was closely linked with lovastatin. Biochemist Jesse Huff and his colleagues at Merck began researching the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the early 1950s. In 1956, mevalonic acid was isolated from a yeast extract by Karl Folkers, Carl Hoffman, and others at Merck, while Huff and his associates confirmed that mevalonic acid was an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. In 1959, the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme (a major contributor of internal cholesterol production) was discovered by researchers at the Max Planck Institute. This discovery encouraged scientists worldwide to find an effective inhibitor of this enzyme.

By 1976, Akira Endo had isolated the first inhibitor, mevastatin, from the fungus &quot;Penicillium citrinium&quot; while working at Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. In 1979, Hoffman and colleagues isolated lovastatin from a strain of the fungus &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot;. While developing and researching lovastatin, Merck scientists synthetically derived a more potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor from a fermentation product of &quot;A. terreus&quot;, which was designated MK-733 (later to be named simvastatin).

In 1994, publication of the results of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) provided the first unequivocal evidence that lowering LDL cholesterol via statin treatment reduces cardiovascular events and overall mortality. A total of 4,444 people with coronary heart disease and blood cholesterol levels from 5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L were randomized to simvastatin treatment or placebo and followed for an average of 5 years. Compared to the placebo group, those treated with simvastatin experienced a 30% decrease in overall mortality, a 42% reduction in coronary death, a 34% reduction in major coronary events, and a 37% reduction in revascularization procedures.

==Society and culture==

=== Economics ===
Prior to losing US patent protection, simvastatin was Merck &amp; Co.&#x27;s largest-selling drug.

Under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States, health plans may cover the costs of simvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg for adults aged 40–75 years based on United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations.

Zocor had an original patent expiry date in December 2005, but was extended by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to expire in June 2006.

=== Brand names ===

Simvastatin was initially marketed by Merck &amp; Co under the brand name Zocor but is available generically in most countries following the patent expiry. A combination of simvastatin along with ezetimibe is sold under the brand name Vytorin and is jointly marketed by Merck and Schering-Plough.

Brand names include Zocor, Zocor Heart Pro, marketed by the pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co., Simlup, Simvotin, Simcard (India), Denan (Germany), Liponorm, Sinvacor, Sivastin (Italy), Lipovas (Japan), Lodales (France), Zocord (Austria and Sweden), Zimstat, Simvahexal (Australia), Lipex (Australia and New Zealand), Simvastatin-Teva, Simvacor, Simvaxon, Simovil (Israel), available in Thailand under the brand Bestatin manufactured by Berlin Pharmaceutical Industry Co Ltd and others.

<text>Farallón de Pájaros (from Spanish &quot;Farallón de Pájaros&quot;, meaning &quot;Birds&#x27; Sea Stack&quot;, see Stack (geology)), also known as Urracas (from Spanish &quot;Urracas&quot;, meaning &quot;Magpies&quot;), is a small (2.3 km2) uninhabited volcanic island, the northernmost island and also farthest west in the Northern Mariana Islands chain.

==History==
Farallón de Pájaros was ceded by Spain to Germany through the German–Spanish Treaty (1899), together with the rest of the Mariana Islands (except Guam). The formalities of the cession were carried out on November 17, 1899, in Saipan, for all the Northern Mariana Islands.

From 1899 to 1914, Farallón de Pájaros was controlled by the German Empire and was administered as part of the colony of German New Guinea. In 1903 the island was leased to a Japanese company, which hunted birds whose feathers were exported to Japan and then to Paris.

After World War I, the island was awarded to the Empire of Japan, by the League of Nations as part of the South Seas Mandate. After World War II, Farallón de Pájaros was awarded to the United States as part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and is currently administered as part of the Northern Islands Municipality of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

In 1985, per the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the island was designated as a wilderness area for the protection and conservation of natural resources. Since 2009, the island has been part of Marianas Trench Marine National Monument of the United States.

==Geography==
Farallón de Pájaros is the northernmost island of the Marianas chain. It is located northwest of the Maug Islands and north of Saipan, the main island of the Northern Mariana Islands. Its northern neighbor is South Iwo Jima of the Ogasawara Islands of Japan, located away.

Farallón de Pájaros is nearly circular, with a length of , a width of and has an area of . Farallón de Pájaros is the top of an active stratovolcano with a height of above sea level. The base of this stratovolcano is about below sea level, it has a diameter of 15 to 20 kilometers.

===Volcanic activity===
Between 1864 and 1953, 15 volcanic eruptions of Farallón de Pájaros have been recorded.

In the area of Farallón de Pájaros are two submarine volcanoes: The Makhahnas Seamount located about southwest, reaching a height of below sea level, and last erupted in 1967. The Ahyi Seamount located about south-east and reaches a height of below sea level. It is associated with a possible eruption in 1979, an eruption in 2001, and a series of underwater eruptions from 24 April to 17 May 2014, with hydrothermal activity continuing at least to December 2014.

===Important Bird Area===
The island has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Micronesian megapodes and sooty terns.

<doc id="635664" wikidata="Q4967282" url="?curid=635664" title="Briggs v. Elliott">
<text>Briggs v. Elliott, 342 U.S. 350 (1952), on appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina, challenged school segregation in Summerton, South Carolina. It was the first of the five cases combined into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the famous case in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional by violating the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause. Following the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, the district court issued a decree that struck down the school segregation law in South Carolina as unconstitutional and required the state&#x27;s schools to integrate. Harry and Eliza Briggs, Reverend Joseph A. DeLaine, and Levi Pearson were awarded Congressional Gold Medals posthumously in 2003.

==Background==

The case began in 1947 when Levi Pearson wrote a letter to the Clarendon County School District requesting that black children be provided with the same bus transportation that white children in the district received:

In Clarendon County, white children attended schools with a teacher for every grade, class sizes no higher than 30 students, brick schools with heat, indoor toilets, water fountains, modern textbooks, gyms, auditoriums and libraries. However, black children attended school in abandoned hunting or Masonic lodges and often drafty cabins adjacent to churches. Black children brought coal or wood to burn in oil drums for heat, and purchased textbooks that were discarded from white students. For restrooms, they dug and used privies and toted water from the local wells. One first grade teacher in Summerton handled 67 students; one second grade teacher was recorded as having a class of 79.

Prior to Levi Pearson&#x27;s letter, the school board reserved all of its 30 buses for white children. Because of this, Pearson&#x27;s children had a 9-mile journey, one-way, to attend the nearest black school. The black children of Clarendon County often had harsh commutes to attend school, including rowing paddle boats to cross bodies of water. In the neighboring Jordan community, some children walked up to 16 miles to and from school each day, and children had to frequently gather wood for heaters within schools. Levi, his brother, Hammett Pearson, and neighbor Joseph Lemon raised $700 to buy the local children a used school bus to use ($8,336 in today dollars), but frequent maintenance led them to ask the local school superintendent, Roderick M. Elliott, for their own bus. Elliott refused, saying that black citizens did not pay enough taxes to warrant a bus and that asking white taxpayers to fund that burden would be unfair.

To advance his efforts for safe transportation for black children, Pearson retained South Carolina attorney Harold Boulware and rising NAACP star Thurgood Marshall. Marshall argued that, since the local school board already provided bus transportation for white students, the county was in violation of the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s “separate but equal” decision in the &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; case. The case, which was brought against Clarendon County District 26 on behalf of Pearson&#x27;s son James, met with immediate resistance. As a result of his lawsuit, &quot;Pearson v. Clarendon County&quot;, Levi Pearson suffered from acts of domestic terror, such as gun shots fired into his home, as well as economic consequences: local banks refused to provide him with credit to purchase farming materials and area farmers refused to lend him equipment.

In 1948, &quot;Pearson v. Clarendon County&quot; was dismissed on a technicality when the superintendent noted that Pearson&#x27;s large property covered multiple district lines. When Levi Pearson&#x27;s brother, Hammett Pearson, learned of the issue, he offered to replace his brother in the lawsuit.

The rejection of &quot;Pearson v. Clarendon&quot; &quot;County&quot; caused the NAACP attorneys to pivot and raise their target to complete desegregation. In 1949, the NAACP agreed to provide funding and sponsor a case that would go beyond transportation and ask for equal educational opportunities in Clarendon County. The first step was to craft a local petition for educational equality. This was done by Rev. Joseph Armstrong DeLaine and Modjeska Monteith Simkins, the noted South Carolina civil rights worker. Simkins organized a national charitable effort for the relief of the oppressed African Americans of Clarendon County. Eventually, more than 100 Clarendon residents signed the petition.

===Additional plaintiffs===
Others agreed to join the suit of Levi Pearson. Named first in the suit, Harry Briggs, a service station attendant, and Eliza Briggs, a maid, became the main named plaintiffs. Elliott was named the defendant.

When &quot;Brown&quot; reached the U.S. Supreme Court, South Carolina was one of seventeen states that required school segregation. State law required complete segregation; Article 11, Section 7 of the 1896 Constitution of South Carolina read as follows: &quot;Separate schools shall be provided for children of the white and colored races, and no child of either race shall ever be permitted to attend a school provided for children of the other race.&quot; Section 5377 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina of 1942 read: &quot;It shall be unlawful for pupils of one race to attend the schools provided by boards of trustees for persons of another race.&quot;

There was little debate about if the Clarendon County schools were unequal. At the beginning of the hearings in U.S. District Court, the defendants shared on the record that &quot;the educational facilities, equipment, curricula and opportunities afforded in School District No. 22 for colored pupils are not substantially equal to those afforded for white pupils.&quot;
==Proceedings==
The case would ordinarily have come up before Judge Julius Waring of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina. However, Judge Waring recommended to Thurgood Marshall for the case to be expanded from an equalization case into a desegregation case. Instead of asking for enforcement of the separate but equal doctrine by bringing the African American schools up to equality with the white schools, the plaintiffs asked for school segregation to be declared unconstitutional.

===Three-judge panel===
By expanding the case, both Waring and Marshall expected the plaintiffs to lose the case 2—1 and for the case to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court. As predicted, a three-judge panel found segregation lawful by a vote of 2–1, with Judge Waring writing a dissent in which he stated that &quot;segregation is &quot;per se&quot; inequality.&quot; The other two judges were John J. Parker and George Timmerman. The panel also granted an injunction to equalize the uncontested inferiority of the schools used by African American students.

Originally litigated by NAACP lawyer Robert L. Carter, the &quot;Briggs&quot; case was notable for introducing into evidence the experiments of Kenneth and Mamie Clark, who used dolls to study children&#x27;s attitudes about race. Under tests performed by Clark, African American students in segregated schools were shown a white doll and an African American doll and asked which one they preferred. When most African American students indicated their preference for the white doll, Clark concluded that segregated schooling decreased African American self-esteem.

==Decision==
In 1952, the Supreme Court heard the case and returned it to the district court for rehearing after Clarendon County school officials had sent a report on progress in making facilities equal. Between 1951 and 1955, more than 700 &quot;equalization schools&quot; were constructed for Black students across South Carolina, utilizing modern architecture and educational innovations. Even so, the schools were underfunded, teachers were underpaid, and local white-led governments were generally unsupportive of African Americans receiving an equal education.

In March, the district court again heard the case. The Court found that progress had been made towards equality. Thurgood Marshall argued that it may be true, but the real issue was that as long as separation existed, the schools would be unequal. The case was appealed back to the Supreme Court in May. The case was then consolidated with several other school desegregation cases into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

&quot;Briggs&quot; was the first of the five &quot;Brown&quot; cases to be argued before the Supreme Court. Spottswood Robinson and Thurgood Marshall argued the case for the plaintiffs, and former Solicitor General and presidential candidate John W. Davis led the argument for the defense. Following the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, the lower court complied with the mandate issued by the Supreme Court and declared the South Carolina school segregation law to be unconstitutional.

==Aftermath==

Although &quot;Brown&quot; resulted in a legal victory against segregation, it was a costly victory for those associated with &quot;Briggs&quot;. Reverend Joseph DeLaine, the generally acknowledged leader of Summerton&#x27;s African-Americans, was fired from his post at a local school in Silver. His wife, Mattie, was also fired from her position at Scott&#x27;s Branch, as were all of the other signatories. De Laine&#x27;s church was burned, and he moved to Buffalo, New York in 1955 after he had survived an attempted drive-by shooting. Both Harry and Eliza Briggs, on behalf of whose children the suit was filed, lost their jobs. Harry spent more than a decade working in Florida to support the family. Eliza eventually joined her children in New York.

Judge Waring had already been shunned by the white community in Charleston and subjected to attacks for previous decisions favorable to equal rights. After his dissent in the three-judge panel, he retired in 1952 and moved to New York.

Eventually, the state of South Carolina awarded Eliza Briggs its highest civilian honor, the Order of the Palmetto. Reverend Joseph A. De Laine, Harry and Eliza Briggs, and Levi Pearson were awarded Congressional Gold Medals posthumously in 2003. The Briggs v. Elliot case is remembered as a pivotal moment in the struggle for racial equality and educational justice. It exposed the systemic inequalities in the American education system and paved the way for desegregation efforts in schools nationwide.

In 2024, the National Park Service announced grants to renovate and restore multiple equalization schools constructed during South Carolina&#x27;s &quot;separate but equal&quot; efforts in the 1950s. Several such schools have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Norfolk State University (NSU) is a public historically black university in Norfolk, Virginia. It is a member of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and Virginia High-Tech Partnership.

==History==

The institution was founded on September 18, 1935, as the Norfolk Unit of Virginia Union University. Eighty-five students attended the first classes held in 1935. Mr. Samuel Fischer Scott, an alumnus of Virginia Union and Portsmouth native, served as the first director with the primary focus of maintaining the solvency of the school. Dr. Lyman Beecher Brooks, a Virginia Union alumnus, succeeded Mr. Scott as director in 1938, and served as provost, 1963–1969, and the first president 1969–1975.

In 1942, the school became independent of VUU and was named Norfolk Polytechnic College. Within two years, by an act of the Virginia Legislature, it became a part of Virginia State College (now Virginia State University). By 1950, the 15th anniversary of the college founding, the faculty had grown to fifty and the student enrollment to 1,018. In 1952, the college&#x27;s athletic teams adopted the &quot;Spartan&quot; name and identity.

The City of Norfolk provided a permanent site for the college on Corprew Avenue, and in 1955 Brown Hall, formerly Tidewater Hall, opened as the first permanent building on the new campus. In 1956 the future Norfolk State College granted its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

In 1969, the college divided from Virginia State College and was named Norfolk State College. The college was issued accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools the same year with an enrollment of 5,400 students. In 1975 and the year following, the first master&#x27;s degrees were awarded in Communications and Social Work, respectively. Dr. Harrison Benjamin Wilson Jr., in 1975, succeeded Dr. Lyman Beecher Brooks as president after 37 years.

When the college was granted university status in 1979 by the General Assembly of Virginia, it changed its name to Norfolk State University.

Norfolk State University celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1985 with a year of observances and with an enrollment of 7,200. In 1995 Norfolk State University&#x27;s enrollment reached 9,112.

Upon the retirement of Dr. Harrison Benjamin Wilson in 1997, Marie Valentine McDemmond became NSU&#x27;s third President in 1997 and served until her retirement. Alvin J. Schexnider became interim president in July 2005. Carolyn Meyers was selected as the fourth President and began service on July 1, 2006. Tony Atwater was announced as the new president in 2011 becoming the fifth president and served until he was removed by the board of visitors of Norfolk State University on August 23, 2013. Sandra DeLoatch the Provost and President of Academic Affairs was named acting president effective. On September 13, 2013, Eddie N. Moore Jr. was appointed interim president of Norfolk State University and started serving in that capacity on September 23, 2013.

In December 2013, the university was placed on probation by its regional accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, for &quot;financial and governance issues.&quot; The probation was lifted two years later.

Eddie Moore Jr. became the 6th president of Norfolk State University on January 10, 2016.

Upon President Moore announcing his retirement in late September 2017 the NSU board of visitors named Dr. Melvin Stith as interim president. He assumed office on January 1, 2018. On June 24, 2019, Dr. Javaune Adams-Gaston became the 7th president of Norfolk State University after moving from her job as Senior Vice President for Student Life at Ohio State University.

In 2020, Norfolk State received $40 million from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott. Her gift is the largest single gift in Norfolk State&#x27;s history.

==Academics==
The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools has accredited Norfolk State to award associate, baccalaureate, master and doctoral degrees. Currently, Norfolk State offers three doctorate and 15 master&#x27;s degrees, including master&#x27;s degree programs in electronic engineering, computer science, and criminal justice. The school also offers 36 undergraduate degrees, including the only undergraduate degree in optical engineering in Virginia.

===Schools===
Norfolk State&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate programs are divided into eight schools/colleges.
* School of Business
* School of Education
** By 2004, NSU had a fast-track program for special education licensing.
* College of Liberal Arts
* College of Engineering, Science &amp; Technology
* School of Social Work
* School of Extended Learning
* Honors College
* Graduate School

==Campus==

Located on the former site of the Memorial Park Golf Course, which the city of Norfolk sold to the school for one dollar, the campus now encompasses of land and 31 buildings.


The Joseph G. Echols Memorial Hall is a large health, physical education, and ROTC complex with a seating capacity of 7,500. Other facilities include a 30,000-seat football stadium; a television studio and radio station, an African art museum, and a multi-purpose performing arts center. Research facilities include a life sciences building with a planetarium and a materials research wing with crystal growth, organic synthesis, laser spectroscopy, and magnetic resonance equipment.

In September 2009, the New Student Center facility opened. The three-story building, which includes a game room, a dining area, a new bookstore, a wellness center (work-out facility), student lounges, and administrative offices, marks the first of two major projects for NSU.

In January 2015, the construction of the New Nursing and General Classroom Building was completed, and in the fall 2017 NSU opened a new G.W.C. Brown Memorial Hall, a three-story, 154,000-square-foot academic building, which houses the School of Business, College of Liberal Arts, and Mass Communication and Math Department. The building also houses the box office, costume shop, scene shop, mainstage theater, studio theater, amphitheater, as well as drama faculty offices, classrooms, meeting rooms, study areas, and student lounges. Construction of a new four-story residential facility began in 2019. Once completed, the 193,424-square-foot residential facility will include a central two-story amenity space and 740 beds for first-year students.

Construction plans for a new science building and physical plant are underway. Other recent construction on the campus include the new police station (2007), the Marie V. McDemmond Center for Applied Research (2006), and the Spartan Suites Apartments (2001), and state-of-the-art library (2012).

==Student activities==

The university offers organized and informal co-curricular activities including 63 student organizations, leadership workshops, intramural activities, student publications and student internships.

===Athletics===
Norfolk State sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (Football Championship Subdivision for all sports including football) in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC). Norfolk State was formerly a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference (1953–1960) and the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (1962–1996).

The 2011–12 Norfolk State Spartans men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2012 MEAC men&#x27;s basketball tournament championship which gave them the conference&#x27;s automatic bid in the 2012 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament, the school&#x27;s first ever appearance in the tournament. The Spartans, a 15 seed, defeated the #2 seeded Missouri Tigers in the second round, 86–84.

<text>el-Djerid, also al-Jarīd, (; Derja: &quot;Jrīd&quot;; ) or more precisely the South Western Tunisia Region is a semi-desert natural region comprising three southern Tunisian Governorates, Gafsa, Kebili and Tozeur with adjacent parts of Algeria and Libya.

==Geography==
The region is characterised by bare pink hills with oases and several chotts (salt pans) such as Chott el Djerid in Tunisia. Economically the area is important for phosphate mining. Major towns include Gafsa and Tozeur.

It remains the principal center of Ibāḍism in North Africa, with remaining Ibāḍī communities on Djerba in Tunisia, in the M&#x27;zab in Algeria, and in Jabal Nafusa in Libya. In medieval times, it often formed a politically separate entity under the control of Ibāḍī &quot;imams&quot;.

==Location==
Jerid, Djerid&quot; or &quot;Bled el Djerid (Arabic : الجريد, literally &quot;palm leaf&quot;), is a semi-desert region situated in southwestern Tunisia, which extends to the contiguous areas of Algeria.

In administrative terms, it is associated in Tunisia with the province (governorate) of Tozeur and, at least in part and according to some sources, also the province of Gafsa and Kebili. The latter is part of the Nefzaoua region, which is sometimes considered part of Jerid.

The region is dotted with oases scattered between two chotts (largely dry salt lakes most of the time). Among the chotts stands out Chott el Jerid. In economic terms, the region stands out for its production of dates, namely the superior &quot;deglet nour&quot; variety, and since the 1990s tourism has gained importance. There is also the mining of phosphate deposits, mainly in the north of the region (Gafsa).

==History==

The Jerid was already inhabited by the Numidians before the arrival of the Romans in the 3rd century BC. Then came the Romans, who erected fortifications, integrated in the limes of the southern border of the province of Proconsular Africa, whose purpose was to prevent the incursions of the nomadic populations of the Sahara.
With the arrival of Christianity, the region hosted two episcopal sees, one in Thusurus (Tozeur) and one in Nepte (Nefta). After a fleeting passage of the Vandals in the 5th century AD, the rule of the Byzantines continued until the invasion of the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Empire in the 7th century, who occupied all of Tunisia and Arabized and Islamized. During the Middle Ages, Jerid had remarkable economic progress, mainly due to the strategic position in the caravan routes that connected the Mediterranean Basin to sub-Saharan Africa. Until the 11th century, the trade routes and movement of gold were managed by Ibadi Arabs of the Djarid. Among the &quot;goods&quot; transported were numerous slaves, who were bought to work in the oases. During the Ottoman period, the region was the scene of revolts against high taxes and nomadic incursions. The relative decline of the region since that time is due in large part to the loss of the strategic and economic importance of the trans-Saharan trade.

==Population==
The population of the province of Tozeur, the central nucleus of the region, was estimated at 104,800 inhabitants in 2011, 4.5% more than in 2007 and 7.5% more than in 2004, concentrating mainly on the cities of Tozeur and Nefta. In the same year it was estimated that Gafsa province to the north would have 341,600 inhabitants, 3.5% more than in 2007 and 5.5% more than in 2004. The estimate for the province of Kebili in the south, Which many authors do not include in the region, was then of 152 200 inhabitants, 3.9% more than in 2007 and 6.3% more than in 2004.

In ethnic terms, the population results from the intermarriage of native Berbers, Arabs, and slaves from sub-Saharan Africa.

==Economy==
Jerid has about 1.6 million date palms and is one of Tunisia&#x27;s most important date-producing regions, especially the most valuable variety, &quot;deglet nour&quot;. 
Considering the wider version of Jerid, about 85% of Tunisia&#x27;s total production of dates comes from the region, which in 2010-2011 produced almost 150,000 tonnes. In the same year, only 0.2% of the deglet nour variety was produced outside the region. Whereas the province of Kebili is not part of Jerid, the percentages fall to about 30% of the total and also 30% of deglet nour, which corresponds respectively to 52,125 and 36,050 tonnes.
Despite extreme weather conditions - maximum temperatures are close to 50 °C and annual precipitations are very limited (between 80 and 120 mm) - the Jerid oases are very productive due to their resources in waters currently extracted from very deep underground aquifers through modern bore holes.

<text>Shpola (, ) is a city located in Zvenyhorodka Raion of Cherkasy Oblast (province) in central Ukraine. In May 2011, a 14-meter monument was installed on the outskirts of the city, claiming that Shpola is the geographical center of Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Shpola urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. It had a population of 

==Administrative status==
In 1797, Shpola became part of the Zvenigorod district in the Kiev Governorate. It has been a city since 1938. Until 18 July, 2020, Shpola served as an administrative center of Shpola Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Cherkasy Oblast to four. The area of Shpola Raion was merged into Zvenyhorodka Raion.

== History ==
After the revolution of 1917, Shpola became first a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and then of the USSR.

During World War II, Nazi Germany invaded USSR, and the Jewish population of Shpola was massacred in 1942. Today Jews make up around 0.5% of Shpola&#x27;s population.

== Demographics ==
In 1847, Shpola&#x27;s Jewish population numbered 1,156. By 1897, that number had grown to 5,388 of a total population of 11,933, or about 45%. This level held steady until the Second World War. In 1989, the population of the city was 22, 378 people.

== Sister city ==
Shpola is a sister city with Oskaloosa, Iowa.

== Notable people ==
* Ivan Kulyk (1897-1937) - Ukrainian poet, short stories writer, and diplomat;
* Lev Shvartzman (1907-1955) -- a senior Soviet secret police officer, known for his brutality;
* Oleksandr Tkachenko - chairman of Ukrainian parliament;

<doc id="635670" wikidata="Q4379714" url="?curid=635670" title="Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County">
<text>Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County (Docket number: Civ. A. No. 1333; Case citation: 103 F. Supp. 337 (1952)) was one of the five cases combined into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the famous case in which the U.S. Supreme Court, in 1954, officially overturned racial segregation in U.S. public schools. The Davis case was the only such case to be initiated by a student protest. The case challenged segregation in Prince Edward County, Virginia.

==Background==
R.R. Moton High School, an all-black high school in Farmville, Virginia, founded in 1923, suffered from terrible conditions due to underfunding. The school did not have a gymnasium, cafeteria or teachers&#x27; restrooms. Teachers and students did not have desks or blackboards, and due to overcrowding, some students had to take classes in an immobilized, decrepit school bus parked outside the main school building. The school&#x27;s requests for additional funds were denied by the all-white school board.

In response, on April 23, 1951, a 16-year-old student named Barbara Rose Johns, who was the niece of Vernon Johns, the famous black Baptist preacher and civil rights leader, covertly organized a student general strike. She forged notes to teachers telling them to bring their students to the auditorium for a special announcement. When the school&#x27;s students showed up, Johns took the stage and persuaded the school to strike to protest poor school conditions. Over 450 walked out and marched to the homes of members of the school board, who refused to see them and instead threatened them with expulsions. This led to a two-week protest from students.

Further details about this story can be found in Taylor Branch&#x27;s &quot;Parting The Waters, America In The King Years 1954-63&quot;, published by Simon and Schuster in 1988. This book mentions that the headmaster was told over the phone that the police were about to arrest two of his students at the bus station. He failed to recognize this call as a ruse, so he went to town. Only thereafter were notes calling to a special assembly delivered to the classroom. When the headmaster returned, he tried to talk the students out of striking, but they refused.

This book also gives a different account of the teaching conditions. It states that some classes were held in &quot;three temporary tar-paper shacks&quot; built to house the overflow at the school. It was so cold during the winter that teachers and students had to keep their coats on. No classes held in a school bus are mentioned, although the school&#x27;s bus is said to be hand-me-down from the white school, and was driven by the history teacher.

==Trials==
On May 23, 1951, two lawyers from the NAACP, Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill, filed suit on behalf of 117 students against the school district to integrate the schools. The district was represented by T. Justin Moore, Archibald G. (&quot;Archie&quot;) Robertson and John W. Riely of Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell &amp; Gibson (now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth), a large Richmond law firm. J. Lindsay Almond, as Attorney General, represented the Commonwealth of Virginia. The first plaintiff listed was Dorothy E. Davis, a 14-year old ninth grader. The case was titled &quot;Dorothy E. Davis, et al.&quot; &quot;versus&quot; &quot;County School Board of Prince Edward County, Virginia&quot;.

The students&#x27; request was unanimously rejected by a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court. &quot;We have found no hurt or harm to either race,&quot; the court ruled. The case was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and consolidated with four other cases from other districts around the country into the famous &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case. In it, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public education was, effectively, unconstitutional and illegal.

==Aftermath==

The ruling was extremely unpopular among white Virginians and a considerable number of them attempted to resist integration through every means possible, during a period known as Massive Resistance. Schools remained segregated for several years. By 1959, J. Lindsay Almond had become Governor of Virginia, and faced with continuing losses in the courts, he dismantled the system of segregated schools in that state. Nevertheless, the Board of Supervisors for Prince Edward County refused to appropriate any funds for the County School Board at all, effectively closing all public schools rather than integrate them. White students often attended &quot;segregation academies&quot;, which were all-white private schools that were formed. Black students had to go to school elsewhere or forgo their education altogether. Prince Edward County schools remained closed for five years, from 1959 to 1964.

In 2008, the case and the protest which led to it were memorialized on the grounds of the Virginia State Capitol in the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial.

<doc id="635678" wikidata="Q5529577" url="?curid=635678" title="Gebhart v. Belton">
<text>Gebhart v. Belton, 33 Del. Ch. 144, 87 A.2d 862 (Del. Ch. 1952), &quot;aff&#x27;d&quot;, 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952), was a case decided by the Delaware Court of Chancery in 1952 and affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court in the same year. &quot;Gebhart&quot; was one of the five cases combined into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the 1954 decision of the United States Supreme Court which found unconstitutional racial segregation in United States public schools.

&quot;Gebhart&quot; is unique among the five &quot;Brown&quot; cases in that the state trial court ordered that black children be admitted to the state&#x27;s segregated whites-only schools, and the state Supreme Court affirmed the trial court&#x27;s decision. In the remaining &quot;Brown&quot; cases, all of which were filed in federal rather than state court, federal district courts all found continued segregation constitutional, though some judges questioned its effects on black students, and instead ordered some lesser remedy.

==Background==
The unusual status of &quot;Gebhart&quot; arose in large part because of Delaware&#x27;s unique legal and historical position. At the time of the litigation, Delaware was one of 17 states with a segregated school system. Delaware is considered a Southern state by the US Census Bureau yet was a border state that remained part of the Union during the Civil War. It nonetheless was both &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; segregated; Jim Crow laws persisted in the state well into the 1960s, and its educational system was segregated by operation of law. In fact, Delaware&#x27;s segregation was written into the state constitution, which, while providing at Article X, Section 2, that &quot;no distinction shall be made on account of race or color&quot;, nonetheless required that &quot;separate schools for white and colored children shall be maintained.&quot; Furthermore, a 1935 state education law required:

The schools provided shall be of two kinds; those for white children and those for colored children. The schools for white children shall be free for all white children between the ages of six and twenty-one years, inclusive; and the schools for colored children shall be free to all colored children between the ages of six and twenty-one years, inclusive. ... The State Board of Education shall establish schools for children of people called Moors or Indians.

Despite this optimistic language, black schools in Delaware were generally decrepit, with poor facilities, substandard curricula, and shoddy construction. Without substantial financial support provided by Wilmington&#x27;s Du Pont family of chemical fame, segregated schools would likely have been in even worse shape.

At the same time, as a remnant of its days as one of the original thirteen former British colonies, Delaware had developed a judicial system which included a separate Court of Chancery, hearing matters arising in equity rather than in law. As opposed to legal remedies, which usually involve awarding money as damages, equity— as expressed in the maxims of equity, &quot;regards as done that which ought to be done.&quot; As a result, cases brought in equity generally seek relief which cannot be awarded as a sum of money, but rather &quot;that which ought to be done&quot;.

==The disputes ==
&quot;Gebhart&quot; involved two separate actions which were consolidated for the purposes of trial.

=== &quot;Belton v. Gebhart&quot; ===
&quot;Belton v. Gebhart&quot; was brought by Ethel Louise Belton and six other parents of eight black high school students who lived in Claymont, Delaware. Despite the existence of a well-maintained, spacious high school in Claymont, segregation forced the parents to send their children on a public bus to attend the run-down Howard High School in downtown Wilmington. Howard High School was Delaware&#x27;s sole business and college-preparatory school for black students and served the entire state of Delaware. Related concerns involved class size, teacher qualifications, and curriculum; indeed, Howard students interested in vocational training were required to walk several blocks to a nearby annex to attend classes offered only after the conclusion of the normal school day.

=== &quot;Bulah v. Gebhart&quot; ===
&quot;Bulah v. Gebhart&quot; was brought by Sarah Bulah, a resident of the rural town of Hockessin, Delaware. Mrs. Bulah&#x27;s daughter, Shirley, had been denied admission to the modern, whites-only Hockessin School No. 29, and instead was compelled to attend a one-room &quot;colored&quot; school, Hockessin School No. 107, which, though very near School No. 29, had vastly inferior facilities and construction. Moreover, Shirley Bulah was required to walk to school every day, even though a school bus serving the nearby whites-only school passed by her house every day. Mrs. Bulah had attempted to obtain transportation for Shirley on that bus, but she was told they would never transport a black student.

== The trial ==
&quot;Gebhart&quot; was filed in 1951 in the Delaware Court of Chancery by lawyers Jack Greenberg and Louis L. Redding under a strategy formulated by Robert L. Carter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

Redding was the first black attorney in the history of Delaware and had developed a notable civil-rights practice in his years before the bar. Frequently, he would be sought out by families unable to afford his services, offering his assistance anyway. Over the years, Redding had developed a reputation as a skilled advocate for racial equality, most notably in &quot;Parker v. University of Delaware&quot;, 75 A.2d 225 (Del. Ch. 1950), which resulted in a ruling from the Court of Chancery that segregation at the University of Delaware was unconstitutional. The prospect of Southern-style segregation being adjudicated by a court of equity which had previously expressed an opinion prohibiting racial segregation was clearly attractive to Greenberg and Redding.

Presiding over the &quot;Gebhart&quot; trial was Chancellor Collins J. Seitz, who had issued the &quot;Parker&quot; opinion the prior year. In 1946, at the age of 35, Seitz had been appointed to the Court of Chancery, making him the youngest judge in the history of Delaware. Just prior to the &quot;Gebhart&quot; litigation, Seitz had given a graduation speech at a local Catholic boys&#x27; high school, in which he discussed the courage that would be required to address &quot;a subject that was one of Delaware&#x27;s great taboos -- the subjugated state of its Negroes. How can we say that we deeply revere the principles of our Declaration [of Independence] and our Constitution and yet refuse to recognize these principles when they are applied to the American Negro in a down-to-earth fashion?&quot;

The plaintiffs presented evidence throughout the course of the trial demonstrating the patently inferior conditions of the Wilmington and Hockessin schools, consisting of testimony and documentary evidence of the schools&#x27; infrastructures. In addition, the plaintiffs offered expert testimony from psychologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists, and sociologists—none of which was rebutted by the defense—demonstrating that the inadequate educational facilities and curricula found in segregated schools were harmful to the mental health of black children.

Dramatically illustrating the disparate conditions in the schools were fire insurance valuations prepared by the State of Delaware in 1941, which featured photographs of all Delaware public schools as well as their assessed value. For example, the &quot;colored&quot; school in Hockessin was valued at only $6,250.00, while the whites-only Hockessin school was valued almost seven times higher. The most powerful evidence, however, probably came from the plaintiffs themselves, who described the conditions in their segregated schools and the hardship they were forced to endure to attend those schools in lieu of the much nicer, and more convenient, whites-only schools.

In summary, the plaintiffs argued that:
* Segregated schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, in that they did not offer black children equal protection of the law; but, if not, then:
* The separate facilities and educational opportunities offered to black children were not equal to those furnished to white children similarly situated.

== The decision ==
Initially, Chancellor Seitz noted that the separate but equal law had already been adopted by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; and that he did not feel able, as a judge of an inferior court, to &quot;reject a principle of United States constitutional law which has been adopted by fair implication by the highest court of the land.&quot; For this reason, the Court refused to find that the segregated schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment, but not by any means on the merits of the system; as the Court observed, &quot;I believe the &#x27;separate but equal&#x27; doctrine in education should be rejected, but I also believe its rejection must come from [the U.S. Supreme] [C]ourt.&quot;

That, however, did not end the Court&#x27;s analysis. The Court found that the separate &quot;colored&quot; facilities were in no way equal to the whites-only facilities, and, exercising the broad powers of a court of equity, ordered that black students be immediately integrated.

Chancellor Seitz decried the unequal conditions of the plaintiffs&#x27; schools in strong terms:

I now consider whether the facilities of the [Claymont and Howard] institutions are separate but equal, within the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Are the separate facilities and educational opportunities offered to these Negro plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, &quot;equal&quot; in the constitutional sense, to those available at Claymont High to white children, similarly situated? The answer to this question is often much more difficult than appears, because many of the factors to be compared are just not susceptible of mathematical evaluation, e. g., aesthetic considerations. Moreover, and of real importance, the United States Supreme Court has not decided what should be done if a Negro school being compared with a white school is inferior in some respects and superior in others. It is easy, as some courts do, to talk about the necessity for finding substantial equality. But, under this approach, how is one to deal with a situation where, as here, the mental and physical health services at the Negro school are superior to those offered at the white school while the teacher load at the Negro school is not only substantially heavier than that at the white school, but often exceeds the State announced educationally desirable maximum teacher-pupil ratio. The answer, it seems to me is this: Where the facilities or educational opportunities available to the Negro are, as to any substantial factor, inferior to those available to white children similarly situated, the constitutional principle of &quot;separate but equal&quot; is violated, even though the State may point to other factors as to which the Negro school is superior. I reach this conclusion because I do not believe a court can say that the substantial factor as to which the Negro school is inferior will not adversely affect the educational progress of at least some of those concerned. Moreover, evaluating unlike factors is unrealistic. If this be a harsh test, then I answer that a State which divides its citizens should pay the price.

With regard to the Hockessin schools at issue in &quot;Bulah&quot;, the Court noted similar disparities demonstrating a lack of equal treatment:

Another factor connected with these two schools demands separate attention, because it is a consequence of segregation so outlandish that the Attorney General, with commendable candor, has in effect refused to defend it. I refer to the fact that school bus transportation is provided those attending No. 29 who, except for color, are in the same situation as this infant plaintiff. Yet neither school bus transportation, nor its equivalent is provided this plaintiff even to attend No. 107. In fact, the State Board of Education refused to authorize the transportation of this then seven-year-old plaintiff to the Negro school, even though the bus for white children went right past her home, and even though the two schools are no more than a mile apart. Moreover, there is no public transportation available from or near plaintiff&#x27;s home to or near the Negro school. The State Board ruled that because of the State constitutional provision for separate schools, a Negro child may not ride in a bus serving a white school. If we assume that this is so, then this practice in and of itself, is another reason why the facilities offered this plaintiff at No. 107 are inferior to those provided at No. 29. To suggest, under the facts here presented, that there are not enough Negroes to warrant the cost of a school bus for them is only another way of saying that they are not entitled to equal services because they are Negroes. Such an excuse will not do here.

I conclude that the facilities and educational opportunities at No. 107 are substantially inferior in a constitutional sense, to those at No. 29. For the reasons stated in connection with Claymont I do not believe the relief should merely be an order to make equal. An injunction will issue preventing the defendants and their agents from refusing these plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, admission to School No. 29 because of their color.

On August 28, 1952, the Supreme Court of Delaware unanimously affirmed the Chancery Court&#x27;s ruling. Despite this, the two schools of Hockessin Elementary and Claymont High School did not integrate in 1952 because the State Board of Education did not give these schools an official mandate to do so. The Claymont High Board of Education met on September 3, 1952, and decided they would enroll the black students even without a mandate. At the last minute the State Board of Education called and gave a verbal mandate for the children to attend. On the morning of September 4, 1952, eleven black students got on their bus and came to Claymont High School and there were no incidents. The next day, Delaware Attorney Young called and told Claymont Superintendent Stahl to &quot;send the children home&quot; because the cases were being appealed and eventually became part of the &quot;Brown v. Board&quot; case. Superintendent Stahl and the School Board refused to send the children home, because they wanted the school to be integrated and had worked hard to have integration occur through the court systems. Even the high school teachers signed a letter stating that they wanted the students to remain. Claymont administrators were willing to defy the state. After many meetings, the State School Board agreed to allow the students remain in Claymont, Hockessin and Arden. Arden had an elementary school which fed into the Claymont High School. Recently moved into Ardencroft was a family that had three students which were now attending Claymont High School and three children that were elementary school aged. Arden had voted to allow these younger children to attend their school. The State Board of Education decided to allow these children to remain in Arden.

The State Board of Education declared that no other public schools in Delaware were permitted to integrate until after the &quot;Brown v. Board&quot; decision was decided.

== The aftermath ==
The State Attorney General appealed Chancellor Seitz&#x27; decision in &quot;Gebhart&quot; to the Delaware Supreme Court. The plaintiffs, believing the Court of Chancery had not gone far enough in overturning the concept of &quot;separate but equal&quot;, cross-appealed. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision in a relatively short opinion, relying on &quot;Plessy&quot; to reject arguments that segregation &quot;per se&quot; was unconstitutional, while ordering integration and leaving open the possibility of resegregation in the future. From there, the school-district defendants appealed to the United States Supreme Court, where the consolidation with &quot;Brown&quot; occurred.
The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown&quot; affirmed the Supreme Court of Delaware&#x27;s order to allow black students to enrolled in previously all-white schools. This was the only case the Supreme Court affirmed in part. The Supreme Court then reversed the Delaware Supreme Court on the constitutional issues and remanded the cases for further proceedings. After the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling, a sea change occurred in American and Delaware politics and society. The result of this ruling was that Delaware became fully integrated, albeit with time and much effort. The state Department of Public Instruction agreed to integrate all Delaware schools in light of the Supreme Court&#x27;s order. In Northern and Central Delaware, most were willing to accept the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling, but there was much opposition from white residents in the southern portion of the state.

The white supremacist Bryant Bowles raised $6,000 and founded the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP) to oppose the ruling. Bowles briefly attracted nationwide attention for leading a pro-segregation boycott of previously all-white Milford High School. On September 27, 1954, as eleven black students were preparing to enroll at the school, unrest from angry townspeople was feared to be imminent. In response, Louis Redding issued an urgent telegram to Delaware Governor J. Caleb Boggs requesting the presence of state police officers &quot;adequate to assure personal safety of eleven children whose admittance to that school last night was confirmed by state board of education.&quot; Redding closed his telegram with an optimistic line: &quot;Hope also no occasion for powers of the police will arise.&quot; A mass meeting in Milford held in October of that year attracted a crowd of 3,000 people. Bowles encouraged a boycott to protest the integration of Delaware schools. Only 456 out of 1562 Milford High School students attended the next day, and the movement gained traction in the nearby town of Lincoln, where 116 of the 146 pupils in the local elementary school boycotted in solidarity. Mass protests continued in Milford; the school board eventually ceded to the protestors, expelling the black students. Several weeks later, Bowles was arrested for &quot;conspiring to violate the state education law by leading a boycott at Milford’s integrated high school&quot;. The Attorney General later took action to revoke the NAAWP&#x27;s corporate charter in September 1955. However, the ensuing unrest, which included cross burnings, rallies, and pro-segregation demonstrations, contributed to desegregation in most of Southern Delaware being delayed for another ten years. School segregation in the state would not end until 1967.

Some argue that while the state of race relations was dramatically improving post-&quot;Brown&quot;, any progress was destroyed in the wake of the rioting that broke out in Wilmington in April 1968 in the wake of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. Delaware&#x27;s response to the Wilmington riots was heavy-handed in the opinion of some, involving the virtual occupation of the city for over one year by the Delaware National Guard.

For his efforts in defeating segregation, Louis Redding was honored with a life-size bronze statue of him embracing a young black schoolboy and a young white schoolgirl outside the City-County government complex in downtown Wilmington, which is also named for him. Redding was also honored by the naming of Louis Redding Middle School in Middletown, New Castle County.

<text>A lease is a contractual arrangement calling for the user (referred to as the &quot;lessee&quot;) to pay the owner (referred to as the &quot;lessor&quot;) for the use of an asset. Property, buildings and vehicles are common assets that are leased. Industrial or business equipment are also leased. In essence, a lease agreement is a contract between two parties: the lessor and the lessee. The lessor is the legal owner of the asset, while the lessee obtains the right to use the asset in return for regular rental payments. The lessee also agrees to abide by various conditions regarding their use of the property or equipment. For example, a person leasing a car may agree to the condition that the car will only be used for personal use.

The term rental agreement can refer to two kinds of leases:

* A lease in which the asset is tangible property. Here, the user &quot;rents&quot; the asset (e.g. land or goods) &quot;let out&quot; or &quot;rented out&quot; by the owner (the verb &quot;to lease&quot; is less precise because it can refer to either of these actions). Examples of a lease for intangible property include use of a computer program (similar to a license, but with different provisions), or use of a radio frequency (such as a contract with a cell-phone provider).
* A periodic lease agreement (most often a month-to-month lease) internationally and in some regions of the United States.

== General terms ==
A lease is a legal contract, and thus enforceable by all parties under the contract law of the applicable jurisdiction.

In the United States, since it also represents a conveyance of possessory rights to real estate, it is a hybrid sort of contract that involves qualities of a deed.

Some kinds of leases may have specific clauses required by statute depending upon the property being leased, the jurisdiction in which the agreement was signed, and the residence of the parties.

Common elements of a lease agreement include:
* Names of the parties of the agreement.
* The starting date and duration of the agreement.
* Identifies the specific object (by street address, VIN, or make/model, serial number) being leased.
* Provides conditions for renewal or non-renewal.
* Has a specific consideration (a lump sum, or periodic payments) for granting the use of this object.
* Has provisions for a security deposit and terms for its return.
* May have a specific list of conditions which are therein described as Default Conditions and specific Remedies.
* May have other specific conditions placed upon the parties such as:
** Need to provide insurance for loss.
** Restrictive use.
** Which party is responsible for maintenance.
* Termination clause (describing what will happen if the contract is ended early or cancelled by either of the parties, stating the rights of parties to terminate the lease, and their obligations)

All kinds of personal property (e.g. cars and furniture) or real property (e.g. raw land, apartments, single family homes, and business property, which includes wholesale and retail) may be leased. As a result of the lease, the owner (lessor) grants the use of the stated property to the lessee.

== Leases of land ==
The narrower term &#x27;tenancy&#x27; describes a lease in which the tangible property is land (including at any vertical section such as airspace, storey of building or mine). A premium is an amount paid by the tenant for the lease to be granted or to secure the former tenant&#x27;s lease, often in order to secure a low rent, in long leases termed a &quot;ground rent&quot;. For parts of buildings it is most common for users to pay also by collateral contract, or by the same contract, a service charge which is normally an express list of services in a lease to minimize disputes over service charges. A gross lease or tenancy stipulates a rent that is for the global amount due including all service charges.

A cancelable lease (UK: determinable/breakable lease) is a lease that may be terminated (formally &quot;determined&quot;) solely by the lessee or solely by the lessor without penalty. A mutually determinable lease can be determined by either. A non-cancelable lease is a lease that cannot be so terminated. Commonly, &quot;lease&quot; may imply a non-cancelable lease, whereas &quot;rental agreement&quot; may connote a cancelable lease.

Influenced by land registration, commonly tenancies initially granted for more than a year are referred to more simply as leases.

The lease will either provide specific provisions regarding the responsibilities and rights of the lessee and lessor, or there will be automatic provisions as a result of local law. In general, by paying the negotiated fee to the lessor, the lessee (also called a tenant) has possession and use (the rental) of the leased property to the exclusion of the lessor and all others except with the invitation of the tenant. The most common form of real property lease is a residential rental agreement between landlord and tenant. As the relationship between the tenant and the landlord is called a tenancy, this term generally is also used for informal and shorter leases. The right to possession by the tenant is sometimes called a leasehold interest. A lease can be for a fixed period of time (called the term of the lease).
A lease may be terminated sooner than its end date by:
* Break/cancellation (this depends upon the terms of the lease)
* A negotiated deed of surrender or yielding-up.
* Forfeiture
* By operation of statute (rare)

A lease should be contrasted with a license, which may entitle a person (called a licensee) to use property, but which is subject to termination at the will of the owner of the property (called the licensor). An example of a licensor/licensee relationship is a parking lot owner and a person who parks a vehicle in the parking lot. A license may be seen in the form of a ticket to a baseball game or a verbal permission to sleep a few days on a sofa. The difference is that if there is a term (end time), a degree of privacy suggestive of exclusive possession of a clearly defined part, practised ongoing, recurrent payments, a lack of right to terminate save for misconduct or nonpayment, these factors tend toward a lease; by contrast, a one-time entrance onto someone else&#x27;s property is probably a license. The seminal difference between a lease and a license is that a lease generally provides for regular periodic payments during its term and a specific ending date. If a contract has no ending date then it may be in the form of a &quot;perpetual license&quot; and still not be a lease.

Under normal circumstances, owners of property are at liberty to do what they want with their property (for a lawful purpose), including dealing with it or handing over possession of the property to a tenant for a limited period of time. If an owner has granted possession to another (i.e., the tenant) then any interference with the quiet enjoyment of the property by the tenant in lawful possession is itself unlawful.

Similar principles apply to real property as well as to personal property, though the terminology differs. The right to sub-lease may or may not be permitted to a tenant. Where it is permitted, the lease granted directly by the owner is called a &quot;headlease&quot;, or sometimes a &quot;master lease&quot;. Headlease tenants and their tenants who may in turn also sublet are termed &quot;mesne landlords&quot; from the old French for middle. The headlease tenant has no right to grant a sublease which extends beyond the end of the headlease.

To circumvent privity of estate which is the general principle flowing from privity of contract, laws exist in several jurisdictions to bind subtenants to some of the restrictive covenants (terms) of the headlease, for instance in England and Wales those which have been held by courts to touch and concern the land.

A transfer of a remaining interest in a lease, assignment, is a type of (&quot;alienation&quot;) is often possible and an implied rights to assign exist by compulsory law or as a default position in some jurisdictions. Sharing or parting with possession can be a breach of certain leases resulting in action for forfeiture.

Enfranchisement is the obtaining of the landlord&#x27;s title and is most commonly negotiated with the landlord where a tenant pays only a &quot;ground rent&quot;. Merger is where the landlord and tenant happen to be the same and can terminate a lease where there are no subtenants in certain jurisdictions.

In the United States a lessee may negotiate a right of first refusal clause into their land or property lease giving them the right to make a purchase offer on the property before the lessor can negotiate with third-party buyers. This gives tenants the ability to commit to a piece of property before any other potential buyers have the opportunity.

== History of leases of land ==
Over the centuries, leases have served many purposes and the nature of legal regulation has varied according to those purposes and the social and economic conditions of the times. Leases, for example, were mainly used for agricultural purposes until the late 18th century and early 19th century when the growth of cities in industrialized countries made leases an important form of landholding in urban areas.

The modern law of landlord and tenant in common law jurisdictions retains the influence of the common law and, particularly, the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; philosophy that dominated the law of contract and property law in the 19th century. With the growth of consumerism, consumer protection legislation recognized that common law principles, which assume equal bargaining power between the contracting parties, create hardships when that assumption is inaccurate. Consequently, reformers have emphasized the need to assess residential tenancy laws in terms of protection they provide to tenants. Legislation to protect tenants is now common.
Consequently, Common law has treated Lease as not similar or equivalent to a common commercial contract, especially in regard to the question of whether a Lease Agreement can be terminated by notice, in the same way and manner as a usual commercial contract.

== Types of tenancies ==

=== Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years ===
A fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years lasts for some fixed period of time. It has a definite beginning date and a definite ending date. Despite the name &quot;tenancy for years&quot;, such a tenancy can last for any period of time—even a tenancy for one week may be called a tenancy for years. At common law the duration did not need to be certain, but could be conditioned upon the happening of some event, (e.g., &quot;until the crops are ready for harvest&quot; or &quot;until the war is over&quot;). In many jurisdictions that possibility has been partially or totally abolished.

A fixed term tenancy comes to an end automatically when the fixed term runs out or, in the case of a tenancy that ends on the happening of an event, when the event occurs. If a holdover tenant remains on the property after the termination of the lease, s/he may become a tenant at sufferance because the lessor/landlord has suffered (or allowed) the tenant to remain as a tenant instead of evicting him or her. Such a tenancy is generally &quot;at will,&quot; meaning the tenant or the landlord may terminate it at any time, upon the providing of proper statutory notice.

=== Periodic tenancy ===

A periodic tenancy, also known as a tenancy from year to year, month to month, or week to week, is an estate that exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent. An oral lease for a tenancy of years that violates the Statute of Frauds (by committing to a lease of more than one year—depending on the jurisdiction—without being in writing) may actually create a periodic tenancy, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the &quot;default&quot; tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is a month-to-month tenancy.

Either the landlord or the tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy when the period or term is nearing completion, by giving notice to the other party as required by statute or case law in the jurisdiction. Neither landlord nor tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy before the period has ended, without incurring an obligation to pay for the months remaining on the lease. Either party must give notice if it intends to terminate a tenancy from year to year, and the amount of notice is either specified by the lease or by state statute. Notice is usually, but not always, at least one month, especially for the year-to-year periodic tenancy. Durations of less than a year must typically receive notice equal to the period of the tenancy—for example, the landlord must give a month&#x27;s notice to terminate a tenancy from month to month. However, many jurisdictions have increased these required notice periods, and some have reduced the capacity of a landlord to use them drastically. For jurisdictions that have local rent control laws, a landlord&#x27;s ability to terminate a residential tenancy is substantially reduced. For example, in California, the cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, San Francisco, and Oakland have &quot;rent stabilization ordinances&quot; that limit a landlord&#x27;s ability to terminate a periodic tenancy, among other restrictions.

The notice must also state the effective date of termination, which, in some jurisdictions, &quot;must&quot; be on the &quot;last day&quot; of the payment period. In other words, if a month-to-month tenancy began on the 15th of the month, in a jurisdiction with a &quot;last day&quot; requirement the termination could not be effective on the 20th of the following month, even though this would give the tenant more than the required one month&#x27;s notice.

=== Tenancy at will ===
A &quot;tenancy at will&quot; is a tenancy which either the landlord or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn&#x27;t associated with a time period. It may last for many years, but it could be ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state&#x27;s statutes. If there is no formal lease, the tenancy at will is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, a tenancy at will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to &quot;at will&quot; tenancy subject to 30 days&#x27; notice. Alternatively, a tenancy at will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy at will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.

If a lease exists at the sole discretion of the landlord, the law of the jurisdiction may imply that the tenant is granted, by operation of law, a reciprocal right to terminate the lease at will. However, a lease that explicitly exists at the will of the tenant (e.g. &quot;for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land&quot;) generally does not imply that the landlord may terminate the lease; rather, such language may be interpreted as granting the tenant a life estate or even a fee simple.

A tenancy at will is broken, again by operation of law, if the:
* Tenant commits waste against the property;
* Tenant attempts to assign the tenancy;
* Tenant uses the property to operate a criminal enterprise;
* Landlord transfers his/her interest in the property;
* Landlord leases the property to another person;
* Tenant or landlord dies.

The specifics of these rules differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Subject to any notice required by law, a tenancy at will also comes to an end when either the landlord or the tenant acts inconsistently with a tenancy. For example, the changing of locks by the landlord is an indication of the end of the tenancy, as is the vacation of the premises by the tenant. However, in some jurisdictions, such as California, a landlord is prohibited from using a &quot;self help&quot; remedy, such as changing the locks, to terminate a tenancy, particularly a residential tenancy. Doing so may constitute a &quot;constructive eviction&quot; and expose the landlord to civil and criminal liability.

=== Tenancy at sufferance ===
A &quot;tenancy at sufferance&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;holdover tenancy&quot;) exists when a tenant remains in possession of a property after the expiration of a lease, and until the landlord acts to eject the tenant from the property. Although the tenant is technically a trespasser at this point, and possession of this type is not a true estate in land, authorities recognize the condition in order to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may evict such a tenant at any time, and without notice.

The landlord may also impose a new lease on the holdover tenant. For a residential tenancy, this new tenancy is month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise it is the same period as the period before the original lease expired. In either case, the landlord can raise the rent, so long as the landlord has told the tenant of the higher rent before the expiration of the original lease.

== Formalities ==
Formal requirements for a lease are determined by the law and custom of the jurisdiction in which real property is located. In the case of personal property, it is determined by the law and custom of the jurisdiction in which the rental agreement is made.

A tenancy for a duration greater than one year must be in writing in order to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.

=== Term ===
The term of the lease may be fixed, periodic or of indefinite duration. If it is for a specified period of time, the term ends automatically when the period expires, and no notice needs to be given, in the absence of legal requirements. The term&#x27;s duration may be conditional, in which case it lasts until a specified event occurs, such as the death of a specified individual. A periodic tenancy is one which is renewed automatically, usually on a monthly or weekly basis. A tenancy at will lasts only as long as the parties wish it to, and may be terminated by either party without penalty.

It is common for a lease to be extended on a &quot;holding over&quot; basis, which normally converts the tenancy to a periodic tenancy on a month by month basis. It is also possible for a tenant, either expressly or impliedly, to give up the tenancy to the landlord. This process is known as a &quot;surrender&quot; of the lease.

There have been recent restrictions and limitations in New York City regarding lease terms. One limitation in particular stated that units can not be leased for a period of less than two weeks and any unit leased for less than 90 days may not allow guests or pets in the unit.

=== Transparency and fine print ===
As stated by the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), 2013, a lack of transparency regarding a term in a standard-form consumer contract may cause a significant imbalance in the parties&#x27; rights and obligations.

A term is considered transparent if it is:
* expressed in reasonably plain language
* legible
* presented clearly
* readily available to any party affected by the term

Terms that may not be considered transparent include terms that are hidden in fine print or schedules or phrased in complex or technical language.

=== Rent ===
Rent is a requirement of leases in some common law jurisdictions, but not in civil law jurisdictions. In England and Wales it was held in the case of &quot;Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold&quot; that rent was not a requirement for there to be a lease, however the court will more often construe a licence where no rent is paid as it is seen as evidence for no intention to create legal relations. There is no requirement for the rent to be a commercial amount; a peppercorn or rent of some nominal amount is sufficient for this requirement.

=== Exclusive possession ===
A sharing arrangement with much of a landlord&#x27;s property or, for no specific room of a building for instance, may defeat a finding of a lease, however this common requirement of a lease is interpreted differently in many jurisdictions.

== Provisions specific to car rental ==
In addition to the above, a car rental agreement may include various restrictions on the way a renter can use a car, and the condition in which it must be returned. For example, some rentals cannot be driven off-road, or out of the country, or towing a trailer, without specific permission. In New Zealand you may have to specifically endorse a promise that the car will not be driven onto Ninety-Mile Beach (because of the hazardous tides).

There will certainly be a requirement to show a driver&#x27;s license, and only those drivers appearing on the contract may be authorized to drive. It may include an option to purchase auto insurance (UK: motor insurance), if the renter does not already have a policy to cover rentals—another important consideration for multiple drivers. Some agencies may even require a bond payable if the car is not returned in order, often held in the form of a credit-card authorization—voided if the car is returned per agreement. A renter should be advised that he or she will be responsible for any tolls, parking or traffic violations incurred upon the vehicle during the rental period. There should also be advice on handling thefts, accidents, break-downs, and towing.

Further terms may include added fees for late returns, drop-off at a different location, or failure to top up the petrol immediately before the return.

Finally, there may be provisions for making a non-refundable deposit with a booking, terms for payment of the initial period (with discounts, vouchers, etc.), extended periods, and any damages or other fees that accrue prior to the return.

== Leasing property ==
A rental agreement is often called a lease, especially when real estate is rented. Real estate rentals are initiated by a rental application which is used to build the terms of the lease. In addition to the basics of a rental (who, what, when, how much), a real estate rental may go into much more detail on these and other issues. The real estate may be rented for housing, parking vehicles, storage, business, agricultural, institutional, or government use, or other reasons.
* Who: The parties involved in the contract, the lessor (sometimes called the owner or landlord) and the lessee (sometimes called the renter or tenant) are identified in the contract. A housing lease may specify whether the renter is living alone, with family, children, roommate, visitors. A rental may delineate the rights and obligations of each of these. For example, a &quot;sub-let&quot; to a stranger might not be permitted without permission of the landlord. This also applies to whether or not pets may be kept by the renter. On the other hand, the renter may also have specific rights against intrusions by the landlord (or other tenants), except under emergency circumstances. A renter is in possession of the property, and a landlord would be trespassing upon the renter&#x27;s rights if entry is made without proper notice and authority (e.g., 24 hours&#x27; notice, daytime, knock first, except for emergency repairs, in case of fire, flood, etc.).
* What: Rented real estate may include all or part of almost any real property, such as an apartment, house, building, business offices or suite, land, farm, or merely an inside or outside space to park a vehicle, or store things. The premises rented may include not only specific rooms, but also access to other common areas such as off-street parking, basement or attic storage, laundry facility, pool, roof-deck, balconies, etc. The agreement may specify how and when these places may be used, and by whom. There may be detailed description of the current condition of the premises, for comparison with the condition at the time the premises are surrendered.
* When: the term of the rental may be for a night (e.g., a hotel room), weeks, months, or years. There may be statutory provisions requiring registration of any rental that could extend for more than a specified number of years (e.g., seven) in order to be enforceable against a new landlord.

:A typical rental is either annual or month-to-month, and the amount of rent may be different for long-term renters (because of lower turnover costs). Leaving a long-term lease before its expiration could result in penalties, or even the cost of the entire agreed period (if the landlord is unable to find a suitable replacement tenant, after diligent pursuit). If a tenant stays beyond the end of a lease for a term of years (one or more), then the parties may agree that the lease will be automatically renewed, or it may simply convert to a tenancy at will (month-to-month) at the pro-rated monthly cost of the previous annual lease. If a tenant at will is given notice to quit the premises, and refuses to do so, the landlord then begins eviction proceedings. In many places it is completely illegal to change locks on doors, or remove personal belongings, let alone forcibly eject a person, without a court order of eviction. There may be strict rules of procedure, and stiff penalties (triple damages, plus attorneys&#x27; fees) for violations.
* How much: Rent may be payable monthly, annually, or in advance, or as otherwise agreed. A typical arrangement for tenancy at will is &quot;first and last month&#x27;s rent&quot; plus a security deposit. The &quot;last month&#x27;s rent&quot; is rent that has yet to be earned by the landlord.
In accordance with this, a lease agreement usually includes other critical financial obligations. These factors build upon the basic understanding of rent remittance and are integral to the agreement:

* The overall rent to be paid;
* Potential security or pet deposits;
* The tenant&#x27;s duty to cover certain utility costs;
* Possible property taxes, if applicable;
* The necessary payment for property insurance;
* Any costs associated with repairs;
* Contributions to the maintenance of communal areas (commonly referred to as CAM).

The agreement may also feature terms that explain circumstances for potential increases in rent, among various other conditions.

=== Deposit ===
The security deposit is often handled as an escrow deposit, owned by the tenant, but held by the landlord until the premises are surrendered in good condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted). In some states, the landlord must provide the tenant with the name and account number of the bank where the security deposit is held, and pay annual interest to the tenant. Other regulations may require the landlord to submit a list of pre-existing damage to the property, or forfeit the security deposit immediately (because there is no way to determine whether a prior tenant was responsible). In UK the government has introduced deposit protection scheme leading to several property inventory services which can optionally be used to carry out an inventory.

=== Insurance ===
In order to rent (alternatively called lease) in many apartment buildings, a renter (lessee) is often required to provide proof of renters insurance before signing the rental agreement. There is a special type of the homeowners insurance in the United States specifically for renters—HO-4. This is commonly referred to as renter&#x27;s insurance or renter&#x27;s coverage. Similar to condominium coverage, referred to as a HO-6 policy, a renter&#x27;s insurance policy covers those aspects of the apartment and its contents not specifically covered in the blanket policy written for the complex. This policy can also cover liabilities arising from accidents and intentional injuries for guests as well as passers-by up to 150&#x27; of the domicile. Renter&#x27;s policies provide &quot;named peril&quot; coverage, meaning the policy states specifically what you are insured against. Common coverage areas are:
* Accidental discharge of water
* Fire or lightning
* Smoke
* Theft
* Vandalism or malicious mischief
* Windstorm

Additional events including riot, aircraft, explosion, hail, falling objects, volcanic eruption, snow, sleet, and weight of ice may also be covered.

== Sublease ==
In real estate law, sublease (or, less formally, sublet) is the name given to an arrangement in which the lessee (e.g. tenant) in a lease assigns the lease to a third party, thereby making the old lessee the sublessor, and the new lessee the sublessee, or subtenant. This means they are not only leasing the property, but also subleasing it simultaneously. For example, if a company leases an office space directly from a landlord, the lessor, and subsequently outgrows the office, then the company can sublease the smaller office space to another company, the subtenant, and enter into a new lease for a larger office space, thereby hedging their real estate exposure.

The sublessor remains liable to the original lessor in accordance with the initial lease, including all remaining rent payments, including operating expenses and all other original lease terms. In a down-market, the original lessee may require a lower rent payment from the sublessee than what he or she may have originally paid, leaving the remaining rent owed to the lessor to be paid by the original lessee. However, if market prices have increased since the original lease was signed, the sublessor might be able to secure a higher rent price than what is owed the original lessor. However, many commercial leases stipulate that any overages in rent be shared with the landlord, the lessor.

In residential real estate, it is sometimes illegal to charge the subtenant more than the original amount in the sublessee&#x27;s contract (for instance, in a rent control situation where the rental amount is controlled by law). Subletting of social housing is generally illegal, whatever the rent charged to the subtenant; in the UK it is officially described as a category of housing fraud. In New York the subletting of Mitchell-Lama cooperatives is illegal. Mitchell-Lama residents must maintain a primary residence to remain in their cooperative.

A sublease can also apply to vehicles as an alternate type of car rental. In a vehicle sublease, a lessee or vehicle owner can assign a lease to a third party and by way of contractual agreement for specific dates. Although this arrangement is not popular, it is a growing trend in the travel industry as a less expensive alternative for travelers and locals.

==Equipment leasing==
Leasing is also used as a form of financing to acquire equipment for use and purchase. Many organizations and companies use lease financing for the acquisition and use of many types of equipment, including manufacturing and mining machinery, vessels and containers, construction and off-road equipment, medical technology and equipment, agricultural equipment, aircraft, rail cars and rolling stock, trucks and transportation equipment, business, retail and office equipment, IT equipment and software.

Lease financing for equipment is generally provided by banks, captives and independent finance companies.

<doc id="635696" wikidata="Q7127509" url="?curid=635696" title="Pali Hill">
<text>Pali Hill is an affluent residential area spread across the adjoined suburbs of Bandra and Khar in Mumbai, India (sharing postal codes 400050 and 400052 respectively).

==Geography==
Pali Hill lies on the western side of Mumbai. It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously Carter Road), a popular sea-front and promenade that stretches from Jogger&#x27;s Park, Bandra to the Khar Danda fishing village in Khar.

Situated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the &quot;valleys&quot; and &quot;crests&quot; of the hills. Nearby localities include Pali Village and Pali Naka.

==History==
Until the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.

A few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.

Cottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.

&quot;K. Street Pali Hill&quot; (2004–2006), a thriller television soap on StarPlus, produced by Ekta Kapoor (Balaji Telefilms) was set in the suburb.

==Flora and fauna==
Pali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980 to 2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the gulmohar tree. Large (and rare in Mumbai) banyan trees, peepul trees, mango trees, ashoka trees, wild almond trees, wild neem trees as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the papaya, jackfruit, custard-apple and guava are abundant.

Flowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are bougainvillea, jasmines, birds of paradise flowers and another wild, indigenous varieties.

Pali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, Asian koels, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy Dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both – the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist Salim Ali was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.

Mammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.

==Landmarks==
Pali Hill&#x27;s landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to Pali Naka and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end in Khar is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.

The road diverges downhill on the East side – the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by Dev Anand). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra &amp; former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician – and much more – who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel&#x27;s widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by Reliance ADAGnow Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at &#x27;The Top Of The Hill&#x27; holding and supplying Water to the residents of both sides of the Hill. Further down the southern slopes of the hill resided the Late Nargis Dutt and her husband the late Sunil Dutt, the two besides been thespians were also connected politically Mr. Sunil Dutt, a politician, after he joined the Indian National Congress party, he had the unique distinction of getting elected to the Parliament of India for five terms from the Mumbai North West constituency.
On the bend is the Residence of the famous Dilip Kumar whose thespian wife Saira Banu lives therein.

Down towards Union Park &amp; Golf Links at the North Khar end of the hill is the residence of the former chief minister of Maharashtra Mr. Narayan Rane.
The Golf Course today is no more, it is filed by high rise buildings overseeing the nets of The &quot;Danda&#x27; fishing Village.

<text>Christa Miller-Lawrence (née Miller; born May 28, 1964) is an American actress known for her roles in television comedies. Her foremost roles include Kate O&#x27;Brien in the ABC sitcom &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, Jordan Sullivan in the NBC/ABC comedy series &quot;Scrubs&quot;, Ellie Torres in the ABC/TBS sitcom &quot;Cougar Town&quot;, Liz in the Apple TV+ comedy drama &quot;Shrinking&quot;, and voicing Cleopatra &quot;Cleo&quot; Smith and Candide Sampson in &quot;Clone High&quot;. She has also appeared in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

== Early life ==
Miller&#x27;s days as a child model were curtailed after an operation for a benign bone tumor. After attending Convent of the Sacred Heart, she returned briefly to modeling, but soon took acting lessons, and gave up modeling when she moved to Los Angeles in 1990.

== Career ==
Miller&#x27;s first role on television was in &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;, which starred her real-life aunt, Susan Saint James. She then appeared in episodes of &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, &quot;Fresh Prince of Bel Air&quot;, and &quot;Party of Five&quot;. She had a small role in the horror film &quot;Stepfather III&quot; (1992) with Priscilla Barnes.

She later appeared twice on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, as two different characters. In the 1993 episode &quot;The Sniffing Accountant&quot;, she played the prospective boss of George Costanza. She had intended to be a dramatic actress, and this role proved to be a turning point for Miller, who realized how much she enjoyed comedy. Two years later, she returned to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in &quot;The Doodle&quot; to play George&#x27;s girlfriend, Paula. This episode proved to be a boon to her career, as she convinced co-creator Larry David to provide her with a rough-cut video of the still-unaired episode when she auditioned for &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, whose producers had initially thought she was too inexperienced. David&#x27;s support helped Miller win over the producers of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, who cast her as Kate O&#x27;Brien, whom she played from 1995 to 2002.

In 2001, Miller&#x27;s husband, writer-producer Bill Lawrence, conceived a new comedy drama, &quot;Scrubs&quot;. Miller was given a guest role as Dr. Cox&#x27;s (John C. McGinley) acerbic ex-wife Jordan Sullivan. Originally, the character was intended to appear in only one episode; in season 2, the role became recurring. Miller also was the voice of Cleopatra in the short-lived animated show &quot;Clone High&quot;. She had a leading role in the 2008 two-part TV miniseries &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;. She also appeared in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Divorce Party&quot;.

In 2009, Miller began starring on &quot;Cougar Town&quot;, a sitcom created and produced by her husband and starring Courteney Cox, with whom Miller worked in a three-part story-arc of season 8 of &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

She has starred as Liz on the &quot;Apple TV&quot; series &quot;Shrinking&quot; since 2023.

== Personal life ==
Miller married Bill Lawrence in 1999. They have three children; Charlotte, William, and Henry. Her aunt is actress Susan Saint James.

<doc id="635702" wikidata="Q149591" url="?curid=635702" title="2578 Saint-Exupéry">
<text>2578 Saint-Exupéry, provisional designation , is an Eoan asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 17 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on 2 November 1975, and named after French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Saint-Exupéry&quot; is a member the Eos family (), the largest asteroid family of the outer main belt consisting of nearly 10,000 known members. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,900 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic.

The asteroid&#x27;s was first identified as at McDonald Observatory in Texas. One month later, it was also observed at the Palomar Observatory in May 1952. Its observation arc begins by 23 years prior to its official discovery observation at Nauchnyj.

== Physical characteristics ==

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Saint-Exupéry&quot; measures 17.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.168. Based on its absolute magnitude of 11.5, its generic diameter is between 13 and 30 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25.

As of 2017, &quot;Saint-Exupéry&quot;″s effective composition, rotation period and shape remain unknown.

== Naming ==

The minor planet was named in honour of French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900–1944). The name also alludes to Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s best-known character, &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, who lives on an asteroid.

In the book, the prince&#x27;s asteroid also has a unique code: &quot;B612&quot; (which does not match this minor planet&#x27;s provisional designation). However, there is another asteroid called 46610 Bésixdouze, which is French for &quot;B-six-twelve&quot; (B612 in hexadecimal notation equals 46610).

The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 11 July 1987 ().

<doc id="635705" wikidata="Q1814684" url="?curid=635705" title="Perez (son of Judah)">
<text>Perez, also written as Pharez/Peretz (), was the son of Tamar and Judah, and the twin of Zerah, according to the Book of Genesis. The twins were conceived after Tamar tricked her father-in-law Judah into having sexual intercourse with her by disguising herself as a prostitute. The name is transliterated to English as both &quot;Perez&quot; (NIV, ESV, NKJV) and &quot;Pharez&quot; (KJV). Perez, in Hebrew means &quot;breach or burst forth&quot; and is named after the narrative of his birth as recorded in . According to Ethiopian tradition, Perez became a king of Persia.

== Family tree ==
==Biblical account==

The Book of Ruth lists Perez as being part of the ancestral genealogy of King David, and both the Gospel according to Matthew through Joseph and the Gospel according to Luke through Mary include him when specifying the genealogy of Jesus.

<text>Marquess of Willingdon was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 26 May 1936 for the Liberal politician and colonial governor Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Earl of Willingdon. He was Governor-General of Canada from 1926 to 1931 and Viceroy of India from 1931 to 1936.

Freeman-Thomas had previously been created Baron Willingdon, of Ratton in the County of Sussex, in 1910, Viscount Willingdon, of Ratton in the County of Sussex, on 23 June 1924, and on 20 February 1931, on his retirement as Governor General of Canada, he was made Viscount Ratendone, of Willingdon in the County of Sussex, and Earl of Willingdon. (&quot;Ratendone&quot; was the Domesday Book spelling of the Freeman-Thomas&#x27;s ancestral home in Ratton, Sussex.) These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Upon his death in 1941, the 1st Marquess of Willingdon was succeeded by his only surviving son, Inigo. Inigo was a soldier and also served as Liberal Chief Whip in the House of Lords from 1948 to 1949. Though married three times, he was childless and all the titles became extinct upon his death in 1979.

The marquessate of Willingdon was the most recent marquessate to be created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The most recently created &quot;extant&quot; marquessate is now that of Reading, created in 1926.

<text>A nunatak (from Inuit &quot;nunataq&quot;) is the summit or ridge of a mountain that protrudes from an ice field or glacier that otherwise covers most of the mountain or ridge. They often form natural pyramidal peaks. Isolated nunataks are also called glacial islands, and smaller nunataks rounded by glacial action may be referred to as rognons.

The word is of Greenlandic origin and has been used in English since the 1870s.

==Description==
The term nunatak is typically used in areas where a permanent ice sheet is present and the ridge protrudes above the sheet. Nunataks present readily identifiable landmark reference points in glaciers or ice caps and are often named. While some are isolated, they can also form dense clusters, such as Queen Louise Land in Greenland.

Nunataks are generally angular and jagged, hampering the formation of glacial ice on their tops, although snow can accumulate on them. This can contrast strongly with the softer contours of the glacially eroded land after a glacier retreats. They are not greatly affected by frost weathering, given the low frequency of freeze-thaw cycles in areas of ice caps and ice sheets.

Typically nunataks are the only places where plant life can survive on ice sheets or ice caps. Lifeforms on nunataks are often isolated by the surrounding ice or glacier, providing unique habitats.

<text>Henri Georges de France (7 September 1911 Paris – 29 April 1986 Paris) was a pioneering French television inventor. His inventions include the 819 line French standard and the SECAM color system.

On December 6, 1931, De France founded the Compagnie Générale de Télévision in Le Havre, making television sets with a vertical definition of 60 lines. In February 1932, De France made several transmissions over a distance of 7 km from the &quot;Radio-Normandie&quot; station in Fécamp. These signals were received by a few people located over 100 km away. In October 1932, he achieved a definition of 120 lines. In 1956, he patented the SECAM color television system. On October 1, 1967 at 2:15pm CET, la deuxième chaîne switched from black and white to color using SECAM.

De France is interred in Paris (cimetière du Montparnasse).

The public passage near France Télévisions buildings in Paris is named &quot;Esplanade Henri de France&quot;.

<doc id="635725" wikidata="Q261141" url="?curid=635725" title="String Quartet No. 7 (Beethoven)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 7 in F major, Op. 59, No. 1, was written by Ludwig van Beethoven and published in 1808. This work is the first of three of his &quot;Rasumovsky&quot; cycle of string quartets.

==Overview==
This work is the first of three quartets commissioned by prince Andrey Razumovsky, then the Russian ambassador to Vienna. This quartet is the first of Beethoven&#x27;s middle period quartets and departs in style from his earlier Op. 18 quartets. The most apparent difference is that this quartet is over forty minutes long in a typical performance, whereas most of Beethoven&#x27;s earlier quartets lasted twenty-five to thirty minutes. Furthermore, this quartet notoriously requires a greatly expanded technical repertoire.

==Form==
It consists of four movements:

# Allegro (F major)
# Allegretto vivace e sempre scherzando (B-flat major)
# Adagio molto e mesto - attacca (F minor)
# &quot;Thème Russe&quot;: Allegro (F major)

The first movement is in an expansive sonata form, including a &quot;fugato&quot; in the development and lasting nearly twelve minutes even though it forgoes the then-customary repeat of the exposition. The opening cello melody has its tonality only weakly defined, with the first cadence establishing the key of F major only occurring several bars into the movement.

Another feature of the first movement is the delayed emotional recapitulation. As became one of Beethoven&#x27;s many tools for emotional manipulation, delaying the grandiosity of the recapitulation for several bars after the establishment of the tonic key allowed Beethoven to heighten expectation of a definitive statement.

While both the majestic slow third movement and the fourth are also in sonata form, the second movement scherzo is formally one of the most unusual movements of Beethoven&#x27;s middle period, easily classifiable as being also in sonata form.

The final movement is built around a popular Russian theme, likely an attempt to ingratiate the work to its Russian commissioner.

<doc id="635736" wikidata="Q5677044" url="?curid=635736" title="Harvey Birdman">
<text>Harvey Raymond Randall Birdman is a fictional superhero/attorney at law who first appeared on the Hanna-Barbera show &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot; (1967–1968) as Ray Randall, Birdman, voiced by Keith Andes. After returning as guest host in &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; (1994–2001; 2001–2004; 2006–2008) as Harvey Birdman, voiced by Scott Finnell, he received a new spin-off solo series in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; (2000–2007), voiced by Gary Cole, depicting his legal career. The character returned as United States Attorney General in &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney General&quot; (2018).

==Character history==
===&quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot;===
Birdman was an ordinary human who has been endowed by the sun god Ra with the ability to shoot solar rays from his fists and project quasi-solid &quot;solar shields&quot; to defend himself against attacks (Birdman&#x27;s origin is only vaguely, and only briefly, hinted at during the series. His real name is there given as Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Randall). After he had acquired his avian—and other—powers, he was recruited by a top-secret government agency, Inter-Nation Security, and now works full-time fighting crime, assisted by his pet eagle, who responds to the name of &quot;Avenger&quot;. In addition to the abilities he received from Ra, Birdman also possesses the power of flight, thanks to the giant wings which sprout from his back. It is possible Birdman is fireproof; being forced into an incinerator recharged rather than hurt him. His sole weakness is that he has to recharge his superhuman powers periodically, through exposure either to the sun&#x27;s rays or to a comparable source of heat and/or light such as a desk lamp (when he was once shrunken to insect proportions) or the aforementioned incinerator, a weakness that is exposed in nearly every episode. His trademark is his battle cry of &quot;Biiiiirdman!!!&quot; whenever he goes into battle.

===&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;===
In the 1990s, Cartoon Network decided to base new comedy shows on older characters (although in many cases, that simply meant creating a more or less original character sharing their basic name and appearance). Their earliest show of this style was &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, where Birdman appeared in five episodes, voiced by Scott Finnell. On the show, he was portrayed comically; depressed, out-of-work and desperate for money. Birdman hosted the show in the episodes &quot;Pilot&quot; and &quot;Sequel&quot;, and was fired on both occasions. It was here revealed, contradicting the original &quot;Birdman&quot; show, that his first name was Harvey. &quot;Harvey Birdman&quot; was the name that writer Evan Dorkin came up with.

===&quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;===
Birdman later got his own show, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, now voiced by Gary Cole. In the show, Harvey is a defense attorney, and his clients are generally classic Hanna-Barbera characters given new roles (Fred Flintstone appears, for example, as a mafia don, and Boo-Boo Bear is accused in one episode of being a mad bomber). Many of Birdman&#x27;s former associates and enemies appear on the show in supporting roles (the character Reducto, now given the first name Myron, regularly appears as a prosecuting attorney, and Mentok the Mind-Taker judges cases from late Season One onward). Instead of being a clever superhero, this version of Birdman is portrayed as a semi-competent, bungling lawyer, although among the show&#x27;s increasingly outlandish cast of characters, he is often the straight man. In the series finale, &quot;The Death of Harvey Birdman&quot;, he returns to his superheroing ways, defeating an old enemy before being suddenly hit with a bus and killed.

===Other appearances===
Harvey Birdman, along with Space Ghost, appeared in the background in multiple scenes of the Season 4 episode of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; titled &quot;Members Only&quot;.

Harvey Birdman appeared in the &quot;Villainous&quot; episode &quot;BH&#x27;s Bizzare Bad-Venture&quot;.

Birdman is briefly pictured in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; episode &quot;Epic Rager&quot;, where he is implied to have died as seen in &quot;Attorney at Law&quot;.

<text>Ronald Gerald Wayne (born May 17, 1934) is an American retired electronics industry business executive. He co-founded Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) as a partnership with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs on April 1, 1976, providing administrative oversight and documentation for the new venture. Twelve days later, he sold his 10% share of the new company back to Jobs and Wozniak, for , and one year later accepted a final to forfeit any potential future claims against the newly incorporated Apple.

==Early life and education==
Wayne was born in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, on May 17, 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;ronaldgwayne.com/bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He trained as a technical draftsman at the School of Industrial Art High School in New York City.

==Career==
In 1956, aged 22, he moved to California. In 1971, Wayne started his first business designing and manufacturing slot machines. This venture failed within its first year of operation.

===Atari (1973–1976)===
As Senior Designer, Wayne established the official documentation and materials control systems at Atari. This sophisticated cataloging and inventory tracking system dramatically improved Atari&#x27;s manufacturing efficiency and eliminated substantial losses attributable to lost, duplicated, and mis-filed raw materials required to fabricate final complete video game systems. The documentation system included operating instructions, circuit diagrams, and cabinet designs for all arcade games sold by Atari. As product development manager, he designed video game enclosures and led development of games such as &quot;Gran-Track Racing&quot;. His Atari tenure ended following the Warner Communications acquisition.

===Apple (1976–1977)===
In 1976, Wayne was well respected for his sophisticated and comprehensive internal corporate documentation systems at the three-year-old Atari. There, he met coworkers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. To assist in mediation of one of their typically intense discussions about the design of computers and the future of the industry, Wayne invited the pair to his home to facilitate and advise them. In the ensuing two-hour conversation about technology and business, Jobs proposed the founding of a computer company led by Wozniak and himself. The two would each hold a 45% stake so that Wayne could receive a 10% stake to act as a tie-breaker in their decisions. As the venture&#x27;s self-described &quot;adult in the room&quot; at age 41, Wayne drafted the original partnership agreement, and the three founded Apple Computer on April 1, 1976. Wayne created the first illustrations of the Apple logo (known as Apple Newton). He also wrote the Apple I Operations Manual.

Wayne&#x27;s attitude concerning business was already risk-averse following his experience five years prior with the &quot;very traumatic&quot; failure of his slot machine business, the debts from which he had spent one year repaying. Jobs secured a line of credit to purchase materials needed to fabricate Apple&#x27;s first order placed by the Byte Shop, a business with a reputation as a notoriously slow-paying vendor. This created great anxiety in Wayne concerning his personal financial exposure. Legally, all members of a partnership are personally responsible for any debts incurred by any partner; unlike Jobs and Wozniak, then 21 and 25, Wayne had already acquired a sizable amount of personal assets that potential creditors could possibly seize. Furthermore, his passion was in original product engineering and in slot machines, and not in the documentation systems Jobs and Wozniak expected him to manage, possibly indefinitely at Apple. Believing he was &quot;standing in the shadow of giants&quot; of product-design and eager to shield himself from financial exposure, he exited the company. &quot;Twelve days after Wayne created the document that formally created Apple, he returned to the county registrar&#x27;s office filing an amendment formally withdrawing his name and involvement in the company&quot;. Wayne was later paid in exchange for relinquishing his equity stake in the company. The exact timeframe of this exit has been disputed by Steve Wozniak, who in an interview said that Wayne left the company after a few months.

Wayne has stated in the decades that followed, he does not regret selling his share of the company, as he made the &quot;best decision based on the information available at the time&quot;. He said he had truly believed that the Apple enterprise &quot;would be successful, but at the same time there could be significant bumps along the way and I couldn&#x27;t risk it. I had already had a rather unfortunate business experience. I was getting too old and those two men were whirlwinds. It was like having a tiger by the tail. I couldn&#x27;t keep up with these guys.&quot; Although Apple ended up at one point becoming the most valuable company in the world, he said that given the risks and stress of staying with Apple he &quot;probably would have wound up the richest man in the cemetery.

===Contributions===

* The internal system documentation and inventory tracking systems Wayne developed for Atari were immediately adapted for use by Apple. 
* The first company logo, known as Apple Newton, was crafted by Wayne.
* The original Apple I prototype system was constructed using wire wrap technology, linking the microprocessor and individual circuit components together. Ronald created the detailed printed circuit drawings contained in the &quot;Apple-1 Operations Manual&quot;.
* The detailed printed circuit drawings enabled external creation of the final printed circuit board artwork and fabrication of mass quantities of printed circuit boards, or motherboards.  Motherboards were essential for the new enterprise to mass produce consumer ready Apple I computer systems.
* Ronald created the &quot;Apple-1 Operations Manual&quot;, providing initial consumers with detailed instructions needed for assembly and operation of this new home computing appliance that, in 1976, had no specifically defined purposes. 
* Apple I initially had no formal electronics enclosure or console. Some purchasers improvised using large briefcases as an informal enclosure. For the Apple II, it was necessary to evolve and create a very efficient and effective case to enclose and protect system components.
* To streamline the profile, reduce footprint space and cost, and to eliminate system assembly and system component connections, he devised and implemented a novel horizontally mounted motherboard. This new orientation allows the monitor to be positioned atop the computer enclosure while allowing as many of the individual components to fit within the single console compartment. 

===After Apple===
Shortly after leaving Apple, Wayne resisted Jobs&#x27;s attempts to get him to return, remaining at Atari until 1978, when he joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and later Thor Electronics, an electronics manufacturing company in Salinas, California.

In the late 1970s, Wayne ran a stamp shop in Milpitas, California, for a short time. After several break-ins, he transferred his stamp operations to his home.

Steve Jobs approached him again as a business contact for Apple, but Wayne refused to forward Jobs&#x27;s proposal to purchase a friend&#x27;s company. Wayne believed that his friend should retain ownership of the company, supplying this technology to Apple under exclusive license instead of selling the business. Wayne later expressed regret for interfering with this decision instead of allowing the negotiations to be made directly between the parties.

==Media==
Wayne appeared in the documentary &quot;Welcome to Macintosh&quot; in 2008, where he describes some of his early experiences with Jobs and Wozniak.

In July 2011, Wayne published a memoir titled &quot;Adventures of an Apple Founder&quot;. His plan for initial exclusivity on the Apple Books store did not materialize.

Wayne wrote and released a socioeconomic treatise titled &quot;Insolence of Office&quot;, released on October 1, 2011.

<text>Me and My Girl is a musical with music by Noel Gay and its original book and lyrics by Douglas Furber and L. Arthur Rose. The story, set in the late 1930s, tells of an unapologetically unrefined Cockney gentleman named Bill Snibson, who learns that he is the 14th heir to the Earl of Hareford. The action is set in Hampshire, and in Mayfair and Lambeth in London.

The musical had a successful original run in the West End in 1937, and was turned into a film in 1939, titled &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;, named after one of the show&#x27;s songs. &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot; was also the subject of a news story in &quot;The Times&quot; of October 1938: &quot;While dictators rage and statesmen talk, all Europe dances – to The Lambeth Walk.&quot; The production also included the song &quot;The Sun Has Got His Hat On&quot;.

After returning to the West End briefly in 1952, the musical&#x27;s book received a revision by Stephen Fry with Mike Ockrent in the 1980s. The show was revised again and revived in the West End in 1984, where it received two Laurence Olivier Awards and ran for eight years. The same production was revived on Broadway in 1986 for a three-year run. The production won three of 11 Tony Award nominations.

==Production history==
&quot;Me and My Girl&quot; originally opened on the West End at the Victoria Palace Theatre on 16 December 1937 and starred Lupino Lane. Lane had previously played Bill Snibson in a horseracing comedy play, &quot;Twenty to One&quot;, that opened in 1935. &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; was conceived as a fresh vehicle for the character. At first attracting little notice, the production gained success after a matinee performance was broadcast live on BBC radio following the cancellation of a sporting event. In May 1939, a performance was televised live from the theatre, one of the first such broadcasts; it was rebroadcast that July. The original West End production ran for 1,646 performances.

The musical was revived in 1941, 1945 and 1949 in the West End. Lupino Lane starred and directed each production, with choreography by Fred Leslie. In the 1980s, the book was revised by Stephen Fry and Mike Ockrent. This version included the song &quot;Leaning on a Lamp-post&quot;.

In 1984, another revised production opened at the Leicester Haymarket Theatre with a revised script by Fry and contributions by director Mike Ockrent. It transferred to the Adelphi Theatre on 12 February 1985 and closed on 16 January 1993 after an eight-year run and 3,303 performances. It starred Robert Lindsay as Bill Snibson, Emma Thompson as Sally Smith, and Frank Thornton as Sir John. The production won two Olivier Awards: Musical of the Year and Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Musical (Robert Lindsay). Cast changes included Gary Wilmot, Les Dennis, Enn Reitel and Karl Howman as Bill, and Bonnie Langford, Su Pollard, Louise English, Jessica Martin and Lorraine Chase as Sally. Thornton was succeeded by Nicholas Smith and Patrick Cargill. The production subsequently toured throughout Britain.

The same production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 10 August 1986 and closed on 31 December 1989, after 1,420 performances. Directed by Ockrent with choreography by Gillian Gregory, the cast starred Robert Lindsay and Maryann Plunkett, with George S. Irving and Jane Connell. The production was nominated for 13 Tony Awards in 11 categories and won for Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Choreography. Jim Dale succeeded Lindsay in the lead role of Bill and Ellen Foley succeeded Plunkett as Sally. Lady Jacqueline Carstone was originated by Jane Summerhays, with subsequent performances in the role by Dee Hoty and Janet Aldrich, among others. Irving was succeeded on Broadway by Jay Garner in the role of Sir John Tremayne. Tim Curry played Bill for one year in the US tour that began in October 1987.

Numerous productions have been staged over the years across the UK. In 1997, for example, it was staged at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre for a limited run. A 70th anniversary production had an eight-month British tour during 2006, and the show also played at Sheffield Theatres in 2010.

The Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada, staged a production directed by Ashlie Corcoran and featuring Michael Therriault as Bill and Kristi Frank as Sally, which ran from April through October 2017. An Encores! staged concert in May 2018 starred Christian Borle and Laura Michelle Kelly as Bill and Sally. Warren Carlyle directed and choreographed. The musical was revived at Chichester Festival Theatre from July to August 2018, directed by Daniel Evans and starring Matt Lucas as Bill and Caroline Quentin as the Duchess of Deane.

==Plot==
Setting: London, in and around Hareford Hall, Hampshire; Mayfair and Lambeth in the later 1930s.

;Act I
The Harefords, a family of haughty aristocrats, are seeking the legitimate heir to the title of Earl of Hareford. Bill Snibson, a Cockney from Lambeth, is found and named as the long-lost &quot;Earl of Hareford&quot;. It seems that the 13th Earl had secretly and briefly wed a girl from a bad neighbourhood. However, Bill&#x27;s rough Cockney ways do not satisfy the Will of the last Earl: in order to gain his inheritance of the title and estate, Bill must satisfy the very proper executors (Maria, Duchess of Dene, and Sir John Tremayne) by learning gentlemanly manners. The Duchess thinks that she can make Bill &quot;fit and proper&quot;, but not his Cockney girlfriend, Sally Smith. The Duchess plans a party in Bill&#x27;s honour, but Sally is not to be invited. Sir John tells Sally that she and Bill ought to return to Lambeth, but he is moved by Sally&#x27;s heartfelt declaration of love for Bill (&quot;Once You Lose Your Heart&quot;).

At the party, Bill puts on airs and tries to please his new-found upper-class lawyers, family and servants, but his everyman roots quickly begin to show. Sally shows up in inappropriate garb, with her Lambeth friends, saying that she is going back to where she belongs. Bill seconds this at first, but then teaches the nobility &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;.

;Act II
Bill must make a speech in the House of Lords in coronet and &quot;vermin&quot;-trimmed peer&#x27;s robes. Sally leaves, telling him to marry someone with good blood, and, in a scene inspired by Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, the portraits of Bill&#x27;s ancestors awaken to remind him of his &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;. Bill and Sally have gained an ally in Sir John, who offers to help them by engaging a speech professor (implied to be Henry Higgins from &quot;Pygmalion&quot;) to help Sally impress the Duchess.

Bill constantly bemoans his separation from Sally. Preparing another party for Bill, the Duchess realises how much Sally means to him. This puts her in a romantic mood, and she accepts an offer of marriage from Sir John. Bill, dressed in his old outrageous Cockney clothes, declares that he&#x27;s going home and goes upstairs to pack. Just then, Sally astonishes everyone by arriving in an elegant gown and tiara and speaking with a perfect upper-crust accent. When Bill returns downstairs, Sally conceals her identity; when she reveals it, Bill is relieved and the couple gain the acceptance of the family.

<doc id="635768" wikidata="Q3536028" url="?curid=635768" title="Iroquois kinship">
<text>Iroquois kinship (also known as bifurcate merging) is a kinship system named after the Haudenosaunee people, also known as the &quot;Iroquois&quot;, whose kinship system was the first one described to use this particular type of system. Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot;, the Iroquois system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese).

==Kinship system==
The system has both classificatory and descriptive terms. In addition to gender and generation, Iroquois kinship also distinguishes &#x27;same-sex&#x27; and &#x27;cross-sex&#x27; parental siblings: the brothers of Ego&#x27;s (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) father, and the sisters of Ego&#x27;s mother, are referred to by the same parental kinship terms used for Ego&#x27;s Father and Mother. The sisters of Ego&#x27;s father, and the brothers of Ego&#x27;s mother, on the other hand, are referred to by non-parental kinship terms, commonly translated into English as &quot;Aunt&quot; and &quot;Uncle&quot;.

The children of one&#x27;s parents&#x27; same-sex siblings, i.e. parallel cousins, are referred to by sibling kinship terms. The children of Aunts or Uncles, i.e. cross cousins, are not considered siblings, and are referred to by kinship terms commonly translated into English as &quot;cousin&quot;. In some systems, the kinship terms applied to cross-cousins are the same as those applied to brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, due to preferential marriage practices (see below).
==Marriage==
Ego (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) is encouraged to marry his cross-cousins but discouraged or prohibited from marrying his parallel cousins. In many societies with Iroquois kinship terminologies, the preferred marriage partners include not only first cousins (mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s children and father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s children), but more remote relatives who are also classified as cross-cousins by the logic of the kinship system. Preferential cross-cousin marriage can be useful in reaffirming alliances between unilineal lineages or clans.

==Usage==
The term Iroquois comes from the six Iroquois tribes of northeastern North America. Another aspect of their kinship was that the six tribes all had matrilineal systems, in which children were born into the mother&#x27;s clan and gained status through it. Women controlled some property, and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line. A woman&#x27;s eldest brother was more important as a mentor to her children than their father, who was always of a different clan.

&quot;Iroquois tradition had the lineage of the clan or tribe traced through the mother&#x27;s side. However, the amount of power women held in the tribe decreased with time due to the American revolution.&quot; (Lappas, Thomas).

Some groups in other countries also happen to be independently organized for kinship by the Iroquois system. It is commonly found in unilineal descent groups. These include:
#The Anishinaabe of North America, who include the Algonquin, Nipissing, Mississauga, Ojibwe, Saulteaux, Odawa and Potawatomi peoples. Many of these people were traditional neighbors to the Iroquois, but they spoke languages of the Algonquian family.

Other populations found to have the Iroquois system are
#Most of the Bantu-speaking cultures of Eastern and Southern sub-Saharan Africa — see Sesotho kinship for an example.
#Many Melanesian societies.

===South India and Sri Lanka===

Some communities in South India use the kinship tradition described above.

===Melanesia===
Many of the cultures of Vanuatu use this type of kinship system. In Bislama (Vanuatu pidgin), paternal uncles and maternal aunts are referred to as &quot;smol papa&quot; &quot;small father&quot; and &quot;smol mama&quot; &quot;small mother&quot; respectively.

<doc id="635775" wikidata="Q3366186" url="?curid=635775" title="Parti bleu">
<text>The Parti bleu (, &quot;Blue Party&quot;) was a political group that contested elections in the Eastern section of the Province of Canada. The Blue Party was ideologically located on the political right, and was defined by its support for the Catholic Church, and later for supporting confederation.

The party was formed in 1854 by conservative members of the former Reform movement, following in the tradition of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Francis Hincks. The first leader of the Blue Party, George-Étienne Cartier, was the Premier of Canada East. The Parti bleu held majorities in Canada East uninterrupted from 1854 to 1867, and often formed coalition governments with the English-speaking Conservatives from Canada East, and the Liberal-Conservative Party from Canada West. Their main electoral challenge came from the Parti rouge, a secularist left-wing party. After confederation in 1867, the party was dissolved, and members became part of the Conservative Party of Quebec at the provincial level, and the Conservative Party of Canada federally.

== History ==

The Reform Party was a broad movement, organized around achieving responsible government in the Province of Canada. Because responsible government was required to enact any form of self-government, it was supported by both liberals and conservatives who could not achieve their own policy aims without it. The Reform Party was thus able to draw in members from across the ideological spectrum. After 1848, when responsible government was introduced by the Imperial Government, the unifying policy of the movement had been achieved and the movement began to break down. By 1853, the government was unable to secure majorities on core legislation. By the time of election in 1854, the party had broken down into factions based on their ideological positions. The French-Canadian conservatives initially called themselves Ministerialists, in recognition of their support of the government and opposition of the Rouges and Liberals. By 1856, the Ministerialist faction had changed their name to Bleu.

The Ministerialists experienced electoral success in the Canadian general election, 1854. They won 35 seats in Canada East, forming the largest group out of the Eastern members. Their strong electoral performance allowed them to form a coalition government with the Canada West Conservatives led by Allan MacNab. Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché was the first leader of the Ministerialist group, but was replaced by George-Étienne Cartier as the Blue Party was formed. The coalition between the Canada West Conservatives and Blue Party began the Liberal-Conservative tradition of government in the province.

After the 1858 election, the Blue Party and Eastern-Canadian Conservatives became the largest group in the Legislative Assembly, and formed a coalition government with the Canada West Conservatives as the larger partner. Canada West had returned a majority of Liberal members, but the large majority commanded by the Blue Party and Conservatives in Canada East prevented the Liberals from taking power. The number of factions in the legislature made it difficult to secure majorities on government legislation, forcing the Blue-Conservative coalition out for a four-day period in 1858 after losing a non-confidence vote. However, the new Liberal-Rouge government was unable to secure a majority in the Legislative Assembly, and the Blue Party reformed a ministry with the Conservatives.

== Ideology ==
The Blue Party was ideologically moderate, established from the former reformers in Canada East. The party supported Confederation, the role of the Catholic Church in Canadian society, and the dismantling of the seigneurial system. The Blue Party was opposed to the anti-clerical and republican positions of the Parti rouge.

<text>Sealing wax is a wax material of a seal which, after melting, hardens quickly (to paper, parchment, ribbons and wire, and other material), forming a bond that is difficult to break without noticeable tampering. Wax is used to verify that something such as a document is unopened, to verify the sender&#x27;s identity (for example with a seal stamp or signet ring), and as decoration. Sealing wax can also be used to take impressions of other seals. Wax was used to seal &quot;letters close&quot; and later, from about the 16th century, envelopes. Long before sealing wax was employed, the Romans used bitumen for this purpose.

==Composition==


Formulas vary, but there was a major shift after European trade with the Indies opened. In the Middle Ages, sealing wax was typically made of beeswax and &quot;Venice turpentine&quot;, a greenish-yellow resinous extract of the European larch tree. The earliest wax of this kind was uncoloured. Later the wax was coloured red with vermilion. From the 16th century it was compounded of various proportions of shellac, turpentine, resin, chalk or plaster, and colouring matter (often vermilion, or red lead), but not necessarily beeswax. The proportion of chalk varied; coarser grades are used to seal wine bottles and fruit preserves, finer grades for documents. In some situations, such as putting large seals on public documents, beeswax was used. On occasion, sealing wax has historically been perfumed by ambergris, musk and other scents.

By 1866, many different colours were available: gold (using mica), blue (using smalt or verditer), black (using lamp black), white (using lead white), yellow (using the mercuric mineral turpeth, also known as Schuetteite), green (using verdigris) and so on. Some users, such as the British Crown, assigned different colours to different types of documents. Today a range of synthetic colours are available.

==Method of application==

Sealing wax is available in the form of sticks, sometimes with a wick, or as granules. The stick is melted at one end (but not ignited or blackened), or the granules heated in a spoon, normally using a flame, and then placed where required, usually on the flap of an envelope. While the wax is still soft and warm, the seal (preferably at the same temperature as the wax, for the best impression) should be quickly and firmly pressed into it and released.

==Modern use==

At the end of 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, sealing wax was used in laboratories as a vacuum cement. It was gradually replaced by other materials, like plasticine, but according to Nobel Laureate Patrick Blackett, &quot;at one time it might have been hard to find in an English laboratory an apparatus which did not use red Bank of England sealing-wax as a vacuum cement.&quot;

Since the advent of a postal system, the use of sealing wax has become more for ceremony than security. Modern times have required new styles of wax, allowing for mailing of the seal without damage or removal. These new waxes are flexible for mailing and are referred to as glue-gun sealing wax, faux sealing wax and flexible sealing wax. Traditional sealing wax candles are produced in Canada, Spain, Mexico, France, Italy and Scotland, with formulations similar to those used historically.

<doc id="635781" wikidata="Q5753152" url="?curid=635781" title="Hierarchy of precious substances">
<text>In popular culture, sets of precious substances may form hierarchies which express conventional perceived relative value or merit. Precious metals appear prominently in such hierarchies, but as they grow, gems and semi-precious materials may be introduced as part of the system. The sequences can provide interesting examples of the arbitrariness of semiotic signs.

==Traditional manifestations==
Jubilees have a hierarchy of years: 

Wedding anniversaries extend the jubilee hierarchy with various sequences of substances filling in many of the gaps between the same major milestones. In 2017 the 65th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II was widely referred to as her &quot;sapphire jubilee&quot; or more specifically as her &quot;blue&quot; sapphire jubilee (see Sapphire Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II) but more traditionally the sapphire anniversary is considered to be the 45th. In general usage no precious stone is considered to outrank the diamond. 

Ancient Greek mythic-cultural cosmology depicted a decline from a golden age to a silver age followed by an Iron Age. In some variants there is a Bronze Age, an interim between the Iron Age and Silver Age.

In Japan, the traditional &quot;Sho Chiku Bai&quot; (松竹梅) ranking system has a hierarchy of pine , bamboo , and plum . This is commonly used by restaurants to indicate how elaborate (and expensive) set meals are.

==Modern adaptations==
The measurement of sales of popular music starts high relative to the wedding anniversary scale, concentrating on gold and platinum (see gold album). Likewise, credit card companies usually have a &quot;gold card&quot; and a &quot;platinum card&quot; (many formerly had a &quot;silver card&quot; then followed by a &quot;gold card&quot;, but due to similarity in appearance between silver and platinum these were often discontinued with the rise in popularity of platinum as a precious metal).

Sports events have a well-established convention (introduced into the Olympic tradition at the 1904 Summer Olympics), of a hierarchy of medals: bronze medal silver medal gold medal. This presumably echoes conventional coinage systems, in which cheap bronze or copper denominations could aggregate to intermediate silver coins, then to gold money. The archetypal British designations (penny, shilling and pound) parallel and reflect this hierarchy.

Events-sponsorship in sport or in the arts may involve (for example) silver, gold and/or platinum sponsors.

Fantasy role playing games often have a hierarchy of materials, following the relative strengths of pre-modern metals, bronze, iron and steel, for example, at the lower end, and moving up through fantastic or legendary materials such as mithril and adamant.

Some multiplayer video games feature a hierarchy of players that uses precious metal names to distinguish the various levels of skill, often progressing from Bronze to Silver, to Gold, to Platinum, then to Diamond.
