<text>The Holden Monaro ( ) is a car that was manufactured by General Motors&#x27; Australian division Holden. It has a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and was produced with a two-door coupé body from 1968 to 1975 and again from 2001 to 2006 and with a 4-door sedan body from 1973 to 1977.

Three generations of the Monaro coupe have been produced, the first covering the HK, HT, and HG series from 1968 to 1971, the second covering the HQ and HJ series from 1971 to 1975, and the third covering the V2 and VZ series from 2001 to 2005.

The first generation Monaro coupe was also manufactured by General Motors South Africa in 1970 and 1971 in both Holden Monaro GTS and Chevrolet SS variants, utilising CKD kits imported from Australia.

The third generation Monaro coupe was manufactured not only for domestic Australian consumption but also for export as variously a Chevrolet Lumina (Middle East), Vauxhall Monaro (UK), or Pontiac GTO (USA) badged vehicle. The third generation was also &#x27;remanufactured&#x27; in Australia by HSV (Holden Special Vehicles) from 2001 to 2006, marketed in a range of HSV-badged high performance derivatives without application of the Monaro nameplate.

== First generation (1968–1971) ==
=== HK ===
Named after the Monaro region in New South Wales (although pronounced differently), Holden&#x27;s new coupé was introduced in July 1968 in a two-door pillarless hardtop design available in three models: base, GTS and GTS 327. The GTS versions had the full instrumentation installed which included a tachometer mounted on the centre console. This proved to be a bad location, as the driver&#x27;s knee would obstruct the view and it often rattled.

The base Monaro had a standard straight-6 engine or the extra-cost options of two versions of straight-6 engines (Monaro GTS came standard with the more powerful 186&#x27;S&#x27; engine), and both base model and GTS could be optioned with a Chevrolet-sourced V8 engine.

The exclusive Monaro &#x27;GTS 327&#x27; model was powered by a Chevrolet V8 engine rated at , available only with a 4-speed manual transmission.

Despite the styling being unique, the Monaro nevertheless featured styling cues derived from GM designs, employing a &quot;coke bottle&quot; look similar to that of the Camaro, Corvair, and Nova coupés of the late 1960s.

After Holden engineers had originally claimed that the Monaro&#x27;s engine bay was too small to house the 327 Chevrolet V8, a decision was made to speed up the development of Holden&#x27;s first ever Australian-developed and manufactured V8 engine, the and larger capacity Holden V8 engine. However, as this particular V8 engine project ran behind schedule, this led to engineers remeasuring the engine bay and finding that the original measurement calculations had been incorrect, thus allowing the use of the imported Chevrolet engines.

The HK Monaro GTS327 gave Holden its first victory in the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 at the hands of Bruce McPhee and co-driver Barry Mulholland. Whilst Mulholland only drove one of the total 130 race laps, McPhee drove the remainder and also scored both pole position and fastest lap of the race.

Norm Beechey drove a HK Monaro GTS327 to third place in the 1969 Australian Touring Car Championship, the first time the ATCC was held as a series rather than a single race. Beechey showed the capabilities of the Monaro when he won the final two rounds of the five-round series at Surfers Paradise and Symmons Plains.

In early 1969, the HK Monaro range was awarded &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1968.
=== HT ===

In June 1969, the HK Monaro was replaced by the facelifted HT Monaro. The &#x27;GTS 327&#x27; became the &#x27;GTS 350&#x27; with the replacement of the Chevrolet 327 in3 (5.4 L) V8 by the Chevrolet 350 in3 (5.7 L) V8. As the Monaro was Holden&#x27;s main car in Series Production racing, this was primarily in response to Ford who had introduced the XW Falcon GTHO Phase I in 1969. There was also an automatic version of the &#x27;GTS 350&#x27; introduced which used a lower power version of the 350 in3 (5.7 L) engine coupled to a 2-speed Powerglide transmission. HT Monaro also marked the phasing out of the 5.0-litre Chevrolet V8, and the introduction of Holden&#x27;s own locally made V8 engines, the 4.2-litre 253, and the 5.0-litre 308. Late in the HT model run, a new locally produced 3-speed automatic transmission, the Trimatic, was offered as an option, although it was not available on the &#x27;GTS 350&#x27;.

The HT Monaro can be distinguished from the HK by the adoption of plastic grilles (previously metal), two section taillights separated by a blacked out panel, a round speedometer instead of &quot;strip&quot; style allowing for bringing the tachometer into the main instrument cluster instead of on the floor console, rubber front suspension bushes instead of the HK&#x27;s sintered bronze, and larger taillights where the turn indicators also wrapped around the now slightly undercut edges. Bodywork &#x27;go-faster&#x27; stripe designs (delete options) varied for each series; HK stripes were offset to the driver&#x27;s side of the bonnet (hood) and bootlid (trunk), the HT had two broad stripes down the centre of the car. HT also had twin air scoops / vents incorporated into their bonnet, which served no real purpose in delivering air into the engine bay.

The HT Monaro GTS350 was successful in Series Production racing. The Holden Dealer Team was formed in 1969 by longtime Ford Works Team boss Harry Firth with the team using the GTS350 in competition. The HDT entered three Monaros in the 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 the lead car driven by Colin Bond and Tony Roberts winning from 1968 winners Bruce McPhee and Barry Mulholland who had switched to driving a Falcon GTHO. Coming home third in the Dealer Team&#x27;s 3rd Monaro was Des West and Bathurst rookie Peter Brock.

In January 1970, Bond and Roberts would win the Rothmans 12 Hour Series Production race at Surfers Paradise driving their HDT Holden Monaro.

Norm Beechey upgraded to a HT GTS350 and would win the 1970 Australian Touring Car Championship, Holden&#x27;s first ever ATCC championship success. Beechey won three of the seven rounds at Bathurst, Sandown and Lakeside where he wrapped up the title. The Monaro (which Beechey and his chief mechanic Pat Purcell had bored out from 5.7 to 6.0 litres) proved too much for the opposition which included defending champion Ian Geoghegan in his Ford Mustang, Allan Moffat in his Ford Mustang Boss 302 Trans-Am, Bob Jane&#x27;s Mustang and Beechey&#x27;s own teammate Jim McKeown in a Porsche 911S. Beechey&#x27;s win was all the more remarkable considering he failed to finish at Warwick Farm and did not start the final round at Symmons Plains after suffering an engine failure in qualifying. He also finished 2nd to Geoghegan in round 4 at Mallala.

Beechey would continue to run the Monaro (dubbed &quot;Trans-Aus&quot; in reference to its Australian build compared to the American Trans-Am cars of his opposition) for another two seasons, though unreliability plagued the car in 1971 and 1972. Norm only finished fifth in the 1971 ATCC, winning only round two at Calder. The 1972 ATCC saw Beechey retire from the first three rounds at Symmons Plains, Calder and Bathurst before his only points for the series came from a third place in round four at Sandown Park. At the end of 1972 as a result of the Supercar scare, the Improved Production class was shut down by CAMS with a new production based Group C touring car class introduced for which the Monaro was not eligible to race.

=== HG ===
Unveiled on 26 July 1970, the HG Monaro was the last of the original coupé design concept. HG had cleaner lines with redesigned exterior trim pieces. The HG sported different stripes (delete options) known as &quot;sidewinder&quot; stripes which ran along the top edge of the fenders, under the windows and finishing just before the rear pillar. The &quot;Monaro&quot; badge on both rear pillars was introduced to all models. For the HG GTS, the &quot;GTS&quot; badges now featured black paint fill, received new black-out paint on rocker panels, with the GTS 350 getting bold treatment with new &quot;sidewinder&quot; stripes and black bonnet scoop. &quot;GTS 350&quot; designations now featured gutsier decals on the fenders and boot lid. Wheel arch moldings were deleted on all models. The &quot;GTS 350&quot; models no longer had the 350 Chevrolet badge on the fender, but rather a bold decal stating &quot;350&quot; as well as blackout treatment that covered the air-vents on the bonnet. The GTS badge originally above the gills in the fenders would be removed and would now be black instead of red (with the badges being placed on the passenger side of the grille and boot). The taillights had a cleaner look and the grille was redesigned.

Most mechanical specifications remained the same as HT series, with the exception of Monaro GTS (non-350), which had softened suspension, resulting in a smoother ride. Manual HG GTS 350 retained the suspension from the HT GTS 350. Other upgrades included thicker (HT GTS 350 style) power front disc brakes, now standard for all V8 and the 6-cylinder Monaro GTS. The HG would be the final model for the generation and the last to use the original body shell.

=== Export program ===

HT and HG series Monaro GTS coupes were assembled in South Africa from imported parts by General Motors South Africa (GMSA) at the Port Elizabeth assembly plant. Later the HG series Monaro was assembled and sold in South Africa badged as the Chevrolet SS. At this time GMSA had made a decision to market most of its products as Chevrolets. The Chevrolet SS had revised front styling unique to that model, incorporating four headlights and large turn indicators in the front edge of the fenders above the bumper. The Holden Monaro and Chevrolet SS models were both available with Holden 308 in3 (5.0L) and the Chevrolet 350 in3 (5.7 L) engines. South African sales totalled 1,828 Monaros and 1,182 SS models.
== Second generation (1971–1977) ==
=== HQ ===

A completely new body design emerged with the HQ series in July 1971, including the new Monaro &#x27;LS&#x27; (commonly believed to mean &quot;Luxury Sports&quot;) model which featured four headlights and chrome trim rings shared with the Holden Premier sedan. There were no longer any six-cylinder versions of the Monaro GTS, just the locally manufactured or optional V8s or the top level GTS350 coupé, equipped with an imported Chevrolet motor.

The base model Monaro standard engine was enlarged to whilst the Monaro LS had a broad spectrum of engine options from a six to the V8. The new coupé design had a much larger rear window and a squarer rear quarter window; it was somehow seen as not as sporty looking compared to the earlier HK-HT-HG series, but is often now considered one of the best looking body designs to come from an Australian manufacturer. Taillights were now rectangular in dual-unit style, integrated into the rear bumper; they were not unlike those of the American 1969 Chevrolet Bel Air/Biscayne. The car&#x27;s styling was somewhat reminiscent of the 1970-72 Chevrolet Chevelle.
Until 1973, the HQ Monaro GTS did not have any exterior graphics and the L48 Chevy V8 was a little less potent than in previous HT/HG versions rated at at 4,800 rpm and of torque at 3,200 rpm, especially with the optional Turbo-hydramatic 400, 3-speed automatic transmission. This and the fact that the same 350 engine was also available as on option in the large Statesman luxury sedan, probably contributed to a downgrade of the Monaro GTS range in muscular image terms, as did the replacement of the bigger coupés with the inline-six engine Holden Torana GTR XU-1 as the chosen GM car for Australian touring car racing. The introduction of bonnet and bootlid paint-outs in 1973 coincided with the release of the HQ Monaro GTS in four-door sedan configuration. It is generally considered that Holden created the bold contrasting paint-outs so the new Monaro GTS sedan would not be mistaken for the humble Kingswood sedan upon which it was based.

The continued erosion of the GTS350 cachet was compounded by the deletion of specific &quot;350&quot; decals on the post-1973 cars, with all Monaro GTS coupés and sedans now being externally labelled with the generic HQ series &#x27;V8&#x27; bootlid badge. In the final year of HQ production, i.e. 1974, the manual-transmission version of the GTS350 was discontinued and sales of the automatic version were minimal prior to the engine option being discontinued.

A 1972 model year two-door base Monaro was used in the film &quot;Mad Max as the MFP Pursuit Special driven by the Nightrider during the film&#x27;s opening chase scene&quot;.

=== HJ ===
Introduced in October 1974, the HJ Monaro incorporated a heavy facelift and some model rationalisation. Its front end bore a resemblance to the 1970–1972 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The 350 V8 engine option and the base Monaro coupé were both discontinued. The Monaro GTS continued to be available as a coupé or sedan with the V8 engine, or the optional V8 engine. The Monaro LS coupé also continued within the range, but still with the 3.3-litre six-cylinder engine as its base power unit.

The body paint-outs were discontinued in the HJ Monaro GTS range, but for the first time, the Monaro could be specified with optional front and rear spoilers.

The HJ Monaro LS coupé is close to being the rarest regular production car ever made in Australia with only 337 units produced. The HJ Monaro GTS coupé was discontinued during 1975 due to falling demand, 606 examples of the GTS were made.
=== HX ===
New emissions regulations heralded the mildly facelifted HX Monaro GTS sedan, announced in July 1976. The HX was quite distinguishable, with liberal splashes of black paintouts contrasted against a range of bold body colours, and a choice of traditional chrome or body painted bumper bars.


;Limited Edition
Holden had a limited number of HJ coupe panel sets in 1975 and a decision was made to do something special with them. The solution was to create the Limited Edition, or LE, which was not released until 27 September 1976. More than 600 body shells were assembled at the Pagewood body plant as HJ bodies in white late in 1975, but due to delays, the HX series came around before LE production begun, thus mandating the cars to be converted to HX which meant body shell changes. Some of those bodies were utilised to build HJ coupes prior to the cessation of HJ coupe production partway through 1976 and prior to the end of the HJ series. All LE cars were painted in an exclusive metallic colour called LE Red. The LE was not badged or officially referred to as a Monaro. The LE was an amalgam of prestige and surplus parts (including an eight-track cartridge player well after cassette tapes were common), in effect a combination of Monaro GTS and Statesman Caprice components. The LE had a price tag to match: AUD$11,500. The cars were built at the now-defunct Pagewood (Sydney) plant. Production totalled 580 cars.
The distinctive US sourced honeycomb wheels fitted to the LE, which resembled those of the second generation Pontiac Firebird, were created by a plastic mould adhered to the outside of conventional steel wheel rims. These were a gold painted version of the same wheel that had been available as an option on passenger vehicles since early in the HJ series. The front end styling of this pillarless hardtop resembles a smaller-scale 1971 U.S. specification Chevrolet Caprice.

=== HZ ===

Although the Monaro name had survived into 1977 as the HX Monaro GTS sedan, the coupé configuration was no longer in production and Holden decided to delete the Monaro name altogether from the new Holden HZ range. With the development of Radial Tuned Suspension, Holden transformed the bland characteristics of their full-size sedans and introduced a sporting variant called simply Holden GTS. Released on 5 October 1977, this HZ variant featured a four headlight grille, front and rear air dams, four-wheel disc brakes, sports wheels and a 4.2-litre V8 engine as standard equipment. The optional 5.0-litre V8 became standard in June 1978. With the November 1978 introduction of the new mid/full-size Commodore VB sedan and its availability with V8 engine, the days of the GTS appeared numbered. Production of the GTS ceased in December 1978, an estimated 1,438 were built.
Ultimately, the VB Commodore proved very popular in both six-cylinder and V8 forms, such that all full-size HZ Holden passenger cars were phased out of production in 1980. Remnants of the H-series lived on in the Holden WB series commercial vehicle range and in the revamped Statesman WB luxury sedans that were manufactured until December 1984.
== Third generation (2001–2006) ==
After 25 years of absence of a full-size Holden coupe, the Monaro made a return in November 2001 following the overwhelming response of the public and media to the Commodore VT-based Holden Coupé concept displayed at the 1998 Australian International Motor Show held in Sydney. The third generation of the Monaro was produced from 2001 to 2005. The HSV Coupé saw production through to June 2006, with HSV variants on sale until August 2006.

=== V2 ===

After a gestation period of 22 months (contrary to the planned 12 to 18 months) and at a cost of A$60 million, Holden launched the V2-series Monaro based on the VX-series Commodore. It was available as the CV6, with a supercharged 3.8 L V6 and 4-speed automatic transmission (production ceased in mid-2004), and as the CV8, featuring the 5.7 L LS1 V8, with a choice of either a 6-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. A Series 2 model debuted in December 2002 with a revised dashboard from the VY-series, a new alloy road wheel design and new paint and trim colour choices. The CV6 model was dropped after disappointing sales (reputedly 10 times as many CV8s were built compared to CV6s) when a Series 3 model appeared in 2004.

A limited edition model called the CV8-R was introduced in July 2003, all 350 of which were made in Turbine Mica (grey metallic) paint colour. A revised CV8-R model would appear again in May 2004 (based on the Series 3 CV8), all 320 of which were made in an exclusive Pulse Red paint colour. Other unique features of the 2004 CV8-R cars included 18&quot; five-spoke machined face alloy wheels, smoked front and rear lamp treatment, and a “Holden By Design” electric sunroof. The interior featured the centre fascia and instrument surrounds in satin finish, “Pulse Red” and black floor-mats with CV8-R logo, a unique instrument cluster with white dial-plate daytime illumination, and leather trimming for the steering wheel, handbrake and transmission selectors (matching anthracite leather was used for the sports seats and door trims, with perforated leather inserts and black stitching).

=== VZ ===
On 12 September 2004, Holden introduced the VZ Monaro CV8 with a 15 kW increase in engine power when compared to the previous V2-series cars. The VZ series at first came in only four paint colours (Phantom, Devil, Turismo and Quicksilver) and later saw the addition of a fifth colour named Fusion, seen only in the closing of production CV8-Z model. The VZ Monaro CV8 was upgraded in other ways too, receiving a 10-speaker audio system with two built-in subwoofers, new front/rear bumper assemblies, dual exhaust system and various other small changes. The revised rear bumper, dual exhaust system, and new hood with air intakes would soon find their way onto the export Pontiac GTO. However, in July 2005, Holden announced that production of the current generation VZ Monaro CV8 would soon be coming to an end and this led to the run of a special edition model called the CV8-Z, of which 1,605 units were ultimately made.

The last Holden Monaro-badged coupé was purchased by Emerald, Queensland businessman Darryl Mattingley for A$187,355.55—around three times the normal retail price, on 19 February 2006. The car was bought through eBay, with the proceeds going to the Leukaemia Foundation.

The Holden Monaro CV8-Z was produced to farewell the legendary Monaro name, much like what had been done with the LE coupé back in 1976. &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine tested a CV8-Z in the March 2006 issue with a Ford Mustang GT and a Nissan 350Z. They summed up the test with, &quot;The Monaro eats Mustangs and spits out Nissans. It&#x27;s a class act that deserves an encore performance.&quot; The CV8-Z was offered in the same colours as the standard CV8 but to highlight the model, a new colour was introduced called &#x27;Fusion&#x27; orange/gold metallic with unique colour matching (Fusion and black) leather interior. The CV8-Z had unique features including a sunroof, modified darkened taillights, signature black bonnet scoop accents, special engraved CV8-Z wheels, CV8-Z badging throughout the interior and gun metal chrome CV8-Z badging on the exterior. Tony Hyde, the chief engineer of Holden, announced on his retirement in 2007 that being a part of the development of modern Monaro&#x27;s was his proudest achievement. He described the modern Monaro program as &quot;pure emotion&quot; and that his Monaro will be kept next to his 1976 Chevrolet Corvette.
== Badge engineered Monaro models (2001–2006) ==

The Monaro was used as a basis for various concept cars and was used by several different brands, HSV in Australia, Chevrolet in the Middle East, Pontiac in North America, and Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom.

=== HSV Coupé ===

The HSV Coupé is a high performance iteration which was produced by Holden Special Vehicles from 2001 to 2006. It was originally based on the Monaro V2 series but did not carry the Monaro name.

As in the case of the Commodore-based HSV sedan range, the Coupé&#x27;s body was built at the Holden manufacturing plant in Elizabeth, South Australia, and then transported and modified at HSV&#x27;s Clayton production facility. The initial range consisted of two models, the GTO and GTS, which were differentiated by their engine and exterior design. The entry-level GTO was originally powered by a Chevrolet LS1 V8 engine, whereas the GTS had a Callaway C4B V8 engine rated at . Externally, the GTS differed from the GTO in having contrasting colour accents on the bumpers and side skirts.

The GTO&#x27;s engine output increased to in the Series II upgrade of March 2003, and with the Series III upgrade of September 2003. Other additions brought by the latter upgrade included a revised exhaust system and extra cabin instrumentation. Between September 2003 to July 2004, a GTO LE (Limited Edition) was also available for sale.

With the Series III upgrade, the GTS became a special order only model and was discontinued in 2004. In May of that year, HSV launched the new luxury-oriented Coupé4, which was essentially a modified GTO fitted with HSV&#x27;s first all-wheel-drive system and cost A$89,950. Due to powertrain limitations, it was powered by the older LS1 V8 engine. The all-wheel-drive system was developed in-house by HSV rather than being an adaptation of the then existing system used by Holden on its Adventra wagon or Crewman and Cross 8 utility range. Conjecture surrounds the total number of Coupé4s built, claimed to be 134 units (28 Series III models; 106 VZ; 6 pilot cars) of which 20 were exported to New Zealand available only in Phantom Black, Quicksilver and Sting Red.

The Z Series facelift of October 2004 aligned the GTO&#x27;s engine output to the other HSV Z Series models. It featured a &quot;LS2&quot; V8 engine, rated at at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm also found on the C6 Corvette, a boot-mounted fuel tank, dual exhaust pipes, new bonnet scoops, and revised manual and automatic gearboxes. In line with the announcement made by Holden in July 2005 about the Monaro&#x27;s end of production, HSV again released a GTO LE from April 2006 (featuring three body colour and stripe combinations for just 50 units in black, 25 in yellow and 25 in red) plus a final &#x27;Signature&#x27; limited edition. The Signature Coupe&#x27;(with a total production of 70 units), announced in July 2006 and for sale in August 2006 this model would be the last monaro/GTO and last two door coupe&#x27; manufactured in Australia. This signature model retailed for A$83,990 plus on road costs when new and gained HSV&#x27;s top-of-the-line AP racing brake package with coloured front six-piston calipers with 362mm cross-drilled and grooved rotors and rear four-piston calipers with 343mm cross-drilled and grooved rotors, 19 inch multi-spoke rims (found on the HSV GTS-R Coupe concept car) sunroof and unique paint scheme as standard. In recognition of the significance HSV also reversed the order of build numbers with the last signature Coupe off the manufacturing line receiving a #1/70 rather than HSV&#x27;s conventional numbering system.

=== Other variants ===

Just like HSV, independent manufacturer Corsa Specialised Vehicles (CSV) also produced its own version of the Monaro, badged the Mondo (&quot;world&quot; in Italian) and based on V2 series. It came in three distinctive GT models depending on engine power.

In 2003, German manufacturer Bitter Cars instead previewed a rebodied Monaro, badged as the CD II and to be fitted with a V12 engine. This project, however, never reached full production.

=== Export program ===
The third generation Monaro was exported to several overseas markets. It was also sold, in left-hand drive, in the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupé, and in the United States as the Pontiac GTO, reviving another classic muscle car icon. However, at least one commentator has described it as a &#x27;flop&#x27; because of its poor US sales. It was withdrawn from the US market in 2006, although a few were still on dealers&#x27; lots in 2007.
==== Pontiac GTO ====

The Pontiac GTO was released in 2004 and was facelifted in 2005. Complaints from American consumers about the Pontiac GTO&#x27;s bland design led to the addition of twin hood scoops in 2005 with the VZ series Monaro to recall the later muscle-car variants of the late 1960s&#x27; models; the hood scoops vent in cool air to the engine bay but do not directly feed the engine. In the eyes of the Australian press, the scoops have spoiled the clean lines of the design, while the American media seemed to accept them. The 2005 and 2006 GTO also received a LS2 6.0 L engine rated at 298 kW (400 hp); the Australian HSV Coupé GTO received a similar engine in its Z series; and Vauxhall launched this as the Monaro VXR in the UK.

The 40,808th GTO built became the last Monaro-based unit built by Holden.
==== Vauxhall Monaro ====
The Monaro was also sold in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Monaro where it won &quot;Top Gear magazine&#x27;s&quot; best muscle car award in 2004.

Vauxhall offered the Monaro buyer a limited edition prior to discontinuation of the model: the VXR 500. A Harrop supercharger was installed onto the standard GM 6.0 L LS2 engine by Vauxhall dealer Greens of Rainham in conjunction with tuning firm Wortec, increasing power to and torque to 677 N·m (500 lbf·ft). In addition to this, a shorter gear linkage was added to enable quicker shifts. The resultant 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) was 4.8 seconds.

With the end of production, Vauxhall opted to replace the Monaro in 2007 with a version of the HSV Clubsport R8 4-door sedan. The new model sports sedan is simply referred to as the Vauxhall VXR8.
== Concept cars ==
=== 1980s VH project ===
The possibility briefly existed in the early 1980s for a revival of the Monaro badge based on a combination of the Holden VH Commodore and the Opel Monza. With serious exploration of the concept, a Monza was shipped to Australia by Peter Brock but the project was shelved as Holden was more preoccupied, at the time, with engineering work to revamp the Statesman and Gemini range as well as with the launch of the JB Camira.

=== 1998 Coupé ===
This concept car, codenamed &quot;Monica&quot;, emerged 20 years after the last Monaro coupé. Publicly displayed at the 1998 Sydney Motor Show, the two-door Coupé was based on the then existing VT-series Holden Commodore, which, in turn, was based on a modified platform of the European Opel Omega B. Journalists quickly christened it the Monaro and orders came flooding in, thus encouraging Holden to produce it. The production model the third generation Monaro, known as the V2 series was eventually launched in 2001, by then based on the Holden VX Commodore.

=== 2002 HRT 427 ===
Displayed at the 2002 Sydney Motor Show, the HRT 427 based on a modified Monaro bodyshell. The MacPherson strut front suspension was replaced by an aluminium double A-arm setup with adjustable dampers and a weight reduction program including a carbon fibre bonnet and magnesium wheels brought the car&#x27;s weight down to just 1575 kg (3472 lb). The name was derived from the engine used, a (7.0-litre) V8 engine from the Corvette C5-R (based on the GM LS7 design), producing at 6,000 rpm. This powerplant was built by Melbourne-based John Sidney Racing, renowned for its success in the Australian Sprintcar and NASCAR series. The transmission used was a custom Tremec T-56 M12 six-speed manual gearbox with a heavy-duty 900 N·m clutch, giving the car a time of 4.4 seconds and a top speed of . Other unique fittings included: AP Racing six-piston racing brakes, ram air induction, Motec instrument panel, two Sparco Pro 2000 seats and a half roll cage.

Originally intended to be put into production as competition against vehicles such as the Porsche 911 GT2, it soon became apparent to Holden that the high specification HRT 427 could not be built in such limited quantities for the original A$215,000 asking price. As a result, the project was eventually cancelled and all customer deposits received were refunded.

The only HRT 427s in existence are two road cars and four racing versions (the latter built by Garry Rogers Motorsport for use in the short-lived Bathurst 24 Hour race and Australian Nations Cup Championship), each of which cost about A$500,000 to build. The road cars had a reported of power and of torque. One of these is not for sale and has remained within Holden&#x27;s concept car collection. In April 2008, the other road car was sold to the Cairns car collector, Shawn Ryan. It has since been inaccurately stated in the media that he paid the record-breaking price of A$920,000, making it the most expensive Australian car ever sold. In reality, however, the quoted price tag was for both an HRT 427 and the first HSV VS GTS-R ever built. The portion of that figure attributable to the HRT 427 is $710,000, which was the amount the then owner received before commission to the sales agent. In June 2010, the concept car was re-sold at auction in Sydney to an anonymous Queensland buyer at the far lower price of A$350,000. The four racing cars have likewise made their way into collections, with their racing careers shortened by regulation changes.

The interest in the HRT 427 was such that, in 2008, its spiritual production version became the HSV W427 sedan built to celebrate HSV&#x27;s 20th anniversary. In addition, in 2004, a more affordable racing coupé version reemerged in the form of the HSV GTS-R.

=== 2004 Convertible ===
The Holden Monaro four-seater convertible, codenamed &quot;Marilyn&quot;, was a fully operational one-off concept car, it was never intended to reach production. It was built in 2002 in left hand drive by TWR Engineering at a reported cost of A$2 million and shown at the 2004 Sydney Motor Show.
=== 2004 HSV GTS-R ===
The HSV GTS-R concept car, codenamed &quot;P120&quot;, was unveiled at the 2004 Sydney Motor Show. Similarities could be drawn with the HRT 427, however, the GTS-R was never intended for road-use but for a one-make racing series. Its more aggressive appearance was achieved through the use of a large front airdam, xenon headlights, LED rear lights, active carbon fiber rear spoiler and rear diffuser. The GTS-R was powered by a modified version of Chevrolet&#x27;s LS2 V8 engine rated at . Other features included carbon ceramic disc brakes, rollcage, side-exiting exhausts and 19-inch ROH alloy wheels. The concept never reached production.

=== 2008 Coupé 60 ===
This VE Commodore-based concept was presented at the Melbourne Motorshow in 2008 to celebrate Holden&#x27;s 60th anniversary. It cost A$2.5 million to build but never reached production.

=== 2013 VF project ===
In 2013, the Australian media became aware of a &quot;VF Monaro&quot; digital rendering posted online by design firm, Dsine International, which also saw the input of Holden designers, Simon Gow and Peter Hughes. It remained only a rendering with no production prospects, thanks to the existence, at that time, of the larger volume selling fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaro, which was based on the same Zeta platform of the VE-VF Commodore.

== Motorsport ==
A pair of Monaro GT racecars powered by an Australian built version of the 427 cu in Corvette C5-R engine was built by Garry Rogers Motorsport (GRM) to compete in the Australian Nations Cup Championship and won the 2002 and 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour races. This car is often confused for being the &#x27;track&#x27; version of the HRT 427, but the racing program headed by then-Holden Motorsport Manager John Stevenson was announced many months before the HRT 427 was revealed to the press and public.

In fact, the first GRM-built car in &#x27;nuclear banana&#x27; yellow underwent shakedown laps at Calder Park before a half day&#x27;s testing at Winton wearing the race number &quot;427&quot;. It was then shown to the media and public at the Bathurst 1000 race a week before the HRT 427 was unveiled at the 2002 Sydney Motor Show. Much to the displeasure of V8 Supercars event organisers, Garth Tander drove a lap of the Mt Panorama circuit in the rain, as part of Holden Motorsport&#x27;s buying track time to promote the &#x27;rival&#x27; 24 Hour race event. So as not to preempt the HRT 427&#x27;s launch the following week, for its sneak Bathurst 1000 unveiling, the yellow Monaro wore the Tander&#x27;s GRM V8 Supercar race number &quot;34&quot; before reverting to &quot;427&quot; for the 24 Hour race.

The HRT 427 won both the first and last races it competed in. Garth Tander, Steven Richards, Cameron McConville and Nathan Pretty drove the car to a debut win in the 2002 Bathurst 24 Hour, while James Brock son of legendary driver Peter Brock drove the third and last 427 Monaro built by GRM to victory in the final race of the 2004 Nations Cup at the Mallala Circuit in South Australia.

<text>Etobicoke Creek is a river in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada. It is a tributary of Lake Ontario and runs from Caledon to southern Etobicoke, part of the City of Toronto. The creek is within the jurisdiction of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Etobicoke&quot; was derived from the Mississauga word &quot;wah-do-be-kang&quot; (&quot;wadoopikaang&quot;), meaning &quot;place where the alders grow&quot;, which was used to describe the area between Etobicoke Creek and the Humber River. The first provincial land surveyor, Augustus Jones, also spelled it as &quot;ato-be-coake&quot;. A letter from January 22, 1775 uses &quot;Tobacock&quot;. Etobicoke was adopted as the official name of the township (later city, now part of the city of Toronto) in 1795 on the direction of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. The name for the waterway used in the Toronto Purchase treaty was Etobicoke River. Simcoe in a memo from April 5, 1796 refers to it as &quot;Smith River or Etobicoke&quot;. In a letter dated April 9, 1796 he used &quot;Tobicoke&quot;. (No reference appears for Smith but could be linked to Samuel Smith who would be granted land in Etobicoke and served with Simcoe in the Queen&#x27;s Rangers.) Both &quot;creek&quot; and &quot;river&quot; appear in newspapers and books until about 1960. &quot;Creek&quot; was officially adopted by the Geographical Names Board of Canada on November 18, 1962, though it existed far earlier.

The name of the river in Anishinaabemowin (Ojibwe) language of the Mississaugas, in modern Fiero orthography is &quot;Edoopikaag-ziibi&quot;.

==Course==

Etobicoke Creek begins south of the Oak Ridges Moraine and flows through Caledon, Brampton, and Mississauga — west of the Toronto Pearson International Airport and the surrounding industrial area — to its mouth at Lake Ontario in the Etobicoke portion of the city of Toronto. The length of the creek is .

==Watershed==
The creek&#x27;s southern section forms a city and county-level boundary, separating Toronto on the east from Mississauga, in Peel Region, as far north as Eglinton Avenue (north of where it flows entirely through Peel), on the west. The watershed encompasses . Mean summer waterflow has increased over the period 1967 to 2006 from 3.5 m3/s to 5.0 m3/s (4.5 cu. yd. to 6.5 cu. yd.) as recorded at a measuring station near the river mouth at the Queen Elizabeth Way.

The creek ends in a large recreational area, Marie Curtis Park. It is surrounded by cliffs and the bottom is solid stone, often covered with smaller rocks. It is full of small fish and crayfish, a sign of purity of water.

==Geology==
The creek is characterized by winding paths ravines and shale banks.

==Incidents==
===Aircraft accidents===
A section of Etobicoke Creek runs close to Toronto&#x27;s Pearson International Airport, leaving a ravine very close to the west ends of runways 24L and 24R or the beginnings of Runways 6R &amp; 6L. There have been two major aircraft incidents which have resulted in aircraft in the ravine.

*On 26 June 1978, an Air Canada Douglas DC-9-32, Flight 189, with 107 people on board, overshot runway 24R and crashed into the ravine, destroying the aircraft and killing two of the passengers.
*On August 2, 2005, an Air France Airbus A340-300, Flight 358, with 309 people on board, overran runway 24L into the ravine, followed by a fire on board. All people on board escaped safely but dozens were injured. One passenger, Roel Bramar, later commented, &quot;It was a hell of a roller coaster going into the ravine.&quot; Although it was widely reported the Air France plane landed in a heavily wooded area, the area is in fact is fairly wide open, due to airport maintenance of both sides of the ravine. The west side of the ravine is a gentle slope, with grass and the airport&#x27;s light towers for both 6R and 6L. The fact that all on board the aircraft survived led to the incident quickly being referred to as the &#x27;Miracle of Toronto&#x27; by press outlets.

The position of the ravine so close to the airport&#x27;s overrun area has raised some concerns among the general public, despite Toronto Pearson&#x27;s compliance with all safety regulations.

===Spills===

On March 24, 2020, approximately 400 litres of red ink spilled onto Etobicoke Creek, causing it to turn red.

==Neighbourhoods==
* Markland Wood is bounded by Etobicoke Creek to the west and Elmcrest (tributary) Creek to the east.
* Alderwood is bounded by Etobicoke Creek to the west.
* Long Branch is bounded on the west by Etobicoke Creek.

==Tributaries==
* Spring Creek - begins from Etobicoke Creek northwest of the airport northwards between Torbram and Kennedy Roads, to about Bovaird Drive.
* Little Etobicoke Creek
* Elmcrest Creek - small tributary that begins from two ponds inside Etobicoke Centennial Park and flows into Etobicoke Creek in the south at the Markland Wood Golf Club.

Another tributary called Silver Creek was buried during the construction of Malton Airport, which has since become Toronto Pearson International Airport.

<doc id="643758" wikidata="Q57365" url="?curid=643758" title="Rudolf Caracciola">
<text>Otto Wilhelm Rudolf Caracciola (30 January 1901 – 28 September 1959) was a German racing driver. He won the European Drivers&#x27; Championship, the pre-1950 equivalent of the modern Formula One World Championship, an unsurpassed three times. He also won the European Hillclimbing Championship three times – twice in sports cars, and once in Grand Prix cars. Caracciola raced for Mercedes-Benz during their original dominating Silver Arrows period, named after the silver colour of the cars, and set speed records for the firm. He was affectionately dubbed &quot;Caratsch&quot; by the German public, and was known by the title of &quot;Regenmeister&quot;, or &quot;Rainmaster&quot;, for his prowess in wet conditions.

Caracciola began racing while he was working as apprentice at the Fafnir automobile factory in Aachen during the early 1920s, first on motorcycles and then in cars. Racing for Mercedes-Benz, he won his first two Hillclimbing Championships in 1930 and 1931, and moved to Alfa Romeo for 1932, where he won the Hillclimbing Championship for the third time. In 1933, he established the privateer team Scuderia C.C. with his fellow driver Louis Chiron, but a crash in practice for the Monaco Grand Prix left him with multiple fractures of his right thigh, which ruled him out of racing for more than a year. He returned to the newly reformed Mercedes-Benz racing team in 1934, with whom he won three European Championships, in 1935, 1937 and 1938. Like most German racing drivers in the 1930s, Caracciola was a member of the Nazi paramilitary group National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), but never a member of the Nazi Party. He returned to racing after the Second World War, but crashed in qualifying for the 1946 Indianapolis 500. A second comeback in 1952 was halted by another crash, in a sports car race in Switzerland.

After he retired, Caracciola worked as a Mercedes-Benz salesman targeting North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troops stationed in Europe. He died in the German city of Kassel, after suffering liver failure. He was buried in Switzerland, where he had lived since the early 1930s. He is remembered as one of the greatest pre-1939 Grand Prix drivers, a perfectionist who excelled in all conditions. His record of six German Grand Prix wins remains unbeaten.

== Early life and career ==

Caracciola was born in Remagen, Germany, just south of Bonn on 30 January 1901. He was the fourth child of Maximilian and Mathilde, who ran the Hotel Fürstenberg. His ancestors had migrated during the Thirty Years&#x27; War from Naples to the German Rhineland, where Prince Bartolomeo Caracciolo (nephew of Spanish-allegiance Field Marshal Tommaso Caracciolo) had commanded the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress near Koblenz. 

Caracciola was interested in cars from a young age, and from his fourteenth birthday wanted to become a racing driver. He drove an early Mercedes during the First World War, and gained his driver&#x27;s license before the legal age of 18. After Caracciola&#x27;s graduation from school soon after the war, his father wanted him to attend university, but when he died Caracciola instead became an apprentice in the Fafnir automobile factory in Aachen.

Motorsport in Germany at the time, as in the rest of Europe, was an exclusive sport, mainly limited to the upper classes. As the sport became more professional in the early 1920s, specialist drivers, like Caracciola, began to dominate. Caracciola enjoyed his first success in motorsport while working for Fafnir, taking his NSU motorcycle to several victories in endurance events. When Fafnir decided to take part in the first race at the Automobil-Verkehrs- und Übungs-Straße (AVUS) track in 1922, Caracciola drove one of the works cars to fourth overall, the first in his class and the quickest Fafnir. He followed this with victory in a race at the Opelbahn in Rüsselsheim. He did not stay long in Aachen, however; in 1923, after punching a soldier from the occupying Belgian Army in a nightclub, he fled the city. He moved to Dresden, where he continued to work as a Fafnir representative. In April of that year, Caracciola won the 1923 ADAC race at the Berlin Stadium in a borrowed Ego 4 hp. In his autobiography, Caracciola said he only ever sold one car for Fafnir, but due to inflation by &quot;the time the car was delivered the money was just enough to pay for the horn and two headlights&quot;.

Later in 1923, he was hired by the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft as a car salesman at their Dresden outlet. Caracciola continued racing, driving a Mercedes 6/25/40 hp to victory in four of the eight races he entered in 1923. His success continued in 1924 with the new supercharged Mercedes 1.5-litre; he won 15 races during the season, including the Klausenpass hillclimb in Switzerland. He attended the Italian Grand Prix at Monza as a reserve driver for Mercedes, but did not take part in the race. He drove his 1.5-litre to five victories in 1925, and won the hillclimbs at Kniebis and Freiburg in a Mercedes 24/100/140 hp. With his racing career becoming increasingly successful, he abandoned his plans to study mechanical engineering.

== 1926–1930: Breakthrough ==

Caracciola&#x27;s breakthrough year was in 1926. The inaugural German Grand Prix was held at the AVUS track on 11 July, but the date clashed with a more prestigious race in Spain. The newly merged company Mercedes-Benz, conscious of export considerations, chose the latter race to run their main team. Hearing this, Caracciola took a short leave from his job and went to the Mercedes office in Stuttgart to ask for a car. Mercedes agreed to lend Caracciola and Adolf Rosenberger two 1923 2-litre M218s, provided they enter not as works drivers but independents. Rosenberger started well in front of the 230,000 spectators, but Caracciola stalled his engine. His riding mechanic, Eugen Salzer, jumped out and pushed the car to get it started, but by the time they began moving they had lost more than a minute to the leaders. It started to rain, and Caracciola passed many cars that had retired in the poor conditions. Rosenberger lost control at the North Curve on the eighth lap when trying to pass a slower car, and crashed into the timekeepers&#x27; box, killing all three occupants; Caracciola kept driving. In the fog and rain, he had no idea which position he was in, but resolved to keep driving so he could at least finish the race. When he finished the 20th and final lap, he was surprised to find that he had won the race. The German press dubbed him &quot;Regenmeister&quot;, or &quot;Rainmaster&quot;, for his prowess in the wet conditions.

Caracciola used the prize money——to set up a Mercedes-Benz dealership on the prestigious Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. He also married his girlfriend, Charlotte, whom he had met in 1923 while working at the Mercedes-Benz outlet in Dresden. He continued racing in domestic competitions, returning again to Freiburg to compete in the Flying Kilometre race where he set a new sports car record in the new Mercedes-Benz 2-litre Model K, and finished first. Caracciola entered the Klausenpass hillclimb and set a new touring car record; he also won the touring car class at the Semmering hillclimb before driving a newly supercharged 1914 Mercedes Grand Prix car over the same route to set the fastest time of the day for any class. The recently completed Nürburgring was the host of the 1927 Eifelrennen, a race which had been held on public roads in the Eifel mountains since 1922. Caracciola won the first race on the track, and returned to the Nürburgring a month later for the 1927 German Grand Prix, but his car broke down and the race was won by Otto Merz. However, he won 11 competitions in 1927, almost all of them in the Ferdinand Porsche-developed Mercedes-Benz Model S.

Caracciola regained his German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, who took over Caracciola&#x27;s car when the latter collapsed with heat exhaustion at a pit stop. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by half a second.

The inaugural Monaco Grand Prix was held on 14 April 1929. Caracciola, driving a 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SSK, started from the back row of the grid (which was allocated randomly), and battled Bugatti driver William Grover-Williams for the lead early on. However, his pit stop, which took four and a half minutes to refill his car with petrol, left him unable to recover the time, and he eventually finished third. He won the RAC Tourist Trophy in slippery conditions, and confirmed his reputation as a specialist in wet track racing. He partnered Werner in the Mille Miglia and Le Mans endurance races in 1930; they finished sixth in the former but were forced to retire after leading for most of the race in the latter after their car&#x27;s generator burnt out. Caracciola took victory in the 1930 Irish Grand Prix at Phoenix Park, and won four hillclimbs to take the title of European Hillclimb Champion for the first time. However, he was forced to close his dealership in Berlin after the firm went bankrupt.

== 1931–1932: Move to Alfa Romeo ==

Mercedes-Benz officially withdrew from motor racing in 1931—citing the global economic downturn as a reason for their decision—although they continued to support Caracciola and a few other drivers covertly, retaining manager Alfred Neubauer to run the &#x27;independent&#x27; operation. In part because of the financial situation, Caracciola was the only Mercedes driver to appear at the 1931 Monaco Grand Prix, driving an SSKL (a lighter version of the SSK). Caracciola and Maserati driver Luigi Fagioli challenged the Bugattis of Louis Chiron and Achille Varzi for the lead early in the race, but when the SSKL&#x27;s clutch failed Caracciola withdrew from the race. A crowd of 100,000 turned out for the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. Rain began to fall before the race, and continued as Caracciola chased Fagioli for the lead in the early laps. The spray from Fagioli&#x27;s Maserati severely impaired Caracciola&#x27;s vision, but he was able to pass to take the lead at the Schwalbenschwanz corner. The track began to dry on lap six, and Chiron&#x27;s Bugatti, which was by then running second, began to catch the heavier Mercedes. Caracciola&#x27;s pit stop, completed in record time, kept him ahead of Chiron, and despite the Bugatti lapping 15 seconds faster than the Mercedes late in the race, Caracciola won by more than one minute.

Caracciola was lucky to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, bringing it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch at the side of the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola in his SSKL was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955, also in a Mercedes-made car.

Mercedes-Benz withdrew entirely from motor racing at the start of 1932 in the face of the economic crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm&#x27;s Italian drivers did not believe he could adjust smoothly from the big Mercedes cars to the smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, &quot;I can still see the expression on [Alfa Romeo driver Giuseppe] Campari&#x27;s face when I arrived back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn&#x27;t I tell you that one wasn&#x27;t going to make it?&quot;

The next race was the Monaco Grand Prix, where Caracciola was again entered as a semi-independent. He ran fourth early in the race, but moved to second as Alfa Romeo driver Baconin Borzacchini pitted for a wheel change and the axle on Achille Varzi&#x27;s Bugatti broke. Tazio Nuvolari, in the other Alfa Romeo, found his lead reduced rapidly as Caracciola closed in; with ten laps remaining in the race Caracciola was so close he could see Nuvolari changing gears. He finished the race just behind Nuvolari. The crowd jeered Caracciola: they believed he had deliberately lost for the team, denying them a fight for the win. However, on the strength of his performance, Caracciola was offered a full spot on the Alfa Romeo team, which he accepted.

Alfa Romeo dominated the rest of the Grand Prix season. Nuvolari and Campari drove the light and newly introduced Alfa Romeo P3 at the Italian Grand Prix, while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retire when his car broke down, but he took over Borzacchini&#x27;s car when the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the French Grand Prix, Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo&#x27;s dominance was so great and their cars were so far ahead the team could choose the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the 1932 German Grand Prix, where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.

Caracciola performed strongly in other races; he won the Polish and Monza Grands Prix and the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, and took five more hill climbs to win that Championship for the third and final time. He was, however, beaten by the Mercedes-Benz of Manfred von Brauchitsch at the Avusrennen (the yearly race at the AVUS track). Von Brauchitsch drove a privately entered SSK with streamlined bodywork and beat Caracciola&#x27;s Alfa Romeo, which finished in second place. Caracciola was seen by the German crowd as having defected to the Italian team and was booed, while von Brauchitsch&#x27;s all-German victory drew mass support.

== 1933–1934: Injury and return for Mercedes ==

Alfa Romeo withdrew its factory team from motor racing at the start of the 1933 season, leaving Caracciola without a contract. He was close friends with the French-Monegasque driver Louis Chiron, who had been fired from Bugatti, and while on vacation in Arosa in Switzerland the two decided to form their own team, Scuderia C.C. (Caracciola-Chiron). They bought three Alfa Romeo 8Cs (known as Monzas), and Daimler-Benz provided a truck to transport them. Chiron&#x27;s car was painted blue with a white stripe, and Caracciola&#x27;s white with a blue stripe. The new team&#x27;s first race was at the Monaco Grand Prix. On the second day of practice for the race, while Caracciola was showing Chiron around the circuit (it was Chiron&#x27;s first time in an Alfa Romeo), the German lost control heading into the Tabac corner. Three of the four brakes failed, which destabilised the car. Faced with diving into the sea or smashing into the wall, Caracciola instinctively chose the latter. Caracciola later recounted what happened after the impact:

Caracciola was carried on a chair to the local tobacco shop, and from there he went to the hospital. He had sustained multiple fractures of his right thigh, and his doctors doubted he would race again. He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his doctors and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.

The rise to power of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an opportunity to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis&#x27; rise to power, both companies spent the better part of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas&#x27; chalet in Lugano in November with a plan to sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.

Upon his return to Lugano, another tragedy befell him. In February, Charlotte died when the party she was skiing with in the Swiss Alps was hit by an avalanche. Caracciola withdrew almost entirely from public life while he mourned, almost deciding to retire completely from motor racing. A visit from Chiron encouraged him to return to racing, and despite his initial reservations he was persuaded to drive the lap of honour before the 1934 Monaco Grand Prix. Although his leg still ached while he drove, the experience convinced him to return to racing.

Caracciola tested the new Mercedes-Benz W25 at the AVUS track in April, and despite his injuries—his right leg had healed five  shorter than his left, leaving him with a noticeable limp—he was cleared to race. However, Neubauer withdrew the Mercedes team from their first race, also at the AVUS track, as their practice times compared too unfavourably to Auto Union&#x27;s. Caracciola was judged not fit to race for the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, but made the start for the German Grand Prix at the same track six weeks later. He took the lead from Auto Union driver Hans Stuck on the outside of the Karussel on the 13th lap, but retired a lap later when his engine failed. He had better luck at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix in September. In very hot weather, Caracciola started from fourth and moved to second, where he trailed Stuck. After 59 laps, the pain in his leg overwhelmed him, and he pitted, letting teammate Fagioli take over his car. Fagioli won from Stuck&#x27;s car which by then had been taken over by Nuvolari. His best results in the rest of the season were a second place in the Spanish Grand Prix—he led before Fagioli passed him, much to the anger of Neubauer, who had ordered the Italian to hold position—and first at the Klausenpass hillclimb.

== 1935–1936: First Championship and rivalry with Rosemeyer ==

Caracciola took the first of his three European Drivers&#x27; Championships in 1935. Seven Grands Prix—the Monaco, French, Belgian, German, Swiss, Italian and Spanish—would be included for Championship consideration. He opened the Championship season with a pole in Monaco but he retired just after the half of the race, then he won in France and took the lead of the standings with another win in Belgium, ahead of Fagioli and von Brauchitsch, who shared the other Mercedes-Benz W25. Nuvolari won a surprise victory at the Nürburgring in his Alfa Romeo P3, ahead of Stuck and Caracciola. The Swiss Grand Prix was held at the Bremgarten Circuit in Bern, and Caracciola won from Fagioli and the new Auto Union star Bernd Rosemeyer. Caracciola won the Spanish Grand Prix from Fagioli and von Brauchitsch; although his transmission failed at the Italian Grand Prix and he was forced to retire, his four wins allowed him to take the Championship.

In the other races of the 1935 season, Caracciola won the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring and finished second at the Penya Rhin Grand Prix in Barcelona. He also won the Tripoli Grand Prix, organised by the Libyan Governor-General Italo Balbo. The Grand Prix was held in the desert, around a salt lake, and because of the intense heat Neubauer was concerned that the tyres on the Mercedes-Benz cars would not last. Caracciola started poorly, but moved to third, after four pit stops to change tyres, by lap 30 of 40. He inherited the lead from Nuvolari and Varzi when the two Italians pitted, and held it to the finish, despite a late charge from Varzi. Caracciola later wrote that this was the race where he began to feel he had recovered from his crash in Monaco two years before, and he was now back among the contenders.

Remaining in such a position would require Mercedes-Benz to produce a competitive car for the 1936 season. Although the chassis of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74 litres, the car proved inferior to the Type C developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved the chassis to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened the season with a win in the rain at the Monaco Grand Prix, after starting from third position. He led the Hungarian Grand Prix early but retired with mechanical problems. At the German Grand Prix, he retired with a failed fuel pump, before taking over his teammate Hermann Lang&#x27;s car; he later retired that car with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the Swiss Grand Prix for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the Clerk of the Course ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola&#x27;s later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and Tunis—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.

== 1937: Second Championship ==

Mercedes-Benz returned to Grand Prix racing at the start of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre straight-8 engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500- an incredible output for the time, and this figure would not be surpassed in Grand Prix racing until the early 1980s, and would also not be surpassed in any form of racing until Can-Am racing in the late 1960s. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000 people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes&#x27; new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup, sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (AAA) in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. After starting from pole position, Caracciola led until lap ten, when he retired with a broken supercharger.

Caracciola started from the second row of the grid at the German Grand Prix, but was into the lead soon after the start. There he remained to the finish, in front of von Brauchitsch and Rosemeyer. He took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix three weeks later, and was soon engaged in a hard fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola&#x27;s induction system during a pit stop, costing him three and a half minutes. Caracciola won his second race of the season at the Swiss Grand Prix. Despite heavy rain which made the Bremgarten Circuit slippery and hazardous, Caracciola set a new lap record, at an average speed of , and cemented his reputation as the &quot;Regenmeister&quot;.

For the first time, the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Livorno Circuit rather than the traditional venue of Monza. Caracciola took pole position, and despite two false starts caused by spectators pouring onto the track, held his lead for the majority of the race and won from his teammate Lang by just 0.4 seconds. In doing so Caracciola clinched the European Championship for the second time. He backed up the win with another at the Masaryk Grand Prix two weeks later. He trailed Rosemeyer for much of the race until the Auto Union skidded against a kerb and allowed the Mercedes into the lead.

Caracciola married for the second time in 1937, to Alice Hoffman-Trobeck, who worked as a timekeeper for Mercedes-Benz. He had met her in 1932, when she was having an affair with Chiron. She was, at that time, married to Alfred Hoffman-Trobeck, a Swiss businessman and heir to a pharmaceutical empire. She had taken care of Caracciola after Charlotte died, and shortly after began an affair with him, unbeknownst to Chiron. They were married in June in Lugano, just before the trip to America.

== 1938: Speed records and third Championship ==

On 28 January 1938, Caracciola and the Mercedes-Benz record team appeared on the Reichs-Autobahn A5 between Frankfurt and Darmstadt, in an attempt to break numerous speed records set by the Auto Union team. The system of speed records at the time used classes based on engine capacity, allowing modified Grand Prix cars, in this case a W125, to be used to break records. Caracciola had broken previous records—he reached in 1935—but these had been superseded by Auto Union drivers, first Stuck and then Rosemeyer. Driving a Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen, essentially a W125 with streamlined bodywork and a larger engine, Caracciola set a new average speed of for the flying kilometre and for the flying mile, speeds which remain to this day as some of the fastest ever achieved on public roads. The day ended in tragedy however; Rosemeyer set off in his Auto Union in an attempt to break Caracciola&#x27;s new records, but his car was struck by a violent gust of wind while he was travelling at around , hurling the car off the road, where it rolled twice, killing its driver. Rosemeyer&#x27;s death had a profound effect on Caracciola, as he later wrote:

The Grand Prix formula was changed again in 1938, abandoning the previous system of weight restrictions and instead limiting piston displacement. Mercedes-Benz&#x27; new car, the W154, proved its abilities at the French Grand Prix, where von Brauchitsch won ahead of Caracciola and Lang to make it a Mercedes 1–2–3. Caracciola won two races in the 1938 season: the Swiss Grand Prix and the Coppa Acerbo; finished second in three: the French, German and Pau Grands Prix; and third in two: the Tripoli and Italian Grands Prix, to take the European Championship for the third and final time. The highlight of Caracciola&#x27;s season was his win in the pouring rain at the Swiss Grand Prix. His teammate Seaman led for the first 11 laps before Caracciola passed him; he remained in the lead for the rest of the race, despite losing the visor on his helmet, severely reducing visibility, especially given the spray thrown up by the tyres of the many lapped cars.

== 1939: Claims of favouritism towards Lang ==

The 1939 season took place under the looming shadow of the coming Second World War, and the schedule was only halted with the invasion of Poland in September. The Championship season began with the Belgian Grand Prix in June. In heavy rain, Caracciola spun at La Source, got out and pushed his car off into the safety of the trees. Later in the race, Seaman left the track at the same corner, his car bursting into flames upon impact with the trees, where he was burnt alive in the cockpit. He died that night in hospital, after briefly regaining consciousness. The entire Mercedes team travelled to London for his burial. In the rest of the season, Caracciola won the German Grand Prix for the sixth and final time, again in the rain, after starting third on the grid. He finished second behind Lang at the Swiss and Tripoli Grands Prix. The latter race was seen as a major win for Mercedes-Benz. In an effort to halt German dominance at the event, the Italian organisers decided to limit engine sizes to 1.5 litres (the German teams at the time ran 3-litre engines), and announced the change at the last moment. The change was, however, leaked to Mercedes-Benz well in advance, and in just eight months the firm developed and built two W165s under the new restrictions; both of them beat the combined might of 28 Italian cars, much to the disappointment of the organisers. Caracciola believed that the Mercedes-Benz team were favouring Lang during the 1939 season; in a letter sent to Mercedes&#x27; brand owner Daimler-Benz CEO Dr. Wilhelm Kissel, he wrote:

Despite Caracciola&#x27;s protests, Lang was declared the 1939 European Champion by the NSKK (&quot;Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps&quot;, or National Socialist Motor Corps)—although this was never ratified by the AIACR, and Auto Union driver Hermann Paul Müller may have a valid claim to the title under the official scoring system—and motor racing was put on hold upon the outbreak of war.

== War, comeback and later years ==

Caracciola and his wife Alice returned to their home in Lugano. For the duration of the war, he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they returned to the Bologna clinic to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of the last part of the war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. When they finally arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.

He was invited to participate in the 1946 Indianapolis 500, and originally intended to drive one of the W165s, but was unable to have them released in time by Swiss customs. Nevertheless, he headed to the United States to watch the race. Joel Thorne, a local team owner, offered him one of his Thorne Engineering Specials to drive, but during a practice session before the race Caracciola suffered his second major accident when was hit on the head by an object, believed to be a bird, and crashed into the south wall. His life was saved by a tank driver&#x27;s helmet the organisers insisted he wear. He suffered a severe concussion and was in a coma for several days. Tony Hulman, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, invited Caracciola and his wife to stay at his lodge near Terre Haute to let him fully recover.

Caracciola returned to racing in 1952, when he was recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling finished second in the race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps because of a lack of time to prepare for the race. Caracciola&#x27;s career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree at the fast, tree-lined Bremgarten circuit, fracturing his left leg.

After he retired from racing, Caracciola continued to work for Daimler-Benz as a salesman, targeting NATO troops stationed in Europe. He organised shows and demonstrations which toured military bases, leading in part to an increase in Mercedes-Benz sales during that period. In early 1959, he became sick and developed signs of jaundice, which worsened despite treatment. Later in the year, he was diagnosed with advanced cirrhosis. On 28 September 1959, in Kassel, Germany, he suffered liver failure and died, aged 58. He was buried in his home town of Lugano.

== Nazi interactions ==

Caracciola first met Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party, in 1931. Hitler had ordered a Mercedes-Benz 770, at that point Mercedes&#x27; most expensive car, but due to the amount of time spent upgrading the car in line with the Nazi leader&#x27;s wishes, the delivery was late. To mollify Hitler&#x27;s anger, Caracciola was dispatched by Mercedes to deliver the car to the Brown House in Munich. Caracciola drove Hitler and his niece Geli Raubal around Munich to demonstrate the car. He later wrote (after the fall of the Nazi Party) that he was not particularly awed by Hitler: &quot;I could not imagine that this man would have the requirements for taking over the government someday.&quot;

As were most German racing drivers in Nazi Germany, Caracciola was a member of the NSKK, a paramilitary organisation of the Nazi Party devoted to motor racing and motor cars; during the Second World War it handled transport and supply. In reports on races by German media Caracciola was referred to as NSKK-&quot;Staffelführer&quot; Caracciola, the equivalent of a Squadron Leader. After races in Germany the drivers took part in presentations to the crowd coordinated by NSKK leader Adolf Hühnlein and attended by senior Nazis. Although he wrote after the fall of the Nazi regime that he found such presentations dull and uninspiring, Caracciola occasionally used his position as a famous racing driver to publicly support the Nazi regime; for example, in 1938, while supporting the Nazi platform at the Reichstag elections, he said, &quot;[t]he unique successes of these new racing cars in the past four years are a victorious symbol of our &quot;Führer&quot;&#x27;s (Hitler&#x27;s) achievement in rebuilding the nation.&quot;

Despite this, when Caracciola socialised with the upper Nazi echelons he did so merely as an &quot;accessory&quot;, not as an active member, and at no time was he a member of the Nazi Party. According to his autobiography, he turned down a request from the NSKK in 1942 to entertain German troops, as he &quot;could not find it in myself to cheer up young men so that they would believe in a victory I myself could not believe in&quot;. Caracciola lived in Switzerland from the early 1930s, and despite strict currency controls, his salary was paid in Swiss francs. During the war, he continued to receive a pension from Daimler-Benz, until the firm ceased his payments under pressure from the Nazi party in 1942.

== Legacy ==

Caracciola is remembered—along with Nuvolari and Rosemeyer—as one of the greatest pre-1939 Grand Prix drivers. He has a reputation as a perfectionist, who very rarely had accidents or caused mechanical failures in his cars, and who could deliver when needed regardless of the conditions. His relationship with Mercedes racing manager Alfred Neubauer, one of mutual respect, is often cited as a contributing factor to his success. After Caracciola&#x27;s death, Neubauer described him as:

His trophy collection was donated to the Indianapolis Hall of Fame Museum, and he was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2001, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, a monument to Caracciola was erected in his birth town of Remagen, and on the 50th anniversary of his death in 2009 Caracciola Square was dedicated off of the town&#x27;s Rheinpromenade. Karussel corner at the Nürburgring was renamed after him, officially becoming the Caracciola Karussel. , Caracciola&#x27;s record of six German Grand Prix victories remains unbeaten.

During the inaugural official meeting of the 200 Mile Per Hour Club on 2 September 1953, Caracciola was inducted as one of the original three foreigners who met the club&#x27;s requirements of achieving an average of over 200 mph over two runs for his past achievements prior to the club&#x27;s foundation.

<text>Dorothea Antoinette &quot;Dori&quot; Seda (22 June 1951 – February 25, 1988) was an artist best known for her underground comix work in the 1980s. She occasionally used the pen name &quot;Sylvia Silicosis.&quot; Her comics combined exaggerated fantasy and ribald humor with documentation of her life in the Mission District of San Francisco, California.

== Career ==

=== Fine Arts ===
Seda was originally a painter and ceramics artist, graduating from Illinois State University with a B.A. in art. Seda emphasized that she was primarily invested in &quot;pure&quot; art forms, having business cards printed to read, &quot;Dori Seda--ARTIST--San Francisco.&quot; Seda was creating a lot of fine arts content in 1979 and 1980. Some of her notable art works include &quot;Punch Bowl (with cups and ladle), The Wreck in Heaven, Vibrator with 3 Attachments&quot; for ceramics and &quot;Jaded Fish&quot; and &quot;The Vampire Painting&quot; for acrylic on canvas.

=== Comics ===
To pursue her interest in comics, Seda took a job as a janitor at the San Francisco publisher Last Gasp, and soon after became a bookkeeper there. (This work was primarily viewed as a financial necessity to Seda, her true passion being the &quot;pure arts.&quot;) Seda worked exclusively night hours and was known as &quot;The Vampire Bookkeeper.&quot; 

Her first published comics work was a strip titled &quot;Bloods in Space&quot;, written by Kevin Lambert, which appeared in Robert Crumb&#x27;s anthology magazine &quot;Weirdo&quot;, issue #2, in 1981. Seda&#x27;s comic work was centered around taboo sexual subject matters, including swinging and bestiality. Her work intended to push boundaries that individuals upheld as communal prejudices. The reaction of Seda&#x27;s audience is &quot;less an affirmation of community standards than a kind of self-righteous consumerism.&quot; She submitted her work under the pen name &quot;David Seda&quot; but was published in the magazine under her true name. She was subsequently published in &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Comic Book&quot;, &quot;Viper&quot;, &quot;Yellow Silk&quot;, &quot;Prime Cuts&quot;, &quot;Cannibal Romance&quot;, &quot;Weird Smut Comix&quot;, &quot;Tits &amp; Clits&quot;, &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot;, and her solo book &quot;Lonely Nights Comics&quot; (which was banned in England upon its release). 

In 1999, her work was collected in the book &quot;Dori Stories&quot;, which also includes memorial tributes. This body of work almost was not published due to legal troubles regarding the reproduction of Seda&#x27;s work. Ultimately, &quot;Dori Stories&quot; won a 2000 Firecracker Alternative Book Award in the Special Recognition/Wildcard Category &quot;Books about Gap-Toothed Deceased Female Cartoonists with Smelly Dogs&quot;.

In 1988, Last Gasp established the Dori Seda Memorial Award for Women. The first recipient was Carol Tyler.

=== Film ===
Seda was featured in the short documentary &quot;Gap-Toothed Women&quot; by Les Blank, a tribute to women with the commonality of a gap between their two front teeth. Seda was originally cut from the film, as her interview answers were seen as bland, so Seda requested that she be given a second chance and preplanned a response that would gain greater reaction. Seda explained how she was not inherently &quot;valuable&quot; because she was not beautiful because of her &quot;funny teeth.&quot; She attributed her value to the work she had done in spite of her gap saying, she was &quot;kind of glad that [her] teeth are like this, because if I had nice straight teeth, I might never have done anything.” She created a poster for the film.

== Death and copyright issues ==
Seda died at age 37 from respiratory failure after catching the flu during a severe outbreak in San Francisco in the spring of 1988. Her lungs were weakened by silicosis contracted from the toxic fumes released by firing metallic glazes, while neglecting to wear a protective mask for her ceramics work. She was also a heavy smoker who suffered from emphysema which contributed to the deterioration of her health.

After Seda&#x27;s death, conflict arose over the rights to reproduce her work. Friends of Seda wanted to collect and publish the collection that became &quot;Dori Stories&quot;, but at her death, Seda&#x27;s estate passed to the next of kin, her mother. Due to the sexual nature of Seda&#x27;s work, her mother did not wish to see Seda&#x27;s writing in print again and refused requests to publish it. However, a year prior to her death, Seda had written a will that gave partner Don Donahue (also involved in the comics industry) full ownership of her work if she died. The will was written in a humorous tone, opening with the statement, &quot;This is sort of a contract and sort of a will (although I don&#x27;t plan on dying soon.)&quot; Regardless, this document held the legal power of a written contract and allowed for Seda&#x27;s full body of work to be published. The will was witnessed and signed by Seda, Donohue, and fellow cartoonists Krystine Kryttre and Dan O&#x27;Neill. Seda&#x27;s friends successfully filed the will in 1991, conferring full ownership of her work on Donohue.

== In Popular Culture ==
* Dori Seda is a character in the short story &quot;Dori Bangs&quot; by Bruce Sterling in which Sterling imagines what would have happened if Dori hadn&#x27;t died young and had instead met the writer Lester Bangs.

<text>The long-tailed glossy starling (Lamprotornis caudatus) is a member of the starling family of birds. It is a resident breeder in tropical Africa from Senegal east to Sudan.

This common passerine is typically found in open woodland and cultivation. The long-tailed glossy starling builds a nest in a hole. The normal clutch is two to four eggs.

This ubiquitous bird is gregarious and noisy, with a harsh grating call.

The adults of these long birds have metallic green upperparts, violet underparts and a long purple tail. The face is black with a yellow eye. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller, with a brownish tone to the plumage.

Like most starlings, the long-tailed glossy starling is an omnivore, eating fruit and insects.

<text>Aloysius Harry Simmons (born Alois Szymanski; May 22, 1902 – May 26, 1956) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Nicknamed &quot;Bucketfoot Al&quot;, he had his best years with Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics during the late 1920s and early 1930s, winning two World Series with the team. Simmons also played for the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, Washington Senators, Boston Bees, Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox. After his playing career ended, Simmons served as a coach for the Athletics and Cleveland Indians. A career .334 hitter, Simmons was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953.

==Early life==
Simmons was born in Milwaukee and grew up as a fan of the Philadelphia Athletics. In the fourth grade, he received a spanking from his father for insisting that he wanted to play professional baseball. When he persisted in asserting his desire to be a baseball player, his father replied that he had better become a good player. Simmons was known by his birth surname (Szymanski), until he was playing for a local minor league team and he was tired of hearing people mispronounce it. He saw an advertisement for a company named Simmons Hardware and decided to take on the last name of Simmons.

==Playing career==

===Philadelphia Athletics (1924–1932)===
In 1925, his second season with Philadelphia, Simmons led the AL with 253 hits and 392 total bases, while posting a .387 batting average, 24 home runs and 129 runs batted in (RBI). He scored 122 runs, hit 43 doubles, and finished with a .599 slugging percentage. Simmons&#x27; 85 multi-hit games constitute a single-season MLB record. He earned the second-most votes for the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award. In the following three seasons, he hit .341, .392 and .351 and drove in 110, 108 and 107 runs in those respective years, while finishing fifth in 1926 MVP voting and fourth in 1927.

Simmons led the A&#x27;s to the AL pennant in 1929, as Philadelphia went 104–46, finishing 18 games ahead of the New York Yankees. The A&#x27;s went on to defeat the Chicago Cubs in five games to win the World Series. That season, he hit .365 with 34 home runs and led the AL with 157 RBI. He also scored 114 runs, had 212 hits with 41 doubles and a .642 slugging percentage. In the 1929 World Series, Simmons batted .300 with two home runs, five RBIs and scored six runs.

Simmons&#x27; best year as a player was in 1930, when he won his first of successive batting titles, hitting .381 with 36 home runs, 211 hits, 41 doubles and 16 triples. He had a slugging percentage of .708, drove in 165 runs and scored 152 runs in 138 games. The A&#x27;s won the AL pennant again, going 102–52, and defeated the St. Louis Cardinals to win back-to-back World Series titles. In the 1930 World Series, Simmons batted .364 with two home runs and four RBI with a .727 slugging percentage.

In 1931, the A&#x27;s won their third straight AL pennant, by 13.5 games over the Yankees, going 107–45. Simmons won his second batting title, hitting .390 with 22 home runs, 128 RBI, 100 runs scored, 200 hits, 37 doubles, 13 triples and a .641 slugging percentage while playing in only 128 games. He finished third in AL MVP voting behind his MVP teammate Lefty Grove and the Yankees&#x27; Lou Gehrig. The A&#x27;s were upset in their quest for a third consecutive World Series title, losing the 1931 World Series in seven games to the Cardinals. Simmons hit .333 with two home runs and eight RBI in the series.

In a final season with Philadelphia, Simmons led the AL with 216 hits. He batted .322, with 35 home runs, 151 RBIs and 144 runs scored in 1932. Simmons finished his Athletics tenure with a .356 batting average, 209 home runs, 1,179 RBI and 969 runs scored in 1,290 games. He drove in 100+ runs in all nine seasons and scored 100 or more runs in five seasons. In three World Series appearances for the A&#x27;s, Simmons hit .333 with six home runs, 17 RBI and 15 runs scored in 18 games.

===Later career (1933–1944)===
In late September 1932, the Athletics sold Simmons, Mule Haas and Jimmy Dykes to the Chicago White Sox for cash. The amount of the purchase was not disclosed at the time the sale was reported, though it was said to be the largest cash purchase ever made by the White Sox and possibly the largest purchase in AL history. Newspaper reports speculated that Athletics owner Connie Mack might be breaking apart the Athletics team that had been so successful between 1929 and 1931.

During his first season in Chicago, Simmons batted .331 with 14 home runs, 119 RBI and 200 hits. In 1934, he batted .344 with 18 home runs, 104 RBI, 102 runs scored and 192 hits in 138 games. After a disappointing final season with the White Sox, which saw Simmons bat just. 267 with 16 home runs and 79 RBI in 128 games (the first time in his 11-year career he did not reach .300 and 100+ RBI), he rebounded by hitting .327 with 13 home runs, 112 RBI and 96 runs scored in 1936 for the Detroit Tigers.

In 1937, he struggled again, this time with the Washington Senators, batting just .279 with 8 home runs and 84 RBIs in 103 games. He rebounded with a stellar season in 1938, batting .302 with 21 home runs and 95 RBI in just 125 games for Washington. His 21 home runs that year gave Simmons the distinction of being the first player to hit 20 home runs in a year for the Senators.

Simmons was purchased from the Senators by the Boston Bees in December 1938. The purchase price was not immediately revealed, though Simmons was reported as not getting along with Senators owner Clark Griffith. 

Simmons was purchased from the Bees by the Cincinnati Reds on August 31, 1939. The Reds won the NL pennant that year, and Simmons got to play in his final World Series. He played in one game in the 1939 World Series, going one for four with a double and a run scored.

Simmons played in the major leagues until 1944, when he finished his career with his original team, the Philadelphia Athletics.

===Overview===
Simmons was one of the best hitters in MLB history. He had a career batting average of .334. He hit .340 or better in eight different seasons, with four seasons of better than .380. He recorded a .300 batting average and 100 or more RBI in his first 11 major league seasons.

Simmons accumulated 1,500 hits in 1,040 games and 2,000 hits in 1,393 games, numbers that remain the fewest games needed to attain both marks in major league history. He compiled 200 hits or better in a season six times, with five of those being consecutive (1929–33), and had 199 and 192 hits in 1926 and 1934. He compiled more hits than any right-handed batter in AL history until surpassed by Al Kaline.

Simmons recorded 8 five-hit games and 52 four-hit games in the majors.

Simmons hit 307 career home runs, finishing in the top six in AL in home runs for seven consecutive seasons (1925–32). In 19 World Series games, he hit .329 with 6 home runs, 17 RBI, 15 runs scored and a .658 slugging percentage. He was also a fine outfielder in his era, recording a career .982 fielding percentage. He recorded exactly 5,000 putouts in his MLB career.

Simmons was nicknamed &quot;Bucketfoot Al&quot; because he strode toward third base when hitting.

==Later life and legacy==
After his playing days ended, Simmons served as a coach for Mack&#x27;s Athletics (1945–49) and the Cleveland Indians (1950). In early April 1951, Simmons announced he was dealing with an undisclosed illness and would be stepping down as a coach of the Indians. While Cleveland manager Al López encouraged Simmons to think about his decision, Simmons said he could no longer help the team.

Simmons died on May 26, 1956. He had collapsed on a sidewalk near the Milwaukee Athletic Club, where he lived, and was thought to have suffered a heart attack. He was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later. He was buried at St. Adalbert&#x27;s Cemetery in Milwaukee.

Simmons was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1951, the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953, and the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.

In 1999, Simmons ranked number 43 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In the 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James ranked Simmons as the 71st greatest baseball player of all time and the seventh greatest MLB left fielder of all time.

<text>Cape Dutch, also commonly known as Cape Afrikaners, were a historic socioeconomic class of Afrikaners who lived in the Western Cape during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The terms have been evoked to describe an affluent, educated section of the Cape Colony&#x27;s Afrikaner population which did not participate in the Great Trek or the subsequent founding of the Boer republics. Today, the Cape Dutch are credited with helping shape and promote a unique Afrikaner cultural identity through their formation of civic associations such as the Afrikaner Bond, and promotion of the Afrikaans language.

==Nomenclature==
At the onset of British rule in the Cape Colony, the preexisting population of European origin settled during the Dutch era was universally classified by the new colonial government as &quot;Hollanders&quot; or &quot;Dutch&quot;. In 1805, a relative majority still represented old Dutch families brought to the Cape during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; however, close to one-fourth of this demographic group was of German origin and one-sixth, of French Huguenot descent. Nevertheless, to the British authorities they represented a rather homogeneous bloc which could be easily distinguished by their common use of the Dutch language and shared adherence to the Dutch Reformed Church. Among the colonists themselves there had developed a notion of a Boer people; although the term could denote any Dutch-speaking white settler it was usually only the impoverished pastoral farmers on the colony&#x27;s frontier who applied this concept to themselves and formed a unique subgroup accordingly. In response, British immigrants and officials adopted the informal moniker &quot;Cape Dutch&quot; to distinguish between the better educated, wealthier Dutch speakers concentrated in the Western Cape and the self-styled &quot;Boers&quot;, whom they considered ignorant, illiterate, and uncouth. &quot;Cape Dutch&quot; may thus be regarded correctly as an English description rather than any sense of self-concept. When first introduced, the term was not actually used by Dutch-speaking whites in the Western Cape to describe themselves, and the idea of a unique Cape Dutch identity did not find widespread expression until the 1870s. The term&#x27;s explicit connotation to the Netherlands, and the indiscriminate manner in which it was applied by English speakers, also sparked a revival of interest among colonists of German or French origin in their ancestral roots.

==History==
Following the establishment of the Dutch East India Company&#x27;s initial settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, it became home to a large population of , also known as Free Burghers (free citizens). The earliest free burghers were Company employees who applied for grants of land and permission to retire in South Africa as independent farmers. Most were married Dutch citizens who committed to spend at least twenty years on the African continent. In exchange they received plots of thirteen and a half apiece, a twelve-year exemption from property taxes, and loans of seeds and agricultural implements. Reflecting the multi-national character of the company&#x27;s workforce and overseas settlements, smaller numbers of German and French Huguenot immigrants were also allowed to settle in South Africa, and by 1691 over a quarter of the Cape&#x27;s European population was not ethnically Dutch. Nevertheless, there was a degree of cultural assimilation due to intermarriage, and the almost universal adoption of the Dutch language. Cleavages were likelier to occur along socioeconomic rather than ethnic lines; broadly speaking, the Cape colonists were delineated into &quot;Boers&quot;, poor farmers who settled directly on the frontier, and the more affluent, predominantly urbanised &quot;Cape Dutch&quot;.

Differences between the Boers and the Cape Dutch increased as a result of the end of Dutch rule and the Great Trek. The Netherlands formally ceded its South African colony to Great Britain around 1815. While most of the Cape Dutch community accepted British rule and embraced the status of British subjects, the Boers remained fiercely independent and felt alienated by the new colonial administration. This culminated in the Great Trek, a mass migration of between 12,000 and 15,000 Boers deep into South Africa&#x27;s interior to escape British rule. Four-fifths of the Cape Colony&#x27;s Dutch-speaking white population at the time did not participate in the trek. The Dutch Reformed Church, to which most of the Cape Dutch and Boers belonged, explicitly refused to endorse the Great Trek as well.

Many Cape Dutch regarded the subsequent founding of the Boer republics with suspicion, as they perceived the cause of Boer republican nationalism to be retrogressive. Nevertheless, the Cape Dutch went on to develop their own nationalist movement in the late nineteenth century, which initially promoted cooperation and political alliances with the British. This policy began to dissolve after 1895, when local political leaders sought to distance themselves from Britain&#x27;s imperial agenda and what they perceived as unwanted interference by English capitalists such as Cecil Rhodes in the legal and constitutional traditions of the colony. Popular affectation for British imperial traditions, culture, and patriotism among the Cape Dutch was rapidly replaced by a more exclusive commitment to a greater Afrikaner nationalism. For his part Rhodes regarded the growth of pan-Afrikaner nationalism as an imminent threat, since a political union between the Boers and Cape Dutch would threaten British primacy in South Africa. He helped perpetuate preexisting rivalries between the two groups to circumvent this possibility.

The outbreak of hostilities between the British government and the Boer republics during the Second Boer War deeply split Cape Dutch society. Boer victories intensified patriotic pan-Afrikaner sentiments among the Cape Dutch. While many fought on the side of the British, an unknown number also defected to the Boer republics. As the Cape Dutch controlled over half the colonial legislature in the Cape Colony at the time, the perceived proliferation of pro-Boer sentiments led to unsuccessful attempts by Governor Lord Milner to disenfranchise them. Milner believed that most Cape Dutch secretly supported the Boer cause, and sought to ensure the local English-speaking population achieved political dominance through excessive gerrymandering. Many of the troops among the enlisted and officer ranks in the British Army shared Milner&#x27;s suspicions, with one soldier writing a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers&#x27; animosity towards Afrikaners at large: &quot;The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars trek farther out of our way the better. We do hate them down here like poison.&quot; Relatively few returning Cape Dutch fighters were disenfranchised as a result of joining the Boer war effort.

Prior to the Second Boer War, the narrow principles of Boer republicanism and the political alignment many Cape Dutch still held with the British Empire undercut any hopes for pan-Afrikaner unity. However, following the dismantling of the Boer republics, the exodus of many impoverished Boers to the cities, and the subsequent establishment of the Union of South Africa, the Cape Dutch and Boers increasingly formed a unified political bloc and socioeconomic differences between the two groups gradually diminished. The single most decisive factor in encouraging Cape Dutch and Boer unity in the postwar period appears to have been the preservation and promotion of the Afrikaans language.

==Society and politics==

The creation of a distinct Cape Dutch society was closely linked to the evolution of Cape Dutch group identities and Afrikaner nationalism. During the 1830s a small group of professionals in Cape Town made the first concerted attempt to simulate a sense of cultural identity among white Dutch speakers in the Western Cape, based on a shared language and history. This led to the formation of the first true Cape Dutch social institutions, namely the first Dutch university in the colony, the , and periodicals and societies aimed at Dutch speakers. In 1824, a Dutch periodical, the , appeared. A society for the promotion of the community&#x27;s history and the arts was also established, the . Christoffel Brand, son of a former Dutch colonial official and first Speaker of the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, was one of the most outspoken proponents for a unique Afrikaner ethnic consciousness. Brand argued that &quot;England has taken from the old colonists of the Cape everything that was dear to them: their country, their laws, their customs, their slaves, their money, yes even their mother tongue...[they] had done everything to prove that they wanted to be British, while their conquerors had continually worked to remind them they were Hollanders&quot;. In 1830, was started as a Dutch-language newspaper to counter the dominant influence of English journalism in the Western Cape.

In sharp contrast with the independently minded Boers, the Cape Dutch had no initial objection to the imposition of British rule for several decades, or even with the political domination of British colonists at the Cape. They hoped that the British government could grant preferential tariffs on Cape exports and were grateful for the latter&#x27;s decision to impose local tariffs on imported wine and other products. For its part the Cape Dutch elite stressed its loyalty to the British Empire and indeed looked for common cause with British immigrants as part of a wider white South African nationality rather than focusing on a narrow Cape colonial identity. Despite this, heavy-handed attempts to assimilate the Cape Dutch into the British way of life, including the adoption of the English language and British customs, aroused resentment. As the Cape Dutch began to embrace their position as a distinct society, concerns mounted that they were becoming estranged from their language and heritage. Opposition mounted toward the perceived campaign to make English the sole official language and give the colony an essentially British identity. The imposition of English in the Cape commerce, judiciary, and its political affairs made English a prerequisite for most professional careers. However, the Cape Dutch made no significant moves to resist until the British abolished the use of Dutch in public education, around 1865. This provoked a storm of outrage by Cape Dutch journalists, teachers, and clergy and alienated the Dutch-speaking intelligentsia. Shortly afterwards the Cape Dutch began to articulate widespread ethnic sentiments for the first time, and explore political strategies based on ethnic mobilisation. This may be regarded as the beginning of militant Afrikaner nationalism in the Cape, as the previously apolitical community began to form movements to defend its traditional values and dogma from anglicisation. Among these was the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners, established with a sworn determination to stand for &quot;our language, our nation, and our people&quot;. This coincided the beginning of a new trend as the Cape Dutch embraced the Afrikaans language for the first time as a symbol of their ethnic and national pride; for example, in 1876, Cape Dutch civic leaders sponsored the publication of the first Afrikaans language newspaper, . Previously, most Cape Dutch were actually bilingual in both Netherlands Dutch and Afrikaans, although they preferred the former. Afrikaans was seen as a language of servants, illiterate Boers, and nonwhites. The wholehearted embrace and promotion of Afrikaans during the late nineteenth century marked a reversal in this respect, although it did meet some resistance. The Dutch Reformed Church continued to uphold Netherlands Dutch as the language of worship, and Cape intellectuals also ridiculed what they saw as an attempt to elevate the status of a &quot;crude patois&quot;.

In 1880 Stephanus Jacobus du Toit founded the political party to coordinate activities between the and other civic associations. One of the goals of the Afrikaner Bond was to challenge the preponderance of English-speaking settlers in commerce by establishing their own banks, which then set up education funds for the Afrikaner community and helped Afrikaans-speaking entrepreneurs secure loans. With the renewed Cape Dutch interest in political affairs, their representation in parliament reached parity with English speakers and the Afrikaner Bond&#x27;s influence grew. Most of the parliamentarians were merchants or financial middlemen, who won their seats not only on the votes of the Cape Dutch, but also Boers in their outlying constituencies who felt indebted to them. Over the next decade, the Afrikaner Bond successfully lobbied for equal recognition of the Dutch language in courts and schools.

The Bond&#x27;s rhetoric of economic empowerment attracted widespread support from the small but wealthy Cape Dutch landowning gentry, which felt threatened by the growing influence Anglophone farmers were acquiring over aspects of state policy pertaining to agriculture and land use. However, as time went on it focused less on immediate practical concerns such as opposing Anglophone agendas and adopted pan-Afrikaner nationalism and the eventual unification of South Africa under a unitary state as its core principles. The Bond did succeed in unifying Cape Dutch and Boer political agendas when it became amalgamated with and the , the leading parties in the Transvaal and former Orange Free State, respectively, to form the South African Party in 1910. This became the first ruling party of the Union of South Africa and retained power until 1924.

==Demographics==
The Cape Dutch population was predominantly urban and concentrated around Cape Town and various settlements in the Western Cape&#x27;s interior. Cape Dutch settlement and migration patterns in the nineteenth century tended to reflect those of British colonists. Unlike the Boers, Cape Dutch emigrants were most likely to settle in other British territories in southern Africa, namely Southern Rhodesia and the Colony of Natal. During the late 1800s smaller numbers found employment in one of the Boer republics, the Orange Free State, where they were in high demand due to their education and technical skills. At one point all the civil servants and teachers residing in the Orange Free State were Dutch expatriates or Cape Dutch. Not all the Boer leaders were receptive to the idea of employing Cape Dutch, whom they regarded as foreigners; for example, Paul Kruger discouraged Cape Dutch immigration to the Transvaal Republic, because he feared they would compete with the Boers for jobs.

Since the Cape Colony&#x27;s census never differentiated between individual segments of the Dutch- or Afrikaans-speaking white population, the historic size of the Cape Dutch community is almost impossible to accurately calculate. It was estimated at 250,000 people in 1899.

<doc id="643767" wikidata="Q488953" url="?curid=643767" title="Korean count word">
<text>The Korean language uses special measure or counting words for specific objects and events. These suffixes are called &quot;subullyusa&quot; () in Korean. They are similar to the ones employed in the Chinese and the Japanese languages.

In English it is &quot;two sheets of paper&quot;, not &quot;two papers&quot;. Analogously, in Korean &quot;jang&quot; () is used to count sheets or anything that is a paper-like material, for example:

In fact, the meanings of counter words are frequently extended in metaphorical or other image-based ways. For instance, in addition to counting simply sheets of paper, &quot;jang&quot; in Korean can be used to refer to any number of thin, paper-like objects. Leaves (&quot;namunnip&quot; 나뭇잎) are counted using this count word. In this way, a particular count word may be used generally in a very open-ended manner and up to the construal or creativity of the speaker.

There are two systems of numerals in Korean: native Korean and Sino-Korean. Native Korean numerals are used with most counter words, and usually count the number of an object, while Sino-Korean numerals are generally used for indicating a specific object in series, such as a specific lesson in a book, as well as monetary units and scientific measurements. Sometimes both types of numerals may be used, usually native Korean numerals indicating a quantity and Sino-Korean numerals indicating an ordinal. For example:



There are exceptions, such as native Korean numbers being used with , meaning &quot;hour of the day&quot;. Additionally some counters (mostly those associated with traditional units) modify the pronunciation and spelling of the numerals that precede it, most notably 6월 is and 10월 is .

==List of count words==

<doc id="643768" wikidata="Q2488276" url="?curid=643768" title="Fecal occult blood">
<text>Fecal occult blood (FOB) refers to blood in the feces that is not visibly apparent (unlike other types of blood in stool such as melena or hematochezia). A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for hidden (occult) blood in the stool (feces).

The American College of Gastroenterology has recommended the abandoning of gFOBT testing as a colorectal cancer screening tool, in favor of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The newer and recommended tests look for globin, DNA, or other blood factors including transferrin, while conventional stool guaiac tests look for heme.

== Medical uses ==
Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), as its name implies, aims to detect subtle blood loss in the gastrointestinal tract, anywhere from the mouth to the colon. Positive tests (&quot;positive stool&quot;) may result from either upper gastrointestinal bleeding or lower gastrointestinal bleeding and warrant further investigation for peptic ulcers or a malignancy (such as colorectal cancer or gastric cancer). The test does not directly detect colon cancer but is often used in clinical screening for that disease. It can also be used to look for active occult blood loss in anemia or when there are gastrointestinal symptoms.

=== Colorectal cancer screening ===
An estimated 1–5% of large tested populations have a positive fecal occult blood test. Of those, about 2–10% have cancer, while 20–30% have adenomas. Screening methods for colon cancer depend on detecting either precancerous changes such as certain kinds of polyps or on finding early and thus more treatable cancer. The extent to which screening procedures reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or deaths depends on the rate of precancerous and cancerous disease in that population. gFOBT (guaiac fecal occult blood test) and flexible sigmoidoscopy screening have each shown benefit. Other colon cancer screening tools such as iFOBT (immunochemical fecal occult blood test) or colonoscopy are also included in guidelines.

In 2009, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) suggested that colon cancer screening modalities that are also directly preventive by removing precursor lesions should be given precedence, and prefer a colonoscopy every ten years in average-risk individuals, beginning at age 50. The ACG suggests that cancer detection tests such as any type of FOB are an alternative that is less preferred, and if a colonoscopy is declined, the FIT (fecal immunochemical test, or iFOBT) should be offered instead. The 2017 US Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF)&#x27;s recommended first-tier tests are a colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT test. If FIT is utilized, proper steps must be taken to ensure appropriate use and follow-up of abnormal FIT results. FIT tests however are not that useful in picking up adenomas, even when advanced.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)&#x27;s 2016 recommendation, instead of emphasizing specific screening approaches, has instead chosen to highlight that there is convincing evidence that colorectal cancer screening substantially reduces deaths from the disease among adults aged 50 to 75 years and that not enough adults are using this effective preventive intervention. The ACG and MSTF also included CT colonography every five years, and fecal DNA testing as considerations. All three recommendation panels recommended replacing any older low-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) with either newer high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (hs gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT). MSTF looked at six studies that compared high-sensitivity gFOBT (Hemoccult SENSA) to FIT, and concluded that there was no clear difference in overall performance between these methods.

The English National Health Service (NHS) introduced a Bowel Cancer Screening Program in 2006. It is now offered to patients aged 60–74 years. In 2019 FIT was introduced as the primary screening test in England and Wales, replacing gFOBt. However, research carried out in the UK has suggested that the FIT threshold for further investigation is set at a point that may miss more than half of bowel cancer cases and only identifies one in four high-risk polyps.

The American College of Gastroenterology has recommended the abandoning of gFOBT testing as a colorectal cancer screening tool, in favor of the fecal immunochemical test. Though the FIT test is preferred, even the guaiac FOB testing of average risk populations may have been sufficient to reduce the mortality associated with colon cancer by about 25%. With this lower efficacy, it was not always cost-effective to screen a large population with gFOBT.

If colon cancer is suspected in an individual (such as in someone with an unexplained anemia), fecal occult blood tests may not be clinically helpful. If a doctor suspects colon cancer, more rigorous investigation is necessary, whether or not the test is positive.

In 2006, the Australian Government introduced the National Bowel Cancer Program which has been updated several times since; targeted screening will be done of all Australians aged from 50 to 74 by 2020. Cancer Council Australia recommended that FOBT should be done every two years. People over 50 not yet eligible for the national program can arrange with their doctor for an FOBT.
The Canadian Cancer Society recommends that men and women aged 50 and over have an FOBT at least every two years.
In colon cancer screening, using only one sample of feces collected by a doctor performing a digital rectal examination is discouraged.

The use of the M2-PK Test is encouraged over gFOBT for routine screening, as it may pick up tumors whether or not they are bleeding. It is able to detect 80 percent of colorectal cancers and 44 percent for adenoma &gt; 1 centimeter, while gFOBT picks up 13 to 50 percent of colorectal cancers.

=== Other sources of bleeding ===
Gastrointestinal bleeding has many potential sources, and positive results usually result in further testing for the bleeding site, usually looking for lower gastrointestinal bleeding before upper gastrointestinal bleeding causes unless there are other clues. Colonoscopy is usually preferred to computerized tomographic colonography.

A positive test can result from upper gastrointestinal bleeding or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The common causes are:
* 2–10%: cancer (colorectal cancer, gastric cancer)
* 20–30% adenoma or polyps
* Diverticular disease
* Hemorrhoids
* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Angiodysplasia of the colon
* Sickle cell anemia

In the event of a positive fecal occult blood test, the next step in the workup is a form of visualization of the gastrointestinal tract by one of several means:
# Sigmoidoscopy, an examination of the rectum and lower colon with a lighted instrument to look for abnormalities, such as polyps.
# Colonoscopy, a more thorough examination of the rectum and entire colon.
# Virtual colonoscopy
# Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. It is sometimes performed with chromoendoscopy, a method that assists the endoscopist by enhancing the visual difference between cancerous and normal tissue, by either marking the abnormally increased DNA content (toluidine blue) or failing to stain the tumor, possibly due to decreased surface glycogen on tumor cells(Lugol). Infrared fluorescent endoscopy and ultrasonic endoscopy can interrogate vascular abnormalities such as esophageal varices.
# Double-contrast barium enema: a series of x-rays of the colon and rectum.

=== Testing secretions for blood ===
The use of an FOBT for bleeding from the mouth, nose, esophagus, lungs, stomach and the initial portion of the small intestine, while the same as fecal testing, is discouraged, due to technical considerations including poorly characterized test performance characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, and analytical interference. However, chemical confirmation that coloration is due to blood rather than coffee, beets, medications, or food additives can be of significant clinical assistance.

==Marathon runners==
Gastrointestinal (GI) complaints and low-intensity GI bleeding frequently occur in marathon runners. Strenuous exercise, particularly in elite athlete runners and less frequently in other exercise activities, can cause acute incapacitating gastrointestinal symptoms including heartburn, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding. Approximately one third of endurance runners experience transient but exercise-limiting symptoms, and repetitive gastrointestinal bleeding occasionally causes iron deficiency and anaemia. Runners can sometimes experience significant symptoms including hematemesis. Exercise is associated with extensive changes in gastrointestinal (GI) tract physiology, including diversion of blood flow from the GI tract to muscles and lungs, decreased GI absorption and small intestinal motility, increased colonic transit, neuroimmunoendocrine changes in hormones and peptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin and peptide-histidine-methionine. Substantial changes occur in stress hormones including cortisol, in circulating concentrations and metabolic behavior of various leucocytes, and in immunoglobulin levels and major histocompatibility complex expression. Symptoms can be exacerbated by dehydration or by pre-exercise ingestion of certain foods and hypertonic liquids, and lessened by adequate training.

Ingestion of 800mg of cimetidine two hours before running a marathon did not significantly affect the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms or occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Conversely, 800mg of cimetidine 1 hr before the start and again at 50 miles of a 100-mile running race substantially decreased GI symptoms and post-race guaiac test positivity but did not affect race performance.

==Methodology==

There are four methods in clinical use to test for occult blood in feces. These look at different properties, such as antibodies, heme, globin, or porphyrins in blood, or at DNA from cellular material such as from lesions of the intestinal mucosa.

* Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), and immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT). FIT products utilize specific antibodies to detect globin. FIT screening is more effective in terms of health outcomes and cost compared with guaiac FOBT. According to the guidelines of the American College of Gastroenterology, &quot;Annual fecal immunochemical testing is the preferred colorectal cancer detection test.&quot; A FIT test detects globin levels in feces at or above 50 nanograms per mL, the established cutoff by the World Health Organization for Colorectal Cancer Screening. FIT testing has replaced most gFOBT tests as the colon cancer screening test of choice. This methodology can be adapted for automated test reading and to report quantitative results, which are potential factors in design of a widescale screening strategy. The number of fecal samples submitted for FIT may affect the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the methodology.[8] High-sensitivity gFOBT tests such as Hemoccult SENSA remain an accepted option[8] and may retain a role in monitoring gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcerative colitis; however, the FIT test is preferred in recent guidelines. FIT is widely used outside of the US, and generally cost less than US$20 per test in 2020, compared to US$1,000 or more for a colonoscopy.

* Stool guaiac test for fecal occult blood (gFOBT): – The stool guaiac test involves smearing some feces onto some absorbent paper that has been treated with a chemical. Hydrogen peroxide is then dropped onto the paper; if trace amounts of blood are present, the paper will change color in one or two seconds. This method works as the heme component in hemoglobin has a peroxidase-like effect, rapidly breaking down hydrogen peroxide. In some settings such as gastric or proximal upper intestinal bleeding, the guaiac method may be more sensitive than tests detecting globin because globin is broken down in the upper intestine to a greater extent than is heme. There are various commercially available gFOBT tests which have been categorized as being of low or high sensitivity, and only high-sensitivity tests remain an acceptable alternative to FIT testing, which is now the best-practices recommendation in colon cancer screening. Optimal clinical performance of the stool guaiac test depends on preparatory dietary adjustment. The stool guaiac test for hidden (occult) blood in the stool should be used at home following the test kit&#x27;s directions with spontaneously passed stool or on samples submitted to a clinical laboratory. Testing kits are available at pharmacies in some countries without a prescription, or a health professional may order a testing kit for use at home. If a home fecal occult blood test detects blood in the stool it is recommended to see a health professional to arrange further testing.
* Stool DNA screening tests look for DNA alterations that have been associated with cancer.

Additional methods of looking for occult blood are being explored, including transferrin dipstick and stool cytology.

== Test performance ==

=== Reference standards ===

The estimates for test performance characteristics are based on comparison with a variety of reference methods including 51-chromium studies, analytical recovery studies in spiked stool samples, analytical recovery after ingestion of autologous blood, rarer studies of carefully quantified blood instilled at bowel surgery , as well as other research approaches. Additionally, clinical studies look at a variety of additional factors.

=== Gastrointestinal blood loss ===

In healthy people about 0.5 to 1.5ml of blood escapes blood vessels into the stool each day. Significant amounts of blood can be lost without producing visible blood in the stool, estimated as 200ml in the stomach, 100ml in the duodenum, and lesser amounts in the lower intestine. Tests for occult blood identify lesser blood loss.

=== Clinical sensitivity and specificity ===

Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) can identify as little as 0.3ml of daily blood in the stool; yet this test threshold does not cause undue false positives from normal upper intestinal blood leakage because it does not detect occult blood from the stomach and upper small intestine. Thus, the FIT test is much more specific for bleeding from the colon or lower gastrointestinal tract than alternatives. The detection rate of the test decreases if the time from sample collection to laboratory processing is delayed; processing the sample in under five days from collection is recommended. It does not appear to be affected by aspirin, anticoagulants, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Stool guaiac test for fecal occult blood (gFOBT) sensitivity varies depending on the site of bleeding. Moderately sensitive gFOBT can pick up a daily blood loss of about 10ml (about two teaspoonfuls), and higher sensitivity gFOBT can pick up lesser amounts, requires at least 2ml to become positive. The sensitivity of a single-stool guaiac test to pick up bleeding has been quoted at 10 to 30%, but if a standard three tests are done as recommended the sensitivity rises to 92%. Reduced patient compliance with the collection of three samples hampers the usefulness of this test. Further discussion of sensitivity and specificity issues that relate particularly to the guaiac method is found in the stool guaiac test article.

Fecal porphyrin quantification by HemoQuant can yield a false positive result due to exogenous blood and various porphyrins. HemoQuant is the most sensitive test for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and therefore may be most appropriate fecal occult blood test to use in the evaluation of iron deficiency. It is advisable to stop ingesting red meat and aspirin for three days prior to specimen collection. False positives can occur with myoglobin, catalase, or protohemes and in certain types of porphyria.

Fecal DNA tests as of 2008 had not been studied enough to support widespread use.

==Regulation==
Safety regulations from US accreditor the Joint Commission may have unintentionally decreased digital rectal examination and FOBT in hospital settings such as Emergency Departments.

<doc id="643769" wikidata="Q175751" url="?curid=643769" title="Quantum tunnelling">
<text>In physics, quantum tunnelling, barrier penetration, or simply tunnelling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which an object such as an electron or atom passes through a potential energy barrier that, according to classical mechanics, should not be passable due to the object not having sufficient energy to pass or surmount the barrier.

Tunneling is a consequence of the wave nature of matter, where the quantum wave function describes the state of a particle or other physical system, and wave equations such as the Schrödinger equation describe their behavior. The probability of transmission of a wave packet through a barrier decreases exponentially with the barrier height, the barrier width, and the tunneling particle&#x27;s mass, so tunneling is seen most prominently in low-mass particles such as electrons or protons tunneling through microscopically narrow barriers. Tunneling is readily detectable with barriers of thickness about 1–3 nm or smaller for electrons, and about 0.1 nm or smaller for heavier particles such as protons or hydrogen atoms. Some sources describe the mere penetration of a wave function into the barrier, without transmission on the other side, as a tunneling effect, such as in tunneling into the walls of a finite potential well.

Tunneling plays an essential role in physical phenomena such as nuclear fusion and alpha radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. Tunneling applications include the tunnel diode, quantum computing, flash memory, and the scanning tunneling microscope. Tunneling limits the minimum size of devices used in microelectronics because electrons tunnel readily through insulating layers and transistors that are thinner than about 1 nm.

The effect was predicted in the early 20th century. Its acceptance as a general physical phenomenon came mid-century.

== Introduction to the concept ==
Quantum tunnelling falls under the domain of quantum mechanics. To understand the phenomenon, particles attempting to travel across a potential barrier can be compared to a ball trying to roll over a hill. Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics differ in their treatment of this scenario.

Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier cannot reach the other side. Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down. In quantum mechanics, a particle can, with a small probability, &quot;tunnel&quot; to the other side, thus crossing the barrier. The reason for this difference comes from treating matter as having properties of waves and particles.

=== Tunnelling problem ===
The wave function of a physical system of particles specifies everything that can be known about the system. Therefore, problems in quantum mechanics analyze the system&#x27;s wave function. Using mathematical formulations, such as the Schrödinger equation, the time evolution of a known wave function can be deduced. The square of the absolute value of this wave function is directly related to the probability distribution of the particle positions, which describes the probability that the particles would be measured at those positions.

As shown in the animation, a wave packet impinges on the barrier, most of it is reflected and some is transmitted through the barrier. The wave packet becomes more de-localized: it is now on both sides of the barrier and lower in maximum amplitude, but equal in integrated square-magnitude, meaning that the probability the particle is &quot;somewhere&quot; remains unity. The wider the barrier and the higher the barrier energy, the lower the probability of tunneling.

Some models of a tunneling barrier, such as the rectangular barriers shown, can be analysed and solved algebraically. Most problems do not have an algebraic solution, so numerical solutions are used. &quot;Semiclassical methods&quot; offer approximate solutions that are easier to compute, such as the WKB approximation.

== History ==
The Schrödinger equation was published in 1926. The first person to apply the Schrödinger equation to a problem that involved tunneling between two classically allowed regions through a potential barrier was Friedrich Hund in a series of articles published in 1927. He studied the solutions of a double-well potential and discussed molecular spectra. Leonid Mandelstam and Mikhail Leontovich discovered tunneling independently and published their results in 1928.

In 1927, Lothar Nordheim, assisted by Ralph Fowler, published a paper that discussed thermionic emission and reflection of electrons from metals. He assumed a surface potential barrier that confines the electrons within the metal and showed that the electrons have a finite probability of tunneling through or reflecting from the surface barrier when their energies are close to the barrier energy. Classically, the electron would either transmit or reflect with 100% certainty, depending on its energy. In 1928 J. Robert Oppenheimer published two papers on field emission, &quot;i.e.&quot; the emission of electrons induced by strong electric fields. Nordheim and Fowler simplified Oppenheimer&#x27;s derivation and found values for the emitted currents and work functions that agreed with experiments.

A great success of the tunnelling theory was the mathematical explanation for alpha decay, which was developed in 1928 by George Gamow and independently by Ronald Gurney and Edward Condon. The latter researchers simultaneously solved the Schrödinger equation for a model nuclear potential and derived a relationship between the half-life of the particle and the energy of emission that depended directly on the mathematical probability of tunneling. All three researchers were familiar with the works on field emission, and Gamow was aware of Mandelstam and Leontovich&#x27;s findings.

In the early days of quantum theory, the term &quot;tunnel effect&quot; was not used, and the effect was instead referred to as penetration of, or leaking through, a barrier. The German term &quot;wellenmechanische Tunneleffekt&quot; was used in 1931 by Walter Schottky. The English term &quot;tunnel effect&quot; entered the language in 1932 when it was used by Yakov Frenkel in his textbook.

In 1957 Leo Esaki demonstrated tunneling of electrons over a few nanometer wide barrier in a semiconductor structure and developed a diode based on tunnel effect. In 1960, following Esaki&#x27;s work, Ivar Giaever showed experimentally that tunnelling also took place in superconductors. The tunnelling spectrum gave direct evidence of the superconducting energy gap. In 1962, Brian Josephson predicted the tunneling of superconducting Cooper pairs. Esaki, Giaever and Josephson shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics for their works on quantum tunneling in solids.

In 1981, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer developed a new type of microscope, called scanning tunneling microscope, which is based on tunnelling and is used for imaging surfaces at the atomic level. Binnig and Rohrer were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for their discovery.

== Applications ==
Tunnelling is the cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena.

=== Solid-state physics ===

==== Electronics ====
Tunnelling is a source of current leakage in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) electronics and results in a substantial power drain and heating effects that plague such devices. It is considered the lower limit on how microelectronic device elements can be made. Tunnelling is a fundamental technique used to program the floating gates of flash memory.

==== Cold emission ====
Cold emission of electrons is relevant to semiconductors and superconductor physics. It is similar to thermionic emission, where electrons randomly jump from the surface of a metal to follow a voltage bias because they statistically end up with more energy than the barrier, through random collisions with other particles. When the electric field is very large, the barrier becomes thin enough for electrons to tunnel out of the atomic state, leading to a current that varies approximately exponentially with the electric field. These materials are important for flash memory, vacuum tubes, and some electron microscopes.

==== Tunnel junction ====
A simple barrier can be created by separating two conductors with a very thin insulator. These are tunnel junctions, the study of which requires understanding quantum tunnelling. Josephson junctions take advantage of quantum tunnelling and superconductivity to create the Josephson effect. This has applications in precision measurements of voltages and magnetic fields, as well as the multijunction solar cell.

==== Tunnel diode ====


Diodes are electrical semiconductor devices that allow electric current flow in one direction more than the other. The device depends on a depletion layer between N-type and P-type semiconductors to serve its purpose. When these are heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling. When a small forward bias is applied, the current due to tunnelling is significant. This has a maximum at the point where the voltage bias is such that the energy level of the p and n conduction bands are the same. As the voltage bias is increased, the two conduction bands no longer line up and the diode acts typically.

Because the tunnelling current drops off rapidly, tunnel diodes can be created that have a range of voltages for which current decreases as voltage increases. This peculiar property is used in some applications, such as high speed devices where the characteristic tunnelling probability changes as rapidly as the bias voltage.

The resonant tunnelling diode makes use of quantum tunnelling in a very different manner to achieve a similar result. This diode has a resonant voltage for which a current favors a particular voltage, achieved by placing two thin layers with a high energy conductance band near each other. This creates a quantum potential well that has a discrete lowest energy level. When this energy level is higher than that of the electrons, no tunnelling occurs and the diode is in reverse bias. Once the two voltage energies align, the electrons flow like an open wire. As the voltage further increases, tunnelling becomes improbable and the diode acts like a normal diode again before a second energy level becomes noticeable.

==== Tunnel field-effect transistors ====
A European research project demonstrated field effect transistors in which the gate (channel) is controlled via quantum tunnelling rather than by thermal injection, reducing gate voltage from ≈1 volt to 0.2 volts and reducing power consumption by up to 100×. If these transistors can be scaled up into VLSI chips, they would improve the performance per power of integrated circuits.

==== Conductivity of crystalline solids ====
While the Drude-Lorentz model of electrical conductivity makes excellent predictions about the nature of electrons conducting in metals, it can be furthered by using quantum tunnelling to explain the nature of the electron&#x27;s collisions. When a free electron wave packet encounters a long array of uniformly spaced barriers, the reflected part of the wave packet interferes uniformly with the transmitted one between all barriers so that 100% transmission becomes possible. The theory predicts that if positively charged nuclei form a perfectly rectangular array, electrons will tunnel through the metal as free electrons, leading to extremely high conductance, and that impurities in the metal will disrupt it.

==== Scanning tunneling microscope ====
The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), invented by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, may allow imaging of individual atoms on the surface of a material. It operates by taking advantage of the relationship between quantum tunnelling with distance. When the tip of the STM&#x27;s needle is brought close to a conduction surface that has a voltage bias, measuring the current of electrons that are tunnelling between the needle and the surface reveals the distance between the needle and the surface. By using piezoelectric rods that change in size when voltage is applied, the height of the tip can be adjusted to keep the tunnelling current constant. The time-varying voltages that are applied to these rods can be recorded and used to image the surface of the conductor. STMs are accurate to 0.001 nm, or about 1% of atomic diameter.

=== Nuclear physics ===
==== Nuclear fusion ====
Quantum tunnelling is an essential phenomenon for nuclear fusion. The temperature in stellar cores is generally insufficient to allow atomic nuclei to overcome the Coulomb barrier and achieve thermonuclear fusion. Quantum tunnelling increases the probability of penetrating this barrier. Though this probability is still low, the extremely large number of nuclei in the core of a star is sufficient to sustain a steady fusion reaction.

==== Radioactive decay ====
Radioactive decay is the process of emission of particles and energy from the unstable nucleus of an atom to form a stable product. This is done via the tunnelling of a particle out of the nucleus (an electron tunneling into the nucleus is electron capture). This was the first application of quantum tunnelling. Radioactive decay is a relevant issue for astrobiology as this consequence of quantum tunnelling creates a constant energy source over a large time interval for environments outside the circumstellar habitable zone where insolation would not be possible (subsurface oceans) or effective.

Quantum tunnelling may be one of the mechanisms of hypothetical proton decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;url[nucl-th/9809006] Time-dependent properties of proton decay from crossing single-particle metastable states in deformed nuclei&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemistry ===

==== Energetically forbidden reactions ====
Chemical reactions in the interstellar medium occur at extremely low energies. Probably the most fundamental ion-molecule reaction involves hydrogen ions with hydrogen molecules. 
The quantum mechanical tunnelling rate for the same reaction using the hydrogen isotope deuterium, D− + H2 → H− + HD, has been measured experimentally in an ion trap.
The deuterium was placed in an ion trap and cooled. The trap was then filled with hydrogen. At the temperatures used in the experiment, the energy barrier for reaction would not allow the reaction to succeed with classical dynamics alone. Quantum tunneling allowed reactions to happen in rare collisions. It was calculated from the experimental data that collisions happened one in every hundred billion.

==== Kinetic isotope effect ====
In chemical kinetics, the substitution of a light isotope of an element with a heavier one typically results in a slower reaction rate. This is generally attributed to differences in the zero-point vibrational energies for chemical bonds containing the lighter and heavier isotopes and is generally modeled using transition state theory. However, in certain cases, large isotopic effects are observed that cannot be accounted for by a semi-classical treatment, and quantum tunnelling is required. R. P. Bell developed a modified treatment of Arrhenius kinetics that is commonly used to model this phenomenon.

==== Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds ====
By including quantum tunnelling, the astrochemical syntheses of various molecules in interstellar clouds can be explained, such as the synthesis of molecular hydrogen, water (ice) and the prebiotic important formaldehyde. Tunnelling of molecular hydrogen has been observed in the lab.

==== Quantum biology ====
Quantum tunnelling is among the central non-trivial quantum effects in quantum biology. Here it is important both as electron tunnelling and proton tunnelling. Electron tunnelling is a key factor in many biochemical redox reactions (photosynthesis, cellular respiration) as well as enzymatic catalysis. Proton tunnelling is a key factor in spontaneous DNA mutation.

Spontaneous mutation occurs when normal DNA replication takes place after a particularly significant proton has tunnelled. A hydrogen bond joins DNA base pairs. A double well potential along a hydrogen bond separates a potential energy barrier. It is believed that the double well potential is asymmetric, with one well deeper than the other such that the proton normally rests in the deeper well. For a mutation to occur, the proton must have tunnelled into the shallower well. The proton&#x27;s movement from its regular position is called a tautomeric transition. If DNA replication takes place in this state, the base pairing rule for DNA may be jeopardised, causing a mutation. Per-Olov Lowdin was the first to develop this theory of spontaneous mutation within the double helix. Other instances of quantum tunnelling-induced mutations in biology are believed to be a cause of ageing and cancer.

== Mathematical discussion ==
=== Schrödinger equation ===
The time-independent Schrödinger equation for one particle in one dimension can be written as
formula_1
or
formula_2
where
* formula_3 is the reduced Planck constant,
* &quot;m&quot; is the particle mass,
* &quot;x&quot; represents distance measured in the direction of motion of the particle,
* Ψ is the Schrödinger wave function,
* &quot;V&quot; is the potential energy of the particle (measured relative to any convenient reference level),
* &quot;E&quot; is the energy of the particle that is associated with motion in the &quot;x&quot;-axis (measured relative to &quot;V&quot;),
* &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a quantity defined by &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) − &quot;E&quot;, which has no accepted name in physics.

The solutions of the Schrödinger equation take different forms for different values of &quot;x&quot;, depending on whether &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is positive or negative. When &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is constant and negative, then the Schrödinger equation can be written in the form
formula_4

The solutions of this equation represent travelling waves, with phase-constant +&quot;k&quot; or −&quot;k&quot;. Alternatively, if &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is constant and positive, then the Schrödinger equation can be written in the form
formula_5

The solutions of this equation are rising and falling exponentials in the form of evanescent waves. When &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) varies with position, the same difference in behaviour occurs, depending on whether M(x) is negative or positive. It follows that the sign of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) determines the nature of the medium, with negative &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) corresponding to medium A and positive &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) corresponding to medium B. It thus follows that evanescent wave coupling can occur if a region of positive &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is sandwiched between two regions of negative &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), hence creating a potential barrier.

The mathematics of dealing with the situation where &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) varies with &quot;x&quot; is difficult, except in special cases that usually do not correspond to physical reality. A full mathematical treatment appears in the 1965 monograph by Fröman and Fröman. Their ideas have not been incorporated into physics textbooks, but their corrections have little quantitative effect.

=== WKB approximation ===
The wave function is expressed as the exponential of a function:
formula_6 where formula_7
formula_8 is then separated into real and imaginary parts:
formula_9 where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are real-valued functions.

Substituting the second equation into the first and using the fact that the imaginary part needs to be 0 results in:
formula_10

To solve this equation using the semiclassical approximation, each function must be expanded as a power series in formula_11. From the equations, the power series must start with at least an order of formula_12 to satisfy the real part of the equation; for a good classical limit starting with the highest power of the Planck constant possible is preferable, which leads to
formula_13
and
formula_14
with the following constraints on the lowest order terms,
formula_15
and
formula_16

At this point two extreme cases can be considered.

Case 1

If the amplitude varies slowly as compared to the phase formula_17 and
formula_18
which corresponds to classical motion. Resolving the next order of expansion yields
formula_19

Case 2

If the phase varies slowly as compared to the amplitude, formula_20 and
formula_21
which corresponds to tunneling. Resolving the next order of the expansion yields
formula_22

In both cases it is apparent from the denominator that both these approximate solutions are bad near the classical turning points formula_23. Away from the potential hill, the particle acts similar to a free and oscillating wave; beneath the potential hill, the particle undergoes exponential changes in amplitude. By considering the behaviour at these limits and classical turning points a global solution can be made.

To start, a classical turning point, formula_24 is chosen and formula_25 is expanded in a power series about formula_24:
formula_27

Keeping only the first order term ensures linearity:
formula_28

Using this approximation, the equation near formula_24 becomes a differential equation:
formula_30

This can be solved using Airy functions as solutions.
formula_31

Taking these solutions for all classical turning points, a global solution can be formed that links the limiting solutions. Given the two coefficients on one side of a classical turning point, the two coefficients on the other side of a classical turning point can be determined by using this local solution to connect them.

Hence, the Airy function solutions will asymptote into sine, cosine and exponential functions in the proper limits. The relationships between formula_32 and formula_33 are
formula_34
and
: formula_35

With the coefficients found, the global solution can be found. Therefore, the transmission coefficient for a particle tunneling through a single potential barrier is
formula_36
where formula_37 are the two classical turning points for the potential barrier.

For a rectangular barrier, this expression simplifies to:
formula_38

== Faster than light ==
Some physicists have claimed that it is possible for spin-zero particles to travel faster than the speed of light when tunnelling. This appears to violate the principle of causality, since a frame of reference then exists in which the particle arrives before it has left. In 1998, Francis E. Low reviewed briefly the phenomenon of zero-time tunnelling. More recently, experimental tunnelling time data of phonons, photons, and electrons was published by Günter Nimtz. Another experiment overseen by A. M. Steinberg, seems to indicate that particles could tunnel at apparent speeds faster than light.

Other physicists, such as Herbert Winful, disputed these claims. Winful argued that the wave packet of a tunnelling particle propagates locally, so a particle can&#x27;t tunnel through the barrier non-locally. Winful also argued that the experiments that are purported to show non-local propagation have been misinterpreted. In particular, the group velocity of a wave packet does not measure its speed, but is related to the amount of time the wave packet is stored in the barrier. Moreover, if quantum tunneling is modeled with the relativistic Dirac equation, well established mathematical theorems imply that the process is completely subluminal.

== Dynamical tunneling ==
The concept of quantum tunneling can be extended to situations where there exists a quantum transport between regions that are classically not connected even if there is no associated potential barrier. This phenomenon is known as dynamical tunnelling.

=== Tunnelling in phase space ===
The concept of dynamical tunnelling is particularly suited to address the problem of quantum tunnelling in high dimensions (d&gt;1). In the case of an integrable system, where bounded classical trajectories are confined onto tori in phase space, tunnelling can be understood as the quantum transport between semi-classical states built on two distinct but symmetric tori.

=== Chaos-assisted tunnelling ===
In real life, most systems are not integrable and display various degrees of chaos. Classical dynamics is then said to be mixed and the system phase space is typically composed of islands of regular orbits surrounded by a large sea of chaotic orbits. The existence of the chaotic sea, where transport is classically allowed, between the two symmetric tori then assists the quantum tunnelling between them. This phenomenon is referred as chaos-assisted tunnelling. and is characterized by sharp resonances of the tunnelling rate when varying any system parameter.

=== Resonance-assisted tunnelling ===
When formula_11 is small in front of the size of the regular islands, the fine structure of the classical phase space plays a key role in tunnelling. In particular the two symmetric tori are coupled &quot;via a succession of classically forbidden transitions across nonlinear resonances&quot; surrounding the two islands.

== Related phenomena ==
Several phenomena have the same behavior as quantum tunnelling. Two examples are evanescent wave coupling (the application of Maxwell&#x27;s wave-equation to light) and the application of the non-dispersive wave-equation from acoustics applied to &quot;waves on strings&quot;.

These effects are modeled similarly to the rectangular potential barrier. In these cases, one transmission medium through which the wave propagates that is the same or nearly the same throughout, and a second medium through which the wave travels differently. This can be described as a thin region of medium B between two regions of medium A. The analysis of a rectangular barrier by means of the Schrödinger equation can be adapted to these other effects provided that the wave equation has travelling wave solutions in medium A but real exponential solutions in medium B.

In optics, medium A is a vacuum while medium B is glass. In acoustics, medium A may be a liquid or gas and medium B a solid. For both cases, medium A is a region of space where the particle&#x27;s total energy is greater than its potential energy and medium B is the potential barrier. These have an incoming wave and resultant waves in both directions. There can be more mediums and barriers, and the barriers need not be discrete. Approximations are useful in this case.

A classical wave-particle association was originally analyzed as analogous to quantum tunneling, but subsequent analysis found a fluid dynamics cause related to the vertical momentum imparted to particles near the barrier.

<text>The purple starling (Lamprotornis purpureus), estorninho azul(argentina, peru, colombia), melro metálico (brazil) also known as the purple glossy starling, is a member of the starling family of birds.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a resident breeder in tropical Africa from Senegal and north Zaire east to Sudan and west Kenya. This common passerine is typically found in open woodland and cultivation.

==Description==
The adults of these stocky 22–23 cm long birds have a metallic purple head and body, and glossy green wings. They have a short tail and a yellow eye. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are much duller, with grey underparts and a brown iris.

==Behaviour==
This is a gregarious and noisy bird, with typical starling squeaks and chattering.

===Breeding===
The purple starling builds a nest in a hole. The normal clutch is two eggs.

===Feeding===
Like most starlings, the purple starling is omnivorous, eating fruit and insects.

<text>Cheapass Games is a game company founded and run by game designer James Ernest, based in Seattle, Washington. Cheapass Games operates on the philosophy that most game owners have plenty of dice, counters, play money, and other common board game accessories, so there is no need to bundle all of these components with every game that requires them. Cheapass games thus come packaged in white envelopes, small boxes, or plastic resealable bags containing only those components unique to the game - typically a rules sheet, a playing board printed on card stock, and game cards banded by magazine-cutout &quot;sleeves&quot;. This allows the company to produce games for prices well below the market average. Later, Cheapass started offering some higher-quality, full color games under the &quot;James Ernest Games&quot; brand.

==History==
Ernest originally developed the idea for selling basic games without all the common components while freelancing at Wizards of the Coast during the 1990s. However, Wizards rejected the idea, and in 1995, Ernest quit and started up the company. Creating the games by hand, he initially showed the games at tradeshows and conventions, resulting in sales demand from game stores. The company creates and assembles each game pack by hand, with most games only being made in runs of up to 5,000 copies.

Cheapass Games and James Ernest have won several awards for game design including the 2002 Origins Award for best play-by-mail game (&quot;Button Men Web Game&quot;),
the 2002 Origins Vanguard Award (&quot;Diceland&quot;), the 1997 Origins Award for best abstract board game (&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot;), and the 1997 Origins Award for best traditional card game (&quot;Give Me the Brain&quot;). 

Cheapass&#x27; game &quot;Pennywise&quot; was awarded the parodic 2003 &quot;Spud des Jahres&quot; award for most overpriced game by the website &quot;Spielboy&quot; (see Spiel des Jahres).

In 2004, the indie band Beatnik Turtle released &quot;The Cheapass Album&quot;, an album inspired by games from Cheapass Games.

In October 2007, Cheapass Games stopped updating their web site; a message on the homepage explained: &quot;Cheapass Games is in the process of hibernating, which means we can be a bit sluggish and hard to reach. Most of us have moved on to better careers, and James Ernest is slumbering peacefully in a warm hole in the ground.&quot;

In 2009, Cheapass created a &quot;Button Men&quot; app for the iPhone. Paizo Publishing is selling some Cheapass games on its website.

In 2011, Cheapass Games resumed updating their website with a new business model: Games were released for free in PDF format for gamers to print and play, and customers were asked to donate a dollar or two if they like the game. James Ernest says, in the game rules, &quot;I&#x27;ve decided to try a different gamble. I&#x27;m giving my games away for free. This way, you can read the rules, make a copy, and even play the thing, before you decide what it&#x27;s worth. If you do like my games, I hope you will send me some money. But I&#x27;m also hoping you will share this experiment with your friends. You are my sales force, my marketing department, my demo team.&quot; New games are usually accompanied by the Ransomometer, where potential customers are encouraged to donate a certain dollar amount before a game is released to the public.

In 2012, Cheapass Games offered their first Kickstarter project, a deluxe reprint of their previous game &quot;Unexploded Cow&quot;. This was followed in 2013 by another Kickstarter project for a deluxe version of their earlier &quot;Deadwood&quot; game, called &quot;Deadwood Studios USA.&quot;

In 2019, it was announced that Greater Than Games had acquired Cheapass Games. They have since opened a website with many free PDF offerings of older Cheapass Games titles.

== List of Cheapass Games ==
Several of the older games are out of print but are offered for free by Cheapass: the cards, rules, or other game materials may be downloaded for free, and Cheapass requests that if the recipient likes the game they should make a voluntary payment. Cheapass Games provides a chart of suggested donations based on the recipient&#x27;s profession/income level at their website.

<text>Joseph Michael Medwick (November 24, 1911 – March 21, 1975), nicknamed &quot;Ducky&quot; and &quot;Muscles&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball player. A left fielder with the St. Louis Cardinals during the &quot;Gashouse Gang&quot; era of the 1930s, he also played with the Brooklyn Dodgers (1940–1943, 1946), New York Giants (1943–1945), and Boston Braves (1945). Medwick is the last National League player to win the Triple Crown award (1937).

A ten-time All-Star, Medwick was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America in 1968 with 84.81% of the votes. In 2014, he became a member of the inaugural class of the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Medwick was born and raised in Carteret, New Jersey, the son of Hungarian immigrants. He excelled in baseball, basketball, football, and track at Carteret High School. Famed football coach Knute Rockne made arrangements for Medwick to play football at University of Notre Dame, but he chose professional baseball instead.

==Career==
Medwick entered professional baseball in 1930 with the Scottdale Scotties of the Middle Atlantic League. In 75 games he had a .419 batting average and 22 home runs. He spent most of the next two seasons with the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League. He played 161 games for Houston in 1931, hitting .305 with 19 home runs. He played in 139 games for the team the next year, hitting .354 with 26 home runs before being called up to the major leagues.

He made his MLB debut with the Cardinals in 1932. By 1934, he hit .319 with 18 home runs and 106 runs batted in (RBIs). Though Medwick swung at any pitch near the strike zone, he was difficult to strike out. He became known as one of baseball&#x27;s rising stars, but was competitive to the point of combativeness, and regarded by some as self-centered.

Medwick&#x27;s hard-charging style of play got him pulled out of the seventh game of the 1934 World Series by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis after a hard slide into third baseman Marv Owen on a triple which caused Detroit Tigers fans to pelt Medwick with fruits and vegetables. Landis also ordered Owen benched. Medwick remains the only known player to be thrown out of a game for his own personal safety. When asked about the incident after the game, Medwick replied, &quot;I knew why they threw them. What I don&#x27;t understand is why they brought them to the ballpark in the first place.&quot;

Medwick won the National League Triple Crown and the NL Most Valuable Player Award in 1937, leading the league with a .374 batting average, 31 home runs, and 154 RBIs. He remains the last NL player to win a Triple Crown. He would have won its home run component outright, but a home run hit in a June 6 game that was later wiped out by forfeit left him tied with Mel Ott. Medwick also led the National League with 237 hits, 111 runs scored, 56 doubles, 406 total bases, and a .641 slugging percentage. Before his 26th birthday, Medwick had accumulated 1,101 hits, the 12th highest total for a 25-year-old player in MLB history.

Medwick&#x27;s 64 doubles in 1936 remains the National League record. He also held the National League record with seven consecutive seasons with 40 or more doubles until Stan Musial topped it with nine. In 1940, the Cardinals traded Medwick and Curt Davis to the Dodgers for $125,000 and four lesser-known players. While still a solid hitter, Medwick never excelled defensively, where the Cardinals felt he was losing some of the skills he displayed in his 1937 Triple Crown season. Team president Branch Rickey and owner Sam Breadon also thought the trade would be best because they thought that Medwick was becoming increasingly discontented with being a Cardinal, having spent all season haggling with the pair over his contract.

Six days after the trade, Medwick was nearly killed by what some at the time regarded as a beanball thrown by former Cardinals teammate Bob Bowman. A mob of Dodgers led by their manager, Leo Durocher, charged the mound and had to be restrained from going after Bowman by the other Cardinals and the umpires. Uniformed members of the New York City Police Department sat with Bowman in the dugout to protect him from the crowd, and on request from Dodger president Larry MacPhail, nearly one hundred were present by the end of the game.

William O&#x27;Dwyer, Brooklyn&#x27;s district attorney, started an investigation to determine whether the hit by pitch was deliberate. Bowman blamed the incident on sign stealing by Dodgers coach Chuck Dressen. He said that Dressen would whistle each time he saw the sign for a curveball. Hearing the whistle, Medwick stepped toward what he thought was a curveball, but Bowman had decided to throw a high, inside fastball to confuse them. When Medwick strode forward, the ball hit him in the temple and rendered him unconscious. Medwick did not blame Bowman for the beaning, telling one of O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s aides: &quot;No direct threat had been made to me by Bowman. I saw the ball leave from his hand, but that was the last I saw of it.&quot;
NL president Ford Frick conducted his own investigation. Durocher and the Dodgers told him they still thought the hit by pitch was deliberate; Bowman countered that &quot;I never meant to hurt Joe.&quot; On June 20, O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s office dismissed the case for lack of evidence. The next day, Frick reached the same verdict.

Though contemporary baseball writers wondered if the beaning would affect Medwick&#x27;s playing, baseball historian Frank Russo does not believe that it did, pointing to Medwick&#x27;s strong statistics in 1940. In 1941, Medwick helped Brooklyn win their first pennant since 1920. He was traded to the New York Giants in 1943. During a USO tour by a number of players in 1944, Medwick was among several individuals given an audience by Pope Pius XII, who had been Cardinal Secretary of State before his elevation to the papacy. Upon being asked by the Pope what his vocation was, Medwick replied, &quot;Your Holiness, I&#x27;m Joe Medwick. I, too, used to be a Cardinal.&quot;

Late in his career, Medwick said that golf was helping him to stay in good physical condition; 36 holes per day allowed him to walk more than 10 miles &quot;without heavy strain&quot;.

In 1946, he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Browns, but coming out of spring training was unable to stick with the team and was seemingly out of baseball at just 34. He eventually returned to St. Louis to finish his career with the Cardinals in 1947 and 1948. Medwick retired with a .324 batting average, a ten-time All-Star over 17 Big League seasons.

He stayed in the game, at the minor league level. In 1949 he was player-coach of the Miami Beach Flamingos, a Class &#x27;B&#x27; team in the Florida International League. He had 375 at-bats in 106 games, with 121 hits for a .323 batting average. He continued playing through 1952 with Class &#x27;B&#x27; Raleigh and Tampa, but his numbers declined substantially.

==Career statistics==
In 1984 games played over 17 seasons Medwick compiled a .324 batting average (2471-7635) with 1198 runs, 540 doubles, 113 triples, 205 home runs, 1383 RBI, 437 bases on balls, .362 on-base percentage and .505 slugging percentage. He recorded a career .980 fielding percentage. In 12 World Series games (1934,1941), he hit .326 (15-46) with five runs, five RBI, and one home run.

==Later life==
In 1966, Medwick was hired as a hitting instructor in the Cardinals minor league system, a role he held until 1975. During spring training that year, on March 21, he died of a heart attack in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was buried at St. Lucas Cemetery in Sunset Hills, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.

==Legacy==
Medwick received no votes for enshrinement in the Baseball Hall of Fame the first seven years after his retirement, which is sometimes attributed to his strained relationship with teammates and the press. He continued to fall short of the required 75% vote threshold on numerous ballots until he was elected by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America in his final year of eligibility in 1968.

After his election, he said, &quot;This was the longest slump of my career. I had gone 0 for 20 before, but never 0 for 20 years.&quot;

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Medwick among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

Joseph Medwick Park along the banks of the Rahway River in Woodbridge Township and Carteret in Middlesex County, New Jersey is named in his honor.

<doc id="643798" wikidata="Q951759" url="?curid=643798" title="Shōrei-ryū">
<text>is a style of Okinawan karate and is one of the two oldest karate styles, alongside Shōrin-ryū. It was developed at the end of the 19th century by Higaonna Kanryō in Naha, Okinawa, Japan.

==Etymology==

&quot;Shōrei-ryū&quot; means &quot;the style of inspiration&quot; and certain martial arts scholars believe that the term &quot;Shōrei&quot; is derived from the Shoreiji Temple located in either [[Fujian] or Mount Jiulian of [[Longnan, Jiangxi]].

==Origin==
Little is known about the origins of Shōrei-ryū, but it was influenced in its early development by &quot;Shuri-te&quot;. [[Kanryo Higashionna]] originally studied Shuri-te with [[Sokon Matsumura]] and learnt [[quanfa]] from Chinese &quot;Wai Xinxian&quot; (assistant of [[Xie Zhongxiang]]). Higaonna later traveled to China to perfect his skills, which he probably succeeded in because he learned many new kata from [[Fujian]], the home of [[Baihequan]] (Chinese 白鶴 拳, Pinyin báihèquán) and adopted it in his style. The teachings of this temple provided the basis for the &quot;[[Naha-Te|Naha-te]]&quot; style of Okinawan karate.

Following passing of Higaonna Kanryo, the style began to take a new direction and became a purely &quot;internal&quot; combat style. This was due in large part to the influence of [[Choki Motobu]].

Although Motobu&#x27;s sensei style is still considered Naha-te, it actually had nothing to do with Higashionna. When Motobu became the leader of Shōrei-ryū, he began to guide his development in another direction, mainly because he trained with Anko Itosu of the Shuri-te style, a disciple of the great [[Sokon Matsumura]].

==Features of style==
The main features of Shōrei-ryū are the use of open hands, circular block techniques, and kicks to the &quot;gedan&quot; (lower-level) area.

In addition, the use of short and hard techniques in close combat in combination with throwing techniques is a specialty, especially from the &quot;sanchin&quot; and &quot;shiko-dachi&quot; stances. Great importance is also attached to training on the &quot;makiwara&quot;.

Another peculiarity is that the handling of [[Kobudō]] weapons such as &quot;bo&quot;, &quot;tonfa&quot; or &quot;sai&quot; is also very practiced. 

=== Shōrei-ryū Kata ===

Shōrei-ryū originates various kata that would be used in descendant styles like &quot;Gōjū-ryū&quot; and others.

==Further development==

Modern descendants of Shōrei-ryū include styles such as [[Gōjū-ryū]] and &quot;[[Ryūei-ryū]]&quot;. Gōjū-ryū is considered the direct evolution of Shōrei-ryū.

The &quot;[[Shitō-ryū]]&quot; style also contains many elements of Shōrei-ryū, since [[Mabuni Kenwa]] was a student of Higaonna, and even the &quot;[[Shōtōkan]]&quot; style contains kata from Shōrei-ryū, which, however, did not get there directly, but were passed on to Funakoshi Gichin and his students via Mabuni Kenwa. 

The Shōrei-ryū name (alternatively, Goju-Shorei-Ryu and later, Shorei-Goju Ryu) was also used for the style of karate brought to the [[United States]] by [[Robert Trias]]. Later, Trias used the name [[Shuri-ryu]], although some lineages still use the Shorei Ryu name. This style should not be confused with traditional Shōrei-ryū. Trias&#x27;s karate incorporated elements from Naha-te, Shuri-te, [[Tomari-Te|&quot;Tomari-te&quot;]], and others.

<text>A monolithic system is a system that is integrated into one whole, analogous to a monolith. The phrase can have slightly different meanings in the contexts of computer software and hardware.

==In application software==
In application software, software is called &quot;monolithic&quot; if it has a monolithic architecture, in which functionally distinguishable aspects (for example data input and output, data processing, error handling, and the user interface) are all interwoven, rather than containing architecturally separate components. Software systems like this are examples of monolithic applications.

==In hardware==
An electronic hardware system, such as a multi-core processor, is called &quot;monolithic&quot; if its components are integrated together in a single integrated circuit. Note that such a system may consist of architecturally separate componentsin a multi-core system, each core forms a separate componentas long as they are realized on a single die.

==In system software==
In system software, a monolithic kernel is an operating system (OS) architecture where the entire OS is working in kernel space.

<doc id="643802" wikidata="Q2825803" url="?curid=643802" title="Murder of Ibrahim Ali">
<text>The death of Ibrahim Ali (1978 – February 21, 1995) took place in Marseille, France, in 1995. Then aged 17, Ibrahim Ali, a French citizen of Comorian origins, was shot and killed by Robert Lagier on 21 February 1995.

==The shooting ==
On the night of February 21, 1995, Robert Lagier and his two friends Mario d&#x27;Ambrosio and Pierre Giglio, supporters of the far-right Front National headed to the immigrant neighbourhoods of north Marseille to hang posters for their party&#x27;s presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Under a smiling image of Mr Le Pen, the poster said: &quot;With Le Pen, Three million Immigrants Sent Home&quot;. At a traffic intersection, the men saw ten Afro-French youths running past them to get to a bus stop. They had just finished their rap rehearsal and carried instruments and sound equipment, and were running to avoid missing the last bus home. Robert Lagier drew his .22 pistol from an ankle holster. 17-year old Ibrahim Ali took a single bullet in the back, from which it struck his heart. He collapsed to the ground and quickly died of blood loss. Marco d&#x27;Ambrosio also drew his pistol and fired a few shots at the retreating Afro-French, though he didn&#x27;t hit anyone.

== Aftermath ==
After the incident, Laiger falsely claimed the youths had thrown stones at his car, and he was defending himself. However, police found no dents or cracks on the windshield and no rocks in the intersection around where his car was parked. The National Front backed Laiger completely, forming the &quot;DGL Association&quot; (after their initials) to &quot;help our prisoners&quot;. Bruno Megret, considered the successor to Le Pen within the NF, falsely claimed that the men had been &quot;violently attacked by about 15 Comorians&quot;. At the trial, Megret refused to apologize to the victim&#x27;s family on the ground that &quot;there is no collective responsibility in French law&quot;, but he praised the FN members as &quot;average Frenchmen&quot; who &quot;deserve respect and dedicate themselves to others, to love of their country and defence of their people.&quot;

Jean-Marie Le Pen initially responded to the murder, saying &quot;at least this unfortunate incident has brought to everyone&#x27;s attention the presence in Marseille of 50,000 Comorians. What are they doing here?&quot; However, following another murder of immigrants by members of the National Front, Le Pen stated, &quot;The people who did this are criminals and should be arrested by the police.&quot; Bruno Megret declared, &quot;the blame is on massive and uncontrolled immigration... if our billstickers hadn&#x27;t been armed, they would have probably been dead.&quot;

Robert Lagier was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for murder. His friend d&#x27;Ambrosio was convicted of attempted murder and convicted to 10 years in prison. Pierre Giglio, the third FN man, received a two-year sentence for illegally carrying a gun in his car.

Associations and elected officials from the city of Marseille have tried since the events, without success, to create a day in memory of Ibrahim on each 21st of February. Several other actions have been proposed in order to denounce racism but none have been implemented until 2015, when a memorial plate was installed where the incident took place. In February 2021, the city council decided to rename the Avenue des Aygalades to Avenue Ibrahim-Ali.

<text>The RA90 disk drive was the first Digital Equipment Corporation drive to be based on &quot;thin film&quot; technology. Prior to the RA90 all Digital disk drives used &quot;oxide&quot; disks, which were an aluminum disk coated with a polyurethane binder resin containing gamma ferric oxide particles as the recording medium. The 1988-released RA90, which held 1.2GB, was used with controllers implementing the Mass Storage Control Protocol.

==Overview==
The RA90 disk drive, in addition to being DEC&#x27;s first step into &quot;thin film&quot; technology, also introduced another first for &quot;DEC&quot;&quot;: &quot;Storage Arrays&quot;. Their first was the &quot;SA600 Storage Array&quot;, which had 4 or 8 drives. Other models were the SA550 and SA650 &quot;Mixed Storage Array&quot;s, combining RA70s with RA82s (SA550) or RA90s (SA650). The SA482 used just RA82s instead of RA90s.

Replacing the 1.2GB RA90s with 1.5GB RA92s, an &quot;SA800 Storage Array&quot; held 12GB.

==History==
The technology was pioneered by Ampex Corporation in Redwood City, California based on a slow motion and still frame video recorder the company had developed in 1967. In 1982 Ampex built a factory in San Jose, California that produced the first thin film disks. When Ampex ran into financial difficulties, the pioneer of thin film disk technology, Marv Garrison (now deceased) left Ampex to join Digital&#x27;s thin film disk facility in Colorado Springs. A long debate ensued at the time as to whether the magnetic layer on thin film disks ought to be sputtered or plated. Ampex and Digital settled on plating. However, in spite of the higher capital equipment investment required by sputtering, the latter proved in the long term to be the more reliable technology and remains as the industry standard today. It took Digital a long time to achieve adequate MTBF (mean time before failure) performance standards for the RA-90, which delayed its time to market sufficiently to be undersold by competitors, who, by then, had introduced smaller form factors (smaller disks) at higher capacities and greater reliability. RA-90 drives were built at Digital&#x27;s 1 million square foot (93,000 m²) facility in Colorado Springs and the disks were made in Tempe, Arizona.

==Technology==
Thin film disks consisted of a metallic coating applied onto an aluminum substrate which had first been coated with a nickel-phosphate alloy (non magnetic) to add hardness to the soft aluminum substrate. The reason thin film disks could provide higher storage capacity has to do with the physics of magnetic recording. A plated or sputtered magnetic layer could be made much thinner than the coated urethane binder layer. Magnets don&#x27;t like to be square, but rather rectangular. So, in the thin film one could place the magnetized domains much closer together whilst keeping the overall shape of the domain rectangular. This meant that adjacent magnetized areas of the disk surface could exist without cancelling each other out, or erasing the information recorded on the disk surface.

==Other RA disk drives==
Other &quot;DEC&quot; disk drives in the &quot;RA&quot; family were: RA60 (removable), and the RA70/71/72/73/80/81/82/92 (Winchester).

<doc id="643804" wikidata="Q6448208" url="?curid=643804" title="Kusum Kanguru">
<text>Kusum Kanguru (alternatively Kusum Kangguru, Kusum Kangru, Kusum Kang, Kusum Khangru, Kusumkhang Karda or Mount Kanguru) is a mountain in the Khumbu Region of the Himalayas in Nepal. Its name, Kusum Kanguru, means &quot;Three Snow-White Gods&quot; in the Sherpa language, which refers to the triple summit of the mountain.

The main north-south ridge of Kusum Kanguru forms the border between the Dudh Khosi to the west and the Hinku Valley to the east. The mountain is the main source of the Kusum Khola (or Thado Koshi Khola) which flows westward to merge with the Dudh Khosi at the village of Thado Koshi. Kusum Kanguru is one of the first high snowy mountains that become visible while trekking from Jiri to the Mount Everest base camp.

==Climbing history==
With an altitude of 6,367 metres (6,369m or 6,370m according to other map sources), the mountain is classified as a trekking peak, but it is considered one of the most difficult to climb. Out of twenty two attempts between 1978 and 1998, nine successful expeditions have been reported.

After four previously unsuccessful attempts by British, Japanese and two prior New Zealand expeditions, a Japanese expedition led by Ken Kanazawa reached the subsidiary northeast summit on 9 October 1979.

The first successful ascent of the main summit was made by Bill Denz of New Zealand on 7 October 1981, climbing the southwest buttress (west face), and descending the northwest flank. Denz did not only realise the first ascent, but also the first solo ascent and the first traverse of Kusum Kanguru. Five days later, on 12 October 1981, a Japanese team made the second ascent via the southeast face.

In the subsequent years, new routes have been opened, all of them technically very challenging.

1988 British Expedition led by Nick Mason, John Diplock and Julian Holmes conquered the previously unclimbed East Face. Expedition doctor was Rob Howarth who later worked in support of Everest Mountain Marathons. Expedition was filmed by Warwick Partington, former ITV &amp; Channel 4 TV director.

<text>R. M. Renfield is a fictional character who appears in Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 Gothic horror novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. He is Count Dracula&#x27;s deranged, fanatically devoted servant and familiar, helping him in his plan to turn Mina Harker into a vampire in return for a continuous supply of insects to consume and the promise of immortality. Throughout the novel, he resides in an asylum, where he is treated by Dr. John Seward.

In the various film adaptations of the novel, he has been portrayed by actors such as Alexander Granach, Dwight Frye, Roland Topor, Tom Waits, Peter MacNicol and Simon McBurney.

==During the novel==

A description of Renfield from the novel:

R. M. Renfield, aetat 59. Sanguine temperament, great physical strength, morbidly excitable, periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish, a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men, caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal. When duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only
accident or a series of accidents can balance it. — From Dr. John Seward&#x27;s journal
Renfield is an inmate at the lunatic asylum overseen by Dr. John Seward. He suffers from delusions which compel him to eat living creatures in the hope of obtaining their life-force for himself. Later Renfield&#x27;s own testimony reveals that Dracula would send him insects, which he begins consuming. He starts with flies, the death&#x27;s-head moth, then develops a scheme of feeding the flies to spiders, and the spiders to birds, in order to accumulate more and more life. When denied a cat to accommodate the birds, he eats the birds himself. He also changes his ideas to accommodate Mina Harker by quickly eating all flies and stating that it was an old habit. Seward diagnoses him as a &quot; maniac&quot;, or carnivorous madman. Later Renfield attacks Seward, acquiring a knife and cutting his arm; as Seward&#x27;s blood drips from his hand, Renfield licks it off the floor.

During the course of the novel, the role of Renfield as a patient allows the reader to understand his behavior from the perspective of a psychologist. Through Renfield&#x27;s demented mind, the reader learns the nature of a vampirism that is eventually revealed to be under the influence of Count Dracula; Renfield attempts to escape from the hospital multiple times to meet him. The vampire, whose abilities include control over animals such as rats, bats and spiders, comes to Renfield with an offer: if Renfield worships him, he promises to make him immortal by providing an endless supply of insects and rats, as Renfield believes that blood is the source of life much like Dracula himself.

However, when confronted by Mina Harker, Dracula&#x27;s latest victim, Renfield suffers an attack of conscience and begs her to flee from his master&#x27;s grasp. Consumed by his desire to keep Mina safe, he begs Seward and the others to allow him to leave lest he feel guilty for her fate. When Seward denies his request, Renfield tells the vampire hunters that &quot;[he] warned them!&quot; When Dracula returns that night, Renfield is again seized by his conscience. He remembers hearing that madmen have unnatural strength, and so attempts to fight Dracula. Renfield&#x27;s strength leaves him after looking into Dracula&#x27;s eyes, and Dracula throws him to the floor, severely injuring him.

The vampire hunters enter the room shortly afterward, and through an emergency surgery Van Helsing manages to prolong Renfield&#x27;s life. Renfield tells how he was convinced to invite Dracula in, detailing how Dracula entered the home and went after Mina. They leave him lying on the floor to rescue her. During the party&#x27;s confrontation against Dracula in Mina&#x27;s room, they manage to repel him with their crucifixes and wafers of sacramental bread, forcing him to flee the room. However, Dracula flees into other rooms and destroys their records, then back into Renfield&#x27;s room to break his neck. &quot;When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.&quot;

==Influence in psychology==
The character Renfield has influenced the study of real-life behavior in psychiatric patients with an obsession with drinking blood. The term Renfield syndrome was coined by psychologist Richard Noll in 1992, originally as a joke term, to describe clinical vampirism. Correspondingly, there is also a &quot;vampire personality disorder&quot; (VPD); a diagnosis for clinical vampirism, used for the behavioral profiling of serial killers compelled by bloodlust and for patients who act out violent vampiric fantasies; this diagnosis, however, is not recognized by the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5).

The effects of Renfield syndrome follows the pathology of the character in the novel consisting of several stages. Initially the patient exhibits zoophagia, a compulsion to eat insects, or to eat live animals or drink their blood. As the condition worsens, the behavior grows more and more deviant, culminating in a compulsion to drink another person&#x27;s blood in an act described as True-Vampirism, including intentionally harming another individual for that purpose—the same behavior Renfield is seen exhibiting in the novel.

==On screen==
* F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror&quot; (1922 silent film), loosely based on Stoker&#x27;s novel, renames Renfield (Alexander Granach) as Knock, and combines him with Mr. Hawkins, the employer of the hero Harker (renamed Thomas Hutter).

* In Tod Browning&#x27;s 1931 film and George Melford&#x27;s 1931 film, Renfield (played by Dwight Frye in the English version and Pablo Álvarez Rubio in the Spanish version) is the real estate agent who is sent to Transylvania instead of Jonathan Harker, and falls under Dracula&#x27;s (Bela Lugosi/Carlos Villarías) power. Frye&#x27;s performance is the best-known and, as noted below, the most imitated, as well as the role he is best remembered for.
* In the 1970 film &quot;Count Dracula&quot;, Klaus Kinski played Renfield as mute. His link to the Count is explained in terms of his travel to Transylvania once and his horrible experience near Castle Dracula, when his young daughter died. 
* The BBC version of &quot;Count Dracula&quot; (1977), starring Louis Jourdan in the title role, includes Jack Shepherd as a sympathetic Renfield in a prominent role which highlights his relationship with Mina.
* The 1979 film &quot;Dracula&quot;, starring Frank Langella in the title role, has Tony Haygarth playing Milo Renfield as an unkempt workman who is enthralled by Dracula while he is unloading the boxes at Carfax.
* Another 1979 film, &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; by Werner Herzog, with Klaus Kinski in the main role, features giggling Renfield, the former boss of Jonathan Harker (similarly to the character&#x27;s background in the 1922 silent film), now a mental asylum patient and a plague spreader, played by Roland Topor.
* Arte Johnson plays Renfield in &quot;Love at First Bite&quot; (1979), where he is seen being a loyal servant to Dracula in the 1970s as he and his master move to New York. Johnson imitates the Dwight Frye laugh.

* Tom Waits portrays R. M. Renfield in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1992 film adaptation &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. The film suggests that Renfield was Jonathan Harker&#x27;s predecessor as Count Dracula&#x27;s agent in London; it is implied that this is the reason for his madness. He tries to persuade Mina to stay out of Dracula&#x27;s grasp out of jealousy, angry that Dracula plans to give her immortality instead of him.
* Peter MacNicol plays the comedic, simple-minded Thomas Renfield in Mel Brooks&#x27; 1995 film &quot;&quot;. The role is a parody of Dwight Frye&#x27;s Renfield from the 1931 film.
*Brett Forest plays Renfield in &quot;Dracula&quot; (2002), where events of the novel were updated to the modern time period.
*Manoj portrayed Renfield in the 2005 Indian Malayalam-language television series, &quot;Dracula&quot;, which aired on Asianet.
* Simon Ludders portrays Percival Renfield in &quot;Young Dracula&quot; (2006–2014), in which the manservant is depicted as an unwashed dimwit with repulsive taste in food (though this aids him in preparing meals for vampires) and prodigious knowledge of science. Renfield is unquestioningly loyal to Dracula in the hope of one day being turned into a vampire, and seems to partly enjoy the abuse Dracula inflicts upon him when he makes mistakes. Renfield ultimately becomes a vampire in the series&#x27; concluding episodes, though he proves inept at using his new powers. Ludders also portrays Renfield&#x27;s father, a cruel man who is resurrected and promptly enacts a plan to destroy the Draculas, but the younger Renfield ultimately undoes his resurrection.
* Ian Pfister plays Renfield in &quot;Dracula Reborn&quot; (2012). The events take place in modern Los Angeles. Renfield is an associate of Dracula, who moved to California.
* Giovanni Franzoni portrays Renfield in the 2012 film &quot;Dracula 3D&quot;. Here, he attacks the men attempting to stake Tania (who&#x27;d been attacked by Dracula), killing her ex-lover and berating him for leaving her alone the night she was attacked. Later, he comforts Tania (now a vampire) when Dracula is showing interest in Mina. After Van Helsing kills her, Renfield attacks him, referring to Tania as an &quot;angel,&quot; before Van Helsing kills him.
* In NBC and Sky Living&#x27;s 2013 television series, Renfield is portrayed by Nonso Anozie. In contrast to other Renfields, this version is well-educated and fully sane, having been recruited by Dracula to act as his lawyer after Dracula met him on a train, serving as Dracula&#x27;s confidant and with Dracula expressing complete faith in his loyalty. He is killed by Professor Van Helsing in the final episode when Renfield finds Van Helsing destroying the serum that allows the vampire to walk in the sunlight.
* Samuel Barnett portrays Renfield in the third and final season of the Showtime drama &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014–2016).
* Ewan Bailey voices Renfield in the 2017 animated horror comedy &quot;Monster Family&quot;, where he is Dracula&#x27;s butler, who ultimately sides with protagonists against his master.
* In the 2020 miniseries &quot;Dracula&quot;, the character, now named Frank Renfield, is depicted as Count Dracula&#x27;s lawyer in 21st-century Britain. He is portrayed by Mark Gatiss, who co-wrote the series with Steven Moffat.
* Stuart Packer portrays Renfield in 2022 film titled &quot;Dracula: The Original Living Vampire.&quot; Here, he is detective Amelia Van Helsing&#x27;s boss and idol, and he helps her investigate a string of abnormal murders. It is later revealed that Renfield was in fact making a hit list for the killer, who later turns out to be Dracula, who is a powerful vampire. Renfield is shot and killed by Van Helsing, but only to be awakened as a vampire by Dracula, only before he is killed for good.

* Nicholas Hoult portrays Robert Montague Renfield in the 2023 movie &quot;Renfield&quot;, taking place in present day New Orleans, where he has been Dracula&#x27;s familiar for 90 years and searches for victims to feed him. Renfield joins a self-help group for people in codependent relationships and finds the confidence to leave Dracula&#x27;s servitude. He and traffic cop Rebecca Quincy ultimately kill Dracula. The movie was based on a pitch from Robert Kirkman. Chris McKay came on board in April 2021 to direct. The script was written by Ryan Ridley.
* Simon McBurney plays Herr Knock, the renamed Renfield, in the 2024 remake of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. Once again Thomas Hutter&#x27;s employer and secretly Orlok&#x27;s servant, this version is particularly violent and fanatical. He ritually kills and devours the flesh of birds and sheep, and moves on to homicide after escaping custody.

==On stage==
*Renfield appears in 1924 stage play &quot;Dracula &quot;by Hamilton Deane. In the play he is killed by Dracula for betraying him. He was played by G. Malcolm Russell and Bernard Jukes in English productions. The play was revised by John. L. Balderston for American audiences in 1927. In the revised version Renfield survives. Bernard Jukes reprised the role on Broadway.
*Renfield appears in &quot;Dracula, The Musical&quot; by Frank Wildhorn. He has his own song &quot;The Master&#x27;s Song&quot;. He was played by Don Stephenson in Broadway production of the musical.
*Renfield was played by Daniel Boucher in Franco-Canadian 2006 musical &quot;Dracula – Entre l&#x27;amour et la mort&quot;.
*Renfield was portrayed by Kevin Poeung in 2019 Northern Ballet&#x27;s production of &quot;Dracula&quot; by David Nixon. The production was recorded and showed in UK cinemas on Halloween and then broadcast on BBC4 in 2020.

==In other media==
===In literature===
* In the Jim Butcher novel &quot;Blood Rites&quot;, &quot;Renfield&quot; is used as a term for people forcibly turned into mindless henchmen by vampires.
* In the novel &quot;A Betrayal in Blood&quot; by Mark A. Lathan, it is revealed that Renfield was the solicitor who traveled to Transylvania to meet with Dracula rather than Jonathan. As part of a complex conspiracy against Count Dracula (who is only human in this version of events), Van Helsing manipulated events to drive Renfield mad, and then helped the Harkers kill the head of Harker and Renfield&#x27;s firm so that they could claim that Renfield&#x27;s experiences were Jonathan&#x27;s to further justify the Harkers&#x27; &#x27;vendetta&#x27; against Dracula.
* In the novel &quot;The Book of Renfield: A Gospel of Dracula&quot; by Tim Lucas, Renfield is buried under the name Rhys Malvern Renfield, although this is not his real full name, which remained unknown at the time of his death.
* According to the novel &quot;Renfield: Slave of Dracula&quot; by Barbara Hambly, Renfield&#x27;s first name is Ryland.

==Characters based on Renfield==
* In &quot;Drakula İstanbul&#x27;da&quot; (1953) the character of Renfield does not exist. Instead, Dracula has a servant in his castle, who obeys him. When this servant tries to help Azmi (Jonathan Harker), Dracula kills him.
* In the TV adaptation &quot;Dracula&quot; (1968) the character of Renfield does not exist. Instead, Jonathan Harker takes up many of his functions: he goes mad after visiting Dracula&#x27;s castle, ends up in Dr. Seward&#x27;s asylum and does Dracula&#x27;s bidding.
* In &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, which loosely follows the plot of the 1924 stage play &quot;Dracula&quot;, Julius Jones (Kadeem Hardison) is placed under vampire Maximillian&#x27;s (Eddie Murphy) spell and becomes a zombie-like servant.
* In the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; episode &quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot; (2000), Xander Harris falls under the spell of Dracula, begins devouring insects and spiders for much of the episode, calls Dracula &quot;Master&quot; and obeys his orders.
*Although he is not present in &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004), Igor takes up the mantle of Dracula&#x27;s servant, ready to do his bidding.
*While not in the 2014 film &quot;Dracula Untold&quot;, a Roma man portrayed by Zach McGowan does refer to the titular character as &quot;Master&quot;, much like Renfield addresses Count Dracula. If a sequel had happened, McGowan would have returned, portraying Renfield.
*In the 2016 short film &quot;The Phantom Hour&quot;, the character Bryce, portrayed by Brian Patrick Butler, is a vampire&#x27;s right-hand man who was compared to Renfield.

<doc id="643812" wikidata="Q962866" url="?curid=643812" title="Weston, Toronto">
<text>Weston is a neighbourhood and former town in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The neighbourhood is situated in the northwest of the city, south of Highway 401 and Highway 400/Black Creek Drive, east of the Humber River, north of Eglinton Avenue, and west of Jane Street. The eponymous Weston Road, just north of Lawrence Avenue is the historic core of Weston, with many small businesses and services. Weston was incorporated as a village in the 19th century and was absorbed into the Borough of York in the late 1960s. York itself was amalgamated into Toronto in 1998. Weston is one of the few former towns and villages in Toronto located in a generally suburban setting, although it is contiguous with the inner city to the southeast along Weston Road. It is also one of the few not developed as a planned satellite town, as is the case with Leaside or New Toronto.

==Description==
Weston&#x27;s building stock consists mostly of Victorian homes east of the railway with apartment and condominium towers on Weston Road overlooking the Humber River valley. Weston&#x27;s main shopping district is located on Weston Road between Church Street in the north and Wilby Crescent (just south of Lawrence Avenue) in the south. Most buildings in this area reflect early-mid-20th century Ontario town architecture, brick buildings with decorative masonry. The area has a noteworthy library (previously a Mechanics&#x27; Institute and Carnegie library). The community is dotted with grand old churches with architectural significance. There has been a recent move in Weston to designate certain areas as a historical district.

Most streets in Weston are lined with tall mature trees, some well over 100 years old. This is more common east of the railway tracks. Recently, there has been some infill development on former industrial and commercial lands bringing some new housing stock to the area. On April 26, 2013, a fire was accidentally started at 2304 Weston Road, due to tar during roof construction.

== History ==
The first European settlement in the Weston area took place in the 1790s, when a saw mill was built in Etobicoke Township on an old native trading path along the west side of the Humber River, named after the well-known Humber estuary in Yorkshire, England. In 1815 James Farr, a prominent local mill owner, named the growing settlement after his birthplace, Weston, Hertfordshire. Weston initially developed along both sides of the river until a disastrous flood in 1850 destroyed the west bank settlement. The former west bank settlement is now the site of the Weston Golf and Country Club. Improvements to Main Street (later renamed as part of Weston Road) and the 1856 arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway brought growth on the east side.

The first post office was opened in 1842. The first library opened in 1858, a Mechanic&#x27;s Institute. In 1865, the Trinity College School opened, founded by William Arthur Johnson. It was located in Weston near the old Mill and at a home further north until 1867. It relocated to Port Hope, Ontario in 1868.

A second railway company arrived in 1869. On October 5, 1869, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn attended the sod turning ceremony for the construction of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway. The spade which he used for the event is kept in the public library.

The town of Weston grew, and over the 19th century became an important industrial centre for the Toronto area. The symbol adopted for the town, an outline of an old-fashioned bicycle, was based on this history of manufacturing and especially the old CCM bicycle factory on Lawrence Avenue just east of Weston Road. Models of bicycles now hang from the streetlights along Weston Road.

Weston was incorporated as a village in 1881, and then as a town in 1914. In 1914, the town also saw the opening of Weston Public Library, a Carnegie library. This building is now recognized with heritage status.

In October 1954, Hurricane Hazel flooded the Humber River valley, causing death and destruction of property. In response, low-lying areas in the Humber River valley were converted to parkland and property zoning standards were changed across Ontario to avoid building encroachment on floodplains. There is a memorial in the south end of Lions Park near a pedestrian bridge which incorporates the original footing of a bridge that once crossed the Humber. The other footing of the bridge is the square chunk of concrete that is in the middle of the river nearby.

In 1967, it became part of the Borough (later City) of York. In 1998, York was in turn amalgamated with the five other members of Metropolitan Toronto, (Toronto, Etobicoke, North York, East York, and Scarborough) in the new &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto. Vocal lobbying at the time allowed Weston to retain many street names which are exact duplicates of downtown streets, including Church Street, King Street and John Street.

=== Airport link controversy ===
The Union Pearson Express between Toronto Pearson International Airport and Union Station downtown was a hot political issue in Weston. It had originally been proposed for completion by 2009. Weston is currently a station stop on the Kitchener line operated by GO Transit and additional airport trains would stop there. The link would see the construction of three additional tracks through the neighbourhood and increased rail traffic more than fourfold. Community activists worried about how the link would sever the community (vehicle traffic on John Street will be permanently blocked from crossing the tracks, replaced by a pedestrian bridge) and the possibility of lower future property values due to increased noise and diesel fumes.

It was an issue during the Canadian federal election held on January 23, 2006, when incumbent Liberal Member of Parliament, Alan Tonks, supported the link, while the other candidates opposed it. It was also an issue in the February 2007 provincial by-election, where all local candidates came out against the link, but which was still supported by the governing Liberals. The Weston Community Coalition (WCC) had proposed a subway line as an alternative to run through the Weston rail corridor to the airport that would have stops along the way which would serve many communities throughout Toronto and be operated by the TTC rather than a private company. Various other alternatives were presented by community activists such as an Eglinton subway to the airport, an LRT alternative, or a route down Highway 427.

In the end, the tracks went into a trench with bridges overhead to prevent bisecting the neighbourhood. A &quot;rail deck park&quot; allowed the expansion of a Toronto Catholic school playground over the tracks.

==Demographics==
In 2016, the Weston neighbourhood was home to 17,992 residents. 60% of the population speak English as their first language, 6.4% speak Spanish, 4.8% speak Portuguese, 4.3% speak Somali and 3.1% speak Italian.

Major racial and ethnic populations (2016): 
* 38.0% White; &quot;8.8% Italian&quot;, &quot;8.3% British, &quot;7.4% Scottish
* 33.6% Black; &quot;13.1% Jamaican&quot;, &quot;6.0% Somali&quot;, &quot;4.9% other African Canadian (including Black Nova Scotian)
* 7.7% Latin American (of any race)
* 4.3% South Asian
* 3.3% Filipino

== Transportation ==

Main throughfares serving Weston are Lawrence Avenue West and Weston Road. A number of local roads in Weston resulted in name duplication after Toronto amalgamation in 1998:

* John Street - a residential street from Jane Street to Weston Road has same name as the more famous John Street. The section just east of S Station Street is now cut off after Union Pearson Express was built; the previous level crossing replaced with pedestrian bridge over trench with tracks below.
* King Street - a residential street from Jane Street to Weston Road has same name as the more famous King Street downtown.
* Church Street - a residential street from Jane Street to Weston Road has same name as the more famous Church Street downtown.

=== Public transportation ===

The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) runs several bus routes through the area, linking to the subway system. The 32 Eglinton West, 35 Jane, 52 Lawrence West, 59 Maple Leaf, 73 Royal York, 79 Scarlett, and 89 Weston all pass through the neighbourhood.

As of January 2012, all TTC bus routes serving Weston are accessible. Routes 52 and 352 were the final TTC bus routes to be made accessible, with the retirement of the last GMC New Look &quot;Fishbowl&quot; buses in December 2011. Although all bus routes are accessible, individual stops along the routes may not meet accessibility standards.

The Metrolinx Weston GO Station is located at Weston Road and Lawrence Avenue. The station is served by the Kitchener line (which connects Kitchener, Ontario to downtown Toronto during rush hours) and the Union Pearson Express (all-day service between Toronto Pearson International Airport and downtown Toronto). The Weston GO Station is wheelchair accessible.

== Recreation ==

The Weston Farmers&#x27; Market opens weekly from mid-May to the end of October near the centre of Weston. The Weston BIA also hosts a Harvest Festival around Thanksgiving in October, and the &quot;Weston Santa Claus Parade&quot; each November.

Weston has many small parks throughout but most notable is Cruickshank Park in the Humber River valley with many mature trees and paved bicycle paths lined with large weeping willow trees. The bicycle path continues south to Lake Ontario. Sometimes salmon can be seen swimming upstream in the river. The park has a population of beaver as can be seen from the tell-tale marks left behind on trees. In order to protect some trees, park staff have wrapped the tree trunks with wire screen in some areas. There are also some frogs closer to the water&#x27;s edge and garter snakes hidden away in the more secluded areas. Canada geese, loons, mallards and seagulls are a common sight. Herons have also been spotted looking for fish in the river.

In some areas of the park, you can see exposed sedimentary rock in the walls of the valley, made visible by the action of glaciers that carved out the valley during the last glacial period about 20,000 years ago. The same rock was used to build many stone retaining walls throughout the town; an example of this use can be seen on the south end of the Lawrence Avenue bridge in the north end of Lions Park.

Weston Lions Park, located south of Lawrence Avenue, fills and contains facilities for playing football, rugby union, soccer, tennis, and baseball, as well as an ice rink, swimming pool, basketball court and skatepark.

=== Weston Arena ===

Originally as Weston Arena, it is now known as either Weston Lions Arena or Weston Lions Recreation Arena. The arena was proposed on what was the Weston Fairgrounds in 1944, opened in 1949 and gained a pool in 1959.

The arena hosted the Toronto Dixie Beehives of the Ontario Junior Hockey League from 2007 to 2009. The arena currently hosts the Weston Minor Hockey League and Weston Dodgers.

<text>In baseball, an inside-the-park home run is a rare play in which a batter rounds all four bases for a home run without the baseball leaving the field of play. It is also known as an &quot;inside-the-parker&quot;, &quot;in-the-park home run&quot;, or &quot;in-the-park homer&quot;.

==Discussion==
The vast majority of home runs occur when a batter hits the ball beyond the outfield fence on the fly, which requires striking the ball with enough power at the correct flight angle to clear the outfield, allowing the batter to trot around the bases at leisure albeit at a decent pace to avoid infuriating the opposition. Though an inside-the-park home run is scored in the same manner, achieving the feat requires the batter to touch all four bases (in the order of first, second, and third, ending at home plate) before being tagged out by an opposing player, all while the ball remains in play.

Inside-the-park home runs typically occur when a fast baserunner either hits the ball to the portion of the field farthest from where the opposing team&#x27;s fielders are positioned or when a sharply hit ball takes an unexpected bounce away from defenders. They can also be the result of weather conditions like wind gusts or fog that reduce defenders&#x27; ability to track a moving ball. Sometimes (such as Alcides Escobar&#x27;s inside-the-park homer in the 2015 World Series), an outfielder could lose sight of the ball in the stadium floodlights or against a light-colored roof of a domed stadium. Since a play is usually not ruled an error unless a fielder touches the ball, these scenarios can result in a home run if the batter is able to circle the bases before the defenders can track down the ball and get it to home plate.

If the defensive team is charged with an error on the play, the batter is not credited with a home run, but rather as having advanced on an error. At advanced levels of play, the batter scoring due to one or more errors by the defense is colloquially referred to as a Little League home run.

Though never an everyday occurrence, inside-the-park homers were more common in the early days of Major League Baseball (MLB). MLB has never set the standard shape or size of the outfield, and many early ballparks featured outfields that were large, irregular, or contained odd angles in the outfield wall to accommodate the size of the property on which they were situated. This could result in a batted ball getting past outfielders to the far reaches of the playing field or bouncing off a wall in an unexpected direction, forcing defensive players to chase after it while the batter sprints around the bases. The smaller and more circumferential outfields of the modern baseball era reduce opportunities for the ball to take odd bounces, helping to reduce the number of inside-the-park homers while increasing the number of &quot;regular&quot; homers. Today, inside-the-park homers are rare, generally totaling ten to twenty per season.

==Major League Baseball statistics==

Of the 154,483 home runs hit between 1951 and 2000, only 975 (0.63%; about one per 158) were inside-the-park. The percentage has dwindled since the increase in emphasis on power hitting, which began in the 1920s. Jesse Burkett, who played in the major leagues from 1890 to 1905, had 55 career inside-the-park home runs (of 75 career home runs). The leader in the live-ball era is Willie Wilson, who played in the major leagues from 1976 to 1994 and hit 13 inside-the-park home runs (of 41 career home runs).

===Rare occurrences===

*On July 13, 1896, Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit four home runs in one game (itself an extraordinarily rare feat), two of which were inside-the-park home runs. This event was the only time any homers in a four-homer game were inside-the-park.
*On April 27, 1949, Pete Milne hit an inside-the-park grand slam for his only career home run. It gave the New York Giants an 11–8 lead over the Brooklyn Dodgers, which was also the final score.
*On July 25, 1956, Roberto Clemente became the only MLB player to hit a walk-off inside-the-park grand slam in a 9–8 Pittsburgh Pirates win over the Chicago Cubs, at Forbes Field.
*On August 27, 1977, Texas Rangers teammates Toby Harrah and Bump Wills hit back-to-back inside the park home runs.
*Due to its proximity to Lake Ontario, Exhibition Stadium facilitated a weather-assisted three-run inside-the-park homer for Kelly Gruber of the Toronto Blue Jays when Detroit Tigers outfielders lost sight of a routine fly ball in thick fog in 1986. By the time the ball was located, it had landed behind the defenders, and Gruber was able to complete his circumnavigation of the bases before the ball was thrown back to the infield.
*On October 4, 1986, during a Twins&#x27; home game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, Greg Gagne tied a modern-era major league record by hitting two inside-the-park home runs against the Chicago White Sox. Only 18 players in major league history have performed this feat, with Gagne being just the second since 1930. Both home runs were hit off Chicago starting pitcher Floyd Bannister, who also tied a modern-era major league record by allowing two inside-the-park home runs in one game. The Twins went on to win the game, 7–3.
*On June 17, 2007, Prince Fielder of the Milwaukee Brewers hit a popup to center field that became an inside-the-park home run when Minnesota Twins outfielder Lew Ford lost the ball after it struck a speaker on the ceiling of the Metrodome. Fielder weighed at the time, becoming the third-heaviest player to hit an inside-the-park homer. On June 19, 2008, he hit another inside-the-park-homer at Miller Park in Milwaukee, versus the Toronto Blue Jays.
*In the 2007 All-Star Game, Ichiro Suzuki became the only player to hit an inside-the-park home run in an All-Star Game, hitting it at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. Suzuki, playing for the victorious American League All-Stars, earned Most Valuable Player honors.
*On April 6, 2009, Emilio Bonifacio of the Florida Marlins became the first player in 41 years to hit an inside-the-park home run on Opening Day, which was also the first home run of Bonifacio&#x27;s major league career.

*On August 18, 2009, Kyle Blanks of the San Diego Padres hit an inside-the-park home run against the Chicago Cubs. Weighing , he became the heaviest player to hit an inside-the-park home run.
*On July 18, 2010, Jhonny Peralta of the Cleveland Indians hit a three-run inside-the-park home run when Detroit Tigers outfielder Ryan Raburn crashed through the bullpen fence while trying to catch the ball. Peralta was one of the slowest runners then on the Indians&#x27; roster and would be traded to the Tigers ten days later. He took 16.74 seconds to round the bases, which was, at that point in the 2010 season, the slowest of any inside-the-park home run and slower than five regular home run trots.
*On May 25, 2013, Ángel Pagán of the San Francisco Giants hit an inside-the-park home run at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco against the Colorado Rockies. It was a tenth inning, two-run walk-off home run, with teammate Brandon Crawford on base. It was the first walk-off inside-the-park home run since 2004, when Rey Sanchez of the Devil Rays hit one, also in the bottom of the tenth inning, also against the Rockies, albeit in a tie game.
*On July 8, 2015, Logan Forsythe of the Tampa Bay Rays hit an inside-the-park home run in the 4th inning against the Kansas City Royals when, in attempting to field the ball, Royals left fielder Alex Gordon injured his groin. Gordon was replaced by Jarrod Dyson, who hit an inside-the-park home run of his own in the 6th inning of the game. Dyson&#x27;s hit went past Rays left fielder David DeJesus, who, like Gordon, had been injured five years earlier, on July 22, 2010, while playing for the Royals on a play that led to an inside-the-park home run for Derek Jeter.
*On September 2, 2015, Rubén Tejada of the New York Mets hit the ball down the right-field foul line, under the glove of Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Domonic Brown who, running full speed, crashed into and flipped over a short wall on the side of the playing field. While Brown was shaken up in the first row, the ball rolled out to the right field fence in Citi Field, where Phillies second baseman Cesar Hernández finally retrieved it, though it was too late to prevent Tejada from rounding the bases. Brown later left the game with concussion-like symptoms. At 74.5 mph off the bat, it was the softest-hit home run of the season to that point.
*On October 27, 2015, Alcides Escobar of the Kansas City Royals hit an inside-the-park home run in Game 1 of the 2015 World Series. It was the first in a World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans (now Red Sox) in .
*During the regionals for the 2022 College World Series, Louisiana Tech Bulldog catcher Jorge Corona hit a high fly ball to center field in a bases-loaded situation, with the Dallas Baptist Patriot centerfielder losing the ball in the lights of UFCU Disch–Falk Field, it bouncing well behind him to the wall and Corona easily clearing the bases standing up for an inside-the-park grand slam.
*On July 22, 2022, Raimel Tapia of the Toronto Blue Jays hit a high fly ball to center field with 2 outs and the bases loaded against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. Jarren Duran, the center fielder, lost sight of the ball in Fenway&#x27;s lights and it landed far behind him on the warning track, allowing Tapia to easily clear the bases giving him an inside-the-park grand slam. Toronto went on to score a franchise-record 28 runs in the game.
*On October 15, 2022, J. T. Realmuto of the Philadelphia Phillies hit an inside-the-park home run at Citizens Bank Park during a playoff game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming the first catcher to do so in postseason history.
*On August 8, 2023 Stuart Fairchild of the Cincinnati Reds hit a fly ball to right field with no outs in the 5th inning against the Miami Marlins at Great American Ball Park. Jesús Sánchez, the right fielder could not make the catch in foul territory and the ball landed against the wall and ran into the corner, Fairchild made the turn at 3rd base while a throw came in that bounced out of the catcher&#x27;s glove, allowing Fairchild to dive over the catcher and make the play at home.

<text>Vladimir Oskarovich Feltsman (, &quot;Vladimir Oskarovič Feltsman&quot; (born 8 January 1952) is a Russian-American classical pianist of Lithuanian Jewish descent particularly noted for his devotion to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and Frédéric Chopin.

==Background==

Vladimir Oskarovich Feltsman was born on January 8, 1952, in Moscow. His father, the composer Oscar Feltsman, was known in the Soviet Union for popular songs and musical comedies.

Vladimir Feltsman debuted with the Moscow Philharmonic at eleven (11) years of age. He studied at the Moscow Tchaikovsky, Moscow, and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) Conservatories. In 1971, he won the Grand Prix at the Marguerite Long International Piano Competition in Paris, followed by tours in the former Soviet Union, Europe, and Japan, thus beginning his adult career.

==Career==

In 1979, because of his growing discontent with the official Soviet ideology and rigid governmental control of the arts, Feltsman applied for an exit visa from the Soviet Union. In response, he was immediately banned from performing in public. After eight years of struggle and virtual artistic exile, he was finally granted permission to leave the Soviet Union.

Arriving in the United States on August 18, 1987, Vladimir Feltsman found himself warmly greeted at the White House, where on September 27, 1987, he performed his very first concert in North America for U.S. President Ronald Reagan. On November 11, 1987, his performance at Carnegie Hall established him as a major pianist on the American scene. During his early years in the West, he was promoted as a Russian Romantic firebrand, yet his debut recital consisted of works by Schubert, Schumann and Messiaen. By the mid-1990s, he had devoted himself to Bach, offering expressively shaped and thoughtfully ornamented performances on a modern piano. Then he returned to the standard repertory — Haydn, Beethoven, Mussorgsky — in the big-toned, blockbuster-style that many had anticipated when he first arrived in the USA. He has been described by music critics as a master of reinventing himself.

Feltsman teaches at the Mannes College The New School for Music and the State University of New York New Paltz, where he is the founder and artistic director of the International Festival-Institute Piano Summer. 
Feltsman has turned to performances on the fortepiano; he has notably performed all of Mozart&#x27;s piano sonatas on a fortepiano, as well as Beethoven&#x27;s Emperor Concerto and Mozart&#x27;s Concerto K595, No. 27. As his contribution to the Mozart anniversary year, he commissioned the keyboard builder Paul McNulty to construct a fortepiano modeled after an Anton Walter instrument from Mozart&#x27;s time.

==Personal==

He married a woman named Anna in 1977, and they had a son, Daniel, circa 1983. He was allowed to travel outside the Soviet Union after his marriage, though his wife was not allowed to accompany him, held as a de facto hostage so he would return.

In 1995, Feltsman became a U.S. citizen.

He lives in upstate New York with his Korean wife, Haewon.

==Works==

Feltsman&#x27;s discography includes six albums of clavier works of J.S. Bach, recordings of Beethoven&#x27;s last five piano sonatas, solo piano works of Franz Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Brahms, Olivier Messiaen, and Valentyn Sylvestrov, as well as concerti by Bach, Frédéric Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninov, and Sergei Prokofiev.

* 1967: First Prize, Concertina International Competition (Prague)
* 1971: Grand Prix, Marguerite Long Competition (Paris)

<doc id="643850" wikidata="Q1567203" url="?curid=643850" title="Down Periscope">
<text>Down Periscope is a 1996 American military comedy submarine film directed by David S. Ward, produced by Robert Lawrence, and starring Kelsey Grammer, Lauren Holly, and Rob Schneider along with Bruce Dern, Harry Dean Stanton, William H. Macy, and Rip Torn in supporting roles. Released by 20th Century Fox on March 1, 1996, the film focuses on Lieutenant Commander Thomas Dodge (played by Grammer), a capable (if somewhat unorthodox) U.S. Navy officer who fights to save his career after being saddled with a group of misfit seamen who have been brought together as the crew of his first command, USS &quot;Stingray&quot;, a rusty, obsolete World War II-era diesel submarine that is the focus of a special naval war game, supervised by a bitter rival (played by Dern) who is fighting to bury Dodge&#x27;s career by any means necessary.

==Plot==
Lieutenant Commander Thomas Dodge, currently the executive officer of the attack submarine USS &quot;Orlando&quot; under its commanding officer Commander Carl Knox, is being considered for a third time to captain a submarine. He has been previously rejected because of his unorthodox command methods that include a &quot;brushing&quot; incident with a Russian submarine near the port of Murmansk, Russia, and a genital tattoo reading &quot;Welcome Aboard&quot; that he acquired afterward while drunk on shore leave. If denied again, he will be dismissed from the Navy&#x27;s submarine command program.

Rear Admiral Yancy Graham, who dislikes Dodge, opposes his promotion, but Vice Admiral Dean Winslow, Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic, who likes Dodge and his methods, selects him to participate in a war game to test the Navy&#x27;s defenses against attack from diesel-powered submarines. As Russia has been selling off their diesel fleet to America&#x27;s adversaries, Winslow orders him to restore the rusty World War II-era diesel-powered submarine USS &quot;Stingray&quot;, assigned to him by Graham, and use it to &quot;invade&quot; Charleston Harbor undetected, and if successful, to sink a dummy warship in Norfolk Harbor with two live torpedoes. Though initially reluctant to participate, Dodge offers Winslow a wager: if he successfully completes both tasks, Winslow will give him a nuclear submarine to command. Winslow agrees to consider it, subtly instructing Dodge to &quot;think like a pirate&quot; instead of following the conventional war-game rules.

Graham, boasting that he has never lost a war game and motivated by his own ambition to obtain a third star, handpicks &quot;the crew from hell&quot; for &quot;Stingray&quot;: hot-tempered, uptight Lieutenant Martin G. Pascal as the executive officer; crusty civilian naval contractor Howard as the Chief Engineer; rebellious Engineman 1st Class Brad Stepanak; ultra-sharp-eared Sonar Technician 2nd Class E.T. &quot;Sonar&quot; Lovacelli; compulsive gambler Seaman Stanley &quot;Spots&quot; Sylvesterson; former losing college basketball player Seaman Jefferson &quot;Stoneball&quot; Jackson; shock-prone (and shock-addled) Electrician&#x27;s Mate Michael Nitro; and not-so-Culinary Specialist Second Class Buckman as &quot;Stingray&quot;″s cook. Additionally, Graham assigns a female Surface-qualified officer, Lieutenant Emily Lake as &quot;Stingray&quot;″s Diving Officer to see if women can successfully serve aboard submarines.

Using a storm off the Carolina coast as a diversion, Dodge and his crew offset their technological disadvantage by disguising the &quot;Stingray&quot; as a fishing trawler to infiltrate Charleston Harbor and set off signal flares. Upset at losing the first part of the war game and desperate to defeat Dodge, Graham halves the game&#x27;s containment area without Winslow&#x27;s authorization. Running into trouble on their first attempt at Norfolk Harbor, Dodge leaves the containment area and heads out to sea, breaking all contact with the Navy. Irate at this lapse in protocol, Pascal openly accuses him of hijacking his own boat and attempts to usurp him. &quot;Stingray&quot;″s crew, weary of Pascal&#x27;s berating and harassment, turn against him, and Dodge charges him with attempted mutiny. On deck, Lake witnesses Dodge and the crew, wearing makeshift buccaneer outfits and speaking like pirates, commit a mock execution by making a blindfolded Pascal walk the plank into the raised net of a waiting fishing trawler that will take him ashore.

During the &quot;Stingray&quot;″s second attempt at Norfolk, Graham, hellbent on stopping Dodge, assumes command of the &quot;Orlando&quot; from Knox. Dodge employs an incredibly dangerous maneuver: passing &quot;Stingray&quot; between the huge propellers of a commercial supertanker to avoid sonar detection by the naval ships and aircraft protecting the approach to Norfolk. By the time &quot;Orlando&quot; eventually locates, pursues, and targets the &quot;Stingray&quot;, Dodge has fired two live torpedoes at into a target ship anchored in Norfolk Harbor, thereby humiliating Graham and winning the war game.

After Dodge&#x27;s crew returns to port, Winslow chastises Graham and denies his promotion for attempting to undermine Dodge&#x27;s success. He then congratulates Dodge, informing him that he will now be given command of a new , along with a &quot;proper crew&quot; to man her. Dodge respectfully requests that his entire &quot;Stingray&quot; crew be transferred with him, to which Winslow agrees, also revealing that Stepanak is his son, despite having his mother&#x27;s surname. After Dodge dismisses his crew to begin a well-earned shore leave, Lake casually asks him as both of them leave the dock, &quot;What exactly is this tattoo I keep hearing about?&quot;.

==Production==
The name of the film is a play on the title of the 1959 World War II drama &quot;Up Periscope&quot; and spoofs several titles in the submarine film subgenre, including the Cold War drama &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

&quot;Down Periscope&quot; began shooting on May 6, 1995, and finished on July 27.

, a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine from World War II, now a museum ship and memorial in San Francisco, played the part of USS &quot;Stingray&quot;. The nearby Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet stood in for Naval Station Norfolk.

The film makes use of both standard US Navy stock footage and scenes shot specifically for the film. The target ship that is torpedoed and sunk, ending the film&#x27;s war game, is both naval stock footage of the and a prop shooting miniature. &quot;Fletcher&quot; was one of the most decorated ships in US Navy history. Over the closing credits, a music video is shown of the Village People and the film&#x27;s cast performing &quot;In the Navy&quot; aboard &quot;Stingray&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Down Periscope&quot; had its US theatrical release on March 1, 1996. The film grossed $25,785,603 domestically and $37,553,752 worldwide. The film was released on home video five months later, on August 6, 1996.

==Reception== 
On the review aggregator website &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, the film has a score of 11% from 35 reviews, with an average rating 4.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Down Periscope&quot; takes audiences on an aimless voyage for aquatic hijinks, proving there really aren&#x27;t any effective substitutes for a well-written script.&quot; On Metacritic, the film receive a score of 39 based on 18 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The makers of &quot;Police Academy&quot; and &quot;Major League&quot; team up to take on the submarine corps [...] and the result is a testosterone comedy that’s crude fun, with a pinch of corn-pone morality. It’s good-natured, innocuous frivolity that should raise a few smiles...&quot; However, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt, &quot;The tone of the acting, which is set by Mr. Grammer&#x27;s blandly laid-back performance, is all wrong for a genre that demands over-the-top hamming&quot;. Holden also wrote that the film does manage to provide &quot;a couple of amusing bits&quot;, but &quot;The energy level of &quot;Down Periscope&quot; is so low that moments like these, which should flare hilariously, reach a wan flicker&quot;.

<doc id="643854" wikidata="Q3487646" url="?curid=643854" title="Bourgeois nationalism">
<text>In Marxist theory, bourgeois nationalism is the ideology of the ruling capitalist class which aims to overcome class antagonism between proletariat and bourgeoisie by appealing to national unity. It is seen as a distraction from engaging in class struggle and an attempt to impose interests of capitalists on the proletariat by constructing capitalist interests as &quot;national interests&quot;. Internationally, it aims to create antagonism between workers of different nations and serves as a divide-and-conquer strategy. The bourgeois nationalism is contrasted with left-wing nationalism and proletarian internationalism.
== Usage ==

=== Soviet Union ===
After the October Revolution, the Bolshevik government based its nationalities policy (korenization) on the principles of Marxism. According to these principles, all nations should disappear with time, and nationalism was considered a bourgeois ideology. By the mid-1930s these policies were replaced with more extreme assimilationist and Russification policies. The term was used indiscriminately to smear national groups opposed to Russian centralism.

In his Report on the 50th anniversary of the formation of the USSR, Leonid Brezhnev emphasized: &quot;That is why Communists and all fighters for socialism believe that the main aspect of the national question is unification of the working people, regardless of their national origin, in the common battle against every type of oppression, and for a new social system which rules out exploitation of the working people.&quot;

In the Soviet Union throughout its existence, the term generally referred to Ukrainian, Estonian, Latvian, Armenian, Kazakh and other types of nationalism that were propagated by the Soviet Union&#x27;s non-Russian minorities. The Soviet leadership saw their struggle for independence as a threat to the entire existence of the USSR&#x27;s communist regime.

=== China ===

Bourgeois nationalism as a concept was discussed by China&#x27;s president, Liu Shaoqi as follows:
===Jews and Zionism===
In 1949, the Communist Party USA declared the Zionist movement to be a form of &quot;Jewish bourgeois nationalism&quot;.

Writing for People&#x27;s World, the leftist activist John Gilman referred to Jewish bourgeoisie nationalism as having multiple varieties, including Jewish assimilationism and Zionism.

<doc id="643857" wikidata="Q3538399" url="?curid=643857" title="Trekking peak">
<text>The term &quot;Trekking Peak&quot; is a commonly misunderstood colloquial term which may refer to a variety of types of peaks in the Himalayan Region. The term is most often associated with Group &quot;B&quot; NMA Climbing Peaks classified by the Nepal Mountaineering Association or easier. Some may use the term &quot;Trekking Peak&quot; to solely describe peaks requiring little to no technical climbing experience. Others may use the term to describe all mountains regulated by the Nepal Mountaineering Association including Group &quot;A&quot; NMA Expedition Peaks which may require considerable difficulties and technical climbing skill.

Because of the term&#x27;s loose classification of peaks it can be misleading, encompassing peaks of significant varying difficulties. There is less general consensus for the use of the term in this context of Group &quot;A&quot; NMA Expedition Peaks.

==Nepal==
Fifteen peaks classified as Group &quot;B&quot; NMA Climbing Peaks are generally considered &quot;trekking&quot; peaks. These peaks do not exceed in elevation and can be reasonably climbed from a base camp with the possible use of a high camp. To be climbed, these peaks typically require an amount of mountaineering experience and skills and the use of specialized mountaineering equipment, such as crampons and ice axes. The easiest routes to the summits of these mountains are all challenging enough to warrant a mountaineering difficulty grade by the International French Adjectival System. The Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal also calls several Group A peaks &quot;trekking peaks&quot; but these are considerably more difficult despite being lower than 7000 meters. The fees for Group A peaks are higher than Group B peaks as are others costs and the time required.

In Nepal there are numerous peaks that require no technical expertise to climb, which may also be considered trekking peaks. These peaks are not tracked by the Nepal Mountaineering Association. Many of these peaks see a substantial number of summits each year by hikers and trekkers in the region without the use of specialized equipment. The routes to the summits of these mountains may not be challenging enough to warrant a mountaineering difficulty grade by the International French Adjectival System.

==India==
The Indian Mountaineering Foundation defines trekking peaks as mountains that require technical mountaineering skills and equipment but are still climbable by &quot;trekkers&quot; who have some experience or obtain training. Climbers are not required to obtain permits from or pay royalties to the Indian Mountaineering Foundation. However, some peaks are located near the military line of control, meaning close to borders of neighboring countries and permission and permits may be required from local civil or army authorities for security reasons. Also, some peaks may be out of reach for foreign climbers.

The Indian Mountaineering Foundation has designated 3 trekking peaks in the Indian Himalayan Region.

<text>Levitation or transvection, in the paranormal or religious context, is the claimed ability to raise a human body or other object into the air by mystical means. 

While believed in some religious and New Age communities to occur due to supernatural, miraculous, psychic, or &quot;energetic&quot; phenomena, there is no scientific evidence of levitation occurring. Alleged cases of levitation can usually be explained by deception and fraud, such as trickery, illusion, and hallucination.

==Religious views==
Various religions have claimed examples of levitation amongst their followers. This is generally used either as a demonstration of the validity or power of the religion, or as evidence of the holiness or adherence to the religion of the particular levitator.

===Buddhism===
* It is recounted as one of the Miracles of Buddha that Gautama Buddha &quot;walked on water&quot; levitating (crossed legs) over a stream in order to convert a brahmin to Buddhism.
*Yogi Milarepa, a Vajrayana Buddhist guru, was rumored to have possessed a range of additional abilities during levitation, such as the ability to walk, rest and sleep; however, such were deemed as occult powers.

===Christianity===

* According to three gospels, Jesus walked on the water of Lake Galilee to meet his disciples who were in a boat.
* Saint Mary of Egypt (), walked across the river Jordan according to her hagiographer, the hermit Zosimas of Palestine
* Saint Bessarion of Egypt (died ), is said to have walked across the waters of the river Nile
* Francis of Assisi ( – 1226), founder of the Franciscan Order, is recorded as having been &quot;suspended above the earth, often to a height of three, and often to a height of four cubits&quot;. This is about .
* Saint Catherine of Siena (1347–1380), a nun of the Third Order of Saint Dominic and Doctor of the Church, was said to have levitated while in prayer, and a priest claimed to have seen the Holy Communion&#x27;s Eucharist wafer flying from his hand straight to Catherine&#x27;s hand.
* Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582), a Carmelite nun and Doctor of the Church, claimed to have levitated at a height of about a for an extended period somewhat less than an hour, in a state of mystical rapture. She called the experience a &quot;spiritual visitation&quot;.
* Saint Martín de Porres (1579–1639), a lay brother of the Dominican Order, claimed psychic powers of bilocation, being able to pass through closed doors (teleportation), and levitation.
* Joseph of Cupertino (1603–1663), a Franciscan Friar, reportedly levitated high in the air, for extended periods of more than an hour, on many occasions.
* Alphonsus Liguori (1696–1787), when preaching at Foggia, was purportedly lifted before the eyes of the whole congregation several feet from the ground.
* Girolamo Savonarola, sentenced to death, allegedly rose off the floor of his cell into midair and remained there for some time.
* Seraphim of Sarov (1759–1833), Russian Orthodox saint, allegedly had a gift to levitate over the ground for some time, witnessed by many educated people of his time, including the emperor Alexander I of Russia.
* Mariam Baouardy (; or &quot;Mary of Jesus Crucified&quot;, 1846–1878), a Discalced Carmelite nun of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, experienced frequent ecstasies. She was purportedly seen levitating more than once by others: for example, in the garden of the monastery during times of private prayer, when living in the Carmelite monastery at Pau, in France.

;&quot;Demonic&quot; levitation in Christianity
* Simon Magus is recorded in the &quot;Acts of Peter&quot; as levitating above the Forum in Rome in order to prove himself to be a god. The apostle Peter intervenes, causing Magus to drop from the sky, breaking his legs &quot;in three parts&quot;.
* Clara Germana Cele, a young South African girl, in 1906 reportedly levitated in a rigid position. The effect was apparently only reversed by the application of Holy water, leading to belief that it was caused by demonic possession.
* Magdalena de la Cruz (1487–1560), a Franciscan nun of Cordova, Spain.
* Margaret Rule, a young Boston girl in the 1690s who was believed to be harassed by evil forces shortly after the Salem Witchcraft Trials, reportedly levitated from her bed in the presence of a number of witnesses.

===Gnosticism===
*Simon Magus, a Gnostic who claimed to be an incarnation of God (as conceived by the Gnostics), reportedly had the ability to levitate, along with many other magical powers.
*Mani, founder of Manichaeism, was reputed to be able to levitate.

===Hellenism===
*It was believed in Hellenism (the pagan religion of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome) on the testimony of Philostratus that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana underwent heavenly assumption by levitating into Elysium.

===Hinduism===

*In Hinduism, it is believed that some Hindu mystics and gurus who have achieved certain spiritual powers (called siddhis) are able to levitate. In Sanskrit, the power of levitation is called &quot;laghiman&quot; (&#x27;lightness&#x27;) or &quot;dardura-siddhi&quot; (the &#x27;frog power&#x27;). Yogananda&#x27;s book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; has accounts of Hindu Yogis who levitated in the course of their meditation.
*Yogi Subbayah Pullavar was reported to have levitated into the air for four minutes in front of a crowd of 150 witnesses on June 6, 1936. He was seen suspended horizontally several feet above the ground, in a trance, lightly resting his hand on top of a cloth-covered stick. Pullavar&#x27;s arms and legs could not be bent from their locked position once on the ground. The illusion was created by a simple method in which the person seen to levitate is supported by a cantilevered platform held up by an iron rod camouflaged in some way.

==Levitation by mediums==

Many mediums have claimed to have levitated during séances, especially in the 19th century in Britain and America. Many have been shown to be frauds, using wires and stage magic tricks. Daniel Dunglas Home, a prolific and well-documented levitator of himself and other objects, was said by spiritualists to levitate outside a window. Skeptics have disputed such claims. The researchers Joseph McCabe and Trevor H. Hall exposed the &quot;levitation&quot; of Home as nothing more than him moving across a connecting ledge between two iron balconies.

The magician Joseph Rinn gave a full account of fraudulent behavior observed in a séance of Eusapia Palladino and explained how her levitation trick had been performed. Milbourne Christopher summarized the exposure:

:&quot;Joseph F. Rinn and Warner C. Pyne, clad in black coveralls, had crawled into the dining room of Columbia professor Herbert G. Lord&#x27;s house while a Palladino seance was in progress. Positioning themselves under the table, they saw the medium&#x27;s foot strike a table leg to produce raps. As the table tilted to the right, due to pressure of her right hand on the surface, they saw her put her left foot under the left table leg. Pressing down on the tabletop with her left hand and up with her left foot under the table leg to form a clamp, she lifted her foot and &quot;levitated&quot; the table from the floor.&quot;

The levitation trick of the medium Jack Webber was exposed by the magician Julien Proskauer. According to Proskauer he would use a telescopic reaching rod attached to a trumpet to levitate objects in the séance room. The physicist Edmund Edward Fournier d&#x27;Albe investigated the medium Kathleen Goligher at many sittings and concluded that no paranormal phenomena such as levitation had occurred with Goligher and stated he had found evidence of fraud. D&#x27;Albe had claimed the ectoplasm substance in the photographs of Goligher from her séances were made from muslin.

==In photography==
A person photographed while bouncing may appear to be levitating. This optical illusion is used by religious groups and by spiritualist mediums, claiming that their meditation techniques allow them to levitate in the air. Usually telltale signs can be found in the photography indicating that the subject was in the act of bouncing, like blurry body parts, a flailing scarf, hair being suspended in the air, etc.

<text>The Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) is the national mountaineering association of Nepal. The NMA was founded in 1973 with the goals of promoting mountaineering activities in the Himalaya, providing safety awareness and mountaineering skills to Nepalese mountaineers and creating awareness of the beauty of the Himalayas both nationally and in international communities. The NMA is an active member of the UIAA since 1975. 

The NMA was also responsible for administering climbing permits for 27 mountains with altitudes between 5,800 metres and 6,600 metres categorised as trekking peaks, while permits for all other mountains open for climbing in Nepal (approximately 300 peaks) are issued by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoTCA). In October 2015 the Government of Nepal announced that responsibility for the trekking peaks would be transferred from NMA to MoTCA.

<doc id="643866" wikidata="Q1062113" url="?curid=643866" title="NetBurst">
<text>The NetBurst microarchitecture, called P68 inside Intel, was the successor to the P6 microarchitecture in the x86 family of central processing units (CPUs) made by Intel. The first CPU to use this architecture was the Willamette-core Pentium 4, released on November 20, 2000 and the first of the Pentium 4 CPUs; all subsequent Pentium 4 and Pentium D variants have also been based on NetBurst. In mid-2001, Intel released the &quot;Foster&quot; core, which was also based on NetBurst, thus switching the Xeon CPUs to the new architecture as well. Pentium 4-based Celeron CPUs also use the NetBurst architecture.

NetBurst was replaced with the Core microarchitecture based on P6, released in July 2006.

== Technology ==
The NetBurst microarchitecture includes features such as Hyper-threading, Hyper Pipelined Technology, Rapid Execution Engine, Execution Trace Cache, and replay system which all were introduced for the first time in this particular microarchitecture, and some never appeared again afterwards.

===Hyper-threading===

Hyper-threading is Intel&#x27;s proprietary simultaneous multithreading (SMT) implementation used to improve parallelization of computations (doing multiple tasks at once) performed on x86 processors. Intel introduced it with NetBurst processors in 2002. Later Intel reintroduced it in the Nehalem microarchitecture after its absence in the Core 2.

=== Quad-Pumped Front-Side Bus ===
The Northwood and Willamette cores feature an external Front Side Bus (FSB) that runs at 100 MHz which transfers four bits per clock cycle, thus having an effective speed of 400 MHz. Later revisions of the Northwood core, along with the Prescott core (and derivatives) have an effective 800 MHz front-side bus (200 MHz quad pumped). 

=== Hyper-Pipelined Technology ===
The Willamette and Northwood cores contain a 20-stage instruction pipeline. This is a significant increase in the number of stages compared to the Pentium III, which had only 10 stages in its pipeline. The Prescott core increased the length of the pipeline to 31 stages. A drawback of longer pipelines is the increase in the number of stages that need to be traced back in the event of a branch misprediction, increasing the penalty of said misprediction. To address this issue, Intel devised the Rapid Execution Engine and has invested a great deal into its branch prediction technology, which Intel claims reduces branch mispredictions by 33% over Pentium III. In reality, the longer pipeline resulted in reduced efficiency through a lower number of instructions per clock (IPC) executed as high enough clock speeds were not able to be reached to offset lost performance due to larger than expected increase in power consumption and heat.

=== Rapid Execution Engine ===
With this technology, the two arithmetic logic units (ALUs) in the core of the CPU are double-pumped, meaning that they actually operate at twice the core clock frequency. For example, in a 3.8 GHz processor, the ALUs will effectively be operating at 7.6 GHz. The reason behind this is to generally make up for the low IPC count; additionally this considerably enhances the integer performance of the CPU. Intel also replaced the high-speed barrel shifter with a shift/rotate execution unit that operates at the same frequency as the CPU core. The downside is that certain instructions are now much slower (relatively and absolutely) than before, making optimization for multiple target CPUs difficult. An example is shift and rotate operations, which suffer from the lack of a barrel shifter which was present on every x86 CPU beginning with the i386, including the main competitor processor, Athlon.

=== Execution Trace Cache ===

Within the L1 cache of the CPU, Intel incorporated its Execution Trace Cache. It stores decoded micro-operations, so that when executing a new instruction, instead of fetching and decoding the instruction again, the CPU directly accesses the decoded micro-ops from the trace cache, thereby saving considerable time. Moreover, the micro-ops are cached in their predicted path of execution, which means that when instructions are fetched by the CPU from the cache, they are already present in the correct order of execution. Intel later introduced a similar but simpler concept with Sandy Bridge called micro-operation cache (UOP cache).

=== Replay system ===

The replay system is a subsystem within the Intel Pentium 4 processor to catch operations that have been mistakenly sent for execution by the processor&#x27;s scheduler. Operations caught by the replay system are then re-executed in a loop until the conditions necessary for their proper execution have been fulfilled.

=== Branch prediction hints ===
The Intel NetBurst architecture allows branch prediction hints to be inserted into the code to tell whether the static prediction should be taken or not taken, while this feature was abandoned in later Intel processors. According to Intel, NetBurst&#x27;s branch prediction algorithm is 33% better than the one in P6.

== Scaling-up issues ==
Despite these enhancements, the NetBurst architecture created obstacles for engineers trying to scale up its performance. With this microarchitecture, Intel planned to attain clock speeds of 10 GHz, but because of rising clock speeds, Intel faced increasing problems with keeping power dissipation within acceptable limits. Intel reached a speed barrier of 3.8 GHz in November 2004 but encountered problems trying to achieve even that. Intel abandoned NetBurst in 2006 after the heat problems became unacceptable and then developed the Core microarchitecture, inspired by the P6 Core of the Pentium Pro to the &quot;Tualatin&quot; Pentium III-S, and most directly the Pentium M.

== Revisions ==

Intel replaced the original &quot;Willamette&quot; core with a redesigned version of the NetBurst microarchitecture called &quot;Northwood&quot; in January 2002. The &quot;Northwood&quot; design combined an increased cache size, a smaller 130 nm fabrication process, and Hyper-threading (although initially all models but the 3.06 GHz model had this feature disabled) to produce a more modern, higher-performing version of the NetBurst microarchitecture.

In February 2004, Intel introduced Prescott, a more radical revision of the microarchitecture. The &quot;Prescott&quot; core was produced on a 90 nm process, and included several major design changes, including the addition of an even larger cache (from 512 KB in the &quot;Northwood&quot; to 1 MB, and 2 MB in Prescott 2M), a much deeper instruction pipeline (31 stages as compared to 20 in the &quot;Northwood&quot;), a heavily improved branch predictor, the introduction of the SSE3 instructions, and later, the implementation of Intel Extended Memory 64 Technology (EM64T), Intel&#x27;s branding for their compatible implementation of the x86-64 64-bit version of the x86 microarchitecture (as with hyper-threading, all &quot;Prescott&quot; chips branded Pentium 4 HT have hardware to support this feature, but it was initially only enabled on the high-end Xeon processors, before being officially introduced in processors with the Pentium trademark). Power consumption and heat dissipation also became major issues with &quot;Prescott&quot;, which quickly became the hottest-running, and most power-hungry, of Intel&#x27;s single-core x86 and x86-64 processors. Power and heat concerns prevented Intel from releasing a Prescott clocked above 3.8 GHz, along with a mobile version of the core clocked above 3.46 GHz.

Intel also released a dual-core processor based on the NetBurst microarchitecture branded Pentium D. The first Pentium D core was codenamed &quot;Smithfield&quot;, which is actually two Prescott cores in a single die, and later &quot;Presler&quot;, which consists of two &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; cores on two separate dies (&quot;Cedar Mill&quot; being the 65 nm die-shrink of &quot;Prescott&quot;).

== Roadmap ==
== Successor ==
Intel had NetBurst-based successors in development called Tejas and Jayhawk with between 40 and 50 pipeline stages, but ultimately decided to replace NetBurst with the Core microarchitecture, released in July 2006; these successors were more directly derived from the Pentium Pro (P6 microarchitecture). August 8, 2008 marked the end of Intel NetBurst-based processors. The reason for NetBurst&#x27;s abandonment was the severe heat problems caused by high clock speeds. While some Core- and Nehalem-based processors have higher TDPs, most processors are multi-core, so each core gives off a fraction of the maximum TDP, and the highest-clocked Core-based single-core processors give off a maximum of 27 W of heat. The fastest-clocked desktop Pentium 4 processors (single-core) had TDPs of 115 W, compared to 88 W for the fastest clocked mobile versions. Although, with the introduction of new steppings, TDPs for some models were eventually lowered.

The Nehalem microarchitecture, the successor to the Core microarchitecture, was supposed to be an evolution of NetBurst according to Intel roadmaps dating back to 2000. Nehalem reimplements certain features of NetBurst, including the Hyper-Threading technology first introduced in the 3.06 GHz &quot;Northwood&quot; core, and L3 cache, first implemented on a consumer processor in the &quot;Gallatin&quot; core used in the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition.

<text>ALIWEB (Archie-Like Indexing for the Web) is the first Web search engine.

First announced in November 1993 by developer Martijn Koster while working at Nexor, and presented in May 1994 at the First International Conference on the World Wide Web at CERN in Geneva, ALIWEB preceded WebCrawler by several months.

ALIWEB allows users to submit the locations of index files on their sites which enables the search engine to include webpages and add user-written page descriptions and keywords. This empowers webmasters to define the terms that would lead users to their pages, and also avoided setting bots (&quot;e.g.&quot; the Wanderer, JumpStation) which used up bandwidth. 

Martijn Koster, who was also instrumental in the creation of the Robots Exclusion Standard, detailed the background and objectives of ALIWEB with an overview of its functions and framework in the paper he presented at CERN. Koster left Nexor and in the following years development ceased until a new company took over the project. It was discovered that the database file had actually exceeded the range of search so therefore when you entered a search term it would not search the entire database and weight the results, it would only search from the beginning of the database until it either ran out of results to show or exceeded the number of results requested. The new company developers fixed this by weighting the results and searching the entire database before displaying the results.

<doc id="643884" wikidata="Q1581362" url="?curid=643884" title="The Grand Wazoo">
<text>The Grand Wazoo is the eleventh album by The Mothers, sixteenth overall by Frank Zappa, released in November 1972. It was written and recorded during Zappa&#x27;s period of convalescence after being assaulted in December 1971 in London, UK.

==Overview==
Along with its predecessor &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot; (July 1972), this album represents Zappa&#x27;s foray into big band music, the logical progression from &quot;Hot Rats&quot; (1969) (which used a much smaller lineup). This was the last release on Zappa&#x27;s own Bizarre Records label.

==Recording and production==
This was the second Zappa album released in a period where he needed to use a wheelchair. Zappa was unable to tour after being assaulted and pushed offstage into an orchestra pit during a concert on December 10, 1971, at the Rainbow Theatre in London, UK.

The album is mostly made up of instrumental pieces, similar in style to those of three previous albums: &quot;Hot Rats&quot; (October 1969), &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; (February 1970), and &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot; (July 1972).

==Track listing==
All songs written, composed and arranged by Frank Zappa.

<doc id="643886" wikidata="Q796122" url="?curid=643886" title="Chet Huntley">
<text>Chester Robert &quot;Chet&quot; Huntley (December 10, 1911 – March 20, 1974) was an American television newscaster, best known for co-anchoring NBC&#x27;s evening news program, &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report,&quot; for 14 years beginning in 1956.

==Early life==
Huntley was born in Cardwell, Montana, the only son and eldest of four children born to Percy Adams Huntley and Blanche Wadine (née Tatham) Huntley. The family was of Scottish descent. His father was a telegraph operator for the Northern Pacific Railway, and young Chet was born in the Cardwell depot living quarters. Owing to the railroad&#x27;s seniority system, wherein employees with longer tenure could &quot;bump&quot; newer employees, the family moved often. They lived in Cardwell, Saco, Willow Creek, Logan, Big Timber, Norris, Whitehall, and Three Forks while he was a child.

He graduated from Whitehall High School in Whitehall, and attended Montana State College in Bozeman, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He attended Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle before graduating from the University of Washington in 1934, with a degree in speech and drama.

==Career==
Huntley began his radio newscast career in 1934 at Seattle&#x27;s KIRO AM, later working on radio stations in Spokane (KHQ) and Portland. His time (1936–37) in Portland was with KGW-AM, owned by &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, a Portland daily newspaper. At KGW he was writer, newscaster, and announcer. In 1937 he went to work for KFI in Los Angeles, moving to CBS Radio from 1939 to 1951, then ABC Radio from 1951 to 1955. In 1955, he joined the NBC Radio network, viewed by network executives as &quot;another Ed Murrow&quot;.

In 1956, coverage of the national political party conventions was a major point of pride for the fledgling broadcast news organizations. NBC News executives were seeking to counter the growing popularity of CBS&#x27; Walter Cronkite, who had been a ratings success at the 1952 conventions. They decided to replace their current news anchor, John Cameron Swayze, but there was a disagreement on who the new anchorman should be. The two leading contenders were Huntley and David Brinkley. The eventual decision was to have both men share the assignment. Their on-air chemistry was apparent from the start, with Huntley&#x27;s straightforward presentation countered by Brinkley&#x27;s acerbic wit.

This success soon led to the team replacing Swayze on the network&#x27;s nightly news program. It was decided to have the two men co-anchor the show; Huntley from New York City, Brinkley from Washington, D.C. &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; began in October 1956 and was soon a ratings success. Huntley and Brinkley&#x27;s catchphrase closing of &quot;Good night, Chet&quot;—&quot;Good night, David... and good night for NBC News&quot; was developed by the show&#x27;s producer, Reuven Frank. Although both anchors initially disliked it, the sign-off became famous. Huntley and Brinkley gained great celebrity themselves, with surveys showing them better known than John Wayne, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart or the Beatles. The gregarious Huntley remained the same, a friend commenting in 1968 that &quot;Chet is warm, he&#x27;s friendly, he&#x27;s unaffected, he&#x27;s—well, he&#x27;s just so damned nice.&quot;

In April 1956, before that year&#x27;s political conventions that brought him to prominence, Huntley began anchoring a new half-hour program entitled &quot;Outlook&quot;, produced by Reuven Frank. The program aired for seven years, later changing its name to Chet Huntley Reporting. It often covered racial segregation and civil rights.  In January 1962, the program moved from the Sunday evening news time slot to prime time.

Huntley wrote a memoir of his Montana childhood, &quot;The Generous Years: Remembrances of a Frontier Boyhood&quot;, published by Random House in 1968. He also became involved in a New York advertising agency, Levine, Huntley, Schmidt, Plapler &amp; Beaver, gaining a 10 percent share in the agency in exchange for having his name on the letterhead and attending some agency meetings. He maintained his own cattle farm in Stockton, New Jersey, which for a short time in 1964 included a beef line from the farm&#x27;s cattle promoted under his name before the network intervened due to conflict of interest and promotional concerns.

Huntley&#x27;s last NBC News broadcast was aired on Friday, July 31, 1970. He returned to Montana, where he conceived and built Big Sky, a ski resort south of Bozeman, which opened in December 1973.

==Marriage==

Huntley&#x27;s first marriage, to Ingrid Rolin, produced two daughters and ended in divorce in 1959. Later that year, Huntley, at age 48, married the former Tipton &quot;Tippy&quot; Stringer (1930–2010).

== Death ==
Huntley died of lung cancer on March 20, 1974, at his home in Big Sky at the age of 62, three days before the opening ceremonies for Big Sky. Huntley was honored with a cenotaph at Soldiers Chapel on the grounds of the Big Sky Resort. Boyne USA Resorts purchased the Big Sky Resort in 1976 and has owned and managed it since. Huntley was buried at Sunset Hills Cemetery in Bozeman, Montana, 50 miles east of his hometown of Cardwell, Montana.

==Accolades==
In 1956 Huntley received the Alfred I. duPont Award.

In 1988, Huntley was posthumously inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==
Only days before his retirement, Huntley gave an interview with Dick Cavett, available on the DVD &quot;The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons&quot;, Disc 2. On that broadcast, he described his political views as conservative on economic issues, but liberal on social issues. However, he stated to Cavett and the other guests that he took pains to ensure that his personal views did not adversely affect his reporting during his years as a journalist.

In 2003, a biography titled &quot;Good Night Chet,&quot; by Lyle Johnston, was published by McFarland Publishers.

<doc id="643887" wikidata="Q6132272" url="?curid=643887" title="James Dallas Egbert III">
<text>James Dallas Egbert III (October 29, 1962 – August 16, 1980) was a student at Michigan State University who disappeared for about a month from his dormitory room on August 15, 1979. The disappearance was widely reported by newspapers and possibly other media, but it was never explained. Egbert&#x27;s participation in the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was seized upon by investigators and journalists alike as being possibly related to his disappearance, which propelled the previously obscure game to nationwide attention.

==Background==
Egbert was born in Dayton, Ohio, and grew up in Huber Heights, a Dayton suburb, attending Wayne High School. He was a child prodigy, and entered Michigan State University at age 16, where he majored in computer science. Personal problems cited in the reports of his suicide attempt and disappearance include depression, loneliness, parental pressure, drug addiction, and (according to the private detective who would later search for him) difficulty in coming to terms with his homosexuality.

==Disappearance==
Egbert left his dormitory room at Case Hall on August 15, 1979, after writing a suicide note, and entered the university&#x27;s steam tunnels. He consumed some methaqualone, intending to commit suicide, but he survived. He woke up the next day and went into hiding at a friend&#x27;s house. Gen Con XII, a convention dedicated to table-top role playing, began that day in Wisconsin, and some attendees reported that they had seen him there. Meanwhile, a police search for Egbert began.

On August 22, Egbert&#x27;s parents hired William Dear, a private investigator who was an acquaintance of Egbert&#x27;s uncle, to help locate their son. According to Dear, in their first conversation Egbert&#x27;s mother raised the possibility that her son had committed suicide, and complained that Michigan State had not notified them that their son was missing until August 20, five days after he was last seen.

On August 24, Michael Stuart, a journalist for the university&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The State News&quot;, published details of the case, including the assertion by an anonymous friend of Egbert&#x27;s that the missing student was &quot;known to leave campus before for destinations unknown&quot;. Stuart&#x27;s article prompted growing media interest in Egbert&#x27;s disappearance.

After Dear learned that Egbert had played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, he publicly amplified police theories that Egbert&#x27;s disappearance was linked to the game. Students were said to play live-action sessions of the game in the steam maintenance tunnels below the campus, and it was speculated that Egbert had entered the tunnels and had either been injured or lost his way. This alleged connection of the role-playing game to Egbert&#x27;s disappearance prompted what some Michigan State University students and faculty thought was sensationalist coverage of both Egbert and the game in media outlets throughout the United States. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was described by some journalists as a &quot;bizarre and secretive cult&quot; that players could only join &quot;by invitation&quot;.

The search for Egbert continued unsuccessfully for several weeks. It was later learned that during this time Egbert moved between two other houses in East Lansing, and then finally left the city via bus for New Orleans.

While he was in New Orleans, Egbert made a second suicide attempt by consuming a cyanide compound. This attempt also failed. He then moved on to Morgan City, Louisiana, where he found employment as &quot;a laborer at an oil field&quot;, according to a 2014 online article by Jason Louv. After only four days on the job, Egbert, aware that Dear was searching for him, telephoned Dear and gave him his location. Dear traveled to Louisiana (other sources reported Texas) and recovered Egbert. Upon meeting the investigator, Egbert asked him not to disclose what he had learned about his whereabouts in the preceding weeks. Dear agreed and released Egbert, who was still legally a juvenile, into the custody of his uncle Marvin Gross on September 13, 1979.

==Later life and death==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its obituary for Egbert, summarized the subsequent phase of his life. &quot;Dallas Egbert transferred last year from Michigan State to Wright State University&quot;—near his parents&#x27; home in Dayton—&quot;where he continued to study computer systems until he dropped out last April [1980]. Since then, he had been working in an optical store run by his father.&quot;

On August 11, 1980, almost a year after his story garnered national attention, Egbert, age 17, was admitted to Grandview Hospital in Dayton with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, during the five days that followed, his parents were informed that he had no chance of survival, and they &quot;gave the hospital permission to make various organs available for transplants. The hospital used a computer network to find recipients... the hospital spokesman said that organs would go to patients in several states, including New Jersey.&quot; Egbert died on August 16, 1980. &quot;The youth&#x27;s death came in mid-afternoon,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; continued, &quot;but the hospital did not confirm it until 10:30 P.M. Max Peterson, a spokesman for the hospital, said that the confirmation had been delayed for notification of family members.&quot; In a book authored by Dear years later, he recalls visiting Egbert&#x27;s bedside during the five days of hospitalization, and feeling horrified that a juvenile with so much intelligence was brain dead and connected to life support. 

Regarding the period in the previous year when Egbert&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown, &quot;The New York Times&quot; added, &quot;The circumstances of the disappearance have never been explained, and Mr. Dear and the parents have refused to give details. Since last Monday [August 11] the parents, Anna and James Dallas Egbert 2d, have declined to make comments of any kind.&quot;

==Legacy==
William Dear declined to comment to journalists in 1980. In 1984, he authored the book &quot;The Dungeon Master: The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III&quot;, published in hardback by Houghton Mifflin and in paperback by Random House in 1985. In the book, Dear tells Egbert&#x27;s story.

The idea of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; players acting out real-life sessions in dangerous locations like the steam tunnels and losing touch with reality became ingrained into the cultural consciousness, inspiring books and movies such as &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot;. The perceived link between Egbert&#x27;s disappearance and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was one of several controversies linked to the game during the 1980s. The publicity surrounding the &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; novel and film heightened the public&#x27;s unease regarding role-playing games. However, it also increased the sales of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game manuals considerably, adding to the game&#x27;s success. For example, &quot;sales of the &quot;Basic Set&quot; rose dramatically. Right before the steam tunnel incident, the &quot;Basic Set&quot; might have sold 5,000 copies a month. By the end of 1979, it was trading over 30,000 copies per month, and only going up from there&quot;.

<text>The Banu Sumadih () were an 11th-century Arab dynasty that ruled the Moorish Taifa of Almería (present day Almería province, Spain) in Al-Andalus. The family also produced several renowned poets, including Umm Al-Kiram.

==Dynasty==
The Banu Sumadih family were a branch of the Banu Tujib of the Upper March. A former military leader under Almanzor, Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Sumadih, was ruling as governor of Huesca during the reign of his distant cousin, al-Mundir I (ruled 1018–1021) of the Taifa of Zaragoza, but ran afoul of his emir and al-Mundir attacked him and forced him into exile in the Taifa of Valencia. His son Ma&#x27;n ibn Muhammad was appointed governor of Almería by the Valencia emir, &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Aziz ibn Amir, in 1038, but in 1041 elevated Almería into an independent taifa. His dynasty ruled for three generations, the last Banu Sumadih emir fled the Almoravids in 1091, eventually making his way to the Hammadid king Al-Mansur ibn Nasir, who gave him command of Dellys in Algeria.

==Rulers==
The Banu Sumadih dynasty rulers were:
*Ma&#x27;n ibn Muhammad ibn Sumadih (1041–1051), previously governor under Taifa of Valencia
*Al-Mu&#x27;tasim ibn Sumadih (1051–1091), a noted Arabic poet. He succeeded when underage, under the regency of his uncle Abu &#x27;Utba.
*Mu&#x27;izz ud-Dawla ibn Sumadih (1091), fled to the Hammadid dynasty; granted command of north African Dellys.

<doc id="643892" wikidata="Q3206850" url="?curid=643892" title="Holsworthy Barracks">
<text>Holsworthy military base is an Australian Army military barracks, located in the Heathcote National Park in Holsworthy approximately from the central business district, in south-western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The barracks is part of the Holsworthy military reserve, which is training area and artillery range for the Australian Army, established in the 1880s and been in active use since World War I. Following World War II, it became a major base for the permanent component of the Australian Army in New South Wales. Holsworthy Military Airport is also located in the reserve. Activities carried out on the base include the use of firing ranges, chemical weapons testing, fire training, vehicle maintenance, and bulk chemical storage and distribution from numerous above ground and underground storage tanks.

Following the movement of many units of the Regular Army to Darwin, Northern Territory, in the late 1990s, many Army Reserve units were moved from other depots to Holsworthy Barracks, including the Headquarters of the 5th Brigade.

The base is currently home to 142 Signal Squadron, 2nd Commando Regiment (2 Cdo Regt), Special Operations Engineer Regiment and 6th Aviation Regiment. A number of training units and the Defence Force Correctional Establishment are also located at Holsworthy.

The base is also home to the regional headquarters of both NSW Australian Army Cadets Brigade and NSW 2nd Australian Army Cadets Brigade.

==Terrorism plot==
On 4 August 2009, five men from Melbourne, Victoria, were charged over the Holsworthy Barracks terror plot, a plan to storm the barracks with automatic weapons, and shoot anyone they encountered until they themselves were killed or captured. The men were connected with the Somali-based terrorist group al-Shabaab. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd later announced that the federal government had ordered a review of security at all military bases. On 6 August 2009, a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reporter and photographer were charged with taking a photograph of a defence installation after being granted entry to the military base. In December 2011 three of the terror plotters were sentenced to 18 years in prison.

<doc id="643893" wikidata="Q68175" url="?curid=643893" title="Wilhelm Klinkerfues">
<text>Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm Klinkerfues (29 March 1827 in Hofgeismar – 28 January 1884 in Göttingen) was a German astronomer and meteorologist. He discovered six comets and published weather reports of varying accuracy based on his meteorological measurements. 

==Early life==

Klinkerfues was born in Hofgeismar, the son of army doctor Johann Reinhard Klinkerfues and his wife Sabine (née Dedolph). After the early death of his parents, he was brought up by relatives, and after attending high school qualified as a surveyor in Kassel. In this capacity he subsequently worked on the new Frankfurt - Kassel railway.

From 1847 to 1851 Klinkerfues studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Marburg. He then became an assistant to Carl Friedrich Gauss at Göttingen Observatory, where he completed his Ph.D. with a thesis on orbit calculations of double stars. After Gauss&#x27;s death in 1855, the mathematician W. E. Weber replaced him as director, but Klinkerfues was to be temporarily responsible for the observatory from 1861.

== Career ==
Klinkerfues discovered 6 comets, and in 1860 led an expedition to Spain to observe a solar eclipse. He was finally appointed &quot;director for practical astronomy&quot; at Göttingen in 1868. However, the role of Klinkerfues&#x27; section of the observatory was solely to deal with practical work, the theoretical work being placed in the hands of Ernst Schering. Klinkerfues was, like his predecessor, allowed to live in the eastern wing of the observatory, but the division of the observatory&#x27;s organisation between the two teams was to be a source of constant conflict.

In his 1871 book &quot;Theoretische Astronomie&quot; Klinkerfues described how the orbits of celestial bodies in the solar system could be calculated. In the same period he compiled a catalogue of around 6900 observed stars.

Klinkerfues also had an abiding interest in meteorology, developing a hygrometer, patented in 1877, that was later manufactured in Göttingen by Wilhelm Lambrecht. His weather forecasts, published in newspapers, proved to be often incorrect, which led to them cruelly parodying his last name as &quot;Flunkerkies&quot;. Undeterred by this criticism, he published a book on the hygrometer&#x27;s use in 1875, and developed a detonator for use in Göttingen&#x27;s gas street lighting. He also continued to supervise doctoral students, one of whom was Hermann Kobold.

Klinkerfues was plagued by debt for much of his life, exacerbated by ill-advised business ventures. He attempted to persevere with his astronomical work, in the course of which, as his obituary in the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; noted, he published many papers that were &quot;singularly readable, and often contained the most original and suggestive ideas. Occasionally, indeed, they were altogether of a quaintly humorous character, introducing, for instance, the alleged wonderful discoveries of an imaginary Professor Monkhouse&quot;. Nevertheless, he continued to encounter problems with professional advancement: 

&quot;It would be useless and almost impossible to attempt to describe how the warm-hearted and genial astronomer failed to take that position amongst his colleagues to which his undoubtedly great natural talents entitled him. His extreme carelessness in late years in his outward appearances was certainly much against him, but the unflagging zeal with which he delivered a whole course of lectures, if need were, even to a single student, ought to have told in his favour, as to some extent it doubtless did.&quot;

In 1881 he published &quot;Tobias Mayer&#x27;s grössere Mondkarte nebst Detailzeichnungen&quot;, a large Moon map and set of drawings by Tobias Mayer that had gathered dust in the observatory library for 130 years. 

== Death ==
The ongoing conflicts in the observatory, declining health, financial problems and further disappointments drove him to shoot himself on 28 January 1884. His university colleagues had to pay for his funeral.

== Honors ==
The asteroid 112328 Klinkerfues is named in his honour, as were 6 non-periodic comets:
* C/1853 L1 (a.k.a. 1853 III)
* C/1854 L1 (a.k.a. 1854 III)
* C/1854 R1 (a.k.a. 1854 IV)
* C/1857 M1 (a.k.a. 1857 III)
* C/1857 Q1 (a.k.a. 1857 V)
* C/1863 G1 (a.k.a. 1863 II)

<text>The Excalibur automobile is a car styled after the 1928 Mercedes-Benz SSK by Brooks Stevens for Studebaker. Stevens subsequently formed a company to manufacture and market the cars, which were a standard Studebaker car with special bodywork (and soon got an upgraded engine as well).

A prototype premiered at car shows in 1963, fitted on a Studebaker Lark Convertible chassis and using a Studebaker 289 V-8. Studebaker ceased engine production in December 1963 and consolidating all manufacturing to its Hamilton, Ontario, plant, ending the availability of that engine.

Stevens subsequently obtained engines from General Motors through his friends GM executives Ed Cole and Semon &quot;Bunkie&quot; Knudsen. These were Chevrolet 327s in Corvette tune, making the Excalibur a strong performer. With the standard 3.31:1 rear axle, acceleration from took less than six seconds. Projected top speed was .

Over 3,500 Excalibur cars were built, all in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The American comedian Phyllis Diller was a notable proponent of the Excalibur automobile, and owned four of them.

The company failed in 1986 but was revived several times. Production of the Excalibur continued until 1990.

<doc id="643905" wikidata="Q5015721" url="?curid=643905" title="Cabo Blanco Absolute Natural Reserve">
<text>The Cabo Blanco Absolute Natural Reserve is a Nature Reserve of Costa Rica, part of the Tempisque Conservation Area in the province of Puntarenas, covering an area of terrestrial and marine on the southern tip of the Nicoya Peninsula near Montezuma-Cabuya and Mal Pais.

The site is home to the San Miguel Biological Station which was developed to promote and support teaching, research, and environmental education and has facilities that include classrooms, laboratories and a reference library. The reserve was created in 1963 due to a campaign started by Nils Olof Wessberg and was the first major conservation project in the country.

== History ==

Up to the 1960s the lands that now constitute the Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve were being depleted of their natural forests for use as farm and pasture land. The emphasis in those days was to develop and increase agricultural production and cattle, and little concern was given to conservation of natural habitats.

Nils Olof Wessberg (known as Nicolás) and Karen Mogensen arrived in Costa Rica 1955 in the pursuit of Karen&#x27;s dream of finding happiness in harmony with nature. They chose to establish themselves in the Nicoya Peninsula.

Soon after establishing themselves in a farm near the Montezuma area, Nicolás set up on an expedition to the Cabo Blanco area in search for native tree seeds to reforest their newly acquired farm. Upon arriving to the area, he was amazed at the abundant wildlife and the size of the trees in the area. This was like an oasis in the midst of a desert as all lands around had been devastated to give way to low-yield pasture and agricultural lands.

This experience was what triggered their determination to save and preserve this &quot;natural jewel&quot;. With the aid of international conservation societies, they bought of land in 1963 and turned these lands into the first protected area in all of Costa Rica.

Nicolas was murdered in 1975 while he was campaigning to protect Osa Peninsula from depletion by hunting, forest and gold exploitation. Karen died in 1994. Their bodies are buried at the Nicolas Wessberg Natural Reserve which was the original farm they bought when first arrived in the Montezuma area.

== Flora ==

About 140 different species of trees have been identified inside the park. Because the park is located in a transition area between the dry and wet forest, a unique combination of evergreen trees (never lose their leaves) which are characteristic of the humid rainforest, and trees of the deciduous type (which lose their foliage during the dry season) and are characteristic of the dry forest.

Among the dry forest specimens found we can mention the &quot;Pochote&quot; (Bombacopsis quinata), the &quot;Guacimo&quot; (Guazuma ulmifolia), and the &quot;Indio Desnudo&quot; (Bursera simaruba) but there are many other trees present that are native to the whole Nicoya Peninsula area.

Among the evergreens is worth mentioning the tall and impressive &quot;Espavel&quot; (Anacardium excelsum), the &quot;Guacimo Colorado&quot; (Luehea seemanii), and the beautiful &quot;Cortez Amarillo&quot; (Tabebuia ochracea) which bursts into a yellow spectacle of flowers during the dry months of March and April.

== Fauna ==

There is a considerable variety of mammals in the park. Predominant among these and very easily spotted by visitors are the howler (&quot;Alouatta palliata&quot;) and the white-face (&quot;Cebus capuchinus&quot;) monkeys.

Also very abundant and easily seen are the white-nosed coati (&quot;Nasua narica&quot;) and the white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;).
Also present, but harder to spot are the margay (&quot;Felis wiedii&quot;) and the coyote (&quot;Cannis latrans&quot;).

But the greatest wealth in fauna is in the abundant marine birds, marine mammals including orcas, fish, crabs and mollusks found in the shore waters and in the Cabo Blanco island. 
Worth mentioning is the healthy population of brown boobies and pelicans found in the island, and also the plentiful conch (&quot;Strombus galeatus&quot;) found on the park&#x27;s waters.

<doc id="643914" wikidata="Q1718987" url="?curid=643914" title="Oban, New Zealand">
<text>Oban is the principal settlement on Stewart Island, the southernmost inhabited island of the New Zealand archipelago. Oban is centred on Halfmoon Bay (sometimes used as an alternative name for the town), and stretches over a peninsula to Paterson Inlet. It has aircraft connections with Invercargill and a ferry service to Bluff, both on the mainland South Island.

The settlement was named after Oban in Scotland (&quot;An t-Òban&quot; in Scottish Gaelic, meaning &quot;The Little Bay&quot;), due to the strong influence Scottish settlers had in the south of early colonial New Zealand.

The island has received a moderate boost of commerce and some millions in government funding since tourism increased markedly after the opening of the Rakiura National Park. 

It is possible to see kākā during the day and kiwi during the night in Oban. Efforts have been made to eradicate many of the introduced predators of native birds in Oban, such as stoats and domestic cats, with bigger plans to target possums, three species of rat, and hedgehogs.

==Demographics==
Oban is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers , and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the wider Stewart Island statistical area.
Oban had a population of 300 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 27 people (9.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 9 people (3.1%) since the 2006 census. There were 165 households, comprising 156 males and 144 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.08 males per female, with 33 people (11.0%) aged under 15 years, 51 (17.0%) aged 15 to 29, 144 (48.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 69 (23.0%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 92.0% European/Pākehā, 19.0% Māori, 1.0% Pasifika, 1.0% Asian, and 1.0% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 65.0% had no religion, 26.0% were Christian, 1.0% were Buddhist and 3.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 66 (24.7%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 45 (16.9%) people had no formal qualifications. 39 people (14.6%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 150 (56.2%) people were employed full-time, 42 (15.7%) were part-time, and 3 (1.1%) were unemployed.

==Climate==

The Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as a mid-latitude oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Temperatures are mild to cool year-round, with average high temperatures ranging from in January, the warmest month, to in July, the coolest month. The strong oceanic influence here results in small temperature variations. The diurnal temperature variation is quite low, around yearlong, and seasonal temperature variation (the difference between the warmest and coldest months) is about . Precipitation averages per year, and is evenly distributed across the year (see climate chart). Year-round, Oban lies in the direct path of mid-latitude cyclones (low-pressure systems, or depressions) arriving from the Southern Ocean, generally moving from southwest to northeast, or west to east. As such, the climate is predominantly windy, cloudy and rainy; clear days and days with calm to minimal wind are rare.

==Rakiura Museum==

The Rakiura Museum was first opened in 1960 in a converted house. It was reopened in December 2020 in a purpose-built $3 million building in December 2020. it contains artifacts and displays including the history of whaling and sealing around Stewart Island, boat building, Maori settlement and natural history of Stewart Island.

==Education==

Halfmoon Bay School / Te Kura o Rakiura caters for years 1 to 8 with a roll of students as of The school was established in 1874.

==Churches==
Oban Presbyterian Church was built in 1904. Electric lighting was installed in 1957. it is located on Kamahi Road and overlooks Halfmoon Bay. It has no resident minister, but has visiting preachers.

St Andrews Anglican Church is situated at 10 Excelsior Road. Prince Harry visited St Andrews in 2015.

<doc id="643915" wikidata="Q619781" url="?curid=643915" title="Imja Tse">
<text>Imja Tse, better known as Island Peak, is a mountain in Sagarmatha National Park in the Himalayas of eastern Nepal. The peak was named Island Peak in 1953 by members of the British Mount Everest expedition because it appears as an island in a sea of ice when viewed from Dingboche. The peak was later renamed in 1983 to Imja Tse but Island Peak remains the popular choice. The peak is actually an extension of the ridge coming down off the south end of Lhotse Shar.

The southwest summit of Imja Tse was first climbed in 1953 as part of a training exercise by a British expedition that went on to summit Mount Everest. The team that climbed Imja Tse comprised Tenzing Norgay, Charles Evans, Alfred Gregory, Charles Wylie and seven other Sherpas. The main summit was first climbed in 1956 by Hans-Rudolf Von Gunten and two unknown Sherpas, members of a Swiss team that went on to make the second ascent of Everest and the first ascent of Lhotse.

== Climbing route ==

To climb Island Peak, one has the option of starting from a base camp at called Pareshaya Gyab and starting the climb between 2 and 3 A.M. Another popular option is to ascend to High Camp at around to reduce the amount of effort and time needed for summit day. However, an adequate water supply and concerns about sleeping at a higher altitude may dictate starting from base camp. Base camp to high camp is basically a hike but just above high camp, some rocky steps require moderate scrambling up through a broad open gully. At the top of the gully, glacier travel begins and proceeds up a steep snow and ice slope. From here, fixed ropes may be set up by the guides for the strenuous ascent of nearly to the summit ridge. The climb to the summit is somewhat difficult due to steep climbing. On top, while Mount Everest is a mere ten kilometres away to the north, the view is blocked by the massive wall of Lhotse, towering above the summit.

=== Headwall crevasse ===
A substantial crevasse along most of the headwall leading to the summit ridge has sometimes caused teams to turn back. In April 2009, the Nepal Mountaineering Association tasked the Nepal Mountaineering Instructors&#x27; Association with installing stairs (ladders) at the crevasse. As of the 2016 fall climbing season, a 5-metre high fixed aluminum ladder is being used to cross the crevasse.

<text>ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 &quot;Systems and software engineering – Software life cycle processes&quot; is an international standard for software lifecycle processes. First introduced in 1995, it aims to be a primary standard that defines all the processes required for developing and maintaining software systems, including the outcomes and/or activities of each process.

== Revision history ==
ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 is the newest version, published in November 2017. The IEEE Computer Society joined directly with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7/WG 7 in the editing process for this version. A significant change is that it adopts a process model identical to the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 process model (there is one name change, the 15288 &quot;System Requirements Definition&quot; process is renamed to the &quot;System/Software Requirements Definition&quot; process). This harmonization of the two standards led to the removal of separate software development and software reuse processes, bringing the total number of 43 processes from 12207 down to the 30 processes defined in 15288. It also caused changes to the quality management and quality assurance process activities and outcomes. Additionally, the definition of &quot;audit&quot; and related audit activities were updated. Annex I of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 provides a process mapping between the 2017 version and the previous version, including the primary process alignments between the two versions; this is intended to enable traceability and ease transition for users of the previous version.

Prior versions include:
* ISO/IEC 12207:2008, which was published in February 2008
* ISO/IEC 12207:1995/Amd 2:2004, an amended version of the prior, published in November 2004
* ISO/IEC 12207:1995/Amd 1:2002, an amended version of the prior, published in May 2002
* ISO/IEC 12207:1995, the first iteration, published in July 1995; originally was divided into five primary processes (acquisition, supply, development, operation, and maintenance), with eight supporting and four organizational life cycle processes

===IEEE versions===
Prior to the IEEE Computer Society formally joining the editing process (becoming a major stakeholder) for the 2017 release, the IEEE maintained its own versions of ISO/IEC 12207, initially with modifications made jointly with the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA). With the 2008 update came a &quot;shared strategy of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 and the IEEE to harmonize their respective collections of standards,&quot; resulting in identical standards thereon, but with slightly different names. Those IEEE versions included:

* IEEE Std. 12207-2008: &quot;integrates ISO/IEC 12207:1995 with its two amendments and was coordinated with the parallel revision of ISO/IEC 15288:2002 (System life cycle processes) to align structure, terms, and corresponding organizational and project processes&quot;; superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017
* IEEE/EIA 12207.2-1997: &quot;provides implementation consideration guidance for the normative clauses of IEEE/EIA 12207.0&quot;; superseded/made obsolete by IEEE Std. 12207-2008, which was then superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017
* IEEE/EIA 12207.1-1997: &quot;provides guidance for recording life cycle data resulting from the life cycle processes of IEEE/EIA 12207.0&quot;; superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2011, which was then superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2017
* IEEE/EIA 12207.0-1996: &quot;consists of the clarifications, additions, and changes [to ISO/IEC 12207:1995 for industry implementation] accepted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) as formulated by a joint project of the two organizations&quot;; superseded by IEEE Std. 12207-2008, which was then superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017

It&#x27;s also worth noting that IEEE/EIA 12207 officially replaced MIL-STD-498 (released in December 1994) for the development of DoD software systems on May 27, 1998.

== Processes not stages ==
The standard establishes a set of processes for managing the lifecycle of software. The standard &quot;does not prescribe a specific software life cycle model, development methodology, method, modelling approach, or technique.&quot;. Instead, the standard (as well as ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288) distinguishes between a &quot;stage&quot; and &quot;process&quot; as follows:

* stage: &quot;period within the life cycle of an entity that relates to the state of its description or realization&quot;. A stage is typically a period of time and ends with a &quot;primary decision gate&quot;.
* process: &quot;set of interrelated or interacting activities that transforms inputs into outputs&quot;. The same process often recurs within different stages.

Stages (aka phases) are not the same as processes, and this standard only defines specific processes - it does not define any particular stages. Instead, the standard acknowledges that software life cycles vary, and may be divided into stages (also called phases) that represent major life cycle periods and give rise to primary decision gates. No particular set of stages is normative, but it does mention two examples:

* The system life cycle stages from ISO/IEC TS 24748-1 could be used (concept, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement).
* It also notes that a common set of stages for software is concept exploration, development, sustainment, and retirement.

The life cycle processes the standard defines are not aligned to any specific stage in a software life cycle. Indeed, the life cycle processes that involve planning, performance, and evaluation &quot;should be considered for use at every stage&quot;. In practice, processes occur whenever they are needed within any stage.

== Processes ==
ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 divides software life cycle processes into four main process groups: agreement, organizational project-enabling, technical management, and technical processes. Under each of those four process groups are a variety of sub-categories, including the primary activities of acquisition and supply (agreement); configuration (technical management); and operation, maintenance, and disposal (technical).

===Agreement processes===
Here ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 includes the acquisition and supply processes, which are activities related to establishing an agreement between a supplier and acquirer. Acquisition covers all the activities involved in initiating a project. The acquisition phase can be divided into different activities and deliverables that are completed chronologically. During the supply phase a project management plan is developed. This plan contains information about the project such as different milestones that need to be reached.

===Organizational project-enabling processes===
Detailed here are life cycle model management, infrastructure management, portfolio management, human resource management, quality management, and knowledge management processes. These processes help a business or organization enable, control, and support the system life cycle and related projects. Life cycle model management helps ensure acquisition and supply efforts are supported, while infrastructure and portfolio management supports business and project-specific initiatives during the entire system life cycle. The rest ensure the necessary resources and quality controls are in place to support the business&#x27; project and system endeavors. If an organization does not have an appropriate set of organizational processes, a project executed by the organization may apply those processes directly to the project instead.

===Technical management processes===
ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 places eight different processes here:

* [Project planning]
* Project assessment and control
* Decision management
* Risk management
* Configuration management
* Information management
* Measurement
* Quality assurance

These processes deal with planning, assessment, and control of software and other projects during the life cycle, ensuring quality along the way.

===Technical processes===
The technical processes of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 encompass 14 different processes, some of which came from the old software-specific processes that were phased out from the 2008 version.

The full list includes:

* Business or mission analysis
* Stakeholder needs and requirements definition
* Systems/Software requirements definition
* Architecture definition
* Design definition
* System analysis
* Implementation
* Integration
* Verification
* Transition
* Validation
* Operation
* Maintenance
* Disposal

These processes involve technical activities and personnel (information technology, troubleshooters, software specialists, etc.) during pre-, post- and during operation. The analysis and definition processes early on set the stage for how software and projects are implemented. Additional processes of integration, verification, transition, and validation help ensure quality and readiness. The operation and maintenance phases occur simultaneously, with the operation phase consisting of activities like assisting users in working with the implemented software product, and the maintenance phase consisting of maintenance tasks to keep the product up and running. The disposal process describes how the system/project will be retired and cleaned up, if necessary.

== Conformance ==

Clause 4 describes the document&#x27;s intended use and conformance requirements. It is expected that particular projects &quot;may not need to use all of the processes provided by this document.&quot; In practice, conforming to this standard normally involves selecting and declaring the set of suitable processes. This can be done through either &quot;full conformance&quot; or &quot;tailored conformance&quot;.

&quot;Full conformance&quot; can be claimed in one of two ways. &quot;Full conformance to tasks&quot; can be claimed if all requirements of the declared processes&#x27; activities and tasks are met. &quot;Full conformance to outcomes&quot; can be claimed if all required outcomes of the declared processes are met. The latter permits more variation.

&quot;Tailored conformance&quot; may be declared when specific clauses are selected or modified through the tailoring process also defined in the document.

<doc id="643931" wikidata="Q380575" url="?curid=643931" title="Kikunae Ikeda">
<text>was a Japanese chemist and Tokyo Imperial University professor of chemistry who, in 1908, uncovered the chemical basis of a taste he named umami. It is one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, sour and salty.

== Education ==
Ikeda graduated in 1889 from Tokyo Imperial University in chemistry. In 1891, he became a professor at the Higher Normal School of Tokyo, in 1896 he became an associate professor at Tokyo Imperial University. From 1899, Prof. Ikeda studied in Germany for two years at the laboratory of Prof. Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald at the University of Leipzig, which was then the center of physical chemistry. After a brief stay in London, he returned to Tokyo in 1901 and became a full professor in chemistry at Tokyo Imperial University.

== Discoveries ==

In 1907 at the Tokyo Imperial University in Japan, Ikeda was eating dinner with his family when he suddenly stopped. That day the dashi broth in his soup was more delicious than normal; after stirring a few times he realized the difference was the umami flavor from the addition of kombu, a species of brown macroalgae, and flakes of fish known as katsuobushi. He understood that kombu was the secret to that flavor, and from that day on he studied the chemical composition of kelp. Some noted that the taste of the umami is similar to the flavor of the haute cuisine that the French chef Auguste Escoffier created.

By 1908, he had isolated brown crystals of glutamic acid (glutamate) which conveyed the characteristic flavor. The chemical monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the chemical basis for the umami flavor. He chose to call it . By 1909 he had developed a process for mass-producing MSG. He was able to extract MSG from wheat and defatted soybean, and patented the process for its manufacture. Today, MSG is mass-produced from fermented cornstarch, sugar cane, molasses, or beet. His Ajinomoto Co., Inc. currently employs over 32,000 people. With this method the global production of MSG increased rapidly. MSG ranks today as one of the top flavor enhancers after salt and pepper.

Kikunae Ikeda also studied other foods to see if they contained umami, and confirmed that glutamate was responsible for part of the flavor of meat, seaweed and tomatoes. He believed that humans likely developed a taste for glutamate because it signaled the presence of proteins.

== Praise ==
On 18 April 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

<text>John Richard Kasich Jr. ( ; born May 13, 1952) is an American politician and author who was the 69th governor of Ohio from 2011 to 2019, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001, and a Republican candidate for the presidential nomination in 2000 and 2016.

Kasich was born and grew up in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, and moved to Ohio in 1970 to attend college. After a single term in the Ohio Senate, he served nine terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from . His tenure in the House included 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee and six years as chair of the House Budget Committee. Kasich was a key figure in the passage of both 1996 welfare reform legislation and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Kasich decided not to run for re-election in 2000 and ran for president instead. He withdrew from the race before the Republican primaries.

After leaving Congress, Kasich hosted &quot;Heartland with John Kasich&quot; on Fox News from 2001 to 2007 and served as managing director of the Lehman Brothers office in Columbus, Ohio. He ran for governor of Ohio in 2010, defeating Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. He was re-elected in 2014, defeating Democratic challenger Ed FitzGerald by 30 percentage points. Kasich was term-limited and could not seek a third gubernatorial term in 2018; he was succeeded by fellow Republican Mike DeWine.

Kasich ran for president again in 2016, finishing in fourth place in the Republican primaries behind Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. He won the primary in his home state of Ohio and finished second in New Hampshire. Kasich declined to support Trump as the Republican presidential nominee and did not attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which was held in Ohio. From 2019 to 2023, Kasich was a CNN contributor. Since March 2023, he has been an analyst on NBC News. Kasich is known as one of Trump&#x27;s most prominent critics within the Republican Party, and endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for president in a speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

==Early life, education, and early political career==

John Richard Kasich Jr. was born and raised in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. His parents were Anne ( Vukovich; 1918–1987) and John Richard Kasich (1919–1987), who worked as a mail carrier.

Kasich&#x27;s father was of Czech descent, while his mother was of Croatian descent. Both parents were children of immigrants and were practicing Roman Catholics. He has described himself as &quot;a Croatian and a Czech&quot;.

After attending public schools in his hometown of McKees Rocks, Kasich later left his native Pennsylvania, settling in Columbus, Ohio, in 1970 to attend Ohio State University, where he joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.

As a freshman, he wrote a letter to President Richard Nixon describing concerns he had about the nation and requesting a meeting with the President. The letter was delivered to Nixon by the university&#x27;s president Novice Fawcett and Kasich was granted a 20-minute meeting with Nixon in December 1970.

Earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Ohio State in 1974, he went on to work as a researcher for the Ohio Legislative Service Commission. From 1975 to 1978, he served as an administrative assistant to then-state Senator Buz Lukens.

==Ohio Senate career==

In 1978, Kasich ran against Democratic incumbent Robert O&#x27;Shaughnessy for State Senate. A political ally of Kasich remembers him during that time as a persistent campaigner: &quot;People said, &#x27;If you just quit calling me, I&#x27;ll support you.&#x27;&quot; At age 26, Kasich won with 56% of the vote, beginning his four-year term representing the 15th district. Kasich was the second youngest person ever elected to the Ohio Senate.

One of his first acts as a State Senator was to refuse a pay raise. Republicans gained control of the State Senate in 1980, but Kasich went his own way, for example, by opposing a budget proposal he believed would raise taxes and writing his own proposal instead.

== U.S. House of Representatives (1983–2001) ==
In 1982, Kasich ran for Congress in Ohio&#x27;s 12th congressional district, which included portions of Columbus as well as the cities of Westerville, Reynoldsburg, Worthington, and Dublin. He won the Republican primary with 83% of the vote and defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Bob Shamansky in the general election by a margin of 50%–47%. He would never face another contest nearly that close, and was re-elected eight more times with at least 64 percent of the vote.

During his congressional career, Kasich was considered a fiscal conservative, taking aim at programs supported by Republicans and Democrats. He worked with Ralph Nader in seeking to reduce corporate tax loopholes.

Kasich was a member of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years. He developed a &quot;fairly hawkish&quot; reputation on that committee, although he &quot;also zealously challenged&quot; defense spending he considered wasteful. Among the Pentagon projects that he targeted were the B-2 bomber program (teaming up with Democratic representative Ron Dellums to cut the program, their efforts were partly successful) and the A-12 bomber program (ultimately canceled by defense secretary Dick Cheney in 1991). He participated extensively in the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986, which reorganized the U.S. Department of Defense. He also pushed through the bill creating the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which closed obsolete U.S. military bases, and successfully opposed a proposed $110 million expansion of the Pentagon building after the end of the Cold War. He also &quot;proposed a national commission on arms control&quot; and &quot;urged tighter controls over substances that could be used for biological warfare.&quot;

Kasich said he was &quot;100 percent for&quot; the first Persian Gulf War as well as the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, but said that he did not favor U.S. military participation in the Lebanese Civil War or in Bosnia. In 1997, with fellow Republican representative Floyd Spence, he introduced legislation (supported by some congressional Democrats) for the U.S. to pull out of a multilateral peacekeeping force in Bosnia. In the House, he supported the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, a U.S. Representative Ron Dellums (D- CA)-led initiative to impose economic sanctions against apartheid-era South Africa.

===Ranking member of the House Budget Committee===

In 1993, Kasich became the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee. Kasich and other House Budget Committee Republicans proposed an alternative to President Bill Clinton&#x27;s deficit reduction bill, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. That proposal included funds to implement Republican proposals for health care, welfare, and crime control legislation and for a child tax credit. The Penny-Kasich Plan, named after Kasich and fellow lead sponsor Tim Penny, was supported by Republicans and conservative Democrats. It proposed $90 billion in spending cuts over five years, almost three times as much in cuts as the $37 billion in cuts backed by the Clinton administration and Democratic congressional leaders. About one-third ($27 billion) of the proposed Penny-Kasich cuts would come from means-testing Medicare, specifically by reducing Medicare payments to seniors who earned $75,000 or more in adjusted gross income. This angered the AARP, which lobbied against the legislation. Another $26 billion of the Penny-Kasich plan&#x27;s cuts would have come from the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign aid, which led Secretary of Defense Les Aspin to say that the plan would destroy military morale. Another $27 billion in savings would have come from federal layoffs. The proposal was narrowly defeated in the House by a 219–213 vote.

As ranking member of the Budget Committee, Kasich proposed his own health care reform plan as a rival to the Clinton health care plan of 1993 championed by First Lady Hillary Clinton, but more market-based. As journalist Zeke Miller wrote in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;The Kasich plan would have covered all Americans by 2005, using a form of an individual mandate that would have required employees to purchase insurance through their employers. (The mandate was an idea initially supported by conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation.)&quot;

On November 17, 1993, Kasich voted to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement, casting a &quot;yea&quot; vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.

In 1994, Kasich was one of the Republican leaders to support a last-minute deal with President Bill Clinton to pass the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. After a series of meetings with Clinton&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, a longtime friend of Kasich, the assault weapons ban was passed when 42 Republicans crossed party lines and voted to ban assault weapons with the Democrats. His support of the assault-weapons ban resulted in the NRA Political Victory Fund giving Kasich an &quot;F&quot; rating in 1994.

===Chair of the House Budget Committee===
In 1995, when Republicans gained the majority in the United States Congress following the 1994 election, Kasich became chair of the House Budget Committee. In 1996, he introduced the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act in the House, an important welfare reform bill signed into law by President Clinton.

During the 1996 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Bob Dole was reported to have considered Kasich as a vice presidential running mate but instead selected Jack Kemp, a former congressman and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

In 1997, Kasich rose to national prominence after becoming &quot;the chief architect of a deal that balanced the federal budget for the first time since 1969&quot;—the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

In 1998, Kasich voted to impeach President Clinton on all four charges made against him. In 1999, while the Senate prepared to vote on the charges, he said: &quot;I believe these are impeachable and removable offenses.&quot;

== 2000 presidential campaign ==
Kasich did not seek re-election in 2000. In February 1999, he formed an exploratory committee to run for president. In March 1999 he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination. After very poor fundraising, he dropped out in July 1999, before the Iowa Straw Poll, and endorsed governor George W. Bush of Texas.

== Private sector career (2001–2009) ==
After leaving Congress, Kasich went to work for Fox News, hosting &quot;Heartland with John Kasich&quot; on the Fox News Channel and guest-hosting &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, filling in for Bill O&#x27;Reilly as needed. He also occasionally appeared as a guest on &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;.

=== Business career ===
Kasich served on the board of directors for several corporations, including Invacare Corp. and the Chicago-based Norvax Inc. In 2001, Kasich joined Lehman Brothers&#x27; investment banking division as a managing director, in Columbus, Ohio. He remained at Lehman Brothers until it declared bankruptcy in 2008. That year, Lehman Brothers paid him a $182,692 salary and a $432,200 bonus. He stated that the bonus was for work performed in 2007.

Kasich&#x27;s employment by Lehman Brothers was criticized during his subsequent campaigns in light of the firm&#x27;s collapse during the financial crisis. Kasich responded to critics by saying: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t involved in the inner workings of Lehman, I was a banker. I didn&#x27;t go to board meetings or go and talk investment strategy with the top people. I was nowhere near that. That&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s sort of like being a car dealer in Zanesville and being blamed for the collapse of GM.&quot;

=== Political activities from 2001 to 2009===
Republicans made efforts to recruit Kasich to run for Ohio governor in 2006, but he declined to enter the race.

In 2008, Kasich formed Recharge Ohio, a political action committee (PAC) with the goal of raising money to help Republican candidates for the Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate, in an effort to retain Republican majorities in the Ohio General Assembly. Kasich served as honorary chairman of the PAC.

== Governor of Ohio ==

=== 2010 election ===

On May 1, 2009, Kasich filed papers to run for governor of Ohio against incumbent Democratic governor Ted Strickland. He formally announced his candidacy on June 1, 2009. On January 15, 2010, Kasich announced Ohio State Auditor Mary Taylor as his running mate.

During a speech before Ashtabula County Republicans in March 2009, Kasich talked about the need to &quot;break the back of organized labor in the schools,&quot; according to the Ashtabula &quot;Star Beacon&quot;.

Ohio teachers&#x27; unions supported Strickland, and after Kasich&#x27;s gubernatorial victory, he said, &quot;I am waiting for the teachers&#x27; unions to take out full-page ads in all the major newspapers, apologizing for what they had to say about me during this campaign.&quot;

Elsewhere, he said he was willing to work with &quot;unions that make things.&quot;

On May 4, 2010, Kasich won the Republican nomination for governor, having run unopposed. On November 2, 2010, Kasich defeated Strickland in a closely contested race to win the governorship. He was sworn in at midnight on January 10, 2011, in a private ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. It was then followed by a ceremonial inauguration at the Ohio Theatre at noon on the same day.

=== 2014 re-election ===

In November 2014, Kasich won re-election, defeating Democrat Ed FitzGerald, the county executive of Cuyahoga County, 64% to 33%. He won 86 of 88 counties.

Kasich, who was elected with Tea Party support in 2010, faced some backlash from some Tea Party activists. His decision to accept the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&#x27;s expansion of Medicaid caused some Tea Party activists to refuse to support his campaign. Kasich supported longtime ally and campaign veteran Matt Borges over Portage County Tea Party chairman Tom Zawistowski for the position of chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. Zawistowski secured just three votes in his run for the chairmanship. Tea Party groups announced they would support a primary challenger, or, if none emerged, the Libertarian nominee.

Ultimately, Zawistowski failed to field anyone on the ballot and the Libertarian nominee (former Republican State Representative Charlie Earl) was removed from the ballot after failing to gain the required number of valid signatures necessary for ballot access.

==Political positions and record==
Kasich is considered by some to be a moderate Republican due to his strong condemnation of conservatives and his opposition to Donald Trump. However, his record in the House and as governor of Ohio has led others to point out that his views place him to the right of most moderate politicians. Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, who has known Kasich for years, says that &quot;If you had asked me in the 90s about Kasich I would have said he was a Gingrich conservative.&quot; Kasich&#x27;s friend Curt Steiner, former chief of staff to former Republican Ohio governor and U.S. senator George Voinovich, described Kasich as a &quot;solid Republican&quot; with &quot;an independent streak.&quot;

Kasich&#x27;s tenure as governor was notable for his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, his work combating the opioid addiction crisis, his attempt (later reversed by Ohio voters in a 2011 referendum) to curtail collective bargaining for public sector employees, his local government funding cuts, his passage of several anti-abortion laws, his veto of a six-week abortion ban, his tax cuts, and his evolving position on gun control.

===Abortion===
Kasich opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest, and danger to the mother&#x27;s life. As governor, he signed 18 abortion-restrictive measures into law. In June 2013, Kasich signed into law a state budget, HB 59, which stripped some $1.4 million in federal dollars from Planned Parenthood by placing the organization last on the priority list for family-planning funds; provided funding to crisis pregnancy centers; and required women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasounds. The budget also barred abortion providers from entering into emergency transfer agreements with public hospitals, requiring abortion providers to find private hospitals willing to enter into transfer agreements. Another provision of the bill requires abortion providers to offer information on family planning and adoption services in certain situations. Under the budget, rape crisis centers could lose public funding if they counseled sexual assault victims about abortion.

In 2015, Kasich said in an interview that Planned Parenthood &quot;ought to be de-funded&quot;, but added that Republicans in Congress should not force a government shutdown over the issue.

In December 2016, Kasich approved a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, except when a pregnancy endangers a woman&#x27;s life, but vetoed HB 493, a six-week abortion ban. Kasich cited the cost to taxpayers of defending the legislation in court, and the likelihood that the six-week bill would be struck down in federal court as reasons for vetoing the more restrictive bill. In December 2018, Kasich again vetoed a proposed six-week abortion ban, citing the cost to taxpayers and previous rulings by the federal courts. He did sign a bill into law that bans the dilation and evacuation procedure commonly used for abortion.

===Climate change, energy, and environment===
In a speech in April 2012, Kasich acknowledged that climate change is real and is a problem. In the same speech, however, Kasich said that the Environmental Protection Agency should not regulate carbon emissions and that instead states and private companies should be in charge of regulating coal-fired power plant emissions. In 2015, Kasich stated that he did not know all the causes of climate change, and that he did not know the extent to which humans contribute to climate change.

In 2014, Kasich signed into law a bill freezing Ohio&#x27;s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) program for two years. Ohio&#x27;s RPS program was created by 2008 legislation and required the state to acquire 12.5 percent of its energy portfolio from renewable sources and to reduce energy consumption by 22 percent by 2025. The legislation signed by Kasich to stop the program was supported by Republican legislative leaders, utility companies, and some industry groups, and opposed by environmentalists, some manufacturers, and the American Lung Association. In 2016, Kasich broke with fellow Republicans in the state legislature by vetoing their attempt to continue blocking the RPS standards; as a result, the freeze ended on December 31, 2016, and the clean-energy mandate resumed. This veto won Kasich praise from environmentalist groups, and angered Republicans in the state legislature.

In his 2015 budget plan, Kasich proposed raising the tax rate on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities. Specifically, Kasich&#x27;s plan called for imposing a 6.5 percent severance tax on crude oil and natural gas extracted via horizontal drilling and sold at the source (about $3.25 per $50 barrel of oil), and for an additional 4.5 percent tax per thousand cubic feet on natural gas and liquefied natural gas (about $0.16 per thousand cubic feet). The proposal would not affect conventional drilling taxes.

Kasich formerly supported fracking in Ohio state parks and forests, signing legislation in mid-2011 authorizing him to appoint a five-member commission to oversee the leasing of mineral rights on state land to the highest bidders. In 2012, Kasich aides planned a campaign with a stated goal to &quot;marginalize the effectiveness of communications by adversaries about the initiative&quot; to bring fracking to state parks and forests, naming in an email the Ohio Sierra Club and state Representatives Robert F. Hagan and Nickie Antonio as adversaries of the plan. Kasich never appointed the commission, and the promotional plan was never put into effect. A memo and email relating to the 2012 promotional campaign were publicly released for the first time in February 2015, which according to the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; attracted criticism from state environmental and liberal groups, as well as Democratic state legislators, who called for an investigation. On the same day the governor reversed himself, with a spokesman saying, &quot;At this point, the governor doesn&#x27;t support fracking in state parks. We reserve the right to revisit that, but it&#x27;s not what he wants to do right now, and that&#x27;s been his position for the past year and a half.&quot;

In April 2015, Kasich signed a bill aimed at protecting Lake Erie&#x27;s water quality. The bill places restrictions on the spread of manure and other fertilizers that contribute to toxic algal blooms and requires large public water treatment plants to monitor phosphorus levels. The bill had been unanimously approved by both chambers of the Ohio Legislature the previous month.

Kasich supported the Keystone XL oil pipeline project and, along with other Republican governors, signed an open letter in February 2015 urging federal approval for the project. In 2016, in response to a request from South Dakota under the terms of an interstate compact, Kasich dispatched 37 Ohio state troopers to South Dakota, where they were stationed around Dakota Access Pipeline protests near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. This controversial deployment prompted unsuccessful petitions to Kasich (from members of the public, Cincinnati City Council members, environmentalists, and some state legislators), who asked Kasich to recall the troopers.

===Policing and criminal justice===

====Prison privatization====
To offset a state budget deficit, Kasich proposed selling five state prisons to the for-profit prison industry. The Lake Erie prison was sold for $72.7 million to the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), generating savings of $3 million. Kasich&#x27;s Director of Corrections, Gary Mohr, whom he had hired in January 2011, had previously worked for CCA, but he said that he removed himself from the sales process. In an audit in October 2012, CCA was cited for 47 contractual violations, and failed a second audit later that year. In July 2015, the Kasich administration announced its intent to sell the North Central Correctional Institution at Marion, in order to recoup the state&#x27;s original investment in the facility and invest the proceeds in community-based alternatives to prison.

====Policing standards====
Following the separate fatal police shootings of John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Ohio, while each were holding BB guns, grand juries decided not to indict any of the officers involved. Following this, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board &quot;to address what he described as frustration and distrust among some Ohioans toward their police departments, particularly among the black community.&quot; The 23-member task force (with 18 members appointed by Kasich) was appointed in January 2015 and issued its 629-page final report and recommendations in April 2015. The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and involvement in policing, and new use-of-force and recruitment, hiring, and training standards for police agencies.

In April 2015, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board, a twelve-member board tasked (in conjunction with the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services and the Ohio Department of Public Safety) with developing statewide standards for the recruiting, hiring and screening of police officers, and for the use of force (including deadly force) by police. The advisory board, the first of its kind in Ohio, was also tasked by Kasich with developing &quot;model policies and best practice recommendations to promote better interaction and communication between law enforcement departments and their home communities.&quot; In August 2015, the board issued its recommendations, which placed &quot;an emphasis on the preservation of human life and restrict officers to defending themselves or others from death or serious injury.&quot;

In August 2015, Kasich said that he was open to the idea of requiring police officers to wear body cameras.

====Capital punishment====
As governor, Kasich presided over the executions of fifteen inmates and commuted the death sentences of seven inmates. The last execution in Ohio took place in July 2018. In January 2015, Kasich announced that, due to pending litigation and other issues, he was delaying all seven executions scheduled through January 2016. The delay was largely attributed to European pharmaceutical companies, which have refused to supply the state with deadly drugs necessary for executions. In February 2017, Kasich again delayed Ohio executions for an additional three months, after a federal judge ruled that Ohio&#x27;s three-drug lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional.

====Executive clemency====
Kasich used his power of executive clemency sparingly. He has the lowest clemency rate of any Ohio governor since at least the 1980s, when records began to be kept. In six years in office, Kasich granted 86 of the 2,291 requests that he acted upon. In 2016, Kasich granted executive clemency to 13 people; in all of the cases, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority had recommended clemency.

====Criminal justice reform issues====
Kasich supports various criminal justice reform efforts; according to conservative &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist George Will, Kasich &quot;favors fewer mandatory minimum sentences and has instituted prison policies that prepare inmates for re-integration into communities.&quot; In 2011, Kasich signed sentencing reform legislation which allowed judges to sentence defendants convicted of non-violent fourth- and fifth-degree felonies to &quot;community-based halfway house facilities&quot; instead of prison; expanded the earned credit system to allow inmates to reduce their sentences; and allowed felons who have already served 80 percent or more of their sentences to be immediately released.

In 2012, Kasich signed into law a bill, sponsored by Cleveland Democratic Senator Shirley Smith and Cincinnati Republican Senator Bill Seitz, easing the collateral consequences of criminal conviction.

In September 2014, Kasich touted the Ohio&#x27;s prison system&#x27;s recidivism rate, which is one of the lowest in the nation. U.S. Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, attributed a drop in Ohio&#x27;s recidivism rate &quot;to the bipartisan work of the state legislature, Governor Kasich, Ohio&#x27;s reentry leaders and the success of programs made possible at the federal level by the Second Chance Act,&quot; which Portman sponsored.

In 2015, Kasich proposed a state budget including $61.7 million for addiction treatment services for prisoners.

====Drug policy====
Kasich initially expressed opposition to medical marijuana in 2012, saying &quot;There&#x27;s better ways to help people who are in pain.&quot; However, in late 2015 and early 2016, Kasich said he was open to the legalization of medical marijuana.

In March 2014, in an effort to address the opioid epidemic, Kasich signed legislation (passed unanimously in both chambers of the state legislature) expanding the availability of naloxone, a lifesaving antidote to opioid overdoses. The measure allowed friends and family members of addicts to obtain access to naloxone and for first responders to carry naloxone. In July 2015, Kasich signed legislation further expanding the availability of naloxone, making it available without a prescription.

In a 2015 interview with radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, Kasich said he was opposed to the legalization of recreational marijuana and equated the drug to heroin, stating: &quot;In my state and across this country, if I happened to be president, I would lead a significant campaign down at the grassroots level to stomp these drugs out of our country.&quot;

When Kasich was asked by Hewitt whether, if elected president, he would federally enforce marijuana laws in states which have legalized marijuana, Kasich characterized it as a states&#x27; rights issue and said that &quot;I&#x27;d have to think about it.&quot; When asked the same question later in 2015, Kasich said: &quot;I would try to discourage the states from doing it ... but I would be tempted to say I don&#x27;t think we can go and start disrupting what they&#x27;ve decided.&quot;

Kasich opposed Issue 3, an Ohio ballot measure in 2015 that proposed the legalization of recreational marijuana, saying it was a &quot;terrible idea&quot;.

===Economic policy===

====State budgets and taxation====
During Kasich&#x27;s tenure, the state has eliminated a budget shortfall that his administration has estimated at $8 billion, but which the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; estimated at closer to $6 billion. (The &quot;New York Times&quot; put the number at $7.7 billion). Ohio also increased its &quot;rainy day fund&quot; from effectively zero to more than $2 billion.

Kasich &quot;closed the budget shortfall in part by cutting aid to local governments, forcing some of them to raise their own taxes or cut services. And increasing sales taxes helped make the income tax cuts possible.&quot; An analysis by the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; in March 2016 found that more than 70 cities and villages had lost at least $1 million a year due to Kasich&#x27;s budget and taxation policy.

In March 2008, Kasich called for &quot;phasing out&quot; Ohio&#x27;s state income tax.

During Kasich&#x27;s time as governor, Ohio ranked 22nd out of the 50 states for private-sector job growth, at 9.3%.

Kasich signed a state budget in 2011 which eliminated the state&#x27;s estate tax effective January 1, 2013.

In 2013, Kasich signed into law a $62 billion two-year state budget. The budget provided for a 10-percent state income tax cut phased in over three years, and an increase in the state sales tax from 5.5 percent to 5.75 percent. It also included a 50% tax cut for small business owners on the first $250,000 of annual net income. Kasich used his line-item veto power to reject a measure that would stop the Medicaid expansion (which Kasich had accepted from the federal government) to cover nearly 275,000 working poor Ohioans.

In 2015, Kasich signed into law a $71 billion two-year state budget after using his line-item veto power to veto 44 items. The overall 2015 budget provides a 6.3 percent state income-tax cut as a part one component of a $1.9 billion net tax reduction and lowers the top income-tax rate to slightly below 5 percent. The budget also &quot;spends $955 million more in basic state aid for K-12 schools than the last two-year period&quot;; &quot;boosts state funding for higher education to help offset a two-year tuition freeze at public universities&quot;; expands the Medicaid health program; increases cigarette taxes by 35 cents a pack; and &quot;prohibits independent health care and child care workers under contract with the state from unionizing.&quot;

====Senate Bill 5 and labor issues====
On March 31, 2011, in his first year as governor, Kasich signed into law Senate Bill 5, a controversial labor law which restricted collective bargaining rights of public employees, such as police officers, firefighters, and teachers. The legislation, championed by Kasich, prohibited all public employees from striking and restricted their ability to negotiate health care and pension benefits. The final version of the legislation signed by Kasich had passed the state Senate in a 17–16 vote (with six Senate Republicans joining all of the Senate Democrats in voting no) and the state House in a 53–44 vote, with two members abstaining.

Democrats and labor unions opposed the legislation and placed a referendum on the November 2011 ballot to repeal SB 5. SB 5 also &quot;sparked numerous protests with thousands of union workers and other opponents descending on the Statehouse, mirroring similar demonstrations in Wisconsin and injecting Ohio into the national debate over Republican governors&#x27; attempts to curb public workers&#x27; collective bargaining rights.&quot; Kasich and other supporters of SB 5 characterized the legislation as a necessary measure &quot;to help public employers control labor costs&quot; and reduce tax burdens to make Ohio more competitive with other states, while labor unions and other opponents characterized the bill as &quot;a union-busting attack on the middle class.&quot;

Ohio voters rejected Senate Bill 5 in a 61 percent to 39 percent vote, which was viewed as a rebuke to Kasich. On election night, Kasich said in a speech at the Ohio Statehouse that &quot;It&#x27;s clear the people have spoken. I heard their voices. I understand their decision. And frankly, I respect what the people have to say in an effort like this.&quot; Following this defeat, Kasich dropped efforts to pass broad-based collective bargaining restrictions, although in 2012 he supported a bill including &quot;provisions reminiscent of Senate Bill 5&quot; but applying only to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District.

In May 2015, Kasich rescinded executive orders issued by his predecessor Ted Strickland in 2007 and 2008 that provided the right to home health care contractors and in-home child care contractors to collectively bargain with the state.

====Balanced budget amendment====
Kasich has campaigned for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Kasich created a 501(c)(4) group, Balanced Budget Forever, to promote the cause.

===Free trade===
Kasich said in 2016 that &quot;I have never been an ideological supporter of free trade,&quot; but has long supported free trade agreements. He is a strong supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and participated with others in a meeting with President Obama in support of the agreement.

===Civil liberties and electronic surveillance===
In speaking in the 2016 campaign on domestic surveillance, Kasich has &quot;straddled the line,&quot; praising Rand Paul for saying that &quot;we need to get warrants,&quot; but also saying &quot;if there&#x27;s information they need, the government needs to get it.&quot; Kasich has said there needs to be &quot;a balance between good intelligence and the need to protect Americans from what can become an aggressive government somewhere down the road.&quot;

On one occasion, Kasich spoke out against proposals to mandate that technology companies provide a &quot;backdoor&quot; for the government to access encrypted devices, saying that this could end up aiding hackers. On a subsequent occasion, Kasich said that encryption was dangerous because it could stymie government antiterrorism investigations.

Kasich has condemned whistleblower Edward Snowden as a traitor.

===Education===
Kasich proposed new legislation which would increase funding to charter schools and poor school districts. He canceled the school-funding formula put into place by his Democratic predecessor, Governor Ted Strickland.

During Kasich&#x27;s tenure as governor, he pushed to expand charter schools, increase the number of school vouchers that use public money to pay for tuition at private schools, implement a &quot;merit pay&quot; scheme for teachers, and evaluate teachers by student standardized test scores in math and reading. Kasich supports the Common Core State Standards and has criticized Republicans who turned against it.

During Kasich&#x27;s tenure, funding for traditional public schools declined by about $500 million, while funding for charter schools has increased at least 27 percent. As calculated by the Howard Fleeter/Education Tax Policy Institute, total school funding under Kasich (including both charter and district schools) has ranged from a low of $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2013 to $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2015, which was higher than its previous peak under Kasich&#x27;s predecessor, Ted Strickland. As calculated by the Howard Fleeter/Education Tax Policy Institute, Kasich has proposed total school funding of $8.0 billion in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017. The Ohio Department of Education—which includes more spending areas than Fleeter&#x27;s does and so reports higher numbers—projects total school funding for Ohio schools to rise to slightly under $10.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017.

Analysts disagree &quot;on whether Kasich&#x27;s education budgets give increases beyond inflation.&quot; In the 2015 state budget, Kasich used his line-item veto power &quot;to cut more than $84 million of funding from public schools.&quot;

According to a September 2014 story in the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;, Kasich favored allowing public school districts &quot;to teach alternatives to evolution—such as intelligent design—if local school officials want to, under the philosophy of &#x27;local control.&#x27;&quot;

In 2011, Kasich had the idea of establishing a Holocaust memorial on the grounds of the Ohio Statehouse. Kasich successfully secured approval of the proposal from the Capital Square Review and Advisory Board. The $2 million Ohio Holocaust and Liberators Memorial, designed by Daniel Libeskind, is located across from the Ohio Theatre; the memorial was dedicated in 2014.

===Foreign and defense policy===
In November 2002, Kasich urged the invasion of Iraq, telling a crowd of students at Ohio State University: &quot;We should go to war with Iraq. It&#x27;s not likely that (Saddam) Hussein will give up his weapons. If he did he would be disgraced in the Arab world.&quot;
In an interview in August 2015, Kasich said: &quot;I would never have committed ourselves to Iraq.&quot; A Kasich spokesman subsequently said that &quot;Kasich was not revising history&quot; but was instead saying that the Iraq War was a mistake given the facts available now.

Kasich has said that the U.S. &quot;should&#x27;ve left a base in Iraq&quot; instead of withdrawing troops in 2011.

In 2015, Kasich said that airstrikes were insufficient to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and he would send U.S. ground troops to fight ISIL.

Kasich opposed the landmark 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran, and in September 2015 was one of fourteen Republican governors who sent a letter to President Obama stating &quot;that we intend to ensure that the various state-level sanctions [against Iran] that are now in effect remain in effect,&quot; despite the agreement.

Kasich has expressed support for the U.S.&#x27;s drone program. He has said, however, that the program should be overseen by the Department of Defense, and not by the CIA.

Kasich has said that he wants to lift budget sequestration for military spending, and &quot;spend more if necessary.&quot;

In November 2015, Kasich said that if elected president, he &quot;would send a carrier battle group through the South China Sea&quot; to send a message to China regarding their claims of sovereignty there.

Kasich supports continued U.S. support of Saudi Arabia, but he criticized Saudi Arabia&#x27;s &quot;funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us&quot;.

Kasich favors strong relations between the U.S. and its NATO allies. He supported Senator John McCain&#x27;s call for maintaining existing U.S. sanctions on Russia, and condemned the Trump administration&#x27;s consideration of lifting sanctions. Like McCain, Kasich supports imposing &quot;tougher sanctions against Russia and Putin&#x27;s inner circle.&quot; He supports a bipartisan investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

===LGBT rights===
By the mid-2010s, Kasich had shown much more support for LGBT rights than many of his Republican counterparts. However, during his time in Congress, Kasich was much less accepting, and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage. During this period, Kasich supported a ban on same-sex marriage in Ohio and stated that he did not approve of the &quot;gay lifestyle.&quot; As governor of Ohio, Kasich signed an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for state employees; this was more narrow than the previous executive order signed by his predecessor because it omitted protections for gender identity.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Kasich struck a more moderate tone compared to his Republican opponents. In June 2015, following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which held that there is a fundamental right to same-sex marriage under the Fourteenth Amendment, Kasich said that he was &quot;obviously disappointed&quot; and that he believes in &quot;traditional marriage,&quot; but that the ruling was &quot;the law of the land and we&#x27;ll abide by it&quot; and that it was &quot;time to move on&quot; to other issues. During his time as Ohio governor, Kasich appointed Richard Hodges as Ohio Director of Health, who was the lead-respondent in the case.

Kasich indicated that he did not support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to overturn the decision. In response to a debate question about how he would explain his position on same-sex marriage to one of his daughters if she were gay, Kasich responded, &quot;The court has ruled, and I said we&#x27;ll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn&#x27;t think the way I do doesn&#x27;t mean that I can&#x27;t care about them or can&#x27;t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re taught when we have strong faith.&quot;

In September 2015, Kasich commented on the highly publicized case of Kim Davis (the Rowan County, Kentucky clerk who refused to comply with a federal court order directing her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples), saying: &quot;Now, I respect the fact that this lady doesn&#x27;t agree but she&#x27;s also a government employee, she&#x27;s not running a church, I wouldn&#x27;t force this on a church. But in terms of her responsibility I think she has to comply. I don&#x27;t think — I don&#x27;t like the fact that she&#x27;s sitting in a jail, that&#x27;s absurd as well. But I think she should follow the law.&quot;

In a March 2018 interview on &quot;The Rubin Report&quot;, Kasich passively came out in support of same-sex marriage saying &quot;I&#x27;m fine with it,&quot; but stated that he now preferred to show himself as someone in the &quot;Billy Graham tradition&quot; that &quot;avoided social issues&quot;. In December 2018, Kasich signed an executive order extending non-discrimination protections for gender identity, including trans and non-binary identities, to state employees in Ohio.

===Gun policy===
While in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kasich had a mixed record on gun policy. He was one of 215 Representatives to vote for the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which became law in 1994, but voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (&quot;Brady Bill&quot;), which established current background check laws.

As governor, Kasich shifted to more pro-gun positions. In 2011, he signed one bill permitting concealed handguns in bars and another making it easier for people with misdemeanor drug convictions to purchase guns. In 2012, Kasich signed a bill allowing gun owners to transport weapons with loaded magazines in their vehicles and expanding concealed carry permit reciprocity. In December 2014, Kasich signed legislation that reduced the numbers of hours of training required to obtain a concealed carry permit and eliminated the training requirement for permit renewals.

After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, Kasich called for restrictions on the sales of AR-15 style rifles.

===Health care===
Kasich opted to accept Medicaid-expansion funding provided by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or &quot;Obamacare&quot;) in Ohio. This decision angered many Statehouse Republicans, who wanted Kasich to reject the expansion.

Total spending on Medicaid by the state was almost $2 billion (or 7.6 percent) below estimates for the fiscal year ending in June 2015, according to a report by Kasich&#x27;s administration. The lower-than-expected costs were attributed to expanded managed care, shorter nursing home stays and increased in-home care for seniors, capitated reimbursement policies, increased automation to determine eligibility for the program and pay care providers, and an improving economy in the state which allowed some participants to move out of the program.

In an October 2014 interview, Kasich said that repeal of the ACA was &quot;not gonna happen&quot; and stated that &quot;The opposition to it was really either political or ideological. I don&#x27;t think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people&#x27;s lives.&quot; Kasich later said that he was referring solely to the law&#x27;s Medicaid expansion, and that &quot;my position is that we need to repeal and replace&quot; the rest of the law. In 2015, Kasich expressed support for many provisions of the ACA (ensuring coverage for people with preexisting conditions, the use of insurance exchanges, and Medicaid expansion), but opposed mandates.

In 2017, after Donald Trump took office and congressional Republicans maneuvered to repeal the ACA, Kasich criticized Republican hard-liners in Congress who demanded a full ACA repeal, saying that full repeal was &quot;not acceptable&quot; when 20 million people gained insurance under the ACA and that doing so would be a &quot;political impossibility.&quot; Kasich urged that the Medicaid expansion be preserved in some form, criticizing the House Republican legislation that would cut the Medicaid expansion and phase out health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans. Kasich said that the nation&#x27;s &quot;soul&quot; was at stake if Republicans passed legislation that left millions without health insurance. After the failure of the House Republican health-care legislation, Kasich met in Washington with members of the Republican Tuesday Group and urged fellow Republicans to work with Democrats to make more modest changes to the Affordable Care Act. In May 2017, Kasich said that the version of the Republican health care bill that passed the House was &quot;inadequate&quot; and would harm patients; Kasich said that Republicans &quot;should&#x27;ve worked with the Democrats&quot; on the bill rather than passing legislation merely to fulfill a campaign pledge.

In June 2017, Kasich said that he didn&#x27;t &quot;have a problem&quot; with gradually phasing out the ACA&#x27;s expansion of Medicaid over a seven-year period, but only if Congress provided states with significantly more, more than the House Republican bill provided for, and only if Congress granted states more authority to manage the program. Along with three other Republican governors (Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, and Rick Snyder of Michigan), Kasich signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with an outline of their wishes for a health care bill. Kasich and the others specifically called upon Congress to &quot;end the requirement that state Medicaid programs cover nearly every prescription drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&quot; Kasich and the other governors&#x27; views were seen as influential, because their states have Republican senators and the Republicans have only a narrow majority in the Senate.

===Immigration and refugees===
In 2010, while running for governor, Kasich expressed support for amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of &quot;jus soli&quot; (birthright) citizenship for people born in the United States. Kasich also told the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; at the time that &quot;One thing that I don&#x27;t want to reward is illegal immigration.&quot;

In 2014, Kasich acknowledged that his stance on immigration has &quot;evolved&quot; because &quot;maybe [I&#x27;m] a little smarter now&quot;, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see anybody in pain. So I guess when I look at this now, I look at it differently than I did in &#x27;10. ... When I look at a group of people who might be hiding, who may be afraid, who may be scared, who have children, I don&#x27;t want to be in a position of where I make it worse for them.&quot; That year, Kasich expressed openness to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, saying at a Republican Governors Association (RGA) meeting in Florida, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line, [but] we may have to do it.&quot; Kasich was the only governor at the RGA conference &quot;to express openly a willingness to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.&quot;

In August 2015, while running for president, Kasich called for a path to legal status (but not necessarily citizenship) for undocumented immigrants and for a guest worker program. Kasich also appeared to disavow his earlier stance against birthright citizenship, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think we need to go there&quot;; called for completion of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border; and noted that undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as young children may obtain driver&#x27;s licenses in Ohio.

In October 2015, Kasich criticized Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and remove immigrants who entered the United States illegally&quot;, calling these notions &quot;just crazy&quot;.

In September 2015, Kasich said that the U.S. had a moral responsibility to accept refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria. Subsequently, however, Kasich moved to the right, and in November 2015 wrote a letter to President Obama asking that no additional Syrian refugees be resettled in Ohio. Kasich opposed Trump&#x27;s executive order on travel and immigration, which Trump signed one week after taking office in January 2017. Kasich said that the order was &quot;ham-handed&quot; because it &quot;sowed so much confusion&quot; and &quot;sent a message that somehow the United States was looking sideways at Muslims&quot;.

===Lieutenant governor===
Kasich has a &quot;long-standing political partnership&quot; with his lieutenant governor, Mary Taylor. In 2014, Kasich defended Taylor after her chief of staff, and that chief of staff&#x27;s administrative assistant, resigned following a timesheet probe. Kasich said of Taylor&#x27;s handling of the matter: &quot;Mary did the right thing and I support her.&quot;

In 2017, the Kasich-Taylor relationship frayed after Taylor abandoned Kasich ally Matt Borges in his bid for chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, and instead chose to support Jane Timken, who was actively supported by Donald Trump, who sought revenge against Kasich for his choice not to endorse Trump. Nevertheless, Kasich indicated that Taylor had &quot;been a good partner&quot; over his term and indicated that he would support her if she chose to run for governor in 2018.

===Racial diversity in Cabinet===
Upon taking office in 2011, Kasich received criticism for appointing an initial all-white cabinet of 22 members. Responding to criticism for not appointing any black, Hispanic, or Asian Cabinet members, Kasich said: &quot;I don&#x27;t look at things from the standpoint of any of these sort of metrics that people tend to focus on, race or age, or any of those things. It&#x27;s not the way I look at things... I want the best possible team I can get.&quot; Shortly afterward, on February 2, 2011, Kasich made his first minority appointment to the Cabinet, naming Michael Colbert, a black man, to lead the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.

, four members of Kasich&#x27;s Cabinet were members of racial minorities.

===Transportation===
Throughout his first gubernatorial campaign, Kasich opposed the Ohio Hub higher-speed passenger rail project (a proposed 258-mile Cleveland-to-Cincinnati train) and promised to cancel it, claiming that it would average speeds of merely 36 mph. In his first press conference following his election victory, Kasich declared &quot;That train is dead...I said it during the campaign: It is dead.&quot;

As governor-elect, Kasich lobbied the federal government to use $400 million in federal dollars allocated for high-speed rail for freight rail projects instead. In a November 2010 letter to Kasich, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood wrote that the federal funding was specifically allocated by the 2009 economic stimulus act for high-speed rail, and could not be used for other purposes. In a December 2010 meeting with President Barack Obama, Kasich again unsuccessfully lobbied to use the grant money for freight rail rather than high-speed rail.

In December 2010, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that Ohio would lose the $385 million in grant funds allocated for high-speed passenger rail, since Kasich had informed them that he had no intention of ever building high-speed rail projects. (Almost $15 million had already been spent for preliminary engineering.) The $385 million was instead diverted to other states, such as California, New York, and Florida, which planned high-speed rail using the grant money for its congressionally intended purpose. Outgoing governor Ted Strickland, who championed the project, expressed disappointment, saying that the loss of funding for the project was &quot;one of the saddest days during my four years as governor&quot; and that &quot;I can&#x27;t understand the logic of giving up these vital, job-creating resources to California and Florida at a time when so many Ohioans need jobs.&quot;

Kasich is an opponent of the Cincinnati Streetcar project.
In April 2015, Kasich signed a two-year transportation budget bill which allocated $7.06 billion for highway construction and maintenance, $600 million to local governments for road and bridge projects, and an additional million over the last budget for public transportation.

===Voting rights===
In February 2014, Kasich signed into law a bill which cut six days from Ohio&#x27;s early voting period, including the &quot;golden week&quot; (a period at the beginning of early voting when voters could both register to vote and cast an in-person absentee ballot). The measures were hotly contested in the state legislature, passing on a party-line vote, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. This measure prompted two federal lawsuits. The first lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio on behalf of the NAACP and League of Women Voters of Ohio, resulted in a settlement in April 2015, in which the state agreed to provide evening and Sunday hours for early voting in elections in Ohio through 2018. The second lawsuit, &quot;Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted&quot;, was brought in May 2015 by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias; plaintiffs argued that the Ohio bill eliminating &quot;golden week&quot; violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately burdened black, Latino and young voters. The federal district court agreed and struck down the legislation, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision in a 2–1 vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. In July 2015, Kasich said that it was &quot;pure demagoguery&quot; for Hillary Clinton to &quot;say that there are Republicans who are deliberately trying to keep people from voting.&quot;
In April 2015, Kasich used his line-item veto power to veto a provision added to a highway-budget bill by Republicans in the state legislature that would have required college students who register to vote in Ohio to obtain a state driver&#x27;s license and vehicle registration, imposing an estimated $75 in motor vehicle costs on out-of-state college students who wanted to vote in the state. The veto was celebrated by voting rights advocates, Ohio Democrats, and the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; editorial board, which viewed the proposal as effectively a &quot;poll tax&quot; motivated by a partisan desire to limit college-town voting.

===Judicial appointments===
In Ohio, justices of the Ohio Supreme Court are elected, but the governor can fill unexpired terms. In May 2012, Ohio Supreme Court Associate Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton announced she would retire at the end of 2012. In December 2012, Kasich appointed Judge Judith L. French to Stratton&#x27;s unexpired term, which ran from January 1, 2013, through January 1, 2015.

===Impeachment of Donald Trump===
On October 18, 2019, Kasich publicly stated that Donald Trump should be impeached. He had previously said there was not enough evidence to impeach the President.

== 2016 presidential campaign ==
In April 2015, Kasich announced the formation of his &quot;New Day For America&quot; group. Formerly a 527 group, it filed as a super PAC in July 2015. Between April 20 and June 30, 2015, the super PAC raised over $11.1 million from 165 &quot;reportable contributions,&quot; including 34 contributions of $100,000 or more. Major contributors to the PAC include Floyd Kvamme, who donated $100,000, and Jim Dicke, chairman emeritus of Crown Equipment Corporation, who donated $250,000. According to FEC filings, Kasich&#x27;s campaign had $2.5 million on hand at the beginning of 2016.

In May 2015, sources close to him had said he was &quot;virtually certain&quot; to run for the Republican nomination for president. On July 21, 2015, Kasich announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination during a speech at the Ohio Union, the student union of his alma mater, the Ohio State University.

On January 30, 2016, the &quot;New York Times&quot; endorsed Kasich for the Republican nomination. The &quot;Times&quot; editorial board strongly rebuked leading candidates Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz and wrote that Kasich, &quot;though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race.&quot;

On the campaign trail, Kasich sought to project a sunny, optimistic message, describing himself as &quot;the prince of light and hope.&quot; This marked a change in tone for Kasich, who had developed a reputation as an abrasive governor. Viewed as a long-shot contender, Kasich took an &quot;above-the-fray approach to his rivals&quot; and &quot;ran unapologetically as a candidate with experience&quot; even as others ran as &quot;outsider&quot; contenders.
Kasich came in second place in the New Hampshire primary on February 9, 2016, behind winner Trump. The &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; reported that this was &quot;the best possible result&quot; for Kasich and lent &quot;credence to the notion that he can emerge&quot; as a Republican alternative to Trump and Cruz.

Ultimately, however, Kasich&#x27;s message &quot;never caught on in a campaign that ... exposed the anger and frustration coursing through the electorate&quot; and he &quot;found himself stuck in fourth place in a three-man race, trailing Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the delegate count&quot; although Rubio had dropped out of the race in March.
The only state won by Kasich was his home state of Ohio, which gave him 66 delegates in its March 2016 winner-take-all primary but still left him with &quot;a steep delegate deficit against his rivals.&quot; Kasich&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign strategy hinged on the possibility of a contested (or brokered) Republican National Convention, in which no single candidate has enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot, something that has not happened in either of the two major parties&#x27; presidential nominating conventions since 1952. Kasich suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on May 4, 2016, one day after Trump won the Republican primary in Indiana. The third remaining contender, Cruz, quit the race shortly before Kasich did, leaving Trump as the only candidate remaining in the Republican field and hence the party&#x27;s presumptive nominee.

A 2018 study on media coverage of the 2016 election noted &quot;the paradox of the Kasich campaign&#x27;s longevity while it lacked public interest provides some evidence for the idea that Kasich&#x27;s biggest supporters were the media&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Following his withdrawal from the race, Kasich did not extend his support to Trump. In May and June 2016, Kasich said that Trump was a divisive figure rather than a &quot;unifier,&quot; said he had no plans to endorse Trump in the near future, and ruled out the possibility of seeking the Vice Presidency as Trump&#x27;s running mate.

Kasich said it was &quot;hard to say&quot; whether he would ever endorse Trump; he added, &quot;I can&#x27;t go for dividing, name calling, or somebody that doesn&#x27;t really represent conservative principles.&quot; Kasich said he had ruled out voting for Clinton but lacked the enthusiasm to fully back Trump.

In August 2016, Kasich repeated an earlier claim that the Trump campaign had offered him a powerful vice presidency, &quot;putting him in charge of all domestic and foreign policy&quot;. The Trump campaign denied that such an offer had been made. Kasich also doubted whether Trump could win Ohio, a critical state in the election. It was speculated that Kasich was looking towards a 2020 campaign. This speculation was strengthened by a report that Kasich had planned to give a speech to the American Enterprise Institute less than 48 hours after the election but cancelled it the morning after the election when it was clear that Trump had won.

Kasich received an electoral vote for the presidency from one faithless elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, who had been pledged to vote for Trump. An elector in Colorado also attempted to vote for him, but that vote was discarded; the elector was replaced by an alternate elector who voted, as pledged, for Clinton.

==Opposition to Trump==
In February 2017, Kasich met with Trump at the White House in a private meeting that followed a bitter feud. Kasich indicated that he hoped for Trump&#x27;s success, but would continue to be critical when he thought it was necessary. The same month, Kasich&#x27;s chief political advisors launched a political group, Two Paths America, in an effort to promote Kasich and his views and draw a contrast with Trump. In April 2017, Kasich also released a book, &quot;Two Paths: America Divided or United&quot;, written with Daniel Paisner. The creation of the group prompted speculation he could possibly run for president again, but Kasich said that he had no plans to seek elected office in the future.

In April 2017, during a CNN town hall, Kasich, while stating that he was &quot;very unlikely&quot; to do so, reopened the possibility that he might run for president in 2020. On August 20, however, he reiterated his previous statement that he had no plans to run; rather, he stated that he was &quot;rooting for [Trump] to get it together.&quot;

In October 2017, during an interview with CNN&#x27;s Jake Tapper, Kasich said he had not &quot;given up&quot; on the Republican Party, but added that &quot;if the party can&#x27;t be fixed ... I&#x27;m not going to be able to support the party. Period. That&#x27;s the end of it.&quot; In March 2018, he told &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; that he was &quot;increasingly open&quot; to running for president in the 2020 presidential election; however, in May 2019, he again declared that he would not seek the presidency in 2020.

In October 2019, Kasich expressed support for the impeachment inquiry against Trump, saying that the &quot;final straw&quot; for him was when Trump&#x27;s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted that Trump had withheld U.S. aid from Ukraine in part to pressure the country to investigate Trump&#x27;s domestic political rivals, a statement that Mulvaney later said was misconstrued.

Kasich confirmed on August 10, 2020, that he would be speaking at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Kasich said that his conscience compelled him to speak out against Trump and in support of Biden, even if it resulted in blowback against him, adding, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a reformer almost all of my life. I&#x27;ve been very independent and I&#x27;m a Republican but the Republican Party has always been my vehicle but never my master. You have to do what you think is right in your heart and I&#x27;m comfortable here.&quot;

In September 2024, Kasich was one of several former governors to sign an open letter to all 50 current governors urging them to certify their states&#x27; votes after the upcoming November election, even if Trump urged them not to.

==Personal life==

Kasich has been married twice. His first marriage was to Mary Lee Griffith from 1975 to 1980, and they had no children. Griffith has campaigned for Kasich since their divorce. Kasich and his current wife, Karen Waldbillig, a former public relations executive, were married in March 1997 and have twin daughters, Emma and Reese.

Kasich was raised a Catholic, but considers denominations irrelevant, while stating that &quot;there&#x27;s always going to be a part of me that considers myself a Catholic.&quot; He drifted away from his religion as an adult, but came to embrace an Anglican faith after his parents were killed in a car crash by a drunk driver on August 20, 1987. He joined the Episcopal Church as an adult. Kasich has said he &quot;doesn&#x27;t find God in church&quot; but does belong to St. Augustine&#x27;s in Westerville, Ohio, which is part of the Anglican Church in North America, a conservative church with which he remained when it broke off from the Episcopal Church.

==Legacy==

Cardinal Hall at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fairgrounds in Columbus, Ohio, was renamed Kasich Hall in 2019 in honor of Kasich.

<doc id="643944" wikidata="Q137727" url="?curid=643944" title="Sakichi Toyoda">
<text>was a Japanese inventor and industrialist who founded Toyoda Automatic Loom Works (later Toyota Industries). The son of a farmer and sought-after carpenter, he started the Toyoda family companies. His son, Kiichiro Toyoda, would later establish Japan&#x27;s largest automaker, Toyota. Toyoda is referred to as the &quot;King of Japanese Inventors&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Sakichi Toyoda was born on March 19 (the 14th of the 2nd month in East Asian Lunar Calendar), 1867, in Yamaguchi, Tōtōmi Province (present-day Kosai, Shizuoka), to Ikichi and Ei Toyoda. Ikichi was a carpenter and a farmer, and he taught carpentry to his son. Sakichi&#x27;s boyhood would coincide with the end of the Edo period, replaced by the Meiji and its reformist policies. Sakichi was an avid reader in his youth, and he organized a youth study group for teens. Inspired by a trip to Ueno to visit the Third National Machinery Exposition, he later revolutionized the textile industry, powered by steam, oil, and electricity.

==Toyoda Automatic Loom Works==
Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was the engineering manufacturing company established by Sakichi Toyoda in 1926. It earned him the moniker of father of the Japanese industrial revolution. He is also the founder of Toyota Industries Co., Ltd.

Toyoda invented and innovated numerous textile-focused weaving devices, introducing innovative fueling systems used to power his Toyoda-branded machines. His most famous invention was the automatic power loom in which he implemented the principle of &quot;Jidoka&quot; (autonomous automation). The principle of &quot;Jidoka&quot;, which means that the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. 

Toyoda developed the concept of 5 Whys: When a problem occurs, ask &quot;why&quot; five times to try to find the source of the problem, then put into place something to prevent the problem from recurring. This concept is used today as part of applying lean methodologies to solve problems, improve quality, and reduce costs.

The luxury vehicle Toyota Century, introduced in 1967, derived its name from the 100th birthday of Sakichi Toyoda.

On April 15, 1973, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

<doc id="643954" wikidata="Q1199171" url="?curid=643954" title="Lake St Clair (Tasmania)">
<text>Lake St Clair or leeawuleena is a natural freshwater lake located in the Central Highlands area of Tasmania, Australia. The lake forms the southern end of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. It has an area of approximately , and a maximum depth of , making it Australia&#x27;s deepest lake.

The lake is fed by Narcissus River, Cuvier River, and Hamilton Creek and marks the start of the River Derwent.

The locality of Lake St Clair is in the local government areas of Central Highlands (24%), Meander Valley (12%), and West Coast (64%). The southern end of the lake is about north-west of the town of Hamilton.

==Geology==

Lake St Clair was formed through glacial erosion, along with the surrounding river valleys.

==History==
Lake St Clair is located on the edge of the Big River Tasmanian Aboriginal nation, and there is evidence that they hunted on the surrounding button grass plains. Numerous small quarries and campgrounds are located nearby, with the closest dated site putting human occupation at 10,000 years ago.

The first European to discover Lake St Clare on Thursday 26 October 1826, was a team of three, led by convict Jorgen Jorgensen. The reason behind the expedition was to identify suitable farming land for the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company.

Previously, in May 1824, The Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company syndicate was formed in London led by its secretary Edward Morrison Curr to promote the company. In April 1825 the Colonial office offered a grant of 250,000 acres of land in the North West of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania). The company was formed, with a subscribed capital of 1,000,000 English pounds, and incorporated by Act of Parliament, with a Royal Charter.

Edward Curr, as the secretary and representative of the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company - Wikipedia, and a member of the Legislative Council of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land., selected Jorgensen to lead the expedition to identify land suitable for the newly formed company. Jorgensen was recommended by Police Superintendent Humphrey of Hobart.

Jorgensen was serving his second term as a convict, but as a former British naval officer could read maps, could set a course by compass, fix map-positions as well as write up a journal for the company. Skills not found in the majority of convicts.

Jorgensen at fourty six years of age, set out on 2 September 1826 with 2 companions, Mark Logan a ticket of leave man (unsupervised convict), and Andy Colvert, a Tasmanian Aboriginal. Each carried a pack of 32 kg in weight, containing provisions for 6 weeks. Jorgensen was also issued with a sword, a compass and a map by a Mr Scott.

The next European explorer to see the lake was surveyor William Sharland in 1832, with George Frankland leading an expedition to it three years later. In 1840 James Calder cut a track from the lake to Macquarie Harbour, followed by another more practical track by Burgess. The Burgess track was maintained and re-cut by miners until 1883 when a new lower level route was discovered, which later became the Lyell Highway.

The area surrounding the lake was used by snarers and hunters from 1860 until the collapse of the fur trade in the 1950s, although it was illegal from 1927 onwards.

In 1937 the Derwent River was dammed just below the lake, and a pumping station installed - enabling Hydro Tasmania to drain the lake up to 6 metres and feed water to the Tarraleah Power Station. The fluctuating water levels have caused erosion and environmental degradation since. The pumphouse was decommissioned in the 1990s, and transformed into a hotel in 2015.

The Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair area was declared a scenic reserve in 1922, a wildlife reserve in 1927, a national park in 1947 and a world heritage area from 1982.

==Geography==
The locality has an area of , of which the lake occupies about in the south-east corner. The Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park occupies all of the locality, plus the locality of Cradle Mountain to the north.

===Climate===
Lake St Clair has a cold Oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on a Subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfc&quot;), with cool to cold weather year-round. Over the period 1990 to 2004, there were on average 33.1 snowy days annually, which can occur in any month of the year. It is very cloudy, particularly in the cooler months, with an average of 75 and 78 hours in June and July. There are 19.4 clear days annually and 163.4 cloudy days.

==Road infrastructure==
The C193 route (Lake St Clair Road) enters from the south-east and runs to the southern shore of the lake, where it ends.

==Tourism==
In 1871, the Tasmanian Guidebook mentioned Lake St Clair as being &quot;admired for its scenery by the few who visit&quot;. By 1900 there was a boatshed, accommodation, improved access and horse paddocks at Cynthia Bay, with the first tourists arriving by car in 1915.

From 1911 the beginnings of the Overland Track to Cradle Mountain began to form, with the route officially blazed by Bert Nichols in 1931.

A guesthouse was built at Cynthia Bay in 1930, followed by improved parking, camping and visitor facilities. The lake has been a popular tourist destination, with most tourists visiting to walk, photograph and learn about the history.

Following a decision by the Tasmanian Government to allow development in national parks and conservation areas an &quot;in principle&quot; permit was granted for the establishment of an &quot;eco-friendly&quot; resort at Pumphouse Point at Lake St Clair; completed in 2015.

<doc id="643955" wikidata="Q3369717" url="?curid=643955" title="Umetaro Suzuki">
<text>was a Japanese scientist, born in what is now part of Makinohara, Shizuoka, Japan. He was a member of the Imperial Academy, and a recipient of the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure and the Order of Culture. His research was among the earliest of modern vitamin research.

==Biography==
Suzuki was born as the second son of a farmer in Haibara District, Shizuoka. He was a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University and subsequently worked as a research scientist at Riken. In 1901, he studied Peptide synthesis at the Humboldt University of Berlin under Emil Fischer. He returned to Japan in 1906, and accepted a post as professor of agricultural chemistry at Tokyo Imperial University in 1907.

In 1910, Suzuki succeeded in extracting a water-soluble complex of micronutrients from rice bran and named it aberic acid, and which had the effect of curing patients of beriberi. He published this discovery in a Japanese scientific journal.

When the article was translated into German, the translation failed to state that it was a newly discovered nutrient, a claim made in the original Japanese article, and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity. Polish biochemist Kazimierz Funk isolated the same complex of micronutrients and proposed the complex be named &quot;&quot; (from &quot;vital amine&quot;) in 1912. In 1935, this compound was refined and correctly described as thiamine.

On April 18, 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

<text>Dargaville () is a town located in the North Island of New Zealand. It is situated on the bank of the Northern Wairoa River in the Kaipara District of the Northland region. Dargaville is located southwest of Whangārei, and north of Auckland.

Dargaville is noted for the high proportion of residents of Croatian descent. The area around it is one of the chief regions in the country for cultivating kūmara (sweet potato) and so Dargaville is known by many locals as the &quot;Kūmara Capital&quot; of New Zealand.

==History and culture==
The town was established by and named after timber merchant Joseph Dargaville (1837–1896), who purchased the then Tunatahi block from local Iwi. Dargaville was founded in 1872, during the 19th-century kauri gum and timber trade.

Dargaville was made a borough in 1908.

The area became known for a thriving industry that included gum digging and kauri logging, which was based mainly at Te Kōpuru, several kilometres south of Dargaville on the banks of the Wairoa River. The river was used to transport the huge logs downstream to shipbuilders and as a primary means of transport to Auckland. Dalmatian migrants were particularly prominent in the kauri gum extraction. After the gum and forestry industries started to decline after 1920, farming, especially dairy became a significant contributor to the economy.

The Wairoa River was the main method of transport around Dargaville until the 1940s. 

Horses last raced at the Dargaville racecourse in 2016. A proposal in 2022 was submitted to redevelop the racecourse into 450 homes. This private plan change was accepted by the Kaipara Council and released for public consultation in July 2022.

The Bank of New Zealand closed its Dargaville branch in 2020. The Dargaville Town Hall had to be closed and partially demolished in 2023 following damage sustained during Cyclone Gabrielle.

The nearby Ripirō Beach has the longest unbroken stretches of sand beach in New Zealand and is largely drivable from one end to the other. This beach is home of the famous local shellfish delicacy the toheroa. Overexploitation in the 1950s and 1960s caused the population of the shellfish to decline so much that public gathering of the shellfish is now prohibited.

Dargaville is the gateway to the Waipoua Forest, a protected forest sanctuary and home of the biggest specimens of kauri tree in New Zealand, Tāne Mahuta (Māori, meaning &quot;Lord of the Forest&quot;) being chief amongst them.

Dargaville is situated by the Wairoa River, with the rural locality of Turiwiri based across the river from the Dargaville Wairoa River Bridge. Dargaville also houses several boat moorings and a central wharf adjacent to the town centre. The river is tidal when it passes through Dargaville.

<text>was a Japanese inventor who developed the first practical Japanese typewriter. He received the Blue Ribbon Award and the Small Asahi Ribbon. Out of the thousands of kanji characters, Sugimoto&#x27;s typewriter used 2,400 of them.

==Biography==
Kyota Sugimoto was born in Okayama Prefecture in 1882. He completed his studies at the Training Institute for Communication Technology in Osaka in 1900. Typewriters were already in common use for English and other languages with small alphabets, but available typewriters for kanji could only type a few of the thousands of characters. Sugimoto studied the frequency of use of kanji characters, and selected 2,400 of them for a typewriter. The characters were arranged in a grid, with a typebar that could move over the grid in two dimensions to select a particular character. The typebar then struck the character against the paper, and returned it to the grid. The paper was held against a platen, similar to existing typewriters.

He obtained the patent rights to the Japanese typewriter that he invented, first in Japan (1915, Patent N° 27877 ) and somewhat later in the USA (1917, Patent N° 1245633 ).

In 1953 he was decorated with the Blue Ribbon Award, and in 1965 he received the Small Asahi Ribbon Award. He died in 1972.

On April 18, 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

<text>Jerusalem Day (, ) is an Israeli national holiday that commemorates the &quot;reunification&quot; of East Jerusalem (including the Old City) with West Jerusalem following the Six-Day War of 1967, which saw Israel occupy East Jerusalem and the West Bank, effectively annexing the former. It is celebrated annually on 28 Iyar on the Hebrew calendar, and is marked officially throughout Israel with state ceremonies and memorial services.

A notable celebration that marks the holiday is a flag-flying parade known as the Dance of Flags. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel declared Jerusalem Day to be a minor religious holiday, as it marks the regaining for Jewish people of access to the Western Wall.

== Historical background ==
Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which proposed the establishment of two states in British Mandatory Palestine – a Jewish state and an Arab state – Jerusalem was to be an international city, neither exclusively Arab nor Jewish for a period of ten years, at which point a referendum would be held by Jerusalem residents to determine which country to join. The Jewish leadership accepted the plan, including the internationalization of Jerusalem, but the Arabs rejected the proposal.

A civil war between Jewish forces and Palestinian Arabs in Mandatory Palestine internationalized in to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the day after Israel declared independence and the surrounding Arab states sent their armies in to the former Mandate territory. Jordan captured East Jerusalem and the Old City while Israel captured the western section of the city. Israeli forces made a concerted attempt to dislodge the Jordanians but were unable to do so, and the war concluded with Jerusalem divided between Israel and Jordan by the Green Line. The Old City and the rest of East Jerusalem, along with the entirety of the West Bank, was occupied by Jordan, who forced the Jewish residents out, while the Palestinian Arab residents of western Jerusalem, at the time one of the more prosperous Arab communities, fled widespread looting and attacks by the Haganah, going from 28,000 to fewer than 750 remaining. Under Jordanian rule, half of the Old City&#x27;s 58 synagogues were demolished and the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives was plundered for its tombstones, which were used as paving stones and building materials.

In 1967, in the Six-Day War, Israel captured and occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank from Jordan on 7 June 1967. Later that day, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan declared what is often quoted during Jerusalem Day:

The war ended with a ceasefire on 11 June 1967 with Israel in control of the entirety of territory of Mandatory Palestine, including all of Jerusalem. On 27 June 1967, Israel expanded the municipal boundaries of West Jerusalem so as to include approximately of territory it had captured in the war, including the entirety of the formerly Jordanian held municipality of East Jerusalem () and an additional 28 villages and areas of the Bethlehem and Beit Jala municipalities . On 30 July 1980, the Knesset officially approved the Jerusalem Law, which called the city the complete and united capital.

== Celebrations ==
On 12 May 1968, the government proclaimed a new holiday – Jerusalem Day – to be celebrated on the 28th of Iyar, the Hebrew date on which the divided city of Jerusalem became one. On 23 March 1998, the Knesset passed the Jerusalem Day Law, making the day a national holiday.

One of the themes of Jerusalem Day, based on a verse from the Psalms, is &quot;Built-up Jerusalem is like a city that was joined together&quot; (Psalm 122:3).

In 1977, the government advanced the date of Jerusalem Day by a week to avoid it clashing with Election Day.

In 2015, Yad Sarah a non-profit volunteer organization began organizing a special tour specifically for residents who use wheelchairs, which focuses on Jerusalem history.

=== 50th anniversary ===

In 2017, the golden jubilee of Jerusalem Day was celebrated. During the course of the year many events marking this milestone took place in celebrations of the 50th Jerusalem Day. Many events were planned throughout the year, marking the jubilee. The main theme of the celebrations was the &quot;Liberation of Jerusalem&quot;. The celebrations began during Hanukkah 2016, at an official ceremony held at the City of David National Park in the presence of Minister Miri Regev, who was responsible for the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary. A logo was created for the jubilee and presented by the minister Miri Regev.

==== Events During the Jubilee Year ====
The ceremony was held at the City of David National Park at the event the ancient &quot;Pilgrims&#x27; Route&quot;, that led from the City of David to the Temple Mount during the Second Temple period, was unveiled. The ceremony was attended by Knesset members, mayors and the three paratroopers that were photographed by David Rubinger at the Western Wall in 1967. At the event, the Minister Miri Regev was quoted by the press as saying, &quot;Mr. President Barack Obama, I am standing here, on Hanukka, on the same road on which my forefathers walked 2,000 years ago... No resolution in any international forum is as strong as the steadfast stones on this street.&quot; Noting several of the 14 countries that participated in the resolution – including New Zealand, Ukraine, Senegal, and Malaysia – the minister added, &quot;no other people in the world has such a connection and link to their land.&quot;

== Significance ==

While the day is not widely celebrated outside Israel, and has lost its significance for most secular Israelis, the day is still very much celebrated by Israel&#x27;s Religious Zionist community with parades and additional prayers in the synagogue.

=== Religious observance ===
Religious Zionists recite special holiday prayers with Hallel. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel ruled in favor of reciting Hallel with a blessing on this day. Rabbi Isser Yehuda Unterman, Ashkenazi chief rabbi at the time, explained this decision as follows: &quot;When the state was declared [in 1948], we asked the Creater of the World a question, and we did not know if our way would succeed. In the six days we received an answer!&quot; Other rabbis (including Rabbis Ovadia Yosef and Joseph B. Soloveitchik) ruled that Hallel should or could be recited only without a blessing, either because Israel was still in danger, or for technical reasons. Today, various communities follow differing practices.

Some Haredim (strictly Orthodox), who do not recognise the religious significance of the State of Israel, do not observe Yom Yerushalayim. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein maintained that adding holidays to the Jewish calendar was itself problematic.

In 2015, Koren Publishers Jerusalem published a machzor dedicated to observance of Jerusalem Day and Independence Day.

== Controversy ==
There has been controversy pertaining to the celebration of Jerusalem Day. The settlement of Eastern Jerusalem and the claim of Jerusalem as a capital for the State of Israel is controversial among the left wing and the Arab population of Jerusalem, who regard it as a day marking the conquest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

One of the celebrations marking Jerusalem Day is a youth parade with flags known as Dance of Flags, which begins at Gan Sacher, winds through the streets of downtown Jerusalem, threads through the old city and ends with a gathering for a final prayer at the Western Wall. The parade is controversial, and violent interactions have been reported between Arabs and Israeli youth during the procession.

In 2014, the Meretz political party submitted a bill to repeal the Jerusalem Day Law.

In May 2015, the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition to prevent the Jerusalem Day parade from marching through the Muslim sector of the city. The justices said, however, that police must arrest parade participants who shout racist and violent epithets such as &quot;Death to the Arabs!&quot; or commit violent acts.

== Ethiopian Jews&#x27; Memorial Day ==
A ceremony is held on Yom Yerushalayim to commemorate the Beta Israel who perished on their way to Israel. In 2004, the Israeli government decided to turn this ceremony into a state ceremony held at the memorial site for Ethiopian Jews who perished on their way to Israel on Mount Herzl.

<doc id="643968" wikidata="Q451062" url="?curid=643968" title="Kotaro Honda">
<text>, born on February 23, 1870, in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture – February 12, 1954) was a Japanese metallurgist and inventor. He invented KS steel (initials from Kichiei Sumitomo), which is a type of magnetic resistant steel that is three times more resistant than tungsten steel. This material, which had 250 oersteds magnetic resistance, was developed through rigorous basic research on steel and alloys. 

Honda was born in the town of Yahagi (part of modern Okazaki, Aichi and was a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University. He was taught by the famous Japanese physicist Hantaro Nagaoka at the University of Tokyo. 

Honda&#x27;s research on KS steel in 1917, and on improved KS steel in 1934 became the basis for his position that Japan&#x27;s industrial development is dependent on basic research in major scientific fields. He later improved upon the steel, creating NKS steel. NKS steel was mentioned by Taiichi Ohno in his book as being one of the Japanese materials whose development was tied to World War II. 

Honda, together with the academic Tokiatsu Hojo, setup up a research institute, which was supported by the Sumitomo family. It was later renamed Metallic Materials Research Institute. In 1931, he was appointed president of Tohoku Imperial University, where he taught physics for several years.

He participated in establishing the (千葉工業大学, &quot;Chiba Institute of Technology&quot;) from 1940. He served as the first president of the Tokyo University of Science from 1949.

Honda was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932, and was one of the first persons to be awarded the Order of Culture when it was established in 1937. He was also awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Elliott Cresson Medal in 1931 and became a Person of Cultural Merit in 1951. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun. 

Honda died in 1954 in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and his grave is at the temple of Myogen-ji in Okazaki.

On April 18, 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

<doc id="643970" wikidata="Q686708" url="?curid=643970" title="Cessna 182 Skylane">
<text>The Cessna 182 Skylane is an American four-seat, single-engined light airplane built by Cessna of Wichita, Kansas. It has the option of adding two child seats in the baggage area.

Introduced in 1956, the 182 has been produced in a number of variants, including a version with retractable landing gear, and is the second-most popular Cessna model still in production after the 172.

==Development==
The Cessna 182 was introduced in 1956 as a tricycle gear variant of the 180. In 1957, the 182A variant was introduced, followed by a deluxe version the following year known as the Skylane. As production continued, later models were improved regularly with features such as a wider fuselage, swept tailfin with rear &quot;omni-vision&quot; window, enlarged baggage compartment, higher gross weights, landing gear changes, etc. The &quot;restart&quot; aircraft built after 1996 were different in many other details including a different engine, new seating design, etc. 

By mid-2013, Cessna planned to introduce the next model of the 182T, designated the JT-A, using the SMA SR305-230 diesel engine running on Jet-A with a burn rate of per hour at cruise speed of . Cessna has no timeline for the JT-A. The normally aspirated, avgas-fueled 182 went out of production in 2012, but came back in 2015.

Cessna 182s were also built in Argentina by DINFIA, as the A182, and in France by Reims Aviation, as the F182.

==Design==
The Cessna 182 is an all-metal (mostly aluminum alloy) aircraft, although some parts – such as engine cowling nosebowl and wingtips – are made of fiberglass or thermoplastic material. Its wing has the same planform as the smaller Cessna 172 and the larger 205/206 series; however, some wing details, such as flap and aileron design, are the same as the 172 and are not like the 205/206 components.

===Retractable gear===

The retractable gear R182 and TR182 were offered from 1978 to 1986, without and with engine turbocharging, respectively. The model designation nomenclature differs from some other Cessna models with optional retractable gear. For instance, the retractable version of the Cessna 172 was designated as the 172RG and the 177RG , whereas the retractable gear version of the Cessna 182 is the R182. Cessna gave the R182 the marketing name of &quot;Skylane RG&quot;.

The R182 and TR182 offer 10-15% improvement in climb and cruise speeds over their fixed-gear counterparts, and similarly, 10-15% better fuel economy at the same speeds at the expense of increased maintenance costs and decreased gear robustness. The 1978 R182 has a sea-level climb rate of and a cruising speed (75% BHP) at of TAS at standard temperature.

The landing-gear retraction system in the Skylane RG uses hydraulic actuators powered by an electrically driven pump. The system includes a gear position warning that emits an intermittent tone through the cabin speaker when the gear is in the retracted position and either the throttle is reduced below about manifold pressure or the flaps are extended beyond 20°. In the event of a hydraulic pump failure, the landing gear may be lowered using a hand pump to pressurize the hydraulic system. The system does not, however, allow the landing gear to be manually retracted.

==Variants==
&quot;Cessna has historically used model years similar to U.S. auto manufacturers, with sales of new models typically starting a few months prior to the actual calendar year.&quot;

<text>Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut (, , ) is Israel&#x27;s national day, commemorating the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948. It is marked by a variety of official and unofficial ceremonies and observances.

Because Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948, which corresponded with the 5th of Iyar on the Hebrew calendar in that year, Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut was originally celebrated on that date. However, to avoid Sabbath desecration, it may be commemorated one or two days before or after the 5th of Iyar if it falls too close to the Sabbath. The day preceding Israel&#x27;s independence day is Yom HaZikaron, which is dedicated to the memory of fallen Israeli soldiers and Israeli civilian victims of terrorism.

In the Hebrew calendar, days begin in the evening; Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut is observed from nightfall until the following evening of the designated day.

== History ==
Israelis observe Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut to commemorate the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which was proclaimed by future Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion on behalf of the Yishuv on 14 May 1948. The mood outside of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s residence just prior to the announcement was joyous: The Jews of Palestine ... were dancing because they were about to realize what was one of the most remarkable and inspiring achievements in human history: A people which had been exiled from its homeland two thousand years before, which had endured countless pogroms, expulsions, and persecutions, but which had refused to relinquish its identity—which had, on the contrary, substantially strengthened that identity; a people which only a few years before had been the victim of mankind&#x27;s largest single act of mass murder, killing a third of the world&#x27;s Jews, that people was returning home as sovereign citizens in their own independent state. The State of Israel was founded eight hours before the termination of the British Mandate for Palestine, which was due to finish on 15 May 1948.

The operative paragraph of the &quot;Declaration of the Establishment of State of Israel&quot; of 14 May 1948 expresses the declaration to be &quot;by virtue of our natural and historic right and on the basis of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly&quot;. The operative paragraph concludes with the words of Ben-Gurion, where he thereby declares &quot;the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel&quot;.

While Israel was quickly granted diplomatic recognition by many countries, including the Soviet Union and the United States, it was not recognized by the Arab League and most Muslim-majority countries. On 15 May, Israel&#x27;s neighbouring Arab countries declared war on it and invaded the territory of the former British Mandate, thus escalating the ongoing 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine into the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. However, this war ended with an Israeli victory amidst the 1949 Armistice Agreements, which established the Green Line as Israel&#x27;s international border.

== Events ==

=== Eve of Independence Day ===
Memorial Day, or Yom Hazikaron, ends at sunset, and is immediately followed by the onset of Independence Day, given that in the Hebrew calendar system, days end and begin at sunset.
An official ceremony is held every year on Mount Herzl, Jerusalem, on the evening of Independence Day. The ceremony includes a speech by the speaker of the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament), artistic performances, a Flag of Israel, forming elaborate structures (such as a Menorah, Magen David) and the ceremonial lighting of twelve torches, one for each of the Tribes of Israel. Every year a dozen Israeli citizens, who made a significant social contribution in a selected area, are invited to light the torches.
Many cities hold outdoor performances in cities&#x27; squares featuring leading Israeli singers and fireworks displays. Streets around the squares are closed to cars, allowing people to sing and dance in the streets.

=== Independence Day ===
* Reception of the President of Israel for honouring excellence in 120 IDF soldiers. The event takes place in the President&#x27;s official residence in Jerusalem.
* International Bible Contest in Jerusalem.
* Israel Prize ceremony in Jerusalem.
* Israel Defense Forces opens some of its bases to the public.
* Israeli Song Festival

From 1948 to 1973 the Israel Defense Forces parade was held on this day.

Israeli families traditionally celebrate with picnics and barbecues. Balconies are decorated with Israeli flags, and small flags are attached to car windows. Some leave the flags hoisted until after Yom Yerushalayim. Israeli Television channels air the official events live, and classic cult Israeli movies and skits are shown.

=== Religious customs ===
In response to widespread public feeling, the Chief Rabbinate in Israel decided during 1950–51 that Independence Day should be given the status of a minor Jewish holiday on which Hallel be recited. Their decision that it be recited (without a blessing) gave rise to a bitter public dispute, with Agudath Israel rejecting the notion of imbuing the day with any religious significance whatsoever, and religious Zionists believing the blessing should be obligatory. The Rabbinate also ruled that they were &quot;unable to sanction instrumental music and dances on this day which occurs during the &quot;sephirah&quot; period.&quot; The recitation of the blessing over Hallel was introduced in 1973 by Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren. The innovation was strongly denounced by his Sephardic counterpart, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, leader of Modern Orthodox Judaism in America.

The Religious Zionist movement created a liturgy for the holiday which sometimes includes the recitation of some psalms and the reading of the haftarah of , which is also read on the last day of Pesach in the Diaspora, on the holiday morning. Other changes to the daily prayers include reciting Hallel, saying the expanded &quot;Pesukei D&#x27;Zimrah&quot; of Shabbat (the same practice that is observed almost universally on Hoshanah Rabbah), and/or blowing the Shofar. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik questioned the Halachic imperative in canonising these changes (it is not clear what his personal practice was regarding the recital of Hallel). In any case, the majority of his students recite Hallel without the blessings. A number of authorities have promoted the inclusion of a version of &quot;Al Hanisim&quot; (for the miracles...) in the Amidah prayer. In 2015 Koren Publishers Jerusalem published a machzor dedicated to observance of Independence Day, in addition to Jerusalem Day.

Most Haredim make no changes in their daily prayers. People affiliated to the Edah HaChareidis mourn the establishment of Israel on Independence Day, claiming that the establishment of a Jewish state before the coming of the Messiah is a sin and heresy. Some even fast on this day and recite prayers for fast days.

The Conservative Movement read the Torah portion of , and include a version of &quot;Al Hanisim&quot; as well as recite full Hallel with the blessings. The Reform Movement suggests the inclusion of &quot;Ya&#x27;aleh V&#x27;yavo&quot; in the Amidah prayer.

In 2015, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin of Efrat founded &quot;Day to Praise&quot;, a global initiative which calls on Christians around the world to join in reciting the Hallel (Psalms 113–118), with the Jewish people, on Israel&#x27;s Independence Day.

== Timing ==
Independence Day is designated to be on the 5th day of Iyar (ה&#x27; באייר) in the Hebrew calendar, the anniversary of the day on which Israeli independence was proclaimed, when David Ben-Gurion publicly read the Israeli Declaration of Independence. The corresponding Gregorian date was 14 May 1948.

=== Sabbath observance ===
In order to avoid conflicts with the Jewish Sabbath, Independence Day is rarely celebrated on the 5th of Iyar itself, and on most years is celebrated a day or two before or after. According to the rules of the Jewish calendar explained in Days of week on Hebrew calendar, the 5th of Iyar can fall on a Monday, a Wednesday, a Friday, or a Saturday. To avoid Sabbath desecration, it was decided in 1951 that if the 5th of Iyar falls on a Friday or Saturday, the celebrations would be moved up to the preceding Thursday (3 or 4 of Iyar). Additionally, since 2004, if the 5th of Iyar is on a Monday, the festival is postponed to Tuesday (6 of Iyar). Monday is avoided in order to avoid potential violation of Sabbath laws by preparing for Yom Hazikaron (which is one day before Independence Day) on a Shabbat. As a result, Independence Day falls between 3 and 6 of Iyar, and can be on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Consequently, the holiday is celebrated on the 5th of Iyar only in years in which the date happens to fall on a Wednesday.

Upcoming Gregorian dates for Independence Day:

== Israeli Arabs ==
While some Israeli Arabs celebrate Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut, others regard it as a tragic day in their history referred to as the Nakba (&quot;the catastrophe&quot;). As early as 1949, and officially since a 1998 proclamation by Yasser Arafat, May 15 has been commemorated as Nakba Day, which rarely coincides with Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut, but falls within a few weeks of it.

<doc id="643982" wikidata="Q1347561" url="?curid=643982" title="Hidetsugu Yagi">
<text>was a Japanese electrical engineer from Osaka, Japan. When working at Tohoku Imperial University, he wrote several articles that introduced a new antenna designed by his assistant Shintaro Uda to the English-speaking world.

The Yagi-Uda antenna, patented in 1926, allows directional transmission using radio waves, and is especially useful in the very high frequency and ultra high frequency radio bands . Antennas of this type were widely used for television and radio reception, and are still common in communication and radar systems. Yagi also tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce a wireless power transmission system. He participated in establishing the Chiba Institute of Technology. He was the fourth president of Osaka University from February 1946 to December 1946.

In 1942, he became the President of Tokyo Institute of Technology, in 1944 he became the President of the Technical Institution, and in 1946 also the President of the Osaka Imperial University. He was decorated with the Medal of Honor with Blue Ribbon Award in 1951, with the Order of Culture in 1956, and posthumously with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1976.

== Biography ==
Hidetsugu Yagi was born on January 28, 1886, in Osaka Prefecture. He graduated from the Department of Electronic Engineering of the Tokyo Imperial University, Faculty of Sciences, in 1909. From 1913 he studied in Germany where he worked with Heinrich Barkhausen on generating CW oscillations by electric arcs; England where he worked with J.A. Fleming who invented the vacuum diode; and the United States where he worked with G. W. Pierce at Harvard who invented the Pierce oscillator which generated a continuous wave. He earned his doctorate from Tokyo Imperial University in 1921. In Germany he continued research on generation of electric waves used for wireless communication. He returned to Japan in 1930.
After 1930, Hidetsugu Yagi was involved, as a adviser, in the operation of the Number Nine Research Laboratory run by Iwakuro Hideo.

== Wireless communication ==

The topic of wireless communication, which he pursued during his studies abroad, would become a research theme to which he would dedicate his entire life. In 1919, he became a professor at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences of the Tohoku Imperial University which was then established and during the same year, he also attained the title of Doctor of Engineering. He was able to foresee that short waves or ultra-short waves would become the main element for communication using radio waves and he aimed his research in this direction. This resulted in the publication of his papers called &quot;Generation of Short Wavelength Waves&quot;, &quot;Measuring Specific Wavelengths with Short Wavelengths&quot;, and other papers. The so-called Yagi antenna is based on these published articles. He invented it as an antenna using his &quot;method for directional electric waves&quot;. He obtained the patent rights to his invention (patent number 69115, issued in 1926).

Because this invention uses a very simple construction, it enabled directional communication with electric waves. This construction is still used basically in any type of antenna which is used today for ultra short or extremely short waves.

On April 18, 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

On January 28, 2016, Google published an animated Google Doodle to honor his work.

<doc id="643985" wikidata="Q2741878" url="?curid=643985" title="Chaos Control (video game)">
<text>Chaos Control is a rail shooter developed by Infogrames Multimedia and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i, MS-DOS, Macintosh, Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1995. The game&#x27;s cutscenes are rendered in a style reminiscent of anime.

An enhanced remake was released exclusively for the Sega Saturn in 1996. In PAL regions it kept the name &quot;Chaos Control&quot;, but the later Japanese release, published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment, was retitled &quot;Chaos Control Remix&quot; to avoid confusion with the previous year&#x27;s Japanese release that had no lightgun support. Both the PAL &quot;Chaos Control&quot; and the Japanese &quot;Chaos Control Remix&quot; included a two-player option.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Chaos Control&quot; is a sci-fi themed rail shooter which puts the player inside the cockpit of a fighter ship. Although the spaceship flight is automated, the player may target freely using an on-screen reticule, timing their shots so that the fighter&#x27;s guns do not overheat. Targets across the game&#x27;s four levels include mech suits, other spaceships and virtual reality constructs, most of which will return fire in an effort to drain the player&#x27;s shields. There are no bonuses or re-charge power-ups for these shields, and play must restart from the beginning of the level if the player&#x27;s ship is destroyed.

Enemy positions are predetermined and unchanging. This - in combination with fixed flight paths - means that the player can seek to learn the game&#x27;s deployment pattern for each level, defeating them through memorization.

&quot;Chaos Control Remix&quot; supports the Saturn&#x27;s Virtua Gun. The CD-i version requires the CD-i&#x27;s Digital Video Cartridge to play.

==Plot==
In the prologue cinematic for &quot;Chaos Control&quot; an alien species discovers Voyager I. When they decipher the Golden Record they decide to attack humanity.

&quot;Chaos Control&quot;&#x27;s protagonist is a pilot named Jessica Darkhill, whose partner was killed earlier in the war against the game&#x27;s antagonists, the alien Kesh Rhan. Beginning in Manhattan, Darkhill must break through the Kesh Rhan defenses, destroy a computer virus of their making, then mount an attack upon the alien mothership in order to save Earth from the alien invasion.

==Reception==
Reviewing the CD-i version, &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;Chaos Control&quot; is a looker, a fun way to waste some time. As far as depth and challenge, though, it doesn&#x27;t deliver the chaos that it should.&quot; They criticized the lack of multiple weapons and rail shooter gameplay as too limited, but praised the heavily detailed backgrounds and the high level of onscreen action. &quot;Next Generation&quot; admired the &quot;spectacular visual results&quot; of the full motion video and stylish animations, but advised that the game would bore anyone who does not enjoy the &quot;straightforward and mindless&quot; gameplay of full motion video-based rail shooters. They scored the game two out of five stars. &quot;GamePro&quot; later awarded it Best CD-i Game of 1995. Power Unlimited gave the CD-i version a score of 85% summarizing: &quot;Chaos Control is a beautiful shoot &#x27;em up for the CD-i, finally with a woman in the leading role. It looks fantastic, it sounds good and the story is compelling. Too bad that, like most games for CD-i, it is very slow.&quot;

Rob Allsetter gave &quot;Chaos Control Remix&quot; 56% in &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot;. Like reviews for the CD-i version, he was pleased with the graphics, citing the polished rendering and sense of depth, but found the gameplay monotonous, since the unrelenting pace prompts the player to simply fire indiscriminately at the screen. He also judged the longevity to be exceptionally low, since the game can be finished in roughly half an hour and the absence of scoring features such as an accuracy ratio leaves it with no replay value.

&quot;Computer Game Review&quot; was sharply critical of &quot;Chaos Control&quot;″s computer version, dubbing it a substandard copy of &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Chaos Control&quot; the 38th-worst computer game ever released.

<text>Hey Dude is an American Western comedy series that aired on Nickelodeon from July 14, 1989, to August 30, 1991, consisting of 65 half-hour episodes produced over five seasons. The TV series &quot;Hey Dude&quot; is set on the fictitious Bar None Ranch in Tucson, Arizona. It portrays the lives of the ranch owner, his son, their ranch hand, and four teenage summer employees. The series is aimed primarily at a teenage audience.

==Premise==
Benjamin Ernst, a divorced, good-natured, somewhat bumbling father from New Jersey, bought the Bar None Dude Ranch seeking escape from his high-pressure job as a New York City accountant. His accident-prone son, Buddy, is displeased with the change of environment, primarily because he is unable to use his skateboard on the desert sand. In Season 1 of the series, the teenage staff consisted of two boys and two girls: Ted, an enterprising troublemaker; Danny, an easy-going Hopi teenager and Ted&#x27;s best friend; girl-next-door Melody; and Brad, a rich girl from Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Though Brad often wears dressy designer outfits at work, she is a competent horse rider. Her love-hate relationship with Ted is a plot thread during the first half of the series. After David Lascher left the show during Season 3 in 1990, Ted was replaced by Ernst&#x27;s nephew Jake, an eccentric slacker who likes to play the drums. Not long after, Kyle, a somewhat dim but handsome cowboy type, joined the ranch. When Ted returned to the show, he and Kyle became romantic rivals for Brad. The show&#x27;s only other featured adult is Lucy, a tough, authoritative ranch hand. She is sometimes viewed as a mother figure to the teens and they often ask her for advice. Each episode begins with a cold open that usually ends with a pun. After that, the show&#x27;s logo appears over the end of the cold open. Each character is then introduced as a horseshoe flips, followed again by the show&#x27;s logo, after which the opening sequence fades out. Each episode ends with an instrumental version of the show&#x27;s theme song while the credits roll over stills from the episode.

==Characters==

* David Brisbin as Benjamin Ernst Sr., a ranch owner who is also a successful accountant in New Jersey.
* Kelly Brown as Bradley &quot;Brad&quot; Taylor, a riding instructor from a rich Grosse Pointe, Michigan family
* Debra Kalman as Lucy, ranch hand foreman and supervisor
* David Lascher as Ted McGriff, senior staff
* Christine Taylor as Melody Hanson, lifeguard and dance instructor from Allentown, Pennsylvania
* Joe Torres as Danny Lightfoot, a Hopi teenager. 
* Geoffrey Coy as Kyle Chandler, Lucy&#x27;s ex-boyfriend&#x27;s son
* Jonathan Galkin as Jake Decker, Mr. Ernst&#x27;s nephew from Los Angeles, California
* Josh Tygiel as Benjamin &quot;Buddy&quot; Ernst Jr., Mr. Ernst&#x27;s son who is spending the summer with his father in the ranch. 
* Cassie, Buddy&#x27;s dog, was featured in Season 1, but was absent in Season 2

David Lascher and Joe Torres were nominated for a 1991 Young Artist Award in the Best Youth Variety or Game Show category for their roles on &quot;Hey Dude&quot;.

== Production ==
&quot;Hey Dude&quot; was videotaped on location at the Tanque Verde Guest Ranch in Tucson, Arizona. The show was produced by Cinetel Productions. Casting began in 1988 with local auditions held in Tucson. Josh Tygiel, who was cast as protagonist Buddy Ernst, was one of 120 Tucson-area boys who auditioned for the series. Joe Torres was cast as Danny Lightfoot after auditioning in Tucson for the role.

While most of the show was technically shot on the property of the Tanque Verde Guest Ranch, the familiar &quot;ranch&quot; that was known to television viewers was actually built from scratch roughly a mile away from the main public areas. This was done so ranch guests would not be bothered by the production and to create buildings with a more &quot;western&quot; look, which was not offered by the relatively modern and luxurious Tanque Verde. The main lodge, boys and girls bunks, guest lodge (which doubled as cast dressing rooms) and the stable were all built specifically for the production.

After the show ended production, the buildings were abandoned and several are still standing to this day, albeit in much disrepair. The swimming pool that was frequently used on the show is the main pool for the Tanque Verde Guest Ranch and is still in use by guests. The set is located at , about fifteen miles east of Tucson, Arizona.

==Episodes==
The series ran for 65 episodes over two years from 1989 to 1991. Each season take place over the course of one summer in the lives of ranch staff, with cast members often recalling pranks and colleagues from previous summers.

<text>The exposed geology of the Bryce Canyon area in Utah shows a record of deposition that covers the last part of the Cretaceous Period and the first half of the Cenozoic era in that part of North America. The ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now Bryce Canyon National Park varied from the warm shallow sea (called the Cretaceous Seaway) in which the Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited to the cool streams and lakes that contributed sediment to the colorful Claron Formation that dominates the park&#x27;s amphitheaters.

Other formations were also formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70 million years ago (Mya). This event raised the Rocky Mountains far to the east and caused the retreat of the sea that covered the Bryce Canyon area. After Laramide mountain building came to an end, about 15 mya, a large part of western North America began to be stretched into the nearby Basin and Range topography. The greater Bryce area was uplifted as part of the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5 mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.

The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the Grand Staircase. The oldest members of this super sequence of rock units are exposed in the Grand Canyon, the intermediate ones in Zion National Park, and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.

==Grand Staircase==

The Grand Staircase is a sequence of sedimentary rock layers, first defined in the 1870s, that stretch south for from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park and into the Grand Canyon. Bryce Canyon is located within the Pink Cliffs, the highest and youngest rise within the Grand Staircase.

==Cretaceous Seaway==
===Advance===

In the Cretaceous, a shallow seaway spread into the interior of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from being part of the Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay on top of each other as a result.

Conglomerate, siltstone, and fossil-rich sandstone that together are up to thick mark the arrival of the Cretaceous Seaway. Called the Dakota Sandstone, it is the oldest formation exposed in the Bryce Canyon area but the youngest one exposed in the Zion and Kolob canyons area to the southwest. Abundant amounts of petrified wood, oyster beds containing millions of fossils, and coal are all found in the Dakota. In the Bryce Canyon area, this formation can be seen in the Paria Valley where it is found as a lithified blanket sand that probably accumulated on beaches, in lagoons, and vast coal-producing swamps as the Cretaceous Seaway transgressed (advanced inland) over the region and later retreated. It sits unconformably on much older Jurassic formations that are not exposed in the immediate area (see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area for a discussion about these older sediments).

Mud and silt were deposited on top of the Dakota Formation as the seaway became deeper and calmer in the area. The resulting dark gray to black Tropic Shale records the maximum transgression of the seaway into Utah and is thick in the Paria Amphitheater. It forms the unvegetated badlands seen in the Tropic Valley and is perhaps the most fossil-rich formation in the area; containing numerous straight-shelled and coiled ammonites.

===Retreat===
The Cretaceous Seaway was already retreating east and to the south by the time the locally thick Straight Cliffs Formation was deposited. Its members represent various stages in this process. The cliff-forming sandstone of the Tibbet Canyon Member was conformably deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments. Shale and sandstone from the Smoky Hollow Member were deposited on top of its basal layer of coal-rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on the shore of the seaway. While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps, lagoons and fluvial environments, one member, the Drip Tank, is not found in the Bryce Canyon area. This formation erodes into almost unclimbable cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow-gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone. Shark teeth are found in the lower parts of the formation.

Lakes and east-flowing rivers became the dominant resting place for sediment following the retreat of the Cretaceous Seaway. The shales and sandstones of the locally thick Wahweap Formation were deposited in moving water (fluvial setting). This formation is part of the Grey Cliffs of the Grand Staircase mentioned previously. It contains abundant fossils of vertebrates, including dinosaurs such as the hadrosaurs.

==Continental deposition==
===Flood plains uplift and erode===

A flood plain crossed by rivers and lakes developed in the area. Mud and sand accumulated in this setting to become the gray sandstones and mudstones of the Kaiparowits Formation. This formation is up to thick in the Bryce Canyon area, but other parts of the Kaiparowits in the region are several hundreds of feet (tens of meters) thick. Two formations, the Canaan Peak and the Pine Hollow, sit on top of the Kaiparowits elsewhere in the region but are absent in the Bryce Canyon area. The sandstones and conglomerates of these formations record stream and river deposition starting in the Paleocene epoch.

Uplift caused by a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70 mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them gradually subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land in the area to form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline&#x27;s crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline&#x27;s crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed as a result of the Laramide.

===Claron flood plain and lake system ===
Uplift from the Laramide paused briefly in the Eocene. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the resulting broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains. Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant. Oxidation of the iron in the mud and silt turned the soil into hematite, giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up-to- -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park&#x27;s fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos. Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide-rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance.
A large system of shallow but expansive lakes and associated deltas covered several thousand square miles of what is now northwest Colorado and southwest Utah and Wyoming. These lakes existed from the Paleocene to mid Oligocene but did not spread to the Bryce Canyon area until Eocene time. Large quantities of lakebed sediments were laid down in this system during the 20 million years of its existence from about 60 to 40 mya. Climate change and cycles caused the lakes in the system to expand and shrink through time. As they did so, they left beds of differing thickness and composition stacked atop one another;
*various sand and cobble deposits near shore,
*calcium-poor muds further from shore,
*calcium-rich mud in deeper water, and
*pure limey oozes were deposited in the deepest waters.
The limey oozes and mud were later lithified into the limestone and interbedded siltstone of the up-to-300 foot (90 m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths that are found only at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron.

===Marysvale volcanics===
A gap in the geologic record following deposition of the Claron Formation was interrupted 34 to 31 mya by eruptions from the nearby Marysvale volcanic field, which is located northwest of the park. Volcanic ash and lava from these flows are found less than from Bryce Canyon but at least some volcanic material was likely deposited directly in the park area only to be later removed by erosion.

Most of the activity at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~34–22 mya, 22–14 mya and 9–5 mya. Dacites and andesites were erupted above an evolving batholith in the first interval. Crystal-rich ash from the 27-million-year-old (myo) Three Creeks caldera, 24 myo Big John caldera and 23 myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites. Alkali-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19 myo Mount Belknap caldera.

The Marysvale volcanic field collapsed under its own weight around 20 mya; likely due to weaknesses in the evaporites of the Carmel Formation some below. Folding and faulting of the Claron Formation from the collapse created Ruby&#x27;s Inn thrust. A slight downwarp running east–west and perpendicular to the thrust motion called the Bryce syncline was also created. Volcanic activity in the Marysvale and Bryce area ceased some 500,000 years ago. Basaltic rocks of the same age can be seen along the Sevier Fault near the entrance to Red Canyon; the dark colored volcanic rocks have been displaced by the fault some and are now in direct contact with the much older Claron Formation.

==Late Cenozoic tectonics==
===Formation of the High Plateaus===

Younger rock units were laid down but were mostly removed by subsequent uplift-accelerated erosion. Outcrops of these formations can be found in the northern part of the park and in a few places on the plateau rim. Among these are the thick Oligocene or Miocene-aged Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Pliocene to early Pleistocene-aged Sevier River Formation. The Boat Mesa is made mostly of conglomerates with minor amounts of sandstone and some limestone from lakes, representing stream and overbank flood deposits. The brownish-gray sandstone and gravels of the Sevier River Formation were laid down in valleys that were part of the ancestral Sevier River drainage system.

Around 15 mya in Miocene time, tensional forces in Nevada to the west were so great that the crust was spread thin, creating the Basin and Range Province. These same forces segmented what is now the western part of the Colorado Plateau into nine different smaller plateaus, including the Paunsaugunt that the park sits astride. Long, north–south-trending normal faults were either newly created or reactivated from older pre-existing faults; a plateau rose on one side of each fault while valleys subsided on the other as the crust was extended in an east–west direction. Two of these faults bound the Paunsaugunt Plateau; the Sevier on the west and the Paunsaugunt on the east. Movement along these two faults has displaced the Claron Formation by 2,000 feet (600 m) relative to the Paria and Sevier valleys.

The Hurricane Fault marks the west edge of the Markagunt Plateau and is the topographic boundary between the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateaus provinces. Cedar Breaks National Monument, which shares almost the same exposed geology and erosional features as Bryce Canyon National Park, sits on the west edge of the Markagunt.

The entire Colorado Plateau then started to uplift from near sea level to several thousand feet (over a kilometer) in elevation. An alternate theory is that the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.

===Modern drainage and erosion===

Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was significantly altered by the opening of the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5 mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river&#x27;s headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.

Formation of approximately the current depth of the Colorado River&#x27;s Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward erosion of one of those tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today.

==Hoodoo formation in Bryce Canyon==

The Pink Member of the Claron Formation is largely composed of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone. When rain combines with carbon dioxide it forms a weak solution of carbonic acid. This acid helps to slowly dissolve the limestone in the Claron Formation grain by grain. It is this process of chemical weathering that rounds the edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles.

In the winter, melting snow seeps into cracks and joints and freezes at night. The force of the expanding ice helps to erode the rock of the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.

Internal layers of mudstone, conglomerate and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are more resistant to attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.

However, the same processes that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In the case of Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos&#x27; rate of erosion is 2–4 feet (0.6–1.3 m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing of this can be observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal called the Tropic Ditch has been taking some or all of water from the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.

<doc id="644002" wikidata="Q658684" url="?curid=644002" title="Alnico">
<text>Alnico is a family of iron alloys which, in addition to iron are composed primarily of aluminium (Al), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co), hence the acronym &quot;al-ni-co&quot;. They also include copper, and sometimes titanium. 
Alnico alloys are ferromagnetic, and are used to make permanent magnets. Before the development of rare-earth magnets in the 1970s, they were the strongest permanent magnet type. Other trade names for alloys in this family are: &quot;Alni, Alcomax, Hycomax, Columax&quot;, and &quot;Ticonal&quot;.

The composition of alnico alloys is typically 8–12% Al, 15–26% Ni, 5–24% Co, up to 6% Cu, up to 1% Ti, and the rest is Fe. The development of alnico began in 1931, when T. Mishima in Japan discovered that an alloy of iron, nickel, and aluminum had a coercivity of 
, double that of the best magnet steels of the time.

==Properties==
Alnico alloys can be magnetised to produce strong magnetic fields and have a high coercivity (resistance to demagnetization), thus making strong permanent magnets. Of the more commonly available magnets, only rare-earth magnets such as neodymium and samarium-cobalt are stronger. Alnico magnets produce magnetic field strength at their poles as high as 1500 gauss (0.15 tesla), or about 3000 times the strength of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Some alnico brands are isotropic and can be efficiently magnetized in any direction. Other types, such as alnico 5 and alnico 8, are anisotropic, each having a preferred direction of magnetization, or orientation. Anisotropic alloys generally have greater magnetic capacity in a preferred orientation than isotropic types. Alnico&#x27;s remanence (Br) may exceed 12,000 G (1.2 T), its coercivity (Hc) can be up to 1000 oersteds (80 kA/m), its maximum energy product ((BH)max) can be up to 5.5 MG·Oe (44 T·kA/m). Therefore, alnico can produce a strong magnetic flux in closed magnetic circuits, but has relatively small resistance against demagnetization. The field strength at the poles of any permanent magnet depends very much on the shape and is usually well below the remanence strength of the material.

Alnico alloys have some of the highest Curie temperatures of any magnetic material, around , although the maximal working temperature is typically limited to around . They are the only magnets that have useful magnetism even when heated red-hot. This property, as well as its brittleness and high melting point, results from the strong tendency toward order due to intermetallic bonding between aluminum and other constituents. They are also one of the most stable magnets if handled properly. Alnico magnets are electrically conductive, unlike ceramic magnets. Alnico 3 has a melting temperature of 1200 - 1450 °C.

As of 2018, Alnico magnets cost about 44 USD/kg (US$20/lb) or US$4.30/BHmax.

==Classification==
Alnico magnets are traditionally classified using numbers assigned by the Magnetic Materials Producers Association (MMPA), for example, alnico 3 or alnico 5. These classifications indicate chemical composition and magnetic properties. (The classification numbers themselves do not directly relate to the magnet&#x27;s properties; for instance, a higher number does not necessarily indicate a stronger magnet.)

These classification numbers, while still in use, have been deprecated in favor of a new system by the MMPA, which designates Alnico magnets based on maximum energy product in megagauss-oersteds and intrinsic coercive force as kilo oersted, as well as an IEC classification system.

==Manufacturing process==

Alnico magnets are produced by casting or sintering processes. Cast alnico is produced by conventional methods using resin bonded sand molds, which can be intricate and detailed, thereby allowing for complex shapes to be produced. The produced alnico magnet typically has a rough surface. This process has higher initial tooling costs for mold creation. Sintered alnico magnets are formed using powdered metal manufacturing methods. While sintering can also produce a range of shapes, it may not be as suitable for extremely intricate or detailed designs compared to casting.

Most alnico produced is anisotropic, meaning that the magnetic direction of the grains is randomly oriented when initially made. Anisotropic alnico magnets are oriented by heating above a critical temperature and cooling in the presence of a magnetic field. Both isotropic and anisotropic alnico require proper heat treatment to develop optimal magnetic properties. Without it, alnico&#x27;s coercivity is about 10 Oe, comparable to technical iron, a soft magnetic material. After the heat treatment alnico becomes a composite material, named &quot;precipitation material&quot;—it consists of iron- and cobalt-rich precipitates in a rich-NiAl matrix.

Alnico&#x27;s anisotropy is oriented along the desired magnetic axis by applying an external magnetic field to it during the precipitate particle nucleation, which occurs when cooling from to , near the Curie point. There are local anisotropies of different orientations without an external field due to spontaneous magnetization. The precipitate structure is a &quot;barrier&quot; against magnetization changes, as it prefers few magnetization states requiring much energy to get the material into any intermediate state. Also, a weak magnetic field shifts the magnetization of the matrix phase only and is reversible.

==Uses==
Alnico magnets are widely used in industrial and consumer applications where strong permanent magnets are needed. Examples are electric motors, electric guitar pickups, microphones, sensors, loudspeakers, magnetron tubes, and cow magnets. In many applications they are being superseded by rare-earth magnets, whose stronger fields (Br) and larger energy products (B·Hmax) allow smaller-size magnets to be used for a given application.

The high-temperature resistance of alnico magnets leads to many uses that cannot be filled by less resistant magnets, such as in magnetic stirring hotplates.

<doc id="644005" wikidata="Q14136184" url="?curid=644005" title="Fair value">
<text>In accounting, fair value is a rational and unbiased estimate of the potential market price of a good, service, or asset. The derivation takes into account such objective factors as the costs associated with production or replacement, market conditions and matters of supply and demand. Subjective factors may also be considered such as the risk characteristics, the cost of and return on capital, and individually perceived utility.

==Economic understanding==
=== Market price ===
There are two schools of thought about the relation between the market price and fair value in any form of market, but especially with regard to tradable assets:
* The efficient-market hypothesis asserts that, in a well organized, reasonably transparent market, the market price is generally equal to or close to the fair value, as investors react quickly to incorporate new information about relative scarcity, utility, or potential returns in their bids; see also Rational pricing.
* Behavioral finance asserts that the market price often diverges from fair value because of various, common cognitive biases among buyers or sellers. However, even proponents of behavioral finance generally acknowledge that behavioral anomalies that may cause such a divergence often do so in ways that are unpredictable, chaotic, or otherwise difficult to capture in a sustainable profitable trading strategy, especially when accounting for transaction costs.

===Market value===
The latest edition of International Valuation Standards (IVS 2017), clearly distinguishes between fair value (now referred to as &quot;equitable value&quot;), as defined in the IVS, and market value, as defined in the IVS:

:So as the term is generally used, &quot;Fair Value&quot; can be clearly distinguished from &quot;Market Value&quot;. It requires the assessment of the price that is fair between two specific parties taking into account the respective advantages or disadvantages that each will gain from the transaction. Although &quot;Market Value&quot; may meet these criteria, this is not necessarily always the case. &quot;Fair Value&quot; is frequently used when undertaking due diligence in corporate transactions, where particular synergies between the two parties may mean that the price that is fair between them is higher than the price that might be obtainable on the wider market. In other words &quot;Special Value&quot; may be generated. &quot;Market Value&quot; requires this element of &quot;Special Value&quot; to be disregarded, but it forms part of the assessment of &quot;Fair Value&quot;.

==Accounting==
In accounting, fair value reflects the market value of an asset (or liability) for which price on an active market may or may not be determinable. Under US GAAP (ASC 820 formerly FAS 157) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 13), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This is used for assets whose carrying value is based on mark-to-market valuations; for assets carried at historical cost, the fair value of the asset is not recognized.
*Determining fair value for an item traded on an active market such as a security (stock, bond, derivative, etc.), industrial commodity (natural gas, crude oil, copper, etc.) or agricultural commodity (sugar, wheat, pork cutouts, etc.) is straight forward. Fair value simply equals market value on the measurement date (see level one fair value below). 
*Determining fair value for an item (initially) sold on a market but not (subsequently) traded on an active market (a car, truck, machine, computer, dishwasher, etc.) is more difficult as it requires assessing not only the item&#x27;s specifications, age and condition but also market conditions (see level two fair value below).
*Determining fair value for an item neither (initially) sold on a market nor (subsequently) traded on an active market (for example a custom built production line or family residence) is much more difficult and requires assessing &quot;unobservable inputs&quot; (see level three fair value below).
*An example of where fair value is very difficult to determine would be a college kitchen with a cost of $2 million which was built five years ago. If the owners wanted to put a fair value measurement on the kitchen it would be a subjective estimate because there is no active market for such items or items similar to it.
*In another example, if ABC Corporation purchased a two-acre tract of land in 1980 for $1 million, then a historical-cost financial statement would still record the land at $1 million on ABC&#x27;s balance sheet. If XYZ purchased a similar two-acre tract of land in 2005 for $2 million, then XYZ would report an asset of $2 million on its balance sheet. Even if the two pieces of land were virtually identical, ABC would report an asset with one-half the value of XYZ&#x27;s land; historical cost is unable to identify that the two items are similar. This problem is compounded when numerous assets and liabilities are reported at historical cost, leading to a balance sheet that may be greatly undervalued. If, however, ABC and XYZ reported financial information using fair-value accounting, then both would report an asset of $2 million. The fair-value balance sheet provides information for investors who are interested in the current value of assets and liabilities, not the historical cost.

===Fair value measurements (United States markets)===
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157: Fair Value Measurements (&quot;FAS 157&quot;) in September 2006 to provide guidance about how entities should determine fair value estimations for financial reporting purposes. FAS 157 broadly applies to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements. However, application to nonfinancial assets and liabilities was deferred until 2009. Absence of one single consistent framework for applying fair value measurements and developing a reliable estimate of a fair value in the absence of quoted prices has created inconsistencies and incomparability. The goal of this framework is to eliminate the inconsistencies between balance sheet (historical cost) numbers and income statement (fair value) numbers.

Along with all other standards, FAS 157 was codified FASB Accounting Standards Codification as (ASC) Topic 820 (Fair Value Measurement), which defines fair value as &quot;The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.&quot; This is sometimes referred to as &quot;exit value&quot;. In the futures market, fair value is the equilibrium price for a futures contract. This is equal to the spot price after taking into account compounded interest (and dividends lost because the investor owns the futures contract rather than the physical stocks) over a certain period of time. On the other side of the balance sheet the fair value of a liability is the amount at which that liability could be incurred or settled in a current transaction.

Topic 820 emphasizes the use of market inputs in estimating the fair value for an asset or liability. Quoted prices, credit data, yield curve, etc. are examples of market inputs described by Topic 820. Quoted prices are the most accurate measurement of fair value; however, many times an active market does not exist so other methods have to be used to estimate the fair value on an asset or liability. Topic 820 emphasizes that assumptions used to estimate fair value should be from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. This necessitates identification of the market in which the asset or liability trades. If more than one market is available, Topic 820 requires the use of the &quot;most advantageous market&quot;. Both the price and costs to do the transaction must be considered in determining which market is the most advantageous market.

:Specifically ASC 820-10-35-24A outlines valuation techniques (approaches): the market approach, cost approach, and income approach. The inputs for the techniques, in hierarchical (ASC 820-10-35-37) order, are broken down into three levels.

:Level 1 inputs (ASC 820-10-35-40 to 46) &quot;quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.&quot; This implies that the item being evaluated is traded on an active market. An example would be a stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the identical assets or liabilities being valued, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets. If available, a quoted market price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities should be used. To use this level, the entity must have access to an active market for the item being valued. In many circumstances, quoted market prices are unavailable. If a quoted market price is not available, preparers should make an estimate of fair value using the best information available in the circumstances. The resulting fair value estimate would then be classified in Level Two or Level Three.

:Level 2 inputs (ASC 820-10-35-47 to 51A) &quot;inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.&quot; This is &quot;valuation&quot; based on &quot;market observables&quot;. FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist, they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations: The first involves less-active markets for identical assets and liabilities; this category is ranked lower because the market consensus about value may not be strong. The second arises when the owned assets and owed liabilities are similar to, but not the same as, those traded in a market. In this case, the reporting company has to make some assumptions about what the fair value of the reported items might be in a market. The third situation exists when no active or less-active markets exist for similar assets and liabilities, but some observable market data is sufficiently applicable to the reported items to allow the fair values to be estimated.

:For instance, the price of an option based on Black–Scholes and market implied volatility. Within this level, fair value is estimated using a valuation technique. Significant assumptions or inputs used in the valuation technique requires the use of inputs that are observable in the market. Examples of observable market inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets, interest rates, yield curve, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, etc. In addition, assumptions used in estimating fair value must be assumptions that an unrelated party would use in estimating fair value. Notably, FASB indicates that assumptions enter into models that use Level 2 inputs, a condition that reduces the precision of the outputs (estimated fair values), but nonetheless produces reliable numbers that are representationally faithful, verifiable and neutral.

:Level 3 inputs (ASC 820-10-35-52 to 54A) &quot;unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.&quot; Both level 1 and level 2 inputs are objective, in that they are observable. In contrast, level 3 inputs are subjective, often relying on an entity&#x27;s own, internally generated data. &quot;A reporting entity shall develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the reporting entity’s own data.&quot; (ASC 820-10-35-54A). However, although the entity uses its own data, the estimate must continue to reflect how an unrelated market participant would use this unobservable data to determine fair value. Specifically: &quot;unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk&quot; (ASC 820-10-35-53). Thus, when using its own, internally generated data, an entity must proceed in an unbiased and neutral way, rather than trying to cast the data in the best (or worst) possible light. Consequently, whenever level 3 inputs are used, both the company&#x27;s management and independent auditor must take great care to not allow bias to color their assessments. 

:FASB explains that “observable inputs” are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants. In contrast, “unobservable inputs” are not based on independent sources but on “the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use.” The entity may only rely on internal information if the cost and effort to obtain external information is too high. In addition, financial instruments must have an input that is observable over the entire term of the instrument. While internal inputs are used, the objective remains the same: estimate fair value using assumptions a third party would consider in estimating fair value. Also known as mark to management. Despite being “assumptions about assumptions,” Level 3 inputs can provide useful information about fair values (and thus future cash flows) when they are generated legitimately and with best efforts, without any attempt to bias users’ decisions.

ASC 820-10-55 provides additional guidance on how to apply the valuation techniques (approaches). 

:A market approach &quot;uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable (that is, similar) assets, liabilities, or a group of assets and liabilities&quot; Both level one and level two inputs can be used with this approach.

:A cost approach &quot;reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset (often referred to as current replacement cost).&quot; While level 1 inputs could be used, level 2 inputs are more common. For example, a company could estimate the fair value of a three year old vehicle by evaluating the blue book price for similar, three year old vehicles. Likewise, level 3 inputs could also be used. For example, a company could estimate the fair value of a production line by estimating the cost of replacing that production line by adding up parts (including purchased equipment and machines), labor, services such as designers, and all other costs associated with acquiring this type of asset.

:An income approach &quot;converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted) amount.&quot; Unlike the previous two techniques, the income approach relies almost exclusively on level three inputs (although exception include models such as the Black-Scholes-Merton or lattice models which also use level 1 and 2 inputs). Converting future cash flows to a current amount requires discounting. In general, there are two methods that can be used: the risk adjusted discount rate method (a.k.a. discount rate adjustment technique) and a risk adjusted cash flow method (a.k.a. expected cash flow or Con 7 method, named after Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts 7 which introduced it into US GAAP). In addition, ASC 820-10-55-3G.c also mentions the multiperiod excess earnings method. Of all the valuation techniques, this is the most subjective as it requires estimating what earnings would be if an asset (most often an intangible asset) had not been acquired, comparing them to earnings if the asset had been acquired, and discounting the difference (taking into account the associated risks).

The FASB, after extensive discussions, has concluded that fair value is the most relevant measure for financial instruments. In its deliberations of Statement 133, the FASB revisited that issue and again renewed its commitment to eventually measuring all financial instruments at fair value.

FASB published a staff position brief on October 10, 2008, in order to clarify the provision in case of an illiquid market.

=== International standards (IFRS) ===

IFRS 13, &quot;Fair Value Measurement&quot;, was adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board on May 12, 2011. IFRS 13 provides guidance for how to perform fair value measurement under IFRS and became effective on January 1, 2013. The guidance has been converged with US GAAP. IFRS defines fair value as &quot;The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.&quot; As a result, IFRS 13 requires entities to consider the effects of credit risk when determining a fair value measurement, e.g. by calculating a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) or debit valuation adjustment (DVA) on their derivatives;
see 

While ASC 820 and IFRS 15 have been converged and so provide comparable guidance, US GAAP and IFRS apply this guidance in different ways. For example, under US GAAP (ASC 360), entities are not allowed present any property, plant or equipment at fair value. Under IFRS, IAS 16 allows entities to choose between a cost (IAS 16.30) and revaluation (IAS 16.31 to 42) model. If an entity applies the revaluation model, it will measure and report its property plant and equipment at fair value on its balance sheet. It will report the changes in fair value in comprehensive income and accumulate them as a &quot;revaluation surplus&quot; in equity. With respect to investment property (real property held for rent or sale), IFRS takes an additional step. IAS 40.32 requires all entities to measure investment property at fair value. An entity may choose to report this fair value on its balance sheet (fair value model) or disclose it in the footnotes (cost model). If the entity chooses to apply the fair value model, &quot;A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment property shall be recognised in profit or loss for the period in which it arises.&quot; (IAS 40.35). Depending on the choices made, the financial results of an entity applying IFRS may significantly differ from the financial results of an otherwise comparable entity applying US GAAP.

<doc id="644006" wikidata="Q1454006" url="?curid=644006" title="Master of Magic">
<text>Master of Magic is a single-player, fantasy turn-based 4X strategy game in which the player plays as a wizard attempting to dominate two linked worlds. From a small settlement, the player manages resources, builds cities and armies, and researches spells, growing an empire and fighting the other wizards.

The game was developed by Simtex and published by MicroProse for MS-DOS in 1994. Sometimes described as a fantasy-themed spin-off of classic &quot;Civilization&quot; or sci-fi themed &quot;Master of Orion&quot;, it has proven to be quite enduring, becoming a cult classic in its niche of fantasy-themed 4X strategy games. While it never received a direct sequel, a number of other games published since have been described as inspired by it, and reviewers and players remain divided on whether any has succeeded at recapturing the feeling and gameplay of the original.

&quot;Master of Magic&quot;″s early versions had many bugs, and were heavily criticized by reviewers. The last official patch version 1.31, released in March 1995, fixed many of the bugs and implemented updates to the AI. The patched version was received more positively by reviewers. The game was re-released in 2010 with Windows support on GOG.com. Slitherine Ltd. now owns the IP from Atari and has added a DLC, as well as releasing the game on Steam.

==Gameplay==
A world is randomly generated every time the player starts a new game, with the player being able to adjust land size, magic strength, game difficulty and other features. The player can customize the skills, spell choices and appearance of their wizard, choosing one of 14 races for the starting city.

The gameplay starts with units exploring their surroundings, pushing back the strategic map&#x27;s fog of war. During exploration, the player defeats monsters that are guarding treasure, finds the best locations for new cities, discovers the Towers of Wizardry that link the game&#x27;s two planes of Arcanus and Myrror and locates the cities of enemy wizards.

Apart from the Player&#x27;s first city, cities are established by settlers, then upgraded by adding buildings, which in turn improves the economy, availability and strength of units, city&#x27;s growth rate, mana and economics. Cities produce food, gold and mana. Military units require at least food and often gold upkeep; spellcasters consume mana in combat. While the player is exploring and colonizing new territories, new magical spells are researched. Spells can be used during or outside of combat.

&quot;Master of Magic&quot; splits spells into six schools of magic: Life Magic, which heals and protects; its antithesis Death Magic, which drains life and creates undead; Chaos Magic, which warps targets and spews destructive energies; Nature Magic, which controls the weather and turns it against the enemy; Sorcery, which manipulates the air and subverts the effects of the other schools; and Arcane Magic, which is a general school and free for all. Players select spellbooks from desired schools, allowing them to research and cast spells from said schools. The number of spells a wizard can learn from each school is dependent on the number of books chosen for that school. The game&#x27;s five schools of magic have been inspired by the card game &quot;&quot;.

Additionally, the player can select traits in addition to spellbooks. Traits provide special bonuses throughout the game.

There are global spells that affect targets throughout the world. Unit or city enhancement spells can boost the potential of its target, such as increasing the movement and attack speed of units, enabling them to regenerate wounds and increasing the power of their attacks. Wizards can summon creatures related to their schools. The player can research combat spells, which include direct attacks, debuffs and traps. The final spell learned is the Arcane Spell of Mastery, which takes enormous resources to research and cast but instantly wins the game for the casting player.

A tactical battle begins when two armies occupy the same square on the global map. The battle takes place in an isometric map that expands the contested square in detail (including fortifications and terrain aspects that affect movement and combat). The two forces are arrayed at opposite edges of the map and the battle is conducted in a series of turns. One side achieves victory by eliminating the other or forcing it to flee the combat; a draw occurs if both sides remain after 50 turns.

The player can recruit 86 unit types from the cities to build their armies. A few (such as swordsmen and archers) are generic, while others (such as troll shamans) feature racial bonuses (such as regeneration or flight) that make them more valuable or more powerful than generic units. Most city-recruited units are unique to the city&#x27;s region or terrain and have special abilities like magic use, ranged attacks or an ability to always strike first in combat. Mercenaries can seek employment with famous wizards, allowing them to possibly recruit units which their cities are unable to produce. The player can even summon fantastic creatures, such as demon lords or enormous creatures like dragons. The variety of units with unique special abilities offer many options when building an army.

Many distinct heroes are available for players to hire or summon. Heroes have special abilities that boost the efficiency of other military units (like bestowing offensive or defensive bonuses) or allow the hero to perform special attacks, grant them immense strength or toughness, among other abilities.

==Plot and setting==
&quot;Master of Magic&quot; takes place across two worlds, Arcanus and Myrror. Arcanus is a land much like the Earth, with climatic zones and varied terrain like forests, oceans, grasslands and deserts. Myrror is a parallel world to Arcanus, featuring heavier magic use and fantastic flora, minerals and fauna not found on Arcanus. The two worlds are physically linked to each other by special portals called Towers of Wizardry, allowing units to travel between worlds.

Magic nodes—which are valuable sources of magical power—are scattered throughout both worlds. The worlds are populated by traditional fantasy races like elves and halflings, plus races which were introduced early to gaming via Simtex&#x27;s games, like the insectoid Klackons.

==Reception==
&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;beginner players may have some trouble with the game&#x27;s high level of complexity and often hard-to-follow instructions, but veterans will be satisfied&quot;.

&quot;Master of Magic&quot; was a nominee for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1994 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;X-COM: UFO Defense&quot;.

Early versions of &quot;Master of Magic&quot; were riddled with bugs and had a terrible artificial intelligence (AI), frustrating a lot of reviewers with its crashes and ignorant enemies. Despite that, it was announced as the Runner-up Strategy Game of the Year by &quot;Strategy Plus&quot; magazine, coming in behind its older sibling &quot;Master of Orion&quot;. A few patches later, version 1.2 corrected a lot of the bugs and added some tweaks, but there were still game-crashing moments. Bill Cranston of GameBytes also savaged other aspects of the game, constantly comparing it against the 1991 hit &quot;Civilization&quot;.

He said the gameplay was mostly repetitive clickings of the &quot;end turn&quot; button throughout several hundred eventless turns. Other complaints on his list also include &quot;Master of Magic&quot;″s magic not being as crucial to winning the game in a straightforward manner, as compared to &quot;Civilization&quot;″s technology. The potential of racial strife was less than fulfilled as military units of different races can co-exist harmoniously even though subjugated cities of a different race can rise up in rebellion. &quot;Coming Soon Magazine!&quot; however reviewed the same version and called it a must-have for strategy fans with great gameplay and many spells.

&quot;Master of Magic&quot; version 1.31 was released in March 1995. It rectified many more bugs and implemented a few changes to the AI. IGN reviewed this version of &quot;Master of Magic&quot; in 2002 and stated that the ability to customize the player&#x27;s character, random maps and vast variety of spells and creatures give an immense replayability to the game. The dual planes concept and intense tactical battles spiced with spells, encouraged them to name the latest version of the game as the best fantasy strategy game ever made.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called this version fantastic and named it as #141 of their &quot;150 Best Games of All Time&quot;. Similarly, IGN placed the game as one of their &quot;Top 25 Games of All Time&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; in 2003, praising it for its innovative simultaneous play of two worlds. Tracy Baker wrote in &quot;Computer Gaming Classics&quot; named it as a strategy game classic for its success in implementing the mechanics of &quot;Master of Orion&quot; in a fantasy setting.

&quot;Master of Magic&quot; was inducted into GameSpy&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2000, with the network describing it as a visually stunning game with &quot;enduring replayability&quot;, due to its randomness and large variety of spells. GameSpy credited the game with being more popular than &quot;Master of Orion&quot; and responsible for making Steve Barcia and Simtex household names. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; inducted &quot;Master of Magic&quot; into its Hall of Fame in 2005. The game has been referenced as a representative product of MicroProse in gaming reviews. The writer Alan Emrich, responsible for coining the &quot;4X genre&quot; term, has placed &quot;Master of Magic&quot; in the top position on his &quot;Games of All Time&quot; list in 2001.

In 2012, a retrospective review of Eurogamer concluded: &quot;It hasn&#x27;t yet been surpassed by any other fantasy 4X game. Curiously enough, &quot;Master of Magic&quot; remains the best example of its kind&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1997, the game was ported to PlayStation with various graphical improvements, retitled . This was a Japan-only release by Asmik (developed by Opera House).

After the closure of developer Simtex in 1997 and the end of official support the game&#x27;s community took up the support with community patches to fix remaining bugs and unbalances. As of 2020 there is patch v1.52 by the community available.

In 1997, MicroProse released a &quot;Master of Magic&quot; &quot;Jr.&quot; scenario, using the &quot;Civilization II&quot; engine, as part of the &quot;Civ II: Fantastic Worlds&quot; expansion for &quot;Civilization II&quot;. Steve Barcia stated that &quot;Master of Magic II&quot; would be complete by spring 1998, with new features, spells, monsters and a spell designer included, but Simtex was closed down later that year. MicroProse revealed that it would be developing the sequel on its own, but this plan was canceled when the company&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated in 2000. Despite the later emergence of games that resemble &quot;Master of Magic&quot; (such as the &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; series), reviewers like Kyle Ackerman and GameSpot editor Andrew Park have stated that the game&#x27;s essence has not yet been re-captured.

Due to &quot;Master of Magic&quot;&#x27;s impact on the fantasy &quot;turn-based strategy&quot; genre, the &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; series, which some considered almost identical in terms of gameplay, has received comparisons in reviews of the latter. However, Lennart Sas, the lead designer for &quot;Age of Wonders&quot;, argues against this. Other series that have been also compared to &quot;Master of Magic&quot;, including &quot;&quot; series from Illwinter Game Design.

Further prospects of a sequel surfaced with the announcement that companies Quicksilver Software and Stardock had obtained the rights to undertake such a venture. These companies were unable to reach an accord with Atari, who had negotiated complete control of marketing the property. &quot;Game Informer&quot; reported in 2007 that Stardock aimed to release a remake of &quot;Master of Magic&quot; in 2009. However, a Stardock employee, Aaron Rister, clarified in the company&#x27;s own forums that &quot;Game Informer&quot; was a mistaken reference to a 2010 game &quot;&quot;.

In April 2013, Wastelands Interactive launched a successful Kickstarter bid to fund the game &quot;Worlds of Magic&quot; which is meant as a spiritual successor to Master of Magic, and designer George Edward Purdy who worked on &quot;Master of Orion&quot; and &quot;Master of Magic&quot; joined the team. &quot;Worlds of Magic&quot; officially launched at retail outlets and on Steam according to the gaming news site, Gamasutra on March 19, 2015. Sometimes also known as Worlds of Magic: Planar Conquest, was released for a number other platforms over the next few years, to mixed reviews.

In February 2020, an expansion pack was released as downloadable content titled &quot;Master of Magic: Caster of Magic&quot;. It started development as a user-made mod.

A remake to &quot;Master of Magic&quot; by MuHa Games was announced in August 2019 and released under the same title in December 2022. It received generally positive reviews.

<text>The Haast River / Awarua is a river on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The Māori name for the river is Awarua. It drains the western watershed of the Haast Pass. The Haast River is in length, and enters the Tasman Sea near Haast township. The river&#x27;s main tributary is the Landsborough River.

==Toponomy==
Julius von Haast named the river after himself, &quot;directed, so he said, by his Provincial Superintendent&quot;. Von Haast explored a route from Otago to the West Coast that was long known to Māori; his four companions were William Young (a surveyor), Charles Håring (a retired sailor), William Francis Warner (later the proprietor of Warner&#x27;s Hotel), and Robert Langley Holmes (later the Canterbury provincial meteorologist). They set out on 22 January 1863 and stood in the surf on 20 February.

==Geography==

The river is set within the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage Site. The majority of the surrounding land is publicly owned and administered by the Department of Conservation. The grassy flats on the lower reaches are grazed by cattle owned by the local farmers. Tourism operators offer jetboat tours on the river.

 follows virtually the complete length of the river. From near Haast Pass, the state highway is located on the river&#x27;s true left. It switches to the true right at the Gates of Haast Bridge. At Pleasant Flat, where the valley widens out, the state highway crosses back to the true left. The final bridge is near the coast, just after the turnoff to the Haast township. At it is the longest one-lane road bridge in New Zealand, and the 7th longest New Zealand bridge overall.

===The Haast plain===

The Haast plain extends from Ship Creek to Jackson Bay / Okahu. The plain has an unusual landform, with long parallel lines of low hills with narrow swales in between. In some places, the plain is wide, with six rows of dunes and swales. The landform results from the combined effects of sediment carried to the coast by six large rivers, longshore drift and periodic seismic uplifts. The rivers discharging into the Tasman sea in this region of coastline drain from large catchment areas in the Southern Alps, where there is high rainfall and the mountains have high rates of erosion. The suspended sediment yield of the Arawhata River has been reported as 7.18 Mt/yr, and the Haast River as 5.93 Mt/yr. The total estimated suspended sediment yield from rivers in South Westland is over 50 Mt/yr. Longshore drift leads to much of this sediment being deposited along the Haast coastline, forming dunes. The Alpine Fault runs along the inland edge of the plain, and the entire area is subject to tectonic uplift during major seismic events. Following a major uplift, existing dunes are no longer exposed to the action of the sea, and new dunes begin to form. This creates a longitudinal pattern of dunes with low-lying wetlands in between. The coastal plain is approximately 6,000 years old. The dunes close to the current shoreline have little vegetation, but the older dunes further inland are forested with tall podocarps. The swales contain wetland lakes, pakihi and kahikitea swamp forests.

<text>Christopher Fehn (born February 24, 1973) is an American musician. He was a percussionist and backing vocalist for the heavy metal band Slipknot from 1998 to 2019, in which he was designated #3. He was also the bassist for Will Haven from 2010 to 2012.

==Career==

=== Slipknot ===

Fehn grew up in Ankeny, Iowa. Prior to joining Slipknot, he played as a kicker on the Wayne State University football team. Fehn joined the band around August (or September) 1998, replacing percussionist Brandon Darner.

As well as lending his percussion talents to the band, Fehn has also sung backing vocals on a number of songs Slipknot has both recorded and performed live. Fehn describes himself as a &quot;big fan of the band&quot; and says of Slipknot, &quot;the world needed something like this.&quot;

In an interview with Face Culture, Fehn stated that the band members gave him a hard time during his early years with the band. He described that his time during the self-titled album era was his &quot;hazing period.&quot;

Slipknot bassist Paul Gray stated in an interview that Fehn &quot;often brings humor to the band,&quot; and that they &quot;definitely need that guy.&quot; Fehn would wear a Pinocchio-style mask and would frequently stroke the nose as if he was masturbating. Prior to joining Slipknot in 1998, Fehn was close friends with Slipknot&#x27;s percussionist Shawn Crahan. According to Fehn, he had originally asked Crahan if he could be drummer Joey Jordison&#x27;s drum tech. Shortly after his request was made, Fehn was given an offer to play percussion in the band. Fehn was then given a rough demo that contained all of Slipknot&#x27;s songs. Fehn has said that &quot;Spit It Out&quot; was the song that stood out to him the most. Fehn then tried out on percussion and was subsequently made part of Slipknot. Of the nine members, Fehn was the eighth to join the band.

His mask was featured in the movie &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot;.

He was in the band Will Haven as bassist from 2010 to 2012.

On March 14, 2019, Fehn filed a lawsuit against Slipknot, citing payment being held back. Fehn specifically accused Corey Taylor and Shawn Crahan for what he felt was questionable business dealings.

On March 18, 2019, Fehn officially split with Slipknot following the filing of his lawsuit. However, a few days later, the message was removed from the website and according to Fehn&#x27;s lawyer, the percussionist&#x27;s employment status with the band had not changed since his initial filing.

==Personal life==
In the early years of Slipknot before their signing with Roadrunner Records, Fehn was an electrician.

Fehn has two sons, born in 2012, and 2023.

<doc id="644017" wikidata="Q2715339" url="?curid=644017" title="Raspberries (band)">
<text>The Raspberries were an American pop rock band formed in 1970 from Cleveland, Ohio. They had a run of success in the early 1970s music scene with their pop rock sound, which AllMusic later described as featuring &quot;exquisitely crafted melodies and achingly gorgeous harmonies.&quot; The members were known for their clean-cut public image and matching suits, which brought them teenybopper attention as well as scorn from some mainstream media outlets as &quot;uncool&quot;. The group drew influence from the British Invasion era—especially the Beatles, the Who, the Hollies, and the Small Faces—and its mod sensibility. In both the US and the UK, the Raspberries helped pioneer the power pop music style that took off after the group disbanded. They also have had a following among professional musicians such as Jack Bruce, Ringo Starr, and Courtney Love.

The group&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; lineup consisted of Eric Carmen (vocals, guitars, bass, piano), Wally Bryson (guitars), Dave Smalley (guitars, bass) and Jim Bonfanti (drums). Their best known songs include &quot;Go All the Way&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Overnight Sensation (Hit Record)&quot;. Producer Jimmy Ienner was responsible for all four of the Raspberries&#x27; albums in the 1970s. The group disbanded in 1975 after a five-year run, and Eric Carmen proceeded to a successful career as a solo artist. Bryson and Smalley resurrected the group&#x27;s name in 1999 for an album, which included singer/songwriter Scott McCarl as vocalist. In 2004, the original quartet reunited and undertook a well-received reunion tour in 2005.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The group had its roots in two of Cleveland&#x27;s most successful local bands in the late 1960s, The Choir and Cyrus Erie. The Choir, originally called The Mods and consisting of Dann Klawon, Wally Bryson, Dave Burke, Dave Smalley, and Jim Bonfanti, had a more extensive repertoire of original songs. Most notable was &quot;It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; which parlayed its massive local success (#1 in Cleveland) into a nationally charting single (peaking at No. 68 for Roulette Records). The Choir then went through a series of lineup changes, with Smalley and Bonfanti remaining in the various versions, until 1968, when Dave Smalley was drafted and sent to Vietnam. As a result, The Choir disbanded, although it later reformed behind Bonfanti and ultimately survived until 1970.

Although The Choir had the hit and a string of singles, Cyrus Erie, founded by brothers Michael and Bob McBride, became the better-drawing local act shortly after Eric Carmen joined in 1967. Carmen persuaded Bryson, who had recently left The Choir, to join. In live shows, Cyrus Erie mainly covered other artists&#x27; songs. When the group signed to Epic Records they recorded two Carmen/Bryson originals (&quot;Get the Message&quot; b/w &quot;Sparrow&quot;) as a single. Following this, Bryson left, and was replaced by Randy Klawon. Eric, Mike, Randy and Dann Klawon then formed a new act, and the name was changed to The Quick. The Quick recorded a single of two Carmen/Klawon originals for Epic which did not find much success.

The group&#x27;s style arose from a variety of rock and roll groups that the members loved, especially The Who. Carmen later said:
=== 1970–1972 ===
After discussions between Carmen and Bonfanti about forming a new group, the first lineup for the Raspberries was Eric Carmen (rhythm guitar, vocals, piano, bass), Jim Bonfanti (drums, backing vocals), Wally Bryson (lead guitar, vocals) and John Aleksic (born 1951, bass, guitar, vocals). Aleksic left the group at the end of 1970 and the group performed as a trio until April 1971, when former Choir member Dave Smalley (rhythm guitar, vocals), just back from Vietnam, became the fourth member of the original recording lineup with Carmen moving to bass. The Raspberries&#x27; demo tape went to the desk of producer Jimmy Ienner, for whom Carmen had previously done session work. After a major-label bidding war the band signed to Capitol Records. This 1st album featured a strong scratch and sniff raspberry scented sticker on the front cover.

The Raspberries wore matching ensembles on stage, and the group was criticized for making its stage entrance in tuxedos and large bouffant hairdos which, according to Carmen, &quot;complemented the style of our music&quot;.

=== 1972–1974 ===
&quot;Go All the Way&quot; peaked at #5 in the U.S. in October 1972, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Afterwards, Carmen and Smalley switched instruments, with Carmen moving to rhythm guitar so that he would be upfront on stage, while Smalley took over bass. After two albums, &quot;Raspberries&quot; and &quot;Fresh&quot;, both released in 1972, creative tension came to a head sparked largely by Carmen&#x27;s creative dominance (and commercial success) over the contributions of Bryson and Smalley. Accordingly, &quot;Side 3&quot; turned out to be a more raw, aggressive effort than its predecessors, typified by the opening track &quot;Tonight&quot;. After the band&#x27;s tour for &quot;Side 3&quot;, Smalley was ejected from the band due to musical differences and Bonfanti departed soon afterwards. They subsequently formed their own band, Dynamite. They were replaced in December 1973 by bassist Scott McCarl and ex-Cyrus Erie drummer Michael McBride for what was to be the fourth and final Raspberries album, &quot;Starting Over&quot;.

Bryson&#x27;s friend Jeff Hutton (who had also played with McBride in Target) was brought in to contribute keyboards on stage for the group&#x27;s late 1973-74 tours, replacing Opie O&#x27;Brien (keyboards, sax) and Tony Shannon (keyboards, synths) who had done the honors on their 1973 tour for &quot;Side 3&quot;.

=== Post-breakup ===
In April 1975 Rainbow Canyon guitarist Billy Hanna came in to sub for an ill Bryson, but the band broke up on April 19, 1975 after a final gig in Scranton, Pennsylvania at the Masonic Temple.

Their style, however, continued to influence other musicians. Bruce Springsteen praised the Raspberries at several stops during his Summer 2005 tour. Springsteen&#x27;s drummer Max Weinberg said that he based his drum style in that period off of Raspberries drummer Michael McBride (particularly on the Springsteen album &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;). Paul Stanley of Kiss, Tom Petty, and Axl Rose of Guns N&#x27; Roses, have all also cited the Raspberries as an influence in their songwriting.

In 1978 Bryson joined another notable power pop band, Fotomaker, led by ex-Rascals Dino Danelli and Gene Cornish. He left shortly after the second of the band&#x27;s three albums was released.

A biography of the Raspberries titled &quot;Overnight Sensation – The Story of the Raspberries&quot; by Ken Sharp was released in 1993.

In 1996, a tribute album to Raspberries called &quot;Raspberries Preserved&quot; was released by Pravda Records, a Chicago-based indie record label. The album featured 21 cover versions by such acts as The Rubinoos, Bill Lloyd, Brad Jones, Tiny Lights, Rank Strangers, the Gladhands, and The Shambles.

Singer-guitarist and primary songwriter Eric Carmen went on to have a successful solo career as a singer and writer of romantic pop ballads. His first solo hit &quot;All by Myself&quot; (which rearranged a motif from the melody of &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot; and comes directly from Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Opus 18) hit No. 2 nationally, and was covered by Celine Dion to much fanfare in 1996. His second single &quot;Never Gonna Fall in Love Again&quot; was also a hit, as was &quot;She Did It”, a spiritual sequel to both, which revived the Raspberries&#x27; power pop sound. The chorus of &quot;Never Gonna Fall in Love Again&quot; came from Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Symphony No.2 Op.27. Carmen later had additional Top Ten singles success with &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot; (from &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, 1987) and &quot;Make Me Lose Control&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Almost Paradise&quot; (performed by Mike Reno and Ann Wilson for &quot;Footloose&quot;, 1984), as well as songs that were made major hits by Shaun Cassidy (&quot;That&#x27;s Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and &quot;Hey Deanie&quot;).

On March 24, 1999 all four original members, Carmen, Bryson, Smalley and Bonfanti, reunited in Metrosync Studio, near Cleveland, to play for the first time since 1973. A summer reunion tour was discussed, but the reformed group found minimal interest among promoters since the band had not been heard of since the mid-70s. Carmen and Bonfanti dropped out but Bryson, Smalley and their &quot;Starting Over&quot; bassist, Scott McCarl, decided to continue on briefly. The trio released a six-song EP entitled &quot;Raspberries Refreshed&quot; in September 2000. The album&#x27;s tracks, written by the three remaining members, re-created the group&#x27;s original sound.

In November 2004 the House of Blues nightclub chain opened its Cleveland branch with a Raspberries reunion concert featuring all four original members, accompanied on stage by four members of Carmen&#x27;s band: Paul Sidoti - bass, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, Billy Sullivan - guitar, keyboards, harmonica, backing vocals, Jennifer Lee - keyboards, vocals and Derek Braunschweiger - percussion. This led to a well-received 2005 mini-tour starting at the Chicago House of Blues, a VH1 Classic special, and a concert broadcast on XM Satellite Radio. A date from the 2005 tour in Los Angeles was recorded and released in 2007 as &quot;Live on Sunset Strip.&quot; The double CD and one DVD contained a foreword from Bruce Springsteen, and a 1970s photo of John Lennon wearing a Raspberries&#x27; &quot;Starting Over&quot; sweatshirt. Capitalizing on the release, Raspberries played further shows in New York, California, and their hometown of Cleveland.

The band booked a few more reunion dates into late 2007, culminating with a concert at Cleveland&#x27;s Playhouse Square on December 14, 2007, and an appearance at a VIP event at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland on April 3, 2009 turned out to be their very last show.

The band&#x27;s iconic rock tune &quot;Go All the Way&quot; attracted renewed attention in 2014 when it was notably included in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. &quot;The Albany Democrat-Herald&quot; ran a positive review of the film remarking that &quot;while it&#x27;s freaky to hear the Raspberries&#x27; ... in space, one recognizes the malleability of its majesty and craft and appreciate the range of vocalist Eric Carmen&quot;. The song was included on the film&#x27;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1&quot; soundtrack released on July 29, 2014.

In 2017 Omnivore Records released &quot;Pop Art Live&quot;, a recording of the band&#x27;s first Cleveland reunion show on November 26, 2004. It was their first show together in nearly 30 years. Featuring twenty-eight songs, including material by major influences The Beatles and The Who, the album received positive reviews from publications such as &quot;Allmusic&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot;, and &quot;Stereophile&quot;. Critic Mark Deming of Allmusic remarked that &quot;the Raspberries merge the superb craftsmanship of their classic recordings with the sweat and muscle of a crack band having a great time.&quot;

Carmen died in March 2024.
