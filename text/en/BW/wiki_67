<text>The Kleine Scheidegg () is a mountain pass at an elevation of , situated below and between the Eiger and Lauberhorn peaks in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. The name means &quot;minor watershed&quot;, as it only divides the two arms of the Lütschine river, both converging at Zweilütschinen, while the nearby Grosse Scheidegg divides the Lütschine from the Rychenbach stream.

The pass is traversed by a walking trail and the Wengernalp Railway, which both connect the villages of Grindelwald with Lauterbrunnen, passing through Wengen between the pass summit and Lauterbrunnen. In winter, Kleine Scheidegg is the centre of the ski area around Grindelwald and Wengen. In summer, it is a popular hiking destination, and is one of the passes crossed by the Alpine Pass Route between Sargans and Montreux. The Jungfrau Marathon, a mountain race that takes place every year in early September, ends at Kleine Scheidegg.
The Kleine Scheidegg railway station is sited at the summit of the pass. Besides being an intermediate stop on the Wengernalp Railway, the station is also the lower terminus of the Jungfrau Railway, which climbs steeply through tunnels inside the Eiger and Mönch mountains up to its terminal at the Jungfraujoch, the highest point reachable by rail in Europe. Both railways operate year-round, and any passengers travelling to the Jungfraujoch must change trains at Kleine Scheidegg. The pass is linked to the summit of the Lauberhorn and to Arvengarten, on the approach to the pass from Grindelwald, by chairlifts.

There are also several restaurants and hotels at the summit of the pass, including the historic &quot;Hotel Bellevue des Alpes&quot; that dates back to 1840.

== History ==

Prior to the coming of the railways and the introduction of tourism to the area, the twin passes of Kleine Scheidegg and Grosse Scheidegg provided access for local livestock and dairy farmers to the important export route to Italy over the Grimsel Pass. With the coming of tourism and the opening of the first mountain hotels in the 1830s, the transit of the Kleine Scheidegg became busier, and more important than the Grosse Scheidegg.

In 1840, Christian Seiler built the inn &quot;Zur Gemse&quot; on the summit of the pass. Guests and supplies reached the inn by mule train over the pass tracks, and the inn grew into the internationally famous &quot;Hotel Bellevue&quot;. The Wengernalp co-operative opened the competing &quot;Hotel des Alps&quot; alongside the &quot;Hotel Bellevue&quot;, but sold out to the Seiler family, thus creating the merged &quot;Hotel Bellevue des Alps&quot;.
In order to satisfy tourist demand, construction of the Wengernalp Railway across the pass commenced in 1891, and the line opened in 1893, as a steam hauled summer only service. The line was electrified in 1909/10, and year-round operation started in 1925 (to Lauterbrunnen) and 1960 (to Grindelwald). Construction of the Jungfrau Railway started in 1896, and it opened in stages from 1898 to 1912. Since the 1930s, Kleine Scheidegg has been the base of expeditions on the north face of the Eiger.

== Geography ==
Kleine Scheidegg is among the most celebrated mountain passes in the Swiss Alps because of its position just north of the point where the Bernese Alps makes a salient angle, whose apex is the Eiger. From there, a series of high peaks rise in line towards the northeast, on the left side of the trail that follows a direct route from Meiringen, southwest across the Grosse Scheidegg, to Kleine Scheidegg. On the south side of the apex at the Eiger, the still higher summits of the Mönch, Jungfrau, Gletscherhorn, and Mittaghorn follow in succession from north to south.

Hidden by the Eiger from the vantage point of Grindelwald, the Mönch and Jungfrau break upon the traveller at Kleine Scheidegg in full grandeur, rising from the narrow gorge of the Trümmletental. Three comparatively large glaciers, with several minor accumulations of ice, are found in the hollows and on the shelving ledges of the three peaks that rise above the Trümmletental. The Eiger Glacier lies in the recess between the Eiger and the Mönch. This is separated by a huge projecting buttress of the latter mountain from the Guggi Glacier. Farther on is the Giessen Glacier, formed, at a higher level than the two last, on a shelf of the northwest side of the Jungfrau.

Politically, the pass at Kleine Scheidegg marks the boundary between the municipalities of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, both of which are within the canton of Bern.

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;Kleine Scheidegg&quot; (1937) was set on the eponymous pass, directed by Richard Schweizer, and starring Susanne Baader, Leopold Biberti and Emil Hegetschweiler.

In the summer of 1974, Clint Eastwood and his cast and crew stayed at the &quot;Hotel Bellevue des Alpes&quot; at Kleine Scheidegg while filming &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; (1975). Several scenes were filmed in and around the hotel.

The 2008 film &quot;North Face&quot;, about Toni Kurz and Andreas Hinterstoisser&#x27;s 1936 attempt to climb the Eiger north face, was shot to a great extent at the &quot;Hotel Bellevue des Alpes&quot;. Footage of the mountain&#x27;s profile was also shot from Kleine Scheidegg&#x27;s vantage point, though the climbing scenes were created mostly using computer generated imagery and green screen technology.

The hiking track in the area is the basis for the fictional Eiger Nordwand tracks in the racing video games &quot;Gran Turismo HD Concept&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 5 Prologue&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 5, and &quot;Gran Turismo 6.&quot;

<doc id="650552" wikidata="Q6084272" url="?curid=650552" title="William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh">
<text>William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh (died 9 August 1613) was an English nobleman, politician, peer, and knight. He was Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1594 to 1597.

He was the fourth and younger son of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford and his first wife Margaret (). His birthdate is uncertain, with some records showing that he was born as early as 1553, some as late as 1563. 

He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, but apparently did not graduate. He spent several years in travelling through France, Germany, Italy, and Hungary. Returning to England about 1579, he was sent to Ireland in October 1580 in command of a company of recruits raised by the English clergy for the wars in Ireland. He was stationed on the Wicklow frontier to hold Fiach MacHugh O&#x27;Byrne in check, and on 4 April 1581 he and William Stanley succeeded in burning Fiagh&#x27;s house of Ballinacor and killing some of his followers. He was rewarded with a lease of the abbey of Baltinglass Abbey in Co. Carlow on 4 September, and, being licensed to return to England, he was knighted by the lord-deputy, Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton, on 10 September. On the occasion of the Duc d&#x27;Alençon&#x27;s visit to England in November, he took part in a royal combat and fight on foot, wherein the duke and the prince dauphin were the challengers and Russell and Lord Thomas Howard the defenders.

Russell began his active military career in the Netherlands in 1585, being made lieutenant-general of cavalry. In September 1586 he distinguished himself at the Battle of Zutphen and was noted for maintaining an effective fighting force in difficult circumstances. He was appointed Governor of Flushing in 1587, but was recalled on his own initiative the following year. On 16 May 1594 he was appointed to the office of Lord Deputy of Ireland, where he served with flamboyance.

At the time, Ireland was on the point of rebellion, and there were two opinions in government on how to preserve the peace. One faction sought negotiation with the Irish rebels, while the other – including Russell – favoured military force. Russell&#x27;s faction prevailed, and the rebellion grew into a general revolt, which lasted through the Nine Years War and ended with the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603. In August 1594 Russell relieved the garrison of the northern town of Enniskillen, which had been under siege for several months, but failed to capture the Irish leaders.

During his time in Ireland, Russell fell into dispute with his chief military commander, Sir John Norris. The dispute proved harmful to the crown government, and Russell was recalled to England in 1597, but only after he had captured and killed the rebel Fiach MacHugh O&#x27;Byrne.

In 1599, Russell was named as leader of the forces defending western England in anticipation of a Spanish invasion. However, the invasion plans were thwarted.

Russell built the mansion of Woburn. In the 1590s, he consulted with three Dutchmen as to the potential for draining his manor of Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire; his son, Francis Russell, continued the family interest in drainage and led the undertakers in the first attempt to drain the Great Level of the Fens, later known as the Bedford Level.
Russell was created Baron Russell of Thornhaugh in 1603, but he lost influence at court and retired to his estates, where he died on 9 August 1613. His tomb is in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Thornhaugh.

Russell married on 13 February 1585 at Watford, Elizabeth Long, only daughter and sole heiress of Henry Long of Shingay, Cambridgeshire, and granddaughter of Sir Richard Long. They had one son, Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford. The church registers of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Watford record that the child was baptised in 1587.

<doc id="650560" wikidata="Q746646" url="?curid=650560" title="Dido and Aeneas">
<text>Dido and Aeneas (Z. 626) is an opera in a prologue and three acts, written by the English Baroque composer Henry Purcell with a libretto by Nahum Tate. The dates of the composition and first performance of the opera are uncertain. It was composed no later than July 1688, and had been performed at Josias Priest&#x27;s girls&#x27; school in London by the end of 1689. Some scholars argue for a date of composition as early as 1683. The story is based on Book IV of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. It recounts the love of Dido, Queen of Carthage, for the Trojan hero Aeneas, and her despair when he abandons her. A monumental work in Baroque opera, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; is remembered as one of Purcell&#x27;s foremost theatrical works. It was also Purcell&#x27;s only true opera, as well as his only all-sung dramatic work. One of the earliest known English operas, it owes much to John Blow&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, both in structure and in overall effect.

The influence of Cavalli&#x27;s opera &quot;Didone&quot; is also apparent. Both works use the prologue/three acts format and there are similarities between, for instance, Mercury&#x27;s solo in &quot;Didone&quot; and the solo &quot;Come away fellow sailors&quot; in Purcell&#x27;s work.

==Background and context==

Before &quot;Dido and Aeneas,&quot; Purcell had composed music for several stage works, including nine pieces for Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s &quot;Theodosius, or The Force of Love&quot; (1680) and eight songs for Thomas d&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s &quot;A Fool&#x27;s Preferment&quot; (1688). He also composed songs for two plays by Nahum Tate (later the librettist of Dido and Aeneas), &quot;The Sicilian Usurper&quot; (1680) and &quot;Cuckold&#x27;s Haven&quot; (1685). &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; was Purcell&#x27;s first (and only) all-sung opera and derives from the English masque tradition.

===Libretto===
Originally based on Nahum Tate&#x27;s play &quot;Brutus of Alba, or The Enchanted Lovers&quot; (1678), the opera is likely, at least to some extent, to be allegorical. The prologue refers to the joy of a marriage between two monarchs, which could refer to the marriage between William and Mary. In a poem of about 1686, Tate alluded to James II as Aeneas, who is misled by the evil machinations of the Sorceress and her witches (representing Roman Catholicism, a common metaphor at the time) into abandoning Dido, who symbolises the British people. The same symbolism may apply to the opera. This explains the addition of the characters of the Sorceress and the witches, which do not appear in the original &quot;Aeneid&quot;. It would be noble, or at least acceptable, for Aeneas to follow the decree of the gods, but not so acceptable for him to be tricked by ill-meaning spirits.

Although the opera is a tragedy, there are numerous seemingly lighter scenes, such as the First Sailor&#x27;s song, &quot;Take a boozy short leave of your nymphs on the shore, and silence their mourning with vows of returning, though never intending to visit them more.&quot; Musicologist Ellen T. Harris considers the callousness and cynicism of the song to underline the &quot;moral&quot; of the story, that young women should not succumb to the advances and promises of ardent young men.

===Score===
No score in Purcell&#x27;s hand is extant, and the only seventeenth-century source is a libretto, possibly from the original performance. The earliest extant score, held in the Bodleian Library, was copied no earlier than 1750, well over sixty years after the opera was composed. No later sources follow the act divisions of the libretto, and the music to the prologue is lost. The prologue, the end of the act 2 &#x27;Grove&#x27; scene, and several dances, were almost certainly lost when the opera was divided into parts to be performed as interludes between the acts of spoken plays in the first decade of the eighteenth century.

The first of the arias to be published separately was &quot;Ah, Belinda&quot; in &quot;Orpheus Britannicus&quot;. The most famous aria of the work is &quot;When I am laid in earth&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot;. Both arias are formed on a lamento ground bass. &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot; has been performed or recorded by artists far from the typical operatic school, such as Klaus Nomi (as &quot;Death&quot;), Ane Brun and Jeff Buckley. It has also been transcribed or used in many scores, including the soundtrack to the HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (renamed &quot;Nixon&#x27;s Walk&quot;). It is played annually by a military band at the Cenotaph remembrance ceremony, which takes place on the Sunday nearest to 11 November (Armistice Day) in London&#x27;s Whitehall. The music is sometimes thought to be too simple for Purcell in 1689, but this may simply reflect that the intended performers were schoolchildren. The work is scored for four-part strings and continuo. The fact that the libretto from the Chelsea School performance indicates two dances for guitar, the &quot;Dance Gittars Chacony&quot; in act 1, and the &quot;Gittar Ground a Dance&quot; in the &#x27;Grove&#x27; scene of act 2, has led one scholar to suggest that Purcell envisaged a guitar as a primary member of the continuo group for the opera. Music for neither of these dances is extant, and it seems likely that Purcell did not compose them, but rather left them to be improvised by the guitarist. Several editions of the opera have been made and have been provided with a continuo realisation; a notable, if rather idiosyncratic edition being that made by Imogen Holst and Benjamin Britten. There are a number of editions with realisations, and the opera&#x27;s accessibility to amateur performers is a feature that has greatly abetted the growth of its popularity in the latter half of the twentieth century. While the Prologue&#x27;s music has been lost and has not been reconstructed, several realisations of the opera include a solution to the missing &quot;ritornello&quot; at the end of the second act. Known to have been part of the score, it is now performed as a dance taken from other, similar works by Purcell, or invented outright in the same vein, to keep the integrity and continuity of the performance.

==Performance history==

===Premiere and early revivals===
A letter from the Levant merchant Rowland Sherman associates &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; with Josias Priest&#x27;s girls&#x27; school in Chelsea, London no later than the summer of 1688. The first performance may have taken place as early as 1 December 1687, and evidence suggests that the opera was performed at the school again in 1689. Several scholars have argued that the work was composed for the English court, either for Charles II (and perhaps as early as 1684) or for James II. Following the Chelsea performances, the opera was not staged again in Purcell&#x27;s lifetime. Its next performance was in 1700 as a &quot;masque&quot; incorporated into &quot;Beauty the Best Advocate&quot;, an adapted version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; at Thomas Betterton&#x27;s theatre in London.

After 1705 it disappeared as a staged work, with only sporadic concert performances, until 1895 when the first staged version in modern times was performed by students of the Royal College of Music at London&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre to mark the bicentenary of Purcell&#x27;s death. &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; received its first performance outside England on 14 December 1895 in a concert version at the University Society in Dublin.

===20th- and 21st-century performances===

&quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; premiered in the United States at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on 10 February 1923 performed by the girls of the Rosemary School, although &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;considerable liberties&quot; had been taken with the score. A concert version with professional musicians organised by the Society of Friends of Music took place on 13 January 1924 at the New York City Town Hall, using a score edited by Artur Bodanzky, who also conducted the performance.

As new critical editions of the score appeared, and with the revival of interest in Baroque music, the number of productions steadily increased. After Jonathan Miller&#x27;s visit to Bornholm, Denmark, &quot;Dido&quot; was performed in 2007 at the Rønne Theatre, which had been built in 1823. Kevin Duggan conducted. Amongst the new productions of the opera in 2009, the 350th anniversary of Purcell&#x27;s birth, were those staged by the De Nederlandse Opera, the Royal Opera, London, the Divertimento Baroque Opera Company, and Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, New York. The Royal Opera production, which featured contemporary dance by Wayne McGregor Random Dance and animated effects by Mark Hatchard, formed part of a double bill with Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;. In 2011 the opera was revived by City Wall Productions and set during World War II. A new Opera North production of the opera opened at Leeds Grand Theatre in February 2013. Opera Up Close performed a truncated version in 2011, setting it in an American high school in the 1950s.

===Adaptations===
A version of the opera adapted to modern dance was choreographed by the American Mark Morris, who originally danced both the roles of Dido and the Sorceress. It premiered on 11 March 1989 at the Théâtre Varia in Brussels. It has since been performed many times and was filmed in 1995 by Canadian director Barbara Willis Sweete, with Morris in the roles of Dido and the Sorceress. The production was subsequently seen at the Grand Théâtre in Luxembourg, Opéra national de Montpellier, and Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in London. In the Morris adaptation, as well as another by Sasha Waltz, the characters are each portrayed by both a singer and a dancer, with the dancers on stage and the singers performing from the side of the stage or the orchestra pit.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
&quot;Dido&#x27;s court&quot;

The opera opens with Dido in her court with her attendants. Belinda is trying to cheer Dido up, but Dido is full of sorrow, saying &#x27;Peace and I are strangers grown&#x27;. Belinda believes the source of this grief to be the Trojan Aeneas, and suggests that Carthage&#x27;s troubles could be resolved by a marriage between the two. Dido and Belinda talk for a time: Dido fears that her love will make her a weak monarch, but Belinda and the Second Woman reassure her that &quot;The hero loves as well.&quot; Aeneas enters the court, and is at first received coldly by Dido, but she eventually accepts his proposal of marriage.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: The cave of the Sorceress&quot;

The Sorceress/Sorcerer is plotting the destruction of Carthage and its queen, and summons companions to help with evil plans. The plan is to send her &quot;trusted elf&quot; disguised as Mercury, someone to whom Aeneas will surely listen, to tempt him to leave Dido and sail to Italy. This would leave Dido heartbroken, and she would surely die. The chorus join in with terrible laughter, and the Enchantresses decide to conjure up a storm to make Dido and her train leave the grove and return to the palace. When the spell is prepared, the witches vanish in a thunderclap.

&quot;Scene 2: A grove during the middle of a hunt&quot;

Dido and Aeneas are accompanied by their train. They stop at the grove to take in its beauty. A lot of action is taking place, with attendants carrying goods from the hunt and possibly a picnic in progress, Dido and Aeneas forming the focus of all the activity. This ceases when Dido hears distant thunder, prompting Belinda to tell the servants to prepare for a return to shelter as soon as possible. As every other character leaves the stage, Aeneas is stopped by the Sorceress&#x27;s elf, who is disguised as Mercury. This pretend Mercury brings the &quot;command of Jove&quot; that Aeneas is to wait no longer in beginning his task of creating a new Troy on Latin soil. Aeneas consents to the wishes of what he believes are the gods, but is heart-broken that he will have to leave Dido. He then goes off-stage to prepare for his departure from Carthage.

===Act 3===
&quot;The harbour at Carthage&quot;

Preparations are being made for the departure of the Trojan fleet. The sailors sing a song, which is followed shortly by the Sorceress and her companions&#x27; sudden appearance. The group is pleased at how well their plan has worked, and the Sorceress sings a solo describing her further plans for the destruction of Aeneas &quot;on the ocean&quot;. All the characters begin to clear the stage after a dance in three sections, and then disperse.

&quot;The palace&quot;

Dido and Belinda enter, shocked at Aeneas&#x27; disappearance. Dido is distraught and Belinda comforts her. Suddenly Aeneas returns, but Dido is full of fear before Aeneas speaks, and his words only serve to confirm her suspicions. She derides his reasons for leaving, and even when Aeneas says he will defy the gods and not leave Carthage, Dido rejects him for having once thought of leaving her. After Dido forces Aeneas to leave, she states that &quot;Death must come when he is gone.&quot; The opera and Dido&#x27;s life both slowly come to a conclusion, as the Queen of Carthage sings her last aria, &quot;When I am laid in Earth&quot;, also known as &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament.&quot; The chorus and orchestra then conclude the opera once Dido is dead by ordering the &quot;cupids to scatter roses on her tomb, soft and gentle as her heart. Keep here your watch, and never, never part.&quot;

==Recordings==
The first complete recording of the opera was made by Decca Records in 1935 with Nancy Evans as Dido and Roy Henderson as Aeneas, followed in 1945 by a His Master&#x27;s Voice release with Joan Hammond and Dennis Noble. Kirsten Flagstad, who had sung the role at the Mermaid Theatre in London, recorded it in 1951 for EMI with Thomas Hemsley as Aeneas. &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; has been recorded many times since the 1960s with Dido sung by mezzo-sopranos such as Janet Baker (1961), Tatiana Troyanos (1968), Teresa Berganza (1986), Anne Sofie von Otter (1989) and Susan Graham (2003). In addition to Joan Hammond and Kirsten Flagstad, sopranos who have recorded the role include Victoria de los Ángeles (1965), Emma Kirkby (1981), Jessye Norman (1986), Catherine Bott (1992), Lynne Dawson (1998), and Evelyn Tubb (2004).

Beginning with two pioneering recordings of the work with original instruments: Joel Cohen&#x27;s 1979 recording with the Boston Camerata, on Harmonia Mundi, and Andrew Parrott&#x27;s 1981 recording for Chandos with the Taverner Consort and Players, there was an increasing preference for a more genuine period sound. Further recordings by conductors and ensembles using this approach include those by Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music, William Christie and Les Arts Florissants (1986); Trevor Pinnock and The English Concert (1989); René Jacobs and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (1998); Emmanuelle Haïm and Le Concert d&#x27;Astrée (2003); and Predrag Gosta and New Trinity Baroque (2004). The Haïm recording with Susan Graham as Dido and Ian Bostridge as Aeneas was nominated for the Best Opera Recording in the 2005 Grammy Awards. Another notable recording dates from 1994, with The Scholars Baroque Ensemble and Kym Amps as Dido.

Several performances of the opera have been filmed and are available on DVD, most recently the 2008 performance at the Opéra-Comique in Paris conducted by William Christie and directed by Deborah Warner (FRA Musica FRA001) and the 2009 performance at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House conducted by Christopher Hogwood and directed by Wayne McGregor (OpusArte OA1018D). The Mark Morris dance version of the opera is also preserved on DVD (recorded 1995, Image Entertainment 8741) as is the dance version by Sasha Waltz (recorded 2005, Arthaus Musik 101311). Leopold Stokowski made a string orchestra arrangement of &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot;. Others who have recorded it include Matthias Bamert, José Serebrier, Richard Egarr and Iona Brown.

<doc id="650562" wikidata="Q2943094" url="?curid=650562" title="Cauim">
<text>Cauim is a traditional alcoholic beverage or beer of the indigenous peoples in Brazil since pre-Columbian times. It is still made today in remote areas throughout Panama and South America. Cauim is made by fermenting manioc (a large starchy root), or maize, sometimes flavored with fruit juices. The Kuna Indians of Panama use plantains.

In Spanish it is called or in some places (like Peru) . The best term in English may be &quot;Manioc beer&quot;. In Kichwa, . In Shuar, . In Paicoca, .

A characteristic feature of the beverage is that the starting material is cooked, chewed, and fermented, so that enzymes (including amylase) present in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars. (This principle was originally used also for Japanese sake.) 

==Preparation and customs==

===Historical use among the Tupinambá===
The following description, largely from Jean de Léry&#x27;s account of his trip to Brazil in the 16th century applies specifically to the Tupinambá natives who lived along the coast of central Brazil. However, it is typical of other tribes throughout Brazil.

Cauim preparation (like other cooking tasks) is strictly a women&#x27;s job, with no involvement from the men. Manioc roots are sliced thin, boiled until tender, and allowed to cool down. Then women and girls gather around the pot; each repeatedly takes a mouthful of manioc, chews it, and puts it into a second pot (depending on the culture). Enzymes in the saliva then convert the starch into fermentable sugars. (Men firmly believe that if they were to chew the paste, the resulting beverage would not taste as good; and anyway they consider that work as inappropriate for them as spinning yarn would be for European men.) The chewed root paste is put back on the fire and stirred with a wooden spoon until completely cooked. The paste is then allowed to ferment in large earthenware pots (&quot;half as big as a Burgundy wine barrel&quot;).

The resulting beverage is opaque and dense like wine dregs and tastes like sour milk. There are light and dark varieties of cauim, and the beverage can be flavored with various fruits.

The same process is used to make a similar beverage from maize. Since both plants grow abundantly throughout the year, the natives prepare the beverage in any season, sometimes in large quantities. Cauim can be consumed quietly by one or two people, but is most commonly consumed at parties with tens or hundreds of people, often from two or more villages. According to contemporary records, thirty or more large pots of cauim could be consumed in a single party; and &quot;neither the German, nor the Flemish, nor the soldiers, nor the Swiss — that is, none of those people in France who devote themselves to great drinking, will match the Americans in that art.&quot; Cauim was also &quot;de rigueur&quot; in solemn occasions, such as the ceremonial killing and eating of a war prisoner.

Serving the cauim at parties is also a women&#x27;s task. Cauim is better consumed warm, and so the women will place the pots over a slow fire in the village&#x27;s central plaza. While keeping the pot well stirred, they will serve the beverage in drinking bowls — holding up to &quot;three Parisian quarts&quot; each — to the dancing men, as they pass by. While men are supposed to empty their bowls in one go (and perhaps twenty bowlfuls in a single party), the women take sips more or less continuously.

A drinking party could go on for two or three days, with music, dancing, whistling, and shouting going on all the time. Sometimes the men would force themselves to throw up in order to continue drinking. Leaving the party would be considered a great shame, &quot;worse than among Germans&quot;. Curiously, the Tupinambá do not eat during their drinking parties, just as they do not drink at meals; and they find the European custom of mixing the two things very strange.

Jean de Léry reports that he and his companions tried to prepare &quot;clean&quot; cauim by grinding and cooking manioc or maize, without the chewing step; but (predictably) it did not work. Eventually they got used to the natives&#x27; drink. &quot;To those readers who are put off by the idea of drinking what someone else has chewed,&quot; adds the traveler, &quot;let me remind them of how our wine is made ... by the peasants who trample on the grapes with their feet, sometimes with shoes and all; things that are perhaps even less agreeable than the chewing of American women. Just as one says that wine, by fermenting, rids itself of all impurity; so we may assume that cauim purges itself too.&quot;

===Current use===
Cauim is still made by many indigenous communities in Brazil and elsewhere in the Amazon. It is the main staple food for infants of the Tapirapé Indians of the Tapi&#x27;itãwa tribe (Mato Grosso state) until they are two years old.

==Analysis==

Analysis of cauim made from manioc showed that fermentation was due to a large variety of bacteria. As the fermentation progressed, the species &quot;Lactobacillus pentosus&quot; and &quot;L. plantarum&quot; became dominant. The acidity of the final product was due to lactic acid but significant amounts of ethanol and acetic acid were present. A second analysis of cauim made from rice and manioc also showed the presence of yeasts, chiefly &quot;Candida tropicalis&quot;.

<text>Crufts is an international dog show held annually in the United Kingdom, held since 1891, and organised by The Kennel Club. It is the largest show of its kind in the world.

Crufts is primarily a championship conformation show for dogs, and includes a large trade show of mainly dog-related goods and services, as well as competitions in dog agility, obedience, flyball and heelwork to music. Winner of the annual Friends for Life competition which celebrates unsung canine heroes is also announced, and Crufts also hosts the final of Scruffts, a crossbreed competition. It is held over four days (Thursday to Sunday) in early March at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Solihull, England.

Crufts comprises a number of separate competitions. The main competition is for the Best in Show award, which is hotly contested by dogs and their owners from throughout the world.

The Kennel Club was criticised on the BBC programme &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; for allowing breed standards, judging standards and breeding practices which are said to compromise the health of purebred dogs. The programme led various sponsors to withdraw. The BBC dropped Crufts 2009 from their coverage after being unable to agree to terms with The Kennel Club, with Channel 4 broadcasting the event since 2010.

==History==
Crufts was named after its founder, Charles Cruft, who worked as general manager for a dog biscuit manufacturer, travelling to dog shows both in the United Kingdom and internationally, which allowed him to establish contacts and understand the need for higher standards for dog shows. In 1886, Cruft&#x27;s first dog show, billed as the &quot;First Great Terrier Show&quot;, had 57 classes and 600 entries. The first show named &quot;Crufts&quot;—&quot;Cruft&#x27;s Greatest Dog Show&quot;—was held at the Royal Agricultural Hall, Islington, in 1891. It was the first at which all breeds were invited to compete, with around 2,000 dogs and almost 2,500 entries.

With the close of the 19th century, entries had risen to over 3,000, including royal patronage from various European countries and Russia. Due to the First World War, the show was not held between 1918 and 1920. In 1928, the Best In Show class was introduced and awarded to a Greyhound named Primley Sceptre, shown by Herbert Whitley, the founder of what is now Paignton Zoo. In 1934, the competition was sponsored by a cat food manufacturer. In 1936, &quot;The Jubilee Show&quot; had 10,650 entries with the number of breeds totalling 80. The show continued annually and gained popularity each year until Charles&#x27; death in 1938. His widow then ran the show for four years, until she felt unable to do so due to its high demands of time and effort. To ensure the future and reputation of the show (and, of course, her husband&#x27;s work), she sold it to The Kennel Club in 1942.

The show was again interrupted, by the Second World War, and consequently the 1948 show was the first to be held under the new owner, at Olympia in London. The show continued to gain popularity with each passing year. The BBC first televised the show in 1950. The 1954 competition was cancelled due to an electricians&#x27; strike. In 1959, despite an increase in entrance fees, the show set a new world record with 13,211 entrants.

The first Obedience Championships were held in 1955, the same year working sheepdogs were first allowed to enter. In 1978, agility was introduced as a demonstration, to later become a competition in 1980, with an international invitational competition added in 2001. In 1985, the Young Kennel Club was founded to promote dog handling among younger people. Flyball was introduced in 1990, and in 1992, the first Heelwork to Music demonstration was carried out by Mary Ray. In the early 1990s the Kennel Club started to campaign for responsible dog ownership, with emphasis on people choosing the right dog for them, and introduced Discover Dogs area to Crufts, where visitors can meet all currently recognised breeds and chat to breed experts about dog ownership. In 2000, Rescue Dog Agility was added to the programme.

By 1979, the show had to move to Earls Court exhibition centre, as the increasing number of entries and spectators had outgrown the capacity of its previous venue. Soon, the show had to be changed again – the duration had to be increased to three days in 1982, then in 1987 to four days, as its popularity continued to increase. Since 1991, the show, previously always held in London, has been held in the National Exhibition Centre, Solihull.

At the Centenary celebrations in 1991 Crufts was officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the world&#x27;s largest dog show, with 22,973 dogs being exhibited in conformation classes that year. Including agility and other events, it is estimated that an average 28,000 dogs take part in Crufts each year, with an estimated 160,000 human visitors attending the show.
Crufts was formerly televised by the BBC; this ended after the 2008 event (see &quot;Criticism&quot;) and the 2009 event was only shown via the Internet. Since 2010 the show has been broadcast on the commercial channels Channel 4 and More4, attracting over 4.5 million viewers.

In 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Crufts was first postponed, then cancelled for the first time since the electricians&#x27; strike of 1954.

The show was held on 10–13 March 2022, 9–12 March 2023, and 7-10 March 2024.

The show will be held on 6-9 March 2025.

==Competing for Best in Show==
Crufts is not an open competition; dogs must have qualified during the previous year. There are a number of ways of qualifying for the breed classes at Crufts, but dogs typically qualify by obtaining first, second or third place in the relevant class at a Kennel Club-affiliated Championship show where Challenge Certificates are awarded, or by achieving Best in Show, Reserve Best in Show or Best Puppy in Show at a Kennel Club-affiliated Open or General show. Dogs can become qualified for life upon attaining their Kennel Club Stud Book Number.

Dogs begin by competing against others of the same breed, split by gender, age and previous class wins. These classes include &quot;Veteran&quot;, &quot;Special Puppy&quot;, &quot;Special Junior&quot;, &quot;Yearling&quot;, &quot;Post Graduate&quot;, &quot;Mid Limit&quot;, &quot;Limit&quot;, and &quot;Open&quot;. Each is awarded once for dogs and once for bitches. The dog and bitch class winners then compete again for the Dog and Bitch Challenge Certificate (CC). The two CC winners then go head-to-head to determine the Best of Breed.

After the best of each breed has been chosen, they then compete against the others in their Group (in the UK, there are seven Groups: Toys, Gundogs, Utility, Hounds, Working, Pastoral, and Terriers) to find the &quot;Best in Group&quot;. The seven Group winners then compete to find the &quot;Best in Show&quot; and &quot;Reserve Best in Show&quot;.

Best in Show winners receive a replica of the solid silver Keddall Memorial Trophy, and a small cash prize of £200.

As of 2016 the English Cocker Spaniel had been the most successful breed at Crufts, awarded Best In Show seven times, and the Gundog Group is the most successful group, having produced twenty-three Best In Show winners.

== Best in Show winners (since 2006) ==

== Other competitions ==
Crufts hosts a range of other competitions, including agility, obedience and flyball.

Agility is a fast-paced timed competition in which dogs manoeuvre, under guidance from their handlers, through, over, and around various obstacles. Any mistake made is penalised by adding faults to their score. Dogs must qualify during the preceding year to compete in individual or team events, although representative handlers and dogs from England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are invited to compete in the International competitions.

Obedience, held in the ‘Obedience Ring’ requires dogs to obey a set of commands given by their handlers, including off-lead heelwork at different paces, distance control, retrieve, send away, stays and scent discrimination. Dogs qualify by being successful at shows during the preceding year to compete in the Dog and Bitch UK Obedience Championships, UK Inter-Regional Team Competition and the crowd&#x27;s favourite, the Obedience World Cup. The prizes are awarded to the most obedient dog according to the judges. Obreedience is a group version of the activity in which team of four dogs of the same breed compete against other teams in being the most obedient.

Flyball is a relay-style race. Two teams of four dogs compete against each other in a knock-out competition. Each dog jumps a series of four hurdles, and then steps on a box, which is rigged to release a ball. The dog must then return the ball to the start of the course to tag one of its team, who then repeats this process until all the dogs have finished. Teams must qualify during the preceding year.

Crufts also holds both freestyle and heelwork to music competitions, consisting of a choreographed routine, comprising elements of obedience, set to music.

The gamekeepers classes at Crufts focus on judging the suitability of field-bred dogs for use in the field. Dogs entered are of the gundog group, but the conformation of these dogs differs significantly from that of gundogs from show-bred bloodlines, owing to the need for function as a working gundog, and they are judged accordingly.

The Young Kennel Club (YKC) also has its own ring and stand where handlers aged between six and twenty-five compete in Agility, Obedience, Showing, Handling, Heelwork to Music, Flyball, and Grooming. Handlers and dogs must qualify in their discipline during the preceding year.

Crufts hosts the World Champion Junior Handling competition in which National Best Junior Handler winners from around the globe compete. The first World title competition, held in 1984, was judged by Ger Pederson. The winner of this premiere competition was US representative Tracie Laliberte who had won Westminster Kennel Club in 1983. A unique feature of this first competition was the requirement of switching dogs mid-way through the competition.

== Other attractions ==
Crufts regularly attracts over 160,000 visitors to the NEC and more than 155,000 people visited Crufts in 2020. While the main purpose of the event is the search for the best dog in the show, many trade stands sell a wide range of dog-related merchandise or advertise dog-related charities. Many exhibitors include interactive displays in their stands and demonstration of their product and work, i.e. demonstration of canine first aid.

There is also a section known as Discover Dogs where visitors can see almost every breed recognised by the Kennel Club on view, and discuss each breed with knowledgeable owners.

Crufts also holds special shows and demonstrations, where specially trained dogs perform in front of an arena audience, including Police Dogs, Royal Air Force Dogs and Medical Detection Dogs.

==Crossbreeds==
As the Kennel Club also registers crossbreeds, Crufts also hosts many competitions and displays for crossbreeds. They mainly compete in agility, obedience and heelwork to music competitions. The popularity of Crufts and the interest of dog owners who do not own purebreeds convinced the Kennel Club to hold Scruffts, a show similar to Crufts for crossbreed dogs. Scruffts regularly attracts hundreds of entries and dozens of finalists compete for the top prize in a final at Crufts.

== Criticism ==

The Kennel Club was criticised on the August 2008 BBC programme &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; for allowing breed standards, judging standards and breeding practices which are said to compromise the health of purebred dogs. The programme led various sponsors such as Hill&#x27;s Pet Nutrition, Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Dogs Trust to withdraw from their participation in Crufts and other Kennel Club events. The RSPCA stated that it is &quot;concerned about the unacceptably high levels of disability, deformity and disease affecting pedigree dogs&quot;. The BBC dropped Crufts 2009 from its coverage after being unable to agree terms with the Kennel Club. It was reported that Pedigree Petfoods withdrew from sponsorship of Crufts following this programme, but this announcement was made well in advance of the broadcast and for financial reasons. Kennel Club Chairman Ronnie Irving said that &quot;If this programme teaches us anything, I hope it will teach the &#x27;purists&#x27; in some breeds that they simply must get a move on and realise that in these politically correct and well informed days, some old attitudes are simply no longer sustainable.&quot; Maintaining that the majority of dogs are healthy he said that &quot;the roughly 90% of us who thankfully have healthy breeds must continue to guard against exaggeration and must bring pressure to bear on the laggards, otherwise we will – all of us – continue to be tarred with the same brush&quot;.
The Kennel Club initially defended its practices, and criticised the programme as &quot;highly biased&quot;. It also lodged a complaint to regulatory authority Ofcom claiming &quot;unfair treatment and editing&quot;.

The Kennel Club has introduced a new health plan, breed standards for every breed went under review, and show judges were required to choose only healthy dogs. It has also requested regulatory powers from the Government, which would allow the club to take actions against breeders who do not comply with health standards. New breed standards for 209 dog breeds were announced in January 2009, and became effective immediately, but with breeders allowed until June to object. The new standards were said to &quot;not include anything that could in any way be interpreted as encouraging features that might prevent a dog from breathing, walking and seeing freely&quot;. &quot;This will help to prevent the practice of exaggeration, where features that are perceived to be desirable, such as a short muzzle or loose skin, are made more prominent by breeders, and which can have detrimental effects on a dog’s health.&quot;

===RSPCA report===
In February 2009, the results of an independent scientific report commissioned by the RSPCA concluded that &quot;exaggerated physical features and inherited diseases cause serious welfare problems in pedigree dogs&quot;. Quoting Arman (2007), the report states that &quot;Society and sections of the veterinary profession have become &#x27;desensitised to the welfare issues to such an extent that the production of anatomically deformed dogs is neither shocking, nor considered abnormal&#x27;&quot;. It also states that &quot;Breeding practices and efforts by breed societies and kennel clubs, to date, have been ineffective at protecting the welfare of many breeds of domestic dog&quot; and that &quot;changes in breeding and selection practices are urgently required&quot;. The Kennel Club states that the report &quot;fails totally to recognise the real steady progress and advance of scientific knowledge that has already been made in the area of pedigree dog health&quot;.

==In culture==
Poppy Holman&#x27;s play &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot;, based on Crufts, was commissioned as one of Mikron Theatre Company&#x27;s two 2020 productions, was delayed by COVID-19, and premiered in Leeds on 5 June 2021.

<text>Paulistas are the inhabitants of the state of São Paulo, Brazil, and of its antecessor the Capitaincy of São Vicente, whose capital early shifted from the village of São Vicente to the one of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga.

==History==

=== Origin of the Paulistas ===

The paulista history begins with the arrival of João Ramalho Maldonado, a Portuguese adventurer and explorer born in Vouzela, considered the &quot;father of paulistas&quot; and the &quot;founder of paulistanity&quot;. Ramalho left continental Portugal for Terra de Vera Cruz when Catarina Fernandes das Vacas, his wife, was pregnant; the reasons why he left Europe are not known. Living in the Paulista lands probably since 1508, twenty-four years before the beginning of the Portuguese colonization in the region, he soon adapted to the land and the indigenous, coming to know Tibiriçá, a chief who became his friend.

Ramalho got together with the Indian Bartira, Tibiriçá&#x27;s daughter. The wedding ceremony followed an Indian tradition, and a partnership was established between Bartira&#x27;s father and João Ramalho, to the point that Tibiriçá would do nothing without first consulting his son-in-law. Even though he was Portuguese, Ramalho was totally indigenized, his life and his children&#x27;s lives imitated the Indians&#x27;. Ramalho had many wives besides Bartira, his children dated sisters and had children with them, went to war with the Indians and their parties were Indian parties, they lived naked like the Indians themselves. Because he was not married on paper, he had problems with the Jesuits, being expelled from a mass and later excommunicated by the Catholic Church.

With the union of Ramalho and Bartira, a large family of caboclos was born, which spread through generations, thus giving rise to the first paulistas, who, due to the poverty of the Piratininga Fields as well as the poverty of the Capitania of São Vicente itself in the beginning, gave rise to many future bandeirantes who would explore the South American backlands, expand the paulista territory and spread its culture, which suffered many European influences, predominantly Italian, with the immigrations that began at the end of the 19th century.

=== Colonial and imperial period ===
As the bandeirantes gained power and the vice-kingdom of Brazil developed, the Portuguese element predominated in the population, the Indians being either absorbed or killed. But the Captaincy of São Vicente, enlarged by the bandeiras to include Mato Grosso, Goiás, Paraná and Santa Catarina, remained undeveloped, having neither the gold of Minas Gerais nor the sugar cane of Pernambuco, two of the most lucrative products in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century. As a consequence, it did not receive the same influx of black slaves during the 16th and 17th centuries as the more prosperous provinces of Brazil. Nevertheless, the number of black slaves increased substantially in São Paulo during the Brazilian Empire, as the slave traffic reached its peak during the first half of the 19th century. After the abolition of the international slave trade in 1850, many more slaves were transferred from declining regions of Brazil to work in coffee plantations.

=== Economic development of São Paulo ===

The economic development of São Paulo only really took off with the founding of coffee plantations in the nineteenth century. Those coffee plantations were manned, from the beginning, by slaves, and remained so during most of the 19th century. Not even the abolition of the transatlantic trade changed this, with the coffee barons resorting to the import of slaves from the Northeastern and Southern regions. Both the coffee planters and the Brazilian government, however, were aware that the abolition of slavery could be postponed but not avoided at all; as a result, a few experiments in immigration were tried during this period, and some ideas were discussed, including the immigration of Chinese workers. Only in the 1880s, however, did immigration start in earnest.

From then on, immigration was the solution adopted to what was seen as a labour shortage, and Italian and Spanish immigrants made the bulk of the workers brought to coffee plantations; the reasons why ex-slaves were not employed, or were only marginally employed, are unclear and subject to debate. Much is made of a supposed &quot;whitening&quot; ideology, or even &quot;program&quot;, but the cold fact is that, when faced with the impossibility of obtaining European manpower, the coffee barons had no qualms about resorting to Japanese immigrants. A curious fact from this period was the immigration of American Southerners, called Confederados, moving from a country where slavery had been abolished to one where it still existed. Of course, those were not manual workers and did not come to work in coffee plantations.

The wealth produced by coffee culture eventually sparked urbanisation and industrialisation; the growing urban environment attracted even more immigrants, especially Armenians, Italians, Germans, Portuguese, Syrians, and Lebanese. Later, as the foreign immigration declined, a strong chain of internal migration from other regions of Brazil developed.

== Paulista language ==
Initially, the Paulistas, as well as the other populations from Paulista territories, communicated in the Paulista General Language, a creole language formed in the 16th century from ancient Tupi dialects, with influences from the Portuguese and Spanish languages. At the beginning of the 17th century, Paulista bandeiras began a series of raids against the Spanish Jesuit missions in search of Guarani slaves to work in Paulista lands. As a result, the contact established during this period of wars between the Paulistas and the Spanish brought elements of the Guarani language into the language.

Today it has a few registers, being a dead language due to mass immigration and the obligation of the Portuguese language imposed by the governments of Brazil, initially from 1758 on, with a decree by Sebastião José de Carvalho.

<text>The Luzern–Stans–Engelberg railway line is a Swiss narrow gauge rack railway that connects Luzern, via Hergiswil and Stans, to the resort of Engelberg. The line was built by the Stansstad–Engelberg Railway (, StEB), which became the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg Railway (, LSE) when the line was extended to Luzern.

Today the line is owned by the Zentralbahn railway company, which also owns the Brünig line. Trains on the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line use Brünig line tracks to access Luzern from Hergiswil.

==History==


In 1890 the concession to build a line was given from Stansstad to Engelberg. The opening of the &quot;Stansstad-Engelberg-Bahn&quot; (StEB) followed in 1898. The opening of the railway resulted in the early demise of the Stansstad–Stans tramway, which connected Stansstad and Stans between 1893 and 1903.

The line was electrified from its beginning, making it the longest electrically operated railway line of Switzerland at that time. Because of the maximum gradient of 25% on the rack section between Grafenort, Engelberg and Engelberg, it was decided to use three-phase alternating current.

Brown Boveri delivered seven 52 kW motorcoaches, with wooden bodies and side doors to each compartment, between 1898 and 1900, numbered 1 to 7. They also delivered, between 1898 and 1913, five 4-wheeled 110 kW rack bankers which were used beyond Grafenort on the steep uphill section, to assist the motorcoaches up the hill. These were also numbered 1 to 5. All these vehicles survived until 1964.

The railway ended at that time in Stansstad at the Lake of Lucerne. Passengers had to continue by lake steamer or bus. To connect the railway with the national rail network in Hergiswil, where the metre gauge Brünigbahn of SBB had a station, a concession was passed in 1956. However, it took some time to find the money to build the line to Hergiswil. To resolve the problems of old loans, a new company was incorporated in 1959, still named &quot;Elektrische Bahn Stansstad-Engelberg&quot;. In 1960 work on the Lopper tunnel started and on 27 August 1964, the last three-phase train reached Engelberg. The rack line was rebuilt to Brünigbahn standards and a new overhead line for 15 kV 16⅔ Hz was built. On 19 December 1964, the line went back into business as the &quot;Luzern-Stans-Engelberg-Bahn (LSE)&quot;. The new motor coaches were built for the same maximum speed as the contemporary Brünigbahn motive power ().

In 2005 the LSE merged with the Swiss Federal Railway&#x27;s Brünig line to form the Zentralbahn railway company. Formally, the Swiss Federal Railway sold the Brünig line to the LSE which paid for it with its own shares. LSE was subsequently renamed Zentralbahn and 2/3 of its shares are now owned by SBB.

In December 2010, the Grafenort to Engelberg Tunnel opened between Grafenort and Engelberg, bypassing the very steep 25% incline. The bypass resulted in the closure of the former stations of Obermatt ZB and Grünenwald. In late 2012, a new tunnel route was opened between Kriens Mattenhof station and the approaches to Luzern station. The tunnel replaces a less direct surface alignment, allowing the abolition of several congested level crossings and the provision of double track. A new station, Luzern Allmend/Messe, built within the tunnel, serves the Swissporarena.

==Route==

Trains on the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line begin their journey at Luzern Bahnhof, one of Switzerland&#x27;s principal railway stations which is shared with the lines of the Swiss Federal Railways. Shortly after leaving that station, the line enters a tunnel (opened in 2012) which runs under Luzern&#x27;s southern suburbs as far as Kriens Mattenhof station. From here the line runs to Hergiswil, where the LSE line proper diverges from the Brünig line.

Between Luzern and Hergiswil, trains share tracks with the Brünig line and the S-Bahn services. This section is double track as far as the southern end of the Spier tunnel to the north of Hergiswil Matt station; beyond here the line is mainly single track except for passing loops at stations. Between Luzern and Horw, one of the two tracks is dual gauge allowing standard gauge freight trains to serve the adjacent industrial areas.

From Hergiswil the LSE line runs through the Lopper II tunnel, under a shoulder of Mount Pilatus, and then bridges the &quot;Alpnachersee&quot; arm of Lake Lucerne to reach Stansstad. This tunnel and stretch of line was newly built in the 1960s to connect the Stansstad–Engelberg line to the Brünig line. The former line starting from the terminal station at Stansstad steamer pier no longer exists, although the station building still does.

Beyond the current Stansstad station the line continues on its original 1890s route to Stans and Dallenwil, along the valley of the Engelberger Aa river which the line will follow as far as its destination in Engelberg. Wolfenschiessen station is the terminus of the S4 S-Bahn service, and the LSE line continues alone.

The line uses adhesion as far as Grafenort station. Then after this station the line enters the
Grafenort to Engelberg Tunnel, using rack propulsion through the tunnel.
At the point of entering the tunnel, the pre-2010 surface alignment can be seen diverging to the right. The line formerly continued on adhesion as far as Obermatt ZB station, where the rack section started for the climb via Grünenwald station. Here the main road originally crossed the line via an unusual double bascule bridge, used instead of a level crossing because of the presence of the rack rail.
The rack section ended above Grünenwald at the Ghärst passing loop.

At Boden on the outskirts of Engelberg the old and new routes rejoin, and run under adhesion into the terminal Engelberg station.

==Stations==

The service pattern on the Luzern-Hergiswil section is complex because the line is shared by four separately timetabled services: the LSE, the Brünigbahn, and the S4 and S5 S-Bahn services.


== Rolling stock ==

Prior to the opening of the Grafenort-Engelberg tunnel, the line was operated by
BDeh 4/4
electric multiple units. Various combinations of power and trailer cars were used depending on passenger demand, although a maximum of four-car trains could be used over the rack section. Longer trains had to be split at either
Obermatt ZB or when starting from Engelberg,

Since the opening of the tunnel, the line is served by longer trains usually made up of
a HGe 4/4 II locomotive at the uphill (Engelberg) end, then some of the original BDeh 4/4 trailer cars,
then a newer Stadler GSW multiple unit at the valley (Luzern) end. The latter is similar to the Stadler SPATZ but with the addition of a rack system.

For the summer 2013 season a first class panoramic car was added to the Engelberg end of the trains, the service being renamed
&quot;Luzern-Engelberg Express&quot;.

<doc id="650574" wikidata="Q4857260" url="?curid=650574" title="Department of Bantu Education">
<text>The Department of Bantu Education was an organization created by the National Party of South Africa in 1953. The Bantu Education Act, 1953 provided the legislative framework for this department.

==Function of the department==
Before the Bantu Education Act was passed, apartheid in education tended to be implemented in a haphazard and uneven manner. The purpose of the act was to consolidate Bantu education, i.e., education of black people, so that discriminatory educational practices could be uniformly implemented across South Africa. Previously, black education was administered by provincial governments. With the creation of the department, the central national government assumed control of all black education in South Africa. Racial segregation in education became mandatory under the Act.

Initially, a poll tax levied solely on black South Africans was collected to pay for Bantu education. In 1972, the government started using general taxes collected from White South Africans to fund a portion of black education. One of the hallmarks of Bantu education was a disparity between the quality of education available to different ethnic groups. Black education received one-tenth of the resources allocated to white education; throughout apartheid, black children were educated in classes with teacher-pupil ratios of 1:56. Dilapidated school buildings, a lack of textbooks, and poor teacher training were problems that the department was never able (or willing) to address.

==Curricula under the department==
The department sought to equip black students with the abilities needed to function as low-skilled workers. Abstract thinking and subjects deemed to be of no use to manual laborers (such as mathematics and science) were neglected. Teaching an apartheid-friendly version of Christian values to students was also prioritized. In educational materials, black culture was portrayed as primitive, rural, and unchanging.

==Responses==
Many missionary societies provided education to black schoolchildren. These schools were partially funded by the national government but operated with some autonomy. Racial segregation was not a defining feature of missionary education. The Bantu Education Act consolidated educational apartheid and forced mission schools to implement strict racial segregation in order to qualify for financial assistance. Many mission schools refused to co-operate with the National Party government and ceased operating after the passage of the act.

==End of the department==
In 1994, after South Africa&#x27;s first multiracial elections, the department ceased to operate. All of its functions were absorbed by several government departments. Though the post-apartheid government has committed itself to providing quality schooling to students of all races, education in South Africa continues to be hampered by the legacy of the department and other institutions.

<text>The Church of St Margaret, Westminster Abbey is in the grounds of Westminster Abbey on Parliament Square, London, England. It is dedicated to Margaret of Antioch, and forms part of a single World Heritage Site with the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey.

==History and description==
The church was founded in the twelfth century by Benedictine monks, so that local people who lived in the area around the Abbey could worship separately at their own simpler parish church, and historically it was within the hundred of Ossulstone in the county of Middlesex. In 1914, in a preface to &quot;Memorials of St. Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster&quot;, a former Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s, Hensley Henson, reported a mediaeval tradition that the church was as old as Westminster Abbey, owing its origins to the same royal saint, and that &quot;The two churches, conventual and parochial, have stood side by side for more than eight centuries – not, of course, the existing fabrics, but older churches of which the existing fabrics are successors on the same site.&quot;

St Margaret&#x27;s was rebuilt from 1486 to 1523, at the instigation of King Henry VII, and the new church, which largely still stands today, was consecrated on 9 April 1523. It has been called &quot;the last church in London decorated in the Catholic tradition before the Reformation&quot;, and on each side of a large rood cross there stood richly painted statues of St Mary and St John, while the building had several internal chapels. In the 1540s, the new church came near to demolition, when Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, planned to take it down to provide good-quality materials for Somerset House, his own new palace in the Strand. He was only kept from carrying out his plan by the resistance of armed parishioners.

In 1614, St Margaret&#x27;s became the parish church of the Palace of Westminster, when the Puritans of the seventeenth century, unhappy with the highly liturgical Abbey, chose to hold their Parliamentary services in a church they found more suitable: a practice that has continued since that time. An additional detached burial ground was added in 1625 at what is now Christchurch Gardens.

Between 1734 and 1738, the north-west tower was rebuilt to designs by John James; at the same time, the whole structure was encased in Portland stone. Both the eastern and the western porch were added later, with J. L. Pearson as architect. In 1878, the church&#x27;s interior was greatly restored and altered to its current appearance by Sir George Gilbert Scott, although many Tudor features were retained.

In 1863, during preliminary explorations preparing for this restoration, Scott found several doors overlaid with what was believed to be human skin. After doctors had examined this skin, Victorian historians theorized that the skin might have been that of William the Sacrist, who organized a gang that, in 1303, robbed the King of the equivalent of, in modern currency, $100 million (see Richard of Pudlicott). It was a complex scheme, involving several gang members disguised as monks planting bushes on the palace. After the stealthy burglary six months later, the loot was concealed in these bushes. The historians believed that William the Sacrist was flayed alive as punishment and his skin was used to make these royal doors, perhaps situated initially at nearby Westminster Palace. Subsequent study revealed that the skins were bovine in origin, not human. 

By the 1970s, the number of people living nearby was in the hundreds. Ecclesiastical responsibility for the parish was reallocated to neighbouring parishes by the Westminster Abbey and Saint Margaret Westminster Act 1972, and the church was brought under the authority of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey.

An annual new year service for the Coptic Orthodox Church in Britain takes place in the church in October, and in 2016 Bishop Angaelos gave the sermon.

The Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s is often a canon of Westminster Abbey.

===Commemorative windows===

Notable windows include the east window of 1509 of Flemish stained glass, created to commemorate the betrothal of Catherine of Aragon to Henry VIII. This has had a chequered history. It was given by Henry VII to Waltham Abbey in Essex, and at the Dissolution of the Monasteries the last Abbot sent it to a private chapel at New Hall, Essex. That came into the possession of Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, the father of Anne Boleyn, then Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, next George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, after him Oliver Cromwell, from whom it reverted to the second Duke of Buckingham, next General Monk, Duke of Albemarle, and after him John Olmius, then Mr Conyers of Copt Hall, Essex, whose son sold the window to the parish of St Margaret&#x27;s in 1758, for 400 guineas. The money came from a grant of £4,000, which parliament had made to the parish that year for the renovation of the church and the rebuilding of the chancel.

Other windows commemorate William Caxton, England&#x27;s first printer, who was buried at the church in 1491, Sir Walter Raleigh, executed in Old Palace Yard and then also buried in the church in 1618, the poet John Milton, a parishioner of the church, and Admiral Robert Blake.

The Victorian glass that once filled the eight bays of the south aisle was destroyed by enemy action during the Second World War. In 1966, all eight windows were provided with new glass designed by John Piper and made by his longtime collaborator Patrick Reyntiens. Piper&#x27;s unified scheme filled each window with an uncompromisingly modern abstract design, intended to create a &quot;total impression of living radiance, in shades of silvery grey predominantly with splashes of pale greens, yellows and blues in varied density, to filter the daylight.&quot; The new windows were dedicated on 15 January 1967 in memory of Canon Carnegie and his wife, Peter Kemp-Welch, Clarence Fletcher and Richard Costain.

==Weddings==
As well as marrying its own parishioners, the church has long been a popular venue for society weddings, as Members of Parliament, peers, and officers of the House of Lords and House of Commons can choose to be married in it. Notable weddings include:

*5 July 1631: Edmund Waller and Anne Banks, who was an heiress and a ward of the Court of Aldermen, were married at the church in defiance of orders of the Court and the Privy Council of England. Waller had previously carried the bride off and been forced to return her. On a complaint being made to the Star Chamber, Waller was pardoned by King Charles I.
* 13 May 1654: Lady Mary Springett (William Penn&#x27;s mother-in-law) and Isaac Pennington
* 1 December 1655: Samuel Pepys and Elisabeth Marchant de St. Michel
* 12 November 1656: John Milton and Katherine Woodcock
* 12 June 1895: William Hicks and Grace Lynn Joynson
* 12 September 1908: Winston Churchill and Clementine Hozier
* 21 April 1920: Harold Macmillan, and Lady Dorothy Cavendish
* 18 July 1922: Lord Louis Mountbatten, and Edwina Ashley
* 8 October 1993: David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley, and the Hon. Serena Stanhope

Other notable weddings include some of the Bright Young People.

==Baptisms==

*Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland, eldest son of Barbara Villiers, was christened in the church on 16 June 1662, when the father&#x27;s name was given as her husband, Lord Castlemaine, instead of as the King, who later acknowledged the child as his. In October 1850 &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported this entry and claimed it as &quot;an untruth&quot; and &quot;a new fact in the secret history of Charles II&quot;.
*Thomas Pelham-Clinton, 3rd Duke of Newcastle, 28 July 1752
*Olaudah Equiano, a slave who bought his freedom, becoming a key abolitionist, was christened as Gustavus on 9 February 1759, when he was described in the parish register as &quot;Gustavus Vassa a Black born in Carolina 12 years old&quot;.

==Burials==

==Other notable events==
On Easter day 1555 in the reign of Mary I a Protestant ex-Benedictine monk, William Flower inflicted wounds to the administerer of the sacrament. He repented for the injuries but would not repent his motive which was rejection of the doctrine of transubstantiation. He was thus sentenced for heresy and a week later severed of his hand and burned at the stake outside the church.

During the First World War, Edward Lyttelton, headmaster of Eton, gave a sermon in the church on the theme of &quot;loving your enemies&quot;, promoting the view that any post-war treaty with Germany should be a just one and not vindictive. He had to leave the church after the service by a back door, while a number of demonstrators sang &quot;Rule Britannia!&quot; in protest at his attitude.

==Choirs==
Until 2019, the treble choristers for St Margaret&#x27;s were supplied by Westminster Under School. In September 2023, a new choir for girls aged 11 to 17 was formed, to sing for regular liturgical services alongside the professional singers of the St Margaret&#x27;s Consort.

The church also hosted the first performance by the UK Parliament Choir under Simon Over in 2000.

==Organ==
An organ was installed in 1806 by John Avery. The current organ is largely built by J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

<text>Henry Coppée (October 13, 1821 – March 22, 1895) was an American educator and author. He was the first president of Lehigh University.

==Early life and education==
Coppée was born in Savannah, Georgia. His family was initially from France and settled in Haiti. 

Coppée studied at Yale University for two years, and then worked as a civil engineer. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, in 1845. He completed a Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Georgia in 1848. He earned his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and Union College of New York in 1866.

==Career==
===Military and early education career===
Coppée served in the Mexican–American War as a lieutenant and was brevetted captain for gallantry at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco. During the American Civil War, he edited the &quot;United States Service Magazine&quot;.

He was assistant professor of French at West Point from 1848 to 1849, and then principal assistant professor of geography, history, and ethics from 1850 to 1855. 

He resigned from the Army on June 30, 1855.

After resigning from the U.S. Army, he was the professor of English literature and history at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, from 1855 to 1866. In 1856, Coppée was elected to the American Philosophical Society. 

He was an officer for the Aztec Club of 1847, serving as a vice president from 1885 to 1887; and as president from 1887 to 1888. 

===Lehigh University===

In 1866, Coppée was selected by Asa Packer to serve as the first president of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; he held this position for nine years, until 1875. He also served as the university&#x27;s president &quot;pro tempore&quot; twice. Following the resignation of Lehigh&#x27;s second president John M. Leavitt in 1880, he served in this capacity for several months. Later, following the death of Robert A. Lamberton in September 1893, he again served in this capacity until his own death on March 22, 1895.

During Coppée&#x27;s tenure, the university underwent extensive development, including the construction of a number of new buildings and the expansion of the campus. A Moravian church on Packer Avenue was remodeled into Christmas Hall, a house for the president was erected, and Packer Hall, the university center, was built. Coppée lectured in history, logic, rhetoric, political economy, and Shakespeare.

Lehigh University&#x27;s Coppee Hall, built in 1883, was named for him; it was first a gymnasium, later the home of the Department of Arts and Science, and now houses the university&#x27;s Journalism and Communication Department.

==Personal life==
He was a Christian, and compiled &quot;Songs of Praise in the Christian Centuries&quot;.

==Death==
Coppée died March 22, 1895 at the age of 73. He was survived by his wife, Julie (nee de Witt), and four daughters and one son.

<text>New York State Route 32 (NY 32) is a north–south state highway that extends for through the Hudson Valley and Capital District regions of the U.S. state of New York. It is a two-lane surface road for nearly its entire length, with few divided sections. From Harriman to Albany, it is closely parallel to Interstate 87 (I-87) and U.S. Route 9W (US 9W), overlapping with the latter in several places.

NY 32 begins at NY 17 on the outskirts of the New York metropolitan area in Woodbury just outside Harriman, and ends at NY 196 east of Hudson Falls just south of the Adirondacks. In between, the road passes through the cities of Newburgh, Kingston, Albany, Cohoes, and Glens Falls. Outside of the cities, it offers views of the Hudson Highlands, Shawangunk Ridge, Catskill Mountains, and, during an overlap with US 4 north of Albany, the Hudson River.

The roads now making up the highway were originally part of several privately maintained turnpikes, which fostered settlements along the corridor. Once part of the former NY 58, it has been NY 32 since 1930. Only one of three letter-suffixed spur routes remains.

==Route description==
Maintenance of NY 32 is split between the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and the highway departments of several different jurisdictions. Within the cities of Newburgh and Watervliet, the route is entirely city-maintained. In four other cities—Albany, Cohoes, Glens Falls, and Kingston—NY 32 is mostly locally maintained. The piece of the route in the city of Mechanicville, meanwhile, is city-maintained north of Frances Street, a local street four blocks south of NY 67. One last locally maintained section exists in the Albany suburb of Bethlehem, where the route is county-maintained between Feura Bush Road and the Delmar Bypass. This section is co-signed as County Route 52 (CR 52), which continues northwest of NY 32 to a junction with NY 140 near Slingerlands.

===Harriman to Newburgh===
NY 32 begins where NY 17 leaves the Quickway overpass west of the New York State Thruway toll barrier, just north of the Harriman village line in Woodbury. To the east is Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, across from Central Valley Elementary School of the Monroe–Woodbury Central School District. Beyond the mall, site of many major traffic jams, NY 32 descends into downtown Central Valley. north is another of the Town of Woodbury&#x27;s hamlets, Highland Mills. Beyond the Rushmore Memorial Library at the north end of the hamlet the road bends slightly east upon reaching the southeastern foot of Orange County&#x27;s highest peak, Schunemunk Mountain.
Shortly after Highland Mills, the Port Jervis Line, operated by Metro-North Railroad, crosses over on a high trestle. After crossing over Woodbury Creek and under the Thruway, NY 32 runs along the eastern side of the narrow valley between Schunemunk and the Hudson Highlands. This section of highway runs through mostly wooded terrain as it leaves Woodbury for Cornwall.

Just north of Mountainville and the north end of Schunemunk, the road crosses Moodna Creek downstream from the Woodbury Creek confluence. The intersection with Angola Road to the south was once the beginning of the former NY 307; it is now the west end of CR 107. Across the creek from CR 107 is Orrs Mills Road, another county road that leads to Storm King Art Center.
The road climbs gently out of the creek valley and enters development. At north of Angola Road, it crosses the New Windsor town line and reaches the complicated five-way intersection at the center of Vails Gate, intersecting NY 94 and the beginning of NY 300. The next include a middle turn lane as NY 32 becomes New Windsor&#x27;s main commercial strip. This section ends at Temple Hill Avenue, with Snake Hill to the west. The road remains heavily commercial as it enters the city of Newburgh as the wide Lake Street.

At Broadway (NY 17K), Newburgh&#x27;s main street, NY 32 turns east. The brief, unsigned concurrency ends where 17K terminates at US 9W (Robinson Avenue), at the former Broadway School. NY 32, however, turns north again, beginning the first of several concurrencies with US 9W.

The two highways remain joined for the next as they pass the Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux-designed Downing Park and reach the city limit, where I-84 and NY 52 cross the highway heading towards the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge. Immediately beyond that junction, NY 32 separates from US 9W and heads northwest.

===Newburgh to New Paltz===
Newburgh has a commercial strip north of the city, featuring the Mid-Valley Mall and another large shopping plaza built around a supermarket anchor. This development ends after when 32 passes the Town of Newburgh&#x27;s Cronomer Hill Park on the south, near a short drive to the summit observation tower. more brings NY 32 to the center of the hamlet of Cronomer Valley and an unusual junction with NY 300. At what seems to be a conventional four-way intersection regulated by a traffic light, both highways turn, and it is necessary to turn to the northeast to stay on NY 32 headed north. Traffic that goes straight at this intersection flows onto NY 300.

From this intersection, NY 32 passes Chadwick Lake, the town&#x27;s reservoir, and continues straight north through much less-developed, mostly wooded countryside for to the Ulster County line, almost the point at which the woods diminish. Barely into Plattekill, the highway crosses the Thruway again. It curves northwards shortly thereafter, retaining a slightly westward trend through mostly open fields near the Shawangunk Ridge. At from the Thruway, NY 32 intersects US 44 and NY 55 in the center of another Town of Plattekill hamlet, Modena. A short distance beyond, the highway crosses into Gardiner, taking a wide bend around Locust Lawn, the Federal-style home of early 19th-century politician Josiah Hasbrouck.

North of Modena, the surrounding area becomes slightly more wooded near where NY 32 crosses into the Town of New Paltz. The highway curves before entering the village next to the campus of State University of New York at New Paltz. Two blocks north of campus, at New Paltz Middle School, it turns west at a traffic signal to join NY 299 as the village&#x27;s Main Street.

===New Paltz to Kingston===
While NY 32 officially remains concurrent with NY 299 all the way to the traffic light at the northern terminus of NY 208, a sign at the Elting Memorial Library, just before the center of downtown, directs northbound traffic on the highway down North Front Street. This shortcut allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection and head out of the village on North Chestnut Street. Once past the village, the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east. NY 32 then becomes mostly rural again.
Over the next , the road trends easterly until NY 213 joins it from the east right before the bridge over the Wallkill. Now concurrent, 32 and 213 bend away from the Thruway and pass through the hamlet of Tillson and then descend to cross Rondout Creek at the former village of Rosendale. Just after the crossing, at the Stewart&#x27;s, NY 213 leaves to the west along the creek, ending a concurrency.
From Rosendale, NY 32 climbs up out of the Rondout valley and veers east into the hamlet of Maple Hill, where it crosses over the Thruway once again. It resumes a northerly course through Bloomington, and several miles further on crosses the Kingston city line. This entire segment of NY 32 is also concurrent with New York State Bicycle Route 32.

===Kingston and Saugerties===
On its route through Kingston, NY 32 frequently changes streets and directions. It enters town as Boulevard and meanders to just past Washington Avenue, where it splits onto the more easterly Greenkill Avenue and Fair Street for several blocks. NY 213 returns, merging from the south as Wilbur Avenue. The joined routes then turn onto Clinton Avenue for two blocks, then east onto Henry Street for about to Broadway, where NY 32 turns north and NY 213 ends.

Another brings Broadway to the wide junction where I-587 and NY 28 both terminate. NY 32 follows Albany Avenue northeast to Flatbush Avenue, where it turns to assume an eastward course. This finally bends slightly north to East Chester Street near the city limit, where US 9W again comes in to begin a brief wrong-way concurrency in which NY 32 north is US 9W south. It ends, unsigned, after with US 9W&#x27;s turn onto Frank Koenig Boulevard.

Continuing as Flatbush Road into the Town of Ulster, NY 32 is for the first time along its route east of US 9W and closer to the river. It encounters NY 199 at an interchange immediately west of the Kingston–Rhinecliff Bridge. Soon after, it passes Kingston–Ulster Airport. It remains on a northerly heading until south of Saugerties, where it veers west and merges with US 9W again. The two routes cross Esopus Creek and enter the village, where Partition Street gives way to Main Street. At that T intersection, US 9W turns to continue north, while NY 32 picks up the new NY 212 and heads west out of town.

===The Catskills to Albany===
After one block of Main Street, NY 32 and NY 212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the railroad tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY 32 has crossed the Thruway, is the first time it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY 32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY 32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.

At this point, the distance between NY 32 and the Thruway begins to widen. At the junction with Malden Turnpike (CR 34), NY 32 turns westward, toward the Catskill Escarpment, and starts climbing through some rock cuts. When Blue Mountain Road (CR 35) comes in from the south, NY 32 resumes heading north, parallel to the ridge. from that junction, its only suffixed route, NY 32A, splits off to the west to provide direct access via NY 23A and Kaaterskill Clove to Tannersville and Hunter.

After crossing into Greene County, the road intersects NY 23A at an undeveloped junction. NY 32 remains in its straight course through the lowlands below the escarpment, passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around the north side of Cairo Roundtop before it joins with NY 23 at Cairo. After , NY 32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north-northeast just south of Freehold.

North of Freehold the road begins to climb. Views south to the Catskills appear as it nears the center of Greenville, where it crosses NY 81. further on, NY 32 enters Albany County via Westerlo near the Basic Creek Reservoir. The climbing stops another mile after the county line, where NY 32 reaches its highest elevation, , on the plateaus south of the Helderberg Escarpment. The road starts to curve back east as the surrounding landscape opens up, with larger fields surrounding it and a slow descent to the Hudson beginning.

After sharing of road with NY 143, crossing the northern end of Alcove Reservoir and descending the southern end of the Helderberg Escarpment, the road veers eastward toward Albany. To get there, it crosses into New Scotland just after the hamlet of Feura Bush and crosses a long bridge over the northern end of the busy rail yard northwest of Selkirk, where freight trains bound for New York City wait before crossing the Hudson at the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge.
The landscape becomes more developed, though still rural, as the highway winds past a SABIC plant and other development accompanying the rail yard, entering the town of Bethlehem. At the southern corner of Delmar, NY 32 turns more to the east becomes a divided highway with grade intersections, the only non-concurrent segment of NY 32 to take this form. This segment continues, largely undeveloped, as it intersects NY 335 and crosses under the Thruway for the last time before reaching its final concurrency with US 9W. east of the Thruway, NY 32 again breaks from 9W and follows residential Corning Hill Road downhill to River Road, where it turns to the north again and crosses the Normans Kill into Albany, becoming South Pearl Street, and then paralleling I-787 for a short distance past the Port of Albany–Rensselaer before crossing underneath it.

===Albany to Hudson Falls===
NY 32 follows South Pearl Street between the Mansion and Pastures neighborhoods, intersecting US 20 (Madison Avenue) near the approach to the Dunn Memorial Bridge, and then becoming one of the two main streets of downtown Albany. At Clinton Square and the Palace Theatre it intersects US 9 along Clinton Avenue. Near the city limits, NY 32 passes under I-90. Upon crossing into the neighboring village of Menands, NY 32 bears onto Wolfert Avenue to access Broadway. Broadway, a business thoroughfare originating in downtown Albany, is designated NY 910C, an unsigned reference route, for south of Wolfert Avenue to the Albany city line. NY 32 occupies Broadway north of Wolfert Avenue, right at the former headquarters of Albany International, paralleling I-787. I-787&#x27;s exit 6 ramps meet NY 32 in Menands, then NY 32 crosses over railroad tracks and soon leaves the village. NY 32 enters the hamlet of Schuyler Heights in the town of Colonie. After a short stretch the road enters the city of Watervliet where the name changes from Broadway to Third Avenue. The Watervliet Arsenal forces NY 32 to curve northeasterly as Ninth Street. Then at a traffic signal NY 32 turns left onto Broadway.

At 13th Street, NY 32 leaves Broadway and follows 13th two blocks west to an intersection with 2nd Avenue. Here, NY 155 begins and occupies 13th Street to the west of 2nd Avenue while NY 32 turns north onto 2nd. NY 32 continues in the vicinity of I-787 and its continuation, NY 787, through Watervliet and back into the town of Colonie, this time it is through the hamlet of Maplewood, to Cohoes, where NY 787 ends at NY 32 near the convergence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers at New Courtland Street. Past NY 787, NY 32 crosses the Mohawk River into Saratoga County and the town of Waterford, after crossing into the village of Waterford NY 32 crosses the Erie Canal before intersecting US 4 in the heart of the village. The two routes merge, forming an overlap northward along the Hudson River.

In Mechanicville, US 4 and NY 32 briefly overlap NY 67. Farther north, the two routes split north of Stillwater at the southern edge of the Saratoga National Historical Park. While US 4 straddles the park to the east, NY 32 follows the southern and western extents of the park before rejoining US 4 south of Schuylerville. In Schuylerville, the two routes are concurrent with NY 29 for a short distance before exiting the village. To the north of the village in Northumberland, NY 32 separates from US 4 and heads northwest to Gansevoort, where it meets NY 50. NY 32 continues north on the right-of-way of NY 50 to South Glens Falls, where US 9 joins NY 32 northward across the Hudson River into Glens Falls.

Shortly after entering the city, NY 32 turns onto Warren Street, splitting from US 9 and following the Hudson River east toward Hudson Falls. At Highland Avenue, NY 32 turns east, following Highland past Quaker Road (NY 254) to Dix Avenue, where it merges east onto Dix. NY 32 remains on Dix into Hudson Falls, intersecting US 4 one last time north of the village before continuing through the intersection onto Burgoyne Avenue. The route follows Burgoyne Avenue southward around the northeastern portion of Hudson Falls to NY 196, where NY 32 terminates. Burgoyne Avenue continues southwestward as CR 37 to US 4 in Fort Edward.

==History==

===Old roads===
South of Mountainville, NY 32 was part of the New Windsor and Cornwall Turnpike, which stretched from the Orange Turnpike at Southfields to New Windsor. The turnpike became NY 17 south of Harriman. North of Newburgh, the road follows the Newburgh and Sullivan Turnpike to the NY 300 junction and the old Plattekill Turnpike from NY 300 to Ulster County. South of Newburgh, the road became part of the West Shore Route auto trail; from Albany to Watervliet, the road was the northern extension of the New York-Albany-Troy Post Route trail.

===Designation===
The segment of modern NY 32 between Albany and Mechanicville was designated as part of NY 6 in 1924. From Mechanicville to Hudson Falls, the current routing of NY 32 became part of NY 30. By 1926, the portion of what is now NY 32 from Harriman to Newburgh was designated NY 58. From Newburgh to Albany, NY 32 remained unnumbered at the time. When U.S. Routes were first assigned in New York in 1927, the portion of NY 6 from Albany to Waterford was designated as the northernmost portion of US 9W. In Waterford, US 9W merged with US 9E and continued north as US 9 to Mechanicville, where US 9 turned west onto modern NY 67.

In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US 9W was truncated to Albany while US 9 was rerouted to follow a new stretch between Albany and Round Lake. The former routing of both routes along the Hudson River between Albany and Mechanicville, as well as the entirety of NY 58 and the portion of NY 30 from Schuylerville to Glens Falls was integrated into the new NY 32, which followed its current routing between Harriman and the Stillwater community of Bemis Heights and from Schuylerville to Glens Falls. Between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville, NY 32 followed what is now US 4 along the Hudson River while the former routing of NY 30 between the two locations became NY 32A. At the same time, US 4, which previously ended in Glens Falls, was rerouted south of Hudson Falls to end in East Greenbush. From Northumberland to Waterford, the route used what is now NY 32.

===Reroutings===

NY 32 has been realigned in several locations since its inception in 1930. When the route was initially assigned, it passed through Palenville instead of bypassing it to the east as it does today. In the early 1940s, NY 32 was rerouted to follow a new highway east of the hamlet. NY 32&#x27;s former routing into Palenville was redesignated as NY 32A. The original NY 32A in Saratoga County—which was redundant to US 4—was supplanted at this time by a rerouted NY 32. The Bemis Heights–Schuylerville portion of the overlap between US 4 and NY 32 was eliminated in the 1950s when the original routing of NY 32 between the two locations was upgraded. Construction on the highway began in the mid-1950s and was completed by 1958, at which time US 4 was rerouted to follow the riverside roadway.

In Bethlehem, a southern suburb of Albany, NY 32 was originally routed on Feura Bush Road between the hamlets of Feura Bush and Glenmont. North of Glenmont, NY 32 followed what is now NY 144. In 1956, the Albany County Board of Supervisors asked the state of New York to develop a highway that would reduce the amount of traffic on NY 43 (now NY 443) in Bethlehem. The original plans released by the state in 1959 called for a four-lane divided highway between NY 85 in New Scotland and US 9W in Bethlehem. The new road, known as the Delmar Bypass, would run south of the hamlets of Slingerlands, Delmar, and Elsmere, and loosely parallel Feura Bush Road to the north between Elm Avenue and US 9W.

By February 1961, however, the state favored a new alignment that brought the bypass north from Elm Avenue to Slingerlands, where it would connect to the proposed Slingerlands Bypass north of NY 85. As a result, the road would run through the western part of Delmar and the eastern section of Slingerlands. The change in plans was met with stiff opposition from area residents at a February 8 public hearing, and the Bethlehem Town Board unanimously voted to oppose the altered route at a meeting one week later. Both actions eventually led the state to cancel the portion of the route west of Elm Avenue in January 1963. The portion east of Elm Avenue was completed in December 1963 and became part of a realigned NY 32 in the 1970s. Part of the right-of-way for the Delmar Bypass near Slingerlands was eventually used for a realignment of NY 140 named Cherry Avenue Extension. NY 32&#x27;s former routing along Feura Bush Road is still state-maintained as NY 910A, an unsigned reference route.

NY 32 ended in downtown Glens Falls until January 1, 1949, when the highway was extended east to US 4 in Hudson Falls by way of Warren Street, Boulevard, and Feeder Street. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of Boulevard between Highland Avenue and the Washington County line was transferred from the state of New York to Warren County in exchange for control over Highland and Dix avenues between Warren Avenue and the Washington County line. In Hudson Falls, Boulevard and the segment of Feeder Street south of Boulevard were given to Washington County on April 1 of the following year in return for ownership and maintenance over all of Dix and Burgoyne avenues north of NY 196. NY 32 was rerouted to follow Highland, Dix, and Burgoyne avenues shortly afterward.

===Rondout Creek bridge rehabilitation===

In June 2008, NYSDOT began a rehabilitation project of the bridge over Rondout Creek in Rosendale. The project involved rehabilitating the bridge one half at a time. The project was slated to have the 74-year-old bridge up to standards by the fall of 2009. It also included improvements to the road leading up to the bridge. Having only one lane open at a time congested traffic in the area. The total cost of the project was $5.5 million. The bridge had been refurbished before, in 1970.

==Future==
In several locations, traffic congestion along NY 32 has led to suggestions to change or modify the road. The problems are most severe at the southern terminus, but it is not the only section of the road with issues.

===Woodbury Commons===

The road&#x27;s southern terminus at Woodbury Commons is the most frequent topic of discussion, especially since Black Friday in 2001, when heavy traffic from holiday shoppers along adjacent sections of not only 32 but routes 6 and 17 and the Thruway came to a complete standstill. &quot;This should have been planned for and it wasn&#x27;t&quot;, complained one local official. &quot;Now you&#x27;re trying to close the door and the horse is already out&quot;. Despite several efforts and the presence of state police on later Black Fridays, a similar traffic jam occurred on Labor Day weekend 2006, when a break in bad weather led to an increase in shoppers so marked that US 6 and the Thruway were backed up as far as the Palisades Interstate Parkway and Newburgh, respectively. The Woodbury police chief cited the blockage created by drivers making the left turn from NY 32 to the Thruway as the cause. Plans to build an exit ramp that would allow that traffic to go directly to the tollbooth have been expedited.
On the weekend of August 17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two hours to get to the Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on NY 17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum&#x27;s death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A traffic light that had been malfunctioning after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.

In 2007, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) officials announced their long-term plan to prevent further traffic jams. They will create a series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound NY 32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights in front of the mall. The changes were expected to be complete by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the NY 17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state. The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded.

In 2016, NYSDOT announced a new five-year capital spending plan that included the exit 131 project. Construction is not expected to begin until 2018 at the earliest. Before beginning, the agency says it must acquire , permanent easements over another and temporary easements over . The revised plan, DOT says, will allow it to shorten the timetable and complete the project in one phase instead of the two originally planned. It was expected to cost $115 million.

Late in 2017, Cuomo revealed details of NYSDOT&#x27;s new plan at a news conference. The main element would include converting the interchange into a diverging diamond, where traffic would switch sides of the road on the overpass so both left and right turns onto NY 17 would not have to be made against opposing traffic; in order to meet federal clearance requirements for Interstate Highway standards, NY 17, gradually being converted into I-86, will be lowered by beneath the new overpass. Nininger Road (CR 64), which currently ends at NY 32 just north of the interchange, would also be extended to the east and grade separated as well, passing underneath NY 32 in a new overpass to connect to a roundabout where it would meet a new access road to the mall and an offramp from northbound NY 32. Cuomo said the new plan would cost $150 million and be completed by November 2019.

===Vails Gate===
The &quot;Five Corners&quot; intersection of NY 32 and NY 94 at Vails Gate was a four-way junction until World War II, when the Army extended Temple Hill Road, later NY 300, southeast to the junction so that troops and materiel could get between West Point and the airbase at what was then Stewart Field more quickly. It did not become a traffic problem until the 1990s, when gas stations, supermarkets, strip malls and fast-food restaurants had been built on every corner.

By the end of the 20th century, the intersection was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded the intersection with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars&#x27; stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.

===Downtown New Paltz===

Another choke point has been Main Street in New Paltz, a section shared by NY 32 and NY 299. This is the main route back to the Thruway and downstate from the heavily used hiking and climbing areas at Mohonk Preserve and Minnewaska State Park Preserve in the Shawangunks. It is also a well-developed commercial area in a college town, with ample street parking.

Traffic through the village has been so heavy on weekends during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making Main Street one-way, carrying traffic only to the west, while diverting eastbound traffic onto either of two parallel streets. Other villages that have made such changes found making streets one-way decreased business at their retailers.

After four years of studying and reviewing the issue, the town and the village agreed to make the change. In 2007, however, the village&#x27;s new mayor, who had supported the plan while a trustee, changed his mind and said the village&#x27;s support was &quot;on hold&quot;. While campaigning, he said, few village residents had expressed support for the plan. What he learned since taking over as mayor had only further convinced him that it was mostly town residents who wanted the street changes. He also believed that making Main Street one-way would reduce the total amount of routes available to vehicles passing through the village and would adversely route traffic away from the businesses along Main.

==Major intersections==
























==Suffixed routes==
Originally, NY 32 had two suffixed routes, NY 32A and NY 32B, that were absorbed by other routes. The NY 32A designation has since been revived for a short connector in the Hudson Valley.
* The NY 32A designation has been used for two distinct highways:
** The first NY 32A was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the segment of modern NY 32 between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville in Saratoga County. At the time, NY 32 was routed on what is now US 4 between the two locations. The route was supplanted by a realigned NY 32 in the early 1940s.
** The current NY 32A is a connector between NY 32 and NY 23A in Ulster and Greene counties. It was assigned in the early 1940s.
* NY 32B was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering to an alternate route of NY 32 between Northumberland and Glens Falls in Saratoga, Washington, and Warren counties. It was truncated northward to Hudson Falls in the early 1940s and mostly replaced by NY 254 .

<text>The Flakpanzer IV &quot;Ostwind&quot; (East Wind in English) was a German self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier &quot;Flakpanzer IV/2 cm Vierling&quot; &quot;Wirbelwind&quot;.

The Panzer IV&#x27;s turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret that housed a 3.7 cm Flak 43. In addition to its intended role as an anti-aircraft weapon, the fast-firing gun was highly effective against light vehicles and minor fortifications. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun.

The &quot;Ostwind&#x27;s&quot; main improvement over the &quot;Wirbelwind&quot; was the FlaK 43&#x27;s increased range and stopping power over the 2 cm Flakvierling 38 and slightly better armor on its turret, albeit it had a lower fire rate. To solve this problem a project was undertaken to arm the Ostwind with two 37 mm cannons, known as the Ostwind II. A single prototype was built but the war ended before anything truly became of it.

Although an order for 100 vehicles was placed in August 1944, only 44 vehicles were completed (22 converted from existing Panzer IVs and 22 new production vehicles) from December 1944 to March 1945.

<text>Semacode is a software company based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It is also this company&#x27;s trade name for their machine-readable ISO/IEC 16022 Data Matrix barcodes, which are used to encode Internet URLs.

Semacodes are primarily aimed at being used with cellular phones which have built-in cameras, to quickly capture a Web site address for use in the phone&#x27;s web browser. Semacodes are in fact DataMatrix encoded URLs.

The Semacode website states that Semacode tags are an &quot;open system&quot; and that tag creation is &quot;completely unrestricted,&quot; with the SDK software tools being free of charge for non-commercial use.

Potential uses for Semacode tags are still being explored, and will complement development of the concept of using mobile phones as devices for information gathering and exchange. Suggestions from the Semacode.org website included:

* placing Semacode tags on posters, such as those for concerts and public performances. Those interested could use their mobile phone to take a photo of the tag, which could link them directly to the web page where they could order tickets.
* using Semacode tags and mobile phones to enable multilingual museum exhibits—a tag photographed at the exhibition entrance could set a language cookie in the phone&#x27;s web browser, and subsequent Semacode tags displayed at each exhibit could then link the phone&#x27;s browser directly to a web page about the item, displayed in the user&#x27;s language of choice.
* placing Semacode tags on name tags given to conference attendees. These tags could provide the corporate web address of each attendee&#x27;s company, or their biography and contact details.

<text>Parliament Square is a square at the northwest end of the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster in central London, England. Laid out in the 19th century, it features a large open green area in the centre with trees to its west, and it contains twelve statues of statesmen and other notable individuals.

As well as being one of London&#x27;s main tourist attractions, it is also the place where many demonstrations and protests have been held. The square is overlooked by various official buildings: legislature to the east (in the Houses of Parliament), governmental executive offices to the north (on Whitehall), the judiciary to the west (the Supreme Court), and the church to the south (with Westminster Abbey).

Parliament Square features all of the British flags, the flags of the United Kingdom, its four countries, the county flags and the three flags of the Crown Dependencies and the sixteen heraldic shields of the British Overseas Territories. 

== Location ==
Buildings looking upon the square include the churches Westminster Abbey and St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, the Middlesex Guildhall which is the seat of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Government Offices Great George Street serving HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs, and Portcullis House.

Roads that branch off the Parliament Square are St Margaret Street (towards Millbank), Broad Sanctuary (towards Victoria Street), Great George Street (towards Birdcage Walk), Parliament Street (leading into Whitehall) and Bridge Street (leading onto Westminster Bridge).

== History ==


=== Original layout ===
Parliament Square was laid out in 1868 in order to open up the space around the Palace of Westminster and improve traffic flow, and featured London&#x27;s first traffic signals. A substantial amount of property had to be cleared from the site. The architect responsible was Sir Charles Barry. Its original features included the Buxton Memorial Fountain, which was removed in 1949 and placed in its present position in nearby Victoria Tower Gardens in 1957.

In 1949, the design for the replanning of the Parliament Square area, Westminster, London was carried out by the architect, George Grey Wornum (1888–1957)

=== Post Second World War changes ===
The plans to redesign the Square predated the Second World War as the Ministry of Transport suggested:

that a larger central island was necessary to allow traffic more room in Great George Street. If the northern side of the central island were lengthened it was expected that the frequent traffic blocks at the junction of Parliament Street and Bridge Street with Parliament Square would be greatly reduced.

Following the war, London County Council submitted a revised plan that was agreed by the Ministry of Transport and legislated for by Parliament with the Parliament Square (Improvements) Act 1949.The Act was required due to the mixed ownership of the land. The redesign included putting new roads, pavement and gardens in the area.

As St George Street was widened and an existing road was moved, the Buxton Memorial Fountain had to be removed. Because Victorian style architecture was unpopular at the time, some in Parliament argued it should never be re-erected: at least one parliamentarian said it had &quot;no artistic merit whatever&quot; The Act provided that the fountain could be removed, but required its re-erection.

The central garden of the square was transferred from the Parliamentary Estate to the control of the Greater London Authority by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. It has responsibility to light, cleanse, water, pave, and repair the garden, and has powers to make bylaws for the garden.

== Public demonstrations ==
The east side of the square, lying opposite one of the main entrances to the Palace of Westminster, has historically been a common site of protest against government action or inaction. On May Day 2000 the square was transformed into a giant allotment by a Reclaim the Streets guerrilla gardening action. Most recently, Brian Haw staged a continual protest there for several years, campaigning against British and American action in Iraq. Starting on 2 June 2001, Haw left his post only once, on 10 May 2004 – and then because he had been arrested on the charge of failing to leave the area during a security alert – and returned the following day when he was released. The alleged disruption caused by Haw&#x27;s protest led Parliament to insert a clause into the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 making it illegal to protest in Parliament Square (or, indeed, in a large area reaching roughly half a mile in all directions) without first seeking the permission of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.

The provisions of that Act relating to Parliament Square were repealed by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which provides for a different regime of &quot;prohibited activities&quot;.

As well as sparking a great deal of protest from various groups on the grounds of infringement of civil liberties including the European Convention on Human Rights, the Act was initially unsuccessful in accomplishing its goals: Brian Haw was held to be exempt from needing authorisation in a High Court ruling, as his protest had started before the Act came into effect (though any new protests would be covered); Haw remained in Parliament Square. Later, the Court of Appeal overturned this ruling, forcing Haw to apply for police authorisation to continue his protest.

==Statues==

The square is home to twelve statues of British, Commonwealth, and Anglosphere political figures. They are listed here in anti-clockwise order, beginning with Winston Churchill&#x27;s statue, which faces Parliament.
==Demonstrations==
The Parliament Square Peace Campaign was a peace campaign started by Brian Haw in 2001 and carried on by Barbara Tucker until 2013.

In May 2010, a peace camp known as Democracy Village was set up on the square to protest (initially) against the British government&#x27;s involvement in invasions in the Middle East, which became an eclectic movement encompassing left-wing causes and anti-globalisation protests.

The Mayor of London Boris Johnson appealed to the courts to have them removed and, after demonstrators lost an appeal in July 2010, Lord Neuberger ruled that the protesters camping on the square should be evicted. The final tents were removed in January 2012.

<text>Otis Worldwide Corporation (branded as the Otis Elevator Company its former legal name) styled as OTIS is an American company that develops, manufactures and markets 
elevators, escalators, moving walkways, and related equipment.

Based in Farmington, Connecticut, U.S., Otis is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of vertical transportation systems, principally focusing on elevators, escalators, and moving walkways. The company pioneered the development of the &quot;safety elevator&quot;, invented by Elisha Otis in 1852, which used a special mechanism that locked the elevator car in place against hoisting rope failure.

The Otis Elevator Company was acquired by United Technologies in 1976, but it was spun off as an independent company 44 years later in April 2020 as Otis Worldwide Corporation.

Its slogan is &quot;Made to move you&quot;.

== History ==

=== The booming elevator market ===
In 1852, Elisha Otis invented the safety elevator, which was automatically halted in a hoisting rope failure. After a demonstration at the 1853 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the elevator industry established credibility. 

Otis founded the Otis Elevator Company in Yonkers, New York, in 1853. When he died in 1861 his sons Charles and Norton formed a partnership and continued the business. During the American Civil War, Otis elevators were in high demand throughout the United States due to the shipment of war materials. In 1864, with the partnership of J.M. Alvord, the company became known as Otis Brothers &amp; Co. In 1867, Otis opened a factory in Yonkers.

In 1925, the world&#x27;s first fully automatic elevator, Collective Control, was introduced. In 1931, the company installed the world&#x27;s first double-deck elevator at 70 Pine Street in New York City.

In the early 1950s, the company introduced &quot;Autotronic&quot;, an electromechanical computer system for running a bank of high speed elevator cars, which could predict the traffic flows within a building at specific times of the day and deploy the cars efficiently. 

Otis opened a factory in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1965.

1977 saw the introduction of &quot;Elevonic&quot; - the successor to Autotronic - which was the first solid state, digital microprocessor-based elevator control system.

=== 1980s changes ===
Otis was acquired by United Technologies in 1976 and became a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1981, the Yonkers factory closed, and was later purchased by Kawasaki for use as a rail car assembly plant. Also in 1981, Otis signed a business agreement with an elevator company in China.

During the 1980s, Otis developed the Remote Elevator Monitoring (REM) system that collected behavioral data from 300,000 elevators.

Otis has also dabbled in horizontal automated people-mover &quot;shuttle&quot; systems, such as the Otis Hovair. In 2020, Otis formed a joint venture called &quot;Poma-Otis Transportation Systems&quot; with the French company Pomagalski to promote these products. That partnership has since ended.

=== 1990s acquisitions ===
Otis Elevator Company purchased Evans Lifts in the UK when Evans Lifts Ltd went bankrupt in 1997 during its merge with Express Lift Company with the name ExpressEvans. It was the oldest and largest manufacturer of lift equipment in the UK, and was based in Leicester, England. Otis&#x27;s Customer Care Centre is still based in the old Evans Lifts building in Leicester. The building has since been extended by Otis. There are some installations of Evans Lifts in use today. Few lifts made by Otis are branded as Evans. Notably, an original Evans Lift is still in the Silver Arcade in Leicester. It formerly transported people to the upper floors. The upper floors are no longer occupied: the lift is no longer used.

In 1999, Otis acquired CemcoLift, Inc, located in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. The operation was later closed in October 2012, with the remaining business being sold to Minnesota Elevator Inc.

=== South Korea divisions ===
In 1910, Otis installed the first hydraulic elevator for transporting money at the Bank of Chosun, and installed the first elevator for passengers on the Korean Peninsula at a railway hotel. Since then, almost all elevators in the Korean Peninsula have been installed before the liberation, and even after liberation, they were the first to land in the Korean market, occupying about 80% of the elevators imported from Korea.

In 1982, it re-entered the Korean market through a technological alliance with Dongyang Elevator, and in 1991 took over the elevator manufacturer Korea Engineering and launched &#x27;Korea OTIS Elevator&#x27;. The elevators supplied at this time were brought to Korea in the form of direct imports from overseas factories.

At the time, apart from OTIS Korea, the actual predecessor of Otis Elevator was LG Industrial Systems Elevator. In 1968, Youngjin Electric and Goldstar established elevator manufacturing plants in Juan, Incheon and Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do, respectively. After forming an alliance, Hitachi Elevator entered the Korean market in 1979 through a joint venture with Goldstar. At that time, the Juan plant had the name &#x27;Shin Yeong Electric&#x27; and the Changwon plant had the name &#x27;Geumseong Sa&#x27;, but in 1987, Geumseong Sa changed its name to &#x27;Geumseong Sanjeon&#x27; and Shin Yeong Electric&#x27;s changed its name to &#x27;Geumseong Sanjeon&#x27;, which combined the Geumseong Electrician and Geumseong Sanjeon. It was called &#x27;Goldstar Elevator&#x27;. In February 1995, Goldstar Industrial Systems changed its name to &#x27;LG Industrial Systems&#x27;, and in September of the same year, LG Industrial Systems merged Goldstar Industrial Systems and Geumseong Industrial Systems(Korea). Afterwards, Otis established &#x27;Otis Korea&#x27; in a joint venture with Dongyang Heavy Industries in February 1998.

Otis also took over the shares of LG Industrial Systems Elevator in December 1999 and changed the name of LG Industrial Systems Elevator to LG-OTIS. At the same time, the existing Korea OTIS was merged with it. In 2000, LG-OTIS founded Sigma Elevator and used Sigma brand to replace LG-OTIS,LG and Goldstar Brand at Overseas (International). The company name was also changed back to OTIS-LG. After the acquisition of shares was completed in 2005, LG Industrial Systems was separated into LS Industrial Systems and the &#x27;LG&#x27; trade name was removed to become &#x27;Otis Elevator Korea&#x27;.

=== 21st century ===
In 2011, Otis acquired its competitor Marshall Elevator for an undisclosed amount. Beginning in 2011, Otis cut its manufacturing operations in Nogales, Mexico, and supply-chain operations in Tucson, as part of a consolidation of manufacturing operations in Florence, South Carolina, where Otis purchased a former Maytag facility on 92 acres. As part of the consolidation, Otis shut down its Bloomington facility in 2012.

In October 2013, Otis won its biggest ever contract to date, to supply 670 elevators and escalators to the Hyderabad Metro. Its second biggest contract had been in 2012, to supply 349 elevators for the Hangzhou metro. In 2015, Otis had to slow its expansion in Asia after orders in the region started to drop.

In January 2018, Otis Elevator Korea was recognized by &quot;Elevator World&quot; with its &quot;New Construction Project of the Year&quot; for the company&#x27;s installation of the world&#x27;s longest double-deck elevator (30 elevators) in the 555-meter Lotte World Tower in Seoul. The &quot;sky shuttle&quot; can take 54 passengers from the 2nd floor to the 121st floor in 1 minute. On November 26, 2018, United Technologies announced it would spin off Otis Elevator into an independent company. Its headquarters are to remain in Connecticut. In 2019, Otis geared up its artificial intelligence technology by capitalizing on predictive technologies.

In July 2022, Otis elevator company sold its business in Russia to S8 Capital holding. The holding received equipment, technologies and staff. In addition, the American side guaranteed uninterrupted supplies of the necessary spare parts. In early August, a new production line was launched. Since the end of January 2023, the company has been manufacturing products there under the Meteor Lift brand.

==Incidents &amp; controversies==

In 1992, an Otis trainee died on the job due to orders to violate workplace safety protocols. OEEU organised protests in response, forcing the company to permanently take on 98 temporary workers and to stop their recruitment for permanent jobs. This had been a problem for several years at that point.

In 1998, two Otis workers died on the job in separate incidents in Mumbai, India. This led to a public discussion about the lack of safety training for contract workers at the company and an investigation by the Lokshahi Hakk Sanghatana Maharashtra, a democratic rights organization, which demanded that company management should be prosecuted for their negligence.

In 2001, due to a dated design flaw, 8-year-old Tucker Smith from Bel Air, Maryland was crushed to death by an Otis Elevator after becoming trapped in the gap between the outside door and the inside gate.

On August 14, 2002, Neil Raymond Ricco tripped while exiting an Otis Elevator while working at a Comerica Bank building in San Diego. He said it malfunctioned, causing the elevator to stop a foot below the floor level. Ricco was diagnosed with a concussion and a controversial investigation ensued.

In February 2007, European Union regulators fined Otis Elevator €225 million (US$295.8 million) for being part of a price-fixing cartel in the Belgian, Dutch, Luxembourg, and German markets. Competitors ThyssenKrupp, Schindler Group, KONE, and Mitsubishi Elevator Europe were also fined for participating in the same cartel.

On July 24, 2009, a group of eight people were trapped for eight hours in an Otis elevator in Toronto. A repair man who tried to fix the elevator fell 10 floors to his death.

On December 14, 2010, an Otis escalator installed in the International Trade station of Shenzhen Metro Line 1 reversed direction without notice, triggering a stampede that injured 25 passengers.

On July 5, 2011, an Otis 513MPE escalator installed at Beijing Subway Line 4 Zoo Station changed direction without notice, causing 30 people to fall. One boy was killed and 27 people injured, prompting China to halt the use of the escalator model. A Beijing official said the 513MPE escalator had &quot;defects in design, manufacturing and maintenance&quot;, and that Otis had &quot;unavoidable responsibility for the accident&quot;. Shenzhen Metro authorities confirmed that the cause of the accident was also similar to the Shenzhen accident on December 14.

In March 2017, eighteen people suffered injuries at Hong Kong&#x27;s Langham Place shopping mall when an escalator maintained by Otis reversed direction from up to down.

On July 9, 2018, a one-year-old Otis escalator at Stockholm City Station changed direction from up to a rapid descent, in what local officials called a &quot;free fall&quot;, causing minor injuries. Inspection of the gear boxes of several Otis escalators revealed unexpected rust and heavy wear. This led to the newly built train stations Stockholm City Station and Stockholm Odenplan being temporarily closed on July 13, 2018, for security reasons until the problems were understood and resolved.

<text>São Vicente (after Saint Vincent of Saragossa, the patron Saint of Lisbon, Portugal) is a coastal municipality in southern São Paulo, Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of the Baixada Santista. The population is 329,911 (2022 est.) in an area of .

Founded in 1532, by the Portuguese explorer and colonial administrator Martim Afonso de Sousa, it is the first permanent village (colonial settlement) established in Brazil, and the first election on the American continent also took place there. Because of this, it is considered the &quot;cradle of American democracy&quot;.

São Vicente is one of the 15 municipalities in São Paulo considered seaside resorts by the state of São Paulo, as they meet certain prerequisites defined by State Law. This status guaranteed the municipality a larger budget from the State to promote regional tourism. Furthermore, the municipality acquires the right to add, next to its name, the title of &quot;Estância Balneária&quot; (Balneary Resort), a term by which it is designated both by official municipal records and by state references. Historical tourism and beach tourism are among the most relevant sectors of its economy.

==History==
It was the first permanent Portuguese settlement in the Americas and the first capital of the Captaincy of São Vicente, roughly the present state of São Paulo. Established as a proper village in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa on what was then the Porto dos Escravos (&quot;Port of the Slaves&quot;), operated by three Portuguese colonists who trafficked on slaves captured by allied tribes, São Vicente is titled &quot;Cellula Mater&quot; (Mother Cell) of Brazil for being the first organized town in the country. The first City Council of all the Americas was democratically elected and established in São Vicente on August 22, 1532.

A battle took place here on 3 February 1583 when three English warships attempting to trade with the Portuguese, was set upon by three Spanish galleons. The Spanish ships were repelled and retreated leaving one galleon sunk.

==Geography==
São Vicente is located on the western half of coastal São Vicente Island, being mostly a bedroom community for the larger and wealthier neighbouring port and commercial city of Santos on the island&#x27;s eastern half. A small north–south hill range separates for the most part the two cities&#x27; urban areas, but they are contiguous in the north and on a narrow beach strip in the south. A narrow strip of land of the basin of the small Cubatão River extends west out of the central area of São Vicente, north and parallel to the municipality of Praia Grande.

São Vicente Suspension Bridge, linking the island to Praia Grande on the mainland, was constructed in 1914; a second link, the Mar Pequeno Bridge, was opened in 1981. São Vicente is linked to the capital city of São Paulo by the Imigrantes Highway and to the southern coast by the Manuel da Nóbrega Highway. São Vicente has a small fishing industry in its portion on the mainland, where there are a few small settlements.

==Noted places==
The Monument of 500 years of Brazil (&quot;Monumento dos 500 anos do Brasil&quot;) is a viewing platform on Porchat Island, an islet which extends from the south of São Vicente Island. The platform was designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907–2012). It faces roughly north in an imaginary line to the National Congress in Brasília, completed by Niemeyer and others in 1960.
The municipality contains part of the Xixová-Japuí State Park, created in 1993.

==Population history==
==Transport==
The Baixada Santista region is connected to Greater São Paulo by highway through the Anchieta-Imigrantes System. The Imigrantes Highway reaches the municipality, crossing the urban island area and heading towards Praia Grande by crossing the Canal dos Barreiros via the Ponte do Mar Pequeno. Towards the South Coast, starting from the Imigrantes Highway, there is the Padre Manoel da Nóbrega Highway, which crosses the entire continental portion of the municipality between Serra do Mar and the Samaritá plain. The municipality is crossed from east to west on the island and on the continental part by the lines of América Latina Logística - ALL (former network of Ferrovia Paulista - FEPASA), which, heading west, connects São Vicente with Praia Grande, Mongaguá, Itanhaém and Peruíbe; heading east with Santos and heading north, it reaches the Planalto Paulistano, to the south of Greater São Paulo, in Embu-Guaçu.

The Suspension Bridge was built in 1914 and was designed by engineer Saturnino de Brito, who at the time applied German sewage drainage technology to the Itaipu Bridge. Today, it connects the island of São Vicente to the mainland, providing access to the municipality of Praia Grande, and is also one of the city&#x27;s main tourist attractions due to its beauty.

==Media==
In telecommunications, the city was served by the Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="650605" wikidata="Q309482" url="?curid=650605" title="Naum Gabo">
<text>Naum Gabo (born Naum Neemia Pevsner; Russian: Наум Борисович Певзнер; Hebrew: נחום נחמיה פבזנר) (23 August 1977) was an influential sculptor, theorist, and key figure in Russia&#x27;s post-Revolution avant-garde and the subsequent development of twentieth-century sculpture. His work combined geometric abstraction with a dynamic organization of form in small reliefs and constructions, monumental public sculpture and pioneering kinetic works that assimilated new materials such as nylon, wire, lucite and semi-transparent materials, glass and metal. Responding to the scientific and political revolutions of his age, Gabo led an eventful and peripatetic life, moving to Berlin, Paris, Oslo, Moscow, London, and finally the United States, and within the circles of the major avant-garde movements of the day, including Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, the Bauhaus, de Stijl and the Abstraction-Création group. Two preoccupations, unique to Gabo, were his interest in representing negative space—&quot;released from any closed volume&quot; or mass—and time. He famously explored the former idea in his &quot;Linear Construction&quot; works (1942-1971)—used nylon filament to create voids or interior spaces as &quot;concrete&quot; as the elements of solid mass—and the latter in his pioneering work, &quot;Kinetic Sculpture (Standing Waves)&quot; (1920), often considered the first kinetic work of art.

Gabo elaborated many of his ideas in the Constructivist &quot;Realistic Manifesto&quot;, which he issued with his brother, sculptor Antoine Pevsner as a handbill accompanying their 1920 open-air exhibition in Moscow. In it, he sought to move past Cubism and Futurism, renouncing what he saw as the static, decorative use of color, line, volume and solid mass in favor of a new element he called &quot;the kinetic rhythms (…) the basic forms of our perception of real time.&quot; Gabo held a utopian belief in the power of sculpture—specifically abstract, Constructivist sculpture—to express human experience and spirituality in tune with modernity, social progress, and advances in science and technology. After working on a smaller scale in England during the war years (1936-1946), Gabo moved to the United States, where he received several public sculpture commissions, only some of which he completed. These include &quot;Constructie&quot;, a commemorative monument in front of the Bijenkorf Department Store (1954, unveiled in 1957) in Rotterdam, and &quot;Revolving Torsion&quot;, a large fountain outside St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London. The Tate Gallery, in Millbank, London, held a major retrospective of Gabo&#x27;s work in 1966 and holds many key works in its collection, as do the Museum of Modern Art and Guggenheim Museum in New York. Work by Gabo is also included at Rockefeller Center in New York City and The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, New York, US.

==Early life and education==
Gabo grew up in a Jewish family of six children in the provincial Russian town of Bryansk, where his father, Boris (Berko) Pevsner, worked as an engineer. Gabo&#x27;s older brother was the fellow Constructivist artist Antoine Pevsner, leading Gabo to change his name to avoid any confusion. He was fluent in German, French, and English, in addition to his native Russian. The command of several languages contributed greatly to Gabo&#x27;s mobility throughout his career.

In 1910, after schooling in Kursk, Gabo entered Munich University to study medicine. He then switched to natural science, as well as having attended art history lectures by the historian Heinrich Wölfflin. In 1912, Gabo transferred to an engineering school in Munich, where he discovered abstract art and met the noted painter Wassily Kandinsky. A year later, Gabo moved to Paris to join Antoine, who was already established as a painter. Engineering training was key to the development of Gabo&#x27;s sculptural work that often integrated machined elements. During this time, he was highly acclaimed by many critics and won awards such as the Logan Medal of the Arts (1954) and the A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts (1959).

==Constructivism==

After the outbreak of war, Gabo moved first to Copenhagen then Oslo with his older brother Alexei, making his first constructions under the name Naum Gabo in 1915. These earliest constructions originally in cardboard or wood were figurative such as the &quot;Head No.2&quot; in the Tate collection. He moved back to Russia in 1917, to become involved in politics and art, spending five years in Moscow with his brother Antoine.

Gabo contributed to the Agit-prop open air exhibitions and taught at &#x27;VKhUTEMAS&#x27; the Higher Art and Technical Workshop, with Tatlin, Kandinsky and Rodchenko. During this period the reliefs and construction became more geometric and Gabo began to experiment with kinetic sculpture though the majority of the work was lost or destroyed. Gabo&#x27;s designs had become increasingly monumental but there was little opportunity to apply them; as he commented, &quot;It was the height of civil war, hunger and disorder in Russia. To find any part of machinery … was next to impossible&quot;. Gabo wrote and issued jointly with Antoine Pevsner in August 1920 a &quot;Realistic Manifesto&quot; proclaiming the tenets of pure Constructivism – the first time that the term was used. In the manifesto Gabo criticized Cubism and Futurism as not becoming fully abstract arts and stated that the spiritual experience was the root of artistic production. Gabo and Pevsner promoted the manifesto by staging an exhibition on a bandstand on Tverskoy Boulevard in Moscow and posted the manifesto on hoardings around the city.

In Germany Gabo came into contact with the artists of the de Stijl and taught at the Bauhaus in 1928. During this period he realised a design for a fountain in Dresden (since destroyed). Gabo and Antoine Pevsner had a joint exhibition at the Galerie Percier, Paris in 1924 and the pair designed the set and costumes for Diaghilev&#x27;s ballet &quot;La Chatte&quot; (1926) for the Ballets Russes that toured in Paris and London. To escape the rise of the Nazis in Germany the pair stayed in Paris in 1932–35 as members of the Abstraction-Creation group with Piet Mondrian.

Gabo visited London in 1935, and settled in 1936, where he found a &quot;spirit of optimism and sympathy for his position as an abstract artist&quot;. At the outbreak of World War II he followed his friends Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson to St Ives in Cornwall, where he stayed initially with the art critic Adrian Stokes and his wife Margaret Mellis. While in Cornwall he continued to work, albeit on a smaller scale. His influence was important to the development of modernism within St Ives, and it can be seen most conspicuously in the paintings and constructions of John Wells and Peter Lanyon, both of whom developed a softer more pastoral form of Constructivism.

In 1946, Gabo and his wife and daughter emigrated to Connecticut in the United States, where they resided first in Woodbury, and later in Middlebury. Gabo died in Waterbury, in 1977 and his wife in 1993.

==Gabo&#x27;s theory of art==

The essence of Gabo&#x27;s art was the exploration of space, which he believed could be done without having to depict mass. His earliest constructions such as &quot;Head No.2&quot; were formal experiments in depicting the volume of a figure without carrying its mass. Gabo&#x27;s other concern as described in the &quot;Realistic Manifesto&quot; was that art needed to exist actively in four dimensions including time.

Gabo&#x27;s formative years were in Munich, where he was inspired by and actively participated in the artistic, scientific, and philosophical debates of the early years of the 20th century. Because of his involvement in these intellectual debates, Gabo became a leading figure in Moscow’s avant garde, in post-Revolution Russia. It was in Munich that Gabo attended the lectures of art historian Heinrich Wölfflin and gained knowledge of the ideas of Einstein and his fellow innovators of scientific theory, as well as the philosopher Henri Bergson. As a student of medicine, natural science and engineering, his understanding of the order present in the natural world mystically links all creation in the universe. Just before the onset of the First World War in 1914, Gabo discovered contemporary art, by reading Kandinsky’s &quot;Concerning the Spiritual in Art&quot;, which asserted the principles of abstract art.

Gabo’s vision is imaginative and passionate. Over the years his exhibitions have generated immense enthusiasm because of the emotional power present in his sculpture. Gabo described himself as &quot;making images to communicate my feelings of the world.&quot; In his work, Gabo used time and space as construction elements and in them solid matter unfolds and becomes beautifully surreal and otherworldly. His sculptures initiate a connection between what is tangible and intangible, between what is simplistic in its reality and the unlimited possibilities of intuitive imagination. Imaginative as Gabo was, his practicality lent itself to the conception and production of his works. He devised systems of construction which were not only used for his elegantly elaborate sculptures but were viable for architecture as well. He was also innovative in his works, using a wide variety of materials including the earliest plastics, fishing line, bronze, sheets of Perspex, and boulders. He sometimes even used motors to move the sculpture.

Caroline Collier, an authority on Gabo’s work, said, &quot;The real stuff of Gabo’s art is not his physical materials, but his perception of space, time and movement. In the calmness at the ‘still centre’ of even his smallest works, we sense the vastness of space, the enormity of his conception, time as continuous growth.&quot; In fact, the element of movement in Gabo’s sculpture is connected to a strong rhythm, more implicit and deeper than the chaotic patterns of life itself. The exactness of form leads the viewer to imagine journeying into, through, over and around his sculptures.

Gabo wrote his &quot;Realistic Manifesto&quot;, in which he ascribed his philosophy for his constructive art and his joy at the opportunities opened up by the Russian Revolution. Gabo saw the Revolution as the beginning of a renewal of human values. Five thousand copies of the manifesto tract were displayed in Moscow streets in 1920.

Gabo had lived through a revolution and two world wars; he was also Jewish and had fled Nazi Germany. Gabo’s acute awareness of turmoil sought out solace in the peacefulness that was so fully realized in his “ideal” art forms. It was in his sculpture that he evaded all the chaos, violence, and despair he had survived. Gabo chose to look past all that was dark in his life, creating sculptures that though fragile are balanced so as to give us a sense of the constructions delicately holding turmoil at bay.

==Printmaking==
Gabo began printmaking in 1950, when he was persuaded to try out the medium by William Ivins, a former curator of prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, New York. His first print was a wood engraving in a section of wood taken from a piece of furniture and printed onto a piece of toilet paper. He went on to produce a significant and varied body of graphic work, including much more elaborate and lyrical compositions, until his death in 1977.

Rejecting the traditional notion that prints should be made in editions of identical impressions, Gabo instead preferred to use the monoprint format as a vehicle for artistic experimentation.

==Art conservation challenges==
Gabo pioneered the use of plastics, such as cellulose acetate, in his sculptures. The Tate Gallery in London, which has the world&#x27;s largest collection of his early works, is battling their chemical degradation. They have commissioned replicas of some sculptures to preserve a visual record of their appearances.

<doc id="650612" wikidata="Q694404" url="?curid=650612" title="Klagenfurt Airport">
<text>Klagenfurt Airport ( ) is a primary international airport near Klagenfurt, the sixth-largest city in Austria. It is located in the borough of Annabichl, north-north-east of the city centre.

==History==
===Early years===
In 1905, Georg Count of Khevenhüller from Hochosterwitz Castle and in 1907 Dipl.-Ing. Joseph Sablatnig (Joseph Sablatnig was owner of the Fokker-Sablatnig, Deutsche Flugzeuge, Deutsche Motoren, Flugzeug Gesellschaft mbH, Berlin) were the first men in the sky over Carinthia and Klagenfurt.

In World War I and II, the airport of Klagenfurt was operated as a military airfield, and indeed Klagenfurt Airport was founded in 1914 as a military airport. The civil opening of Klagenfurt Airport on 17 May 1925, was an event for the City of Klagenfurt as well as for Carinthia. In June 1929, the pilot hero of World War I, Julius Fedrigoni Edler von Etschthal, has the function of flight director of the airport until 1939. After the end of World War II, Julius Fedrigoni was returned to Annabichl, he worked with low-budget flight operations. On 1 January 1952, Korv. Kpt. Julius Fedrigoni founded the Committee city of Klagenfurt and he was flight director until 1956.

From 1926 to 1938, seven airlines operated from Klagenfurt Airport. Countries like Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia and of course domestic flights to all major cities in Austria were connected with Klagenfurt.

===Decrease of operations===
In the spring of 2014, the airport&#x27;s home carrier, Austrian Airlines, announced the closure of their ticketing and service counters at Klagenfurt Airport due to decreasing demand. Services were instead to be provided directly at the check-in counters. In April 2015, Austrian Airlines also announced that a closure of their domestic route to Vienna was under consideration within the next few years based on economic reasons. In the same year, the state government announced plans to partly sell its stakes in the airport to private investors.

As the airport suffered from a major decrease of passenger numbers in recent years, it was suggested by the management to establish major logistics and cargo operators here, which might be supported by the freight shipment operations handled at the relatively closely located harbours of the Adriatic Sea. The airport already features road and rail connections. However, Austrian Airlines stated later that the airport would not work for cargo operations due to noise complaints and the night curfew.

In October 2015, the Austrian Air Force announced it would end all operations and close its helicopter base at Klagenfurt Airport by the end of 2015.

===Developments since 2020===
In August 2020, Ryanair announced plans to leave the airport and terminate their route to Palma de Mallorca Airport, which had been operated as a wetlease by Lauda. However, Ryanair returned with four destinations in 2023.

In 2022, the airport&#x27;s then majority owner, &quot;Lilihill Group&quot;, announced the creation of a new regional airline based in Klagenfurt, &quot;Liliair&quot;. With a proposed launch in April 2023, the carrier was supposed to expand the airport&#x27;s connection with major European destinations. However the announced flights were not open for booking for any date on or before the day of the launch and no operating carrier had been confirmed. Previously there was ongoing controversy between Lilihill and the state of Carinthia, which proposed to buy back the airport, leaving the &quot;Liliair&quot; project in doubt. In April 2023, Lilihill Group announced that a Liliair home base in Klagenfurt has become unlikely due to the ongoing dispute. In May 2023, the city of Klagenfurt and the state of Carinthia announced it would execute a buy-back option and re-acquired majority ownership of the airport after longstanding debate.

==Facilities==
Klagenfurt Airport consists of one small passenger terminal building which features some shops and restaurants as well as a visitors terrace. The apron provides several stands for mid-sized planes such as the Airbus A320 as well as smaller general aviation aircraft. As there are no jet bridges, buses are used for boarding.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines offer year-round and seasonal scheduled and charter flights at Klagenfurt Airport:


The nearest larger international airport is Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport in Slovenia, approximately to the south.

==Statistics==

==Ground transportation==
===Train===
The train station &quot;Klagenfurt-Annabichl&quot; is a 5–10 minutes (750 meters) walk from the terminal and offers suburban rail services every half-hour to St.Veit (and beyond), to Klagenfurt main station, to the villages along Lake Wörthersee, and to Villach (and beyond).

===Road===
The airport has its own exit named &quot;Klagenfurt Flughafen&quot; on the nearby motorway A2, which leads to Vienna and Italy. A regular suburban bus service connects the airport with the city centre including the Klagenfurt central station. There is also a coach connection between Klagenfurt Airport and Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport, which is served several times a day.

<doc id="650615" wikidata="Q794126" url="?curid=650615" title="Aztec Code">
<text>The Aztec Code is a matrix code invented by Andrew Longacre, Jr. and Robert Hussey in 1995. The code was published by AIM, Inc. in 1997. Although the Aztec Code was patented, that patent was officially made public domain. The Aztec Code is also published as ISO/IEC 24778:2024 standard. Named after the resemblance of the central finder pattern to an Aztec pyramid, Aztec Code has the potential to use less space than other matrix barcodes because it does not require a surrounding blank &quot;quiet zone&quot;.

== Structure ==
The symbol is built on a square grid with a bull&#x27;s-eye pattern at its centre for locating the code. Data is encoded in concentric square rings around the bull&#x27;s-eye pattern. The central bull&#x27;s-eye is 9×9 or 13×13 pixels, and one row of pixels around that encodes basic coding parameters, producing a &quot;core&quot; of 11×11 or 15×15 squares. Data is added in &quot;layers&quot;, each one containing two rings of pixels, giving total sizes of 15×15, 19×19, 23×23, etc.

The corners of the core include orientation marks, allowing the code to be read if rotated or reflected. Decoding begins at the corner with three black pixels, and proceeds clockwise to the corners with two, one, and zero black pixels. The variable pixels in the central core encode the size, so it is not necessary to mark the boundary of the code with a blank &quot;quiet zone&quot;, although some barcode readers require one.

The compact Aztec code core may be surrounded by 1 to 4 layers, producing symbols from 15×15 (room for 13 digits or 12 letters) through 27×27. There is additionally a special 11×11 &quot;rune&quot; that encodes one byte of information. The full core supports up to 32 layers, 151×151 pixels, which can encode 3832 digits, 3067 letters, or 1914 bytes of data.

Whatever part of the symbol is not used for the basic data is used for Reed–Solomon error correction, and the split is completely configurable, between limits of 1 data word, and 3 check words. The recommended number of check words is 23% of symbol capacity plus 3 codewords.

Aztec Code is supposed to produce readable codes with various printer technologies. It is also well suited for displays of cell phones and other mobile devices.

== Encoding ==
The encoding process consists of the following steps:
# Converting the source message to a string of bits
# Computing the necessary symbol size and mode message, which determines the Reed–Solomon codeword size
# Bit-stuffing the message into Reed–Solomon codewords
# Padding the message to a codeword boundary
# Appending check codewords
# Arranging the complete message in a spiral around the core

All conversion between bits strings and other forms is performed according to the big-endian (most significant bit first) convention.

=== Character set ===
All 8-bit values can be encoded, plus two escape codes:
* FNC1, an escape symbol used to mark the presence of an application identifier, in the same way as in the GS1-128 standard.
* ECI, an escape followed by a 6-digit Extended Channel Interpretation code, which specifies the character set used to interpret the following bytes.

By default, codes 0–127 are interpreted according to ANSI X3.4 (ASCII), and 128–255 are interpreted according to ISO/IEC 8859-1: Latin Alphabet No. 1. This corresponds to ECI 000003.

Bytes are translated into 4- and 5-bit codes, based on a current decoding mode, with shift and latch codes for changing modes. Byte values not available this way may be encoded using a general &quot;binary shift&quot; code, which is followed by a length and a number of 8-bit codes.

For changing modes, a &quot;shift&quot; affects only the interpretation of the single following code, while a &quot;latch&quot; affects all following codes. Most modes use 5-bit codes, but Digit mode uses 4-bit codes.
* Initial mode is &quot;Upper&quot;
* x/S = Shift to mode x for one character; B/S = shift to 8-bit binary
* x/L = Latch to mode x for following characters
* Punct codes 2–5 encode two bytes each
* The table lists ASCII characters, but it is the byte values that are encoded, even if a non-ASCII character set is in use

B/S (binary shift) is followed by a 5-bit length. If non-zero, this indicates that 1–31 8-bit bytes follow. If zero, 11 additional length bits encode the number of following bytes less 31. (Note that for 32–62 bytes, two 5-bit byte shift sequences are more compact than one 11-bit.) At the end of the binary sequence, the previous mode is resumed.

FLG(&quot;n&quot;) is followed by a 3-bit &quot;n&quot; value. &quot;n&quot;=0 encodes FNC1. &quot;n&quot;=1–6 is followed by 1–6 digits (in digit mode) which are zero-padded to make a 6-bit ECI identifier. &quot;n&quot;=7 is reserved and currently illegal.

=== Mode message ===
The mode message encodes the number of layers (&quot;L&quot; layers encoded as the integer &quot;L&quot;−1), and the number of data codewords (&quot;D&quot; codewords, encoded as the integer &quot;D&quot;−1) in the message. All remaining codewords are used as check codewords.

For compact Aztec codes, the number of layers is encoded as a 2-bit value, and the number of data codewords as a 6-bit value, resulting in an 8-bit mode word. For full Aztec codes, the number of layers is encoded in 5 bits, and the number of data codewords is encoded in 11 bits, making a 16-bit mode word.

The mode word is broken into two or four 4-bit codewords in GF(16), and 5 or 6 Reed–Solomon check words are appended, making a 28- or 40-bit mode message, which is wrapped in a 1-pixel layer around the core. Thus a (15,10) or (15,9) Reed-Solomon code (shortened to (7,2) or (10,4) respectively), over GF(16) is used.

Because an L+1-layer compact Aztec code can hold more data than an L-layer full code, full codes with less than 4 layers are rarely used.

Most importantly, the number of layers determines the size of the Reed–Solomon codewords used. This varies from 6 to 12 bits:

The codeword size &quot;b&quot; is the smallest even number which ensures that the total number of codewords in the symbol is less than the limit of 2&quot;b&quot;−1 which can be corrected by a Reed–Solomon code.

As mentioned above, it is recommended that at least 23% of the available codewords, plus 3, are reserved for correction, and a symbol size is chosen such that the message will fit into the available space.

=== Bit stuffing ===
The data bits are broken into codewords, with the first bit corresponding to the most significant coefficient. While doing this, code words of all-zero and all-ones are avoided by bit stuffing: if the first &quot;b&quot;−1 bits of a code word have the same value, an extra bit with the complementary value is inserted into the data stream. This insertion takes place whether or not the last bit of the code word would have had the same value or not.

Also, note that this only applies to strings of &quot;b&quot;−1 bits &quot;at the beginning of a code word&quot;. Longer strings of identical bits are permitted as long as they straddle a code word boundary.

When decoding, a code word of all zero or all one may be assumed to be an erasure, and corrected more efficiently than a general error.

This process makes the message longer, and the final number of data codewords recorded in the mode message is not known until it is complete. In rare cases, it may be necessary to jump to the next-largest symbol and begin the process all over again to maintain the minimum fraction of check words.

=== Padding ===
After bit stuffing, the data string is padded to the next codeword boundary by appending 1 bit. If this would result in a code word of all ones, the last bit is changed to zero (and will be ignored by the decoder as a bit-stuffing bit). On decoding, the padding bits may be decoded as shift and latch codes, but that will not affect the message content. The reader must accept and ignore a partial code at the end of the message, as long as it is all-ones.

Additionally, if the total number of data bits available in the symbol is not a multiple of the codeword size, the data string is prefixed with an appropriate number of 0 bits to occupy the extra space. These bits are not included in the check word computation.

=== Check codewords ===
Both the mode word, and the data, must have check words appended to fill out the available space. This is computed by appending &quot;K&quot; check words such that the entire message is a multiple of the Reed–Solomon polynomial (&quot;x&quot;−2)(&quot;x&quot;−4)...(&quot;x&quot;−2&quot;K&quot;).

Note that check words are &quot;not&quot; subject to bit stuffing, and may be all-zero or all-one. Thus, it is not possible to detect the erasure of a check word.

=== Laying out the message ===

A full Aztec code symbol has, in addition to the core, a &quot;reference grid&quot; of alternating black and white pixels occupying every 16th row and column. A compact Aztec code does not contain this grid. These known pixels allow a reader to maintain alignment with the pixel grid over large symbols. For up to 4 layers (31×31 pixels), this consists only of single lines extending outward from the core, continuing the alternating pattern. Inside the 5th layer, however, additional rows and columns of alternating pixels are inserted ±16 pixels from the center, so the 5th layer is located ±17 and ±18 pixels from the center, and a 5-layer symbol is 37×37 pixels.

Likewise, additional reference grid rows and columns are inserted ±32 pixels from the center, making a 12-layer symbol 67×67 pixels. In this case, the 12th layer occupies rings ±31 and ±33 pixels from the center. The pattern continues indefinitely outward, with 15-pixel blocks of data separated by rows and columns of the reference grid.

One way to construct the symbol is to delete the reference grid entirely and begin with a 14×14-pixel core centered on a 2×2 pixel-white square. Then break it into 15×15 pixel blocks and insert the reference grid between them.

The mode message begins at the top-left corner of the core and wraps around it clockwise in a 1-bit thick layer. It begins with the most significant bit of the number of layers and ends with the check words. For a compact Aztec code, it is broken into four 7-bit pieces to leave room for the orientation marks. For a full Aztec code, it is broken into four 10-bit pieces, and those pieces are each divided in half by the reference grid.

In some cases, the total capacity of the matrix does not divide evenly by full code words. In such cases, the main message is padded with 0 bits in the beginning. These bits are not included in the check word calculation and should be skipped during decoding. The total matrix capacity for a full symbol can be calculated as (112+16*L)*L for a full Aztec code and (88+16*L)*L for a compact Aztec code, where L is the symbol size in layers. As an example, the total matrix capacity of a compact Aztec code with 1 layer is 104 bits. Since code words are six bits, this gives 17 code words and two extra bits. Two zero bits are prepended to the message as padding and must be skipped during decoding.

The padded main message begins at the outer top-left of the entire symbol and spirals around it &quot;counterclockwise&quot; in a 2-bit thick layer, ending directly above the top-left corner of the core. This places the bit-stuffed data words, for which erasures can be detected, in the outermost layers of the symbol, which are most prone to erasures. The check words are stored closer to the core. The last check word ends just above the top left corner of the bull&#x27;s eye.

With the core in its standard orientation, the first bit of the first data word is placed in the upper-left corner, with additional bits placed in a 2-bit-wide column left-to-right and top-to-bottom. This continues until 2 rows from the bottom of the symbol when the pattern rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and continues in a 2-bit high row, bottom-to-top and left-to-right. After 4 equal-sized quarter layers, the spiral continues with the top-left corner of the next-inner layer, finally ending one pixel above the top-left corner of the core.

Finally, 1 bit are printed as black squares, and 0 bits are printed as white squares.

== Usage ==
=== Transport ===
Aztec codes are widely used for transport ticketing.

The Aztec Code has been selected by the airline industry (IATA&#x27;s BCBP standard) for electronic boarding passes. Several airlines send Aztec Codes to passengers&#x27; mobile phones to act as boarding passes. These are often integrated with apps on passengers&#x27; phones, including Apple Wallet.

Aztec codes are also used in rail, including by Tehran Metro, British National Rail, Eurostar, Deutsche Bahn, TCDD Taşımacılık, DSB, SJ, České dráhy, Slovak Railways, Slovenian Railways, Croatian Railways, Trenitalia, Nederlandse Spoorwegen, Pasažieru vilciens, PKP Intercity, VR Group, Via Rail, Swiss Federal Railways, SNCB and SNCF for tickets sold online and printed out by customers or displayed on mobile phone screens. The Aztec code is scanned by a handheld scanner by on-train staff or at the turnstile to validate the ticket.

=== Governmental ===
Car registration documents in Poland bear a summary, compressed by NRV2E algorithm, encoded as Aztec Code. Works are underway to enable car insurance companies to automatically fill in the relevant information based on digital photographs of the document as the first step of closing a new insurance contract.

Federal Tax Service in Russia encodes payment information in tax notices as Aztec Code.

=== Commercial ===
Many bills in Canada are now using this technology as well, including EastLink, Shaw Cable, and Bell Aliant.

<doc id="650618" wikidata="Q721096" url="?curid=650618" title="Denmark Vesey">
<text>Denmark Vesey (also Telemaque) (July 2, 1822) was a free Black man and community leader in Charleston, South Carolina, who was accused and convicted of planning a major slave revolt in 1822. Although the alleged plot was discovered before it could be realized, its potential scale stoked the fears of the antebellum planter class that led to increased restrictions on both enslaved and free African Americans.

Likely born into slavery in St. Thomas, Vesey was enslaved by Captain Joseph Vesey in Bermuda for some time before being brought to Charleston. There, Vesey won a lottery and purchased his freedom around the age of 32. He had a good business and a family but was unable to buy his first wife, Beck, and their children out of slavery. Vesey worked as a carpenter and became active in the Second Presbyterian Church. In 1818, he helped found an independent African Methodist Episcopal (AME) congregation in the city, today known as Mother Emanuel. The congregation began with the support of white clergy and, with over 1,848 members, rapidly became the second-largest AME congregation in the nation.

His insurrection, which was to take place on Bastille Day, 14 July 1822, became known to thousands of blacks throughout Charleston, South Carolina, and along the Carolina coast. The plot called for Vesey and his group of enslaved people and free blacks to execute their enslavers and temporarily liberate the city of Charleston. Vesey and his followers planned to sail to Haiti to escape retaliation. Two enslaved men opposed to Vesey&#x27;s scheme leaked the plot. Charleston authorities charged 131 men with conspiracy. In total, 67 men were convicted and 35 hanged, including Denmark Vesey. Historian Douglas Egerton suggested that Vesey could be of Coromantee (an Akan-speaking people) origin, based on remembrance by a free black carpenter who knew Vesey toward the end of his life.

==Early life==
Manuscript transcripts of testimony at the 1822 court proceedings in Charleston, South Carolina, and its report after the events constitute the chief documentation source about Denmark Vesey&#x27;s life. The court judged Vesey guilty of conspiring to launch a slave rebellion and executed him by hanging.

The court reported that he was born into slavery about 1767 in St. Thomas, at the time a colony of Denmark. Captain Joseph Vesey renamed him Telemaque; historian Douglas Egerton suggests that Vesey could have been of Coromantee (an Akan-speaking people) origin. Biographer David Robertson also suggests that Telemaque may have been of Mandé origin.

Telemaque was purchased at around the age of 14 by Joseph Vesey, a Bermudian sea captain and slave merchant. Little is known of the life of Joseph Vesey, though the Vesey family is one of some influence in Bermuda, more recently producing notable businessmen and politicians including master mariner Captain Nathaniel Arthur Vesey (1841–1911; MCP for Devonshire Parish), and his sons, Sir Nathaniel Henry Peniston Vesey, CBE (known as Henry Vesey; 1901–1996, MCP for Smith&#x27;s Parish) and John Ernest Peniston Vesey, CBE (1903–1993), MP for Southampton Parish, and grandson Ernest Winthrop Peniston Vesey (1926–1994). After a time, Vesey sold the youth to a planter in French Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti). When the youth was found to suffer epileptic fits, Captain Vesey took him back and returned his purchase price to the former master. Biographer Egerton found no evidence of Denmark Vesey having epilepsy later in life, and he suggests that Denmark may have faked the seizures to escape the particularly brutal conditions on Saint-Domingue.

Telemaque worked as a personal assistant for Joseph Vesey and served Vesey as an interpreter in slave trading, a job which required him to travel to Bermuda (an archipelago on the same latitude as Charleston, South Carolina, but nearest to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and originally settled as part of colonial Virginia by the Virginia Company) for extended periods; as a result, he was fluent in French and Spanish as well as English. Following the Revolutionary War, the captain retired from his nautical career (including slave trading), settling in Charleston, South Carolina, which had been settled from Bermuda in 1669. In 1696, Captain Vesey wed Mary Clodner, a wealthy &quot;free East Indian woman&quot;, and the couple used Telemaque as a domestic at Mary&#x27;s plantation, The Grove, just outside Charleston on the Ashley River.

==Freedom==
On November 9, 1799, Telemaque won $1500 (~$ in ) in a city lottery. At the age of 32, he bought his freedom for $600 () from Vesey. He took the surname Vesey and the given name of &#x27;Denmark&#x27; after the nation ruling his birthplace of St. Thomas. Denmark Vesey began working as an independent carpenter and built up his own business. By this time, he had married Beck, an enslaved woman. Their children were born into slavery under the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem,&quot; by which children of an enslaved mother took her status. Vesey worked to gain freedom for his family; he tried to buy his wife and their children, but her master would not sell her. This meant their future children would also be born into slavery.

Along with other slaves, Vesey had belonged to the Second Presbyterian church and chafed against its restrictions on Black members.

In 1818, after becoming a freedman, he was among the founders of a congregation on what was known as the &quot;Bethel circuit&quot; of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church). This had been organized in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1816 as the first independent black denomination in the United States.

The AME Church in Charleston was supported by leading white clergy. In 1818, white authorities briefly ordered the church closed for violating slave code rules that prohibited black congregations from holding worship services after sunset. The church attracted 1,848 members by 1818, making it the second-largest AME church in the nation. City officials always worried about slaves in groups; they closed the church again for a time in 1821, as the City Council warned that its classes were becoming a &quot;school for slaves&quot; (under the slave code, slaves were prohibited from being taught to read). Vesey was reported as a leader in the congregation, drawing from the Bible to inspire hope for freedom.

==Background==
By 1708, a majority of South Carolinians were enslaved, reflecting the numerous enslaved Africans imported to the state as laborers on the rice and indigo plantations. Exports of these commodity crops and cotton from the offshore Sea Islands produced the wealth South Carolina&#x27;s planters enjoyed. This elite class controlled the legislature for decades after the American Revolution. The state, the Lowcountry, and the city of Charleston had a majority of the population who were enslaved Africans. By the late 18th century, slaves were increasingly &quot;country born,&quot; native to the United States. They were generally considered more tractable than newly enslaved Africans. Connections of kinship and personal relations extended between slaves in the city of Charleston and those on plantations in the Lowcountry, just as those connections existed among the planter class, many of whom had residences (and domestic slaves) in both places.

From 1791 to 1803, the Haitian Revolution of enslaved and free people of color on Saint-Domingue embroiled the French colony in violence; Black people gained independence and created the republic of Haiti in 1804. Many whites and free people of color had fled to Charleston and other port cities as refugees during the uprisings and brought the people they enslaved with them. In the city, the new slaves were referred to as &quot;French Negroes&quot;. Their accounts of the revolts and their success spread rapidly among enslaved Charlestonians. The free people of color occupied a place between the mass of Black people and the minority of whites in Charleston.

In the early 1800s, the state legislature had voted to reopen its ports to import slaves from Africa. This decision was highly controversial and opposed by many planters in the Lowcountry, who feared the disruptive influence of new Africans on the people they enslaved. Planters in Upland areas were developing new plantations based on short-staple cotton and needed many workers, so the state approved the resumption of the Atlantic trade. The profitability of this type of cotton had been made possible by the invention of the cotton gin just before the turn of the 19th century. From 1804 to 1808, Charleston merchants imported some 75,000 slaves, more than the total brought to South Carolina in the 75 years before the Revolution. Some of these slaves were sold to the Uplands and other areas, but many of the new Africans were held in Charleston and on nearby Lowcountry plantations.

==Planning==

Even after gaining his freedom, Vesey continued to identify and socialize with many slaves. He became increasingly set on helping his new friends break from the bonds of slavery. In 1819, Vesey became inspired by the congressional debates over the status of the Missouri Territory and how it should be admitted to the United States since slavery appeared to be under attack.

Vesey developed followers among the mostly enslaved Black people in the Second Presbyterian Church and then the independent AME African Church. The latter&#x27;s congregation represented more than 10% of the Black people in the city. They resented the harassment by city officials. Economic conditions in the Charleston area became difficult since an economic decline affected the city. In 1821, Vesey and a few slaves began to conspire and plan a revolt. For the revolt to be successful, Vesey had to recruit others and strengthen his army. Because Denmark Vesey was a lay preacher, when he had recruited enough followers, he would review plans of the revolt with his followers at his home during religious classes. Vesey inspired slaves by connecting their potential freedom to the biblical story of the Exodus, God&#x27;s delivery of the children of Israel from Egyptian slavery.

In his 50s, Vesey was a well-established carpenter with his own business. He reportedly planned the insurrection on Bastille Day, July 14, 1822. This date was notable in association with the French Revolution, whose victors had abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue. News of the plan was said to be spread among thousands of Black people throughout Charleston and for tens of miles through plantations along the Carolina coast. (Both the city and county populations were majority black; Charleston in 1820 had a population of 14,127 Black people and 10,653 white people.) Within the black population was a growing upper class of free people of color or mulattos, some of whom were slave-holders.

Vesey held numerous secret meetings and eventually gained the support of both enslaved and free Black people throughout the city and countryside who were willing to fight for their freedom. He was said to have organized thousands of slaves who pledged to participate in his planned insurrection. By using intimate family ties between those in the countryside and the city, Vesey created an extensive network of supporters.

His plan was first to make a coordinated attack on the Charleston Meeting Street Arsenal. Once they secured these weapons, these Freedom Fighters planned to commandeer ships from the harbor and sail to Haiti, possibly with Haitian help. Vesey and his followers also planned to kill white slave-owners throughout the city, as had been done in Haiti, and liberate the slaves. According to records of the French Consulate in Charleston, his group was reported to have numerous members who were &quot;French Negroes,&quot; slaves brought from Saint-Domingue by refugee slave-holders.

==Failed uprising==
Due to the vast number of slaves who knew about the planned uprising, Vesey feared that word of the plot would get out. Vesey reportedly advanced the date of the insurrection to June 16. Beginning in May, two slaves opposed to Vesey&#x27;s scheme, George Wilson and Joe LaRoche, gave the first specific testimony about a coming uprising to Charleston officials, saying a &quot;rising&quot; was planned for July 14. George Wilson was a mixed-race slave intensely loyal to his master. The testimonies of these two men confirmed an earlier report coming from another slave named Peter Prioleau. Though officials didn&#x27;t believe the less specific testimony of Prioleau, they did believe Wilson and LaRoche due to their unimpeachable reputations with their masters. With their testimony, the city launched a search for conspirators.

Joe LaRoche originally planned to support the rising and brought the slave Rolla Bennett to discuss plans with his close friend George Wilson. Wilson had to decide whether to join the conspiracy described by Bennett or tell his master that there was a plot in the making. Wilson refused to join the conspiracy and urged both Laroche and Bennett to end their involvement in the plans. Wilson convinced LaRoche that they must tell his master to prevent the conspiracy from being acted out.

The Mayor James Hamilton was told, and he organized a citizens&#x27; militia, putting the city on alert. White militias and groups of armed men patrolled the streets daily for weeks until many suspects were arrested by the end of June, including 55-year-old Denmark Vesey. As suspects were arrested, they were held in the Charleston Workhouse until the newly appointed Court of Magistrates and Freeholders heard evidence against them. The Workhouse was also the place where punishment was applied to slaves for their masters and likely where Plot suspects were abused or threatened with abuse or death before giving testimony to the Court. The suspects were allowed visits by ministers; Dr. Benjamin Palmer visited Vesey after he was sentenced to death, and Vesey told the minister that he would die for a &quot;glorious cause&quot;.

==Court of Magistrates and Freeholders==
As leading suspects were rounded up by the militia ordered by Intendant/Mayor James Hamilton, the Charleston City Council voted to authorize a Court of Magistrates and Freeholders to evaluate suspects and determine crimes. Tensions in the city were high, and many residents had doubts about actions taken during the widespread fears and quick rush to judgment. Soon after the Court began its sessions, in secret and promising secrecy to all witnesses, Supreme Court Justice William Johnson published an article in the local paper recounting an incident of a feared insurrection of 1811. He noted that a slave was mistakenly executed in the case, hoping to suggest caution in the Vesey affair. He was well respected, having been appointed Justice by President Thomas Jefferson in 1804. Still, his article appeared to produce a defensive reaction, with white residents defending the Court and the militancy of city forces.

From June 17, the day after the purported insurrection was to begin, to June 28, the day after the court adjourned, officials arrested 31 suspects and in more significant numbers as the month went on. The Court took secret testimony about suspects in custody and accepted evidence against men not yet charged. Historians acknowledge that some witnesses testified under threat of death or torture, but Robertson believes that their affirming accounts appeared to provide details of a plan for rebellion.

Newspapers were nearly silent while the Court conducted its proceedings. While bickering with Johnson, the Court first published its judgment of the guilt of Denmark Vesey and five enslaved Black people, sentencing them to death. The six men were executed by hanging on July 2. None of the six had confessed, and each proclaimed his innocence to the end. Their deaths quieted some of the city residents&#x27; fears, and the tumult in Charleston about the planned revolt began to die down. Officials made no arrests in the next three days as if wrapping up their business.

===Concerns about proceedings===
Learning that the proceedings were largely conducted in secret, with defendants often unable to confront their accusers or hear testimony against them, Governor Thomas Bennett, Jr., had concerns about the legality of the Court, as did his brother-in-law Justice Johnson. The slave-holders of accused slaves and their attorneys, however, were allowed to attend the proceedings. Bennett had served almost continuously in the state legislature since 1804, including four years as Speaker of the House. He did not take any action at first because four people that he enslaved were among those accused in the first group with Vesey, and three of these men were executed with the leader on July 2.

Bennett consulted in writing with Robert Y. Hayne, Attorney General for the state, expressing his concerns about the conduct of the Court. He believed that it was wrong for defendants to be unable to confront their accusers yet be subject to execution. Hayne responded that, under the state&#x27;s constitution, slaves were not protected by the rights available to freemen of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and the Magna Carta. Vesey, however, was a free man.

===Further arrests and convictions===
On July 1, an editorial in the &quot;Courier&quot; defended the work of the Court. After that, in July, the cycle of arrests and judgments sped up, and the pool of suspects greatly expanded. As noted by historian Michael P. Johnson, most Black people were arrested and charged after the first group of hangings on July 2; this was after the actions of the Court had been criticized by both Justice William Johnson and Governor Bennett. The Court recorded that they divided the suspects into groups: one was those who &quot;exhibited energy and activity&quot;; if convicted, these were executed. Other men who seemed to &quot;yield their acquiescence&quot; to participating were deported if convicted. For five weeks, the Court ordered the arrest of a total of 131 black men, charging them with conspiracy.

In July, the pace of arrests and charges more than doubled, as if authorities were intent on proving a large insurrection needed controlling. But, the court &quot;found it difficult to get conclusive evidence.&quot; It noted in its report covering the second round of court proceedings that three men sentenced to death implicated &quot;scores of others&quot; when they were promised leniency in punishment.

In total, the courts convicted 67 men of conspiracy and hanged 35, including Vesey, in July 1822. Thirty-one men were deported, 27 were reviewed and acquitted, and 38 were questioned and released.

===Vesey&#x27;s family===
Vesey had at least one child, Denmark Vesey, Jr., who remained in Charleston. He later married Hannah Nelson. The remainder of Vesey&#x27;s family was also affected by the crisis and Court proceedings. His enslaved son Sandy Vesey was arrested, judged to have been part of the conspiracy, and included among those deported from the country, probably to Cuba. Vesey&#x27;s third wife, Susan, later emigrated to Liberia, which the American Colonization Society had established as a colony for formerly enslaved Americans and other free Black people. Two other sons, Randolph Vesey and Robert Vesey, both children of Beck, Denmark&#x27;s first wife, survived past the end of the American Civil War and were emancipated. Robert helped rebuild Charleston&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1865 and also attended the transfer of power when US officials retook control of Fort Sumter.

===White involvement===
On October 7, 1822, Judge Elihu Bay convicted four white men for a misdemeanor in inciting slaves to insurrection during the Denmark Vesey slave conspiracy. These four white men were William Allen, John Igneshias, Andrew S. Rhodes, and Jacob Danders. The men were sentenced to varied fines and reasonably short jail time. Historians have found no evidence that any of these men were known abolitionists; they do not seem to have had contact with each other or any of the plotters of the rebellion. William Allen received twelve months in prison and a $1,000 fine, the harshest punishment of the four. When tried in court, Allen admitted to trying to help the slave conspiracy but said that he did so because he was promised a large sum of money for his services. Reports from the judge show that the court believed that Allen was motivated by greed rather than sympathy for the slaves.

The other white conspirators&#x27; punishments were far more lenient than Allen&#x27;s. John Igneshias was sentenced to a one hundred dollar fine and three months in prison, as was Jacob Danders. Igneshias was found guilty of inciting slaves to insurrection, but Danders was charged for saying that he &quot;disliked everything in Charleston, but the Negroes and the sailors.&quot; Danders had said this publicly after the plot had been revealed; city officials thought his comment suspicious. Danders was found guilty of showing sympathy to the slaves who had been caught ostensibly as part of the conspiracy. The final white defendant, Andrew S. Rhodes, received a sentence of six months and a five hundred dollar fine; there was less evidence against him than any of the other whites.

White residents of Charleston feared there could be more whites who wanted to help Black people fight against slavery. They were already concerned about the growing abolitionist movement in the North, which spread its message through the mail and via antislavery mariners, both white and black, who came ashore in the city. Judge Bay sentenced the four white men as a warning to any other whites who might think of supporting slave rebels. He also pushed state lawmakers to strengthen laws against both mariners and free Black people in South Carolina in general and anyone supporting slave rebellions in particular. Judge Bay thought these four white men were spared from hanging only because of a &quot;statutory oversight.&quot; The convictions of these men enabled some white men of the pro-slavery establishment to believe that the people they enslaved would not stage rebellions without the manipulation of &quot;alien agitators or local free people of color.&quot;

==Aftermath==
In August, Governor Bennett and Mayor Hamilton published accounts of the insurrection and Court proceedings. Bennett downplayed the danger posed by the alleged crisis and argued that the Court&#x27;s executions and lack of due process damaged the state&#x27;s reputation. But Hamilton captured the public with his 46-page account, which became the &quot;received version&quot; of a narrowly avoided bloodbath and citizens saved by the city&#x27;s and Court&#x27;s zeal and actions. Hamilton attributed the insurrection to the influence of black Christianity and the AME African Church, an increase in slave literacy, and misguided paternalism by slave-holders toward slaves. In October, the Court issued its Report, shaped by Hamilton.

Lacy K. Ford notes that:
the most important fact about the Report was (and remains) that it tells the story that Hamilton and the Court wanted told. It shaped the public perception of events, and it was certainly intended to do just that. As such, it makes important points about the Vesey Court&#x27;s agenda, regardless of the larger historical truth of the document&#x27;s claims about the alleged insurrection and accused insurrectionists.Ford noted that Hamilton and the Court left a significant gap in their conclusions about the reasons for the slave revolt. The importation of thousands of enslaved Africans to the city and region by the early 1800s was completely missing as a factor. However, fears of slave revolt had been a significant reason for opposition to the imports. He suggests this factor was omitted because that political battle was over; instead, Hamilton identified reasons for the rising that could be prevented or controlled by legislation which he proposed.

Governor Bennett&#x27;s criticism continued, and he made a separate report to the legislature in the fall of 1822 (he was in his last year in office). He accused the Charleston City Council of usurping its authority by setting up the court, which he said violated the law by holding secret proceedings without protection for the defendants. The court took testimony under &quot;pledges of inviolable secrecy&quot; and &quot;convicted [the accused] and &quot;sentenced [them] to death without their seeing the persons, or hearing the voices of those, who testified to their guilt.&quot; Open sessions could have allowed the court to distinguish among varying accounts.

Believing that &quot;black religion&quot; contributed to the uprising and believing that several AME Church officials had participated in the plot, Charleston officials ordered the large congregation to be dispersed and the building razed. Church trustees sold the lumber, hoping to rebuild in later years. Rev. Morris Brown of the church was forced out of the state; he later became a bishop of the national AME Church. No independent black church was established in the city again until after the Civil War, but many black worshippers met secretly. In the 21st century, the congregations of Emanuel AME Church and the Morris Brown AME Church carry on the legacy of the first AME Church in Charleston.

In 1820, the state legislature had already restricted manumissions by requiring that both houses approve any act of manumission (for an individual only). This discouraged slave-holders from freeing the people they enslaved and made it almost impossible for slaves to gain freedom independently, even in cases where an individual or family member could pay a purchase price. After the Vesey Plot, the legislature further restricted the movement of free Black people and free people of color; if one left the state for any reason, that person could not return. In addition, it required each free black to have documented white &quot;guardians&quot; to vouch for their character.

The legislature also passed the Negro Seamen Act in 1822, requiring free black sailors on ships that docked in Charleston to be imprisoned in the city jail for the period that their ships were in port. This was to prevent them from interacting with and influencing slaves and other Black people in the city. This act was ruled unconstitutional in federal court, as it violated international treaties with the United Kingdom. The state&#x27;s right to imprison free black sailors became one of the issues in the confrontation between South Carolina and the federal government over states&#x27; rights.

Following the passage of the Seaman&#x27;s Act, the white minority of Charleston organized the South Carolina Association, which was essentially to take over enforcement in the city of control of enslaved and free Black people. In late 1822, the City petitioned the General Assembly &quot;to establish a competent force to act as a municipal guard for the protection of the City of Charleston and its vicinity.&quot; The General Assembly agreed and appropriated funds to erect &quot;suitable buildings for an Arsenal, for the deposit of the arms of the State, and a Guard House, and for the use of the municipal guard&quot; or militia. The South Carolina State Arsenal, which became known as the Citadel, was completed in 1829, when white fears of insurrection had subsided for a time. Rather than establish the municipal guard authorized in the act, the State and city agreed with the US War Department to garrison the Citadel from those soldiers stationed at Fort Moultrie.

==Historical debate==
The Court published its report in 1822 as &quot;An Official Report of the Trials of Sundry Negroes ...&quot; This was the first full account, as newspaper coverage had been very restricted during the secret proceedings. In particular, the Court collected all the information available on Vesey in the last two weeks of his life and eight weeks following his hanging. Their Report has been the basis of historians&#x27; interpretations of Vesey&#x27;s life and the rebellion. Since the mid-20th century, most historians have evaluated the conspiracy in terms of black resistance to slavery, with some focusing on the plot, others on the character of Vesey and his senior leaders, and others on the black unity displayed. Despite the threats from whites, few enslaved Black people confessed, and few provided testimony against the leaders or each other. Philip D. Morgan notes that by keeping silent, these slaves resisted the whites and were the true heroes of the crisis.

In 1964, historian Richard Wade examined the Court&#x27;s report compared to manuscript transcripts of the court proceedings, of which two versions exist. Based on numerous discrepancies he found and the lack of material evidence at the time of the &quot;trials,&quot; he suggested that the Vesey Conspiracy was mostly &quot;angry talk&quot; and that the plot was not well founded for action. He noted how little evidence was found for such a plot: no arms caches were discovered, no firm date appeared to have been set, and no well-organized underground apparatus was found, but both Black and white people widely believed there was a well-developed insurrection in the works. Claiming, erroneously, that both Justice William Johnson and his brother-in-law Governor Thomas Bennett Jr. had strong doubts about the existence of a conspiracy, Wade concluded that among black and white Charleston residents, there were &quot;strong grievances on one side and deep fears on the other,&quot; creating a basis for belief in a broad rebellion. Wade&#x27;s conclusion that the conspiracy was not well-formed was criticized later by William Freehling and other historians, particularly as Wade was found to have overlooked some material.

In 2001, Michael P. Johnson criticized three histories of Vesey and the conspiracy that was published in 1999. Based on his study of the primary documents, he suggested that historians had overinterpreted the evidence gathered at the end of Vesey&#x27;s life from the testimony of witnesses under tremendous pressure in court. He said historians too wholeheartedly accepted such witness testimony as fact and noted specific &quot;interpretive improvisations.&quot; For instance, historians have described Vesey&#x27;s physical appearance, which was not documented in the court record. However, the free black carpenter Thomas Brown, who occasionally worked with Vesey, described him as a &quot;large, stout man.&quot; In response to Johnson&#x27;s work, Philip D. Morgan notes that in the 19th century, Vesey was once described as a mulatto or free person of color by William Gilmore Simms, who however, never had met Vesey and incorrectly placed him in Haiti during the 1791 revolt. Trial records, moreover, identified him as a free &quot;black&quot; man. Some historians from 1849 to the 1990s described him as a mulatto. The free black carpenter Thomas Brown, who knew and sometimes worked with Vesey, described him as having dark skin. Lacking substantial documentation to refute Thomas Brown&#x27;s recollections, since the later 20th century historians have described him as black. Despite Brown&#x27;s recollections, however, Philip Morgan suggests this transformation in ancestry represents modern sensibilities more than any evidence.

Johnson found that the two versions of the court manuscript transcripts disagreed and contained material not in the court&#x27;s official report. He concluded that the report was an attempt by the Court to suggest that formal trials had been held since the proceedings had not followed accepted procedures for trials and due process. Their proceedings had been held secretly, and some defendants could not confront their accusers. After Vesey and the first five conspirators were executed, the Court approved the arrest of another 82 suspects in July, more than twice as many as had been arrested in June. Johnson suggested that, after public criticism, the Court was motivated to prove there was a conspiracy.

Morgan notes that two prominent men indicated concerns about the Court. In addition, he notes that Bertram Wyatt-Brown in his &quot;Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South&quot; (p. 402) said that prosecutions of slave revolts were typically so arbitrary that they should be considered a &quot;communal rite&quot; and &quot;celebration of white solidarity.&quot; &quot;a religious more than a normal criminal process.&quot; Morgan thinks that historians have too often ignored that warning and supports Johnson&#x27;s close examination of the variations among the Vesey court records.

Wade and Johnson suggest that Mayor James Hamilton, Jr., of Charleston may have exaggerated rumors of the conspiracy to use as a &quot;political wedge issue&quot; against moderate Governor Thomas Bennett Jr. in their rivalry and efforts to attract white political support. Hamilton knew that four people that Bennett enslaved had been arrested as suspects; three men were executed on July 2 together with Vesey. Mayor Hamilton supported a militant approach to controlling slaves. He believed that the paternalistic approach of improving the treatment of slaves, as promoted by moderate slave-holders such as Bennett, was a mistake. He used the crisis to appeal to the legislature for laws, which he had already supported, to authorize restrictions on enslaved and free Black people.

Hamilton&#x27;s article and the Court Report examine various reasons for the planned revolt. Extremely dependent on slavery, many Charleston residents had been alarmed about the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which restricted slavery from expansion to the western territories, and they felt that it threatened the future of slavery. Some local people suggested that slaves had learned about the compromise and thought they were to be emancipated. Whites blamed the AME Church, they blamed rising slave literacy, and the African slaves brought from Haiti during the Haitian Revolution. In 1822, beleaguered whites in Charleston uniformly believed that Black people had planned a large insurrection; such a scenario represented their worst fears.

Wade noted the lack of material evidence: no arms caches or documents related to the rebellion. Johnson&#x27;s article provoked considerable controversy among historians. &quot;The William and Mary Quarterly&quot; invited contributions to a &quot;Forum&quot; on the issue, published in January 2002. Egerton noted that the free Black carpenter Thomas Brown and other Black people familiar with Vesey or the Reverend Morris Brown, the leader of the AME Church, continued to speak or write about Vesey&#x27;s plot in later years, supporting conclusions that it did exist. In 2004, historian Robert Tinkler, a biographer of Mayor Hamilton, reported that he found no evidence to support Johnson&#x27;s theory that Hamilton conjured the plot for political gain. Hamilton ruthlessly pursued the prosecution, Tinkler concluded, because he &quot;believed there was indeed a Vesey plot.&quot; Ford noted that Hamilton presented those aspects of and reasons for the insurrection that enabled him to gain control of slavery, which he had wanted before the crisis.

In a 2011 article, James O&#x27;Neil Spady said that by Johnson&#x27;s criteria, the statements of witnesses George Wilson and Joe LaRoche should be considered credible and evidence of a developed plot for the rising. Neither slave was coerced nor imprisoned when he testified. Each volunteered his testimony early in the investigation, and LaRoche risked making statements that the court could have construed as self-incriminating. Spady concluded that a group had been about to launch the &quot;rising&quot; (as they called it) when their plans were revealed. Perhaps it was of a smaller scale than in some accounts, but he believed men were ready to take action.

In 2012, Lacy K. Ford gave the keynote address to the South Carolina Historical Association; his subject was an interpretation of the Vesey Plot. He said, &quot;The balance of the evidence clearly points to the exaggeration of the plot and the misappropriation of its lessons by Hamilton, the Court, and their allies for their own political advantage.&quot; Charleston officials had a crisis in which not one white person had been killed or injured. Ford contrasted their actions to the approach of Virginia officials after the 1831 Nat Turner&#x27;s Slave Rebellion, in which slaves killed tens of whites. Charleston officials said the &quot;brilliant&quot; Vesey led a large, complex, and sophisticated conspiracy; but Virginia officials downplayed Turner&#x27;s revolt, stressing that he and his few followers acted alone. Ford concludes,
Enlarging the threat posed by Vesey allowed the Lowcountry white elite to disband the thriving
AME church in Charleston and launch a full-fledged, if ultimately unsuccessful, counter-attack against the insurgency. The local elite&#x27;s interpretation of the Vesey scare prepared the state for politics centered on the defense of slavery. The agenda reinforced tendencies toward consensus latent in the Palmetto state&#x27;s body politic; tendencies easily mobilized for radicalism by perceived threats against slavery.

==Legacy and honors==
* The Denmark Vesey House in Charleston, although almost certainly not the historic home of Vesey, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 by the Department of Interior.
* In 1976, the city of Charleston commissioned a portrait of Vesey. It was hung in the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, but was controversial.
* From the 1990s, African-American activists in Charleston proposed erecting a memorial to Denmark Vesey to honor his effort to overturn slavery in the city. The proposal was controversial because many white residents did not want to memorialize a man whom they considered a terrorist. Others believed that in addition to acknowledging his leadership, a memorial would also express the slave&#x27;s struggles for freedom. By 2014 the demographics of the city and nation had changed and white objections were no longer considered important. The Denmark Vesey Monument, representing Vesey as a carpenter and holding a Bible, was erected in Hampton Park, at some distance from the main tourist areas.
* During the 2020 NFL season, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins wore a decal on his helmet with Vesey&#x27;s name.

==In popular culture ==

Literature
* The title character in Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; (1855) is an escaped slave and religious zealot who aids fellow slave refugees and spends most of the novel plotting a slave rebellion. He is a composite of Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner.
* Martin Delany&#x27;s serialized novel, &quot;Blake; or the Huts of America&quot; (1859–61), referred to Vesey and Nat Turner, as well as having a protagonist who plans a large-scale slave insurrection.
* Denmark Vesey is the name and basis for a character in Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot;, an alternate history series of books set in the United States, which have been published from 1987 to 2014.
* Sue Monk Kidd&#x27;s 2014 novel, &quot;The Invention of Wings,&quot; includes Denmark Vesey as a character; the slave revolt and its reaction are major plot points. The novel perpetuates the myths that Vesey practiced polygamy and that he was hanged alone from a large tree in Charleston.
* Denmark Vesey is spoken about in John Jakes&#x27; historical novel &quot;Charleston&quot; (2002).

Theatre
* Dorothy Heyward&#x27;s drama &quot;Set My People Free&quot; (1948) refers to Vesey&#x27;s life.

Radio
* Vesey&#x27;s life is retold in the 1948 radio drama &quot;The Denmark Vesey Story&quot;, presented by &quot;Destination Freedom&quot;, written by Richard Durham
* The same script was retooled for &quot;The CBS Radio Workshop&quot;, retitled &quot;Sweet Cherries in Charleston&quot; and with some dialogue changes. Broadcast August 25, 1957, it tells the story of the aborted 1822 rebellion.

Television
* Vesey was the subject of the 1982 made-for-television drama &quot;A House Divided: Denmark Vesey&#x27;s Rebellion&quot;, in which he was played by actor Yaphet Kotto.
* Several PBS documentaries have included material on Denmark Vesey, particularly &quot;Africans in America&quot; and &quot;This Far By Faith&quot;.
* Vesey was portrayed by Carl Lumbly in the 1991 television film Brother Future. Vesey&#x27;s planned uprising plays a crucial role in the film&#x27;s plot.

Music
* Vesey was the subject of a 1939 opera named after him by novelist and composer Paul Bowles.
* Joe McPhee&#x27;s composition &quot;Message from Denmark&quot;, featured on the 1971 album &quot;Joe McPhee &amp; Survival Unit II at WBAI&#x27;s Free Music Store&quot;, refers not to the country, but to Vesey.

<doc id="650623" wikidata="Q162913" url="?curid=650623" title="MaxiCode">
<text>MaxiCode is a public domain, machine-readable symbol system originally created by the United Parcel Service (UPS) in 1992. Suitable for tracking and managing the shipment of packages, it resembles an Aztec Code or QR code, but uses dots arranged in a hexagonal grid instead of square grid. MaxiCode has been standardised under ISO/IEC 16023.

A MaxiCode symbol (internally called &quot;Bird&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, &quot;dense code&quot;, or &quot;UPS code&quot;) appears as a 1-inch square, with a bullseye in the middle, surrounded by a pattern of hexagonal dots. It can store about 93 characters of information, and up to 8 MaxiCode symbols can be chained together to convey more data. The centered symmetrical bullseye is useful in automatic symbol location regardless of orientation, and it allows MaxiCode symbols to be scanned even on a package traveling rapidly.

==Structured Carrier Message==

MaxiCode symbols using modes 2 and 3 include a &quot;Structured Carrier Message&quot; containing key information about a package. This information is protected with a strong Reed–Solomon error correction code, allowing it to be read even if a portion of the symbol is damaged. These fields include:

# A 4-bit indication of the mode in use, currently either mode 2 or mode 3.
# A national or international postal code. MaxiCode supports both numeric postal codes (e.g. a ZIP Code), and alphanumeric postal codes.
# A 3-digit country code encoded per ISO 3166
# A 3-digit class of service code assigned by the carrier

The structured portion of the message is stored in the inner area of the symbol, near the bull&#x27;s-eye pattern. (In modes that do not include a structured portion, the inner area simply stores the beginning of the message.)

==Application-specific information==
Irrespective of mode, a variable amount of application-specific information can be encoded in a MaxiCode symbol. This format of this additional data is not strictly defined, and amongst other information may include:

* Purchase order number
* Customer reference
* Invoice number
* Tracking number
* Indicator of the originating carrier

==Modes==
* Mode 0 – Obsolete mode superseded by modes 2 and 3. (Older printers will produce Mode 0 if the firmware is outdated. Mode 0 MaxiCodes can be visually determined by examining the two horizontal hexagons in the upper right-hand corner. They will be white if the Mode is 0. For all other modes, they are black.)
* Mode 1 – Obsolete mode superseded by mode 4.
* Mode 2 – Formatted data containing a structured Carrier Message with a numeric postal code. (Primary use is US domestic destinations.)
* Mode 3 – Formatted data containing a structured Carrier Message with an alphanumeric postal code. (Primary use is international destinations.)
* Mode 4 – Unformatted data with Standard Error Correction.
* Mode 5 – Unformatted data with Enhanced Error Correction.
* Mode 6 – Used for programming hardware devices.

UPS labels use Mode 2 or Mode 3 MaxiCodes.

<doc id="650631" wikidata="Q2937366" url="?curid=650631" title="Captaincy of São Vicente">
<text>The Captaincy of São Vicente (1534–1709) was a land grant and colonial administration in the far southern part of the colonial Portuguese Empire in Colonial Brazil. 

==History==
In 1534 King John III of Portugal granted the captaincy to Martim Afonso de Sousa, a Portuguese admiral. De Sousa had founded the first two permanent Portuguese settlements in Brazil in 1532: São Vicente (near the present port of Santos) and Piratininga (later to become São Paulo). 

De Sousa received two tracts of land:

* one centered on the settlement of São Vicente, extending along the coastline from Cananéia to Bertioga (within present-day São Paulo state)
* the other extended from Parati to Cabo Frio (within present-day Rio de Janeiro state).

These two tracts, separated by the Captaincy of Santo Amaro, formed the Captaincy of São Vicente.

In 1681 the São Paulo settlement succeeded São Vicente as the capital of the captaincy, and the name of the latter gradually fell into disuse.

São Vicente became the only captaincy to flourish in southern Brazil. It ultimately gave rise to São Paulo state and provided the base for the bandeirantes to expand Portuguese America west of the Tordesilhas Line.

<doc id="650638" wikidata="Q2723168" url="?curid=650638" title="Gaff rig">
<text>Gaff rig is a sailing rig (configuration of sails, mast and stays) in which the sail is four-cornered, fore-and-aft rigged, controlled at its peak and, usually, its entire head by a spar (pole) called the &quot;gaff&quot;. Because of the size and shape of the sail, a gaff rig will have running backstays rather than permanent backstays.

The gaff enables a fore-and-aft sail to be four sided, rather than triangular. A gaff rig typically carries 25 percent more sail than an equivalent Bermuda rig for a given hull design.

A sail hoisted from a gaff is called a gaff-rigged (or, less commonly, gaff rigged or gaffrigged) sail.

==Description==
Gaff rig remains the most popular fore-aft rig for schooner and barquentine mainsails and other course sails, and spanker sails on a square rigged vessel are always gaff rigged. On other rigs, particularly the sloop, ketch and yawl, gaff rigged sails were once common but have now been largely replaced by the Bermuda rig sail, which, in addition to being simpler than the gaff rig, usually allows vessels to sail closer to the direction from which the wind is blowing (i.e. &quot;closer to the wind&quot;).

The gaff is hoisted by two halyards:

* The &quot;throat halyard&quot; hoists the throat of the sail (the end closer to the mast) at the forward end of the gaff and bears the main weight of the sail and the tension of the luff.
* The &quot;peak halyard&quot; lifts the aft end of the gaff and bears the leech tension. Small craft attach the peak halyard to the gaff with a wire span with eyes at both ends looped around the gaff and held in place with small wooden chocks, larger craft have more than one span. Peak halyards pull upwards, approaching the gaff at right angles.
Additionally, a gaff vang may be fitted. It is a line attached to the end of the gaff which prevents the gaff from sagging downwind. Gaff vangs are difficult to rig on the aft-most sail, so are typically only found on schooners or ketches, and then only on the foresail or mainsail.

A triangular fore-and-aft sail called a jib-headed topsail may be carried between the gaff and the mast.

Gunter-rigged boats are similar, smaller vessels on which a spar (commonly, but incorrectly called the gaff) is raised until it is nearly vertical, parallel to the mast and close adjacent to it. Topsails are never carried on gunter rigs.

The spritsail is another rig with a four-sided fore-aft sail. Unlike the gaff rig where the head hangs from a spar along its edge, this rig supports the leech of the sail by means of a spar named a &quot;sprit&quot;. The forward end of the sprit is attached to the mast but bisects the face of the sail, with the after end of the sprit attaching to the peak and/or the clew of the sail.

==Sailing characteristics (small craft)==

For a given sail area a gaff rig has a shorter mast than a Bermudan rig. In short-ended craft with full body, heavy displacement and moderate ballast ratio, it is difficult to set enough sail area in the Bermudan rig without a mast of excessive height and a centre of effort (CE) too high for the limited stability of the hull. Because of its low aspect ratio, the gaff rig is less prone to stalling if oversheeted than something taller and narrower.

===Reaching with gaff sails===

Whilst reaching, the CE being set further back, will encourage a small craft to bear up into the wind, i.e. strong weather helm. The boat builder can compensate for this at design stage, e.g. by shifting the keel slightly aft, or having two jibs to counter the effect. The gaff-cutter is in fact a very popular sailplan for small craft. The helmsman can reduce weather helm significantly, simply by sheeting out the mainsail. Sheeting out may appear to create an inefficient belly in the sail, but it is often a pragmatic alternative to having a heavy helm. A swing keel lifted halfway is the perfect treatment for weather helm on a gaffer. The usual adjustments to mast rake, or even bowsprit length may be made to a gaffer with persistent heavy weather (or lee) helm.

===Running with gaff sails===

On a gaff-rigged vessel, any heading where the wind is within 20 degrees of dead aft is considered a run. When running with a gaff rig, the CE of the mainsail may actually be overboard of the hull, in a stiff wind the craft may want to broach. Running goose winged with a balloon staysail poled out to windward will balance the CE; Nick Skeates circumnavigated &quot;Wylo II&quot; with this configuration.
In light winds, or when racing, a watersail may also be set.

==Gaffers Day==
Since 1972, the Sydney Amateur Sailing Club has regularly hosted a Gaffers Day for any classic sailing boat that can &quot;hoist a spar&quot;. Up to 90 vessels from around Australia take part in sailing on Sydney Harbour in a practical demonstration of the skills and technology used in the nautical past.

<text>St Anne and St Agnes is a church located at Gresham Street in the City of London, near the Barbican. While St Anne&#x27;s is an Anglican foundation, from 1966 to 2013 it was let to a congregation of the Lutheran Church in Great Britain.

==History==

The first mention of a church on the present site is in documents of 1137 which refer to &#x27;St Agnes near Alderychgate&#x27; and the &#x27;priest of St Anne&#x27;s&#x27; which was situated near Aldredesgate&#x27;. There was confusion over the name since the church was described variously in Norman records as &quot;St Anne-in-the-Willows&quot; and as St Agnes. Its unusual double dedication, unique in the City, seems to have been acquired some time in the 15th century.

The church was gutted by a fire in 1548 but was rebuilt soon after. Further work was done in 1624. However, the building&#x27;s 14th-century tower was its only section to survive the Great Fire of London in 1666 (and then only partially).

St Anne and St Agnes was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in 1680, with possible contributions from Robert Hooke. The small brick church is of an unusual design in London, being based on that of a Greek cross; it utilises a vaulted square within a square, a formula based on the Nieuwe Kerk in Haarlem in the Netherlands. Wren also used a similar design at St Martin Ludgate and St Mary-at-Hill. The parish was united with the parish of St John Zachary by Act of Parliament in 1670 as St John&#x27;s was not rebuilt after the Great Fire.

The church was extensively restored in the 18th and 19th centuries, but was largely destroyed by Second World War bombing by German bombers during the London Blitz during the night of 29–30 December 1940. It was rededicated in 1966, largely through donations by the worldwide Lutheran church, for use by the exile Estonian and Latvian communities in London. The reconstructed interior is a mixture of replicas of the prewar fittings and original or copied fittings from other London churches, some of which had also been destroyed in the war but were not reconstructed. The congregation of St Anne&#x27;s Lutheran Church left the church in June 2013, and began to share St Mary-at-Hill with its existing Anglican congregation. The building, now called the VOCES8 Centre, has become the home of the VOCES8 Foundation, an educational charity incorporating the vocal ensemble Voces8.

Famous past parishioners have included the poet John Milton and John Bunyan, author of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&#x27; John Wesley, founder of Methodism, preached twice at the church in 1738. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

<text>St Augustine, Watling Street, was an Anglican church which stood just to the east of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City of London. First recorded in the 12th century, it was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt to the designs of Christopher Wren. This building was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War, and its remains now form part of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Choir School.

==History==

===Medieval church===
The church stood on the north side of Watling Street, at the corner with Old Change. According to Richard Newcourt, the dedication was to St Augustine of Canterbury, rather than St Augustine of Hippo. The earliest recorded mentioned of the church is from 1148. In 1252–3 Alexander le Cordwaner made a grant of land on the north side for its enlargement. John Stow, writing at the end of the 16th century called St Augustine&#x27;s &quot; a fair church,&quot; adding that it had been &quot;lately well repaired.&quot; The church was partly rebuilt, and &quot;in every part of it richly and very worthily beautified&quot; in 1630–1, at a cost to the parishioners of £1,200. The foundations of the northern half of the medieval church were revealed when burials were removed in 1965. The archaeological evidence indicated that the 12th-century church was about long, the thirteenth century extension long and wide.

The medieval building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.

==Rebuilding after the fire==
After the fire the parish was united with that of St Faith&#x27;s, whose congregation had previously worshipped in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. St Augustine&#x27;s was rebuilt to a design by Christopher Wren; the foundations, revealed by the excavations of 1965, were mostly of re-used stones set in mortar. The new church opened in September, 1683, but the steeple was not finished until 1695.

The interior was about long – shorter than the medieval building – wide and high. The nave was divided from the aisles by an arcade supported on Corinthian columns with unusually high bases. The naves and aisles were barrel vaulted, the nave vault being pierced by three skylights on each side. There were galleries on the north side, and at the west end, but the latter was taken down when the organ was moved to the south side. The walls were originally panelled to a height of , but this was later considerably reduced. The reredos had Corinthian columns and the pulpit was of carved oak. The pulpit was modernised by Arthur Blomfield in 1878.

Rectors of the church included John Douglas, later Bishop of Carlisle and of Salisbury, from 1764 to 1787, and Richard Harris Barham, author of the &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot;, from 1842 until his death in 1845.

==Destruction==
The church was destroyed by bombing in 1941. It was not rebuilt, but the tower was restored in 1954 and later incorporated into a new choir school for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, completed in 1967.

The remains of the church were designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

==Faith, the church cat==
The church cat, named Faith, became quite well known after the air raid which destroyed St Augustine&#x27;s in the Second World War. 

In 1936 Faith, a stray cat, turned up at St Augustine&#x27;s church. Although being turned out three times by Father Henry Ross, eventually Faith was allowed to stay. Nobody claimed her so she stayed, attending Sunday services and hunting mice.

Days before the bomb attack on the church she was seen moving her black and white kitten, Panda, to the cellar. Despite being brought back several times, Faith insisted on returning Panda to her refuge. 

On the morning after the air raid the rector searched through the dangerous ruins for the missing animals, and eventually found Faith, surrounded by smouldering rubble and debris but still guarding the kitten in the spot she had selected three days earlier. The story of her premonition and rescue eventually reached Maria Dickin, founder of the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals, and for her courage and devotion Faith was awarded a specially-made silver medal. Her death in 1948 was reported on four continents.

Faith is buried in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s Choir School. A stone marker stands over its grave with the words, &quot;Faith the cat who defied the London Blitz&quot;.

<doc id="650653" wikidata="Q3269883" url="?curid=650653" title="Electronic assessment">
<text>Electronic assessment, also known as digital assessment, e-assessment, online assessment or computer-based assessment, is the use of information technology in assessment such as educational assessment, health assessment, psychiatric assessment, and psychological assessment. This covers a wide range of activities ranging from the use of a word processor for assignments to on-screen testing. Specific types of e-assessment include multiple choice, online/electronic submission, computerized adaptive testing such as the Frankfurt Adaptive Concentration Test, and computerized classification testing.

Different types of online assessments contain elements of one or more of the following components, depending on the assessment&#x27;s purpose: formative, summative and diagnostic. Instant and detailed feedback may (or may not) be enabled.

In formative assessment, often defined as &#x27;assessment for learning&#x27;, digital tools are increasingly being adopted by schools, higher education institutions and professional associations to measure where students are in their skills or knowledge. This can make it easier to provide tailored feedback, interventions or action plans to improve learning and attainment. Gamification is one type of digital assessment tool that can engage students in a different way whilst gathering data that teachers can use to gain insight.

In summative assessment, which could be described as &#x27;assessment of learning&#x27;, exam boards and awarding organisations delivering high-stakes exams often find the journey from paper-based exam assessment to fully digital assessment a long one. Practical considerations such as having the necessary IT hardware to enable large numbers of student to sit an electronic examination at the same time, as well as the need to ensure a stringent level of security (for example, see: Academic dishonesty) are among the concerns that need to resolved to accomplish this transition.

E-marking is one way that many exam assessment and awarding bodies, such as Cambridge International Examinations, are utilizing innovations in technology to expedite the marking of examinations. In some cases, e-marking can be combined with electronic examinations, whilst in other cases students will still hand-write their exam responses on paper scripts which are then scanned and uploaded to an e-marking system for examiners to mark on-screen.

== Application ==
E-assessment is becoming more widely used by exam awarding bodies, particularly those with multiple or international study centres and those which offer remote study courses. Industry bodies such as The e-Assessment Association (eAA), founded in 2008, as well as events run by the Association of Test Publishers (ATP) that focus specifically on Innovations in Testing, represent the growth in adoption of technology-enhanced assessment.

In psychiatric and psychological testing, e-assessment can be used not only to assess cognitive and practical abilities but anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder, i.e. SPAI-B. Widely in psychology. Cognitive abilities are assessed using &quot;e-testing&quot; software, while practical abilities are assessed using &quot;e-portfolios&quot; or &quot;simulation&quot; software.

==Types==
Online assessment is used primarily to measure cognitive abilities, demonstrating what has been learned after a particular educational event has occurred, such as the end of an instructional unit or chapter. When assessing practical abilities or demonstrating learning that has occurred over a longer period of time an online portfolio (or ePortfolio) is often used. The first element that must be prepared when teaching an online course is assessment. Assessment is used to determine if learning is happening, to what extent and if changes need to be made.

===Independent work===

Most students will not complete assignments unless there is an assessment (i.e. motivation). It is the instructor&#x27;s role to catalyze student motivation. Appropriate feedback is the key to assessment, whether or not the assessment is graded.

===Group work===

Students are often asked to work in groups. This brings on new assessment strategies. Students can be evaluated using a collaborative learning model in which the learning is driven by the students and/or a cooperative learning model where tasks are assigned and the instructor is involved in decisions.

Pre-testing – Prior to the teaching of a lesson or concept, a student can complete an online pretest to determine their level of knowledge. This form of assessment helps determine a baseline so that when a summative assessment or post-test is given, quantitative evidence is provided showing that learning has occurred.

Formative assessment – Formative assessment is used to provide feedback during the learning process. In online assessment situations, objective questions are posed, and feedback is provided to the student either during or immediately after the assessment.

Summative assessment – Summative assessments provide a quantitative grade and are often given at the end of a unit or lesson to determine that the learning objectives have been met.

Practice Testing – With the ever-increasing use of high-stakes testing in the educational arena, online practice tests are used to give students an edge. Students can take these types of assessments multiple times to familiarize themselves with the content and format of the assessment.

Surveys – Online surveys may be used by educators to collect data and feedback on student attitudes, perceptions or other types of information that might help improve instruction.

Evaluations – This type of survey allows facilitators to collect data and feedback on any type of situation where the course or experience needs justification or improvement.

Performance testing – The user shows what they know and what they can do. This type of testing is used to show technological proficiency, reading comprehension, math skills, etc. This assessment is also used to identify gaps in student learning.

New technologies, such as the Web, digital video, sound, animations, and interactivity, are providing tools that can make assessment design and implementation more efficient, timely, and sophisticated.

==Electronic marking==

Electronic marking, also known as e-marking and onscreen marking, is the use of digital educational technology specifically designed for marking. The term refers to the electronic marking or grading of an exam. E-marking is an examiner led activity closely related to other e-assessment activities such as e-testing, or e-learning which are student led. E-marking allows markers to mark a scanned script or online response on a computer screen rather than on paper.

There are no restrictions to the types of tests that can use e-marking, with e-marking applications designed to accommodate multiple choice, written, and even video submissions for performance examinations. E-marking software is used by individual educational institutions and can also be rolled out to the participating schools of awarding exam organizations. e-marking has been used to mark many well-known high stakes examinations, which in the United Kingdom include A levels and GCSE exams, and in the US includes the SAT test for college admissions. Ofqual reports that e-marking is the main type of marking used for general qualifications in the United Kingdom.

===History===
Early adopters include the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, (which operates under the brand name Cambridge Assessment) which conducted its first major test of e-marking in November 2000. Cambridge Assessment has conducted extensive research into e-marking and e-assessment. The syndicate has published a series of papers, including research specific to e-marking such as: Examining the impact of moving to on-screen marking on concurrent validity.

In 2007, the International Baccalaureate implemented e-marking. In 2012, 66% of nearly 16 million exam scripts were &quot;e-marked&quot; in the United Kingdom. Ofqual reports that in 2015, all key stage 2 tests in the United Kingdom will be marked onscreen.

In 2010, Mindlogicx implemented onscreen marking system for the first time in India at Anna University enabling easy operations and efficient conduction of high stakes examination.

In 2014, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) announced that most of the National 5 question papers would be e-marked.

In June 2015, the Odisha state government in India announced that it planned to use e-marking for all Plus II papers from 2016.

=== Process ===

E-marking can be used to mark examinations that are completed on paper and then scanned and uploaded as digital images, as well as online examinations. Multiple-choice exams can be either marked by examiners online or be automarked where appropriate. When marking written script exams, e-marking applications provide markers with online tools and resources to mark as they go and can add up marks as they progress without exceeding the prescribed total for each question.

All candidate details are hidden from the work being marked to ensure anonymity during the marking process. Once marking is complete, results can be uploaded immediately, reducing both the time spent by examiners posting results and the wait time for students.

The e-marking FAQ is a comprehensive list of answers to frequently asked questions surrounding e-marking.

==Advantages==
It has also been noted that in regards to university level work, providing electronic feedback can be more time-consuming than traditional assessments, and therefore more expensive.

In 1986, Lichtenwald investigated the test validity and test reliability of either personal computer administration or a paper and pencil administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R). His project report included a review and analysis of the literature of pre-mid 1980s E-assessment systems.

A review of the literature of E-assessment from the 1970s until 2000 examined the advantages and disadvantages of E-assessments.

A detailed review of the literature regarding advantages and disadvantages of E-assessment for different types of tests for different types of students in different educational environment from childhood through young adulthood was completed in 2010.
In higher education settings, there is variation in the ways academics perceive the benefits of e-assessment. While some perceive e-assessment processes as integral to teaching, others think of e-assessment in isolation from teaching and their students&#x27; learning.

===Academic dishonesty===
Academic dishonesty, commonly known as cheating, occurs at all levels of educational institutions. In traditional classrooms, students cheat in various forms such as hidden prepared notes not permitted to be used or looking at another student&#x27;s paper during an exam, copying homework from one another, or copying from a book, article or media without properly citing the source. Individuals can be dishonest due to lack of time management skills, the pursuit of better grades, cultural behavior or a misunderstanding of plagiarism.

Online classroom environments are no exception to the possibility of academic dishonesty. It can easily be seen from a student&#x27;s perspective as an easy passing grade. Proper assignments types, meetings and projects can prevent academic dishonesty in the online classroom. However, online assessment may provide additional possibilities for cheating, such as hacking.

Two common types of academic dishonesty are identity fraud and plagiarism.

Identity fraud can occur in the traditional or online classroom. There is a higher chance in online classes due to the lack of proctored exams or instructor-student interaction. In a traditional classroom, instructors have the opportunity to get to know the students, learn their writing styles or use proctored exams. To prevent identity fraud in an online class, instructors can use proctored exams through the institutions testing center or require students to come in at a certain time for the exam. Correspondence through phone or video conferencing techniques can allow an instructor to become familiar with a student through their voice and appearance. Another option would be personalize assignments to students backgrounds or current activities. This allows the student to apply it to their personal life and gives the instructor more assurance the actual student is completing the assignment. Lastly, an instructor may not make the assignments heavily weighted so the students do not feel as pressured.

Plagiarism is the misrepresentation of another person&#x27;s work. It is easy to copy and paste from the internet or retype directly from a source. It is not only the exact wordage, but the thought or idea.
It is important to learn to properly cite a source when using someone else&#x27;s work.

==Interoperability==
To assist sharing of assessment items across disparate systems, standards such as the IMS Global &quot;Question and Test Interoperability&quot; specification (QTI) have emerged.

<text>The Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great, sometimes abbreviated to St-Barts-the-Great, is a medieval church in the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of London located in Smithfield within the City of London. The building was founded as an Augustinian priory in 1123. It adjoins St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital of the same foundation.

St Bartholomew the Great is named to distinguish it from its neighbouring smaller church of St Bartholomew the Less, founded at the same time within the precincts of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital as a chapel of ease. The two parish churches were reunited in 2012 under the benefice of Great St Bartholomew. Today the buildings house a lively and growing parish with services taking place in both buildings throughout the week.

==History==
===Medieval Priory===
The church was founded in 1123 by Rahere, a prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and an Augustinian canon regular. While at the Vatican, Rahere dreamed that a winged beast came and transported him to a high place, then relayed a message from &quot;the High Trinity and...the court of Heaven&quot; that he was to erect a church in London&#x27;s Smithfield. Rahere travelled to London and was informed that the area in his vision – then a small cemetery – was royal property, and could not be built upon. Henry I, however, granted title of the land to Rahere upon hearing his divine message.

Rahere started construction on the building with the use of servants and child labourers, who collected stones from all over London.
The priory gained a reputation for curative powers, with many sick people filling its aisles, notably on 24 August (St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day). Many miracles were attributed to occur within and without the walls of the building, including &quot;a light sent from heaven&quot; from its first foundation, and especially miraculous healings; many serious disabilities were claimed to be cured after a visit. Many of these cures were undertaken at the church hospital, the still existing St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital.

===Dissolution===
The last Prior was Robert Fuller, the Abbot of Waltham Holy Cross. He was favoured by King Henry VIII, having been invited to attend the christening of Prince Edward, and did not oppose the dissolution of the Priory.

While much of the hospital survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, about half of the priory&#x27;s church was ransacked then demolished in 1543. Having escaped the Great Fire of London of 1666, the surviving parts of the church fell into disrepair. During Canon Edwin Savage&#x27;s tenure as rector, the church was further restored at the cost of more than £60,000. The surviving building had comprised part of a priory adjoining St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, but its nave was pulled down up to the last bay but the lofty crossing arches and choir survive largely intact from the Norman and later Middle Ages, enabling its continued use as a parish church. 

The church and some of the priory buildings were briefly used as the third Dominican friary (Black Friars) of London, refounded by Queen Mary I of England in 1556 and closed in 1559. Part of the main entrance to the church remains at West Smithfield, nowadays most easily recognisable by its half-timbered, late 16th-century, Tudor frontage built on the older (13th-century) stone arch. This adaptation may originally have been carried out by the Dominican friars in the 1550s, or by the post-Reformation patron of the advowson, Lord Rich, Lord Chancellor of England (1547–51). From this gatehouse to the west door of the church, the path leads along roughly where the south aisle of the nave formerly existed. 

Very little of the monastic buildings now survives above ground, but the fragmentary three bays of the c.15 cloister were restored and extended by a further five bays in replica in the 1920s. The footprint of the cloister quadrangle was recreated as a grassed area when adjoining buildings were redeveloped in 2019.

===Later history===
In the early 1720s, at the suggestion of Governor of Pennsylvania Sir William Keith Bt, the American polymath and patriot Benjamin Franklin worked as a typesetter in a printer&#x27;s shop in what is now the Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great.
The Lady chapel at the east end had been previously used for commercial purposes and it was there that Benjamin Franklin worked for a year as a journeyman printer. The north transept was also formerly used as a blacksmith&#x27;s forge.Parts of the site was occupied by squatters in the 18th century.

The principal remaining area of the churchyard is a raised garden, which was laid out by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association&#x27;s landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson in 1885.

In 1888, new parish school rooms, with basement rooms for youth clubs and a soup kitchen, were built on part of the former burial grounds. The works were funded by in part by the rector, Sir Borradaile Savory. The foundation stone was laid on 5 July 1888 by the Duchess of Albany.

The legendary cricketer W. G. Grace, was a member of the congregation here.

===Restoration===
From 1889, the was extensively restored under the direction of architect Sir Aston Webb.This programme of works saw the restoration of the Lady Chapel and fragmentary south transept and a new flint-faced north transept. The scars at the West end where the demolished nave had once joined was given a new flint-faced facade. The restored south transept was opened by Frederick Temple, Bishop of London, on 14 March 1891; and the south transept in February 1893 in the presence of the Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Alexandra of Denmark (Princess of Wales), Edward White Benson (Archbishop of Canterbury) and other dignitaries.

The Priory Church was one of the few City churches to escape major damage during the Blitz. In 1941, the wartime marriage of 11th Duke of Devonshire and the Hon Deborah Mitford celebrated.

The Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman took a flat overlooking the churchyard in Cloth Fair. Betjeman considered the priory church to have the finest surviving Norman interior in London.

In 2005 a memorial service was held for Sir William Wallace, on the 700th anniversary of the Scottish hero&#x27;s execution in nearby Smithfield, organised by the historian David R. Ross.

Charitable distributions in the churchyard on Good Friday continue a tradition established when twenty-one sixpences were placed upon the gravestone of a woman stipulating that the bequest fund an annual distribution to twenty one widows in perpetuity, with hot cross buns nowadays being given not only to widows but others.

The Priory Church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. In April 2007 it became the first Anglican parish church to charge an entrance fee to tourists not attending a worship,though this was discontinued and the church is open free of charge weekdays.

===United Benefice===
For a few years the rector of St Batholomew the Great church was simultaneously priest-in-charge of the nearby St Bartholomew the Less, though the latter retained its own Parochial church council (PCC) and churchwardens. On 1 June 2015 the parishes of both churches were dissolved and replaced with the new united benefice of Great St Bartholomew. The Rector of the former parish of St Bartholomew the Great became Rector of the united benefice and the parish boundary follows precisely those of the two former parishes. A single Parochial Church Council and churchwardens are responsible for both buildings. The parish church is St Bartholomew the Great, while St Bartholomew the Less is a chapel of ease within the parish, the latter bering part of an eucumenical and inter-faith ministry to the patients and staff at the Hospital.

==The Clock Tower==
The brick clock tower was constructed in the South West corner of the truncated church in the early 17th century. It has a small timber cupola and houses the earlier ring of pre-Reformation bells that were cast between 1500 and 1514.

==Rahere Monument==
Immediately to the North of the high altar is the monument to founder Rahere. This is in a mixture of the Decorated Gothic and Perpendicular Gothic styles. A painted effigy lies on top of the tomb under an elaborate canopy. It is unclear whether it is the resting place of Rahere&#x27;s remains, or his monument, since it was constructed c.250 years after his death.

==Oriel window==
The interior Oriel Window was installed in the early 16th century by Prior William Bolton, allegedly so that he could keep an eye on the monks. The symbol in the centre panel is a crossbow &quot;bolt&quot; passing through a &quot;tun&quot; (or barrel), a rebus or pun on the name of the prior.
William Camden wrote:
It may be doubtful whether Bolton, Prior of St Bartholomew, in Smithfield, was wiser when he invented for his name a bird-bolt through his Tun, or when he built him a house upon Harrow Hill, for fear of an inundation after a great conjunction of planets in the watery triplicity

==Associated organisations==
St Bartholomew the Great is the adopted guild church of various City livery companies who host services there throughout the year: the Worshipful Company of Butchers (one of the seven oldest livery companies), the Worshipful Company of Founders (whose Hall is beside the church), the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers (incorporated 1448, one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies) whose Hall is on the opposite side of West Smithfield, the Worshipful Company of Fletchers, the Worshipful Company of Farriers (incorporated 1674), the Worshipful Company of Farmers (incorporated 1955). More recent companies with a connection to the church are: Worshipful Company of Information Technologists (incorporated 1992), the Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers (incorporated 2004), the Worshipful Company of Tax Advisers (incorporated 2005), the Company of Public Relations Practitioners (incorporated 2000).

The Priory Church served as the chapel of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor before the establishment of the Society&#x27;s permanent chapel in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 2005.

==Film, television, radio and music videos==
The church was the location for the fourth wedding service in the film &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994) and of scenes in other films: &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, the 1999 film version of Graham Greene&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008), &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009), &quot;Richard II&quot; of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; (2012), &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; (2012), &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2015) and &quot;&quot; (2017). It was also used in &quot;Taboo&quot;. It was used by T-Mobile as a stand-in for Westminster Abbey in its &quot;royal wedding&quot; advertisement (2011). It has also been the location for six music videos of Libera.

Services have been broadcast live on the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;Choral Evensong&quot;, including in 2023 an Evensong service to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the foundation of the church.

Today the principal church services are simulcast on the parish YouTube channel and remain available online for two months.

==Music==

===Organ===

St Bartholomew the Great had an organ installed by John Knopple in 1715, superseded by an organ in 1731 by Richard Bridge. In 1886, this was replaced by the organ from St Stephen Walbrook re-installed by William Hill. Modifications were made in 1931 by Henry Speechly &amp; Son, in 1957 by N.P. Mander and in 1982–83 by the firm of Peter Wells. Specifications of this organ are detailed on the National Pipe Organ Register. but it is considered unplayable. The church is currently using a Viscount digital organ for services, pending the commissioning of a new instrument.

===Choirs===
Unusually for a parish church, the Priory Church Choir comprises professional singers, directed by Rupert Gough. A choir of amateur singers, the Rahere Singers, sing for some services.

===Organists===

==Folklore==
The ghost of Rahere is reputed to haunt the church, following an incident during repair work in the 19th century when the tomb was opened and a sandal removed. The sandal was returned to the church but not Rahere&#x27;s foot, and Rahere since then, as a &quot;shadowy, cowled figure appears from the gloom, brushes by astonished witnesses and fades slowly into thin air. Rahere is said to appear every year on the morning of July the 1st at 7 am, emerging from the Vestry&quot;.

<text>Lough Owel () is a mesotrophic lough in the Midlands of Ireland, situated north of Mullingar, the county town of Westmeath. It has a maximum depth of . Water from Lough Owel feeds the Royal Canal, a canal crossing Ireland from Dublin to the River Shannon. The lake is close to the N4 primary road.

==Hydrology==
Lough Owel and Lough Ennell are two of many lakes that form the River Brosna drainage basin. The Brosna is a tributary of the Shannon, flowing through Mullingar and Kilbeggan, both in Westmeath, and from there through the town of Clara (County Offaly) into the Shannon. It is a large, deep, calcareous spring-fed lake and has clear water with a high pH.

==Islands and history==
There are four main islands in the lough, the largest being Church Island, named because of the ruins of a church known as St. Loman&#x27;s Oratory that used to be in the Parish of Mullingar. St Loman was a hermit on the island, where he was said to have subsisted on a diet of wild alexanders (&quot;Smyrnium olusatrum&quot;). The other three islands are Srudarra Island, Lady&#x27;s Island and Carrickphilbin Island. The Viking chieftain Turgesius is said to have been drowned in Lough Owel by Máel Sechnaill mac Maíl Ruanaid in 845.

==Natural history==
Since 1996 the lake has received international protection as a Ramsar site. The lake and the wetlands surrounding it are rich in vascular plant species, including a number of rare plants. The lake is inhabited by a variety of interesting fish populations and there are many resident and migratory birds. The farmland surrounding the lake is the home to a considerable number of overwintering white-fronted geese from Greenland. It is noted for its birdlife and is also well known amongst anglers, and holds a few char along with brown trout. Because of the limited spawning facilities in the streams feeding the lough, the local Cullion Fish Farm is used to rear some of the trout eggs stripped from the adult fish, and the fish fry is later returned to the lough.

<text>Cananéia is the southernmost city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, near where the Tordesilhas Line passed. The population in 2020 was 12,541 and its area is 1,242.010 km². The elevation is 8 m. The city of Cananéia is host to the Dr. João de Paiva Carvalho research base belonging to the Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo.

Cananéia is considered by some Portuguese and Spanish historians to be the oldest city in Brazil, five months before the founding of São Vicente, but due to the lack of official documentation proving this fact, São Vicente is officially the oldest city in Brazil. The Historic Center of Cananéia, listed by CONDEPHAAT, still preserves the architectural styles adopted by the first houses and churches from the colonial period until the end of the 19th century. The beaches also attract thousands of people in high season, and Ilha do Cardoso has several trails and waterfalls, as well as several archaeological sites. Festivals, cuisine and handicrafts are also attractions apart from the city, whose main sources of income are fishing and tourism.

Due to its natural beauty and rich ecosystem, it is listed as a Natural Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==History==
Founded in 1531, Cananéia is considered by some to be the oldest city in Brazil (5 months before the foundation of São Vicente) but due to the lack of official documentation proving this fact, São Vicente is officially the oldest city in Brazil. The historic center of Cananéia still preserves the architectural styles adopted by the first houses from the colonial period to the end of the 19th century.

==Conservation==

The municipality contains the Ilha do Cardoso State Park, created in 1962. It contains part of the Tupiniquins Ecological Station. It contains the Mandira Extractive Reserve, established in 2002. The municipality contains the Taquari Extractive Reserve, created in 2008. It contains the Ilha do Tumba Extractive Reserve, also created in 2008. It contains the Itapanhapima Sustainable Development Reserve, created at the same time.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Viola riviniana, the common dog-violet, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae, native to Eurasia and Africa. It is also called wood violet and [[dog violet]]. It inhabits woodland edges, grassland and shady hedge banks. It is found in all soils except those which are acid or very wet.

Growing to tall and broad, this prostrate perennial has dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces multiple violet coloured flowers in May and June.

&quot;Viola riviniana&quot; was voted the county flower of Lincolnshire in 2002, following a poll by the wild plant conservation charity Plantlife.

==Distribution==
Common in Ireland and all the British Isles.

==Wildlife value==
It is the food plant of the pearl bordered fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, silver-washed fritillary and high brown fritillary butterflies.

It is a known host of the pathogenic fungus &quot;Puccinia violae&quot;.

==Similar species==
* &quot;Viola odorata&quot; (sweet violet) – fragrant; all the leaves are located at the base of the plant; stipules are gland-tipped
* &quot;Viola canina&quot; (heath dog violet) – clear blue flowers; narrower leaves; smaller teeth on the stipules
* &quot;Viola palustris&quot; (marsh violet) – found in wet places; leaves are kidney-shaped; grows from underground creeping stems; dark-veined flowers; stipules without teeth
* &quot;Viola labradorica&quot; (alpine violet) – &quot;V. riviniana&quot; is sometimes sold by nurseries as &quot;V. labradorica&quot;

<doc id="650667" wikidata="Q1887031" url="?curid=650667" title="Mos maiorum">
<text>The mos maiorum (; &quot;ancestral custom&quot; or &quot;way of the ancestors&quot;; : &quot;mores&quot;, cf. English &quot;mores&quot;; &quot;maiorum&quot; is the genitive plural of &quot;greater&quot; or &quot;elder&quot;) is the unwritten code from which the ancient Romans derived their social norms. It is the core concept of Roman traditionalism, distinguished from but in dynamic complement to written law. The &quot;mos maiorum&quot; was collectively the time-honoured principles, behavioural models, and social practices that affected private, political, and military life in ancient Rome.

==Family and society==
The Roman family (the &quot;&quot;, better translated as &quot;household&quot; than &quot;family&quot;) was hierarchical, as was Roman society. These hierarchies were traditional and self-perpetuating, that is, they supported and were supported by the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;. The &quot;pater familias&quot;, or head of household, held absolute authority over his &quot;familia&quot;, which was both an autonomous unit within society and a model for the social order, but he was expected to exercise this power with moderation and to act responsibly on behalf of his family. The risk and pressure of social censure if he failed to live up to expectations was also a form of &quot;mos&quot;.

The distinctive social relationship of ancient Rome was that between patron &quot;(patronus)&quot; and client &quot;(cliens)&quot;. Although the obligations of this relationship were mutual, they were also hierarchical. The relationship was not a unit, but a network &quot;(clientela)&quot;, as a &quot;patronus&quot; might himself be obligated to someone of higher status or greater power, and a &quot;cliens&quot; might have more than one patron, whose interests might come into conflict. If the &quot;familia&quot; was the discrete unit underlying society, these interlocking networks countered that autonomy and created the bonds that made a complex society possible. Although one of the major spheres of activity within patron-client relations was the law courts, patronage was not itself a legal contract; the pressures to uphold one&#x27;s obligations were moral, founded on the quality of &quot;fides&quot;, &quot;trust&quot; (see Values below), and the &quot;mos&quot;. Patronage served as a model when conquerors or governors abroad established personal ties as patron to whole communities, ties which then might be perpetuated as a family obligation. In this sense, &quot;mos&quot; becomes less a matter of unchanging tradition than precedent.

==Tradition and evolution==
Roman conservatism finds succinct expression in an edict of the censors from 92 BC, as preserved by the 2nd-century historian Suetonius: &quot;All new that is done contrary to the usage and customs of our ancestors, seems not to be right.&quot; However, because the &quot;mos maiorum&quot; was a matter of custom, not written law, the complex norms that it embodied evolved over time. The ability to preserve a strongly-centralised sense of identity while it adapted to changing circumstances permitted the expansionism that took Rome from city-state to world power. The preservation of the &quot;mos maiorum&quot; depended on consensus and moderation among the ruling elite whose competition for power and status threatened it.

Democratic politics, driven by the charismatic appeal of individuals &quot;(populares)&quot; to the Roman people &quot;(populus)&quot;, potentially undermined the conservative principle of the &quot;mos&quot;. Because the higher magistracies and priesthoods were originally the prerogative of the patricians, the efforts of plebeians (the &quot;plebs&quot;) for access could be cast as a threat to tradition (see Conflict of the Orders). Reform was accomplished by legislation, and written law replaced consensus. When plebeians gained admission to nearly all the highest offices, except for a few arcane priesthoods, the interests of plebeian families who ascended to the elite began to align with those of the patricians, creating Rome&#x27;s &quot;nobiles&quot;, an elite social status of nebulous definition during the Roman Republic. The &quot;plebs&quot; and their support of popular politicians continued as a threat to the &quot;mos&quot; and elite consensus into the late Republic, as noted in the rhetoric of Cicero.

During the transition to the Christian Empire, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus argued that Rome&#x27;s continued prosperity and stability depended on preserving the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;, and the early Christian poet Prudentius dismissed the conservative adherence to native Roman traditions as &quot;the superstition of old grandpas&quot; &quot;(superstitio veterum avorum)&quot; and inferior to the new revealed truth of Christianity.

After the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and ascension of the various Barbarian kingdoms, the old Roman mores were then either superseded by or synthesized with the traditions of the Germanic elite and subsequent feudal values.

==Values==
Traditional Roman values were essential to the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;:

===&quot;Fides&quot;===
*The Latin word &quot;fides&quot; encompasses several English words, such as trust/trustworthiness, good faith/faithfulness, confidence, reliability and credibility. It was an important concept in Roman law, as oral contracts were common. The concept of &quot;fides&quot; was personified by the goddess Fides whose role in the &quot;mos maiorum&quot; is indicated by the history of her cult. Her temple is dated from around 254 BC and was located on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, near the Temple of Jupiter.

===&quot;Pietas&quot;===
*&quot;Pietas&quot; was the Roman attitude of dutiful respect towards the gods, homeland, parents and family, which required the maintenance of relationships in a moral and dutiful manner. Cicero defined &quot;pietas&quot; as &quot;justice towards the gods.” It went beyond sacrifice and correct ritual performance to inner devotion and righteousness of the individual, and it was the cardinal virtue of the Roman hero Aeneas in Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. The use of the adjectival form &quot;Pius&quot; as a cognomen reflects its importance as an identifying trait. Like &quot;Fides&quot;, &quot;Pietas&quot; was cultivated as a goddess, with a temple vowed to her in 191 BC and dedicated ten years later.

===&quot;Religio&quot; and &quot;Cultus&quot;===
*Related to the Latin verb &quot;religare&quot;, &quot;to bind&quot;, &quot;religio&quot; was the bond between gods and mortals, as carried out in traditional religious practices for preserving the &quot;pax deorum&quot; (“peace of the gods”). &quot;Cultus&quot; was the active observance and the correct performance of rituals. Religious practice, in this sense, is to be distinguished from &quot;pietas&quot; and its inherent morality. See religion in ancient Rome and imperial cult (ancient Rome).

===&quot;Disciplina&quot;===
*The military character of Roman society suggests the importance of &quot;disciplina&quot;, as related to education, training, discipline and self-control.

===&quot;Gravitas&quot; and &quot;constantia&quot;===
*&quot;Gravitas&quot; was dignified self-control. &quot;Constantia&quot; was steadiness or perseverance. In the face of adversity, a good Roman was to display an unperturbed façade. Roman myth and history reinforced this value by recounting tales of figures such as Gaius Mucius Scaevola, who in a founding legend of the Republic demonstrated his seriousness and determination to the Etruscan king Lars Porsenna by holding his right hand in a fire.

===&quot;Virtus&quot;===
*Derived from the Latin word &quot;vir&quot; (&quot;man&quot;), &quot;virtus&quot; constituted the ideal of the true Roman male. Gaius Lucilius discusses &quot;virtus&quot; in some of his work and says that it is &quot;virtus&quot; for a man to know what is good, evil, useless, shameful or dishonorable. The Roman concept of liberty (&quot;libertas),&quot; for the male citizens, was predicated in part on the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion, and this translated to a refusal to be dominated and a type of &quot;conquest mentality&quot; within Roman manhood (&quot;virtus&quot;). In extension, it was accepted for freeborn Roman males to engage in male-male intercourse only if he took the active penetrative role (otherwise his &quot;virtus&quot; would be in question or violated). Romans relatedly described both sexual and imperial domination in terms of transgressing the recipient&#x27;s &quot;virtus.&quot; One of Rome&#x27;s most important ethical rubrics, sexual morality, was therefore heavily associated with &quot;virtus&quot; and its varied implications for freeborn Roman males.

===&quot;Dignitas&quot; and &quot;auctoritas&quot;===
*&quot;Dignitas&quot; and &quot;auctoritas&quot; were the result of displaying the values of the ideal Roman and the service of the state, in the forms of priesthoods, military positions and magistracies. &quot;Dignitas&quot; was reputation for worth, honour and esteem. Thus, a Roman who displayed their &quot;gravitas&quot;, &quot;constantia&quot;, &quot;fides&quot;, &quot;pietas&quot; and other values of a Roman would possess &quot;dignitas&quot; among their peers. Similarly, by that path, a Roman could earn &quot;auctoritas&quot; (&quot;prestige and respect&quot;).

<text>São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga () was the village that developed as São Paulo, Brazil in the region known as Campos de Piratininga. It was founded as a religious mission and a Jesuit Royal College by priests José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega on January 25, 1554 (the date of the first mass and the anniversary of Saint Paul&#x27;s conversion). The village was initially populated by Portuguese colonists and two tribes of the Guaianás Amerindians. Later, São Paulo was the base of the Bandeirantes who explored the interior in search of slaves and gold. 

==History==
Early European colonisation of Brazil was very limited. Portugal was more interested in trade with Africa and Asia. But with English and French privateer ships just off the coast, the Portuguese Crown believed it needed to protect claims to this territory. To share the burden of defence, the Portuguese King João III divided the coast into &quot;captaincies&quot;, or swathes of land, 50 leagues apart. He distributed them among wealthy, well-connected Portuguese, hoping that each would take care of his territory. Fearing attacks by the numerous Amerindian tribes, João III discouraged development of the territory&#x27;s vast interior.

The first coastal settlement in Brazil, São Vicente, was founded in 1532. It was the first permanent Portuguese colony to thrive in the New World. Twenty-two years later the Tibiriçá Chief and Jesuit missionaries Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta founded the village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga inland from São Vicente. Their mission village was settled on a plateau between the Tamanduateí and the Anhangabaú rivers. On January 25, 1554 the village was formally founded when the priests celebrated the inaugural mass of the Jesuit school. 

Santo André da Borda do Campo was a town founded in 1553 on the same plateau. In 1560, the threat of Indian attack led many colonists to flee from the exposed Santo André da Borda do Campo to the walled Pátio do Colégio in São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga. Two years later, the Colégio was besieged. Though the Portuguese town survived, fighting took place spasmodically for another three decades.

Located just beyond the Serra do Mar cliffs, above the port city of Santos, and close to the Tietê River, the new settlement became the natural entrance from the South East coast to the vast and fertile high plateau to the West. This eventually developed as the richest Brazilian state. 

The inhabitants of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, called Paulistanos, were very poor. Some men started explorations, called &quot;Bandeiras,&quot; in search of precious metals and stones, runaway slaves, and to capture Amerindians to sell in the domestic slave trade. The men were known as the &quot;bandeirantes&quot;; they included allied indigenous Brazilians and spoke Língua Geral. In contrast, the priests had established their mission aimed at converting the Tupi–Guarani indigenous Brazilians to the Catholic faith. They tried to acculturate them to Portuguese ways. From the beginning of the colony, the Jesuit goal of evangelising the Amerindians was opposed by many settlers, who used enslaved Amerindians as labourers and profited also from the slave trade in Indians. 

The expeditions of the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; yielded trade, slaves and metals that were important to the developing economy. The Jesuits were often at odds with them for protecting converted natives in their missions. Finally in 1640 the bandeirantes forced the expulsion of the Jesuits from the village. Not until 1653 did the reigning bandeirante Fernão Dias Paes Leme allow Jesuit priests to return.

São Paulo officially became a city in 1711.

==Campos de Piratininga==
The Campos de Piratininga (&quot;Fields of Piratininga&quot; in Portuguese) is the relatively flat plains territory at the top of the Serra do Mar just off the cities of Santos and São Vicente in the Brazilian state of São Paulo.

Other cities there are São Bernardo da Borda do Campo, Santo André da Borda do Campo and the rest of the Greater São Paulo. The limit of the Campos de Piratininga on the 700 meters-high coastal wall of the Serra do Mar is called Borda do Campo, or the Border of the Field.

<text>Molluscicides () – also known as snail baits, snail pellets, or slug pellets – are pesticides against molluscs, which are usually used in agriculture or gardening, in order to control gastropod pests specifically slugs and snails which damage crops or other valued plants by feeding on them.
A number of chemicals can be employed as a molluscicide:
* Metal salts such as iron(III) phosphate, aluminium sulfate, and ferric sodium EDTA, relatively non-toxic, most are approved for use in organic gardening
* Metaldehyde
* Niclosamide
* Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. methiocarb), highly toxic to other animals and humans with a quick onset of toxic symptoms.

== Accidental poisonings ==

Metal salt-based molluscicides are not that toxic to higher animals. However, metaldehyde-based and especially acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-based products are and have resulted in many deaths of pets and humans. Some products contain a bittering agent that reduces but does not eliminate the risk of accidental poisoning. Anticholinergic drugs such as atropine can be used as an antidote for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor poisoning. There is no antidote for metaldehyde; the treatment is symptomatic.

Slug pellets contain a carbohydrate source (e.g. durum flour) as a bulking agent.

He is a two-time Olympian, having swum at the 2000 and 2008 Olympics for Ireland. He also represented Northern Ireland four times at the Commonwealths and placed fifth twice in the 200m breaststroke. Andrew attended the University of Tennessee.

He became the first Northern Irish person to win a medal at the European Short Course Swimming Championships when he finished second in the 200 m breaststroke at the 2003 Championships at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin, Ireland. His home club is Ards, but as of 2008 he trains in the United States at the University of Tennessee.

After swimming at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney; He failed to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. However, he qualified for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, where he equaled the 200 m LC breaststroke record and placed fifth.

In the months leading up to the 2008 Olympics he tested positive at a drug test. Bree claimed that he had used a nasal spray and did not know it contained banned substances. The results of the drug test were later overturned and he was allowed swim at the Beijing Olympics.

==Beijing 2008 Olympics==
Bree qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics at the 2008 US National Swimming Championships in Indiana by swimming a new personal best time and then-Irish record of 2:13.14 in the 200 m breaststroke. At the British Swimming Championships in June 2008 he swam the 100 m breaststroke in a time of 1:01.83 which allowed him to swim the 100 m breaststroke at the Olympics also. He was also entered in the heats of the 200 metres individual medley but scratched from the heats.

In the 200 m breaststroke heats he won his heat in a time of 2.10.91, breaking his own Irish record by over 2 seconds, and then lowering it again in semi-finals to 2:10.16. He is also Irish record holder in the 100 m breaststroke (1:01.78) and the 200 m individual medley (2:04.43).

==Media==
In 2024, Bree was an analyst on the 2024 Olympics swimming coverage on RTÉ Sport.

<text>The Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) is an application programming interface (API) for network interface controllers (NICs).

==Specification==
It was jointly developed by Microsoft and 3Com Corporation and is mostly used in Microsoft Windows. However, the open-source NDISwrapper and Project Evil driver wrapper projects allow many NDIS-compliant NICs to be used with Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD. magnussoft ZETA, a derivative of BeOS, supports a number of NDIS drivers.

The NDIS forms the logical link control (LLC) sublayer, which is the upper sublayer of the OSI data link layer (layer 2). Therefore, the NDIS acts as the interface between the media access control (MAC) sublayer, which is the lower sublayer of the data link layer, and the network layer (layer 3).

The NDIS is a library of functions often referred to as a &quot;wrapper&quot; that hides the underlying complexity of the NIC hardware and serves as a standard interface for level 3 network protocol drivers and hardware level MAC drivers.

The NDIS versions supported by various Windows versions are as follows:

* NDIS 2.0: MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, OS/2
* NDIS 3.0: Windows for Workgroups 3.11
* NDIS 3.1: Windows 95
* NDIS 4.0: Windows 95 OSR2, NT 4.0, Windows CE 3.0
* NDIS 4.1: Windows 98
* NDIS 5.0: Windows 98 SE, Me, 2000
* NDIS 5.1: Windows XP, Server 2003, Windows CE 4.x, 5.0, 6.0
* NDIS 5.2: Windows Server 2003 SP2
* NDIS 6.0: Windows Vista
* NDIS 6.1: Windows Vista SP1, Server 2008, Windows Embedded Compact 7, Windows Embedded Compact 2013
* NDIS 6.20: Windows 7, Server 2008 R2
* NDIS 6.30: Windows 8, Windows Server 2012
* NDIS 6.40: Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2
* NDIS 6.50: Windows 10, version 1507
* NDIS 6.51: Windows 10, version 1511
* NDIS 6.60: Windows 10, version 1607 and Windows Server 2016
* NDIS 6.70: Windows 10, version 1703
* NDIS 6.80: Windows 10, version 1709
* NDIS 6.81: Windows 10, version 1803
* NDIS 6.82: Windows 10, version 1809 and Windows Server 2019
* NDIS 6.83: Windows 10, version 1903 and Windows Server 2022
* NDIS 6.84: Windows 10, version 2004
* NDIS 6.85: Windows 10, version 21H2
* NDIS 6.86: Windows 11, version 21H2
* NDIS 6.87: Windows 11, version 22H2
* NDIS 6.88: Windows Server 2022, version 23H2
* NDIS 6.89: Windows 11, version 24H2

The traffic accepted by the NIC is controlled by an NDIS Miniport Driver while various protocols, such as TCP/IP, are implemented by NDIS Protocol Drivers. A single miniport may be associated with one or more protocols. This means that traffic coming into the miniport may be received in parallel by several protocol drivers. For example, Winpcap adds a second protocol driver on the selected miniport in order to capture incoming packets. Furthermore, it is possible to simulate several virtual NICs by implementing virtual miniport drivers that send and receive traffic from a single physical NIC. One example of virtual miniport driver usage is to add virtual NICs, each with a different VLAN. Because implementations cannot assume that other drivers received the same buffers, one must treat the incoming buffers as read-only and a driver that changes the packet content must allocate its own buffers. NDIS Miniport drivers can also use Windows Driver Model interfaces to control network hardware. 

Another driver type is NDIS Intermediate Driver. Intermediate drivers sit in-between the MAC and IP layers and can control all traffic being accepted by the NIC. In practice, intermediate drivers implement both miniport and protocol interfaces. The miniport driver and protocol driver actually communicate with the corresponding miniport and protocol interfaces that reside in the intermediate driver. This design enables adding several chained intermediate drivers between the miniport and protocol drivers. Therefore, driver vendors cannot assume that the interface that they send traffic to is implemented by the last driver in the chain. In order to write applications using NDIS, one can use samples that accompany Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Driver Kit (WDK). The &quot;PassThru&quot; sample is a good starting point for intermediate drivers as it implements all the necessary details required in this driver type, but just passes the traffic through to the next driver in the chain.

NDIS 4.1 has implemented WDM features. NDIS 5.0 has implemented TCP/IP offload features.

Since Windows 10 version 2004, a new driver framework for network adapters was created called Network Adapter WDF Class Extension (&quot;NetAdapterCx&quot;) which is meant to simply the driver development process.

<doc id="650690" wikidata="Q605018" url="?curid=650690" title="Purgatorio">
<text>Purgatorio (; Italian for &quot;Purgatory&quot;) is the second part of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, following the &quot;Inferno&quot; and preceding the &quot;Paradiso&quot;. The poem was written in the early 14th century. It is an allegory telling of the climb of Dante up the Mount of Purgatory, guided by the Roman poet Virgilexcept for the last four cantos, at which point Beatrice takes over as Dante&#x27;s guide. Allegorically, &quot;Purgatorio&quot; represents the penitent Christian life. In describing the climb Dante discusses the nature of sin, examples of vice and virtue, as well as moral issues in politics and in the Church. The poem posits the theory that all sins arise from loveeither perverted love directed towards others&#x27; harm, or deficient love, or the disordered or excessive love of good things.

== Overview of Purgatory ==

Dante portrays Purgatory as an island-mountain in the Southern Hemisphere. This realm is divided into three parts. The bottom slopes of Mount Purgatory (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; I–IX) have been designated as &quot;Ante-Purgatory&quot; by commentators. Purgatory proper consists of seven levels or terraces (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; X–XXVII) of suffering and spiritual growth, associated with the seven deadly sins. Finally, the Earthly Paradise is located at the top of the mountain (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXVIII–XXXIII).

=== Passage of time ===
As described in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, the first twenty-four hours of Dante&#x27;s journey took place on earth and started on the evening of Maundy Thursday, 24 March (or 7 April) 1300 (&quot;Inf.&quot; I and II), and the next full day (Good Friday) was spent exploring the depths of Hell with Virgil as a guide (&quot;Inf.&quot; III–XXXIV.69). Dante and Virgil spent the next day ascending from Hell to see the stars (&quot;Inf.&quot; XXXIV.70–139). They arrive at the shore of the Mountain of Purgatory – the only land in the Southern Hemisphere – at 6 am on Easter Sunday, which is 6 pm on Sunday in Jerusalem, since the two points are antipodal. Dante describes Hell as existing underneath Jerusalem, having been created by the impact of Lucifer&#x27;s fall; the Mountain of Purgatory was created by a displacement of rock caused by the same event. The &quot;Purgatorio&quot; picks up where the &quot;Inferno&quot; left off, describing Dante&#x27;s three-and-one-quarter-day trip up the mountain that ends with Dante in the Earthly Paradise at the time of noon on Wednesday, 30 March (or 13 April).

=== Prayer ===
Prayer is a dominant theme in &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. Many of the souls Dante meets are depicted in prayer, with multiple liturgical references to psalms and hymns throughout the terraces. Prayers by the living on behalf of the souls also play a large role in the cantica, with some souls the pilgrim meets along the way requesting prayers from living relatives and even from the pilgrim himself. Dante learns from Manfred of Sicily in Ante-Purgatory that, in Purgatory, prayers from others work by shortening the wait that souls have to endure before entering Purgatory proper and by accelerating the rate at which souls ascend Mount Purgatory. One soul, Forese Donati, has gotten through Ante-Purgatory and the majority of the terraces only five years after his death, because of the prayers of his wife, Nella, on Earth. Forese&#x27;s case, especially when compared to that of Statius, who has spent over 500 years on Mount Purgatory, shows the power of prayer to aid souls after death. Dante receives eleven distinct requests for prayer from individual souls in Purgatory, with most of the requests coming from souls in Ante-Purgatory and with the frequency of requests decreasing as he progresses through Purgatory.

==Ante-Purgatory==
Ante-Purgatory is the region below the entrance into Purgatory proper and houses two main categories of souls whose penitent Christian life was delayed or deficient: the excommunicate and the late-repentant. This transitional space parallels similar sections found in the &quot;Inferno&quot; (the space reserved for the lukewarm and the neutral angels found in &quot;Inferno&quot; III) and in the &quot;Paradiso&quot; (the heavens under the shadow of Earth traversed by the pilgrim in &quot;Paradiso&quot; I–IX).

This region is therefore characterised by a lingering attachment to earthly life and affairs, so that the crowds of souls whom Dante and Virgil meet here all marvel at Dante&#x27;s body in the flesh (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; II–III). As Statius will later explain, Ante-Purgatory is also the only area of Mount Purgatory that is subjected to terrestrial meteorology.

===Shore of the island (Cantos I–II)===
In &quot;Purgatorio&quot; I.4–9, with the sun rising on Easter Sunday, Dante announces his intention to describe Purgatory by invoking the mythical Muses, as he did in Canto II of the &quot;Inferno&quot;:
Now I shall sing the second kingdomthere where the soul of man is cleansed,made worthy to ascend to Heaven.

Here from the dead let poetry rise up,O sacred Muses, since I am yours.Here let Calliope arise...
At the shores of Purgatory, Dante and Virgil meet Cato, a pagan who was placed by God as the general guardian of the approach to the mountain (his symbolic significance has been much debated). The &quot;Purgatorio&quot; demonstrates the medieval knowledge of a spherical Earth, with Dante referencing the different stars visible in the Southern Hemisphere, the altered position of the sun, and the various time zones of the Earth. For instance, at the start of Canto II, the reader learns that it is dawn in Purgatory; Dante conveys this concept by explaining that it is sunset at Jerusalem (antipodal to the Mount of Purgatory), midnight (six hours later) over India on the River Ganges (with the constellation Libra overhead there), and noon (six hours earlier) over Spain. The journey is conceived as taking place during the vernal equinox, when the days and nights are of the same length.
By now the sun was crossing the horizonof the meridian whose highest pointcovers Jerusalem; and from the Ganges,night, circling opposite the sun, was movingtogether with the Scales that, when the lengthof dark defeats the day, desert night&#x27;s hands;so that, above the shore that I had reached,the fair Aurora&#x27;s white and scarlet cheekswere, as Aurora aged, becoming orange.

In marked contrast to Charon&#x27;s ferry across the Acheron in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, Christian souls are escorted by an angel pilot from their gathering place somewhere near Ostia, the seaport of Rome at the mouth of the Tiber, through the Pillars of Hercules across the seas to the Mountain of Purgatory. The souls arrive singing &quot;In exitu Israel de Aegypto.&quot; In his &quot;Letter to Cangrande&quot;, Dante explains that this reference to Israel leaving Egypt refers both to the redemption of Christ and to &quot;the conversion of the soul from the sorrow and misery of sin to the state of grace&quot;. Dante recognises his friend Casella among the souls there (Canto II).

===The Excommunicate===
The poets begin to climb in the early hours of morning. On the lower slopes, Dante and Virgil first encounter the excommunicate, who are detained at the base of the cliff for a period thirty times as long as their period of contumacy. The excommunicate include Manfred of Sicily. Manfred explains that prayer from those currently alive and in the grace of God may reduce the amount of time a soul spends in purgatory. The meeting with Manfred is over by about 9 AM. (Canto III).

===The Late-Repentant===

The Late-Repentant include (1) those too lazy or too preoccupied to repent (the Indolent), (2) those who repented at the last minute without formally receiving last rites, as a result of violent deaths, and (3) the Negligent Rulers. These souls will be admitted to Purgatory thanks to their genuine repentance, but must wait outside for an amount of time equal to their lives on earth. The lazy include Belacqua (possibly a deceased friend of Dante), whom Dante is relieved to discover here, rather than in Hell. The meeting with Belacqua is over by noon (Canto IV).

Those not receiving last rites include Pia de&#x27; Tolomei of Siena, who was murdered by her husband, Nello della Pietra of the Maremma (Canto V):
&quot;may you remember me, who am La Pia;Siena made, Maremma unmade me:he who, when we were wed, gave me his pledgeand then, as nuptial ring, his gem, knows that&quot;.
Also in this category is the troubadour Sordello who, like Virgil, is from Mantua. When Sordello discovers the great poet&#x27;s identity, he bows down to him in honour. This helps keep Virgil in the foreground of the poem, since (as a resident of Limbo) Virgil is less qualified as a guide here than he was in Hell. As a resident of Purgatory, Sordello is able to explain the Rule of the Mountain: that after sunset souls are incapable of climbing any further. Allegorically, the sun represents God, meaning that progress in the penitent Christian life can only be made through Divine Grace. Virgil&#x27;s conversation with Sordello ends as the sun is moving downward, that is, after 3 PM (Cantos VI to VII).

It is sunset, so Dante and his companions stop for the night in the beautiful Valley of the Princes where they meet persons whose preoccupation with public and private duties hampered their spiritual progress, particularly deceased monarchs such as Rudolph, Ottokar, Philip the Bold, and Henry III (Cantos VII and VIII). John Ciardi writes that these Negligent Rulers are &quot;elevated above their negligent subjects because their special duties made it difficult for them to think about the welfare of their own souls&quot;. Dante also speaks with the souls of contemporary Italian statesmen Currado Malaspina and Nino Visconti, the latter being a personal friend whom Dante rejoices at not having found among the damned.

As night approaches, the souls sing the Compline hymns &quot;Salve Regina&quot; and &quot;Te lucis ante terminum&quot;. Dante&#x27;s beautiful description of evening in this valley was the inspiration for a similar passage in Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;:


Dante falls asleep at 8:30 PM; his dream takes place just before the dawn of Easter Monday, one where a golden eagle sweeps him up into the sky. Awakening just after 8 AM, Dante finds that he has been carried up to the gate of Purgatory proper. Here there are three steps, representative of the tripartite Sacrament of Penance. The first is of white marble so polished it is reflective like a mirror, representing a candid, self-reflective confession and purity of the penitent&#x27;s true self. The next step is dark and cracked, representing the sorrow and broken-heartedness of contrition. It has also been noted that the dark colour is the colour of mourning and the crack is in the shape of a Christian cross. The last step is blood red, symbolising the burning Love that ends a good confession, the blood of Christ, and the restoration of true life. (Canto IX).

The gate of Purgatory, Peter&#x27;s Gate, is guarded by an angel bearing a naked sword, his countenance too bright for Dante&#x27;s sight to sustain. In reply to the angel&#x27;s challenge, Virgil declares that a lady by the name of Lucia brought them there and directed them to the gate. On Virgil&#x27;s advice, Dante mounts the steps and pleads humbly for admission by the angel, who uses the point of his sword to draw the letter &quot;P&quot; (signifying &quot;peccatum&quot;, sin) seven times on Dante&#x27;s forehead, bidding him &quot;take heed that thou wash / These wounds, when thou shalt be within.&quot; With the passage of each terrace and the corresponding purgation of his soul that the pilgrim receives, one of the &quot;P&quot;s will be erased by the angel granting passage to the next terrace. The angel at Peter&#x27;s Gate uses two keys, silver (remorse) and gold (reconciliation), to open the gate – both are necessary for redemption and salvation. As the poets are about to enter, they are warned not to look back.

==Seven terraces of Purgatory==

After passing through the gate of Purgatory proper, Virgil guides the pilgrim Dante through the mountain&#x27;s seven terraces. These correspond to the seven deadly sins or &quot;seven roots of sinfulness&quot;: Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Avarice (and Prodigality), Gluttony, and Lust. The classification of sin here is more psychological than that of the &quot;Inferno&quot;, being based on motives rather than actions. It is also drawn primarily from Christian theology, rather than from classical sources. The core of the classification is based on love: the first three terraces of Purgatory relate to perverted love directed towards actual harm of others, the fourth terrace relates to deficient love (i.e. sloth or acedia), and the last three terraces relate to excessive or disordered love of good things. Each terrace purges a particular sin in an appropriate manner. Those in Purgatory can leave their circle voluntarily, but may only do so when they have corrected the flaw within themselves that led to committing that sin.

The structure of the poetic description of these terraces is more systematic than that of the &quot;Inferno,&quot; and associated with each terrace are an appropriate prayer and beatitude. Robert Hollander describes the shared features of all the terraces as &quot;(1) description of the physical aspect of the terrace, (2) exemplars of the virtue that counters the sin repented here, (3) description of the penitents, (4) recitation of their sins by particular penitents, (5) exemplars of the vice, (6) appearance to Dante of the angel representing the countering virtue&quot;.

===First terrace (Pride)===

The first three terraces of Purgatory relate to sins caused by a perverted love directed towards actual harm of others.

The first of the sins is Pride. Dante and Virgil begin to ascend this terrace shortly after 9 AM. On the terrace where proud souls purge their sin, Dante and Virgil see beautiful sculptures expressing humility, the opposite virtue. The first example is of the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary, where she responds to the angel Gabriel with the words &quot;Ecce ancilla Dei&quot; (&quot;Behold the handmaid of the Lord,&quot; Luke 1:38). An example of humility from classical history is the Emperor Trajan, who, according to a medieval legend, once stopped his journey to render justice to a poor widow (Canto X).

Also associated with humility is an expanded version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer:
&quot;Our Father, You who dwell within the heavensbut are not circumscribed by them out ofYour greater love for Your first works above,Praised be Your name and Your omnipotence,by every creature, just as it is seemlyto offer thanks to Your sweet effluence.Your kingdom&#x27;s peace come unto us, for ifit does not come, then though we summon allour force, we cannot reach it of our selves.Just as Your angels, as they sing Hosanna,offer their wills to You as sacrifice,so may men offer up their wills to You.Give unto us this day the daily mannawithout which he who labours most to moveahead through this harsh wilderness falls back.Even as we forgive all who have doneus injury, may You, benevolent,forgive, and do not judge us by our worth.Try not our strength, so easily subdued,against the ancient foe, but set it freefrom him who goads it to perversity&quot;. 
After being introduced to humility, Dante and Virgil meet the souls of the proud, who are bent over by the weight of huge stones on their backs. As they walk around the terrace, they are to profit from the sculpted examples of humility. The first of these souls is Omberto Aldobrandeschi, whose pride lies in his descent (&quot;I was Italian, son of a great Tuscan: / my father was Guiglielmo Aldobrandesco&quot;), although he is learning to be more humble (&quot;I / do not know if you have heard his name&quot;). Oderisi of Gubbio is an example of pride in achievementshe was a noted artist of illuminated manuscripts. , leader of the Sienese Ghibellines, is an example of pride in dominating others (Canto XI).

In Canto XIII, Dante points out, with &quot;frank self-awareness,&quot; that pride is also a serious flaw of his own:
&quot;I fear much more the punishment below;my soul is anxious, in suspense; alreadyI feel the heavy weights of the first terrace&quot;.
After his conversations with the proud, Dante notes further sculptures on the pavement below, this time illustrating pride itself. The sculptures show Satan (Lucifer), the building of the Tower of Babel, King Saul, Niobe, Arachne, and King Rehoboam, amongst others.

The poets reach the stairway to the second terrace at noon. As they ascend, the Angel of Humility salutes them and brushes Dante&#x27;s forehead with his wings, erasing the letter &quot;P&quot; (&quot;peccatum&quot;) corresponding to the sin of pride, and Dante hears the beatitude &quot;Beati pauperes spiritu&quot; (&quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit&quot;, Matthew 5:3) (Canto XII). Dante is surprised to discover that climbing now seems easier than it did before. Virgil tells him that one of the initials has been removed from his forehead by the angel and that the effort will be increasingly lessened as he climbs higher. Dante compares the stairway to the easy ascent from the Rubiconte, a bridge in Florence, up to San Miniato al Monte, overlooking the city.

===Second terrace (Envy)===
Envy is the sin that &quot;looks with grudging hatred upon other men&#x27;s gifts and good fortune, taking every opportunity to run them down or deprive them of their happiness&quot;. (This in contrast to covetousness, the excessive desire to have things like money.) As one of the envious souls on this terrace says:
&quot;My blood was so afire with envy that,when I had seen a man becoming happy,the lividness in me was plain to see&quot;.
On entering the terrace of the envious, Dante and Virgil first hear voices on the air telling stories of generosity, the opposite virtue. There is, as in all the other terraces, an episode from the life of the Virgin Mary; this time, the scene from the Life of the Virgin is the Wedding at Cana, in which she expresses her joy for the newly married couple and encourages Christ to perform his first miracle. There is also Jesus&#x27; saying &quot;Love your enemies&quot;. A classical story shows the friendship between Orestes and Pylades.

The souls of the envious wear penitential grey cloaks, and their eyes are sewn shut with iron wire, resembling the way a falconer sews shut the eyes of a falcon in order to train it. This results in audible, rather than visual, examples here. Dante and Virgil speak with Sapia Salvani (Canto XIII).

The souls of the envious include Guido del Duca and Rinieri da Calboli. The former speaks bitterly about the ethics of people in towns along the River Arno:
&quot;That river starts its miserable courseamong foul hogs, more fit for acorns thanfor food devised to serve the needs of man.Then, as that stream descends, it comes on cursthat, though their force is feeble, snap and snarl;scornful of them, it swerves its snout away.And, downward, it flows on; and when that ditch,ill-fated and accursed, grows wider, itfinds, more and more, the dogs becoming wolves.Descending then through many dark ravines,it comes on foxes so full of deceitthere is no trap that they cannot defeat&quot;.
The voices on the air also include examples of envy. The classical example is Aglauros, who, according to Ovid, was turned to stone because she was jealous of Hermes&#x27; love for her older sister Herse. The Biblical example is Cain, mentioned here not for his act of fratricide, but for the jealousy of his younger brother Abel that led to it (Canto XIV).

It is middle afternoon and the poets are walking westward along the terrace with the sun in their faces. A dazzling brightness suddenly smites Dante on the brow, which he supposes is caused by the sun; but when he shades his eyes from it, the new brightness persists, and he is forced to close his eyes. Virgil reminds him that the approach of an angel is still too powerful for his earthly senses but says that this will not always be so. The Angel of Charity, having brushed away another &quot;P&quot; from Dante&#x27;s brow, invites him to mount to the next terrace. As he is leaving the terrace, the dazzling light of the terrace&#x27;s angel causes Dante to reveal his scientific knowledge, observing that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection &quot;as theory and experiment will show&quot; (Canto XV).

===Third terrace (Wrath)===
On the terrace of the wrathful, which the poets reach at 3 PM, examples of meekness (the opposite virtue) are given to Dante as visions in his mind. The scene from the Life of the Virgin in this terrace of purgation is the Finding in the Temple. Whereas most parents would be angry at their child for worrying them, Mary is loving and understanding of Christ&#x27;s motives behind his three-day disappearance. In a classical example, the wife of Peisistratos wanted a young man executed for embracing their daughter, to which Peisistratos responded: &quot;What shall we do to one who&#x27;d injure us / if one who loves us earns our condemnation?&quot; Saint Stephen provides a Biblical example, drawn from Acts 7:54–60 (Canto XV):
Next I saw people whom the fire of wrathhad kindled, as they stoned a youth and kepton shouting loudly to each other: &quot;Kill!&quot;&quot;Kill!&quot; &quot;Kill!&quot; I saw him now, weighed down by death,sink to the ground, although his eyes were bentalways on Heaven – they were Heaven&#x27;s gates –Praying to his high Lord, despite the torture,to pardon those who were his persecutors;his look was such that it unlocked compassion.
The souls of the wrathful walk around in blinding acrid smoke, which symbolises the blinding effect of anger:
Darkness of Hell and of a night deprivedof every planet, under meager skies,as overcast by clouds as sky can be,had never served to veil my eyes so thicklynor covered them with such rough-textured stuffas smoke that wrapped us there in Purgatory;my eyes could not endure remaining open ...
The prayer for this terrace is the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;: &quot;Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis ... dona nobis pacem&quot; (&quot;Lamb of God, you who take away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us ... grant us peace&quot;).

Marco Lombardo discourses with Dante on free will – a relevant topic, since there is no point being angry with someone who has no choice over his actions (Canto XVI). Dante also sees visions with examples of wrath, such as Procne, Haman and Lavinia. When the visions have passed, the Angel of Peace appears to greet them. Again the brightness overpowers Dante&#x27;s sight, but he hears the angel&#x27;s invitation to mount to the next terrace and feels a wing brush his forehead, erasing the third &quot;P&quot;. Then follows the pronouncing of the beatitude &quot;Beati pacifici&quot; (&quot;Blessed are the peacemakers&quot;). The poets leave the third terrace just after nightfall (Canto XVII).

While staying on the fourth terrace, Virgil is able to explain to Dante the organisation of Purgatory and its relationship to perverted, deficient, or misdirected love. The three terraces they have seen so far have purged the proud (&quot;he who, through abasement of another, / hopes for supremacy&quot;), the envious (&quot;one who, when he is outdone, / fears his own loss of fame, power, honour, favour; / his sadness loves misfortune for his neighbor&quot;.), and the wrathful (&quot;he who, over injury / received, resentful, for revenge grows greedy / and, angrily, seeks out another&#x27;s harm&quot;). Deficient and misdirected loves are about to follow. Virgil&#x27;s discourse on love concludes at midnight (Cantos XVII and XVIII).

===Fourth terrace (Sloth)===
On the fourth terrace we find souls whose sin was that of deficient love – that is, sloth or acedia. Since they had failed in life to act in pursuit of love, here they are engaged in ceaseless activity. The examples of sloth and of zeal, its opposite virtue, are called out by these souls as they run around the terrace. A scene from the life of the Virgin outlined in this terrace is the Visitation, with Mary going &quot;in haste&quot; to visit her cousin Elizabeth. These examples also include episodes from the lives of Julius Caesar and Aeneas. This activity also replaces a verbal prayer for this terrace. Since the formerly slothful are now too busy to converse at length, this section of the poem is a short one.

Allegorically, spiritual laziness and lack of caring lead to sadness, and so the beatitude for this terrace is &quot;Beati qui lugent&quot; (&quot;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,&quot; Matthew 5:4) (Canto XVIII and XIX).

Dante&#x27;s second night&#x27;s sleep occurs while the poets are on this terrace, and Dante dreams shortly before Tuesday&#x27;s dawn of a Siren, symbol of disordered or excessive love represented by greed, gluttony and lust. Upon awakening from the dream in the light of the sun, Dante is visited by the Angel of Zeal, who removes another &quot;P&quot; from his brow, and the two poets climb toward the fifth terrace (Canto XIX).

===Fifth terrace (Avarice)===

On the last three terraces are those who sinned by loving good things, but loving them in an excessive or disordered way.

On the fifth terrace, excessive concern for earthly goods – whether in the form of greed, ambition or extravagance – is punished and purified. The avaricious and prodigal lie face-down on the ground, reciting the psalm &quot;Adhaesit pavimento anima mea&quot;, taken from Psalm 119:25 (&quot;My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word&quot;), which is a prayer expressing the desire to follow God&#x27;s law. Dante meets the shade of Pope Adrian V, an exemplar of desire for ecclesiastical power and prestige, who directs the poets on their way (Canto XIX).

The scene from the Life of the Virgin, used here to counter the sin of avarice, is the humble birth of Christ. Further down the terrace, Hugh Capet personifies greed for worldly wealth and possessions. He bemoans the way that, in contrast, avarice has motivated the actions of his successors, and &quot;prophesies&quot; events which occurred after the date in which the poem is set, but before the poem was written:
&quot;The other, who once left his ship as prisonerI see him sell his daughter, bargainingas pirates haggle over female slaves.O Avarice, my house is now your captive:it traffics in the flesh of its own childrenwhat more is left for you to do to us?That past and future evil may seem less,I see the fleur-de-lis enter Anagniand, in His vicar, Christ made prisoner.I see Him mocked a second time; I seethe vinegar and gall renewed and Heis slain between two thieves who&#x27;re still alive.And I see the new Pilate, one so cruelthat, still not sated, he, without decree,carries his greedy sails into the Temple&quot;.
These events include Charles II of Naples selling his daughter into marriage to an elderly and disreputable man, and Philip IV of France (&quot;the fleur-de-lis&quot;) arresting Pope Boniface VIII in 1303 (a pope destined for Hell, according to the &quot;Inferno&quot;, but still, in Dante&#x27;s view, the Vicar of Christ). Dante also refers to the suppression of the Knights Templar at Philip&#x27;s instigation in 1307, which freed Philip from debts he owed to the order. Following the exemplars of avarice (these are Pygmalion, Midas, Achan, Ananias and Sapphira, Heliodorus, Polymestor, and Crassus), there is a sudden earthquake accompanied by the shouting of &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;. Dante desires to understand the cause of the earthquake, but he does not question Virgil about it (Canto XX).

In a scene that Dante links to the episode where Jesus meets two disciples on the road to Emmaus, Dante and Virgil are overtaken by a shade who eventually reveals himself as the Roman poet Statius, author of the &quot;Thebaid&quot;. Statius explains the cause of the earthquake: there is a tremor when a soul knows that it is ready to ascend to heaven, which he has just experienced. Dante presents Statius, without obvious or understandable basis, as a convert to Christianity; as a Christian, his guidance will supplement Virgil&#x27;s. Statius is overjoyed to find himself in the company of Virgil, whose &quot;Aeneid&quot; he so greatly admired (Canto XXI).

The Angel of Moderation directs the poets to the passage leading to the next region after brushing another &quot;P&quot; from Dante&#x27;s forehead. Virgil and Statius converse as they ascend toward the next ledge. Statius explains that he was not avaricious but prodigal, but that he &quot;converted&quot; from prodigality by reading Virgil, which directed him to poetry and to God. Statius explains how he was baptized, but he remained a secret Christian – this is the cause of his purgation of Sloth on the previous terrace. Statius asks Virgil to name his fellow poets and figures in Limbo, which he does (Canto XXII).

===Sixth terrace (Gluttony)===
It is between 10 and 11 AM, and the three poets begin to circle the sixth terrace where the gluttonous are purged, and more generally, those who over-emphasised food, drink, and bodily comforts. In a scene reminiscent of the punishment of Tantalus, they are starved in the presence of trees whose fruit is forever out of reach. The examples here are given by voices in the trees. The Virgin Mary, who shared her Son&#x27;s gifts with others at the Wedding at Cana, and John the Baptist, who only lived on locusts and honey (Matthew 3:4), is an example of the virtue of temperance. A classical example of the opposite vice of gluttony is the drunkenness of the Centaurs that led to the Battle of Centaurs and Lapiths.

The prayer for this terrace is &quot;Labia mea Domine&quot; (Psalm 51:15: &quot;O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise&quot;). These are the opening words from the daily Liturgy of the Hours, which is also the source of prayers for the fifth and seventh terraces (Cantos XXII through XXIV).

Here Dante also meets his friend Forese Donati and his poetic predecessor Bonagiunta Orbicciani. Bonagiunta has kind words for Dante&#x27;s earlier work &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;, describing its technique as the &quot;dolce stil novo&quot; (&quot;sweet new style&quot;). He quotes the line &quot;Ladies that have intelligence of love,&quot; written in praise of Beatrice, whom he will meet later in the &quot;Purgatorio&quot;:
Ladies that have intelligence of Love,I of my lady wish with you to speak;Not that I can believe to end her praise,But to discourse that I may ease my mind.I say that when I think upon her worth,So sweet doth Love make himself feel to me,That if I then should lose not hardihood,Speaking, I should enamour all mankind.
Dante is now greeted by the Angel of Temperance, whose brightness is like the red glow of molten metal or glass. Showing the passage up the mountain, the angel removes another &quot;P&quot; from Dante&#x27;s brow with a puff of his wing, and he pronounces the beatitude in paraphrase: &quot;Blessed are they who are so illumined by grace that the love of food does not kindle their desires beyond what is fitting&quot; (Canto XXIV). It is 2:00 PM when the three poets leave the sixth terrace and begin their ascent to the seventh terrace, meaning that they have spent four hours among the Gluttonous. During the climb, Dante wonders how it is possible for bodiless souls to have the gaunt appearance of the souls being starved here. In explaining, Statius discourses on the nature of the soul and its relationship to the body (Canto XXV).

===Seventh terrace (Lust)===
The terrace of lust, the final terrace of Purgatory and the final vice of excessive love, has an immense wall of flame through which every soul must pass (Canto XXV). As a prayer, they sing the hymn &quot;Summae Deus clementiae&quot; (&quot;God of Supreme Clemency&quot;) from the Liturgy of the Hours. Souls repenting of misdirected sexual desire call out in praise of chastity, such as Diana&#x27;s, and of marital fidelity.

Two groups of souls run through the flames calling out examples of lust (Sodom and Gomorrah by the homosexual and Pasiphaë by the heterosexual). The homosexuals run counter to the sun, from west to east, symbolising their sins against nature and God, while the heterosexuals run from east to west, with the sun. Dante&#x27;s depiction of homosexuals as souls capable of salvation is particularly lenient for the time period and is often omitted from later illustrations of &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. In addition, this depiction is a marked massive departure from &quot;Inferno&quot;, where Dante represents sodomy as a sin of violence instead of one of excessive love.

When they meet, the two groups exchange a brief kiss of greeting and a sign of peace before the homosexuals continue and the heterosexuals approach the pilgrim. The pilgrim prays for both groups&#x27; ascent into heaven and stops to speak to Guido Guinizelli, who explains the nature of the vice purged on this terrace and calls the sodomites those who &quot;committed the offense for which Caesar ... once heard himself reproached as &#x27;Queen, alluding to Julius Caesar&#x27;s alleged same-sex relationships.
Shortly before sunset, the poets are greeted by the Angel of Chastity, who instructs them to pass through the wall of fire. By reminding Dante that Beatrice can be found in the Earthly Paradise on the other side, Virgil finally persuades Dante to pass through the intense fire. After the poets pass through the flame, the sun sets and they lie down to sleep on the steps between the final terrace and the Earthly Paradise. On these steps, just before the dawn of Wednesday morning, Dante has his third dream: a vision of Leah and Rachel. They are symbols of the active (lay, or secular) and contemplative (monastic) Christian lives, both important.
... in my dream, I seemed to see a womanboth young and fair; along a plain she gatheredflowers, and even as she sang, she said:&quot;Whoever asks my name, know that I&#x27;m Leah,and I apply my lovely hands to fashiona garland of the flowers I have gathered.To find delight within this mirror Iadorn myself; whereas my sister Rachelnever deserts her mirror; there she sitsall day; she longs to see her fair eyes gazing,as I, to see my hands adorning, long:she is content with seeing, I with labour&quot;.
Dante awakens with the dawn, and the poets continue up the rest of the ascent until they come in sight of the Earthly Paradise (Canto XXVII).

==Earthly Paradise==
At the summit of Mount Purgatory is the Earthly Paradise or Garden of Eden. Allegorically, it represents the state of innocence that existed before Adam and Eve fell from grace – the state which Dante&#x27;s journey up Mount Purgatory has recaptured.

=== The Heavenly Pageant ===
Here Dante meets Matilda, a woman whose literal and allegorical identity &quot;is perhaps the most tantalising problem in the &quot;Comedy&quot;&quot;. Critics up to the early twentieth century tended to connect her with the historical Matilda of Tuscany, but more recently some have suggested a connection with the dream of Leah in Canto XXVII. Be that as it may, Matilda clearly prepares Dante for his meeting with Beatrice, the woman to whom (historically) Dante dedicated his previous poetry, the woman at whose request (in the story) Virgil was commissioned to bring Dante on his journey, and the woman who (allegorically) symbolises the path to God (Canto XXVIII).

With Matilda, Dante witnesses a procession which forms an allegory within the allegory, somewhat like Shakespeare&#x27;s play within a play. It has a very different style from the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; as a whole, having the form of a masque, where the characters are walking symbols rather than real people. The procession consists of (Canto XXIX):

* &quot;Twenty-four elders&quot; (a reference to Revelation 4:4), representing the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible, as classified by Jerome
* &quot;Four animals&quot; with &quot;six wings as plumage&quot; (a reference to Revelation 4:6–8), a traditional representation of the four Evangelists
* &quot;A chariot triumphal on two wheels,&quot; bearing Beatrice, which is drawn by…
* A griffin, representing the conjoined divinity and humanity of Christ
* &quot;Three circling women&quot; coloured red, green, and white, representing the three theological virtues: Love, Hope, and Faith, respectively
* &quot;Four other women&quot; dressed in purple, representing the four cardinal virtues: Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude
* &quot;Two elders, different in their dress,&quot; representing the Acts of the Apostles and the Pauline epistles
* &quot;Four of humble aspect,&quot; representing the general epistles
* &quot;When all the rest had passed, a lone old man,&quot; representing the Book of Revelation

=== Beatrice&#x27;s arrival ===
Canto XXX portrays the transition between Virgil&#x27;s departure and Beatrice&#x27;s arrival. Now that the pilgrim has completed his training in desire and reached the limits of human reason, Virgil can no longer serve as his guide: he has nothing more to teach Dante, because human reason cannot explain or understand divine grace. Beatrice, by contrast, is capable of teaching Dante the meaning of that grace, because she is Christian, and endowed with understanding by God.

Even as Virgil departs, however, his influence on the poem remains strong. Dante&#x27;s farewell to Virgil, with the threefold repetition of Virgil&#x27;s name, echoes a passage from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, wherein Orpheus calls out to Eurydice after he has turned around and condemned her to eternity in the land of the dead.

After Virgil&#x27;s departure, Beatrice begins to admonish Dante, accusing him of straying from the path of virtue she had laid before him after her departure from life on earth. She demands a confession from the pilgrim—his first personal confession in the whole &quot;Comedy&quot;:
&quot;O you who are beyond the sacred river,&quot;turning toward me the point of her speech, whosemere edge had seemed sharp to me,she began again, continuing without delay: &quot;say,say if this is true: to so great an accusation yourconfession must be joined&quot;.
It is not until after more admonitions from Beatrice and a heartfelt confession from Dante that Dante is washed in the River Lethe, which erases the memory of past sin (Canto XXXI), and sees an allegory of Biblical and Church history. This allegory includes a denunciation of the corrupt papacy of the time: a (the papacy) is dragged away with the chariot (the Church) by a giant (the French monarchy, which under King Philip IV engineered the move of the Papal Seat to Avignon in 1309) (Canto XXXII):
Just like a fortress set on a steep slope,securely seated there, ungirt, a whore,whose eyes were quick to rove, appeared to me;and I saw at her side, erect, a giant,who seemed to serve as her custodian;and they again, again embraced each other. 
It is noon as the events observed in the Earthly Paradise come to a close. Finally, Dante drinks from the River Eunoë, which restores good memories, and prepares him for his ascent to Heaven (described in the &quot;Paradiso&quot;, the final &quot;cantica&quot;). As with the other two parts of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; ends on the word &quot;stars&quot; (Canto XXXIII):
From that most holy wave I now returnedto Beatrice; remade, as new trees arerenewed when they bring forth new boughs, I waspure and prepared to climb unto the stars. 
== Location, shape, and size ==
Scholars have long debated the location, shape, and size of various geographic features in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; using astronomical and geometric calculations.

Dante tells us that Mount Purgatory is at the antipodes of Jerusalem, in the South Pacific.

In the Renaissance, Antonio Manetti and Alessandro Vellutello proposed models which Galileo Galilei refuted in his &quot;On the Shape, Location, and Size of Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;. In the 20th century, Rodolfo Benini and Ideale Capasso, and in the 21st, Claudio Facciolo contributed to the debate. The calculations result in an area between 115.6 and 1243 km² and a height between 11.4 and 192 km high. The slope would have been between 23° and 37°.

==In the arts==

The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; has been a source of inspiration for numerous artists for over seven centuries. While references to the &quot;Inferno&quot; are the most common, there are also references to the &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Symphony to Dante&#x27;s Divina Commedia&quot; (1856) has a &quot;Purgatorio&quot; movement, as does Robert W. Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; (2006). Chaucer and others have referenced the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; in their writing. Many visual artists have depicted scenes from the &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, including Gustave Doré, John Flaxman, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John William Waterhouse, and William Blake.

<text>Hyperno (1973–2002) was a Thoroughbred racehorse foaled in New Zealand. He was a wayward but brilliant galloper that won the 1979 Melbourne Cup and other group and listed races.

He was sired by Rangong (GB) out of Mikarla (NZ) by Persian Garden II (GB). He was trained in his early years at Caulfield by Geoff Murphy. A dispute over training methods between Murphy and Hyperno&#x27;s owners in 1978 led to Bart Cummings taking over as trainer. The winner of a string of group and listed races throughout his career, Hyperno won the 1979 Melbourne Cup with jockey Harry White aboard. In 1981, Hyperno was voted Australian Horse of the Year. Hyperno enjoyed a celebrated retirement at the rural property of his Melbourne Cup rider, Harry White, where he died in 2002.

<doc id="650704" wikidata="Q64711016" url="?curid=650704" title="Whiteness studies">
<text>Whiteness studies is the study of the structures that produce white privilege, the examination of what whiteness is when analyzed as a race, a culture, and a source of systemic racism, and the exploration of other social phenomena generated by the societal compositions, perceptions and group behaviors of white people. It is an interdisciplinary arena of inquiry that has developed beginning in the United States from white trash studies and critical race studies, particularly since the late 20th century. It is focused on what proponents describe as the cultural, historical and sociological aspects of people identified as white, and the social construction of &quot;whiteness&quot; as an ideology tied to social status.

Pioneers in the field include W. E. B. Du Bois (&quot;Jefferson Davis as a Representative of Civilization&quot;, 1890; &quot;Darkwater&quot;, 1920), James Baldwin (&quot;The Fire Next Time&quot;, 1963), Theodore W. Allen (&quot;The Invention of the White Race,&quot; 1976, expanded in 1995), historian David Roediger (&quot;The Wages of Whiteness&quot;, 1991), author and literary critic Toni Morrison (&quot;Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination&quot;, 1992), and Ruth Frankenberg (&quot;White Women, Race Matters: The Social Construction of Whiteness&quot;, 1993).

By the mid-1990s, numerous works across many disciplines analyzed whiteness, and it has since become a topic for academic courses, research and anthologies. Some syllabuses associate the dismantling of white supremacy as a stated aim in the understanding of whiteness, while other sources view the field of study as primarily educational and exploratory, such as in questioning the objectivity of generations of works produced in intellectual spheres dominated by white scholars.

A central tenet of whiteness studies is a reading of history and its effects on the present that is inspired by postmodernism and historicism. According to this reading, racial superiority was socially constructed in order to justify discrimination against non-whites. Since the 19th century, some writers have argued that the phenotypical significance attributed to specific races are without biological association, and that what is called &quot;race&quot; is therefore not a biological phenomenon. Many scientists have demonstrated that racial theories are based upon an arbitrary clustering of phenotypical categories and customs, and can overlook the problem of gradations between categories. Thomas K. Nakayama and Robert L. Krizek write about whiteness as a &quot;strategic rhetoric,&quot; asserting, in the essay &quot;Whiteness: A Strategic Rhetoric&quot;, that whiteness is a product of &quot;discursive formation&quot; and a &quot;rhetorical construction&quot;. Nakayama and Krizek write, &quot;there is no &#x27;true essence&#x27; to &#x27;whiteness&#x27;: there are only historically contingent constructions of that social location.&quot; Nakayama and Krizek also suggest that by naming whiteness, one calls out its centrality and reveals its invisible, central position. Whiteness is considered normal and neutral, therefore, to name whiteness means that one identifies whiteness as a rhetorical construction that can be dissected to unearth its values and beliefs.

Major areas of research in whiteness studies include the nature of white privilege and white identity, the historical process by which a white racial identity was created, the relation of culture to white identity, and possible processes of social change as they affect white identity.

== Definitions of whiteness ==
Zeus Leonardo defines whiteness as &quot;a racial discourse, whereas the category &#x27;white people&#x27; represents a socially constructed identity, usually based on skin color&quot;. Steve Garner notes that &quot;whiteness has no stable consensual meaning&quot; and that &quot;the meanings attached to &#x27;race&#x27; are always time- and place-specific, part of each national racial regime&quot;.

==Development of the field==
Studies of whiteness as a unique identity could be said to begin among black people, who needed to understand whiteness to survive, particularly in slave societies such as the American colonies and United States. An important theme in this literature is, beyond the general &quot;invisibility&quot; of blacks to whites, the unwillingness of white people to consider that black people study them anthropologically. American author James Weldon Johnson wrote in his 1912 novel &quot;The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man&quot; that &quot;colored people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them&quot;. Author James Baldwin wrote and spoke extensively about whiteness, defining it as a central social problem and insisting that it was choice, not a biological identity. In &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot; (1963), a non-fiction book on race relations in the United States, Baldwin suggests that 
&quot;White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this—which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never—the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.&quot;A major black theory of whiteness connects this identity group with acts of terrorism—i.e., slavery, rape, torture, and lynching—against black people, who were treated as sub-human.

White academics in the United States and the United Kingdom (UK) began to study whiteness as early as 1983, creating a discipline called &quot;whiteness studies&quot;. The &quot;canon wars&quot; of the late 1980s and 1990s, a term that refers to political controversy over the centrality of white authors and perspectives in United States culture, led the scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin to ask &quot;how the imaginative construction of &#x27;whiteness&#x27; had shaped American literature and American history&quot;. The field developed a large body of work during the early 1990s, which, according to Fishkin, extends across the disciplines of &quot;literary criticism, history, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, popular culture, communication studies, music history, art history, dance history, humor studies, philosophy, linguistics, and folklore&quot;.

As of 2004, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, at least 30 institutions in the United States including Princeton University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of New Mexico and University of Massachusetts Amherst offer, or have offered, courses in whiteness studies. Whiteness studies often overlaps with post-colonial theory, the study of orientalism, and anti-racist education.

One contribution to White Studies is Rich Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America&quot;. The book examines white social beliefs and white anxiety in the contemporary United States, in the context of enormous demographic, cultural, and social change. The book explains how white privilege and segregation might flourish, even in the absence of explicit racial animus.

Another contribution to whiteness studies is Gloria Wekker&#x27;s &quot;White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race&quot;, which discusses the immutability and fluidity of white identity and its relationship to innocence in the context of post-colonial Netherlands in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In Wekker&#x27;s analysis, the process of separating Dutch from &quot;Other&quot; is facilitated through skin tone and non-Christian religious practices. According to Wekker, the process of racialization is reserved for mid-to-late twentieth century immigrant groups (Muslims, Black Surinamese, Black Antilleans), as a means of delineating groups outside the constructed immutable &quot;norms&quot; of Dutch society.

Sociologist Michael Eric Dyson contributed to the discussion of white identity in his 2017 book Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America. Dyson&#x27;s book specifically addresses &quot;five dysfunctional ways that those regarded as white respond when confronted with the reality that whiteness is simultaneously artificial and powerful&quot; as well as &quot;dysfunctional ways that black people sometimes respond to white racism.&quot;

==Areas of study==
===Whiteness===
Whiteness studies draws on research into the definition of race, originating with the United States but applying to racial stratification worldwide. This research emphasizes the historically recent social construction of white identity. As stated by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1920: &quot;The discovery of a personal whiteness among the world&#x27;s peoples is a very modern thing,—a nineteenth and twentieth century matter, indeed.&quot; The discipline examines how white, Native, and African/black identities emerged in interaction with the institutions of slavery, colonial settlement, citizenship, and industrial labor. Scholars such as Winthrop Jordan have traced the evolution of the legally defined line between &quot;blacks&quot; and &quot;whites&quot; to colonial government efforts to prevent cross-racial revolts among unpaid laborers.

Princeton professor Nell Irvin Painter, in her 2010 book &quot;The History of White People,&quot; says the idea of whiteness is not just a matter of biology but also includes &quot;concepts of labor, gender, class, and images of personal beauty&quot;.(p. xi) The earliest European societies, including the Greeks and Romans, had no concept of race and classified people by ethnicity and social class, with the lowest class being slaves, most of whom were European in origin.(p. xi) Race science, developed in Europe in the 1800s, included intense analysis of different groups of Europeans, who were classified as belonging to three or four different races, with the most admirable being from northern Europe.(pp. 215–6) From the early days of the United States, whiteness was a criterion for full citizenship and acceptance into society. The American definition of whiteness evolved over time; initially groups such as Jews and Southern Europeans were not regarded as white, but as skin color became the primary criterion, they were gradually accepted. Painter argues that in the 21st century the definition of whiteness – or more precisely the definition of &quot;nonblackness&quot; – has continued to expand, so that now &quot;The dark of skin who happen to be rich ... and the light of skin from any (racial background) who are beautiful, are now well on their way to inclusion.&quot;(pp. 389–90.)

Academic Joseph Pugliese is among writers who have applied whiteness studies to an Australian context, discussing the ways that Australian Aboriginals were marginalized in the wake of the European colonization of Australia, as whiteness came to be defined as central to Australian identity, diminishing Aboriginal identity in the process. Pugliese discusses the 20th-century White Australia policy as a conscious attempt to preserve the &quot;purity&quot; of whiteness in Australian society. Likewise Stefanie Affeldt considers whiteness &quot;a concept not yet fully developed at the time the first convicts and settlers arrived down under&quot; which, as a social relation, had to be negotiated and was driven forward in particular by the labour movement. Eventually, with the Federation of Australia, &quot;[o]verlaying social differences, the shared membership in the &#x27;white race&#x27; was the catalyst for the consolidation of the Australian colonies as the Commonwealth of Australia&quot;.

===White backlash===

White backlash or white rage in association with or as a consequence of whiteness is an area of investigation in whiteness studies. Sociologist Matthew Hughey has described this examination of racially-based backlash within its historical context; &quot;Another approach to the study of whiteness centres on the white &quot;back-lash&quot; against the advances born from the civil rights movement.&quot;

Political scientist Danielle Allen has analyzed the intersection of whiteness with North American demographic changes, stating how they can &quot;provoke resistance from those whose well-being, status and self-esteem are connected to historical privileges of &#x27;whiteness&#x27;&quot;. Discussing the method of this resistance, Veronica Strong-Boag&#x27;s co-edited &quot;Rethinking Canada: The Promise of Women&#x27;s History&quot; explores how white backlash in Canada attempts to frames the defending of white interests as a &quot;defence of national identity&quot;, rather than an acknowledgement of the political action of whiteness.

Scholar George Yancy has explored the societal response to perceived loss of racial privilege in his 2018 book &quot;Backlash&quot;; how reactions derived from whiteness fluctuate between Robin DiAngelo&#x27;s concept of white fragility versus the more extreme backlashes throughout history.

===White education===
The study of white education and its intersection with whiteness is a continuing area of research in whiteness studies. Scholarly investigation has critiqued white-derived education as inevitably for the benefit of, organized by, and oriented towards white people. Horace Mann Bond was one of the early scholars to identify bias and privilege operating in white education systems. Bond critiqued suggestions African Americans were not intelligent enough to participate in the same schools as white Americans and campaigned against calls for literacy tests for suffrage. He challenged the Southern Manifesto and identified bias for funding white education, rather than universal funding, even within the reformist movement for desegregated schools.

Whiteness and privilege have continued in US education after Jim Crow versions of the segregationist ideology have lost their legitimacy due to legal and political failures. Privacy and individualism discourses mask white fear and newer forms of exclusion in contemporary education according to scholar, Charles R. Lawrence III.

===White identity===

Analyzing whiteness to forge new understandings of white identity has been a field of exploration for academics since the publications which largely founded modern whiteness studies in the mid-1990s. In exploring Ruth Frankenberg&#x27;s works, and her interchanging use of the two concepts, the separation has been examined by scholars attempting to intellectually &quot;disengtangle each from the other&quot;.

Sociologist Howard Winant, favoring a deconstructionist (rather than abolitionist) study of whiteness, suggests this methodology can help redefine and reorient understanding of white identity. In biological examination, whiteness studies has sought to expose how &quot;white identity is neither pure nor unchanging – that its genealogy is mixed&quot; in order to unearth biases within the white racial identity.

===White privilege===

In 1965, drawing from insights from Du Bois and inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, Theodore W. Allen began a 40-year analysis of &quot;white skin privilege&quot;, &quot;white race&quot; privilege, and &quot;white&quot; privilege. In a piece he drafted for a &quot;John Brown Commemoration Committee&quot;, he urged that &quot;White Americans who want government of the people&quot; and &quot;by the people&quot; to &quot;begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges&quot;. From 1967 to 1969 various versions of the pamphlet, &quot;White Blindspot&quot;, containing pieces by Allen and Noel Ignatin (Noel Ignatiev), focused on the struggle against &quot;white skin privilege&quot; and significantly influenced Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and sectors of the New Left. By June 15, 1969, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was reporting that the National Office of SDS was calling &quot;for an all-out fight against &#x27;white skin privileges&#x27;&quot;.

In 1974–1975, Allen extended his analysis of &quot;white privilege&quot;, racial oppression, and social control to the colonial period with his ground-breaking &quot;Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race.&quot; With continued research, he developed his ideas as his seminal two-volume &quot;The Invention of the White Race&quot; published in 1994 and 1997.

For almost forty years, Allen offered a detailed historical analysis of the origin, maintenance, and functioning of &quot;white-skin privilege&quot; and &quot;white privilege&quot; in such writings as: &quot;White Supremacy in U.S. History&quot; (1973); &quot;Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race&quot; (1975); &quot;The Invention of the White Race,&quot; Vol. 1: &quot;Racial Oppression and Social Control&quot; (1994, 2012); &quot;The Invention of the White Race,&quot; Vol. 2: &quot;The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America&quot; (1997, 2012); &quot;Summary of the Argument of &#x27;The Invention of the White Race&#x27;&quot; Parts 1 and 2 (1998); &quot;In Defense of Affirmative Action in Employment Policy&quot; (1998); &quot;&#x27;Race&#x27; and &#x27;Ethnicity&#x27;: History and the 2000 Census&quot; (1999); and &quot;On Roediger&#x27;s Wages of Whiteness&quot; (Revised Edition)&quot;;

In his historical work, Allen asserted that: 
*the &quot;white race&quot; was invented as a ruling class social control formation in the late 17th-/early-18th century Anglo-American plantation colonies (principally Virginia and Maryland); 
*central to this process was the ruling-class plantation bourgeoisie conferring &quot;white race&quot; privileges on European-American working people; 
*these privileges were not only against the interests of African Americans, they were also &quot;poison&quot;, &quot;ruinous&quot;, a baited hook, to the class interests of working people; 
*white supremacy, reinforced by &quot;white skin privilege&quot;, has been the main retardant of working-class consciousness in the US; and
*struggle for radical social change should direct principal efforts at challenging white supremacy and &quot;white skin privileges&quot;. Allen&#x27;s work influenced Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and sectors of the &quot;new left&quot; and paved the way for &quot;white privilege&quot;, &quot;race as social construct&quot;, and &quot;whiteness studies&quot;. He also raised important questions about developments in those areas, and he avoided using the term &quot;whiteness&quot;, using quotation marks when he did.

Laura Pulido writes about the relation of white privilege to racism. 
&quot;White privilege [is] a highly structural and spatial form of racism ... I suggest that historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege and have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism.&quot;Pulido defines environmental racism as &quot;the idea that nonwhites are disproportionately exposed to pollution&quot;.

Writers such as Peggy McIntosh say that social, political, and cultural advantages are accorded to whites in global society. She argues that these advantages seem invisible to white people, but obvious to non-whites. McIntosh argues that whites utilize their whiteness, consciously or unconsciously, as a framework to classify people and understand their social locations. In addition, even though many white people understand that whiteness is associated with privilege, they do not acknowledge their privilege because they view themselves as average and non-racist. Essentially, whiteness is invisible to white people.

For instance, 
&quot;I think whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize male privilege. So I have begun in an untouched way to ask what it is like to have white privilege. I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was &#x27;meant&#x27; to remain oblivious&quot; (188).McIntosh calls for Americans to acknowledge white privilege so that they can more effectively attain equality in American society. She argues, 
&quot;To redesign social systems we need first to acknowledge their colossal unseen dimensions. The silences and denials surrounding privilege are the key political tool here. They keep the thinking about equality or equity incomplete, protecting unearned advantage and conferred dominance by making these taboo subjects&quot; (192).

White privilege is also related to white guilt. As Shannon Jackson writes in the article, &quot;White Noises: On Performing White, On Writing Performance&quot; (1998), &quot;The rhetorics of white guilt are tiresome, cliche, disingenuous, and everywhere. And now that the stereotype of &#x27;the guilty white&#x27; is almost entrenched in its negativity as &#x27;the racist white&#x27;, people actively try to dis-identify from both.&quot;

===White shift===
White racial shift or decline, which has been abbreviated to the phrase whiteshift, and its intersection or connectedness to whiteness, has been a source of study and academic research within the field of whiteness studies. In relation to demographic decline of white people, the phenomenon has been analyzed as producing &quot;a formal re-articulation of whiteness as a social category&quot; in relation to fear-based politics with the US. Academic Vron Ware has examined this fear-based element in the sociology of resentment, and its intersection with class and whiteness. Ware analyzed how white decline, and its portrayal in British media, facilitated a victim or grievance culture, particularly among white British working-class communities.

Political scientist Charles King has proposed that, in the context of the numerical decline of white Americans, whiteness is progressively revealed to be driven by social power, rather than biology.

===White socialization===
White socialization or white-ethnic socialization is an emerging area of research in whiteness studies. Scholar Julia Carmen Rodil has analyzed the role that non-Hispanic white parents play in the racial socialization of white children, arguing that colorblindness as an ideology in upbringing leads to unchecked racism. Research suggests that white people are socialized to perceive race as a zero-sum game and a black-white binary and this informs the beliefs in reverse racism and prejudice plus power. For white youth, parents play a role in conversations around race and racism and this influences racial perceptions and biases into adulthood. Social media has also been found to play a role in the racial socialization of white adolescents.

==Schools of thought==
===Critical whiteness studies===
An offshoot of critical race theory, theorists of critical whiteness studies seek to examine the construction and moral implications of whiteness, in order to reveal and deconstruct its assumed links to white privilege and white supremacy. Barbara Applebaum defines it as the &quot;field of scholarship whose aim is to reveal the invisible structures that produce and reproduce white supremacy and privilege&quot;, and &quot;presumes a certain conception of racism that is connected to white supremacy&quot;. Anoop Nayak describes it as underpinned by the belief that whiteness is &quot;a modern invention [which] has changed over time and place&quot;, &quot;a social norm and has become chained to an index of unspoken privileges&quot;, and that &quot;the bonds of whiteness can yet be broken/deconstructed for the betterment of humanity&quot;. There is a great deal of overlap between critical whiteness studies and critical race theory, as demonstrated by focus on the legal and historical construction of white identity, and the use of narratives (whether legal discourse, testimony or fiction) as a tool for exposing systems of racial power.

==Whiteness and architecture==
In the early 21st century, architectural historians have published studies related to the construction of whiteness in the built environment. Studies have grappled with the exclusionary nature of the architectural profession, which erected barriers for nonwhite practitioners, the ways in which architects and designers have employed motifs, art programs, and color schemes that reflected the aspirations of European-Americans and, most recently, with the racialization of space.

==Criticisms==
Conservative writers David Horowitz and Douglas Murray draw a distinction between whiteness studies and other analogous disciplines. Writes Horowitz, &quot;Black studies celebrates blackness, Chicano studies celebrates Chicanos, women&#x27;s studies celebrates women, and white studies attacks white people as evil.&quot; Dagmar R. Myslinska, an adjunct associate professor of law at Fordham University, argues that whiteness studies overlooks the heterogeneity of whites&#x27; experience, be it due to class, immigrant status, or geographical location. Alastair Bonnett argues that whiteness studies treated &quot;white&quot; culture as a homogenous and stable &quot;racial entity&quot; – for example, Bonnett observes that whiteness researchers in Britain argued that white British people lived in a homogenous &quot;white culture&quot; (which Bonnett observed was never clearly described), with the researchers completely ignoring British culture&#x27;s regional diversity, despite having ample opportunity to study it.

Barbara Kay, a columnist for the &quot;National Post&quot;, has sharply criticized whiteness studies, writing that it &quot;points to a new low in moral vacuity and civilizational self-loathing&quot; and is an example of &quot;academic pusillanimity.&quot; According to Kay, whiteness studies &quot;cuts to the chase: It is all, and only, about white self-hate.&quot;

Kay noted the leanings of the field by quoting Jeff Hitchcock, co-founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of White American Culture (CSWAC) who stated in a 1998 speech:
In addition to such criticism in the mass media, whiteness studies has earned a mixed reception from academics in other fields. In 2001, historian Eric Arnesen wrote that &quot;whiteness has become a blank screen onto which those who claim to analyze it can project their own meanings&quot; and that the field &quot;suffers from a number of potentially fatal methodological and conceptual flaws.&quot; First, Arnesen writes that the core theses of whiteness studies—that racial categories are arbitrary social constructs without definite biological basis, and that some white Americans benefit from racist discrimination of non-whites—have been common wisdom in academia for many decades and are hardly as novel or controversial as whiteness studies scholars seem to believe. Additionally, Arnesen accuses whiteness studies scholars of sloppy thinking; of making claims not supported by their sources; of overstating supporting evidence; and of cherry picking to neglect contrary information.

He notes that a particular datum almost entirely ignored by whiteness studies scholars is religion, which has played a prominent role in conflicts among various American classes. He says that a type of &quot;keyword literalism&quot; persists in whiteness studies, where important words and phrases from primary sources are taken out of their historical context. Whiteness has so many different definitions that the word is &quot;nothing less than a moving target.&quot; Arnesen notes that whiteness studies scholars are entirely on the far left of the political spectrum, and suggests that their apparent vitriol towards white Americans is due in part to white workers not fulfilling the predictions of Marxist theory that the proletariat would overcome racial, national and class distinctions to unite and overthrow capitalism. He cites, as an example, David Roediger&#x27;s afterword to the seminal &quot;Wages of Whiteness&quot;, which asserts that the book was written as a reaction to &quot;the appalling extent to which white male workers voted for Reaganism in the 1980s.&quot; Arnesen argues that in the absence of supporting evidence, whiteness studies often rely on amateurish Freudian speculation about the motives of white people: &quot;The psychoanalysis of whiteness here differs from the &#x27;talking cure&#x27; of Freudianism partly in its neglect of the speech of those under study.&quot; Without more accurate scholarship, Arnesen writes that &quot;it is time to retire whiteness for more precise historical categories and analytical tools.&quot;

In 2002, historian Peter Kolchin offered a more positive assessment and declared that, at its best, whiteness studies has &quot;unfulfilled potential&quot; and offers a novel and valuable means of studying history. Particularly, he praises scholarship into the development of the &quot;concept&quot; of whiteness in the United States, and notes that the definition and implications of a white racial identity have shifted over the decades. Yet Kolchin describes a &quot;persistent sense of unease&quot; with certain aspects of whiteness studies. There is no consensus definition of whiteness, and thus the word is used in vague and contradictory ways, with some scholars even leaving the term undefined in their articles or essays.&quot; Kolchin also objects to &quot;a persistent dualism evident in the work of the best whiteness studies authors,&quot; who often claim that whiteness is a social construct while also arguing, paradoxically, that whiteness is an &quot;omnipresent and unchanging&quot; reality existing independent of socialization. Kolchin agrees that entering a post-racial paradigm might be beneficial for humanity, but he challenges the didactic tone of whiteness studies scholars who single out a white racial identification as negative, while praising a black or Asian self-identification. Scholars in whiteness studies sometimes seriously undermine their arguments by interpreting historical evidence independent of its broader context (e.g., Karen Brodkin&#x27;s examination of American anti-semitism largely neglects its roots in European anti-semitism). Finally, Kolchin categorically rejects the argument—common amongst many whiteness scholars—that racism and whiteness are intrinsically and uniquely American, and he expresses concern at the &quot;belief in the moral emptiness of whiteness [...] there is a thin line between saying that whiteness is evil and saying that whites are evil.&quot;

Theodore W. Allen, pioneering writer on &quot;white skin privilege&quot; and &quot;white privilege&quot; from the 1960s until his death in 2005, offered a critical review &quot;On Roediger&#x27;s Wages of Whiteness&quot; (Revised Edition). He personally put &quot;whiteness&quot; in quotes because he shied away from using the term. As Allen explained,
&quot;it&#x27;s an abstract noun, it&#x27;s an abstraction, it&#x27;s an attribute of some people, it&#x27;s not the role they play. And the white race is an actual objective thing. It&#x27;s not anthropologic, it&#x27;s a historically developed identity of European Americans and Anglo-Americans and so it has to be dealt with. It functions... in this history of ours and it has to be recognized as such. . . .to slough it off under the heading of &#x27;whiteness,&#x27; to me seems to get away from the basic white race identity trauma.&quot;In a scholarly debate with whiteness studies pioneer David Roediger, Eric Kaufmann, a scholar of political demography and identity politics and the author of &quot;Whiteshift&quot; (which was criticised for defending white identity politics), criticizes the field as a whole, arguing :&quot;White Studies suffers from a number of serious flaws which should lead us to question whether this approach can continue to advance the frontiers of knowledge in the wider sphere of ethnic and racial studies&quot;.. These flaws include: 1) a constructivism which fails to recognise the cognitive and social processes that underpin social &#x27;reality&#x27;; 2) an excessive emphasis on ethnic boundaries as opposed to ethnic narratives, thereby overstating the degree of malleability possible in ethnic identity; 3) a tacit belief in white exceptionalism, which overemphasises the ideological character of whiteness and deifies whites; 4) an elision of dominant ethnicity and race; and 5) a threefold parochialism in terms of place, time horizon and the role of race in ethnic studies.&quot;Kaufmann then proposes, as an alternative approach to the study of white identity, the emerging concept of &quot;dominant ethnicity&quot;, using Anthony D. Smith&#x27;s definition of &quot;ethnic group&quot; as a &quot;named, imagined, human community, many of whose members believe in a myth of shared ancestry and place of origin.&quot;

<text>Mount Vernon is a residential area in the east end of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It directly borders Sandyhills and Foxley to the west, while Barlanark is the closest neighbourhood to the north, Barrachnie and Baillieston to the east and Carmyle to the south, although Mount Vernon is separated from these by areas of open land, including Early Braes public park and the former Kenmuir farm.

==History==
The area was originally part of the Parish of Old Monkland, and also of the Barony and Regality of Glasgow. From at least the Middle Ages, the rental book of the Diocese of Glasgow records it as Windy Edge or variations thereof – &quot;AD 1526, Jame Browyn rentalit in vs xd land in the Wyndy Hege&quot;. 
In 1742 a Glasgow merchant named Robert Boyd purchased the &#x27;Old Extent of Windyedge&#x27; and renamed it Mount Vernon, in honour of Admiral Edward Vernon of the Royal Navy who was famous at that time for his expedition against the Spanish Main. Another Glasgow merchant, George Buchanan, whose family had extensive 
interests in tobacco trade purchased the land in 1758 and built an extension to the existing house re-modelling it as a country mansion.

The Mount Vernon of the early 21st century is generally affluent and suburban in character; administratively, the area forms part of the Shettleston ward of Glasgow City Council.

==Landfill site==

To the south of Mount Vernon is Greenoakhill Quarry, one of Europe&#x27;s largest urban landfill sites, operated by Paterson Quarries Ltd. The landfill has been operational since 1955 and receives an assortment of high level waste from all over Scotland. The site covers and is licensed to take up to 500,000 tonnes of waste per year. Landfill gas from the site is collected to fuel gas turbines generating electricity which is fed back into the National Grid.

Greenoakhill Forest is an ongoing project to transform parts of the landfill site no longer in use into public parkland. The first phase of the restored site is open, with newly planted trees, paths and benches.

==Transport==
Mount Vernon railway station is on the Glasgow – Whifflet Line. Services to Glasgow Central depart at xx19 and xx49; services to depart xx26 and xx56.

The M74 motorway runs to the south of Mount Vernon, with Junction 3 the nearest with access to the network in both directions.

<text>A verger (or virger, so called after the staff of the office, or wandsman in British English, though archaic) is a person, usually a layperson, who assists in the ordering of religious services, particularly in Anglican churches.

== Etymology ==
The title of &quot;verger&quot; arises from the ceremonial rod they traditionally carried known as a virge (from the Latin , &quot;branch, staff, rod&quot;; see virgule). The Maces of State used in the House of Lords and the House of Commons of the British Parliament are examples of another modern use of the medieval virge. In former times, a verger might have needed to use his virge to keep back animals or an overenthusiastic crowd from the personage he was escorting or even to discipline unruly choristers.

==History==
The office of verger has its roots in the early days of the Church of England&#x27;s history. The Order shares certain similarities with the former Minor Orders of Porter and Acolyte. Historically, vergers were responsible for the order and upkeep of a house of worship, including the care of the church buildings, its furnishings, and sacred relics, preparations for liturgy, conduct of the laity, and grave-digging responsibilities. Although there is no definitive historical examination of the office of verger, evidence from Rochester, Lincoln, Exeter, and Salisbury Cathedrals points to the existence of vergers even in the 16th century. is the Dutch word for &#x27;sexton&#x27; or &#x27;verger&#x27; (the equivalent German word is ), derived from the Latin (&#x27;guard&#x27;). The symbol of a guild of cathedral vergers is the crossed keys. 

==Duties==
During the service itself, a verger&#x27;s main duty is ceremonially to precede the religious participants as they move about the church; they do not typically take any speaking part in the service itself. It could be argued that a verger&#x27;s main pride during a service lies in their inconspicuousness; vergers often play a very prominent role &quot;behind the scenes&quot;—helping to plan the logistical details of service and discreetly shepherding the clergy through it (in some churches these latter duties are handled by a Master of Ceremonies, while the verger functions as a sort of marshal in the procession).

==Robes==
The typical robes of a verger are a black gown worn over a black cassock. The gown is somewhat like an academic gown and is open-fronted in the English tradition. It is common for a verger&#x27;s gown to bear the arms of the church, usually on one or both sleeves. It can be trimmed with velvet, which may be in another colour (a colour prominently associated with the cathedral, for instance). Formally, a jabot may be worn at the neck.

Less formally, a verger may wear a gown without a cassock below, or, conversely, a cassock without the gown. In more modern settings, a verger might wear a scapular instead of a gown.

If a verger also serves at the altar during divine worship, the gown is often replaced with a surplice.

==Modern function==
Some vergers see their role as one of welcoming or hospitality, encompassing duties such as arranging weddings and funerals or meeting important visitors such as bishops. Vergers at Westminster Abbey, for example, also lead guided tours.

In small churches, the office of the verger is often combined with that of the sexton, who is responsible for maintaining church buildings and grounds. In some organizations the functions of the sexton and the verger are performed by the same person. Equally, many churches have neither a verger nor a sexton and these duties fall to the churchwardens.

In 20th-century debates in the Anglican Church in Australia, some clergy argued that women should be allowed to serve as churchwardens because their experience in housekeeping would lead them to check up on the work of the vergers, indicating that many vergers performed maintenance.

==Catholic Church==
The office of the verger has, for the most part, disappeared in the Catholic tradition, the closest function being that of the sexton or the head or senior usher, particularly in those churches (usually large establishments, like St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City or the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC) that have a formal, organized corps of ushers.

== Cultural references ==
Perhaps the best-known portrait of an Anglican verger in fiction is in Somerset Maugham&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Verger&quot;. In British popular culture, the BBC sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; featured a bumbling caricature of a verger named Maurice Yeatman, played by Edward Sinclair. The sitcom &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, whose title character is among the Church of England&#x27;s first female vicars, also featured a female verger, the dim-witted but well-intentioned Alice Tinker (Emma Chambers).

<doc id="650719" wikidata="Q6915172" url="?curid=650719" title="Morvern Callar">
<text>Morvern Callar is a 1995 experimental novel by Scottish author Alan Warner. Published as his first novel, its first-person narrative—mainly written in Scots—explores the social life and cultural interests of the titular character following the sudden death of her boyfriend.

The novel was a winner of the Somerset Maugham Award in 1996, and a critically acclaimed adaptation directed by Scottish film director Lynne Ramsay was released in 2002.

==Development==
Warner initially developed the narrative of &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; from the perspective of the titular character&#x27;s boyfriend. He became frustrated with the rigidity of the perspective and reworked the novel to be from Callar&#x27;s perspective, and to begin with her boyfriend&#x27;s suicide; he commented that &quot;I was very, very uncomfortable and nervous about it – I didn&#x27;t think it was convincing. I thought the rhythm was very strange. I didn&#x27;t think it was any good. And I didn&#x27;t show it to anyone.&quot;

==Analysis==
&quot;Morvern Callar&quot; has been analyzed as dealing with &quot;the neoliberalization of working conditions from within&quot; in the British Isles, using a polyphonic style of narrative depicting the overlapping yet abruptly changing lives of its characters to convey precarity; hence, &quot;the absence of any collective organization in the novel further emphasizes the divisions that precarity creates&quot;.

<doc id="650743" wikidata="Q2110903" url="?curid=650743" title="List of languages by number of native speakers in India">
<text>The Republic of India is home to several hundred languages. Most Indians speak a language belonging to the families of the Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-European (c. 77%), the Dravidian (c. 20.61%), the Austroasiatic (precisely Munda and Khasic) (c. 1.2%), or the Sino-Tibetan (precisely Tibeto-Burman) (c. 0.8%), with some languages of the Himalayas still unclassified. The SIL Ethnologue lists 424 living languages in India.

== Overview ==
India has not had a national language since its independence in 1947. However, Rule 1976 (As Amended, 1987) of the Constitution of India, mandates English as the &quot;Official Languages&quot; required &quot;for Official Purpose of the Union.&quot; Business in the Indian parliament is transacted in either Hindi or in English. English is allowed for official purposes such as parliamentary proceedings, judiciary, communications between the Central Government and a State Government.

States within India have the liberty and powers to select their own official language(s) through legislation. In addition to the two Official Languages, the constitution recognises 22 regional languages, named in a specific list as &quot;Scheduled Languages&quot;. (Hindi is but English is not.) India&#x27;s Constitution includes provisions detailing the languages used for the official purposes of the union, the languages used for the official purposes of each state and union territory and the languages used for communication between the union and the states.

Hindi is the most widely spoken language, mostly prevalent in the northern parts of India. The Indian census takes the widest possible definition of &quot;Hindi&quot; as a broad variety of the &quot;Hindi Belt&quot;. According to 2001 Census, 53.6% of the Indian population declared that they speak Hindi as either their first or second language, in which 41% of them have declared it as their native language. 12% of Indians declared that they can speak English as a second language.

Hindi is the fastest growing language of India, followed by Kashmiri in the second place, with Meitei (officially called Manipuri) as well as Gujarati, in the third place, and Bengali in the fourth place, according to the 2011 census of India.

Thirteen languages account for more than 1% of Indian population each, and between themselves for over 95%; all of them are &quot;scheduled languages of the constitution&quot;. Scheduled languages spoken by fewer than 1% of Indians are Santali (0.63%), Kashmiri (0.54%), Nepali (0.28%), Sindhi (0.25%), Konkani (0.24%), Dogri (0.22%), Meitei (0.14%), Bodo (0.13%) and Sanskrit (In the 2001 census of India, 14,135 people reported Sanskrit as their native language). The largest language that is not &quot;scheduled&quot; is Bhili (0.95%), followed by Gondi (0.27%), Khandeshi (0.21%), Tulu (0.17%) and Kurukh (0.10%).

As per 2011 census, 26% of Indians are bilingual and 7% are trilingual.

India has a Greenberg&#x27;s diversity index of 0.914—i.e. two people selected at random from the country will have different native languages in 91.4% of cases.

As per the 2011 Census of India, languages by highest number of speakers are as follows: Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam.

== List of languages by number of native speakers ==
Ordered by number of speakers as first language.
=== More than one million speakers ===

The 2011 census recorded 31 individual languages as having more than 1 million native speakers (0.1% of total population). The languages in bold are scheduled languages (the only scheduled language with less than 1 million native speakers is Sanskrit). The first table is restricted to only speaking populations for scheduled languages.

* Excludes figures of Paomata, Mao-Maram and Purul sub-divisions of Senapati district of Manipur for 2001.
** The percentage of speakers of each language for 2001 has been worked out on the total population of India excluding the population of Mao-Maram, Paomata and Purul subdivisions of Senapati district of Manipur due to cancellation of census results.

=== 100,000 to one million speakers ===
== List of mother tongues by number of speakers ==
Each of the &quot;languages&quot; of the 2001 census subsumes one or more &quot;mother tongues&quot;. Speaker numbers are available for these mother tongues and they are also included in the speaker numbers for their respective language. For example, the &quot;language&quot; Telugu (with a total of 81,127,740 speakers) includes the &quot;mother tongues&quot; of Telugu (with 80,912,459 speakers), Vadari (198,020 speakers) and &quot;Others&quot; (17,261 speakers). The General Notes from the 2001 census define &quot;mother tongue&quot; as &quot;the language spoken in childhood by the person&#x27;s mother to the person. If the mother died in infancy, the language mainly spoken in the person&#x27;s home in childhood will be the mother tongue.&quot;

The following table lists those mother tongues that have more than one million speakers according to the 2011 census:

<text>Cindy Cashdollar (born May 25, 1956) is an American musician specializing in steel guitar and Dobro. She grew up in Woodstock, New York, where she perfected her skills by playing with bluegrass musician John Herald, blues musicians Paul Butterfield, and Levon Helm and Rick Danko of The Band. After residing in Austin, Texas, for 23 years, she has now returned to her native Woodstock, New York.

Cashdollar received five Grammy awards while playing for eight years with Asleep at the Wheel, and has also backed such noted performers as Bob Dylan, Leon Redbone, Redd Volkaert, Carla Olson and Ryan Adams as a member of his band The Cardinals. In August 2019, Cashdollar recorded dobro and lap steel on &quot;Save Your Love For Me&quot;, the upcoming new Grayson Hugh record. In 2003, the Academy of Western Artists recognized Cashdollar as Instrumentalist of the Year Award in the Western Swing Music genre. She was inducted into &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; Hall of Fame in 2011–12.

She authored a series of instructional videos on her instruments and released her first solo album, &quot;Slide Show&quot;, in 2004. 
During the fall of 2004 she was a member of Ryan Adams&#x27;s band The Cardinals playing the steel guitar live on stage. She also went into the studio with this band and played on the album &quot;Cold Roses&quot;, although she did not tour the album with Adams &amp; The Cardinals and was replaced in 2005 by Jon Graboff.

From 2005 to 2008, Cashdollar played with Elana James, Redd Volkaert (and, sometimes, Nate Rowe), as The High Flyers, appearing on &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; twice, as well as playing Austin area venues.

In 2006, she toured with Van Morrison promoting his country and western album, &quot;Pay the Devil&quot;. She appeared with him at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, on September 15, 2006 (subsequently released on Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Live at Austin City Limits Festival&quot; limited edition recording), and on the television show &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; featuring Van Morrison, broadcast in November 2006. Cashdollar plays steel guitar on two of the tracks on Morrison&#x27;s March 2008 studio album, &quot;Keep It Simple&quot;. She is an eponymous member of Dave Alvin&#x27;s 2009 project, Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women.

<text>The off side is a particular half of a cricket field.
A cricket field may be notionally divided into two halves, by an imaginary line running down the middle of the pitch, through the middle stumps, and out to the boundary in both directions. The off side is the half of the field &quot;in front of&quot; the on-strike batsman, when the batsman is in normal batting stance. Which half of the field is the off side therefore depends on whether the on-strike batsman is right-handed or left-handed. The other half of the field, behind the on-strike batsman, is called the leg side.

From the point of view of a right-handed batsman facing the bowler, it is the right-hand side of the field. The off side consists of the entire half of the field stretching from behind the batsman-end wicket, around third man, square of the wicket on the off side, the covers, and mid/long off, up to the opposite bowler-end wicket and, behind it, the straight field. To the opposing bowler facing a right-hand batsman, it is the left side of the field. The left-handed batsman&#x27;s off side is to their left and to the opposing bowler&#x27;s right.

==Fielding on the off side==

In the diagram, fielding positions are shown for a right hand bowler approaching over-the-wicket to bowl to a right-handed batsman. Off side field positions in this diagram include the slips, gully, point, cover, mid-off, third man, and long off. Because of the typical line of attack of bowlers, the off side is usually more well-defended with more fielders than the leg side.

==Batting and the off side==
Some common batting strokes that are played through the off side include straight drive to long off, the cover drive, the square cut, the late cut, and the glance to third man. Batsmen skilled in strokeplay through these regions, particularly square of the wicket and through the covers, often become favorites for fans to watch because of the relative difficulty of mastering such shots. Various batsmen have distinguished their style and success through the off side, including such greats as Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Garfield Sobers, Kumar Sangakkara, Jacques Kallis, Rohit Sharma, Chris Gayle, Virender Sehwag, and Sourav Ganguly.

<doc id="650751" wikidata="Q5156470" url="?curid=650751" title="Complete Heyting algebra">
<text>In mathematics, especially in order theory, a complete Heyting algebra is a Heyting algebra that is complete as a lattice. Complete Heyting algebras are the objects of three different categories; the category CHey, the category Loc of locales, and its opposite, the category Frm of frames. Although these three categories contain the same objects, they differ in their morphisms, and thus get distinct names. Only the morphisms of CHey are homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras.

Locales and frames form the foundation of pointless topology, which, instead of building on point-set topology, recasts the ideas of general topology in categorical terms, as statements on frames and locales.

== Definition ==
Consider a partially ordered set (&quot;P&quot;, ≤) that is a complete lattice. Then &quot;P&quot; is a complete Heyting algebra or frame if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

* &quot;P&quot; is a Heyting algebra, i.e. the operation formula_1 has a right adjoint (also called the lower adjoint of a (monotone) Galois connection), for each element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;P&quot;.

* For all elements &quot;x&quot; of &quot;P&quot; and all subsets &quot;S&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, the following infinite distributivity law holds:
::formula_2

* &quot;P&quot; is a distributive lattice, i.e., for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, we have
::formula_3
: and the meet operations formula_1 are Scott continuous (i.e., preserve the suprema of directed sets) for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot;.

The entailed definition of Heyting implication is formula_5

Using a bit more category theory, we can equivalently define a frame to be a cocomplete cartesian closed poset.

==Examples==
The system of all open sets of a given topological space ordered by inclusion is a complete Heyting algebra.

== Frames and locales ==
The objects of the category CHey, the category Frm of frames and the category Loc of locales are complete Heyting algebras. These categories differ in what constitutes a morphism:

* The morphisms of Frm are (necessarily monotone) functions that preserve finite meets and arbitrary joins. 

* The definition of Heyting algebras crucially involves the existence of right adjoints to the binary meet operation, which together define an additional implication operation. Thus, the morphisms of CHey are morphisms of frames that in addition preserves implication. 

* The morphisms of Loc are opposite to those of Frm, and they are usually called maps (of locales).

The relation of locales and their maps to topological spaces and continuous functions may be seen as follows. Let formula_6 be any map. The power sets &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) are complete Boolean algebras, and the map formula_7 is a homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras. Suppose the spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are topological spaces, endowed with the topology &quot;O&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) of open sets on &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Note that &quot;O&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) are subframes of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;). If formula_8 is a continuous function, then formula_9
preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins of these subframes. This shows that &quot;O&quot; is a functor from the category Top of topological spaces to Loc, taking any continuous map
: formula_6
to the map
: formula_11
in Loc that is defined in Frm to be the inverse image frame homomorphism
: formula_12
Given a map of locales formula_13 in Loc, it is common to write formula_14 for the frame homomorphism that defines it in Frm. Using this notation, formula_15 is defined by the equation formula_16

Conversely, any locale &quot;A&quot; has a topological space &quot;S&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), called its &quot;spectrum&quot;, that best approximates the locale. In addition, any map of locales formula_13 determines a continuous map formula_18 Moreover this assignment is functorial: letting &quot;P&quot;(1) denote the locale that is obtained as the power set of the terminal set formula_19 the points of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) are the maps formula_20 in Loc, i.e., the frame homomorphisms formula_21

For each formula_22 we define formula_23 as the set of points formula_24 such that formula_25 It is easy to verify that this defines a frame homomorphism formula_26 whose image is therefore a topology on &quot;S&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). Then, if formula_13 is a map of locales, to each point formula_24 we assign the point formula_29 defined by letting formula_30 be the composition of formula_31 with formula_32 hence obtaining a continuous map formula_33 This defines a functor formula_34 from Loc to Top, which is right adjoint to &quot;O&quot;.

Any locale that is isomorphic to the topology of its spectrum is called &quot;spatial&quot;, and any topological space that is homeomorphic to the spectrum of its locale of open sets is called &quot;sober&quot;. The adjunction between topological spaces and locales restricts to an equivalence of categories between sober spaces and spatial locales.

Any function that preserves all joins (and hence any frame homomorphism) has a right adjoint, and, conversely, any function that preserves all meets has a left adjoint. Hence, the category Loc is isomorphic to the category whose objects are the frames and whose morphisms are the meet preserving functions whose left adjoints preserve finite meets. This is often regarded as a representation of Loc, but it should not be confused with Loc itself, whose morphisms are formally the same as frame homomorphisms in the opposite direction.

<text>The leg side, also called the on side, is a particular half of a cricket field. 
A cricket field may be notionally divided into two halves, by an imaginary line running down the middle of the pitch, through the middle stumps, and out to the boundary in both directions. The leg side is the half of the field &quot;behind&quot; the on-strike batsman, when the batsman is in normal batting stance. Which half of the field is the leg side therefore depends on whether the on-strike batsman is right-handed or left-handed. The other half of the field, in front of the on-strike batsman, is called the off side.

From the point of view of a right-handed batsman facing the bowler, it can also be thought of as the left-hand side of the cricket field, and from the bowler&#x27;s perspective, it is the right-hand side. With a left-handed on-strike batsman, the leg side is to their right, and from the bowler&#x27;s perspective, it is the left-hand side. From the on-strike batsman&#x27;s perspective, it is therefore the side of the field corresponding to their non-dominant hand.

In the picture, the right-handed batsman, facing the bowler in normal batting stance, has his legs more on the right side of the picture, the &quot;leg side&quot;. If the bowler bowls the ball down that side of the pitch it will be &quot;on&quot; the batsman&#x27;s legs, the &quot;on side&quot;.

==Batting and the leg side==
Batting shots that send the ball into the leg side include the leg glance, flick, pull, hook, sweep, and on drive.

When the batsman steps backwards from his normal batting stance on the crease as the ball is bowled, he is said to be moving towards the leg side.

==Fielding on the leg side==

The leg side is usually less well defended with fewer fielders than the off side, because of the typical line of attack of the bowlers, which is frequently on or outside off stump. This makes it more difficult to hit the ball to the leg side because it involves swinging the bat across the line of the ball, which can lead to mishits and catches.

Several fielding positions on the leg side include &#x27;leg&#x27; or &#x27;on&#x27; in their name, including square leg, leg slip, leg gully, fine leg, long leg, mid-on and long on.

While the terms &quot;leg side&quot; and &quot;on side&quot; can refer to an entire half of the field, each term is often used to denote only part of this half. When the batsman plays the ball into this half &quot;in front&quot; of the wicket, it is usually said that the ball has been played to the on side. However, when the ball is played into the region &quot;level with or behind&quot; the wicket, it is said that the ball has been played to the leg side. The names of fielding positions often include the words &quot;leg&quot; or &quot;on&quot;, and they reflect this convention. For example, fine leg is located behind the wicket, whereas mid on is located in front of it.

==Comparison with baseball==

Since the leg side comprises the half of the field behind the batsman, with a right-handed batsman it is roughly analogous to the half of the baseball field that includes left field and third base. With a left-handed batsman, the leg side is analogous to the half that includes right field and first base. Thus hitting to the leg side is directly visually analogous to &quot;pull&quot; hitting in baseball (though since all fair territory in baseball is forward of the batter, &quot;on&quot; would more exactly match this area of the field). Conversely, off is analogous to baseball&#x27;s &quot;opposite-field&quot; hitting.

<doc id="650754" wikidata="Q3215202" url="?curid=650754" title="Shoal Lake (Kenora District, Ontario)">
<text>Shoal Lake () is a lake that straddles the boundary between Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, northwest of the Lake of the Woods. Depending on the water level of Lake of the Woods, Shoal Lake runs both a tributary and distributary of Lake of the Woods and, for many practical purposes, is part of that lake.

There are two First Nations peoples, both Ojibwe, who lay claim to much of Shoal Lake: Iskatewizaagegan 39 Independent First Nation (Shoal Lake First Nation #39) and Shoal Lake 40 First Nation.

==Overview==
Shoal Lake is in the Eastman Region of Manitoba and the Kenora District of Ontario, northwest of Lake of the Woods. It spans approximately from north to south and from east to west.

Smallmouth bass, northern pike, and walleye are its primary species of fish. At one time, it was a commercial fishery for walleye, but this was closed due to overfishing.

There are a number of private cabins in this area, and several commercial fishing lodges and resorts which offer housekeeping cabins and American-plan packages for tourists.

The lake has a history of gold mining and as gold prices rise so does the pressure to explore mining of the lake again. This pressure is being fought by local cottagers and the City of Winnipeg, which has used the lake as its main source of safe drinking water for almost 100 years. Shoal Lake falls under special and specific developmental guidelines in order to protect its water quality and unique wildlife.

== Manitoba ==

In the Manitoba portion, Shoal Lake is a large isolated lake in the southeastern corner of the province.

Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, Ojibwe peoples, who are in the Eastman Region of Manitoba and the Kenora District of Ontario, is one of the First Nations that lays claim to the lake.

Shoal Lake is also home to Manitoba Pioneer Camp.

=== Winnipeg&#x27;s drinking water ===
The City of Winnipeg has relied on the lake as its source for safe drinking water since 1919, supplied via the Greater Winnipeg Water District Aqueduct.

Before it is treated, water from Shoal Lake is stored in Deacon Reservoir, on the east side of the Winnipeg floodway, a few kilometres south of Highway 15.

Access by maintenance staff to the Aqueduct has been provided by the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway, operated by the City, since 1916. The Railway formerly provided passenger and freight rail services to the public, from Winnipeg to the rail station at the Shoal Lake aqueduct intake.

==== Greater Winnipeg Water District ====
The Greater Winnipeg Water District (GWWD) was established in 1913 as a collaboration between the City of Winnipeg and its neighbouring municipalities, who decided to invest CA$13.5 million to access Shoal Lake.

Winnipeg Mayor Thomas R. Deacon spearheaded making Shoal Lake the city&#x27;s water source, a project he had supported long before becoming mayor in 1913. In January 1913, a series of meetings was held between Winnipeg and the municipalities, who reached an agreement on draft legislation to form a water district.

On February 15 that year, &quot;An Act to incorporate the ‘Greater Winnipeg Water District,’&quot; was passed by the Manitoba Legislature. The areas included in the district were the City of Winnipeg, City of St. Boniface, Town of Transcona, and Rural Municipality of St. Vital, as well as a part of the Rural Municipality of Fort Garry, the Rural Municipality of Assiniboia, and the Rural Municipality of Kildonan.

The GWWD was eventually succeeded by the City of Winnipeg Water and Waste Department.

<doc id="650755" wikidata="Q3269591" url="?curid=650755" title="Lynne Ramsay">
<text>Lynne Ramsay (born 5 December 1969) is a Scottish film director, writer, producer, and cinematographer, best known for the feature films &quot;Ratcatcher&quot; (1999), &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; (2002), &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot; (2011), and &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot; (2017). As of now, Ramsay is working on numerous feature films that have not yet been released.

Her works are marked by a fascination with children and young people and the recurring themes of grief, guilt, death, and its aftermath. They have little dialogue and explicit story exposition, and instead use images, vivid details, music, and sound design to create their worlds.

==Early life and education==
Ramsay was born on 5 December 1969 in Glasgow. Her parents introduced her to movies at an early age through the work of Bette Davis, Nicolas Roeg, Alfred Hitchcock, and Michael Curtiz. She also credits the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as an early inspiration.

Ramsay had an early passion for photography. She studied fine art and photography at Napier College, Edinburgh. In class she watched Maya Deren&#x27;s film &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; and later cites it as a turning point in her career, inspiring her to apply to film school on a whim and encouraging her turn towards filmmaking.

In 1995, she graduated from the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, England, where she specialised in cinematography and direction.

==Career==
===Short films (1996–1998)===
In 1996 Ramsay completed her debut short film &quot;Small Deaths&quot; as her graduating film at the UK&#x27;s National Film and Television School. It is a series of three vignettes of children grappling with familial realities and the repercussions of their actions. Ramsay is the writer, director and cinematographer for this film. It won the 1996 Cannes Film Festival Short Film Prix du Jury. Later that same year Ramsay finished &quot;Kill the Day&quot;, her second short film. It captures a day in the life of a heroin addict recently released from jail, and tackles the theme of memory.

&quot;Gasman&quot; (1998), also written and directed by Ramsay, is about a brother and sister who attend a Christmas party with their father, and encounter two other children who are strangely familiar with him. This won her another Prix du Jury that year as well as a Scottish BAFTA for Best Short Film.

===&quot;Ratcatcher&quot; and &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; (1999–2002)===
Ramsay&#x27;s short films impressed Ruth McCance of BBC Scotland, who approached Ramsay to write a treatment for a feature film. This movie turned into Ramsay&#x27;s debut feature &quot;Ratcatcher&quot; which released in 1999 and was funded by BBC Scotland and Pathé. The film was entirely made by first-time filmmakers, as Ramsay enlisted the help of her film school colleagues.
&quot;Ratcatcher&quot; is set in Maryhill, Glasgow during the binmen&#x27;s strike of the 1970s and follows James (William Eadie), the child of a struggling working-class family.
The film received great critical success and while an arthouse hit, didn&#x27;t reach a wider audience. It was screened at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival and opened the Edinburgh International Film Festival, winning her the BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer.

&quot;Morvern Callar&quot; (2002) is based on Alan Warner&#x27;s existential 1995 novel of the same name. The film follows a young girl (Samantha Morton) adrift in Europe following the suicide of her boyfriend, which she doesn&#x27;t report to the police. The movie has been described as a portrait of subversive grief and dissociation. The movie&#x27;s soundtrack included acts like Can, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Broadcast and The Mamas &amp; the Papas.

===The &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; debacle===
In 2001, it was announced Ramsay was slated to direct the adaptation of Alice Sebolds &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, which she had read in a manuscript form prior to its publication. Her script told the story of the murder of a girl from her father&#x27;s perspective.
Shortly after the book turned into a global bestseller resulting in more pressure. Ramsay has said in interviews &quot;People started to call it ‘The Lovely Money,’ they were getting greedy around it. And I could feel the vibes. It became like the Holy Bible, I kept handing in drafts and I thought they were good, but it was like ‘But that’s not exactly like the book, the book’s going to be a success.’ That was the mistake they made with the project.&quot; Then Film4, which had signed her onto the project, was massively downsized and the head of the company ultimately replaced Ramsay with Peter Jackson in 2004, when Jackson was fresh off &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; saga. Ramsay has described dealing with Hollywood as a &quot;David and Goliath situation&quot;.

The loss of &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; hurt Ramsay&#x27;s self-confidence for a while, and the following year was made even more difficult for Ramsay, as both her father and her close friend, Liana Dognini, died. Dognini had been Ramsay&#x27;s co-writer on &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; and the unrealized &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; script.

===&quot;We Need To Talk About Kevin&quot; and &quot;Jane Got a Gun&quot; dispute (2010–2015)===
After a long hiatus Ramsay returned in 2011 with &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot;. The film, based on Lionel Shriver&#x27;s novel, is about a mother (Tilda Swinton) dealing with the aftermath of a school massacre committed by her own son (Ezra Miller). It is again directed by Ramsay and this time co-written with her then-husband Rory Kinnear. Ramsay recalls working together with Jonny Greenwood for the soundtrack of the movie as an especially exciting part of the process.

Starting in 2011, Ramsay was sharing plans to direct a modern science-fiction adaptation of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot; called &quot;Mobius&quot;. The film was to be set in space, and deal with themes of psychology and claustrophobia. Ramsay explained, &quot;So we&#x27;re creating a whole new world, and a new alien. [It&#x27;s] a very psychological piece, mainly taking place in the ship, a bit like &quot;Das Boot&quot;, so it&#x27;s quite claustrophobic. It&#x27;s another monster movie, cos the monster&#x27;s Ahab.&quot; She secured funding for the project in 2012, but as of 2023 the film was still a future project.

The short film &quot;Swimmer&quot; (2012), was co-commissioned by BBC Films, Film4 and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film at the 66th British Academy Film Awards in 2013.

In 2012, Ramsay was slated to direct &quot;Jane Got a Gun&quot;, a movie about the farmer wife of an outlaw husband, who, after his gang turns on him, must defend herself with the help of an old lover. Natalie Portman signed on to star and produce the film. In March 2013, Ramsay abruptly left the project due to creative differences with producers and funders, including over the latter&#x27;s demand for a happy ending. She was replaced by Gavin O&#x27;Connor. Actor Jude Law also left the production shortly after. In November 2013 news broke that the production company behind the movie was suing Ramsay for $750,000, claiming that she had not fulfilled her contractual obligations. The lawsuit also stated that Ramsay &quot;was repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew and was generally disruptive.&quot; Ramsay denied the allegations in a statement made shortly after. A year after parting ways, the lawsuit was resolved out of court. The public aspect of the dispute caused significant backlash against Ramsay. At the same time her marriage with Rory Kinnear came to an end. During the fallout she went to Santorini where she worked on the script that would become her next film, &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot;. She ended up staying in Santorini for four years and in that time got pregnant with and gave birth to her daughter in Athens.

In April 2013, she was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, she was named as a member of the jury for the main competition at the 2015 Venice Film Festival.

===&quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot; and in-between projects (2016–2023)===

&quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot;, an adaptation of Jonathan Ames&#x27;s novella of the same name, premiered to wide critical acclaim at the 70th Cannes Film Festival in 2017, where it received a standing ovation, and Ramsay won the Best Screenplay award. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix as Joe, a war veteran and hitman saving young girls from sex trafficking, was picked up by Amazon Studios. It follows a &quot;shattered [...] narrative structure&quot; in trying to capture the effects of PTSD on the mind. The movie also marks the second collaboration with Jonny Greenwood. She later said she &quot;found her soulmate in making movies&quot; in Phoenix.

Following &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot;, Ramsay hoped to next make the Civil War film &quot;Call Black Horse&quot; starring Casey Affleck, which entered the early stages of development.

In 2018, she revealed she had started writing a script that she describes as an &quot;epic environmental horror&quot;. In November 2020, it was announced Ramsay would be filming an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;. The movie is co-written by Christy Hall, who co-created the Netflix series &quot;I Am Not Okay With This&quot;, and produced by Christine Romero and Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment among others.

&quot;Brigitte&quot;, a short documentary on Brigitte Lacombe, was released in 2019 after being commissioned as part of Miu Miu&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Tales&quot; series. The movie sees both women, who usually prefer being behind the camera, shooting each other.

At the Valencia International Film Festival in 2021 Ramsay revealed that she was working on another movie with Joaquin Phoenix called &quot;Polaris&quot;. It was additionally revealed that it would also co-star Rooney Mara. In a 2024 interview Ramsay described the movie as &quot;Rosemary’s Baby in the Arctic&quot;.

In May 2022, Ramsay announced that she was working on a film adaptation of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Stone Mattress&quot;. The film, which is set to star Julianne Moore, Sandra Oh and Kyle Chandler, has been picked up by Amazon Studios. Ramsay says about the movie &quot;regarding the overturning of Roe v Wade in America this story [...] feels more important than ever.&quot; The movie is set in the Arctic and Greenland.

===&quot;Die, My Love&quot; (2024–present)===
In November 2022, it was announced that Ramsay would be directing an adaptation of Ariana Harwicz’s novel &quot;Die, My Love&quot;, which will be produced by Martin Scorsese and Jennifer Lawrence through Excellent Cadaver. Lawrence will additionally star as a woman who is driven to insanity by her marriage and childbirth. Ramsay said that Lawrence sent her a copy of the book, which is about postpartum depression and bipolar disorder, noting that the film itself would be funny, and that the movie would &quot;probably&quot; be her next film after the 2023 Hollywood strikes. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Irish playwright Enda Walsh. In July 2024, Robert Pattinson entered talks to join the film. In August 2024, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey spoke about reuniting with Ramsay on the film, including citing &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965) and &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968) as influences for the film. Later that month, LaKeith Stanfield, Sissy Spacek, and Nick Nolte joined the cast, during which the project began filming in Calgary.

In 2024, Variety reported Ramsay was writing yet another script with Townend, titled &quot;Hierarchies&quot;. No additional information about the scope of the project was released.

==Personal life==
Ramsay was previously married to Rory Stewart Kinnear, a writer and musician. Her niece, Lynne Ramsay Jr., has starred in multiple roles of her early short films.

Ramsay has one daughter. In an interview with The Guardian Ramsay shared that &quot;We Need To Talk About Kevin&quot; stars Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly are the godparents of the child.

== Influences and themes ==
In 1999, before the release of &quot;Ratcatcher&quot;, she cited Nan Goldin, Richard Billingham, Terrence Malick, Andrei Tarkovsky and John Cassavetes as her creative mentors. In that same interview she spoke about Robert Bresson&#x27;s book &quot;Notes on the Cinematographer&quot; as &quot;a little bible [...] in film school&quot;. Ramsay has also noted Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Fear Eats the Soul&quot;, David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; as deeply moving movie-going experiences.

Ramsays films explore themes of death, rebirth, childhood, loss of innocence, guilt and memory. Many of her movies also deal with grief and its aftermath.

==Critical response==
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Mark Olsen considered Ramsay &quot;one of the leading lights of young British cinema&quot;, describing her additionally as &quot;among the most celebrated British filmmakers of her generation.&quot; 
The Harvard Film Archive describes Ramsay as &quot;an uncompromising filmmaker fascinated by the tremendous power of cinema to appeal directly to the senses and awaken new depths in our audio-visual imagination. Immersive and at times almost overwhelming, Ramsay&#x27;s films abound with uncommon imagery arresting for its remarkable use of texture, composition, color, music and sound.&quot;
British film critic Jonathan Romney, wrote on the topic of &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot;, &quot;Ramsay thinks not in concepts but in images. She doesn&#x27;t make intellectual films, but ones that are close to music, taking visuals to the point of abstraction.&quot;

In 2007, Ramsay was rated number 12 in Guardian Unlimited&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s 40 best directors working at the time.

==Filmography==
Feature films

==Awards and nominations==

<text>Viola arvensis is a species of violet known by the common name field pansy. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it is known on other continents as an introduced species and a weed of disturbed and cultivated areas.

&quot;Viola arvensis&quot; was shown to contain cyclotides, a class of peptides found in plants. The peptide cycloviolacin O2 in particular has shown to possess cytotoxic activity against human cancer cells and is therefore looked at as a potential drug lead.

==Description==
It is an herbaceous annual plant with serrated leaves, and usually flowers with white all over, except the bottom petal (Although there are actually flowers with a tinge of purple at the top) and dehiscent capsules. It reproduces by seed. It grows 20 centimeters tall.

The album itself won three Grammy awards at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993 and became the bestselling live album of all time, and Clapton&#x27;s bestselling album, selling 26 million copies worldwide.

==Recording==
Clapton performed the show in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, England. In addition to the final album tracks, the performance included early versions of &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot; and &quot;Circus Left Town&quot; along with &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; and a version of &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;&quot;.

Shortly after telling the studio audience &quot;that&#x27;s it,&quot; Clapton said they needed to do &quot;two – no, three - no, five&quot; songs over again, adding &quot;if you don&#x27;t mind, I don&#x27;t mind.&quot; After the second take of &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot; there was a brief break and cameras were off. He broke into an impromptu &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;&quot;, which he had last performed with Cream. The seasoned musicians quickly picked up on it and the crowd clapped along. The director signaled the crew to record, which is why there is such an abrupt start to the song mid-verse. Clapton was so pleased with it that when the song ended, he asked the director, &quot;did you get that?&quot;

For much of the performance, Clapton played Martin 000-42 acoustic guitars. In 2004, one of the guitars sold for $791,500 (£434,400) at auction.

==Critical reception==

The album was released on 25 August 1992 to some of the best reviews of his career. The album renewed the public&#x27;s interest in Clapton, and boosted his popularity. Critical reception has been mixed though muted; in general, reviewers report that the album, if unremarkable, is &quot;relaxed&quot; and &quot;pleasant&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine for &quot;AllMusic&quot; feels that people have misrepresented and mythologised the album; that though it came after Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album, &quot;Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)&quot; (1991), people often mistake it for &quot;the first-ever MTV album&quot;, that they often feel that &quot;it alone was responsible for revitalizing Clapton&#x27;s career&quot;, and that &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; was first recorded here. Erlewine feels that the songs are &quot;lively and relaxed&quot;, that Clapton turns &quot;Layla&quot; from an &quot;anguished howl of pain into a cozy shuffle and the whole album proceeds at a similar amiable gait&quot; while &quot;Clapton is embracing his middle age&quot;. Robert Christgau was sharper in his comments, feeling that in an effort to be inoffensive &quot;Clapton-the-electric-guitarist&quot; has been relegated &quot;to the mists of memory&quot;, and that &quot;Layla&quot; was turned into a &quot;whispery greeting card&quot;.

Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; calls the release a &quot;blues album for yuppies&quot; and rates it with 2.5 of 4 stars, saying it is between fair and good. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; journalist Steve Simels scores the album an A− calling the album &quot;a charmer, a collection of blues standards and recent Clapton songs rendered with just the right combination of intensity (a deeply felt version of &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;) and giddy fun (Clapton actually plays kazoo on &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot;)&quot;. Steve Hochman in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt that &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; was &quot;maudlin but moving&quot;, &quot;Layla&quot; was &quot;low-key but seductive&quot;, but the blues numbers performed in an intimate setting makes the album &quot;Clapton&#x27;s most passionate collection in years&quot;. Commenting on the popularity of the album in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wishes the reader to understand the great emotional toll he experienced around that time, and suggests that they visit the grave of his son Conor in Ripley to do so. It was voted number 788 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Accolades==
Clapton was nominated for nine Grammy Awards at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993 and won six, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male, Best Rock Vocal Performance – Male, and Best Rock Song. Although &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; also earned three Grammy Awards, it was the version from &quot;Rush&quot; that the judges awarded.

<doc id="650780" wikidata="Q206243" url="?curid=650780" title="Ethiopian birr">
<text>The birr () is the primary unit of currency in Ethiopia. It is subdivided into 100 santims.

In 1931, Emperor Haile Selassie formally requested that the international community use the name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; (as it had already been known internally for at least 1,600 years) instead of the exonym &quot;Abyssinia&quot;, and the issuing &quot;Bank of Abyssinia&quot; also became the &quot;Bank of Ethiopia&quot;. Thus, the pre-1931 currency may be referred to as the &quot;Abyssinian birr&quot; and the post-1931 currency the &quot;Ethiopian birr&quot;, although neither the country nor the currency changed beyond the name.

186 billion birr ($14.7 billion or €9.97 billion) were in circulation in 2008.

==History==
===First birr, 1855–1936===

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Maria Theresa thalers and blocks of salt called &quot;amole tchew&quot; () served as currency in Ethiopia. The thaler was known locally as the &quot;birr&quot; (literally &#x27;silver&#x27; in Geʽez and Amharic) or &quot;talari&quot; (). The Maria Theresa thaler was officially adopted as the standard coin in 1855, although the Indian rupee and the Mexican dollar were also used in foreign trade.

The Ethiopian talari became the standard unit on 9 February 1893, and 200,000 were produced at the Paris Mint in 1894 for Menelik II. The talari, equivalent to the Maria Theresa thaler, was divided into 20 &quot;ghersh&quot; (also &quot;guerche&quot; or &quot;gersh&quot;, from the Ottoman &quot;qirsh&quot;) or 40 &quot;bessa&quot; (a small copper coin).

A new Ethiopian coinage appeared about 1903. The new silver birr maintained the same weight and fineness as the talari, but there was now a quarter-birr and a silver ghersh, the latter 1/16 the weight of the birr. The money of account then became 1 birr, equivalent to 16 ghersh or 32 bessa.

The Bank of Abyssinia was established in 1905 by Emperor Menelik and the European banking group behind the National Bank of Egypt; the bank was officially inaugurated by Menelik on 15 February 1906. The Ethiopian coinage gained acceptance only gradually, and the Bank of Abyssinia imported Maria Theresa thalers. By the time World War I broke out, the bank was still importing about 1,200,000 of these coins annually. The Bank of Abyssinia put banknotes into circulation in 1915. These notes were denominated &quot;birr&quot; in Amharic and &quot;thaler&quot; in English. They were used by merchants and foreigners but were not initially accepted generally. However, note circulation increased considerably after 1925.

Emperor Haile Selassie bought out the Bank of Abyssinia in 1931 for £235,000 in order to make it a purely Ethiopian institution. It was reorganized as the &quot;Bank of Ethiopia&quot;. At the same time, the currency was decimalized and token nickel and copper coins were introduced, the birr becoming equal to 100 &quot;metonnyas&quot; (often written &quot;matonas&quot;). The text on the banknotes appeared in Amharic, French, and English.

By the mid-1930s circulation consisted chiefly of Maria Theresa thalers and Menelik talaris.

===Italian lira, 1936–1941===
Not long after the Italian occupation and the attempted transformation of Ethiopia into Italian East Africa, the Italian lira was introduced on 15 July 1936 and Ethiopian banknotes were withdrawn from circulation at 3 lire per talari (birr). In an effort to increase the use of Italian paper money, the exchange rate for silver coins (Maria Theresa thalers) was raised to 4.50 lire, then to 5.00, and eventually, in stages, to 13.50. Still, many people kept their Ethiopian coins and banknotes.

Regular Italian coins and banknotes of Banca d&#x27;Italia circulated after 15 July 1936. Special notes with a red overprint were authorized for Italian East Africa on 12 September 1938, and a large quantity was printed. It is not clear, however, when, where, and to what extent these special notes actually circulated.

===East African shilling, 1941–1945===
During the East African Campaign of 1941, British forces brought with them Indian, Egyptian, British, and British East African currency, and all were received in official payments. Italian coins and notes of up to 50 lire were allowed to continue in circulation to serve as small change; higher denominations were withdrawn at a rate of 24 lire per shilling. Maria Theresa thalers were allowed to circulate with a value of 1 shilling and pence (or 45 lire). The East African shilling became the money of account on 1 July 1942; it eventually became the sole legal tender and remained so until 1945.

Regular notes of the East African Currency Board were used for circulation in Ethiopia.

===Second birr, 1945–present===
The birr was reintroduced on 23 July 1945 at a rate of 1 birr per 2 shillings. It was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a central rate of 1 birr = US$0.4025, or 2.48447 birr = US$1. On 31 December 1963, this was slightly changed to 2.50 birr = US$1.

The name &quot;Ethiopian dollar&quot; was used in the English text on the banknotes. It was divided into 100 santims (derived from the French &quot;centime&quot;). Birr became the official name, used in all languages, in 1976.

====2024 birr floating====

In 2024, Ethiopia undertook reforms, including the liberalization of its foreign exchange market, leading to the floating of the Ethiopian Birr. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) spearheaded this initiative, receiving $13.5 billion from international partners to support the transition. This funding, primarily from multilateral lenders like the IMF and World Bank, aimed to the adoption of a flexible exchange rate system. Concurrently, Ethiopia secured over $15 billion in financial support from the World Bank, including direct grants, debt extensions, and investment commitments. The Ethiopian Birr experienced a substantial decline, falling 63% against the US dollar within a week of floating. The government&#x27;s introduction of a floating exchange rate led to a volatile period, with the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and private banks rapidly adjusting their foreign exchange rates. The exchange rate as indicated by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) is plummeted from 57 birr per US dollar a week ago to the 106 birr per dollar.

====Proposed birr symbol====
There have been various proposals for a birr symbol, mostly based on the Geez fidel ብ (&quot;bə&quot;). One suggested symbol comprises the &quot;bə&quot; with two horizontal slashes on the left hand side.

==Coins==
===First birr===
Between 1894 and 1897 copper coins were introduced in denominations of and birr, together with silver 1 ghersh, , , and 1 birr, and gold , and 1 werk. In 1931, a new series of coins was introduced consisting of copper 1 and 5 metonnyas, and nickel 10, 20 and 50 metonnyas.

===Second birr===
In 1944 (EE1936 in the Ethiopian calendar), coins were reintroduced, with copper 1, 5, 10 and 25 santim and silver 50 santim coins. A second series was issued in 1977 (EE1969). It consisted of aluminium 1 santim, brass 5 and 10 santim, cupro-nickel 25 and 50 santim, and bi-metallic 1 birr coins. The most recent issues are:
* 5 santim 2006 (EE1998)
* 10 santim 2004 (EE1996)
* 25 santim 2016 (EE2008; also called &quot;semuni&quot;)
* 50 santim 2016 (EE2008)
* 1 birr 2016 (EE2008)

The dates, like the rest of the legend, appear in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.

===Identification and appearance===
Besides having almost all text in Amharic, there are two features that help to immediately identify an Ethiopian birr. Coins dated before 1977 (EE1969) feature the Conquering Lion of Judah (a crowned rampant lion holding a cross). This can be seen in the adjacent picture. Coins dated 1977 (EE1969) or later picture the head of a roaring lion, with a flowing mane.

Coins were struck at several mints, including Paris, Berlin, and Addis Ababa. Coins without mint marks were generally struck at Addis Ababa. The coins struck at Paris have either the mintmark &quot;A&quot; with the cornucopia and fasces privy marks, or the cornucopia and torch privy marks without the &quot;A&quot;.

==Banknotes==

===First birr===
The Bank of Abyssinia introduced banknotes for 5, 10, 100 and 500 talaris in 1915, and 280,000 talaris worth of notes were printed. The text on the notes was in Amharic and French. A 50-talari note was added in 1929, by which time over 1.5 million talaris in notes were circulating.

The Bank of Ethiopia issued notes in 1932 in denominations of 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 talaris. A 2-talari note dated 1 June 1933 was issued in honour of the Imperial couple. By the end of 1934, some 3.3 million talaris in notes were circulating.

===Second birr===

On 23 July 1945, notes were introduced by the Bank of Ethiopia in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 birrs. The National Bank of Ethiopia was established by imperial proclamation 207 of 27 July 1963, and began operation on 1 January 1964. The National Bank of Ethiopia took over note production in 1966 and issued all denominations except for the 500 birr.

Banknotes have been issued in the following series:

===2020 denominations===
On 14 September 2020, Ethiopia announced the introduction of new banknotes of 10, 50, 100, and 200 birrs, with the latter being issued as a high denomination note to tackle inflation. Older issues of 10, 50, and 100 birr notes were demonetized in December. The federal government reported that over 113 billion birrs ($3.6 billion) remain hidden from the banks. The federal government also believes this money is being used as a catalyst to the current instability in Ethiopia. In just a month, Ethiopian banks took in 14 billion birrs (around $500 million) into their system, which is expected to increase towards the end of 2020. The measure, announced by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, was reported as a preventative measure against hoarding, counterfeiting and other corruption affecting the economy. He also noted that the country spent 3.7 billion birrs ($101.2 million) to print the new banknotes. Companies and individuals can only cash up to 1.5 million birrs ($41,000). The cash withdrawal from banks should also not exceed 100,000 birrs ($2,737). The old 5-birr notes, while they will remain legal tender, will be replaced with a coin.

<text>James Gardner March (January 15, 1928 – September 27, 2018) was an American political scientist, sociologist, and economist. A professor at Stanford University in the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Stanford Graduate School of Education, he is best known for his research on organizations, his (jointly with Richard Cyert) seminal work on A Behavioral Theory of the Firm, and the organizational decision making model known as the Garbage Can Model.

==Early life and education==

Born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1928, March received his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1945 in political science. He received his M.A. in 1950 and Ph.D. in 1953 from Yale University, both in political science.

==Career==
From 1953 to 1964, he had served on the faculties of the Carnegie Institute of Technology as a senior research fellow and assistant professor, and later professor of industrial administration and psychology.

For the academic year of 1955–56, March was a Political Science Fellow at the Stanford University Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

From 1964 to 1970, March joined the faculty at the University of California, Irvine as the founding Dean of the School of Social Sciences (1964–69). He was also a professor of psychology and sociology.

In 1970, March moved to Stanford University. At Stanford, he held several titles, including professor of political science and sociology, David Jacks Professor of Higher Education (1970–1978), professor of management (1978–1979), Fred H. Merrill Professor of Management (1979–1992), Jack Steele Parker Professor of International Management (1992–present). He had also served as a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution (1978–1987) and the founding director of the Scandinavian Consortium for Organizational Research (Scancor) (1989–1999).

He had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the National Academy of Education, and had been a member of the National Science Board. He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

He interacted and communicated in many different forms as books, articles, interactive seminars, films and poetry.

==Contributions==
March was highly respected for his broad theoretical perspective which combined theories from psychology and other behavioural sciences. As a core member of the Carnegie School, he collaborated with the cognitive psychologist Herbert A. Simon on several works on organization theory.

March was also known for his seminal work on the behavioural perspective on the theory of the firm along with Richard Cyert (1963).

In 1972, March worked together with Johan Olsen and Michael D. Cohen on the systemic-anarchic perspective of organizational decision making known as the Garbage Can Model.

The scope of his academic work was broad but focused on understanding how decisions happen in individuals, groups, organizations, companies and society. He explores factors that influences decision making, such as risk orientation, leadership and the ambiguity of the present and the past; politics and vested interests by stakeholders; the challenges of giving and receiving advice; the challenges of organizational and individual learning and the challenges of balancing exploration and exploitation in organizations.

==Awards==
March received numerous awards, including:
* 1968 Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal, Yale University
* 1984 Scholarly Contributions to Management Award (Irwin Award), Academy of Management
* 1995 Walter J. Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching, Stanford University
* 1997 John Gaus Award from the American Political Science Association

<text>Francis Gore, (1769 – 3 November 1852) was an English military officer and British colonial administrator in Bermuda and Upper Canada.

Gore was born in Blackheath, London, England in 1769 the son of Francis Gore and Caroline Beresford. Francis Gore senior was also a soldier and colonial administrator. Gore Sr became a governor of the West Indies in 1763. He had served in the Portuguese campaign of 1761 as aide-de-camp to Queen Charlotte&#x27;s brother.

Gore was commissioned as an ensign into the 44th Foot in 1787 directly from school at Durham, advancing in 1793 to lieutenant. Gore transferred to the 54th Foot in 1794 and the 17th Light Dragoons in 1795. He retired with the rank of major and became Governor of Bermuda from 1805 to 1806, and then Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada from 1806 to 1811. Gore&#x27;s administration built roads, reorganised the militia and founded schools.

Gore was absent on leave during the War of 1812 while military authorities ran Upper Canada. His stand-in during this time was Isaac Brock, who &quot;sought an active role in the impending war as keenly as Gore sought to escape it&quot;.

Gore resumed his role as lieutenant-governor from 1815 to 1817. During his second term, Gore prorogued the Legislative Assembly after it challenged his ban on issuing land grants to American refugees and made other criticisms of his administration. Robert MacIntosh, in his book &quot;Earliest Toronto&quot;, describes Gore as &quot;a man who was clearly the most incompetent and disliked Lieutenant Governor in the history of Upper Canada&quot;. Gore left Canada after his posting in 1817.

Gore married Annabella Wentworth, sister of Sir John Wentworth in 1803. They had no children. Gore died in Brighton, England, on 3 November 1852.

==Legacy==
Gore Vale, a north–south street on the eastern boundary of Trinity Bellwoods Park on the west side of downtown Toronto, is named after him. The lands of the park were at one time owned by Gore, who gave the ravine the name of &quot;Gore Vale&quot;. Most historians believe that the township municipality of Gore, Quebec, was named after him. Meyer&#x27;s Creek was renamed Belleville by United Empire Loyalist settlers in honour of his wife Lady Annabella Gore in 1816, after their visit to the settlement.

<doc id="650789" wikidata="Q7600592" url="?curid=650789" title="Star (game theory)">
<text>In combinatorial game theory, star, written as &#x27; or &#x27;, is the value given to the game where both players have only the option of moving to the zero game. Star may also be denoted as the surreal form . This game is an unconditional first-player win.

Star, as defined by John Conway in &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;, is a value, but not a number in the traditional sense. Star is not zero, but neither positive nor negative, and is therefore said to be &quot;fuzzy&quot; and &quot;confused with&quot; (a fourth alternative that means neither &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;equal to&quot;, nor &quot;greater than&quot;) 0. It is less than all positive rational numbers, and greater than all negative rationals.

Games other than {0 | 0} may have value ∗. For example, the game formula_1, where the values are nimbers, has value ∗ despite each player having more options than simply moving to 0.

==Why ∗ ≠ 0==
A combinatorial game has a positive and negative player; which player moves first is left ambiguous. The combinatorial game 0, or { | }, leaves no options and is a second-player win. Likewise, a combinatorial game is won (assuming optimal play) by the second player if and only if its value is 0. Therefore, a game of value ∗, which is a first-player win, is neither positive nor negative. However, ∗ is not the only possible value for a first-player win game (see nimbers).

Star does have the property that the sum , has value 0, because the first-player&#x27;s only move is to the game ∗, which the second-player will win.

==Example of a value-∗ game==
Nim, with one pile and one piece, has value ∗. The first player will remove the piece, and the second player will lose. A single-pile Nim game with one pile of &quot;n&quot; pieces (also a first-player win) is defined to have value ∗&quot;n&quot;. The numbers ∗&quot;z&quot; for integers &quot;z&quot; form an infinite field of characteristic 2, when addition is defined in the context of combinatorial games and multiplication is given a more complex definition.

<doc id="650792" wikidata="Q301355" url="?curid=650792" title="Classic Maya language">
<text>Classic Maya (or properly Classical Chʼoltiʼ) is the oldest historically attested member of the Mayan language family. It is the main language documented in the pre-Columbian inscriptions of the classical period of the Maya civilization. It is also the common ancestor of the Cholan branch of the Mayan language family. Contemporary descendants of classical Maya include Chʼol and Chʼortiʼ. Speakers of these languages can understand many Classic Mayan words.

Classic Maya is quite a morphologically binding language, and most words in the language consist of multiple morphemes with relatively little irregularity. It shows some regional and temporal variations, which is completely normal considering the long period of use of the language. Even so, the texts make it clear that it is a single, uniform language. Classical Maya shows ergative alignment in its morphology, as well as syntactically in focus constructs. Although the descendant Cholan languages limit this pattern of ergative alignment to sentences in completive aspect, classical Mayan does not show evidence of split ergativity.

Its spoken form, the Chʼoltiʼ, from the Manche Chʼol region, is known from a manuscript written between 1685 and 1695, first studied by Daniel Garrison Brinton. This language has become of particular interest for the study of Mayan glyphs, since most of the glyphic texts are written in the classical variety of Chʼoltiʼ, known as Classical Maya by epigraphers, which is believed to have been spoken as a prestigious language form throughout the Maya region during the classic period.

== History ==
During the Classic Period, the main branches of Proto-Mayan began to diversify into separate languages. The division between Proto-Yucatecan (in the north, the Yucatán Peninsula) and Proto-Cholan (in the south, the Chiapas highlands and the Petén Basin) had already occurred in the Classic, when most of the Mayan inscriptions existing were written. Both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at Maya sites of the time, and both are commonly known as the &quot;classical Mayan language&quot;.

Although a single prestigious language was by far the most frequently recorded in extant hieroglyphic texts, evidence of at least three different varieties of Maya has been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus: an Eastern Ch&#x27;olan variety found in texts written in the southern Maya area and the highlands, a western Ch&#x27;olan variety spread from the Usumacinta region from the mid-7th century onwards, and a Yucatecan variety found in texts from the Yucatan Peninsula. The reason that only a few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that they served as prestigious dialects throughout the Maya region; hieroglyphic texts would have been written in the language of the elite.

Stephen Houston, John Robertson, and David Stuart have suggested that the specific variety of Chʼolan found in most southern lowland glyphic texts was a language they called &quot;classical Chʼoltiʼ,&quot; the ancestor language of the Chʼortiʼ languages and modern Chʼoltiʼ. They propose that it originated in the western and south-central basin of the Petén, and that it was used in inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests. However, Mora-Marín has argued that the traits shared by the Classic Lowland Maya and Chʼoltian languages are retentions rather than innovations, and that the diversification of Chʼolan is indeed Post-Classical. The language of the classical lowland inscriptions would then have been Proto-Cholan.

== Relationships ==
It is now thought that the codices and other Classic texts were written by scribes, usually members of the Maya priesthood, in a literary form of the Chʼoltiʼ language. It is possible that the Maya elite spoke this language as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; over the entire Maya-speaking area, but also that texts were written in other Mayan languages of the Petén and Yucatán, especially Yucatec. There is also some evidence that the Maya script may have been occasionally used to write Mayan languages of the Guatemalan Highlands. However, if other languages were written, they may have been written by Chʼoltiʼ scribes, and therefore have Chʼoltiʼ elements.

== Writing system ==

Classic Maya is the principal language documented in the writing system used by the pre-Columbian Maya, and is particularly represented in inscriptions from the lowland regions in Mexico and the period c. 200—900. The writing system (generally known as the Maya script) has some similarities in function (but is not related) to other logosyllabic writing systems such as the cuneiform originating in Sumer, in which a combination of logographic and syllabic signs (graphemes) are used. The script&#x27;s corpus of graphemes features a core of syllabic signs which reflect the phonology of the Classic Maya language spoken in the region and at that time, which were also combined or complemented by a larger number of logograms. Thus the expressions of Classic Maya could be written in a variety of ways, represented either as logograms, logograms with phonetic complements, logograms plus syllables, or in a purely syllabic combination. For example, in one common pattern many verb and noun roots are given by logographs, while their grammatical affixes were written syllabically, much like the Japanese writing system.

== Phonology ==
The classical Maya consonant system can be represented as follows:

The Latin alphabet of the classical Maya transliteration is: ’, a, b, ch, ch’, e, h, i, k, k’, l, m, n, o, p, p’, s, t, t’, tz, tz’, u, w, x, y. It is the romanization system currently used by epigraphers to transcribe the language. However, the first alphabet was developed by Fray Francisco Morán in his &quot;Vocabulario en lengua choltí&quot;, whose most notable difference is the transcription of /k’/ as ⟨ꜫ⟩ and /t͡ʃ’/ as ⟨ꜫh⟩.

In Classic Maya, there are five vowels: a, e, i, o, u. Long vowels are written double: aa, ee, ii, oo, uu. Furthermore, no word begins with a vowel; these actually begin with a glottal stop. Because of this, the initial letter ’ is often omitted to facilitate transcription and alphabetic structuring.

The most widespread phonological process attested in Maya glyphs is the elimination of the underlying vowels in a trisyllabic word. When a sequence of the form CVCVCVC appears as a single word, the second vowel (the nucleus of the second syllable) is elided to form two CVC syllables. Examples: &quot;CHUM(mu)-la-ja&quot; &#x27;he sits&#x27; is transcribed &quot;chumlaj&quot;. &quot;AJAW-le-le&quot; &#x27;lordship&#x27; is transliterated &quot;ajawlel&quot;. &quot;Tu-’u-B’AAH&quot; &#x27;in itself&#x27; is transcribed &quot;tu’b’aah&quot;. &quot;Sa-ku-WINIK-ki&quot; &#x27;elder brother&#x27; is transliterated &quot;saku(n) winik&quot;.

== Grammar ==
Like most other Mayan languages, Classic Maya is verb–subject–object and is an ergative–absolutive language. Being polysynthetic, it uses both prefixes and suffixes to show grammatical function. Nouns are not inflected for case or gender. There is also an entire class of intransitives that convey the object&#x27;s spatial position. In addition, the language employs counter words when quantifying nouns and uses a vigesimal number system. 
Verbs are not conjugated according to tense, but rather are semantically altered by a series of aspect particles.

=== Numerals ===
Linguists and epigraphers still debate the accurate reading of classical Maya numerals. Numbers greater than 20 are recorded in classical Mayan inscriptions, as part of the so-called &quot;lunar series&quot;, for example, when describing the number of days that a &quot;lunar month&quot; specifically has (for example, &quot;20 + 9&quot;; &quot;20 + 10&quot;) or the count or order of dynasties to be counted.

List of numerals:
* (0)
* (1)
* / (2)
* / (3)
* / (4)
* (5)
* (6)
* / (7)
* (8)
* / (9)
* (10)
* / (11)
* / (12)
* / (13)
* / (14)
* (15)
* (16)
* / (17)
* (18)
* / (19)
* / (20).

=== Pronouns ===
Classic Maya pronouns come in two forms, &quot;dependent&quot; and &quot;independent&quot;.

Independent pronouns stand alone in an utterance, usually to draw focus to one of the sentence&#x27;s arguments; historically they were constructed from a demonstrative particle *&quot;haʔ&quot; plus a dependent pronoun of the Absolutive Series, but many of the attested forms display further unpredictable phonological developments. Dependent pronouns are affixed to their grammatical head (whether noun, adjective, or verb), and come in two separate sets. Ergative dependent pronouns--which mark the subject of a transitive verb, the possessor in a possessive construction, or the person of a relational noun (see below)--are prefixed to the root, with two allomorphs depending on whether the following root begins with a consonant (C) or with a vowel (V). Absolutive pronouns, on the other hand, are suffixed to the root; these mark the object of transitive verbs as well as the subject of both intransitive and stative verbs.

Because most major Classic Maya inscriptions take the form of narratives, first- and second-person pronouns are very rare, to the point that some forms - notably second-person plural pronouns - are not known at all. Such unattested forms are marked below with question marks.

=== Verbs ===
Many verbal roots of classical Maya have been attested. Some of these are:
* &quot;ak&quot;&#x27; – give
* &quot;al&quot; – speak
* &quot;cha&quot;&#x27; – do
* &quot;tz&#x27;ib&quot; – write, paint
* &quot;ch&#x27;ab&quot;- / &quot;kob&quot;&#x27; – create
* &quot;ch&#x27;am&quot; – receive
* &quot;hul&quot; – arrive
* &quot;pok&quot; – wash
* &quot;chum&quot; – sit
* &quot;jel&quot; – change
* &quot;il&quot; – see
* &quot;k&#x27;at&quot; – want
* &quot;och&quot; – enter, give of eat 
* &quot;pitz&quot; – play ball 
* &quot;way&quot; – sleep, transform 
* &quot;k&#x27;ay&quot; – sing 
* &quot;tal&quot; – come 
* &quot;nak&quot; – conquer 
* &quot;pas&quot; – open 
* &quot;pay&quot; – guide 
* &quot;tzutz&quot; – finish

=== Nouns ===
Unlike verbs and positionals, most nouns do not require morphological derivation. For these words, the morpheme used to derive non-possessed forms is the suffix -&quot;Vl&quot;, although the vowel for these can vary from word to word, and some words take a suffix -&quot;is&quot; or -&quot;aas&quot;. Examples: &quot;u-ch’ahb’&quot; &#x27;his penance&#x27; &gt; &quot;ch’ahb’-il&quot; &#x27;penance&#x27;, &quot;y-ohl&quot; &#x27;his heart from him&#x27; &gt; &quot;ohl-is&quot; &#x27;heart&#x27;. On the other hand, other nouns are generally not possessed and require derivation when possessed, usually with the abstract suffix -V (V) l. This is written with the syllabic sign -&quot;li&quot;, but it can have two allomorphs that are mostly phonologically conditioned, -&quot;il&quot; for CVC roots and -&quot;aal&quot; for non-CVC roots. The exceptions to this appear to be lexically determined. Example: &quot;lakam-tuun&quot; &#x27;wake&#x27; &gt; u &quot;lakam-tuun-il&quot; &#x27;his wake&#x27;.

== Literature ==
Maya literature is among the oldest in the world, spanning two millennia from pre-Columbian antiquity to the present. The Maya used to draw and write on some surfaces that were not intended to be a means of graphic expression. The most abundant preserved works of this type are found within rooms of buildings whose ceilings and walls are preserved. The only place where significant effort has been made to document writing on surfaces is Tikal, Guatemala.

From the period of classical Mayan writing, which lasted from the 3rd century BC until the 13th century, the texts that have survived to the present day were painted or carved in stones, bones, resistant wood, ceramics, shells or stucco. It is possible that much more had also been written on paper, but what little has come to this day is illegible. In places dating from the Classic Period, remains of books have been found in tombs, which would have been placed in chests or next to the heads of their deceased owners. There are only four still readable books that have survived to the present time.

<text>Alan Albert (born Alan Aufrichtig in Brooklyn, New York) is a sportscaster, who formerly called basketball games for the New York Nets and Denver Nuggets, national NBA and NHL coverage for the USA Network. He was also a play-by-play sportscaster for the Indiana Pacers. He has also worked in boxing, as the blow-by-blow announcer for &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot;.

==Education==
Albert obtained his degree from Ohio University, where he played hockey and lacrosse. He played goalie for both sports. Albert was invited to training camp by the New York Rangers and ended up playing a single season for the Toledo Blades.

==Career==
Albert started his broadcasting career in Denver, working for a local broadcasting company called KOA and also KHOW radio and KWGN-TV. He also served as a sports anchor on WNBC in New York City and was the voice of the New York Nets and New York Islanders. He was the voice for the Nuggets for 21 years until he decided to leave Denver in 1996. In 1999, he joined the Indiana Pacers as a play-by-play man. He worked there until 2007.

On January 24, 1984, Albert, working for USA network, called what Syracuse fans call the greatest game in the Carrier Dome ever. Syracuse faced Boston College, and the teams were tied 73–73 after a missed free throw by Boston College&#x27;s Martin Clark. Sean Kerins passed the rebound to Pearl Washington who took three steps and made a half court shot to win the game. Albert&#x27;s call lives on as The Greatest Play-by-Play Call in the Carrier Dome ever: &quot;Washington, two seconds, OHHHH! &#x27;The Pearl&#x27; hits it ..at midcourt.&quot; Syracuse University basketball fans call that the greatest nine words in Syracuse history.

==Awards and honors==
In 1995, he won the Sam Taub Award for excellence in boxing broadcasting journalism.

<text>In combinatorial game theory, the zero game is the game where neither player has any legal options. Therefore, under the normal play convention, the first player automatically loses, and it is a second-player win. The zero game has a Sprague–Grundy value of zero. The combinatorial notation of the zero game is: { | }.

A zero game should be contrasted with the star game {0|0}, which is a first-player win since either player must (if first to move in the game) move to a zero game, and therefore win.

==Examples==
Simple examples of zero games include Nim with no piles or a Hackenbush diagram with nothing drawn on it.

==Sprague-Grundy value==

The Sprague–Grundy theorem applies to impartial games (in which each move may be played by either player) and asserts that every such game has an equivalent Sprague–Grundy value, a &quot;nimber&quot;, which indicates the number of pieces in an equivalent position in the game of nim. All second-player win games have a Sprague–Grundy value of zero, though they may not be the zero game.

For example, normal Nim with two identical piles (of any size) is not the zero game, but has value 0, since it is a second-player winning situation whatever the first player plays.
It is not a fuzzy game because first player has no winning option.

<text>The Manchester Grammar School (MGS) is a highly selective private day school for boys aged 7-18 in Manchester, England, which was founded in 1515 by Hugh Oldham (then Bishop of Exeter). It is the largest private day school for boys in the United Kingdom and has been described as “one of Britain’s most prestigious independent day schools”, known for its strong academic focus; having educated politicians, leading journalists, diplomats, Nobel laureates, poets, as well as Academy Award and BAFTA award-winning actors and directors.
Originally named ‘The Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys’, The Manchester Grammar School was founded by Hugh Oldham in 1515 adjacent to Manchester Parish Church as a free grammar school and as the first school in Manchester. The school grounds slowly expanded for over 400 years until 1931, when the school successfully raised a sum to move its premises from a now over-crowded site in the centre of Manchester to its much larger present site at Rusholme. In accordance with its founder&#x27;s wishes, MGS remains a predominantly academic school and belongs to the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

In the post-war period, MGS was a direct-grant grammar school. It chose to become an independent school in 1976 after the Labour government abolished the Direct Grant System. Fees for 2023-2024 were £15,180 per annum, possibly now more after the Labour government removed private schools&#x27; charitable status.

==History==
===Foundation===

The founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended Exeter College, Oxford and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, after having been tutored in the house of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured protégé of Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of Henry VII, and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed Bishop of Exeter in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the River Irk near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school&#x27;s endowment.

On 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was £218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.

The original deed promoted &quot;Godliness and good learning&quot; and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between Manchester Cathedral, then a collegiate church, and the church&#x27;s domestic quarters, subsequently Chetham&#x27;s School of Music.

Later, Oldham&#x27;s great friend Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Winchester, wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found Corpus Christi College in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of Brasenose College, Oxford.

===Early history===
The original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester&#x27;s Parish Church and two graduates (the &#x27;High Master&#x27; and the &#x27;Usher&#x27;) to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.

In 1654, the world&#x27;s first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church&#x27;s living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) Humphrey Chetham, which also served to create a bluecoat orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.

By the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to Oxford and Cambridge. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started Latin, and another master was employed to teach them.

The 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.

By 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.
Going from the Old Church to Long Millgate ... one is in an almost undisguised working men&#x27;s quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness ... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.
A commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester&#x27;s business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its &#x27;feoffees&#x27; (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.

The area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, Victoria Railway Station was completed opposite the school and the church became Manchester Cathedral. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by Alfred Waterhouse, and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge&#x27;s purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham&#x27;s gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.

The tenure of Michael George Glazebrook as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil Ernest Barker: a system of prefects to keep order, the singing of school songs conducted by John Farmer, and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.

===Recent history===

By the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.

In 1930 the school moved out of the city centre to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in Rusholme, off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.

Both of the school&#x27;s earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the Second World War, the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, Chetham&#x27;s School of Music was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham&#x27;s took over the premises.

After the Education Act 1944, MGS became a direct grant grammar school, which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the Labour government – in the person of Education Secretary Shirley Williams – abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well-off pupils.

When the Assisted Places Scheme was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS set up a &quot;Bursary Appeal&quot;. This has accumulated a value of over £17.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (£12,930 per annum in 2019/20). Scholarships are not awarded.

In 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the Bursary Appeal and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.

The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot; (&quot;Dare to be Wise&quot;), which was also the motto of the council of the former County Borough of Oldham (now, with the same coat of arms, the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham), granted on 7 November 1894. &quot;Sapere aude&quot; is a quotation from Horace, famously used by Immanuel Kant and also the motto of the Enlightenment.

The Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word &quot;dom&quot; on it. This is a heraldic &quot;canting&quot; reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as &quot;owl-dom&quot;. This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as &quot;Ow[l]dem&quot;. Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the Borough of Oldham.

There is possibly a second significance to the &quot;dom&quot; of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for &quot;Deo Optimo Maximo&quot; meaning &quot;To God, the Best and the Greatest&quot;, a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God&#x27;s hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

The Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.

== Buildings ==
=== Main building ===

The main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and Percy Worthington. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J. L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices.

The main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J. G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.

Since opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation as indicated below.

==== Mason building ====
This is the school&#x27;s language department, named after P. G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school&#x27;s Sixth Form block, with construction beginning in 1965. The foundation stone was laid by The Queen on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.

==== Marks building ====
Named after former pupil Simon Marks, son of Michael Marks, founder of the Marks &amp; Spencer empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of £50,000 from Lord Marks) and the Israel Sieff Lecture Theatre (after a gift of £5,000 from Lord Marks&#x27; brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962. It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils – before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is on the first floor of the Marks building.

====Theatres and drama ====
Sieff Theatre is named after former pupil, Israel Sieff, is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir Nicholas Hytner (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought Alan Bennett and the actors from &quot;The History Boys&quot; to launch the campaign in 2006.

==== Sports hall and rectory building====
The Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by Mike Atherton (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James&#x27;s Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.

==== Music school ====
Located at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and &#x27;60s as a bicycle shed.

=== Junior School buildings ===

In September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6, extended to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011. Boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from Estonia.

Junior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and most of Year 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 and one class of year 5 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge.

===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===
The school owns the Owls&#x27; Nest, a large hut situated in Disley, south of Manchester, near to Lyme Park. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a German bomb on 23 December 1940, and a replacement was provided in 1950. The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions.

==Curriculum and attainment==
The school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE. Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the IGCSE does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. 

The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005. In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level.

Subjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:

* Art and Design (GCSE)
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)
* Classical Greek (GCSE)
* Computer Science
* Drama (GCSE)
* English Language
* English Literature
* Electronics (GCSE)
* Geography
* History
* Latin (GCSE)
* Mathematics &amp; Further Mathematics (GCSE)
* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))
* Music
* Physics
* Religious Studies

All the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.

The school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.

==Publications==
There are three publications focusing on the school. &quot;Ulula&quot; is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. &quot;MGS News&quot; is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community. The &quot;New Mancunian&quot;, is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards. The name echoes the &quot;Old Mancunian&quot; which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.

Specialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.

==Old Mancunians – notable alumni==
The school&#x27;s alumni are called &quot;Old Mancunians&quot;, or informally &quot;Old Mancs&quot;, and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain Mike Atherton, former Lancashire Captain, Mark Chilton, and former Lancashire and England batsman, John Crawley, several notable writers, such as Thomas de Quincey, playwright Robert Bolt, author Alan Garner, after whom the school&#x27;s Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster Martin Sixsmith. Other Old Mancunians are John Charles Polanyi (b. 1929) who won the 1986 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, chemist Michael Barber, actors Ben Kingsley and Robert Powell, historians Michael Wood and Victor Kiernan, popular science writer Brian Clegg, concert organist Daniel Moult, comic Chris Addison, and cryptographers Clifford Cocks, Peter Twinn and Malcolm J. Williamson. Theatre director Nicholas Hytner and the pianist John Ogdon are Old Mancunians. Mathematician and Fields Medalist Sir Michael Atiyah was also educated at the school for two years. One of the first Indian poets of English language, Manmohan Ghose, is also an Old Mancunian.

<text>This is a list of national birds, including official birds of overseas territories and other states described as nations. Most species in the list are officially designated. Some species hold only an &quot;unofficial&quot; status. The column is marked as &quot;Yes&quot; only if the bird currently holds the position of the official national bird. Additionally, the list includes birds that were once official but are no longer, as well as birds recognized as national symbols or for other symbolic roles.

<text>Sh&#x27;or Yoshuv () is a Haredi yeshiva in Lawrence, New York. It was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Shlomo Freifeld, former &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; (&quot;dean of students&quot;) at Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin. The yeshiva was located in Far Rockaway from its inception until 2003, when it moved to its current location in Lawrence, New York. The yeshiva facilities include a large Bais Medrash, classrooms, English and Hebrew libraries, a gymnasium, a large hall for community events and dormitory accommodations.

==Student body==
The yeshiva accepts students from the age of 17 and older. Students enter the yeshiva with a diverse range of backgrounds and educational experience. The student body comes to Sh’or Yoshuv from the surrounding community as well as locations all over the world.

==Academics==

The yeshiva has both organized shiurim (lectures) and chaburas (peer groups) for the students and for the local community. The student divide their day into the traditional morning, afternoon and night study session (sedarim). A weekly Kollel on Sunday is geared towards members of the community.
