<text>WBEZ (91.5 FM) – branded &quot;WBEZ 91.5&quot; – is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to Chicago, Illinois, and primarily serving the tri-state region of the Chicago metropolitan area. It is owned by Chicago Public Media and is financed by listener contributions, corporate underwriting and some government funding. WBEZ is affiliated with both National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Radio Exchange (PRX). It also broadcasts content from American Public Media and the BBC World Service. It produces several nationally syndicated shows for public radio stations, including documentary program &quot;This American Life&quot;, and co-produces news and politics quiz program, &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; with NPR.

WBEZ has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 5,700 watts with its transmitter atop the John Hancock Center on North Michigan Avenue. It broadcasts over two HD Radio digital subchannels. It operates full-power repeaters WBEK (91.1 FM) in Kankakee and WBEQ (90.7 FM) in Morris, as well as several FM translators. WBEZ-HD2, carrying a user-generated content format focused on &quot;urban alternative music&quot; and branded &quot;Vocalo.org&quot;, is also relayed over WBEW (89.5 FM) in Chesterton, Indiana.

==History==
===Classroom instruction===
WBEZ was among the earliest FM stations in Chicago. first went on the air on April 7, 1943, carrying instructional programming for the Chicago Public Schools. However, initially only a few classrooms were able to tune in, because most did not have FM receivers. It originally broadcast at 42.5 MHz, before moving to 91.5 MHz in 1947.

Its transmitter was located atop Chicago&#x27;s Morrison Hotel and its studios were in the Builders Building. In 1949, the station&#x27;s transmitter was moved to Marshall Metropolitan High School in Chicago&#x27;s East Garfield Park neighborhood. As of 2021, it is atop the John Hancock Center.

===NPR affiliation===
In 1970, WBEZ joined National Public Radio as a charter member and began general programming outside of school hours. Initially, most programming outside of the instructional programs and NPR programs was jazz music. The Board of Education sold the station to the current license holders, the not-for-profit WBEZ Alliance, Inc., in 1990. In September 1995 the parent company and station moved from its old offices to its current location at Navy Pier.

The corporate name was changed in 2010 to Chicago Public Media, Inc. Torey Malatia, the general manager, stepped down in July 2013 after 20 years with the station. Goli Sheikholeslami, formerly of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, was appointed as CEO. She took office in April 2014. Goli Sheikholeslami left WBEZ to head New York Public Radio in fall 2019; Steve Edwards, back on staff at WBEZ since 2017, was named interim CEO as of the end of September 2019.

WBEZ broadcasts at 5,700 watts, which on paper is somewhat modest for an NPR member on the FM band. However, with its transmitter being located atop Chicago&#x27;s second tallest building, its coverage area is largely comparable to Chicago&#x27;s major commercial FM stations. Even so, some inner suburbs such as Waukegan, Aurora and Elgin only get a grade B signal.

===Reduction in music programming===

On January 4, 2007, the station&#x27;s long-time overnight jazz programming was eliminated. The music program remaining on the schedule was the world music program &quot;Radio M&quot; (formerly &quot;Passport&quot; and in 2019 re-titled Radio Z) on Friday nights. All other music hosts were to be reassigned to other positions at the station, according to a March 2006 article in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. The replacement of music programming, which management said was due to the prevalence and popularity of other music delivery systems, caused outrage amongst many in the Chicago jazz scene. Protest sites were organized but were unsuccessful. Legendary jazz disc jockey Dick Buckley retained a time slot Sunday afternoons until mid-2008.

Station management announced a five-year plan for Chicago-oriented programs to cover all seven hours between the national news programs.

Other program changes happened in October 2012, with various programs being reshuffled. At the same time, &quot;Smiley and West&quot; from PRI was dropped from the Sunday afternoon line-up.

===Midday program change===
The last day WBEZ aired locally-produced international programming was October 4, 2019, with the final broadcast of &quot;Worldview&quot; with host Jerome McDonnell, which aired weekdays since 1994. The news on the hour at noon stopped being BBC news October 4, and started being NPR news on Monday October 7, 2019, the start of a week of transition.

A daytime hour of &quot;Newshour&quot; from the BBC World Service began Monday October 7, 2019, replacing &quot;The Morning Shift&quot;. Beginning Monday October 14, 2019, a new local talk show called &quot;Reset&quot; started. It was originally hosted by Jenn White. This was considered a shake-up of midday programs, which had not drawn as large an audience as the NPR morning and afternoon news programs, &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

==Programming==
Programming on WBEZ includes international news and local news including &quot;Curious City&quot;, world music, and quiz shows. Notable national programs offered by WBEZ include &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, &quot;Marketplace&quot;, &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;, &quot;PRI&#x27;s The World&quot; and &quot;Live From Here.&quot; Generally, news and talk programming is heard weekdays and evenings with music and entertainment talk programming on the weekends.

WBEZ is best known nationally as the producer of &quot;This American Life&quot; through Public Radio Exchange. &quot;This American Life&quot; began in 1995 as the local show &quot;Your Radio Playhouse&quot;; it was renamed in March 1996 and has been national since June 1996.

In addition, Chicago Public Media founded Third Coast International Audio Festival, a showcase for independent radio producers, and the producer of the weekly program &quot;Re:sound&quot;. WBEZ stopped broadcasting &quot;Re:sound&quot; circa 2019.&quot;.

WBEZ was also the flagship station of &quot;The Annoying Music Show!&quot;, a 3-minute program that showcased generally annoying songs. The program was produced by former WBEZ program director Jim Nayder. Nayder Communications also produced the somewhat more serious &quot;Magnificent Obsession,&quot; a program of interviews with persons who have overcome various addictions. The station was also once the flagship station of Steve Cushing&#x27;s nationally distributed Saturday night blues music program &quot;Blues Before Sunrise,&quot; which started in 1979 and has been independently produced and distributed by Cushing since 1995. &quot;Blues Before Sunrise,&quot; was eliminated from WBEZ&#x27;s lineup in the 2007 restructuring, but was taken over by public radio station WDCB in nearby Glen Ellyn.

Its morning magazine program &quot;Eight Forty-Eight&quot; was initially named after the postal address of the station, 848 East Grand Avenue. The show was renamed to &quot;The Morning Shift&quot;, and was dropped in October 2019 in favor of a two-hour local talk show midday, called &quot;Reset&quot;.

The corresponding afternoon program was called &quot;The Afternoon Shift&quot;. WBEZ touted the program as &quot;a live talk show featuring in-depth interviews and conversations with [mostly local] newsmakers, artists, writers, and innovators&quot;. Original host Steve Edwards left the station after a few months, and longtime &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; journalist Rick Kogan temporarily replaced him. As of 2013 and the conclusion of Kogan&#x27;s interim stint, WBEZ introduced Niala Boodhoo as the show&#x27;s permanent on-air host. In 2015, WBEZ canceled &quot;The Afternoon Shift&quot;; the final episode aired on June 5, 2015.

Another local program heard Monday through Friday was &quot;Worldview&quot;, a global issues program that began in 1986 as &quot;Midday with Sondra Gair&quot;. After Gair&#x27;s death in 1994, her producer Jerome McDonnell took over the program and hosted it since. It was heard nationally on Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s now-defunct PRI channel from Sirius&#x27; inception until 2006. Worldview aired its last program after 25 years on October 4, 2019.

Chicago Public Media is a founding member of the Public Radio Exchange (PRX), a programming cooperative for public radio stations and independent producers. The rock music talk show &quot;Sound Opinions,&quot; which moved from WXRT in 2005, was distributed nationally by American Public Media until 2010, when its distribution was transferred to PRX. PRX also distributes the film show &quot;Filmspotting&quot;.

News and news discussion/documentary programs aired on a weekly basis include Latino USA from NPR; Canadian CBC Radio shows &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Ideas&quot;, and &quot;Under the Influence with Terry O&#x27;Reilly&quot;; and &quot;Radio Netherlands: The State We&#x27;re In&quot;. Other programs that air weekly include &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; with Glynn Washington, a story-telling show from PRX and NPR.

== Satellites and translators ==
In addition to its main transmitter on 91.5 FM, WBEZ extends its signal by operating full-power satellite WBEQ/Morris, Illinois (90.7 FM). The station also formerly operated a low-power translator in Elgin, Illinois (W217BM at 91.3). In 2013, Chicago Public Media purchased 91.7 W219CD in Elgin from LifeTalk Radio for $52,500, and W217BM moved to Chicago the following year and changed its frequency to 91.1 as W216CL.

Listeners can also receive the broadcast online with streaming audio, MP3 download or by podcast. , the station drew an estimated 400,000 listeners each week.

Several other radio stations also are or were affiliated with Chicago Public Media.

<doc id="635785" wikidata="Q952347" url="?curid=635785" title="John Taylor Gatto">
<text>John Taylor Gatto (December 15, 1935 – October 25, 2018) was an American author and school teacher. After teaching for nearly 30 years he authored several books on modern education, criticizing its ideology, history, and consequences. He is best known for his books &quot;Dumbing Us Down: the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling&quot;, and &quot;The Underground History of American Education: A Schoolteacher’s Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling&quot; which criticize the modern education system and promote the concept of unschooling and a return to homeschooling.

==Biography==
Gatto was born to Andrew Michael Mario and Frances Virginia ( Zimmer) Gatto in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, a steel town near Pittsburgh. In his youth he attended public schools throughout the Pittsburgh Metro Area including Swissvale, Monongahela, and Uniontown as well as a Catholic boarding school in Latrobe. He did undergraduate work at Cornell, the University of Pittsburgh, and Columbia, then served in the U.S. Army medical corps at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Following army service he did graduate work at the City University of New York, Hunter College, Yeshiva University, the University of California, Berkeley, and Cornell.

By the late 1950s he worked as a copywriter scripting commercials in New York City. In the spring of 1960, he borrowed his roommate&#x27;s teaching license, went into Harlem to work as a substitute teacher. Gatto earned his teaching certificate in the summer of 1960. In 1963, he was hired as a fulltime 8th grade English teacher at Intermediate School 44 on New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side. Gatto moved on to Lincoln Academy (now Horizons Middle School) in 1981, which was considered a dumping ground for kids with behavior problems. Eventually Gatto found a position teaching predominantly poor, at-risk kids 8th grade students at Booker T. Washington Junior High in Spanish Harlem.

Gatto also ran for the New York State Senate, 29th District in 1985 and 1988 as a member of the Conservative Party of New York against incumbent David Paterson. He was named New York City Teacher of the Year in 1989, 1990, and 1991 and New York State Teacher of the Year in 1991. In 1991, he wrote a letter announcing his retirement, titled &quot;I Quit, I Think&quot;, to the op-ed pages of the &quot;Wall Street Journal,&quot; saying that he no longer wished to &quot;hurt kids to make a living.&quot; He then began a public speaking and writing career, and has received awards from libertarian organizations, including the &quot;Alexis de Tocqueville 1997 Award for Excellence in Advancement of Educational Freedom&quot;.

Gatto promoted homeschooling, and specifically unschooling and open source learning. 

Gatto was featured in the 2011 Evangelical Christian film &quot;IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America&quot;.

In 2011, Gatto had two major strokes which occurred after he completed the filming of &quot;The Ultimate History Lesson: A Weekend with John Taylor Gatto&quot; which was released in early 2012 by Tragedy and Hope Communications.

==Personal life==
Gatto was married to Janet (Gatto) with whom he spent half the year in New York City and the other half of the year at their farmhouse in upstate New York. 

==Main thesis==
Gatto asserts the following regarding what school does to children in &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot;:

# It confuses the students. It presents an incoherent ensemble of information that the child needs to memorize to stay in school. Apart from the tests and trials, this programming is similar to the television; it fills almost all the &quot;free&quot; time of children. One sees and hears something, only to forget it again.
# It teaches them to accept their class affiliation.
# It makes them indifferent.
# It makes them emotionally dependent.
# It makes them intellectually dependent.
# It teaches them a kind of self-confidence that requires constant confirmation by experts (provisional self-esteem).
# It makes it clear to them that they cannot hide, because they are always supervised.

Wade A. Carpenter, associate professor of education at Berry College, has called his books &quot;scathing&quot;, &quot;angry&quot; &quot;one-sided and hyperbolic, [but] not inaccurate&quot;. Ron Paul endorsed Gatto&#x27;s work. Gatto&#x27;s thesis contained neither sources nor peer-reviewed evidence to support his claims.

Gatto drew a contrast between communities and &quot;networks&quot;, with the former being healthy, and schools being examples of the latter. He says networks have become an unhealthy substitute for community in the United States.

He aimed to inspire education advocates and the inception of Praxis tests. This testing measured academic competence and knowledge of specific subjects required for teaching. Praxis tests are taken by potential educators as part of certification required by state and professional licensing entities.

In his essay &quot;Against School,&quot; Gatto purports to explain the apparent confusion and meaninglessness of public schooling system by exposing its alleged real purpose and function. Gatto references the six functions Alexander Inglis proposes in his 1918 book &quot;Principles of Secondary Education&quot;, though Gatto does not quote Inglis directly, instead giving his own interpretation of Inglis&#x27;s meaning.

<doc id="635790" wikidata="Q205650" url="?curid=635790" title="United Nations Human Rights Council">
<text>The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is a United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world. The Council has 47 members elected for staggered three-year terms on a regional group basis. The headquarters of the Council are at the United Nations Office at Geneva in Switzerland.

The Council investigates allegations of breaches of human rights in United Nations member states and addresses thematic human rights issues like freedom of association and assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of belief and religion, women&#x27;s rights, LGBT rights, and the rights of racial and ethnic minorities.

The Council was established by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March 2006 to replace the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR, herein CHR). The Council works closely with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and engages the United Nations special procedures. The Council has been strongly criticized for including member countries that engage in human rights abuses.

==Structure==
The members of the General Assembly elect the members who occupy 47 seats of the Human Rights Council. The term of each seat is three years, and no member may occupy a seat for more than two consecutive terms. The previous CHR had a membership of 53 countries elected by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) through a majority of those present and voting.

===Sessions===
The UNHRC holds regular sessions three times a year, in March, June, and September. The UNHRC can decide at any time to hold a special session to address human rights violations and emergencies, at the request of one-third of the member states. , there had been 36 special sessions.

===Members===

The Council consists of 47 members, elected yearly by the General Assembly for staggered three-year terms. Members are selected via the basis of equitable geographic rotation using the United Nations regional grouping system. Members are eligible for re-election for one additional term, after which they must relinquish their seat. United Nations member states outside the Council serve as observer states.

The seats are distributed along the following lines:
* 13 for the African Group
* 13 for the Asia-Pacific Group
* 6 for the Eastern European Group
* 8 for the Latin American and Caribbean Group
* 7 for the Western European and Others Group

===Suspensions===
The General Assembly can suspend the rights and privileges of any Council member that it decides has persistently committed gross and systematic violations of human rights during its term of membership. The suspension process requires a two-thirds majority vote by the General Assembly. The resolution establishing the UNHRC states that &quot;when electing members of the Council, Member States shall take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto&quot;, and that &quot;members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights&quot;.

Under those provisions, and in response to a recommendation made by the Council&#x27;s members, on 1 March 2011 the General Assembly voted to suspend Libya&#x27;s membership in the light of the situation in the country in the wake of Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s &quot;violent crackdown on anti-government protestors&quot;; Libya was reinstated as a Council member on 18 November 2011. 

On 7 April 2022, just days after photographic and video material of the Bucha massacre emerged, the eleventh emergency special session of the General Assembly suspended Russia from the council due to the gross and systematic violations of human rights committed during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Deputy Permanent Representative Gennady Kuzmin said that Russia had withdrawn from the council earlier in the day in expectation of the vote. Russia was only the second Human Rights Council member to be suspended from the UN body, after Libya in 2011, and it was the first permanent member of the UN Security Council to be suspended from any United Nations body.

===Directly responsible subsidiary bodies===

====Universal Periodic Review Working Group====
An important component of the Council consists of a periodic review of all 193 UN member states, called the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The mechanism is based on reports coming from different sources, one of them being contributions from non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Each country&#x27;s situation will be examined during a three-and-a-half-hour debate.

The first cycle of the UPR took place between 2008 and 2011, the second cycle between 2012 and 2016, and the third cycle began in 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2021.

The General Assembly resolution establishing the Council provided that &quot;the Council shall review its work and functioning five years after its establishment&quot;. The main work of the review was undertaken in an Intergovernmental Working Group established by the Council in its Resolution 12/1 of 1 October 2009. The review was finalized in March 2011, by the adoption of an &quot;Outcome&quot; at the Council&#x27;s 16th session, annexed to Resolution 16/21.

First cycle: The following terms and procedures were set out in General Assembly Resolution 60/251:
* Reviews are to occur over a four-year period (48 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2008 and 2011;
* The order of review should follow the principles of universality and equal treatment;
* All Member States of the Council will be reviewed while they sit at the Council and the initial members of the Council will be first;
* The selection of the countries to be reviewed must respect the principle of equitable geographical allocation;
* The first Member States and the first observatory States to be examined will be selected randomly in each regional group to guarantee full compliance with the equitable geographical allocation. Reviews shall then be conducted alphabetically.

Second cycle: HRC Resolution 16/21 brought the following changes:
* Reviews are to occur over a four-and-a-half-year period (42 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2012 and 2016;
* The order of review will be similar to the 1st cycle;
* The length of each Review will be extended from three to three-and-a-half hours;
* The second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the recommendations.

Similar mechanisms exist in other organizations: International Atomic Energy Agency, Council of Europe, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, and the World Trade Organization.

====Advisory Committee====
The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights was the main subsidiary body of the CHR. The Sub-Commission was composed of 26 elected human rights experts whose mandate was to conduct studies on discriminatory practices and to make recommendations to ensure that racial, national, religious, and linguistic minorities are protected by law.

In 2006, the newly created UNHRC assumed responsibility for the Sub-Commission. The Sub-Commission&#x27;s mandate was extended for one year (to June 2007), but it met for the final time in August 2006. At its final meeting, the Sub-Commission recommended the creation of a Human Rights Consultative Committee to provide advice to the UNHRC.

In September 2007, the UNHRC decided to create an Advisory Committee to provide expert advice with 18 members, distributed as follows: five from African states; five from Asian states; three from Latin American and Caribbean states; three from Western European and other states; and two members from Eastern European states.

====Complaint procedure====
The UNHRC complaint procedure was established on 18 June 2007 (by UNHRC Resolution 5/1) for reporting of consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world and under any circumstances.

The UNHRC set up two working groups for its Complaint Procedure:

* the &quot;Working Group on Communications&quot; (WGC) – consists of five experts designated by the Advisory Committee from among its members, one from each regional group. The experts serve for three years with the possibility of one renewal. The experts determine whether a complaint deserves investigation, in which case it is passed to the WGS.
* the &quot;Working Group on Situations&quot; (WGS) – has five members, appointed by the regional groups from among its members on the Council for one year, which is renewable once. The WGS meets twice a year for five working days to examine the communications transferred to it by the WGC, including the replies of states thereon, as well as the situations which are already before the UNHRC under the complaint procedure. The WGS, on the basis of the information and recommendations provided by the WGC, presents the UNHRC with a report on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and makes recommendations to the UNHRC on the course of actions to take.

;Filing a complaint

The Chairman of the WGC screens complaints for admissibility. A complaint must be in writing, and cannot be anonymous. Examples provided by the UNHRC of cases that would be considered consistent patterns of gross human rights violations include alleged deterioration of human rights of people belonging to a minority, including forced evictions, racial segregation and substandard living conditions, and alleged degrading situation of prison conditions for both detainees and prison workers, resulting in violence and death of inmates. Individuals, groups, or NGOs can claim to be victims of human rights violations or that have direct, reliable knowledge of such violations.

Complaints can be regarding any state, regardless of whether it has ratified a particular treaty. Complaints are confidential and the UNHRC will only communicate with the complainant, unless it decides that the complaint will be addressed publicly.

The interaction with the complainant and the UNHRC during the complaints procedure will be on an as-needed basis. UNHRC Resolution 5/1, paragraph 86, emphasizes that the procedure is victims-oriented. Paragraph 106 provides that the complaint procedure shall ensure that complainants are informed of the proceedings at the key stages. The WGC may request further information from complainants or a third party.

Following the initial screening a request for information will be sent to the state concerned, which shall reply within three months of the request being made. WGS will then report to the UNHRC, which will usually be in the form of a draft resolution or decision on the situation referred to in the complaint.

The UNHRC will decide on the measures to take in a confidential manner as needed, but this will occur at least once a year. As a general rule, the period of time between the transmission of the complaint to the state concerned and consideration by the UNHRC shall not exceed 24 months. Those individuals or groups who make a complaint should not publicly state the fact that they have submitted a complaint.

To be accepted complaints must:
* be in writing and submitted in one of the six UN official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish);
* contain a description of the relevant facts (including names of alleged victims, dates, location, and other evidence), with as much detail as possible, and shall not exceed 15 pages;
* not be manifestly politically motivated;
* not be exclusively based on reports disseminated by mass media;
* not be already dealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body, or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights;
* be after domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless it appears that such remedies would be ineffective or unreasonably prolonged;
* not use a language that is abusive or insulting.
The complaint procedure is not designed to provide remedies in individual cases or to provide compensation to alleged victims.

;Effectiveness

Due to the confidential manner of the procedure, it is almost impossible to find out what complaints have passed through the procedure and also how effective the procedure is.

There is a principle of non-duplication, which means that the complaint procedure cannot take up the consideration of a case that is already being dealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights.

On the UNHRC website under the complaints procedure section there is a list of situations referred to the UNHRC under the complaint procedure since 2006. This was only available to the public as of 2014, however generally does not give any details regarding the situations that were under consideration other than the state that was involved.

In some cases the information is slightly more revealing, for example a situation that was listed was the situation of trade unions and human rights defenders in Iraq that was considered in 2012, but the UNHRC decided to discontinue that consideration.

The complaints procedure has been said to be too lenient due to its confidential manner. Some have often questioned the value of the procedure, but 94% of states respond to the complaints raised with them.

The OHCHR receives between 11,000 and 15,000 communications per year. During 2010–11, 1,451 out of 18,000 complaints were submitted for further action by the WGC. The UNHRC considered four complaints in their 19th session in 2012. The majority of the situations that have been considered have since been discontinued.

History shows that the procedure works almost in a petition like way; if enough complaints are received then the UNHRC is very likely to assign a special rapporteur to the state or to the issue at hand. It has been said that an advantage of the procedure is the confidential manner, which offers the ability to engage with the state concerned through a more [diplomatic] process, which can produce better results than a more adversarial process of public accusation.

The procedure is considered by some a useful tool to have at the disposal on the international community for situations where naming and shaming has proved ineffective. Also another advantage is that a complaint can be made against any state, regardless of whether it has ratified a particular treaty.

Due to the limited information that is provided on the complaints procedure it is hard to make comments on the process itself, the resources it uses versus its effectiveness.

====Other subsidiary bodies====
In addition to the UPR, the Complaint Procedure, and the Advisory Committee, the UNHRC&#x27;s other subsidiary bodies include:

*&quot;Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&quot;, which replaced the CHR&#x27;s Working Group on Indigenous Populations
*&quot;Forum on Minority Issues&quot;, a platform for promoting dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to national or ethnic, religious, and linguistic minorities
*&quot;Social Forum&quot;, a space for dialogue between the representatives of Member States, civil society, including grass-roots organizations, and intergovernmental organizations on issues linked with the national and international environment needed for the promotion of the enjoyment of all human rights by all. It was established in 1997 in response to concerns regarding the impact of globalization on the realization of economic, social, and cultural rights. The appointment of Iran as Chair of the 2023 HRC Social Forum, which focused on &quot;the contribution of science, technology, and innovation to promoting human rights, including in the context of post-pandemic recovery&quot;, drew condemnation.
===Special procedures===
&quot;Special procedures&quot; is the general name given to the mechanisms established by the Human Rights Council to gather expert observations and advice on human rights issues in all parts of the world. Special procedures are categorized as either thematic mandates, which focus on major phenomena of human rights abuses worldwide, or country mandates, which report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories. Special procedures can be either individuals (called &quot;special rapporteurs&quot; or &quot;independent experts&quot;), who are intended to be independent experts in a particular area of human rights, or working groups, usually composed of five members (one from each UN region). As of August 2017 there were 44 thematic and 12 country mandates.

The mandates of the special procedures are established and defined by the resolution creating them. Various activities can be undertaken by mandate-holders, including responding to individual complaints, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation, and engaging in promotional activities. Generally the special procedures mandate-holders report to the Council at least once a year on their findings.

====Special procedures mandate-holders====
Mandate-holders of the special procedures serve in their personal capacity, and do not receive pay for their work. The independent status of the mandate-holders is crucial to be able to fulfill their functions in all impartiality. The OHCHR provides staffing and logistical support to aid each mandate-holders in carrying out their work.

Applicants for Special Procedures mandates are reviewed by a Consultative Group of five countries, one from each region. Following interviews by the Consultative Group, the Group provides a shortlist of candidates to the UNHRC President. Following consultations with the leadership of each regional grouping, the President presents a single candidate to be approved by the Member states of the UNHRC at the session following a new mandate&#x27;s creation or on the expiration of the term of an existing mandate holder.

Country mandates must be renewed yearly by the UNHRC; thematic mandates must be renewed every three years. Mandate-holders, whether holding a thematic or country-specific mandate, are generally limited to six years of service.

====Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression====
The amendments to the duties of the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, passed by the Human Rights Council on 28 March 2008, gave rise to sharp criticism from western countries and human rights NGOs. The additional duty is phrased thus:

:(d) To report on instances in which the abuse of the right of freedom of expression constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination, taking into account articles 19 (3) and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which stipulates that the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression
(quoted from p. 67 in the official draft record of the council). The amendment was proposed by Egypt and Pakistan and passed by 27 votes to 15 against, with three abstentions with the support of other members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, China, Russia, and Cuba. As a result of the amendment over 20 of the original 53 co-sponsors of the main resolution – to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur – withdrew their support, though the resolution was carried by 32 votes to 0, with 15 abstentions. &quot;Inter alia&quot; the delegates from India and Canada protested that the Special Rapporteur now has as his/her duty to report not only infringements of the rights to freedom of expression, but in some cases also employment of the rights, which &quot;turns the special rapporteur&#x27;s mandate on its head&quot;.

Outside the UN, the amendment was criticised by organizations including Reporters Without Borders, Index on Censorship, Human Rights Watch, and the International Humanist and Ethical Union, all of whom share the view that the amendment threatens freedom of expression.

In terms of the finally cast votes, this was far from the most controversial of the 36 resolutions adapted by the 7th session of the Council. The highest dissents concerned combating defamation of religions, with 21 votes for, 10 against, and 14 abstentions (resolution 19, pp. 91–97), and the continued severe condemnation of and appointment of a Special Rapporteur for North Korea, with votes 22–7 and 18 abstentions (resolution 15, pp. 78–80). There were also varying degrees of dissent for most of the various reports criticising Israel; while on the other hand a large number of resolutions were taken unanimously without voting, including the rather severe criticism of Myanmar (resolutions 31 and 32), and the somewhat less severe on Sudan (resolution 16).

==Israel and Palestine==

The mandate of the UNHCR&#x27;s Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories is to investigate human rights violations by Israel. This is because under international humanitarian law (IHL), as applied by the UNHRC, Israel is considered the occupying power in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), and therefore has the obligation of upholding human rights throughout the territories which the special rapporteur is tasked with investigating its adherence to. This was affirmed in an October 2023 report by the UNHCR&#x27;s s Francesca Albanese. A July 2024 landmark opinion by the UN&#x27;s top court, the International Court of Justice, also reaffirmed this, while stating that Israel should dismantle settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and end its &quot;illegal&quot; occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.

===2006 creation of Agenda Item 7===
The Council voted on 30 June 2006 to review the &quot;Human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories&quot;.

The council voted on 30 June 2006 to make a review of alleged human rights abuses by Israel a permanent feature of every council session. The Council&#x27;s special rapporteur on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is its only expert mandate with no year of expiry, due to the ongoing nature of the occupation. The resolution, which was sponsored by Organisation of the Islamic Conference, passed by a vote of 29 to 12 with five abstentions. 

===April 2009: Gaza report===
On 3 April 2009, South African Judge Richard Goldstone was named as the head of the independent United Nations Fact-Finding Mission to investigate international human rights and humanitarian law violations related to the Gaza War. The Mission was established by Resolution S-9/1 of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

On 15 September 2009, the UN Fact-Finding mission released its report which found that there was evidence &quot;indicating serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza conflict, and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes, and possibly crimes against humanity&quot;. The mission also found that there was evidence that &quot;Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes, as well as possibly crimes against humanity, in their repeated launching of rockets and mortars into Southern Israel&quot;. The mission called for referring either side in the conflict to the UN Security Council for prosecution at the International Criminal Court if they refuse to launch fully independent investigations by December 2009.

Goldstone has since partially retracted the report&#x27;s conclusions that Israel committed war crimes, as new evidence has shed light upon the decision making by Israeli commanders. He said, &quot;I regret that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes.&quot;
===July 2015: resolution===
On 3 July 2015, UNHRC voted Resolution A/HRC/29/L.35 &quot;ensuring accountability and justice for all violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem&quot;. It passed by 41 votes in favor including the eight sitting EU members (France, Germany, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Latvia and Estonia), one against (the United States) and five absentions (India, Kenya, Ethiopia, Paraguay and the Republic of Macedonia). India explained that its abstention was due to the reference to International Criminal Court (ICC) in the resolution whereas &quot;India is not a signatory to the Rome Statute establishing the ICC&quot;.

===2018 onwards===
On 9 July 2021, Michael Lynk, the Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, addressing a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank amount to a war crime, and calling on countries to inflict a cost on Israel for its illegal occupation. Israel, which does not recognize Lynk&#x27;s mandate, boycotted the session.

On 21 March 2022, Lynk submitted a report, stating that Israel&#x27;s control over the West Bank and Gaza Strip amounts to apartheid, an &quot;institutionalised regime of systematic racial oppression and discrimination&quot;. The Israeli Foreign Ministry and other Israeli and Jewish organizations labelled Lynk as hostile to Israel and the report baseless.

Following the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the council voted on 27 May 2021 to set up a United Nations fact-finding mission to investigate possible war crimes and other abuses committed in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. The commission will report to the Human Rights Council annually from June 2022. Unlike previous fact finding missions the inquiry is open ended and will examine &quot;all underlying root causes of recurrent tensions, instability and protraction of conflict, including systematic discrimination and repression based on national, ethnic, racial or religious identity.&quot;

===Accusations of bias against Israel===
Human Rights Watch agreed that the deteriorating situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories should be considered by the Council, and urged it to look at international human rights and humanitarian law violations committed by Palestinian armed groups as well, which the Council has done. HRW also called on the Council to avoid the selectivity that discredited its predecessor and urged it to hold special sessions on other urgent situations, such as that in Darfur.

In 2006, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan argued that the UNHRC should not have a &quot;disproportionate focus on violations by Israel. Not that Israel should be given a free pass. Absolutely not. But the Council should give the same attention to grave violations committed by other states as well&quot;. 

On 20 June 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement that read: &quot;The Secretary-General is disappointed at the Council&#x27;s decision to single out only one specific regional item given the range and scope of allegations of human rights violations throughout the world.&quot; Ban Ki-moon also reiterated the importance of investigating and upholding international humanitarian law with respect to the Israeli occupied Palestinian territories, stating in 2016 that &quot;History proves that people will always resist occupation...Palestinian frustration and grievances are growing under the weight of nearly a half-century of occupation. Ignoring this won’t make it disappear. No one can deny that the everyday reality of occupation provokes anger and despair, which are major drivers of violence and extremism and undermine any hope of a negotiated two-state solution.&quot;

Former president of the Council Doru Costea, the European Union, Canada, the United States and Britain have at various times accused the UNHRC of focusing disproportionately on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank.

Speaking at the IDC&#x27;s Herzliya Conference in Israel in January 2008, Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen criticized the actions of the Human Rights Council actions against Israel. &quot;At the United Nations, censuring Israel has become something of a habit, while Hamas&#x27;s terror is referred to in coded language or not at all. The Netherlands believes the record should be set straight, both in New York and at the Human Rights Council in Geneva&quot;, Verhagen said.

In 2008 UNHRC released a statement calling on Israel to stop its military operations in the Gaza Strip and to open the Strip&#x27;s borders to allow the entry of food, fuel and medicine. UNHRC adopted the resolution by a vote of 30 to 1, with 15 states abstaining.

&quot;Unfortunately, neither this resolution nor the current session addressed the role of both parties. It was regretful that the current draft resolution did not condemn the rocket attacks on Israeli civilians,&quot; said Canada&#x27;s representative Terry Cormier, the lone voter against.

The United States and Israel boycotted the session. U.S. ambassador Warren Tichenor said the Council&#x27;s unbalanced approach had &quot;squandered its credibility&quot; by failing to address continued rocket attacks against Israel. &quot;Today&#x27;s actions do nothing to help the Palestinian people, in whose name the supporters of this session claim to act,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;Supporters of a Palestinian state must avoid the kind of inflammatory rhetoric and actions that this session represents, which only stoke tensions and erode the chances for peace&quot;, he added. &quot;We believe that this council should deplore the fact that innocent civilians on both sides are suffering&quot;, Slovenian Ambassador Andrej Logar said on behalf of the seven EU states on the council.

At a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon responded when asked about its special session on Gaza, that &quot;I appreciate that the council is looking in-depth into this particular situation. And it is rightly doing so. I would also appreciate it if the council will be looking with the same level of attention and urgency at all other matters around the world. There are still many areas where human rights are abused and not properly protected&quot;, he said.

Dugard was succeeded in 2008 by Jewish Professor of international law Richard Falk, who has compared Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians with the Nazis&#x27; treatment of Jews during the Holocaust. After a conflict with the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s Mahmoud Abbas over his decision, under US pressure, to delay a UNHCR vote on Richard Goldstone&#x27;s report on violations of international humanitarian law during the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza war, widely criticized among Palestinians including calls on Abbas to stand down and the PA to be dissolved, Abbas informally asked Falk to resign, accusing him of being among other things &quot;a partisan of Hamas&quot;. Falk disputed this and called the reasons given &quot;essentially untrue&quot;, with the actual motivation behind his call on Abbas to cease his delaying of the UNHRC vote. The Israeli government announced it would deny Falk a visa to Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, at least until the September 2008 meeting of the UNHCR.

In July 2011, Richard Falk posted a cartoon that critics have described as anti-Semitic onto his blog. The cartoon depicted a bloodthirsty dog with the word &quot;USA&quot; on it wearing a kippah, or Jewish head covering. In response, Falk was heavily criticized by world leaders in the United States, certain European countries and Israel.

At UNHRC&#x27;s opening session in February 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized the council&#x27;s &quot;structural bias&quot; against the State of Israel: &quot;The structural bias against Israel – including a standing agenda item for Israel, whereas all other countries are treated under a common item – is wrong. And it undermines the important work we are trying to do together.&quot;

In March 2012, the UNHRC was criticized for facilitating an event in the UN Geneva building featuring a Hamas politician. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu castigated the UNHRC&#x27;s decision stating, &quot;He represents an organization that indiscriminately targets children and grown-ups, and women and men. Innocents – is their special favorite target&quot;. Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the UN Ron Prosor denounced the speech stating that Hamas was an internationally recognized terrorist organization that targeted civilians. &quot;Inviting a Hamas terrorist to lecture to the world about human rights is like asking Charles Manson to run the murder investigation unit at the NYPD&quot;, he said.

The United States urged UNHRC in Geneva to stop its anti-Israel bias. It took particular exception to the council&#x27;s Agenda Item 7, under which at every session, Israel&#x27;s human rights record is debated. No other country has a dedicated agenda item. The US Ambassador to UNHRC Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe said that the United States was deeply troubled by the &quot;Council&#x27;s biased and disproportionate focus on Israel.&quot; She said that the hypocrisy was further exposed in the Golan Heights resolution that was advocated by the Syrian regime at a time when it was murdering its own citizens.

On 19 June 2018, the United States pulled out of the UNHRC accusing the body of bias against Israel and a failure to hold human rights abusers accountable. Nikki Haley, US Ambassador to the UN, called the organisation a &quot;cesspool of political bias&quot;. At UNHRC&#x27;s 38th Session on 2 July 2018, Western nations &quot;de facto&quot; boycotted Agenda Item 7 by not speaking to it. Israel had been condemned in 78 resolutions by the Council since its creation in 2006—more resolutions condemning Israel than the rest of the world combined.

==Other specific issues==
===Indigenous peoples (EMRIP)===

The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) was established by the Human Rights Council, in 2007, with its mandate amended in September 2016. This body provides the HRC with expert advice on the rights of indigenous peoples, and helps member states to achieve the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

===United States and UNHRC President===
The Council&#x27;s charter preserves the watchdog&#x27;s right to appoint special investigators for countries whose human rights records are of particular concern, something many developing states have long opposed. A Council meeting in Geneva in 2007 caused controversy after Cuba and Belarus, both accused of abuses, were removed from a list of nine special mandates. The list, which included North Korea, Cambodia and Sudan, had been carried forward from the defunct Commission. Commenting on Cuba and Belarus, the UN statement said that Ban noted &quot;that not having a Special Rapporteur assigned to a particular country does not absolve that country from its obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;

The United States said a day before the UN statement that the Council deal raised serious questions about whether the new body could be unbiased. Alejandro Wolff, US Deputy Permanent Representative at the United Nations, accused the council of &quot;a pathological obsession with Israel&quot; and also denounced its action on Cuba and Belarus. The UNHRC President Doru Costea said that he agreed with Wolff, saying that the functioning of the Council needed continuous improvement. He added that the Council must examine the behaviour of all parties involved in complex disputes and not place just one state under the magnifying glass.

===Defamation of religion===

From 1999 to 2011, the CHR and the UNHRC adopted resolutions in opposition to the &quot;defamation of religion&quot;.

===Climate change===

The Human Rights Council has adopted the Resolution 10/4 about human rights and climate change. At its 48th the Council in Resolution 13 (A/HRC/48/13) recognized the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.

===Responses to crises===
====2006: Lebanon conflict====
At its Second Special Session in August 2006, the Council announced the establishment of a High-Level Commission of Inquiry charged with probing allegations that Israel systematically targeted and killed Lebanese civilians during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. The resolution was passed by a vote of 27 in favour to 11 against, with 8 abstentions. Before and after the vote several member states and NGOs objected that by targeting the resolution solely at Israel and failing to address Hezbollah attacks on Israeli civilians, the Council risked damaging its credibility. The members of the Commission of Inquiry, as announced on 1 September 2006, were Clemente Baena Soares of Brazil, Mohamed Chande Othman of Tanzania, and Stelios Perrakis of Greece. The Commission noted that its report on the conflict would be incomplete without fully investigating both sides, but that &quot;the Commission is not entitled, even if it had wished, to construe [its charter] as equally authorizing the investigation of the actions by Hezbollah in Israel&quot;, as the Council had explicitly prohibited it from investigating the actions of Hezbollah.

====2015: Eritrea====

In June 2015, a 500-page UNHRC report accused Eritrea&#x27;s government of widespread human rights violations. These were alleged to include extrajudicial executions, torture, indefinitely prolonged national service and forced labour, and widespread sexual harassment, rape and sexual servitude by state officials. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the report &quot;catalogues a litany of human rights violations by the &#x27;totalitarian&#x27; regime of President Isaias Afwerki &#x27;on a scope and scale seldom witnessed elsewhere. The report also asserted that these serial violations might amount to crimes against humanity.

The Eritrean Foreign Ministry responded by describing the Commission&#x27;s report as &quot;wild allegations&quot;, &quot;totally unfounded and devoid of all merit&quot;, and countercharged the UNHRC with &quot;vile slanders and false accusations&quot;.

The vice chairperson of the subcommittee on human rights at the European Parliament said the report detailed &quot;very serious human rights violations&quot;, and said that EU funding for development would not continue as at present without change in Eritrea.

==== August 2018: Myanmar ====
In August 2018, the UNHRC released a research report concluding that six generals in Myanmar armed forces should be prosecuted for war crimes as related to the genocide against the Rohingya Muslims. The UNHRC conducted 875 individual interviews as part of this research, confirming that the Myanmar army led a pogrom that claimed the lives of more than 10,000 Rohingyas.

====2018–2019: Yemen====
A 2019 report for the UNHRC has said the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have committed war crimes during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

====November 2020: Egypt ====
The United Nations condemned the November 2020 arrest of three Egyptian human rights advocates of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). The activists were charged and detained for having a connection to terror groups. EIPR said the detention was a &quot;clear and co-ordinated response&quot; of their work against human rights violations in the country and the detention of the head of EIPR, Gasser Abdel-Razek, was an attempt to end the human rights work in Egypt.

==== 2022: Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine ====
The United Nations Human Rights Council voted 32–2 on 4 March 2022, with 13 abstentions, to create the International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, an independent committee of three human rights experts with a mandate to investigate alleged violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

At its eleventh emergency special session, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution, with the required two-thirds majority of voting members, to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council over reports of gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The measure required a two-thirds majority of the countries present and voting, not counting abstentions. The measure passed with 93 in favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions. After the suspension, Russia&#x27;s Deputy Permanent Representative, Gennady Kuzmin, announced that Russia had decided to withdraw its Human Rights Council membership altogether. Doing so, Russia restored its rights as an observer to participate in the council&#x27;s proceedings, while it lost the possibility to have its membership reinstated and to vote or present motions.

====November 2022: Iran====
On 24 November 2022, the council held a special session on the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran, in particular with regard to women and children.

====April 2024: Israel====
On 5 April 2024, the council held a special session on the deteriorating possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, in particular with regard to genocide in Gaza. The council voted in favour of a halt in all arms sales to Israel.
==Candidacy issues==
===Syria===

In July 2012, Syria announced that it would seek a UNHRC seat. This was while there was serious evidence (provided by numerous human rights organizations including the UN itself) that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had authorised and funded the slaughter of thousands of civilians, with estimates of 14,000 civilians being killed as of July 2012 during the Syrian civil war. According to UN Watch, Syria&#x27;s candidacy was virtually assured under the prevailing election system. Syria would have been responsible for promoting human rights if elected. In response, the United States and European Union drafted a resolution to oppose the move. In the end, Syria was not on the ballot for the 12 November 2012 election to UNHRC.

===Sudan and Ethiopia===

In July 2012, it was reported that Sudan and Ethiopia were nominated for a UNHRC seat, despite being accused by human rights organizations of grave human rights violations. UN Watch condemned the move to nominate Sudan, pointing out that Sudan&#x27;s President Omar Al-Bashir was indicted for genocide by the International Criminal Court. According to UN Watch, Sudan was virtually assured of securing a seat. A joint letter of 18 African and international civil society organizations urged foreign ministers of the African Union to reverse its endorsement of Ethiopia and Sudan for a seat, accusing them of serious human rights violations and listing examples of such violations, and stating that they should not be rewarded with a seat. Sudan was not on the ballot for the 12 November 2012 election to UNHRC, but Ethiopia was elected.

===Saudi Arabia===

In September 2015, Faisal bin Hassan Trad, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, was elected Chair of the UNHRC Advisory Committee, the panel that appoints independent experts. UN Watch executive director Hillel Neuer said: &quot;It is scandalous that the UN chose a country that has beheaded more people this year [2015] than ISIS to be head of a key human rights panel. Petro-dollars and politics have trumped human rights.&quot; Saudi Arabia also shut down criticism, during the UN meeting. In January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr who had called for free elections in Saudi Arabia.

On 13 October 2020, Saudi Arabia lost its bid to win a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and China were competing for membership in a five-way race for four spots with Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Nepal. China received 139 votes, Uzbekistan 164, Pakistan 169 votes, and Saudi Arabia came in fifth with 90 votes, beaten by Nepal with 150 votes. Human Rights Watch condemned the candidacy filed by China and Saudi Arabia, calling them &quot;two of the world&#x27;s most abusive governments&quot;.

===Venezuela===

When the UN General Assembly voted to add Venezuela to the UN Human Rights Council in October 2019, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft wrote: &quot;I am personally aggrieved that 105 countries voted in favor of this affront to human life and dignity. It provides ironclad proof that the Human Rights Council is broken, and reinforces why the United States withdrew.&quot; Venezuela had been accused of withholding from the Venezuelan people humanitarian aid delivered from other nations, and of manipulating its voters in exchange for food and medical care. The council had been criticized regularly for admitting members who were themselves suspected of human rights violations.

==Country positions==

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka came under increasing scrutiny in early 2012 after a presentation of a draft UNHRC resolution addressing their accountability with regard to their reconciliation activities, a resolution which was subsequently tabled by the United States. The original draft resolution from the United States noted the UNHRC &quot;concern that the LLRC [Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission] report [did] not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international law&quot;. The UNHRC resolution then:
::&quot;1. Calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the constructive recommendations in the LLRC report and take all necessary additional steps to fulfill its relevant legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans,
::2. Requests that the Government of Sri Lanka present a comprehensive action plan as expeditiously as possible detailing the steps the Government has taken and will take to implement the LLRC recommendations and also to address alleged violations of international law,
::3. Encourages the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant special procedures to provide, and the Government of Sri Lanka to accept, advice and technical assistance on implementing those steps and requests the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to present a report to the Council on the provision of such assistance at its twenty-second session.&quot;

Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva Tamara Kunanayakam pointed out that 80% of the UNHRC&#x27;s funding requirements are supplied by powerful nations such as the United States and its allies. Also, key positions in the UNHRC are mostly held by those who have served in the foreign services of such countries. Sri Lanka&#x27;s position is that this fact is significantly detrimental to the impartiality of the UNHRC activities, especially when dealing with the developing world. As a result, Sri Lanka, along with Cuba and Pakistan, sponsored a resolution seeking transparency in funding and staffing the UNHRC, during its 19th session starting in February 2012. The resolution was adopted on 4 April 2012.

The original US UNHRC draft resolution that prompted the Sri Lankan, Cuban, and Pakistani transparency initiative was thereafter significantly modified, and passed in 2013. Narayan Lakshman, writing from Washington, D.C. for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, said the United States &quot;watered down&quot; the resolution, while UN Watch described the revised resolution as &quot;toned down&quot;. Lakshman noted that &quot;an entire paragraph calling for &#x27;unfettered access&#x27;... by a host of external observers and specialists was deleted&quot;, and the reworded resolution&#x27;s demand for international investigation into &quot;alleged human rights violations&quot; was elevated but then &quot;veer[ed] off towards an apparent preference for Sri Lanka to conduct its own internal investigation&quot;. He noted that in general &quot;weaker language has been inserted in place of more condemnatory tone&quot;. The revised resolution remained entitled &quot;Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka&quot; and was assigned UN code &quot;A/HRC/22/L.1/Rev.1&quot;. As finally submitted, the U.S. resolution was co-sponsored by 33 countries, including three other members of the U.N. Security council at that time (the UK, France, and Germany), and four other European nations (Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland). By a vote of 25 in favor—which included the resolution sponsors and other EU countries, as well as South Korea—and 13 against, the resolution was adopted on 21 March 2013 (with nine countries abstaining or absent).

===United States===
The 43rd U.S. President George W. Bush declared that the United States would not seek a seat on the Council, saying it would be more effective from the outside. He did pledge, however, to support the Council financially. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said, &quot;We will work closely with partners in the international community to encourage the council to address serious cases of human rights abuse in countries such as Iran, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma, Sudan, and North Korea&quot;.

The U.S. State Department said on 5 March 2007 that, for the second year in a row, the United States had decided not to seek a seat on the Human Rights Council, asserting the body had lost its credibility with repeated attacks on Israel and a failure to confront other rights abusers. Spokesman Sean McCormack said the council had had a &quot;singular focus&quot; on Israel, while countries such as Cuba, Myanmar and North Korea had been spared scrutiny. He said that though the United States will have only an observer role, it will continue to shine a spotlight on human rights issues. The most senior Republican member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the U.S. House of Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, supported the administration decision. &quot;Rather than standing as a strong defender of fundamental human rights, the Human Rights Council has faltered as a weak voice subject to gross political manipulation,&quot; she said.

Upon passage of UNHRC&#x27;s June 2007 institution-building package, the U.S. restated its condemnation of bias in the institution&#x27;s agenda. Spokesman Sean McCormack again criticised the Commission for focusing on Israel in light of many more pressing human rights issues around the world, such as Sudan or Myanmar, and went on to criticise the termination of special rapporteurs to Cuba and Belarus, as well as procedural irregularities that prevented member-states from voting on the issues; a similar critique was issued by the Canadian representative. In September 2007, the US Senate voted to cut off funding to the council.

The United States joined with Australia, Canada, Israel, and three other countries in opposing the UNHRC&#x27;s draft resolution on working rules citing continuing misplaced focus on Israel at the expense of action against countries with poor human-rights records. The resolution passed 154–7 in a rare vote forced by Israel including the support of France, the United Kingdom, and China, although it is usually approved through consensus. United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke about the &quot;council&#x27;s relentless focus during the year on a single country – Israel,&quot; contrasting that with failure &quot;to address serious human rights violations taking place in other countries such as Zimbabwe, DPRK (North Korea), Iran, Belarus and Cuba.&quot; Khalilzad said that aside from condemnation of the crackdown of the Burmese anti-government protests, the council&#x27;s past year was &quot;very bad&quot; and it &quot;had failed to fulfill our hopes&quot;.

On 6 June 2008, &quot;Human Rights Tribune&quot; announced that the United States had withdrawn entirely from the UNHRC, and had withdrawn its observer status.

The United States boycotted the Council during the George W. Bush administration, but reversed its position on it during the Obama administration. Beginning in 2009 however, with the United States taking a leading role in the organization, American commentators began to argue that the UNHRC was becoming increasingly relevant.

On 31 March 2009, the administration of Barack Obama announced that it would reverse the country&#x27;s previous position and would join the UNHRC; New Zealand indicated its willingness not to seek election to the council to make room for the United States to run unopposed, along with Belgium and Norway for the WEOG seats.

On 19 June 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced that the United States, under President Donald Trump, was pulling out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, accusing the council being &quot;hypocritical and self-serving&quot;; in the past, Haley had accused it of &quot;chronic anti-Israel bias&quot;. &quot;When the Human Rights Council treats Israel worse than North Korea, Iran, and Syria, it is the Council itself that is foolish and unworthy of its name. It is time for the countries who know better to demand changes,&quot; Haley said in a statement at the time, pointing to the council&#x27;s adoption of five resolutions condemning Israel. &quot;The United States continues to evaluate our membership in the Human Rights Council. Our patience is not unlimited.&quot;

In December 2020, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said that the UN Human Rights Council was &quot;a haven for despots and dictators, hostile to Israel, and ineffectual on true human rights crises&quot;.

On 8 February 2021, following the election of Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the Biden administration would reengage with the UN Human Rights Council.

On 4 February 2025, President Trump reinstituted his policy and again withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council as part of a larger motion for &quot;ending U.S. support for radical anti-American UN organizations.&quot; A White House Fact sheet says the UN Human Rights Council &quot;has demonstrated consistent bias against Israel,&quot; and that it “has not fulfilled its purpose and continues to be used as a protective body for countries committing horrific human rights violations.&quot;

===China===
On 1 April 2020, China joined the United Nations Human Rights Council.

====China&#x27;s Xinjiang policies====

In July 2019, UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Spain, Germany, and Japan, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC condemning China&#x27;s mistreatment of the Uyghurs and other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the Xinjiang internment camps.

In response, UN ambassadors from 50 countries including Russia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, UAE, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Angola, Algeria, and Myanmar signed a joint letter to the UNHRC praising China&#x27;s &quot;remarkable achievements in Xinjiang&quot; and opposing the practice of &quot;politicizing human rights issues&quot;.

In August 2019, Qatar told the UNHRC president that it had decided to withdraw from the response letter. Human rights activists praised Qatar&#x27;s decision.

In October 2022, 17 countries voted in favor, 19 were against, and 11 abstained in a vote to hold a debate on Xinjiang at its next session, rejecting a Western bid to debate China’s Xinjiang abuses.

===Indonesia===
In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands raising human rights violations in the Western New Guinea, declared which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963, and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report. Indonesia rejected Vanuatu&#x27;s allegations. Also, a joint NGO statement was made. More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict.

The UNHRC expressed grave concern over ongoing human rights violations against the Papuan people in Indonesia, citing a lack of accountability and transparency in investigations, hindering reparations for victims. Recommendations were made to intensify efforts to combat impunity and prioritize investigations and reparations for victims.

===Israel===
On 6 February 2025, following the United States’ decision to withdraw, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar announced the withdrawal of Israel from the UN Human Rights Council.

==Criticism==
The United States opposed the creation of the UNHRC during the George W. Bush administration to protest the repressive states among its membership. In March 2009 the Obama administration reversed that position and decided to &quot;reengage&quot; and seek a seat on the UNHRC. With the United States taking a leading role in the organization, American commentators began to argue that the UNHRC was becoming increasingly relevant.

The UNHRC has been criticised for the repressive states among its membership. Countries with questionable human rights records that have served on the UNHRC include Pakistan, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, China, Indonesia, and Russia.

On 12 October 2021, the Human Rights Watch criticised UNHRC elections and stated that UN member countries should refrain from voting for Cameroon, Eritrea, United Arab Emirates, and other candidates as they hold abysmal rights records. These countries were alleged not to meet the qualifications for membership on the board. The UN director at Human Rights Watch, Louis Charbonneau said that electing such serious rights abusers sends a terrible message that the UN member states do not take the council&#x27;s fundamental mission to protect human rights seriously.

===Bloc voting===
A Reuters report in 2008 said that independent human rights groups say that UNHRC is being controlled by some Middle East and African nations, supported by China, Russia and Cuba, which protect each other from criticism. This drew criticism from the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the ineffectiveness of UNHRC, saying it had fallen short of its obligations. He urged countries to &quot;drop rhetoric&quot; and rise above &quot;partisan posturing and regional divides&quot; and get on with defending people around the world.

Of the 53 countries which defended China&#x27;s imposition of the Hong Kong National Security Law following the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, at least 43 were participants in the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, with one Axios reporter noting that &quot;Beijing has effectively leveraged the UN Human Rights Council to endorse the very activities it was created to oppose.&quot;

Ban Ki-moon also appealed for the United States to fully join the council and play a more active role.

The UNHRC was criticized in 2009 for adopting a resolution submitted by Sri Lanka praising its conduct in Vanni that year, ignoring pleas for an international war crimes investigation.

===Accountability programme===
On 18 June 2007, one year after holding its first meeting, the UNHRC adopted its &quot;Institution-building package&quot;, to guide it in its future work. Among its elements was the Universal Periodic Review, which assesses the human rights situations in all 193 UN member states. Another element is an &quot;Advisory Committee&quot;, which serves as the UNHRC&#x27;s &quot;think tank&quot; and provides it with expertise and advice on thematic human rights issues. A further element is a &quot;Complaint procedure&quot;, which allows individuals and organizations to bring complaints about human rights violations to the attention of the council.

<text>An inverted roller coaster is a type of steel roller coaster in which the train runs under the track with the seats directly attached to the wheel carriage. Riders are seated in open cars, letting their feet swing freely. The inverted coaster was pioneered by Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger &amp; Mabillard in the early 1990s with the development of , which opened at Six Flags Great America on May 9, 1992.

Versions of inverted coasters have since been produced by other major coaster manufacturers such as Vekoma and Intamin. Intamin has few designs classified as inverted coasters, although they do install inverted coaster trains on some of their launched designs. Vekoma, however, predominantly mass-produced the same design (Suspended Looping Coaster) with 41 identical coasters installed around the world, though Vekoma now markets a newer style of inverted coaster, the Suspended Thrill Coaster, which utilises lap-bar restraints instead of the traditional over-the-shoulder restraints. Vekoma was also the first manufacturer to install a family-friendly inverted roller coaster with the opening of Flying Ace Aerial Chase at Kings Island in 2001. Giovanola also has a single inverted coaster operating, which uses the box-track design, also used by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard.

The inverted coaster differs from the older suspended coaster, which runs under the track, but features cars that enclose the rider&#x27;s legs and lower body and are attached to the track above by a pivoting bar, whereas the trains on inverted coasters are directly attached to the track. This direct attachment facilitates inversions, which aren&#x27;t possible on suspended coasters. Inversions typically featured on inverted coasters include vertical loops, zero-g rolls, Immelmann loops, cobra rolls, and corkscrews, though Vekoma&#x27;s suspended loopers typically feature sidewinder and in-line twist elements.

==History==
The inverted coaster was developed in the early 1990s by engineers Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard of the Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger &amp; Mabillard in cooperation with engineer Robert Mampe and Jim Wintrode, at the time the general manager of Six Flags Great America, who first envisioned a suspended coaster capable of inversions. The result of this partnership, , soft opened at Six Flags Great America as the first inverted coaster in the world on May 2, 1992, officially opening on May 9, 1992. With the coaster&#x27;s success, Time Warner, Six Flags&#x27; parent company at the time, moved to construct a series of duplicates of the ride at various Six Flags parks. In 1993, a second installation of Batman: The Ride at Six Flags Great Adventure opened as the second inverted coaster in the world. Six Flags has since gone on to construct five additional duplicates of the ride.

The second unique inverted coaster was Flight Deck which opened in 1993 at California&#x27;s Great America as Top Gun. Nemesis Reborn was the first inverted coaster constructed outside the United States when it opened at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, England in 1994. That same year, Raptor opened at Cedar Point. With a 3,790-foot (1,160 m) track layout, Raptor was far larger and featured a less compact layout than its predecessors. It also featured the first cobra roll on an inverted coaster.

== Installations ==
231 inverted roller coasters have been installed at various theme parks, some of which have been relocated. The following list is not exhaustive and only shows the most notable installations.

<text>August Vincent Theodore Spies (, ; December 10, 1855November 11, 1887) was an American upholsterer, radical labor activist, and newspaper editor. An anarchist, Spies was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder following a bomb attack on police in an event remembered as the Haymarket affair. Spies was one of four who were executed in the aftermath of this event.

==Background==
Spies was born on December 10, 1855, in a ruined castle converted into a government building on the mountain Landeckerberg in the Electorate of Hesse, Germany. His father was a government forestry official.

Spies later recalled that he had a pleasant and privileged childhood, one filled with recreation and study. He was educated by private tutors and trained for a career following in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a government forester. His father died suddenly in 1871, however, ending the comfortable financial situation for his mother, and August determined to set out for a new life in America, a country in which he already had a number of financially successful relatives.

==In Chicago==
Spies settled in Chicago, where he became an upholsterer, involving himself in trade union activities. Due to the injustices he witnessed, Spies joined the Socialist Labour Party in 1877. He emerged as a leader of the SLP&#x27;s radical faction; this faction provoked a split in the party by parading through the streets in military uniforms and shouldering muskets. After the English-speaking section of the SLP attempted to combine with the reformist Greenback Labor Party in 1880, Spies helped engineer a takeover of the party&#x27;s executive committee and ousted the compromisers. When the national leadership of the SLP denounced the Chicago radicals and removed their newspaper the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; from its list of party organs, Spies led the formation of a revolutionary alternative to the SLP. In 1883, Spies was a leader in the Revolutionary Congress held in Pittsburgh that formally launched the International Working People&#x27;s Association in America.

Spies had joined the staff of the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; in 1880, becoming editor in 1884.

==Haymarket Square==
Speaking to a rally outside the McCormick Harvesting Machine Plant on May 3, 1886, Spies advised the striking workers to &quot;hold together, to stand by their union, or they would not succeed.&quot; Well-planned and coordinated, the general strike to this point had remained largely nonviolent. When the end-of-the-workday bell sounded, however, a group of workers surged to the gates to confront the strikebreakers. Despite calls by Spies for the workers to remain calm, gunfire erupted as police fired on the crowd. In the end, two McCormick workers were killed (although some newspaper accounts said there were six fatalities). Spies would later testify, &quot;I was very indignant. I knew from experience of the past that this butchering of people was done for the express purpose of defeating the eight-hour movement.&quot;

The next day, May 4, Spies spoke at the Haymarket Square rally. Violence erupted and a bomb was thrown. The blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of eight police officers and an unknown number of civilians. Seven men were arrested, including Spies. Later, Albert Parsons turned himself in.

Witnesses testified that none of the eight men charged threw the bomb. According to &quot;The Press on Trial&quot;, Spies had finished his speech but was still on stage when the bomb went off. However, all eight were found guilty, and seven were sentenced to death. One, Oscar Neebe, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

===Trial===

Spies was put on trial for conspiracy in the murder of Officer Mathias Degan with seven other men. The defense initially sought to split the defendants into two groups. Spies was to stand trial with three others (Michael Schwab, Samuel Fielden and Oscar Neebe), separated from the &quot;Monday Night Conspirators&quot; (Louis Lingg, George Engel and Adolph Fischer), the more extreme defendants alleged to have attended a planning meeting in the Greif&#x27;s Hall basement the night before the bombing. However, defense attorney William A. Foster shocked his colleagues and Spies by telling the judge the motion of severance musn&#x27;t delay the trial and was merely perfunctory. Spies passed a note to another attorney that read, &quot;What in the hell does Foster mean? I thought our motion was meant seriously.&quot;

Albert Parsons would later turn himself in and all eight defendants were tried as a group. Spies would maintain his innocence and, despite the costly courtroom mistake, showed solidarity with his comrades through the trial, appeals, and at the gallows.
Spies was one of three defendants, along with Lingg and Fischer, who were implicated in the possession of bombs. Spies testified he first obtained the dynamite out of curiosity. &quot;I wanted to experiment with dynamite just the same as I would take a revolver and go out and practice.&quot; He kept the explosives on hand to impress reporters. &quot;The reporters used to bother me a good deal, and they were always up for a sensation and when they came to the office I would show them these Giant cartridges... they would go away and write up some big sensational article.&quot; (Giant Powder was a brand of dynamite.)

During the trial, the jury was allowed by the judge to consider as evidence articles written by the defendants in support of political violence, conversations about their desire for revolution, and other past materials. On the stand, Spies confirmed he had received an 1884 letter from Johann Most, an anarchist author of a how-to pamphlet on dynamite. Most&#x27;s letter said he would proxy Spies 20 or 25lbs. of &quot;medicine&quot;, which prosecutors said was code for dynamite. In their appeal, the defense argued that police seized the letter from Spies&#x27; desk without a warrant, but the appellate judge said he could not pursue the matter because defense lawyers had not objected to the letter&#x27;s admission during the trial.

Gottfried Waller, a fellow anarchist, testified that at the meeting at Greif&#x27;s Hall, two of the Monday Night Conspirators agreed that the code word &quot;Ruhe&quot; would be published in the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; to call anarchists to arms. The word appeared in the newspaper&#x27;s &quot;Letterbox&quot; section on May 4, the day of the bombing. Theodore Fricke, the &quot;Arbeiter Zeitung&#x27;s&quot; bookkeeper, testified that Ruhe was written in the hand of August Spies. Malvern Thompson, a grocer, testified he observed Spies preparing for the Haymarket rally in Crane&#x27;s Alley, where he heard Spies ask Michael Schwab, &quot;Do you think one is enough, or hadn&#x27;t we better go and get more?&quot; and a reference to &quot;pistols&quot; and &quot;police&quot;. Thompson said he heard Schwab tell Spies, &quot;Now, if they come, we will give it to them.&quot;

Thompson said the two were joined by a third man who Thompson later identified as Rudolph Schnaubelt, the lead suspect as the bomb thrower and Schwab&#x27;s brother-in-law. Spies handed something to Schnaubelt, who stuffed it in his pocket, Thompson testified. Witness Harry Gilmer testified he saw Spies climb down from the wagon and light the fuse for the bomb thrown by Schnaubelt.

At his sentencing, Spies denounced the police and prosecution witnesses. &quot;There was no evidence produced by the State to show or even indicate that I had any knowledge of the man who threw the bomb, or that I myself had anything to do with the throwing of the missile, unless, of course, you weight the testimony of the accomplices of the State&#x27;s Attorney and (Inspector John) Bonfield, the testimony of Thompson and Gilmer, by the price they were paid for it.&quot;

Spies also charged that one witness, Gustav Legner, could prove his alibi but was threatened by police and paid to leave Chicago. Legner sued the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; for libel for repeating Spies&#x27; claim of bribery, denying he was told to leave town. Legner said he asked Spies before leaving the city if he should testify and was told he would not be needed. The &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; agreed to print a retraction.

In 1887, Spies and his co-defendants appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court (122 Ill. 1), then to the Supreme Court of the United States, where they were represented by John Randolph Tucker, Roger Atkinson Pryor, General Benjamin F. Butler and William P. Black. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari (writ of error) by unanimous decision (123 U.S. 131).

In January 1887, while still in prison, Spies married Nina van Zandt (1862–1936). She was a graduate of Vassar College and the only child of a wealthy Chicago chemist. She published an article on the trial for the Chicago Knights of Labor. After Spies&#x27; death she married Stephen A. Malato, an attorney, in 1895. They divorced in 1902, and she reverted to the surname Spies. Nina Spies died on April 12, 1936.

==Death and legacy==
Two of the defendants, Michael Schwab and Samuel Fielden, asked for clemency and their sentences were commuted to life in prison on November 10, 1887, by Governor Richard James Oglesby. They, together with Oscar Neebe, were pardoned and released on June 26, 1893, by John Peter Altgeld, the governor of Illinois.

Of the remaining five, Louis Lingg killed himself in his cell with a blasting cap concealed in a cigar on November 10, 1887. Spies, Albert Parsons, Adolph Fischer, and George Engel were hanged the next day, November 11, 1887.

As he faced his demise on the gallows, Spies shouted, &quot;The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today.&quot; The words are engraved on the &quot;Haymarket Martyrs&#x27; Monument&quot; in Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois, where Spies and the other Haymarket martyrs are buried.

May 1 was selected to celebrate International Workers&#x27; Day to commemorate the Haymarket affair.

<text>Osona () is a comarca situated in the central region of Catalonia, Spain. Its capital is Vic. Its population in 2001 was 129,543. Osona covers roughly the same area as the historic Catalan county of Osona. The name Osona comes from &quot;Ausetans&quot; (), a group of Iberian people who had their capital in &quot;Ausa&quot; (today Vic); the Romans called the area &quot;Ausone&quot; or &quot;Ausona&quot;. While most of the &quot;comarca&quot; is within the province of Barcelona, the municipalities of Espinelves, Vidrà and Viladrau form part of the province of Girona.

The most important town of Osona is Vic, its capital and an important and ancient urban center in this natural region that lies in the midst of the Plain of Vic. Other significant towns in the plain are Manlleu and Tona.

This natural depression in the center of the region was carved by river Ter and its tributaries and makes up a big part of Osona&#x27;s land. It is surrounded by mountains: The Sub-Pyrenees, with Bellmunt mountain towering in the north, the Lluçanès (Pre-Pyrenees) to the north-west and Moianès high plateau in the West, the Montseny in the southeast and the Guilleries, located at the apex of the Catalan Transversal Range and the Pre-Coastal Range, in the east. 

Long famous for its local sausages (especially &quot;fuet&quot;) and other pork derivatives, in recent years the area has become somewhat infamous for the pollution of its many waterways due to the factory farming of pigs and Dairy cattle. There are more pigs than people living in Osona. 

In the comarcal revision of 1990, Sant Quirze de Besora became part of Osona; previously it formed part of the Ripollès. In May 2015, Osona lost the municipality of Collsuspina to the new comarca of Moianès.

<text>The  (, &quot;Red Party&quot;; or , &quot;Democratic Party&quot;) was a political group that contested elections in the Eastern section of the Province of Canada. It was formed around 1847 by radical French-Canadians inspired by the ideas of Louis-Joseph Papineau, the &quot;Institut canadien de Montréal&quot;, and the reformist movement led by the of the 1830s.

The Red Party did not experience electoral success in the same manner as the Blue Party, their electoral rivals in Canada East. Because of their anti-clerical beliefs, the Red Party was condemned by the Catholic Church, contributing to their lack of electoral success. The party did form government as part of a coalition with the Clear Grits and Liberals from Canada West on some occasions before confederation, but never held a majority in their section of the province. After confederation, the party was dissolved, with members forming the Liberal Party of Canada at the federal level, and the Liberal Party of Quebec at the provincial level.

==History==
The party was a successor to the , a radical political movement in Lower Canada responsible for the rebellions of 1837–1838. The reformist rouges did not believe that the 1840 Act of Union had truly granted a responsible government to former Upper and Lower Canada. They advocated important democratic reforms, republicanism, and secularism (separation of the state and the church). They were perceived as anti-clerical and radical by their political adversaries. Some of its members desired the abolition of the semi-feudal seigneurial system of land ownership, although Papineau was himself a seigneur and a vocal defender of the traditional system, which he wanted reformed, not abolished.

The elected rouges typically allied with the Clear Grits in the legislature of the Province of Canada. The party primarily sat in opposition to the Liberal-Conservative-Bleu government that governed the province for most of the period between the fall of the reform movement and confederation. However, the rouges did form government with the Clear Grits once, after the fall of the Macdonald-Cartier ministry on a vote of non-confidence. This resulted in the shortest-lived government in Canadian history, falling four days after it was called by the Governor-General. After Confederation, its more moderate members (notably including Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who would become Canada&#x27;s first francophone Prime Minister) formed what became the Liberal Party of Canada in conjunction with their Upper Canadian Clear Grit allies.

== Ideology ==
The opposed the union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the United Province of Canada, and demanded its termination. When talks for Canadian confederation began, its members either opposed the idea, or suggested a decentralized confederation. Some elements of the party advocated for full sovereignty, or joining with the United States, for the French-speaking part of Canada. They were opposed to the ultramontane politics of the Catholic clergy of Quebec and the Parti bleu.

=== Manifestos ===
The Red Party published the following manifestos:
* &quot;Manifeste du Comité constitutionnel de la réforme et du progrès&quot;, 1847 ()
* &quot;Manifeste du Club national démocratique&quot;, 1849 ()

<text>Conrad Schlumberger (2 October 1878 in Gebweiler (Alsace-Lorraine) – 9 May 1936 in Stockholm) and Emile Henry Marcel Schlumberger (21 June 1884 in Gebweiler – 9 May 1953 in Val-Richer) were brothers from the region of Alsace-Lorraine, France, then a part of the German Empire. Their inventions in the area of geophysics and well logging were the beginnings of Schlumberger Well Services and the entire well logging industry.

==Life and work==
Conrad and Marcel were two of six children of an affluent Alsatian Protestant family. Their father, Paul, was descended from a wealthy cotton weaving family. Their mother, Marguerite De Witt, was a political activist. When the brothers were born, their native province Alsace was part of Germany. Their parents decided to send the brothers to Paris to be educated. Both Conrad and Marcel were educated at the top engineering schools in France; Conrad graduated from École Polytechnique in 1900, whereas Marcel graduated from École Centrale Paris in 1907.

Conrad initially worked as a mining engineer at Rodez and Toulouse, and Marcel pursued a career as a railway engineer before participating in the construction of the first French tanks during the first World War. In 1912, Conrad, then a professor at the École des Mines de Paris conceived the idea of prospecting for metal ore deposits by using the electrical conductivity of ore rocks to distinguish them from the less conductive surrounding country rocks. One of the first tests was performed in a bathtub which was filled with various rocks for the experiments. In 1919, the brothers signed an agreement with their father in which their father would support their scientific research. These experiments led to an electrical surface-measuring system for mineral exploration known as a &quot;Schlumberger array.&quot;

In 1923, the brothers began conducting geophysical surveys in various countries including Romania, Serbia, Canada, Union of South Africa, Belgian Congo, and the United States. In 1926, Henri George Doll (Conrad&#x27;s son-in-law) joined the group. In 1926, the brothers formed Société de Prospection Electrique to develop the theory that adding resistivity information from deeper formations would increase the effectiveness of the surface prospecting technique. The first office was in Paris on the rue Fabert.

On 5 September 1927, Henri George Doll and several field engineers ran the first wireline electric log. This log was of the Diefenbach #2905 well, Rig 7 of the Pechelbronn Oil Company at Merkwiller-Pechelbronn in the Bas-Rhin. The well was about 500 meters deep but only the interval from 130m to 270m was logged. A measurement was made every meter. The equipment was stopped, and the logging cable was connected to the surface potentiometer and to a battery power supply to make a measurement. The logging rate was about 50 meters per hour. The Schlumberger brothers called this technique an &quot;Electrical Survey&quot;, but the more common name &quot;well log&quot; was coined a few years later in the United States.

At that time, Pechelbronn was the only oil field known in France. On 28 July 1928, the owners of the oil field signed a contract with the Schlumberger company to do oil well logging. The first contract was for 12,000 Francs (about $2600 US dollars) per month. This was the first well logging program.

The Schlumberger company then tried to expand their activities to many other countries, but the attempts were hindered by the worldwide depression. On 15 September 1934, Schlumberger&#x27;s subsidiary in the United States became Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation (SWSC) with offices in Houston, Texas. Conrad was the chairman, and Marcel was the president. In 1936, Conrad died of a heart attack while returning from a business trip to the Soviet Union. During the German occupation of France, the company headquarters was moved from Paris to Houston. Marcel died in 1953. After World War II, Marcel&#x27;s son Pierre Schlumberger took over the American company. Pierre Schlumberger&#x27;s second wife was the eccentric São Schlumberger, who was for some years the biggest individual customer of haute couture clothing.

In 1955, in recognition of Conrad Schlumberger&#x27;s outstanding contribution to exploration geophysics, The European Association of Exploration Geophysicists (now European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers) established a Conrad Schlumberger Award. Each year the Award is presented to a member of the Association who has made an outstanding contribution over a period of time to the scientific and technical advancement of the geosciences, particularly geophysics. Notable recipients of the award include Nigel Anstey, Les Hatton and Michael Schoenberg, among others.

Marcel Schlumberger&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter is actress Léa Seydoux on her father&#x27;s side, and she is a great-granddaughter of Marcel&#x27;s brother Maurice on her mother&#x27;s side.

<text>In Greek mythology, Sinope (; Ancient Greek: Σινώπη) was one of the daughters of Asopus and thought to be an eponym of the city Sinope on the Black Sea.

== Family ==
Sinope&#x27;s mother was Metope, daughter of the river-god Ladon. In one account, she was called the daughter of Ares and Parnassa. In the account of her being the offspring of Ares, Sinope was probably one of the Amazons.

== Mythology ==
According to Corinna and Diodorus Siculus, Sinope was carried away by the god Apollo to the place where later stood the city honouring her name. Diodorus adds that she bore to Apollo a son named Syrus, supposedly afterwards king of the Syrians, who were named after him.

However, the Argonautica and Valerius Flaccus relate that Sinope was abducted to the site by Zeus, who, in his passion, swore to fulfil her dearest wish. Sinope declared she wished to remain a virgin. Sinope later tricked Apollo and the river Halys in the same fashion and remained a virgin all her life.

<text>WesternGeco is a geophysical services company. It is headquartered in Schlumberger House on the property of London Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex.
==Background==
The company provides reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development services. The company, a business segment of Schlumberger, offers 3D and time-lapse seismic surveys, electromagnetic surveys, and multicomponent surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir management. It also provides geophysical, land and transition-zone acquisition, marine acquisition, electromagnetics, and data processing and reservoir seismic services.

The company was formed by the merger in 2000 of two of the world&#x27;s largest seismic contractors, Western Geophysical (founded in 1933) and Geco-Prakla. Schlumberger, owners of Geco-Prakla paid cash to Baker Hughes, which then owned Western, for a 70% stake in a joint venture of the combined companies. In May 2006, Schlumberger bought out Baker Hughes&#x27; 30% stake for a reported $2.4 billion, making WesternGeco one of its subsidiaries.

==Exit seismic data acquisition==
In January 2018, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard announced that Schlumberger would be exiting the seismic data acquisition business, both onshore and offshore, while retaining its multiclient data processing and interpretation segments. This decision followed the bankruptcy filings of several competitors in the seismic services sector.

In August 2018, the seismic data acquisition business was sold to Shearwater GeoServices.

==Head office==
WesternGeco has its head office and its Europe/African offices in the Schlumberger House, a building on the grounds of Gatwick Airport in Crawley, England.

<doc id="635836" wikidata="Q2569017" url="?curid=635836" title="Apennine culture">
<text>The Apennine culture is a technology complex in central and southern Italy from the Italian Middle Bronze Age (15th–14th centuries BC). In the mid-20th century the Apennine was divided into Proto-, Early, Middle and Late , but now archaeologists prefer to consider as &quot;Apennine&quot; only the ornamental pottery style of the later phase of Middle Bronze Age (BM3). This phase is preceded by the Grotta Nuova facies (central Italy) and by the Protoapennine B facies (southern Italy) and succeeded by the Subapennine facies of 13th-century (&quot;Bronzo Recente&quot;). Apennine pottery is a burnished ware incised with spirals, meanders and geometrical zones, filled with dots or transverse dashes. It has been found on Ischia island in association with LHII and LHIII pottery and on Lipari in association with LHIIIA pottery, which associations date it to the Late Bronze Age as it is defined in Greece and the Aegean.

==Society==

The people of the Apennine culture were alpine cattle herdsmen grazing their animals over the meadows and groves of mountainous central Italy. They lived in small hamlets located in defensible places. On the move between summer pastures they built temporary camps or lived in caves and rock shelters. Their range was not necessarily confined to the hills; their pottery has been found on the Capitoline hill at Rome as well as on the islands mentioned above.

The linguistic affiliations of the Apennine culture are unknown, but Massimo Pallottino speculated that the Apennine culture was practiced mainly by speakers of unknown languages in the Italic branch of Indo-European, from which the historical languages descended. However, the Proto-Italic language is more commonly hypothesized to have been introduced to the Italian peninsula by the later Proto-Villanovan culture (1200–900 BC), and perhaps by the contemporary but more northerly Terramare culture (1700–1150 BC).

==Sites==
Some of the major sites of the culture are described below.

===Latium (Lazio)===

====Colle della Capriola (&quot;Capriola hill&quot;)====
Capriola hill is located to the south of Bolsena on the eastern side of Lake Bolsena. In ancient times Bolsena was part of Etruria. In addition to remains of Etruscan structures there is a distinct site representing a hamlet of the Apennine Culture that was occupied continuously from the late Neolithic through the Eneolithic, indicating that the population existed before the Apennine and adopted it by cultural diffusion. Excavated by Bloch in 1958 the site evidences wattle-and-daub huts with thatched roofs supported by internal poles. The huts were about by placed on rock-cut foundations. They were surrounded with stone walls for individual defence.

====Luni sul Mignone====
At approximately 10 km from Blera (northern Lazio) to the west of the frazione of Civitella Cesi, on the left bank of the small Mignone river, next to an abandoned railroad bridge is the acropolis of Luni sul Mignone. The place has been abandoned for centuries (except for archaeologists) and is inaccessible except by foot from Civitella Cesi.

On the acropolis and in a plain to the east, Tre Breci, is a site continuously occupied from the Neolithic to the Iron Age, in addition to the remains of Etruscan Luni (which was then in Etruria) on a higher plateau nearby. The Etruscan citadel is later. Part of the sequence of tre Breci belongs to the Apennine Culture.

This site was excavated 1960–1963 by the Swedish Institute at Rome and numerous C-14 dates and the association of Late Helladic pottery with Apenninic pottery, both found there, were used to date the Apenninic pottery phases. Carl Eric Östenberg summarized them as: I (1350/1300–1250), II (1250–1150), III (1150–1000), IVA (1000–850) and IVB (850–800); that is, the Apenninic there is Late Bronze Age persisting to 800 BC without the Villanovan.

Noteworthy at the site are the foundations of three houses cut into rock as deep as , with rammed earth over limestone chips for floors. The lengths are , and at wide. The walls were stone with possibly thatched roofs. There were multiple entrances. Pottery was chiefly cooking ware. Portable hearths and hand mills were found, along with remains of wheat, barley, beans and peas. The animal bones were chiefly cattle but also pigs, sheep and goats. The population apparently farmed and raised animals. The size of the dwellings and the multiple entrances may indicate multi-family residences.

===Apulia (Puglia)===

====Coppa Nevigata====

Southwest of Manfredonia, on the coast of the Gargano in northern Apulia, are the remains of a site initially occupied during the Neolithic, and reoccupied during the Protoapennine, Apennine, and Subapennine phases of the Bronze Age. The site was fortified and has evidence of early purple dye and olive oil production, as well as contacts with the civilizations of the Aegean.

===Campania===

====La Starza====
Astride Campanian Apennine, near modern Ariano Irpino, was the more ancient populated place in Campania region. It was continuously inhabited since 6th millennium until , so traces of the entire Apennine culture were left there.

====Nola====
The Avellino eruption of Vesuvius in the Bronze Age preserved the pottery and remains of a village of the Apennine Culture in and under sediments from pyroclastic flow. The site is in the comune of Nola, at the locality of Croce del Papa. Unusual about the site is that the forms of perishable objects could be recovered with clarity from the cavities they left in the ash. Remains of goats were found, and also the hoof-prints of goats, sheep, pigs and cattle. Also striking are the thousands of human footprints left in the semi-indurated ash by the population fleeing into the Apennines. The remains suggest that Italics were present in Campania since at least the Middle Bronze Age.

==Genetics==
A 2023 study by Hannah M. Moots et al. analyzed the ancient DNA of 4 individuals of the Apennine culture from the Pian Sultano necropolis, near Cerveteri, in northern Lazio, dating back to the Middle Bronze Age. The most important ancestral component was that of the Early European Farmers, followed by those of the Western Steppe Herders and the Western Hunter-Gatherers.

<text>Burton-in-Kendal is a village and civil parish on the extreme southern edge of Cumbria, England. The parish contains around 660 houses and in the 2001 census had a population of 1,411, increasing at the 2011 census to 1,497. Historically within the county of Westmorland (with parts of the surrounding area within Lancashire), the village straddles the A6070 road between Crooklands and Carnforth, at a point around midway between Lancaster and Kendal, and is in the shadow of the nearby limestone outcrop known as Farleton Knott.

==History==
The ancient village church is dedicated to St James. In the 18th century Burton was home to an important corn market. The composer Felix Borowski was born in the village in March, 1872. The Manor of Burton is held by the Atkinson family and whilst land and property holdings were disposed of, the title of Lord of the Manor was retained. 
Due to its position, the history of Burton in Kendal lies in transport, as travellers used its many inns to eat, drink, and rest their pack horses before entering or leaving the county. There are also a multi-use games area (MUGA), tennis courts and a bowling green which are operated by various sports groups within the village.

The village has a rich local history. Kath Hayhurst has produced a book of photographs and annotations entitled &quot;Burton-in-Kendal, Clawthorpe and Dalton – Photographic Memories&quot;. Copies are available from the village shop or from the Holme and District Local History Society.

==Community==
A group of villagers produce a regular monthly newsletter called the &quot;Burton News&quot; which is distributed free to every household in the parish. Burton News came first in its category of monthly magazine in a contest organised by the Diocese of Carlisle in 2002.

The village is situated ideally for access to the Lake District; the west coast; and to the east, the Yorkshire Dales; and Howgill Fells.

Burton in Kendal&#x27;s local football club, Burton Thistle F.C., currently play in the North Lancashire and District Football League in the nearby hamlet of Clawthorpe.

==Governance==
The parish is in the electoral ward of Burton and Holme. This stretches to both villages and their surrounding areas. The total population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 3,789.

The parish of &quot;Burton-in-Kendal&quot; was formed on 1 April 1986 from the parishes of &quot;Burton&quot; and &quot;Dalton&quot;.

==People==
The novelist and poet Anne Spillard who lives in the village won the Yorkshire Post Book Award for Best First Work for her novel The Cartomancer in 1987.

The writer and poet David Craig lives in Burton. Born in Aberdeen he taught Creative Writing at the University of Lancaster from 1969 to 1992 and remains an emeritus professor. His books include three novels, five travel and oral history, and four collections of poetry.

The novelist Joe Stretch grew up in the village during the 1990s.

Guitarist and musician Mo Witham lives in Burton with his singer wife Kelly. Originally from Southend-on-Sea Mo was a major part of the Southend pub-rock scene and has played guitar in various rock and pop bands since the 1960s, including The Orioles and Legend.

<text>Viscount Howard of Bindon was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1559 for Thomas Howard, second son of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. His two sons, the second and third Viscount, both succeeded him in the title. As neither had any male children, the title became extinct on the death of the third Viscount in 1611. The title referred to Bindon Abbey in Dorset.

The title is in some sources referred to as Viscount Bindon. The Bindon title was revived in 1706 when another member of the Howard family, Henry Howard, Lord Walden, was made Earl of Bindon.

<doc id="635859" wikidata="Q7749627" url="?curid=635859" title="The Maid of the Mountains">
<text>The Maid of the Mountains, called in its original score a musical play, is an operetta or &quot;Edwardian&quot; musical comedy in three acts. The music was by Harold Fraser-Simson, with additional music by James W. Tate, lyrics by Harry Graham and additional lyrics by Frank Clifford Harris and Valentine, and the book was written by Frederick Lonsdale, best known for his later society comedies such as &quot;On Approval&quot;. After an initial try-out at the Prince&#x27;s Theatre in Manchester on 23 December 1916, the show was rewritten and opened at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in London on 10 February 1917.

Produced by Robert Evett (after being turned down by Frank Curzon) and directed by Oscar Asche (who had directed the record-setting hit &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot;), &quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot; ran for 1,352 performances in its initial London run – closing mainly because of the nervous exhaustion of its female lead, José Collins. This highly profitable run saved the George Edwardes estate, then being managed by Evett, from bankruptcy.

The original New York production (1918) did not catch on, only running for 37 performances. However, Asche also directed the first Australian production for J. C. Williamson&#x27;s in Australia in 1917, followed by another production in 1923. This became as successful as the London production, with soprano Gladys Moncrieff becoming famous as Teresa. The show had major London revivals in 1921, 1930, 1942 (starring Sylvia Cecil at the London Coliseum) and 1972 in an Emile Littler production at the Palace Theatre in the West End, and at the Finborough Theatre, London, in December 2006 with a cast including Anita Louise Combe, as well as numerous other professional productions elsewhere.

The musical was popular with amateur theatre groups, particularly in Britain, from the 1930s to about 1970.

==Background==
&quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot; was one of the three most important musical hits of the London stage during World War I (the other two being a revue entitled &quot;The Bing Boys Are Here&quot; and the musical &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot;); music or scenes from all of these have been included as background in many films set in this period, and they remain intensely evocative of the &quot;Great War&quot; years. Other hit shows of the period were &quot;Theodore &amp; Co&quot; (1916), &quot;The Boy&quot; (1917), and &quot;Yes, Uncle!&quot; (1917). Audiences wanted light and uplifting entertainment during the war, and these shows delivered it.

Some of the most popular songs were: &quot;Love Will find a Way&quot;, &quot;A Bachelor Gay&quot;, &quot;A Paradise for Two&quot;, &quot;My life is Love&quot;, and &quot;Live for Today&quot;.

The &quot;romantic&quot; ending, with Teresa finally united to Baldassaré, was personally insisted on by José Collins (in the play as originally written, she ended up with the faithful but less colourful character of Beppo). Beppo and Teresa&#x27;s duets remain, however, and the role of Baldassaré remains a non-singing part.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot; is an escapist story set in a bandit camp, high up in the mountains (presumably in Italy). The bandit maid Teresa loves the bandit chief, Baldassaré, who is feared by the whole country. Baldassaré&#x27;s men are unhappy because of the decision of Baldassaré to disband, and they ask Teresa to dissuade him. Baldassaré gives Teresa and the others their shares of the spoils of many raids. He tells her that she must leave at once, because their hiding place is surrounded. She pleads to be allowed to stay, but goes sadly. The local Governor, General Malona, captures Teresa and brings her to the Palace of Santo. He wishes to capture the rebel band before the impending end of his term of office. He promises Teresa her freedom if Baldassaré is captured. Teresa refuses, as &quot;there is honour among thieves.&quot;

Meanwhile, Baldassaré and some of his band have seized the new Governor, Count Orsino. Donning the uniforms of the captives, the brigands proceed to Santo to rescue Teresa. Baldassaré meets and falls in love with Angela, the daughter of the retiring Governor, and becomes heedless of his danger in remaining in the town. He pretends to be the new governor. Beppo, one of the brigands who has always been in love with Teresa, asks her to persuade Baldassaré to leave the capital lest they all be discovered. Teresa, mad with jealousy because of Baldassaré&#x27;s love for Angela, exposes the new &quot;governor&quot; as Baldassaré, and he and his companions are arrested and sent to Devil&#x27;s Island.

Later, Teresa, who sadly regrets betraying Baldassaré, pleads with the General to release him. In the loneliness of his imprisonment, Baldassaré realises that his regard for Angela was only a passing infatuation, and that he loves Teresa. He forgives her betrayal of him and, with the assistance of Lieutenant Rugini, the Governor of the prison, they escape by boat. All ends happily for Teresa and her bandit chief.

<text>Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241 (2004), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving , which authorizes United States district courts to enforce discovery requests made in connection with litigation being conducted in foreign tribunals. Prior to &quot;Intel&quot;, there had been substantial disagreement as to the availability of Section 1782 discovery.

The &quot;Intel&quot; case originated from Advanced Micro Devices&#x27; antitrust claims against Intel in Europe. AMD filed a complaint against Intel in the European Union&#x27;s antitrust enforcement agency (the Directorate-General for Competition), and then filed a lawsuit in the U.S. for discovery of certain Intel documents in order to further their complaint.

<doc id="635867" wikidata="Q6017526" url="?curid=635867" title="Independent practice association">
<text>In the United States, an independent practice association (IPA) is an association of independent physicians, or other organizations that contracts with independent care delivery organizations, and provides services to managed care organizations on a negotiated per capita rate, flat retainer fee, or negotiated fee-for-service basis.

==Operation==
An HMO or other managed care plan can contract with an IPA, which in turn contracts with independent care providers or physicians to treat members at discounted fees or on a capitation basis. The typical IPA encompasses all specialties, but an IPA can be solely for primary care, could be single specialty, or could be a set of other care providers such as psychologists or even providers of social services such as food pantries, homeless shelters, or substance use disorder treatment facilities.

IPAs are typically formed as an LLC, S Corp, C Corp, or other stock entity. Their purpose is not to generate a profit for the shareholders although this can be done. The IPA assembles care providers in self-directed groups within a geographic region to invent and implement health improvement solutions, form collaborative efforts among care providers to implement these programs, and exert political influence upward within the community to effect positive change.

Despite a perception that IPAs have been formed to negotiate as a group with insurance companies in an attempt to improve rates of compensation, under the Federal Trade Commission Act, they cannot negotiate as a group with insurance companies for the providers&#x27; other insurance reimbursement. The IPA can only negotiate for the IPA members those services which are contracted on capitated members. &quot;Messengers,&quot; specialists who are selected to represent individual practices, can be used by IPA members to review and discuss coding and compensation with health insurance companies. These professionals do not collectively bargain and can only do so if the providers have reorganized under a single tax ID number which is not an IPA model.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==

=== Benefits ===
Joining an IPA allows a care provider to focus on providing care. Many IPAs offer management services organization (MSO) amenities including payroll, bookkeeping, benefits management, group purchasing, compliance, marketing, and online reputation management. IPAs may also offer care providers an information technology platform offering automation and/ or a connection to an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Additionally, IPAs structured as risk-bearing entities can give interested care providers the ability to participate in risk contracts even if they don&#x27;t have the administrative staff to coordinate them. Most importantly, an IPA offers a care provider strength in numbers, having dozens to thousands of providers represented together gives a single care provider the ability to participate in programs that would otherwise not be available.

=== Drawbacks ===
There are significant potential drawbacks that may be associated with IPAs as well. Joining an IPA will not relieve a care provider from all of the administrative duties of running a medical practice or other care delivery organization. Also, some IPAs may not be run effectively; this can be due to rapid growth, lack of a sufficiently experience management team, or rapidly changing technology in the field. It is also possible for IPAs to face antitrust issues because they may represent competing healthcare providers.

<doc id="635876" wikidata="Q609950" url="?curid=635876" title="Herschel Walker">
<text>Herschel Junior Walker (born March 3, 1962) is an American former football running back who won the Heisman Trophy and Maxwell Award in 1982 and later played 15 years of professional football in the United States Football League (USFL) and National Football League (NFL). Off the field, he was the Republican nominee in the 2022 United States Senate election in Georgia, and is the nominee for United States Ambassador to the Bahamas in President Donald Trump&#x27;s second term.

Walker played college football at the University of Georgia, winning the Heisman Trophy and Maxwell Award as a junior. He spent the first three seasons of his professional career with the New Jersey Generals of the USFL and was the league&#x27;s MVP during its final season in 1985. After the USFL folded, Walker joined the NFL with the Dallas Cowboys, earning consecutive Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors from 1987 to 1988. In 1989, Walker was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, which is regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NFL history and credited with establishing the Cowboys&#x27; dynasty of the 1990s. He was later a member of the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants before retiring with the Cowboys. Walker was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999.

Outside of football, Walker was a member of the United States&#x27; bobsleigh team at the 1992 Winter Olympics and pursued business ventures in food processing. From 2019 to 2020, he served as a co-chair on the President&#x27;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition under President Donald Trump. Walker launched his first political campaign in Georgia&#x27;s 2022 Senate election, which he lost to Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock.

On December 18, 2024, President-elect Trump announced that he had selected Walker as his nominee to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas.

==Early life and education==
Walker was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Willis and Christine Walker. He was raised in Wrightsville, Georgia. He was one of seven children. Walker said that as a child, he was overweight and had a stutter.

Walker attended Johnson County High School in Wrightsville, where he played football, basketball, and competed in track. He played for the Johnson County Trojans high school football team from 1976 to 1979. In his senior year, he rushed for 3,167 yards, helping the Trojans win their first state championship. He was awarded the inaugural Dial Award as 1979 national high school scholar-athlete of the year.

Walker also competed on the Trojans track and field team in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to the shot put. He won the shot put, 100-yard dash, and 220-yard dash events at the Georgia High School Association T&amp;F State Championships. He also anchored the 4×400 team to victory. 

In his 2008 autobiography, Walker wrote that he was the Beta Club president and class valedictorian at Johnson County High School. In December 2021, Walker&#x27;s Senate campaign website claimed he graduated as the valedictorian of the entire high school, but CNN found no evidence for this claim. The claim on Walker&#x27;s website was later removed and amended to state that Walker graduated high school &quot;top of his class&quot;.

Starting in 2017, Walker has made the false claim that he had graduated from University of Georgia &quot;in the top 1% of his class&quot;. In fact, he did not graduate, and left college to join the USFL. He had yet to return to complete his degree. In December 2021, Walker&#x27;s Senate campaign website deleted the assertions about his education after &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; inquired about it, with Walker acknowledging in a statement that he left the university prior to graduation to play professional football. Walker later falsely asserted he never said he graduated from the university. 42 years after his initial enrollment, he returned to the institution and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Family and Consumer Sciences degree in Housing Management and Policy on December 16, 2024.

Walker played running back and ran on the track and field team for the University of Georgia, where he was a three-time unanimous All-American (football and track), and winner of the 1982 Heisman Trophy and Maxwell Award. He is the first NCAA player who played only three years to finish in the top 10 in rushing yards, a mark later tied by Jonathan Taylor. During his freshman season in 1980, Walker set the NCAA freshman rushing record which was later broken by Taylor. Walker finished third in Heisman voting. Walker was the first &quot;true freshman&quot; to become a first-team All-American. As a freshman, he played a major role in helping Georgia go undefeated and win the de facto national championship with a victory over Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. In 1999, Walker was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.

Walker signed with the New Jersey Generals in 1983, owned by Oklahoma oil tycoon J. Walter Duncan, who after the 1983 season sold the team to Donald Trump. Walker attracted only one major promotional offer, a joint project of McDonald&#x27;s and Adidas.

===National Football League===

====Dallas Cowboys (first stint)====
The Dallas Cowboys, aware of Walker&#x27;s earlier interest in playing for them, acquired Walker&#x27;s NFL rights by selecting him in the fifth round (114th overall) of the 1985 NFL draft.

In 1986, he was signed by the Cowboys and moved to fullback, so he could share backfield duties with Tony Dorsett, becoming the second Heisman backfield tandem in NFL history, after George Rogers and Earl Campbell teamed with the 1984 New Orleans Saints. This move created tension, as it would limit Dorsett&#x27;s playing time, and because Walker&#x27;s $5 million five-year contract exceeded his $4.5 million five-year contract. Walker rushed for the game-winning touchdown with a minute to play in the 31–28 victory against the New York Giants in the season opener. In the week 15 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had a franchise-record 292 yards of total offense, including the NFL&#x27;s longest run of the year with an 84-yarder for a touchdown and an 84-yard touchdown reception.

In 1987, Walker complained to Cowboys management about being moved around between three different positions (running back, fullback, wide receiver) and that Dorsett had more carries. He would be the team&#x27;s main running back, playing in 12 games (11 starts), while registering 891 rushing yards, 715 receiving yards, and 8 touchdowns. Dorsett played in 12 games (6 starts) and had two healthy DNP (Did Not Play), which would make him demand a trade that would send him to the Denver Broncos.

Walker established himself as an NFL running back in 1988, becoming a one-man offense, reaching his NFL career highs of 1,514 rushing yards and 505 receiving yards, while playing seven positions: halfback, fullback, tight end, H-back, wide receiver, both in the slot and as a flanker. He became the 10th player in NFL history to amass more than 2,000 combined rushing and receiving yards in a season. In the process he achieved two consecutive Pro Bowls (1987 and 1988).

In 1989, the Cowboys traded Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for a total of five players (linebacker Jesse Solomon, defensive back Issiac Holt, running back Darrin Nelson, linebacker David Howard, defensive end Alex Stewart) and six future draft picks. The five players were tied to potential draft picks Minnesota would give Dallas if a player was cut (which led to Emmitt Smith, Russell Maryland, Kevin Smith, and Darren Woodson).

====Minnesota Vikings====

Walker&#x27;s trade to Minnesota was initially considered by many as supplying the Vikings with the &quot;missing piece&quot; for a Super Bowl run; however, over time, as the Cowboys&#x27; fortunes soared and the Vikings&#x27; waned, it became viewed as, perhaps, the most lopsided trade in NFL history. From the moment he arrived in Minneapolis, &quot;Herschel Mania&quot; erupted. After a 2½ hour practice where he studied 12 offensive plays, Walker debuted against the Green Bay Packers.

He received three standing ovations from the record Metrodome crowd of 62,075, producing a Vikings win after four successive losses and 14 of the prior 18 games with the Packers. Scout.com says, &quot;Walker was never used properly by the coaching brain trust.&quot; However, the Vikings would not make the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl, in Walker&#x27;s two full seasons there.

&quot;Herschel the Turkey&quot;, a mock honor given out by the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; newspaper to inept Minnesota sports personalities, is named for him.

====Philadelphia Eagles====
After three seasons in Minnesota, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Walker in 1992 hoping he would help them reach the Super Bowl. That year, he rushed 267 times for 1,070 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns to go along with 38 receptions for 278 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns as the Eagles advanced to the Divisional Round before being eliminated.

In the 1993 season, Walker rushed 174 times for 746 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. He was a significant part of the receiving game for the 8–8 Eagles with 75 receptions for 610 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns.

In 1994 he became the first NFL player to have one-play gains of 90 or more yards rushing, receiving and kick-returning in a single season. He spent three seasons in Philadelphia, leaving after the Eagles signed free agent Ricky Watters.

====New York Giants====
The New York Giants signed Walker in 1995 to a three-year contract worth $4.8 million as a third-down back. Walker led the Giants with 45 kick returns at 21.5 yards per return in 1995, his only season with the team.

====Dallas Cowboys (second stint)====
In 1996, he rejoined the Dallas Cowboys as a kickoff return specialist and third-down back. He also played fullback, but primarily as a ball-handler instead of a blocker out of I-Form and pro-sets. Walker retired at the end of the 1997 season.

==Other athletic and competitive activities==
In 1992, Walker competed in the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France as a member of the United States&#x27; bobsleigh team. Originally selected for the four-man team, he eventually competed as the brakeman (or pusher) in the two-man competition. Walker and his teammate Brian Shimer placed seventh.

In November 2007, Walker appeared on the HDNet show &quot;Inside MMA&quot; as a guest. He indicated he would take part in a mixed martial arts reality show in the near future (along with José Canseco) and that he would have an official MMA fight at the conclusion of the show. In September 2009, it was announced that Walker had been signed by MMA promotion company Strikeforce to compete in their heavyweight division at the age of 47.

He began a 12-week training camp with trainer &quot;Crazy&quot; Bob Cook at the American Kickboxing Academy in October 2009 in San Jose, California. In his MMA debut on January 30, 2010, Walker defeated Greg Nagy via technical knock-out due to strikes at .

In 2009, Walker was a contestant in the second season of the reality television show &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;.

Strikeforce confirmed that Walker would face former WEC fighter Scott Carson when he made his second appearance in the Strikeforce cage. Walker was forced off the Strikeforce card on December 4 due to a cut suffered in training that required seven stitches. They fought instead on January 29, 2011, and Walker defeated Carson via TKO (strikes) at 3:13 of round 1.

In 2014, Walker won season 3 of &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off.&quot;

Walker has a fifth-degree black belt in taekwondo.

== Business activities==
In 1984, Walker franchised a D&#x27;Lites fast food restaurant in Athens, Georgia.

In 2002, Walker created Renaissance Man Food Services, which distributes chicken products. Originally, his producer was Sysco Corp. following a casual conversation with a Sysco vice president who asked him to provide some chicken-breading recipes from his mother. He founded Savannah-based H. Walker Enterprises in 2002 as an umbrella company for most of his other business ventures, the largest of which was Renaissance Man Food Services.

Walker has a history of exaggerating the number of people employed by and the assets of his companies; the failure of several business enterprises led to creditors bringing lawsuits. Walker touted Renaissance Man Food Services as one of the largest minority-owned meat processors in the nation, with $70 million in annual sales. In subsequent deposition testimony in a lawsuit, however, Walker gave far lower figures, saying that his company averaged about $1.5 million in annual profits from 2008 and 2017.

Walker has touted Renaissance Man Food Services as a &quot;mini-Tyson Foods&quot;, and also said that the company controlled multiple chicken processing plants. However, in a 2018 declaration submitted in a legal case against his company, Walker acknowledged that the company did not actually own any chicken processing plants and instead partnered with plant owners to sell branded chicken products. Walker&#x27;s business associates later testified that Walker licensed his name to the chicken-related enterprise.

In 2009, Walker told the media that Renaissance Man Food Services had over 100 employees. In 2018, Walker told the media that Renaissance Man Food Services had &quot;over 600 employees.&quot; In 2020, Renaissance Man Food Services informed the U.S. government that it had eight employees. &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; suggested that Walker&#x27;s overestimate of employees could &quot;refer to chicken processing jobs, which are not actually part of Walker&#x27;s business&quot;.

In April 2020, Renaissance Man Food Services applied for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the company ultimately received two PPP loans totaling $180,000 (of which $111,300 was forgiven). On Twitter in April 2020, Walker mocked &quot;big companies&quot; that received PPP money, suggesting that they were &quot;giving back&quot; the money due to being &quot;ashamed&quot;. This was despite Walker being a board member of the Sotherly Hotel Group, owner of the Georgian Terrace Hotel and other hotels; the group received over $9 million of PPP loans in April 2020 while firing 90% of its hotel staff, according to company documents submitted to the U.S. government. According to government records, Walker was paid $247,227 in total from Sotherly from 2016 to 2021.

Walker said that &quot;part of its corporate charter&quot; was to donate 15% of profits to charities. However, none of the four charities that Walker named as beneficiaries confirmed they actually received any donations.

==Political activities==

In 2014, Walker appeared in a commercial paid for by the United States Chamber of Commerce supporting Jack Kingston&#x27;s bid in the Republican primary election for the 2014 U.S. Senate election in Georgia. In 2018, Walker endorsed Republican Brian Kemp in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election.

Walker supported Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, and spoke on Trump&#x27;s behalf at the 2020 Republican National Convention. In 2018, Trump appointed Walker to the President&#x27;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. Trump reappointed him to another two year-term on December 17, 2020. He was removed from the position in March 2022 by President Biden after he was asked to resign. In 2020, Walker endorsed U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler.

===2022 U.S. Senate election in Georgia===
In 2021, Donald Trump encouraged Walker to run for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Walker, a Texas resident, needed to re-establish residency in Georgia to do so. Walker&#x27;s contemplation of entering the race &quot;froze&quot; the Republican field because other prospective candidates for the nomination waited for his decision. In July 2021, Fox News reported that some Georgia Republicans were not sure how effective a candidate Walker would be, citing the fact that his positions on issues of importance to Republican voters were unknown.

In August 2021, Walker announced his run for the Senate seat held by Democrat Raphael Warnock. Walker began his campaign with high favorability ratings and support from self-identified moderate Republicans, and, in October 2021, was endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a sign that the Republican establishment was lining up behind him.

In June 2022, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; found Walker&#x27;s claims about working in law enforcement were either false or unverifiable. Walker has been named as an honorary deputy sheriff in Cobb County and Johnson County. In 2019, Walker said he &quot;spent time at Quantico at the FBI training school&quot; and was &quot;an agent&quot; when, in reality, Walker lacked the bachelor&#x27;s degree required for FBI training. Previously, in 1989, Walker told the media that he &quot;had fun&quot; while attending an FBI school in Quantico for a week, speaking of an &quot;obstacle course and you shoot at targets&quot;.

Many of Walker&#x27;s statements on the campaign trail have been described as &quot;gaffes&quot; or &quot;head-scratching at best&quot;. In an editorial for CNN, Chris Cillizza described Walker as a &quot;walking gaffe machine&quot;, and disputed several statements Walker had made.

On October 5, 2022, Walker&#x27;s campaign fired Taylor Crowe, his campaign political director, over suspicions that he leaked information to the media.

On October 14, 2022, Walker and his Democratic challenger, Raphael Warnock, faced off in their only debate for the Senate election. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Walker&#x27;s demeanor throughout the debate as &quot;aggressive and persistent,&quot; with his frequent interruptions of Warnock and mocking of him for dodging questions. Walker repeatedly tried to link Warnock with President Joe Biden, who carried a low approval rating. During a portion of the debate focusing on crime, Walker revealed what appeared to be a law enforcement badge to illustrate his closeness to law enforcement; he was admonished by the moderators since props were not allowed during the debate. &quot;The Hill&quot; wrote Walker won a &quot;moral victory by avoiding disaster&quot; and &quot;more than avoided embarrassment.&quot;

In a mid-November 2022 campaign speech, Walker discussed watching a film about a vampire, whom he compared to Warnock with a &quot;black suit&quot;. The film showed a person failing to defeat the vampire, said Walker, because of a lack of &quot;faith&quot;. Walker made a call to &quot;have faith in our fellow brothers ... have faith in the elected officials ... that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m here ... I&#x27;m that warrior that y&#x27;all have been looking for&quot;. Also during that speech, Walker said: &quot;A werewolf can kill a vampire ... So, I don&#x27;t want to be a vampire any more. I want to be a werewolf.&quot;

Since no candidate received a majority of the vote in the general election on November 8, 2022, he faced incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock in a runoff election on December 6, and lost. The final tally of votes was 51.40% for Warnock and 48.60% for Walker. Walker conceded the election that night, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to make any excuses now because we put up one heck of a fight. [...] I want you to continue to believe in this country, believe in our elected officials, and most of all, stay together&quot;.

==Political positions==
=== 2020 presidential election ===

After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Walker tweeted a video supporting Trump&#x27;s efforts to overturn the election results. Walker has spread many conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. Walker claimed that Biden &quot;didn&#x27;t get 50 million&quot; votes; Biden indeed received over 80 million votes. Walker alleged that there was &quot;country-wide election fraud&quot; and urged Trump and &quot;true patriots&quot; to carry out &quot;a total cleansing&quot; to &quot;prosecute all the bad actors&quot;. He urged re-votes in the states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Walker also spread a conspiracy theory about the 2021 United States Capitol attack, suggesting it was a &quot;well-planned&quot; distraction from election fraud.

In July 2022, when asked whether Joe Biden had fairly defeated Donald Trump in Georgia, Walker replied, &quot;I have no clue.&quot; In the October debate with Warnock, when asked if Joe Biden was the winner of the 2020 election, Walker stated, &quot;President Biden won and Raphael Warnock won.&quot;

=== Abortion ===

In May 2022, Walker stated he opposes abortion, and wants no exceptions to abortion bans. He also called for more money to promote adoption and to support single parents. &quot;You never know what a child is going to become. And I&#x27;ve seen some people, they&#x27;ve had some tough times, but I always said, &#x27;No matter what, tough times make tough people. When asked about the impact of the issue on the November 2022 election, Walker described abortion rights as among the &quot;things that people are not concerned about&quot;. In September 2022, Walker endorsed legislation proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy nationwide, except in cases of rape, incest, and threat to the life of the patient. During his October debate with Raphael Warnock, Walker softened his position on abortion, saying he supported the Georgia law allowing exceptions for rape and threats to the mother&#x27;s life and health.

On October 3, 2022, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; published allegations from a woman who said that Walker impregnated her and paid for her abortion in 2009 when they were dating. The woman supported the allegation by producing images of a personal check from Walker, a get-well card with Walker&#x27;s purported signature, and a $575 receipt for an abortion. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; said that it corroborated the story with a friend of the woman, who &quot;took care of her in the days after the procedure&quot;. Walker stated, &quot;I never asked anyone to get an abortion. I never paid for an abortion.&quot; When asked about the check, Walker said, &quot;I give money to people all the time, because I&#x27;m always helping people&quot;. Walker said he would sue &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; for defamation. After Walker said on October 5 that he did not know the identity of the woman accusing him, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that the woman is the mother of one of Walker&#x27;s children; she told &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; that she had another child with Walker years after the abortion, despite Walker stating that it was not a convenient time for him to have a child, a sentiment he also raised prior to the abortion.

Within a week of the original allegations&#x27; publication, &quot;The New York Times&quot; interviewed the same woman, as well as her friend, corroborating the reporting by &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. The woman additionally told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she ended her relationship with Walker when he advised her to have a second abortion in 2011. Family court records in New York confirm that Walker and the woman had a son, who was born in 2012. On October 7, 2022, Walker acknowledged that his accuser was the mother of his son, and as to whether she had an abortion, Walker said: &quot;I&#x27;m not saying she did or didn&#x27;t have one [an abortion]. I&#x27;m saying I don&#x27;t know anything about that.&quot; He acknowledged the possibility of having given his accuser a &#x27;get well&#x27; card and a check for other reasons, but said he could not remember doing so.

In an October 26, 2022, press conference organized by attorney Gloria Allred, a second woman, who has not identified herself, alleged she had been pressured by Walker to get an abortion in 1993 after a years-long extramarital relationship with him. Walker denied the allegation, saying it was a &quot;lie&quot;. On November 22, Allred held another press conference, where the second woman also spoke, and audio recordings of Walker were shared. The woman read out letters that she said Walker wrote, including one to her which stated: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I have put you through all this stuff.&quot; Allred read out a signed declaration of a friend of the second woman, which stated that the second woman originally said that she had a miscarriage, but the friend suspected that it was an abortion because the friend knew that Walker was married at the time and did not want to have a child with the second woman; years later, the second woman told the friend that Walker actually sent her to a clinic for an abortion.

=== Economy ===

Walker favors reducing federal regulations to boost business. He supports widespread tax cuts, building the Keystone Pipeline and increasing production of fossil fuels. He proposes to &quot;lower healthcare costs by increasing competitive market options&quot;. Walker supports putting closed oil fields back into production and rolling back oil-field regulations in order to reduce inflation.

=== Environment and climate change ===
When asked about the Green New Deal environmental program, Walker said that he opposed it because &quot;Since we don&#x27;t control the air our good air decided to float over to China&#x27;s bad air so when China gets our good air, their bad air got to move. So it moves over to our good air space. Then now we got we to clean that back up.&quot; In August 2022, in response to questions about the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes funding to counteract climate change, Walker said, &quot;They continue to try to fool you that they are helping you out. But they&#x27;re not&quot;. Possibly referring to a provision that allocated $1.5 billion to the U.S. Forest Service&#x27;s Urban and Community Forestry Program, Walker added, &quot;Because a lot of money, it&#x27;s going to trees. Don&#x27;t we have enough trees around here?&quot; Walker told supporters at a November 2022 rally that America isn&#x27;t &quot;ready for the green agenda. ... What we need to do is keep having those gas-guzzling cars. We got the good emissions under those cars&quot;.

=== Guns ===

When asked in May 2022 on how to tackle gun violence, Walker said: &quot;Cain killed Abel and that&#x27;s a problem that we have. What we need to do is look into how we can stop those things.&quot; Walker then suggested &quot;getting a department that can look at young men that&#x27;s looking at women, that&#x27;s looking at their social media&quot;, and also by &quot;putting money into the mental health field ... rather than departments that want to take away your rights.&quot; When asked if he supported new gun laws in the wake of the Uvalde school shooting, Walker responded: &quot;What I like to do is see it and everything and stuff.&quot;

=== LGBT rights ===

Walker opposes allowing transgender athletes to compete in women&#x27;s sports events, stating in September 2022: &quot;Let&#x27;s get men out of women&#x27;s sports&quot;. Walker also discussed transgender children in general, stating, &quot;they&#x27;re telling the young kids in school, you can be a boy tomorrow even if you&#x27;re a girl... But I want the young kids to know you go to heaven. Jesus may not recognize you. Because he made you a boy. He made you a girl.&quot;

Asked about same-sex marriage, Walker said states should be free to decide the legality of same-sex marriage.

=== National security ===

Walker supports a wall at the border with Mexico. He wants the United States to &quot;heavily invest&quot; in the military.

==Diplomatic career==
On December 17, 2024, Walker was named by President-elect Donald Trump as his presumptive nominee for the position of U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas.

==Personal life==
Walker has lived in Westlake, Texas, and in the Las Colinas area of Irving, Texas.

In August 2021, as he was preparing to run for U.S. Senate, Walker registered to vote in Georgia and listed his residence as Buckhead, Georgia; the property is owned by his wife Julie Blanchard. However, in a January 2022 political campaign event, Walker said: &quot;I live in Texas … I was sitting in my home in Texas …&quot; Tax records also show that Walker&#x27;s primary residence for 2021 and 2022 is still registered as Tarrant County, Texas, where he continues to receive property tax breaks.

===Relationships and children===
Walker married Cindy DeAngelis Grossman, whom he met in college, in 1983. They have a son, Christian, a social media influencer After 19 years of marriage, Walker and Grossman divorced in 2002. Julie Blanchard in 2012 said that she was Walker&#x27;s fiancée; Walker married Blanchard in 2021.

Walker has two additional sons and a daughter whom he did not publicly acknowledge before his 2022 US Senate campaign; he did so in June 2022, one day after &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported on one of his additional sons. Walker said that month, during a conference, that he &quot;never denied&quot; having four children. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; later reported that Walker had lied to his 2022 Senate campaign about how many children he had, while &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported &quot;allies to Walker&quot; stating that Walker had not been honest about how many children he had. Walker said that he did not publicly acknowledge his children to prevent exposing them to unwanted attention, and criticized the claim that &quot;I hide my children because I don&#x27;t discuss them with reporters to win a campaign&quot;. Earlier during his Senate campaigning, Walker repeatedly discussed his relationship with eldest son Christian.

Prior to publicly acknowledging his other children, in a 2020 interview, Walker said that fatherless households were a &quot;major, major problem&quot; in African-American communities. In October 2022, Walker&#x27;s adult son Christian criticized Walker, stating, &quot;my favorite issue to talk about is father absence. Surprise! Because it affected me. ... He has four kids, four different women. Wasn&#x27;t in the house raising one of them. He was out having sex with other women.&quot; Also in October 2022, the mother of another of Walker&#x27;s sons (born in 2012), said that Walker had seen his son &quot;maybe ... three times&quot;, with Walker&#x27;s parenting contributions mostly being court-ordered child support and sporadic gifts, while suggesting that the gifts were actually from Walker&#x27;s fiancée/wife Julie Blanchard, and not from him.

===Domestic violence allegations===
In September 2001, when Walker and Grossman were estranged, an Irving, Texas, police report stated that police were called to Grossman&#x27;s home by Walker&#x27;s therapist due to Walker&#x27;s visit there; Walker was &quot;volatile&quot;, had a weapon, and was scaring Grossman. The report stated that Walker &quot;talked about having a shoot-out with police&quot;; the therapist, Jerry Mungadze, defused the situation after speaking to Walker for at least half an hour. The report stated that police confiscated a SIG Sauer handgun from Walker&#x27;s car, put his home on a &quot;caution list&quot; due to Walker&#x27;s &quot;violent tendencies&quot;, but did not arrest or charge Walker. In a separate incident, Mungadze told the media that when he conducted a therapy session with Walker and Grossman, he called 911 because Walker &quot;threatened to kill&quot; all three of them, prompting the police to arrive; the result of the incident was Walker hitting a door, breaking his fist.

In filing for divorce in December 2001, Grossman accused him of &quot;physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior.&quot; After the divorce, she told the media that, during their marriage, Walker pointed a pistol at her head and said: &quot;I&#x27;m going to blow your f&#x27;ing brains out.&quot; She also said he had used knives to threaten her. In 2005, a restraining order was imposed on Walker regarding Grossman, after Grossman&#x27;s sister stated in an affidavit that Walker told her &quot;unequivocally that he was going to shoot my sister Cindy and her [new] boyfriend in the head.&quot; As a result, a temporary gun-owning ban was also issued to Walker by a judge. Walker stated that he does not remember the assault or the threats and attributed his aberrant behavior with his wife and others to his dissociative identity disorder for which he was diagnosed in 2001.

In January 2012, a woman, Myka Dean, made a report to Irving, Texas, police that when she attempted to end a 20-year &quot;on-off&quot; relationship with Walker, he &quot;lost it&quot; and threatened to wait at her home to &quot;blow her head off&quot;. The responding police officer described this as &quot;extreme threats&quot;. Federal records show that Dean, as well as her mother and stepfather, were business partners of Walker&#x27;s, for his company Renaissance Man Inc. Dean died in 2019; Walker&#x27;s 2022 political campaign stated that the allegations in the 2012 police report were false, and that Walker still had a good relationship with Dean&#x27;s parents.

In October 2022, Walker&#x27;s adult son Christian publicly accused Walker of having threatened to kill him and his mother. He addressed Walker on Twitter, stating: &quot;You&#x27;re not a &#x27;family man&#x27; when you left us to bang a bunch of women, threatened to kill us, and had us move over 6 times in 6 months running from your violence ... how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you&#x27;re some &#x27;moral, Christian, upright man&#x27; ... You&#x27;ve lived a life of DESTROYING other peoples lives.&quot; Soon after Christian made the allegations, Walker wrote on Twitter that he loved his son &quot;no matter what&quot;.

In December 2022, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that Cheryl Parsa, an ex-girlfriend of Walker who lives in Dallas, had alleged that in 2005, during their relationship, she found Walker with another woman. According to Parsa, Walker got angry, put his hands on Parsa&#x27;s neck and chest, and swung a fist at her.

===Mental health===

Walker has spoken publicly about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and has served as spokesperson for a mental health treatment program for veterans. Walker says he wrote the 2008 book &quot;Breaking Free: My Life with Dissociative Identity Disorder&quot; to help dispel myths about mental illness and to help others. DID is among the most controversial of the dissociative disorders and among the most controversial disorders found in the DSM-5-TR, with many psychiatrists expressing doubts of its validity.

In the book, Walker wrote that he had a dozen distinct identities, or alters. According to Walker, some of his alters did many good things, but other alters exhibited extreme and violent behavior, which Walker said he mostly could not remember. A competitive alter caused him to play Russian roulette in 1991, as he saw &quot;mortality as the ultimate challenge&quot;, he wrote. He was formally diagnosed with the disorder in 2001, after he sought professional help for being tempted to murder a man who was late in delivering a car to him.

Walker attributed his divorce to his behavior caused by the disorder. According to Walker&#x27;s ex-wife, for the first 16 years of their marriage, Walker&#x27;s alters were somehow controlled, and she had no idea that he had any disorder. Grossman said that the situation greatly deteriorated once Walker was diagnosed, after which he began to exhibit either &quot;very sweet&quot; alters or &quot;very violent&quot; alters who looked &quot;evil&quot;. She said that in one situation where Walker exhibited two alters, she was in bed when he held a straight razor to her throat and repeatedly stated that he would kill her. Walker did not deny Grossman&#x27;s account, saying that he did not remember it, because blackouts were a symptom of the disorder.

While receiving treatment for dissociative identity disorder in May 2002, Walker was the subject of an Irving, Texas, police report made by a friend of Grossman, Walker&#x27;s ex-wife. She said that he followed her home and that she was &quot;very frightened&quot; of Walker, but did not want police to make contact with him as it would &quot;only make the problem worse.&quot; She reported previously having a &quot;confrontation&quot; with Walker sometime around 2001, which was followed by Walker calling her to threaten her and &quot;having her house watched&quot;.

<text>The Tank, Cruiser, Mk I (A9) was a British cruiser tank of the interwar period. It was the first cruiser tank: a fast tank designed to bypass the main enemy lines and engage the enemy&#x27;s lines of communication, as well as enemy tanks. The Cruiser Mk II was a more heavily armoured adaptation of the Mark I, developed at much the same time.

==Design and development==

In 1936, the British War Office designated two different kinds of tanks for future development: heavily armoured infantry tanks to be used in close co-operation with infantry during attacks, and fast mobile cruiser tanks designed to make forays deep into enemy territory.

Due to the cost, British replacement designs for Medium Mark II tanks then in service had been cancelled with only three Medium Mark III built. In 1934, Sir John Carden of Vickers-Armstrong was asked to provide a &quot;reasonably cheap tank&quot; as a replacement for some of the medium models then in use. This design was known by General Staff specification A9.

The pilot model of his medium tank design was finished in 1936 and given the designation A9E1. It incorporated the best features of the cancelled Medium Mk III design, but lighter so that it could be powered by a commercial petrol engine. However, this was still in the time of the Great Depression and the tank had a number of cost-cutting measures applied. It was the first British tank to have a centrally located turret and to have powered traverse. The system was by Nash &amp; Thompson and similar to that being introduced on the Vickers Wellington medium bomber aircraft. The armour was light, with a maximum thickness of . Many armour faces were vertical, and there were numerous shot traps, but it could achieve and carried the new high velocity QF 2-pounder (40 mm) gun, which had replaced the QF 3-pounder by the time manufacture started in 1937.

The driver&#x27;s compartment and the fighting compartments were not separated. As well as the turret armament, which consisted of an Ordnance QF 2 pounder gun and a coaxial Vickers machine gun, there were two small turrets either side of the driver&#x27;s compartment, each with a Vickers machine-gun. Both of these smaller turrets were permanently manned, which gave the tank a total crew of six (commander, gunner, loader, driver and two machine-gunners).

The A9E1 was tested against other designs and, although lacking in some areas, it was accepted in 1937 as an interim design until a Christie suspension cruiser tank could be delivered. An order was placed for 125. Seventy-five were built by Harland &amp; Wolff, and the other 50 were built by Vickers. Initially, a Rolls-Royce car engine (the 7.67 litre of the Phantom II) was used for the pilot model, but this proved to be underpowered and was replaced by a 9.64 litre AEC bus engine.

The later Valentine infantry tank essentially used the same lower hull and suspension, though with considerably more armour.

The A9 weighed , was long, high, wide and had a top speed of on road and off. Its maximum road range was . The ammunition load was 100 rounds for the main gun and 3,000 rounds for the three machine guns.

==Service==
The Mark I cruiser began to be delivered in January 1939. 36 tanks were delivered before the start of the war, 40 in September–December 1939 and 49 in 1940.

The Cruiser was an effective tank in the French, Greek and early North African campaigns. The 2-pounder gun was lethal against the early Italian tanks encountered during the North African campaign and could hold its own against Rommel&#x27;s early Panzer IIs and IIIs. It could also breach the of protective steel on later opponents, such as the Panzer III &quot;Ausf&quot; D and the Panzer IV &quot;Ausf&quot; D. It was effective until the Germans introduced the more thickly armoured Panzer IV &quot;Ausf&quot; E to the desert in the spring of 1941. However, its minimal armour made the A9 very vulnerable to most Axis anti-tank weapons. Also problematic was the lack of high explosive shells for the 2-pounder gun, and even worse the lack of armour-piercing shells for the 94 mm gun on the close support version. Another issue was that the areas around the front machine gun turrets created a frontal surface that was more vulnerable to enemy fire than it would have been had it been a simple flat plate.

The mechanical unreliability of the Cruiser was also a disadvantage. In particular, tracks were easily slewed, causing difficulties.

==Variants==
;Mark I (A9)
:Used by the 1st Armoured Division in the Battle of France (1940). Used by the 2nd and 7th Armoured Divisions in North Africa until 1941.

;Mark I CS
:Had a 3.7 inch (94 mm) /L15 breech-loaded howitzer, derived from the World War I QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer, instead of the 2-pounder gun. 40 rounds, mostly smoke, were carried.

<doc id="635885" wikidata="Q422273" url="?curid=635885" title="Clindamycin">
<text>Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic medication used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including osteomyelitis (bone) or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, acute otitis media (middle ear infections), and endocarditis. It can also be used to treat acne, and some cases of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). In combination with quinine, it can be used to treat malaria. It is available by mouth, by injection into a vein, and as a cream or a gel to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.
Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and pain at the site of injection. It increases the risk of hospital-acquired &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis about fourfold and thus is only recommended for use when other antibiotics are not appropriate. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.
Clindamycin was first made in 1966 from lincomycin. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 147th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Clindamycin is used primarily to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin may be used to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.

=== Acne ===
For the treatment of acne, in the long term, the combined use of topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide was similar to salicylic acid plus benzoyl peroxide. Topical clindamycin plus topical benzoyl peroxide is more effective than topical clindamycin alone.

=== Susceptible bacteria ===
It is most effective against infections involving the following types of organisms:

* Aerobic Gram-positive cocci, including some members of the &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot; (&quot;e.g.&quot; pneumococcus) genera, but not enterococci.
* Anaerobic, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, including some &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, and &quot;Prevotella&quot;, although resistance is increasing in &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot;.

Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (such as &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Legionella&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; and &quot;Moraxella&quot;) are resistant to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is &quot;Capnocytophaga canimorsus&quot;, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice.

The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens.

*&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;: 0.016 μg/mL – &gt;256 μg/mL
*&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;: 0.002 μg/mL – &gt;256 μg/mL
*&quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;: &lt;0.015 μg/mL – &gt;64 μg/mL

=== D-test ===
When testing a gram-positive culture for sensitivity to clindamycin, it is common to perform a &quot;D-test&quot; to determine if there is a sub-population of bacteria present with the phenotype known as . This phenotype of bacteria are resistant to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B group of antibiotics, however, the resistance mechanism is only induced by the presence of 14-membered ring macrolides, such as erythromycin. During a D-test, bacteria of the phenotype demonstrate &quot;in vitro&quot; erythromycin-induced &quot;in vitro&quot; resistance to clindamycin. This is because of the activity of the macrolide-inducible plasmid-encoded &quot;erm&quot; gene.

To perform a D-test, an agar plate is inoculated with the bacteria in question and two drug-impregnated disks (one with erythromycin, one with clindamycin) are placed 15–20 mm apart on the plate. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is D-shaped, the test result is positive. Despite the apparent susceptibility to clindamycin in the absence of erythromycin, a positive D-test precludes therapeutic use of clindamycin. This is because the erythromycin-inducible &quot;erm&quot; gene is prone to mutations causing the inducible activity to switch to constitutive (permanently switched on). This in turn, may lead to the therapeutic failure of clindamycin.

If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is circular, the test result is negative and clindamycin can be used.

=== Malaria ===
Given with chloroquine or quinine, clindamycin is effective and well tolerated in treating &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, and is the treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin should not be used as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by &quot;in vitro&quot; drug susceptibility testing.

=== Other ===
Clindamycin may be useful in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). Many strains of MRSA are still susceptible to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA is becoming increasingly resistant.

While it has been used in intraabdominal infections, such use is generally not recommended due to resistance.

Clindamycin is used in cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes the death of the bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).

Clindamycin has been proven to decrease the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to about a third of the risk of untreated women.

The combination of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment for severe babesiosis.

Clindamycin may also be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and, in combination with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; pneumonia.

Clindamycin, either applied to skin or taken by mouth, may also be used in hidradenitis suppurativa.

== Side effects ==
Common adverse drug reactions associated with systemic clindamycin therapyfound in over 1% of peopleinclude: diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps and/or rash. High doses (both intravenous and oral) may cause a metallic taste. Common adverse drug reactions associated with topical formulationsfound in over 10% of peopleinclude: dryness, burning, itching, scaliness, or peeling of skin (lotion, solution); erythema (foam, lotion, solution); oiliness (gel, lotion). Additional side effects include contact dermatitis. Common side effectsfound in over 10% of peoplein vaginal applications include fungal infection.

Rarely in less than 0.1% of people clindamycin therapy has been associated with anaphylaxis, blood dyscrasias, polyarthritis, jaundice, raised liver enzyme levels, renal dysfunction, cardiac arrest, and/or hepatotoxicity.

=== &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; ===

Pseudomembranous colitis is a potentially lethal condition commonly associated with clindamycin, but which also occurs with other antibiotics. Overgrowth of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results in the production of a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.

=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
Use of clindamycin during pregnancy is generally considered safe.

Clindamycin is classified as compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, however, the WHO categorizes it as &quot;avoid if possible&quot;. It is classified as L2 probably compatible with breastfeeding according to &quot;Medications and Mothers&#x27; Milk&quot;. A 2009 review found it was likely safe in breastfeeding mothers, but did find one complication (hematochezia) in a breastfed infant which might be attributable to clindamycin. LactMed lists potentially negative gastrointestinal effects in babies whose mothers take it while breastfeeding but did not see that as justification to stop breastfeeding.

== Interactions ==
Clindamycin may prolong the effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its similarity to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means they should not be given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance.

== Chemistry ==
Clindamycin is a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic produced by the actinobacterium &quot;Streptomyces lincolnensis&quot;. It is obtained by 7(&quot;S&quot;)-chloro-substitution of the 7(&quot;R&quot;)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It has been on the market since 1968.

Clindamycin is white or yellow powder that is very soluble in water. The topically used clindamycin phosphate is a phosphate-ester prodrug of clindamycin.

== Mechanism of action ==
Clindamycin has a primarily bacteriostatic effect. At higher concentrations, it may be bactericidal. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. The binding is reversible. Clindamycin is more effective than lincomycin.

The X-ray crystal structures of clindamycin bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;, and &quot;Haloarcura marismortui&quot; have been determined; the structure of the closely related antibiotic lincomycin bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; has also been reported.

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
Clindamycin is available as a generic medication and is relatively inexpensive.

=== Available forms ===
Clindamycin preparations that are taken by mouth include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, due to its extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.

Several combination acne treatments containing clindamycin are also marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, vaginal suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, vaginal cream containing clindamycin produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis.

Clindamycin is available as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use. (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not available as a generic in the US).

== Veterinary use ==
The veterinary uses of clindamycin are quite similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, for which it is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. They can be used both by mouth and topically. A disadvantage is that bacterial resistance can develop fairly quickly. Gastrointestinal upset may also occur. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.

<text>Sexual differentiation is the process of development of the sex differences between males and females from an undifferentiated zygote. Sex determination is often distinct from sex differentiation; sex determination is the designation for the development stage towards either male or female, while sex differentiation is the pathway towards the development of the phenotype.

In many species, testicular or ovarian differentiation begins with appearance of Sertoli cells in males and granulosa cells in females. 

As male and female individuals develop from embryos into mature adults, sex differences at many levels develop, such as genes, chromosomes, gonads, hormones, anatomy, and psyche. Beginning with determination of sex by genetic and/or environmental factors, humans and other organisms proceed down different pathways of differentiation as they grow and develop.

==Sex determination systems==
Humans, and many mammals, insects and other animals have an XY sex-determination system. Humans have forty-six chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes, XX in females and XY in males. The Y chromosome must carry at least one essential gene which determines testicular formation (originally termed &quot;TDF&quot;). In transgenic XX mice (and some human XX males), &quot;SRY&quot; alone is sufficient to induce male differentiation.

Other chromosomal systems exist in other taxa, such as the ZW sex-determination system in birds and the XO system in insects.

Environmental sex determination refers to the determination (and then differentiation) of sex via non-genetic cues like social factors, temperature, and available nutrients. In some species, such as the hermaphroditic clownfish, sex differentiation can occur more than once as a response to different environmental cues, offering an example of how sex differentiation does not always follow a typical linear path.

There have been multiple transitions between environmental and genetic sex determination systems in reptiles over time, and recent studies have shown that temperature can sometimes override sex determination via chromosomes.

== Humans==
The early stages of human differentiation appear to be quite similar to the same biological processes in other mammals—and the interaction of genes, hormones and body structures is fairly well understood. In the first weeks of gestation, a fetus is anatomically indistinguishable as male or female and lacks production of any particular sex hormones. Only a karyotype distinguishes male from female. Specific genes induce gonadal differences, which produce hormonal differences, which cause anatomic differences, leading to psychological and behavioral differences, some of which are innate and some induced by the social environment.

Various processes are involved in the development of sex differences in humans. Sexual differentiation in humans includes development of different genitalia—and the internal genital tracts, breasts, and body hair—and plays a role in gender identification.

The development of sexual differences begins with the XY sex-determination system that is present in humans, and complex mechanisms are responsible for the development of the phenotypic differences between male and female humans from an undifferentiated zygote. Atypical sexual development, and ambiguous genitalia, can be a result of genetic and hormonal factors.

The differentiation of other parts of the body than the sex organ creates the secondary sex characteristics. Sexual dimorphism of skeletal structure develops during childhood, and becomes more pronounced at adolescence. 

==Other animals==
The first genes involved in the cascade of differentiation can differ between taxa and even between closely related species. For example: in zebrafish the first known gene to induce male differentiation is the &quot;amh&quot; gene, in tilapia it is &quot;tDmrt1&quot;, and in southern catfish it is &quot;foxl2&quot;.

In fish, due to the fact that modes of reproduction range from gonochorism (distinct sexes) to self-fertilizing hermaphroditism (where one organism has functioning gonadal features of multiple sexes), sexual differentiation is complex. Two major pathways in gonochores exist: one with a nonfunctional, undifferentiated phase leading to delayed differentiation (secondary), and one without (primary), where differences between the sexes can be noted prior to hatching. Secondary gonochorists remain in the bipotential phase until a biotic or abiotic cue directs development down one pathway. Primary gonochorism, without an intersex phase, follows classical pathways of genetic sex determination, but can still be later influenced by the environment. Differentiation pathways progress, and secondary sex characteristics such as anal fin bifurcation and ornamentation typically arise at puberty.

In birds, thanks to research on &quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;, it has been shown that determination of sex is likely cell-autonomous, i.e. that sex is determined in each somatic cell independently of, or in conjunction with, the hormone signaling that occurs in other species. Studies on gynandromorph chickens showed that the mosaicism could not be explained by hormones alone, pointing to direct genetic factors, possibly one or a few Z-specific genes such as double-sex or DMRT1.

== Flexibility ==
The most intensively studied species, such as fruit flies, nematodes, and mice, reveal that evolutionarily, sex determination/differentiation systems are not wholly conserved and have evolved over time. Beyond the presence or absence of chromosomes or social/environmental factors, sexual differentiation can be regulated in part by complex systems like the ratio of genes on X chromosomes and autosomes, protein production and transcription, and specific mRNA splicing.

Differentiation pathways can be altered at many stages of the process. Sex reversal, where the development of a sexual phenotype is redirected during embryonic development, happens in the initiation phase of gonadal sex differentiation. Even in species where there is a well-documented master regulator gene, its effects can be overridden by a downstream gene.

Furthermore, hermaphrodites serve as examples of the flexibility of sexual differentiation systems. Sequential hermaphrodites are organisms that possess reproductive capabilities of one sex, and then that sex changes. Differentiated gonadal tissue of the organism&#x27;s former sex degenerates, and new sex gonadal tissue grows and differentiates. Organisms that have the physiological capability to reproduce as a male and as a female at the same time are known as simultaneous hermaphrodites. Some simultaneous hermaphroditic organisms, like certain species of goby, have distinctive male and female phases of reproduction and can flip back and forth, or &quot;sex reverse&quot;, between the two.

=== Socially-determined ===
In some species, such as sequentially hermaphroditic clownfish, changes in social environment can lead to sexual differentiation or sex reversal, i.e. differentiation in the opposite direction. In clownfish, females are larger than males, and in social groups, there is typically one large female, multiple smaller males, and undifferentiated juveniles. If the female is removed from the group, the largest male changes sex, i.e. the former gonad tissue degenerates and new gonad tissue grows. Furthermore, the pathway of differentiation in activated in the largest juvenile, which becomes male.

=== Alternative morphs ===
Sexual differentiation in a species does not have to produce one recognizable female type and one recognizable male type. In some species alternative morphs, or morphotypes, within one sex exist, such as flanged (larger than females, with large flap-like cheek-pads) and unflanged (about the same size as females, no cheek-pads) male orangutans, and sometimes differences between male morphs can be more noticeable than differences between a male and a female within such species. Furthermore, sexual selection can be involved in the development of different types of males with alternative reproductive strategies, such as sneaker and territorial males in dung beetles or haremic males and pair-bonding males in the Nigerian cichlid fish &quot;P. pulcher.&quot; Sometimes alternative morphs are produced by genetic differences, and in other cases, the environment can be involved, demonstrating some degree of phenotypic plasticity.

==Brain differentiation==
In many animals, differences in the exposure of a fetal brain to sex hormones are correlated with significant differences of brain structure and function, which correlate with adult reproductive behavior. The causes of differences between the sexes are only understood in some species. Fetal sex differences in human brains coupled with early differences in experience may be responsible for sex differences observed in children between 4 years old and adolescence.

Many individual studies in humans and other primates have found statistically significant sex differences in specific brain structures; however, some studies have found no sex differences, and some meta-analyses have called into question the over-generalization that women and men&#x27;s brains function differently. Males and females statistically differ in some aspects of their brains, but there are areas of the brain which appear not to be sexually differentiated at all. Some scholars describe human brain variation not as two distinct categories, and not even a maleness-femaleness continuum, but as mosaics.

In birds, hypotheses of male-female brain sex differences have been challenged by recent findings that differences between groups can be at least partially explained by the individual&#x27;s dominance rank. Furthermore, the behavioral causes of brain sex differences have been enumerated in studies of sex differences between different mating systems. For example, males of a polygynous vole species with intrasexual male competition have better spatial learning and memory than the females of their own species, but also better spatial learning and memory than all sexes of other closely related species that are monogamous; thus the brain differences commonly seen as &quot;sex differences&quot; have been instead linked to competition. Sexual selection does play a role in some species, though, as males who display more song behaviors are selected for by females⁠—so some sex differences in bird song brain regions seem to have been evolutionarily selected for over time.

<text>William Nathaniel &quot;Buck&quot; Showalter III (born May 23, 1956) is an American professional baseball manager. He served as manager of the New York Yankees (1992–1995), Arizona Diamondbacks (1998–2000), Texas Rangers (2003–2006), Baltimore Orioles (2010–2018) and New York Mets (2022–2023). He also is a former professional Minor League Baseball player and television analyst for ESPN and the YES Network.

Showalter has earned a reputation for building baseball teams into postseason contenders in short periods of time. He helped the Yankees rise from the bottom half of the AL East to first place before a players&#x27; strike prematurely ended the 1994 campaign. Under his watch, the Diamondbacks made their first-ever playoff appearance in only the second year of the team&#x27;s existence. Despite this reputation, Showalter has never appeared in a World Series; coincidentally, he left both the Yankees and Diamondbacks just prior to seasons when they won the World Series. Since Dusty Baker&#x27;s win in the 2022 World Series, Showalter has become the winningest active manager in MLB never to win a World Series. In 22 seasons, he has reached the postseason six times, reaching the League Championship Series once.

A three-time American League (AL) and one-time National League (NL) Manager of the Year, he is the third manager to win four Manager of the Year awards, the seventh to win the award in both the American and National Leagues, and the only one to win the award with four different teams and in four different decades.

==Early life==
Showalter was born in DeFuniak Springs, Florida, on May 23, 1956, and grew up in nearby Century. His father, William Nathaniel Showalter II, served 23 years as a teacher and principal at Century High School, from which the younger Showalter graduated. Before becoming a teacher, his father had been a Little All-American fullback in 1940 at Milligan College, and had considered a career in the National Football League with the Pittsburgh Steelers, but chose to become a high school coach instead.

==College career==
Showalter was known as &quot;Nat&quot;, and had not acquired the nickname &quot;Buck&quot; prior to turning professional. Showalter played college baseball at Chipola Junior College (now Chipola College) in Marianna, Florida, in 1976. From there he transferred to Mississippi State University to play for the Mississippi State Bulldogs.
In 1976, Showalter played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Hyannis Mets, where he won the league batting title with a .434 batting average, and was named league MVP. In 2002, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.

Showalter was an All-American and set the Mississippi State record for batting average in a season by hitting .459 during the 1977 season.

==Professional career==
He was selected by the New York Yankees in the fifth round of the 1977 MLB draft, and spent seven seasons in the Yankees&#x27; minor league system where he had a career average of .294 with 17 home runs and 336 runs batted in. He never played in the major leagues, rising no higher than Triple-A Columbus (one rung below the majors).

==Coaching and managerial career==
===Minor leagues===
Showalter was hired as manager of the Single-A minor-league Oneonta Yankees of the New York–Penn League in 1985, leading them to 114 victories in two seasons. In August 2017, he was named as an inductee in the New York–Penn League Hall of Fame.

In 1987, Showalter became manager of the minor league Fort Lauderdale Yankees, leading the league with an 85–53 record in his first season. In 1989, Showalter managed the Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Eastern League, where he was named Minor League Manager of the Year by &quot;Baseball America&quot;.

===New York Yankees (1990–1995)===
In 1990, Showalter was promoted to the coaching staff of the New York Yankees, and eventually succeeded Stump Merrill as the team&#x27;s manager for the 1992 season. During his four years as the Yankees&#x27; manager, the team posted a record of 313–268, finishing first during the strike-shortened 1994 season, thereby being named by the Associated Press as the American League Manager of the Year and became the 1995 American League manager for the All-Star Game. The Yankees won the AL wild card in 1995, participating in the playoffs for the first time since 1981. However, they lost to the Seattle Mariners in the Division Series. Following the season, owner George Steinbrenner offered Showalter a new, two-year contract, but demanded that Showalter fire his hitting coach, Rick Down. Showalter was unwilling to do this. On October 26, 1995, the Yankees announced that Showalter and the team had parted ways &quot;&#x27;under amicable terms&#x27;&quot;; Showalter expressed surprise at the announcement. While some sources say that Showalter was fired from the Yankees, others indicate that he resigned his position. Showalter finished his Yankees tenure with a regular-season record of 313 wins and 268 losses and a playoff record of two wins and three losses.

Showalter was not re-hired after that season in part because of the playoff loss, but mostly because he stood up for his players during the strike. The Yankees won the World Series the following year and they would win the World Series in four of the next five years. However, Showalter could not watch the Yankees win the World Series, saying, &quot;I feel badly for the fans&quot; in New York for what they lost during the 1994 strike.

Showalter appeared as himself along with Danny Tartabull in the September 1994 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; television episode &quot;The Chaperone&quot;.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (1998–2000)===
In November 1995, Showalter was approached to manage an expansion team that would begin play in 1998. Named the Arizona Diamondbacks, Showalter was interested in taking a more active role in developing the eventual roster, complete with a $7 million contract for seven years. He had a handshake deal with the team, but Yankees owner George Steinbrenner made one last ditch effort to his home in Florida about wanting him back (Joe Torre had been tapped to manage for the moment). Showalter elected to honor his agreement with Arizona. In the Diamondbacks&#x27; first season (1998), Showalter managed the team to a 65–97 record, but following numerous off-season player acquisitions, which included Randy Johnson, Armando Reynoso, Todd Stottlemyre, Luis Gonzalez, Tony Womack, and Steve Finley, Showalter managed the 1999 team to a 100–62 record and the National League West title, making them the fastest expansion team in MLB history to win a division title. They lost in the NLDS to the New York Mets. After the team regressed to an 85–77 record in 2000, the Diamondbacks fired Showalter on October 1, 2000, with the team citing a need for a &quot;lighter touch&quot; as compared to the disciplinarian approach by Showalter. He had a three-year record of 250–236. Just as the Yankees did after replacing him, the Diamondbacks, managed by Bob Brenly, won the World Series the following year.

===Texas Rangers (2003–2006)===
After a few years as an analyst on ESPN, Showalter was hired as manager of the Texas Rangers on October 11, 2002, following a last-place season under manager Jerry Narron. In his first season with the Rangers, Showalter managed the team to a 71–91 record—again in last place; but following the high-profile, off-season trade which sent Alex Rodriguez to the Yankees, Showalter&#x27;s Rangers jumped out to an early-season record of 17–9 by early May of the 2004 season. The Rangers stayed in playoff contention for most of the season, performing far better than most had predicted. The Rangers failed to make the playoffs, finishing third in the AL West, though Showalter was again named Manager of the Year. In Showalter&#x27;s four years with the Rangers the team failed to finish better than third (of four teams) in the AL West. He was fired as manager on October 4, 2006. He finished his Rangers career with a 319–329 record.

===Baltimore Orioles (2010–2018)===

Showalter was hired as a senior advisor to baseball operations for the Cleveland Indians on December 1, 2006, and then returned to ESPN as an analyst, before being appointed to succeed Juan Samuel as manager of the Baltimore Orioles on July 29, 2010. He chose to wear uniform number 26 as a tribute to Johnny Oates. Signed to a contract through the 2013 campaign, he inherited a ballclub with the worst record in the majors at 32–73. In his debut as manager on August 3, the Orioles recorded a 6–3 win over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim at Oriole Park, leading to a three-game sweep. The team&#x27;s first-ever season series sweep of the Angels was completed by the end of the month. The 2010 Orioles won 34 of 57 games played under Showalter, second only to the Phillies during the same stretch.

Showalter managed the 1,000th victory of his major-league career in a 7–1 triumph at Yankee Stadium on May 1, 2012. Showalter finished the 2012 season with a .574 winning percentage, winning 93 games, and ending a streak of losing seasons for the Orioles at 14.

Under Showalter, the Orioles reached the postseason for the first time since 1997, defeating the Texas Rangers in the Wild Card game on October 5, 2012. The Orioles were later defeated by the New York Yankees in the 2012 American League Division Series, 3 games to 2. Showalter was named the AL Manager of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He was re-signed through 2018 with the Orioles.

After finishing out of playoff contention in the 2013 season, Showalter led the 2014 Orioles to the AL East title—the franchise&#x27;s first in 17 years. The Orioles subsequently swept the Detroit Tigers (3–0) in the ALDS for Showalter&#x27;s first major league ALDS title, before being swept themselves (4–0) by the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS.

On November 11, 2014, Showalter won his third AL Manager of the Year award, his first since 2004.

The Orioles finished the 2015 season with an 81–81 record, giving them their fourth consecutive non-losing season. And in 2016, the Orioles finished tied for second in the American League East with an 89–73 record. They made the postseason for the third time in five years, but lost 5–2 in 11 innings to the Toronto Blue Jays during the AL Wild Card game.

On October 3, 2018, days after the Orioles finished with a franchise-worst 115 losses, Showalter&#x27;s and General Manager Dan Duquette&#x27;s contracts ran out and the team announced that they would not be brought back.

===New York Mets (2022–2023)===
On December 18, 2021, the New York Mets hired Showalter as their manager, signing him to a three-year contract. Showalter wore number 11—the number he wore every other place he managed except Baltimore, where he wore number 26 as a tribute to Johnny Oates.

In 2022, he tied for the lead among all major league managers in overturns (26), and had the highest overturn percentage (78.6%), while he was the only full-season manager not to be ejected from any games. Under Showalter, the Mets had their first 100-win season since 1988, but their division lead (one that reached 10 games at one point) was gradually whittled away by September, with a three-game-sweep by the Atlanta Braves proving key to the finish as the Mets lost the division title to the Braves in an automatic tiebreaker. The Mets would go on to lose the NLWCS in Game 3 to the San Diego Padres. He was named NL Manager of the Year.

Amid a disappointing start to the 2023 season, in the words of &quot;The Athletic&quot;&#x27;s Tim Britton, Showalter&#x27;s performance came &quot;under justified fire&quot; from fans. In spite of that, on June 28, 2023, Mets majority owner Steve Cohen held a press conference in which he affirmed that Showalter&#x27;s job would be guaranteed at least until the end of what Cohen conceded was an &quot;incredibly frustrating&quot; season. Showalter then announced on the final day of the season that he was fired as Mets manager by newly appointed President of Baseball Operations David Stearns.

==Managerial record==


==Personal life==
Showalter has been married to his wife, Angela, since 1983. They have two children, Allie, born in 1987, and William, born in 1991. The couple met in Nashville when he was playing for the Nashville Sounds. When Showalter was manager of the Orioles, his wife was active in the KidsPeace charity for foster children.

<text>The Carlsbad Decrees () were a set of reactionary restrictions introduced in the states of the German Confederation by resolution of the Bundesversammlung on 20 September 1819 after a conference held in the spa town of Carlsbad, Austrian Empire. They banned nationalist fraternities (&quot;Burschenschaften&quot;), removed liberal university professors, and expanded the censorship of the press. They were aimed at quelling a growing sentiment for German unification and were passed during ongoing Hep-Hep riots which ended within a month after the resolution was passed.

==Background==
The meeting of the state&#x27;s representatives was called by the Austrian Minister of State Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich after the liberal Burschenschaft student Karl Ludwig Sand had murdered the conservative writer August von Kotzebue on 23 March 1819, and an attempt had been made by apothecary Karl Löning on the life of Nassau president Karl von Ibell on 1 July 1819. In the course of the European Restoration Metternich feared liberal and national tendencies at German universities which might conduct revolutionary activities threatening the monarchistic order. At this time, the two outrages cited were a welcome pretext to take action.

The Carlsbad Decrees had consequences not only for the rights of the member states but also for the independent academic jurisdiction that had partially been in existence for centuries. An important instrument for the application of the decrees for these and other purposes was the Mainzer Zentraluntersuchungskommission.

An essential attribute of the decrees was that the reactionary German Confederation understood liberal and nationalistic ideas as sedition and persecuted those spreading these ideas as demagogues. This persecution of demagogues, &quot;Demagogenverfolgung&quot;, was especially vigorous in Prussia.

After the Hambach Festival in 1832 the persecution was renewed for the last time. Only after the March Revolution of 1848 were the Carlsbad Decrees abrogated by the German Bundestag, on 2 April 1848.

==Text of the decrees==

The decrees effectively dissolved the Burschenschaften Studentenverbindungen as well as the Turnerschaften and also provided for university inspectors and press censors. Reformers in many local governments were forced out and by 1820 all significant liberal and nationalistic German reform movements had come to an end. The decrees were organized into three sections.

===Student organizations===

1. A special representative of the ruler of each state shall be appointed for each university, with appropriate instructions and extended powers, and shall reside in the place where the university is situated. This office may devolve upon the existing curator or upon any other individual whom the government may deem qualified. The function of this agent shall be to see to the strictest enforcement of existing laws and disciplinary regulations; to observe carefully the spirit which is shown by the instructors in the university in their public lectures and regular courses, and, without directly interfering in scientific matters or in the methods of teaching, to give a salutary direction to the instruction, having in view the future attitude of the students. Lastly, he shall devote unceasing attention to everything that may promote morality, good order, and outward propriety among the students.

2. The confederated governments mutually pledge themselves to remove from the universities or other public educational institutions all teachers who, by obvious deviation from their duty, or by exceeding the limits of their functions, or by the abuse of their legitimate influence over the youthful minds, or by propagating harmful doctrines hostile to public order or subversive of existing governmental institutions, shall have unmistakably proved their unfitness for the important office entrusted to them.

No teacher who shall have been removed in this manner shall be again appointed to a position in any public institution of learning in another state of the union.

3. Those laws which have for a long period been directed against secret and unauthorized societies in the universities shall be strictly enforced. These laws apply especially to that association established some years since under the name Universal Students&#x27; Union (Allgemeine Burschenschaft), since the very conception of the society implies the utterly unallowable plan of permanent fellowship and constant communication between the various universities. The duty of especial watchfulness in this matter should be impressed upon the special agents of the government.

The governments mutually agree that such persons as shall hereafter be shown to have remained in secret or unauthorized associations, or shall have entered such associations, shall not be admitted to any public office.

4. No student who shall be expelled from a university by a decision of the university senate which was ratified or prompted by the agent of the government, or who shall have left the institution in order to escape expulsion shall be received in any other university.

===Press law===

1. So long as this decree shall remain in force no publication which appears in the form of daily issues, or as a serial not exceeding twenty sheets of printed matter, shall go to press in any state of the union without the previous knowledge and approval of the state officials.

Writings which do not belong to one of the above-mentioned classes shall be treated according to the laws now in force, or which may be enacted, in the individual states of the union.

2. Each state of the union is responsible, not only to the state against which the offense is directly committed, but to the whole Confederation, for every publication appearing under its supervision in which the honor or security of other states is infringed or their constitution or administration attacked.

3. The Diet shall have the right, moreover, to suppress on its own authority, without being petitioned, such writings included in Article I, in whatever German state they may appear, as, in the opinion of a commission appointed by it, are inimical to the honor of the union, the safety of individual states, or the maintenance of peace and quiet in Germany. There shall be no appeal from such decisions, and the governments involved are bound to see that they are put into execution.

4. When a newspaper or periodical is suppressed by a decision of the Diet, the editor thereof may not within a period of five years edit a similar publication in any state of the union.

===Investigating committee===

1. Within a fortnight, reckoned from the passage of this decree, there shall convene, under the auspices of the Confederation, in the city and federal fortress of Mainz, an extraordinary commission of investigation to consist of seven members, including the chairman.

2. The object of the commission shall be a joint investigation, as thorough and extensive as possible, of the facts relating to the origin and manifold ramifications of the revolutionary plots and demagogical associations directed against the existing constitution and the internal peace both of the union and of the individual states; of the existence of which plots more or less clear evidence is to be had already, or may be produced in the course of the investigation.

10. The central investigating commission is to furnish the Diet from time to time with a report of the results of the investigation, which is to be carried out as speedily as possible.

<text>Sacking out is a method used by horse trainers to desensitize a horse to potentially frightening situations or objects. It is a process that, done properly, teaches a horse to not fear certain objects or situations, and, over time can be used to teach a horse to stop and listen to its handler in any potentially frightening situation, thus, in effect, to assess the situation instead of immediately acting upon its fight or flight instinct.

An example of the need for desensitizing training is when an object, such as a plastic bag, suddenly blows across the path of horse and rider, which, if the horse has not been properly desensitized, could result in spooking. Spooking is potentially dangerous, as it can result in fallen riders or horses bolting into danger. Another example would be the need to desensitize a horse to the sound of traffic, music, loudspeakers and other stimuli seen at public events. In some cases, a previous bad experience may have given a horse reason to fear a specific situation, requiring a form of systematic desensitization to gradually overcome its fear.

A typical method to desensitize the horse to things like plastic bags is to begin in a step-by-step process with a mildly worrisome object, such as a towel or blanket. A handler reduces the animal&#x27;s wariness of a strange object by showing it to the horse in increasingly vigorous ways, first by simply allowing the animal to sniff it, then to touch or rub it gently over the animal until it shows no sign of fear, then, ultimately to flap it and wave it about. Through multiple sessions, the horse will first become accustomed to a specific object, then, as the horse is introduced to additional stimuli, including large blankets, plastic bags and other potentially frightening but harmless objects, the animal learns to not fear items that a human handler presents to it.

There is controversy over various techniques. Some training methods advocate putting only slight pressure on the horse, allowing it to gradually become accustomed to a frightening object, while other methods sometimes advocate techniques that are based on the operant conditioning principle of flooding, for example, waving a large blanket on and over a horse tied to a sturdy post so that it cannot escape -- the latter methods often being quicker at first, but also far more dangerous because rapid exposure to frightening stimuli can cause a horse to panic, and, if tied or confined, to risk injury to the animal or handler in an attempt to free itself.

<text>A titular see in various churches is an episcopal see of a former diocese that no longer functions, sometimes called a &quot;dead diocese&quot;. The ordinary or hierarch of such a see may be styled a &quot;titular metropolitan&quot; (highest rank), &quot;titular archbishop&quot; (intermediary rank) or &quot;titular bishop&quot; (lowest rank), which normally goes by the status conferred on the titular see.

Titular sees are dioceses that no longer functionally exist, often because the territory was conquered by Muslims or because it is schismatic. The Greek–Turkish population exchange of 1923 also contributed to titular sees. The see of Maximianoupolis along with the town that shared its name was destroyed by the Bulgarians under Emperor Kaloyan in 1207; the town and the see were under the control of the Latin Empire, which took Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Parthenia, in north Africa, was abandoned and swallowed by desert sand.

== Catholic Church ==

During the Muslim conquests of the Middle East and North Africa, some bishops fled to Christian-ruled areas. Even if they did not return and the Christian population of their dioceses dispersed, were killed or abandoned the Catholic faith, they continued to be seen as the bishops of those dioceses, who could give rise, even after long interruption (exile and/or vacancy), to a &#x27;restored&#x27; line of apostolic succession on each see.

The Ordinary or hierarch of a Catholic titular see may be styled a &quot;Titular Metropolitan&quot; (highest rank), &quot;Titular Archbishop&quot; (intermediary rank) or &quot;titular bishop&quot; (lowest rank), which normally goes by the status conferred on the titular see (mostly corresponding to its historical rank), but exceptions &quot;ad hoc&quot; are currently made on a regular basis, either above or below the titular see&#x27;s rank, while titular sees have repeatedly been promoted or demoted.

There are practical advantages in certain circumstances in not establishing a permanent diocese in a given territory, for reasons of the limited size of the Catholic population, its lack of permanence, the likelihood of having to divide the jurisdiction in the near future, and so on. In these circumstances the Catholic Church establishes sometimes not a diocese but a canonical jurisdiction of another kind. This may be, for example, a Mission &quot;sui iuris&quot;, an Apostolic Administration (permanently constituted), an Ordinariate, a Prefecture Apostolic, a territorial Abbey, a Vicariate Apostolic, or a Prelature. The ecclesiastic placed in charge of one of these jurisdictions has a corresponding title, such as Superior of a Mission &quot;sui iuris&quot;, Apostolic Administrator, Ordinary, Prefect Apostolic, territorial Abbot, Vicar Apostolic, or Prelate. The ecclesiastic may be in priestly or episcopal orders. In recent practice an Apostolic Administrator, Vicar Apostolic, or Prelate (in this precise sense) is often appointed (and consecrated) a bishop. If that happens he is assigned a titular see, in addition to his status as head of the territorial jurisdiction. the appointment as bishop is less likely in the case of a Superior of a Mission &quot;sui iuris&quot;, or a Prefect Apostolic, but may happen, especially when a man who is already a bishop governing a particular jurisdiction is appointed cumulatively to govern one of these others. 
A particular territory may have its canonical status changed more than once, or may be united to a neighbouring territory or subdivided, according to developing circumstances. An example might be the uniting on November 30, 1987, of two Egyptian vicariates apostolic, Heliopolis of Egypt and Port Said, to become the single Vicariate Apostolic of Alexandria of Egypt–Heliopolis of Egypt–Port Said, governed by Egypt&#x27;s only Latin Ordinary at present. A different example would be the division, on 6 July 6, 1992, of the Ghanaian diocese of Accra, to separate from its territory the new diocese of Koforidua. At the same date, the diocese of Accra became a Metropolitan Archdiocese. 

After a name change, an abandoned name may be &#x27;restored&#x27; as a titular see, even though a residential successor see exist(ed). Furthermore, the Catholic Church may create more than one titular see named after a single city, by creating one or more lines of apostolic succession assigned to the Latin and/or one or more Eastern Catholic rites, which are not necessarily of the same rank.

It was formerly the practice to add the term &#x27;, often shortened to &#x27; or &quot;i.p.i.&quot;, meaning &quot;in the lands of the unbelievers&quot;, to the name of the see conferred on titular (non-diocesan) Latin Church bishops. Formerly, when bishops fled from invading Muslims, they were welcomed by other churches, while preserving their titles and their rights to their own dioceses. They were entrusted with the administration of vacant sees of other dioceses, or with assisting in such government of a see which already had a residential bishop. In later days it was deemed fitting to preserve the memory of ancient Christian churches which no longer existed; this was done by giving their names to auxiliary bishops or bishops in missionary countries. These bishops did not reside in the sees whose titles they bore, nor could they exercise any power over them, and are not entrusted with their care. They are therefore called &quot;titular&quot; bishops, as opposed to &quot;diocesan&quot; bishops, and the sees themselves are called titular sees, as opposed to &quot;residential&quot; sees.

The regular appointment of titular bishops is said to date back to the time of the Fifth Lateran Council, in 1514; cardinals alone were authorized to ask for titular bishops to be appointed to assist them in their dioceses. Pope Pius V extended the privilege to all sees in which it had become customary to have auxiliary bishops. Since then the practice has become more widespread.

Although the normal constitution of the hierarchy has always been built on the idea of local jurisdiction of the bishops, there are indications, in the early history of the Church, of many who did not enjoy what is usually called ordinary jurisdiction. Besides those who were endowed with the episcopal character, in order to assist the local bishops there were those who had been driven from their dioceses by infidels or by heretics, or who for other reasons could not reside in the places to which they had been appointed. The spread of Islam through Muslim conquests in Asia and Africa was responsible for hundreds of abandoned sees. During the Crusades, the Latins, who established new Christian communities, composed of Europeans and belonging to the Latin Church, procured the erection of new dioceses for their benefit, and these in turn, during the growth of the Ottoman Empire, increased the number of abandoned sees. The final development of the list of sees, called &quot;&quot;, took shape, at first, from the attempt of the Holy See to keep up the succession of bishops in these dioceses, in the hope of reconquering their territory from the infidel. When all hope of such redemption was given up, these titles were still conferred on those who were chosen to assist the diocesan bishops in their labors. After the 14th century the large increase of population in the great centers rendered such assistance particularly necessary. In the 16th century the Holy See inaugurated the policy of consecrating nuncios and other prelates, delegated to represent the Pope in his relations with the different nations, so that they would be equals with the diocesan bishops of the countries in which they were ambassadors.

The foundation of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, in 1622, gave a great impetus to the missionary work of the Church in China and Japan, and elsewhere a great increase in the number of bishops became necessary and those received their titles from the ancient abandoned sees.

Only about 1850, was any attempt made to compile a list of such sees. Gaetano Moroni had already, in 1840, began publication of his 103 volume &quot;Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica&quot; with a separate six volume index. Moroni acknowledged the great difficulties in compiling this work, even after he thoroughly examined all the sources available to him.

In 1851, the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; began to have such a list, but it did not purport to be complete. On the contrary, it contained only those that were in general use. Names of dioceses disappeared and were listed again when the titles were actually assigned.

Until 1882, these titles were given as &#x27;. According to Corrigan, the story goes that King George I of Greece (a Lutheran) complained to Pope Leo XIII that he and his (mostly Eastern Orthodox) people were injured by this appellation, saying to Leo XIII, &quot;we are not infidels, we are Christians; we are Catholics.&quot; Leo XIII, through a Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith decree, in 1882, abolished the phrase &#x27; and ordered that future appointments should be made as &quot;titular bishops&quot;. The custom, when Boudinhon wrote his article, was to join to the name of the see that of the district to which it formerly belonged, or else merely to say &quot;titular bishop&quot;.

The &quot;Annuaire Pontifical Catholique&quot; published a very complete list of the titular sees and titular bishops. Although it did not claim to be perfect, it contained the names of the sees and the bishops who had held the titles as far back, in some cases, as the 14th century.

Titular sees, according to Corrigan in 1920, were conferred on
* Cardinals, who, being only priests, were promoted in Curia to be bishops.
* Nuncios, apostolic delegates and other dignitaries of the Curia, unless they were already diocesan bishops, and under the 1920 custom they were, in that case, translated to titular archbishoprics.
* Coadjutors and Auxiliary bishops.
* Apostolic vicars and, sometimes, on Apostolic prefects in missionary countries.
* Bishops who resign their dioceses, although this was not always done. Sometimes the Holy See refused to do so, and sometimes the bishops did not want it.

In the context of improved relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy after the Second Vatican Council, the Holy See, while continuing to appoint bishops to titular sees in North Africa, ceased to make such appointments to sees that were historically part of the Eastern patriarchates of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. It began instead to treat as titular sees also those Catholic dioceses in any country no longer used as titles of diocesan bishops because of having been absorbed into other dioceses or having been renamed due to a change of the bishop&#x27;s place of residence. For example, several of the sees added by this change of policy are in the western and central United States, such as Grass Valley, California, whose diocese was dissolved upon the erection of the Diocese of Sacramento. The change of practice is reflected in the inclusion from then on of such sees in the official lists of titular sees in editions of the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;.

Previously, titular sees were routinely (yet not always) assigned not only to auxiliary bishops, similar pseudo-diocesan offices and pre-diocesan apostolic vicars or (Eastern Catholic) apostolic exarchs (not apostolic prefects), but also to retired bishops by way of emeritate (sometimes with a &#x27;promotion&#x27; from a suffragan see to an archiepiscopal titular see; however sometimes transferred to another during an incumbent emeritus bishop&#x27;s life) and even to coadjutor bishops. That practice was largely replaced for the last categories by the present one of referring to a retired bishop as a bishop emeritus of the see that he held, and to a coadjutor bishop simply as coadjutor bishop of the see to which he has been appointed. This change too is reflected in editions of the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; of the period, which include information on renunciation by retired and coadjutor bishops of titular sees to which they had been appointed.

In 1995, when Jacques Gaillot, Bishop of the Diocese of Évreux, who was controversial for his positions on religious, political and social matters, refused to retire and become Bishop Emeritus of Évreux, he was transferred to the titular see of Partenia.

=== Crusader see-in-exile titles ===
The crusading William IV, Count of Nevers, dying in the Holy Land in 1168, left the building known as the Hospital of Panthenor in the town of Clamecy in Burgundy, together with some land, to the Bishops of Bethlehem, in case Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control. After Saladin took Bethlehem in 1187, the Bishop took up residence in 1223 in his property, which remained the seat of titular Bishops of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution of 1789.

The Roman Catholic Archbishopric of Nazareth first had two centuries of Metropolitan Archbishops of Nazareth in Barletta (southern Italy), and gave rise in the 19th century to two separately &#x27;restored&#x27; titular successor sees: a Latin titular archbishopric of Nazareth and a Maronite (Antiochian Rite) titular (Arch)bishopric of Nazareth, both suppressed only in the early 20th century.

The granting of titular sees is occasionally practised in the Eastern and other Orthodox churches.

<text>Operation Southern Focus was a period in the months leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq (called &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot; in the United States) in which the military responses to violations of the southern Iraqi no-fly zones were increased, with more intensive bombing of air defense artillery installations and other military complexes. It also marked a period of increased intelligence gathering. The operation lasted from June 2002 until the beginning of the invasion in March 2003. It was intended to be a &quot;softening up&quot; period prior to invasion, degrading Iraq&#x27;s air defense and communication abilities. Lieutenant General T. Michael Moseley revealed the operation&#x27;s existence in mid-2003.

==Operation==
The operation was not publicly declared at the time, and was just said to be an intensification of the already-existing Operation Southern Watch. When it began, the United States Defense Department and CENTCOM stated that increasing numbers of bombings of Iraqi installations in the region were merely in response to more attacks by the air-defense forces of that country. The Iraqi no-fly zones had been patrolled continuously since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, and bombings by American and coalition fighter aircraft had taken place on a regular basis. However, Southern Focus saw many more engagements. Coalition forces responded to 651 attacks by dropping 606 bombs on 391 targets over the course of the operation.

==Bombs usage==
The tonnage of bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14 tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6 tons in September – prior to Congress&#x27; 11 October authorisation of the invasion. The September attacks included a 5 September 100-aircraft attack on the main air defence site in western Iraq. According to &quot;New Statesman&quot; this was &quot;Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias, it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected.&quot;

==Success==
Iraq&#x27;s only success came on 23 December 2002, when a USAF RQ-1 Predator UAV was experimentally armed with AIM-92 Stingers and sent to patrol the no-fly zone in an attempt to bait Iraqi fighters into combat. It was spotted by two Iraqi MiG-23s and attacked, however both planes were unable to achieve a lock-on. A MiG-25 of the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was then scrambled to assist. Both aircraft fired missiles at each other, however, the Iraqi jet was outside of the range of the Stinger so the American missile fell short. The Iraqi missile hit the Predator, destroying it. This was the first time an unmanned aircraft had been used in air-to-air combat.

The first combat use of the U.S. Navy″s new F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter-bomber occurred in November 2002 during Operation Southern Focus, when aircraft from Strike Fighter Squadron 115 (VFA-115) flying from the aircraft carrier struck surface-to-air missile sites and command and control targets near Al Kut.

<doc id="635920" wikidata="Q999840" url="?curid=635920" title="Bucklin voting">
<text>Bucklin voting is a class of voting methods that can be used for single-member and multi-member districts. As in highest median rules like the majority judgment, the Bucklin winner will be one of the candidates with the highest median ranking or rating. It is named after its original promoter, the Georgist politician James W. Bucklin of Grand Junction, Colorado, and is also known as the Grand Junction system.

==Voting process==
Bucklin rules varied, but here is a typical example:

Voters are allowed rank preference ballots (first, second, third, etc.).

First choice votes are first counted. If one candidate has a majority, that candidate wins. Otherwise the second choices are added to the first choices. Again, if a candidate with a majority vote is found, the winner is the candidate with the most votes accumulated. Lower rankings are added as needed.

A majority is determined based on the number of valid ballots. Since, after the first round, there may be more votes cast than voters, it is possible for more than one candidate to have majority support.

== Variants and relationships to other methods ==
The term &quot;Bucklin voting&quot; refers to the process of counting all votes on all ballots that are above some threshold, and then adjusting that threshold down until a majority is reached. In some variants which have been used, equal ranking was allowed at some or all ranks. Some variants had a predetermined number of ranks available (usually 2 or 3), while others had unlimited ranks. There were also variants akin to Borda voting in that lower-ranked votes counted for less.

The Bucklin procedure is one way to ensure that the winning candidate will be among those with the highest median vote. When used with a cardinal voting scale instead of ordinal ranking, Bucklin&#x27;s balloting method is the same as that of highest median rules like the Majority Judgment. However, Bucklin&#x27;s selection algorithm starts with the highest rated votes and adds lower ones until a median winner is reached, whereas Majority Judgment starts with the median votes and removes them until all but one candidate is eliminated. Due to this difference, Bucklin passes some voting criteria that Majority Judgment fails, and vice versa.

==Bucklin applied to multiwinner elections==
Bucklin was used for multiwinner elections. For multi-member districts, voters marked as many first choices as there are seats to be filled. Voters marked the same number of second and further choices. In some localities, the voter was required to mark a full set of first choices for his or her ballot to be valid. However, allowing voters to cast three simultaneous votes for three seats (block voting) could allow an organized 51%, or the largest minority in a contest with three or more slates, to win all three seats in the first round, so this method does not give proportional representation.

== History and usage ==
The method was proposed by Condorcet in 1793. It was re-invented under its current name and used in many political elections in the United States in the early 20th century, as were other experimental election methods during the Progressive Era. Bucklin voting was first used in 1909 in Grand Junction, Colorado, and then used in more than sixty other cities including Denver and San Francisco.

In two states, it was found to violate the state constitution and overturned; in the remainder of states using it, it was repealed. In Minnesota, it was ruled unconstitutional, in a decision that disallowed votes for multiple candidates, in opposition to some voters&#x27; single expressed preference, and in a variant used in Oklahoma, the particular application required voters in multi-candidate elections to rank more than one candidate, or the vote would not be counted; and the preferential primary was therefore found unconstitutional. The canvassing method itself was not rejected in Oklahoma.
== Satisfied and failed criteria ==
Bucklin voting satisfies the majority criterion, the mutual majority criterion and the monotonicity criterion.

Bucklin voting without equal rankings allowed fails the Condorcet criterion, independence of clones criterion, later-no-harm, participation, consistency, reversal symmetry, the Condorcet loser criterion and the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion.

If equal and skipped rankings are allowed, Bucklin passes or fails the same criteria as highest median rules like the Majority Judgment.

==Example application==


The first round has no majority winner. Therefore, the second rank votes are added. This moves Nashville and Chattanooga above 50%, so a winner can be determined. Since Nashville is supported by a higher majority (68% versus 58%), Nashville is the winner.

== Voter strategy ==
Voters supporting a strong candidate have an incentive to bullet vote (offer only one first-rank vote), in hopes that other voters will add enough votes to help their candidate win. This strategy is most secure if the supported candidate appears likely to gain many second-rank votes.

In the above example, Memphis voters have the most first-place votes and might not offer a second preference in hopes of winning, but the strategy fails, unless other voters also bullet vote, because they are not a second-place choice of competitors.

If all Memphis voters bullet vote, Chattanooga voters could cause their city to win by all bullet voting. However, if all Nashville voters also do the same, Memphis would win on the fourth and final round. In that case, Knoxville voters could do nothing to change the outcome.

In this particular example (but not always), bullet voting benefits one group of voters only if another group or groups do it as well. The example shows that, depending upon who does it, bullet voting may distort the outcome and could be counterproductive for some voters who do it (here, those from Chattanooga and Nashville).

To prevent bullet voting, voters could be required to rank all candidates on the ballot. This would provide the voter with a disincentive to bullet vote, as the vote would not be counted unless all candidates are ranked.

<text>Transconductance (for transfer conductance), also infrequently called mutual [[electrical conductance|conductance]], is the electrical characteristic relating the current through the output of a device to the voltage across the input of a device. Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance.

Transadmittance (or transfer [[admittance]]) is the AC equivalent of transconductance.

== Definition ==

Transconductance is very often denoted as a conductance, , with a subscript, , for &quot;mutual&quot;. It is defined as follows:
: formula_1

For small signal alternating current, the definition is simpler:
: formula_2

The SI unit for transconductance is the siemens, with the symbol S, as in conductance.

== Transresistance ==

Transresistance (for transfer resistance), also infrequently referred to as mutual resistance, is the dual of transconductance. It refers to the ratio between a change of the voltage at two output points and a related change of current through two input points, and is denotated as :
: formula_3

The SI unit for transresistance is simply the ohm, as in resistance.

Transimpedance (or, transfer impedance) is the AC equivalent of transresistance, and is the dual of transadmittance.

For vacuum tubes, transconductance is defined as the change in the plate (anode) current divided by the corresponding change in the grid/cathode voltage, with a constant plate (anode) to cathode voltage. Typical values of for a small-signal vacuum tube are 1 to . It is one of the three characteristic constants of a vacuum tube, the other two being its gain (mu) and plate resistance or . The Van der Bijl equation defines their relation as follows:
: formula_4

=== Field-effect transistors ===
Similarly, in field-effect transistors, and MOSFETs in particular, transconductance is the change in the drain current divided by the small change in the gate–source voltage with a constant drain–source voltage. Typical values of for a small-signal field-effect transistor are .

Using the Shichman–Hodges model, the transconductance for the MOSFET can be expressed as (see &quot;&quot;)
: formula_5
where is the DC drain current at the bias point, and is the overdrive voltage, which is the difference between the bias point gate–source voltage and the threshold voltage (i.e., ). The overdrive voltage (sometimes known as the effective voltage) is customarily chosen at about 70–200 mV for the 65 nm process node () for a of 11–32 mS/μm.

Additionally, the transconductance for the junction FET is given by 
: formula_6
where is the pinchoff voltage, and is the maximum drain current.

=== Bipolar transistors ===
The of bipolar small-signal transistors varies widely, being proportional to the collector current. It has a typical range of . The input voltage change is applied between the base/emitter and the output is the change in collector current flowing between the collector/emitter with a constant collector/emitter voltage.

The transconductance for the bipolar transistor can be expressed as
: formula_7
where is the DC collector current at the Q-point, and is the thermal voltage, typically about at room temperature. For a typical current of , . The input impedance is the current gain () divided by the transconductance.

The output (collector) conductance is determined by the Early voltage and is proportional to the collector current. For most transistors in linear operation it is well below .

== Amplifiers ==

=== Transconductance amplifiers ===
A transconductance amplifier (&quot;g&quot; amplifier) puts out a current proportional to its input voltage. In network analysis, the transconductance amplifier is defined as a &quot;&quot; (). These amplifiers are commonly seen installed in a cascode configuration, which improves the frequency response.

An ideal transconductance amplifier in a voltage follower configuration behaves at the output like a resistor of value , between a buffered copy of the input voltage and the output. If the follower is loaded by a single capacitor , the voltage follower transfer function has a single pole with time constant , or equivalently it behaves as a 1st-order low-pass filter with a bandwidth of .

==== Operational transconductance amplifiers ====

An operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is an integrated circuit which can function as a transconductance amplifier. These normally have an input to allow the transconductance to be controlled.

=== Transresistance amplifiers ===

A transresistance amplifier outputs a voltage proportional to its input current. The transresistance amplifier is often referred to as a transimpedance amplifier, especially by semiconductor manufacturers.

The term for a transresistance amplifier in network analysis is &quot;current controlled voltage source&quot; (&quot;CCVS&quot;).

A basic inverting transresistance amplifier can be built from an operational amplifier and a single resistor. Simply connect the resistor between the output and the inverting input of the operational amplifier and connect the non-inverting input to ground. The output voltage will then be proportional to the input current at the inverting input, decreasing with increasing input current and vice versa. 

Specialist chip transresistance (transimpedance) amplifiers are widely used for amplifying the signal current from photo diodes at the receiving end of ultra high speed fibre optic links.

<doc id="635927" wikidata="Q2366935" url="?curid=635927" title="Pittsburgh Maulers (1984)">
<text>The Pittsburgh Maulers were a team that competed in the 1984 season of the United States Football League. Their most prominent player was first pick overall in the 1984 USFL Draft, running back Mike Rozier of Nebraska, who won the Heisman Trophy, collegiate football&#x27;s most prestigious individual award.

They were owned by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr., the father of Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr., then-owner of the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League and the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. The Maulers played at Three Rivers Stadium.

==History==

No one was surprised when two groups filed for a Pittsburgh franchise in the winter of 1983. It did come as a considerable surprise that DeBartolo, Sr. was one of them, given his son&#x27;s ownership of the 49ers. However, while the other group contented itself with holding a rally to demonstrate support for a potential franchise, DeBartolo stole a march by securing an all-important lease for Three Rivers Stadium. A few days later, DeBartolo&#x27;s longtime right-hand man, former Steeler Paul Martha, informed the other owners and Commissioner Chet Simmons that his boss was not only applying for a franchise, but already had a lease.

There was some debate over whether to approve DeBartolo&#x27;s bid, with some fearing that they were effectively allowing an NFL owner into their circle. It was an open secret that Eddie, Sr. and Eddie, Jr. worked closely together. Ultimately, the owners realized that DeBartolo would lend the upstart league instant credibility and unanimously approved his bid, making him the first owner of a USFL expansion team. Unusually, DeBartolo applied for the franchise in his own name, rather than setting up a corporation or partnership. He also paid the full $6.25 million expansion fee up front. A name-the-team contest yielded the nickname &quot;Maulers,&quot; after the sledgehammer-wielding workers in steel foundries.

The NFL itself threatened an investigation over a possible Cleveland Spiders-style conflict of interest due to the father owning a USFL team and the son owning an NFL team, an accusation both father and son insisted was not the case. Ultimately, the NFL asked Eddie, Jr. to leave the room during any USFL discussions.

DeBartolo immediately made waves by beginning talks with Dan Marino, a Pittsburgh native and the quarterback for the hometown Pitt Panthers (he ultimately signed with the NFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins). Joe Pendry, the offensive coordinator for the 1983 finalist Philadelphia Stars, became head coach.

The Maulers opened their home season with a March 11, 1984 sellout crowd at Three Rivers Stadium facing the Birmingham Stallions, a team led by Cliff Stoudt, who had spent much of the previous season as the starter for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and had been Terry Bradshaw&#x27;s backup for years before then. Fans bombarded Stoudt with snowballs and ice whenever the Stallions entered the red zone. The Maulers lost, 30-18, in what would be the team&#x27;s only sellout.

The team finished 3–15, tying the Washington Federals for the worst record in the league. However, while undermanned, they were not nearly as bad as their record indicated. They were in part victims of a very tough schedule. They played nine games against playoff teams and caught a lot of the other teams when they were hot—Oklahoma and New Orleans early and San Antonio and Jacksonville late. Seven of their losses were by fewer than 10 points.

The team was built around the idea that Dallas Cowboys longtime third-string QB Glenn Carano would be a strong starter in the USFL. To support Carano, the team had RB Mike Rozier–the second straight Heisman Trophy winner to sign with a USFL team–and WR Greg Anderson, who caught 63 passes. Carano had his moments but he struggled overall, completing only 53.7% of his passes with 13 touchdowns and 19 interceptions. Backup Tom Rozantz was expected to mostly carry a clipboard, but he ended up playing a lot and he struggled as well. However, either would have been a disappointment, as most fans expected the Maulers to pick Steve Young rather than Mike Rozier. Even bringing in former Arizona Wranglers star WR Jackie Flowers did not turn around the offense. The defense, led by CB Jerry Holmes and DE Sam Clancy finished a respectable eighth in points allowed. In spite of this, they were hobbled by a low-octane offense.

In the middle of a 17-7 loss to the Memphis Showboats, DeBartolo told general manager George Heddleston to tell Pendry to yank Carano in favor of backup Tom Rozantz. Pendry refused to do so, even when Carano dislocated his right arm and could not throw without &quot;tremendous pain&quot; shooting through it. A fuming DeBartolo ordered Heddleston and Pendry to meet with him at his office in Youngstown, Ohio the next morning. Pendry refused to come, and quit rather than be fired. Offensive line coach Ellis Rainsberger took over as interim coach for the rest of the season.

They closed the season against Jacksonville in a torrential rainstorm; one sideline of the Gator Bowl was so badly flooded that both teams had to share the other sideline.

===Vote for a fall schedule kills franchise===

Despite losing millions of dollars and only winning three games, the Maulers were competitive in most games. They also attracted 22,858 per game, a respectable figure—at least by USFL standards—for an expansion team. DeBartolo was determined to stick it out, even going as far as hiring Hank Bullough away from the Green Bay Packers to become the new head coach. The fan support in such a strong sports town such as Pittsburgh can be attributed to a combination of factors. At the time the Maulers arrived, the Steelers were in the middle of an on-field decline following their 1970s dominance. The Penguins were all but invisible in the Pittsburgh market (though the team had just drafted Mario Lemieux). The Pittsburgh Pirates were experiencing an on- and off-field collapse that would be topped off by the 1985 Pittsburgh drug trials and the team nearly relocating to Denver.

However, just a few days after Bullough&#x27;s hiring, the USFL voted to switch to a fall schedule in 1986. DeBartolo was a strong believer in the USFL&#x27;s original spring football concept, and he knew the Maulers could not hope to go head-to-head against the Steelers. Sharing Three Rivers Stadium would have caused serious logistical problems early in the fall, with the Maulers, Pirates and Steelers fighting for dates. A move to Cleveland, closer to DeBartolo&#x27;s home in Youngstown, was quickly ruled out; even without the daunting task of going head-to-head with the Cleveland Browns (then a solid playoff team) to consider, similar conflicts with the Cleveland Indians sharing Cleveland Stadium at the time rendered this potential move impractical as well.

As a result, just a week after the vote to move to the fall, DeBartolo decided to fold the team without so much as a press conference. He announced that he intended to merge the Maulers with another team. Initially, he struck a merger agreement with the Stars, who had been forced to move to Baltimore after concluding they could not compete with the NFL&#x27;s Eagles. However, just months later, at the urging of his wife Marie, DeBartolo sold his stake in the Stars and got out of the league entirely. The league&#x27;s abandonment of Pittsburgh was later cited as a factor in the USFL failing to secure a large judgment in its antitrust suit against the NFL; although it technically won, the jury only awarded it $3 in damages.

Amidst several USFL teams that were &quot;one-season wonders&quot; as a result of relocating, merging with other teams and/or changing team names (all off-season), the Pittsburgh Maulers have the distinction of being the only USFL team to play with no connections to any other cities or teams, neither before nor after their only season.

<doc id="635928" wikidata="Q5333295" url="?curid=635928" title="Ecology of California">
<text>The ecology of California can be understood by dividing the state into a number of ecoregions, which contain distinct ecological communities of plants and animals in a contiguous region. The ecoregions of California can be grouped into four major groups: desert ecoregions (such as the Mojave Desert), Mediterranean ecoregions (such as the Central Valley), forested mountains (such as the Sierra Nevada), and coastal forests.

Different authorities define the boundaries of ecoregions somewhat differently: this article follows the definitions of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

==Deserts==

California&#x27;s high mountains block most moisture from reaching the eastern parts of the state, which are home to California&#x27;s desert and xeric shrub ecoregions. The low desert of southeastern California is part of the Sonoran Desert ecoregion, which extends into Arizona and parts of northern Mexico. California has two high deserts: the Mojave Desert and the Great Basin Desert. The Mojave Desert ecoregion is marked by the presence of Joshua trees. The dry cold Great Basin desert of California consists of the Owens Valley, and is classified into Great Basin shrub steppe by the WWF, and into the Central Basin and Range ecoregion by the EPA.

The deserts in California receive between of rain per year. Plants in these deserts are brush and scrub, adapted to the low rainfall. Common plant species include creosote bush, blackbrush, greasewood, saltbush, big sagebrush, low sagebrush, and shadscale. Higher elevations have more precipitation, which allows drought-resistant trees to grow, such as western juniper and pinyon pine.

==Mediterranean ecoregions==

The coast of California from Monterey Bay south to the Mexican border, and inland from San Francisco Bay Area to the Sierra Nevada foothills contain California&#x27;s Mediterranean ecoregions. This region is divided by the WWF into three California chaparral and woodlands ecoregions, plus the Central Valley grasslands. The EPA divides the region between the Central Valley (ecoregion 7), the Southern California chaparral (ecoregion 6), the Southern California mountains (ecoregion 8), and the Southern California coast (ecoregion 85).

The WWF distinguishes between different chaparral ecoregions based on species endemism. In the south, the California coastal sage and chaparral extends across the Mexican border into northwestern Baja California and Los Angeles. The coastal sage ecoregion is notable for having the highest number of native bees in the United States, although much of the ecoregion is now urbanized. The California montane chaparral and woodlands include the Transverse Ranges north of Los Angeles as well as the Santa Lucia Range on the Central Coast. The montane chaparral consists of a mosaic of sage scrub, chaparral, and montane species, depending on altitude. The California interior chaparral and woodlands form a ring around the Central Valley, covering the hills around the Bay Area as well as the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The interior woodland ecoregion contains several endemic species, due to unique soil types such as serpentine.
These chaparral ecoregions contain numerous plant communities, including oak savanna, oak woodland, conifer woodlands, chamise chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and coastal grassland. These plant communities often occur as a mosaic, caused by fire.

California&#x27;s Central Valley was once a large temperate grassland containing native bunchgrasses and vernal pools. Grizzly bear, gray wolf, tule elk, and pronghorn antelope used to inhabit the grasslands. The native grasslands and pools have now been largely replaced by livestock ranches and farms. The Carrizo Plain, where the native grass is preserved, is referred to as the &quot;Serengeti of California&quot;.

==Forested mountains==

The cooler and wetter mountains of northern California are covered by forest ecoregions. Both the WWF and the EPA divide the mountains into three ecoregions: the Sierra Nevada, the Klamath Mountains, and the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills (occurring on the Modoc Plateau).

The Sierra Nevada are home to half of the vascular plant species of California, with 400 species that are endemic to the region. Like many mountain ranges, the plant communities of the Sierra group into biotic zones by altitude, because of the increasingly harsh climate as elevation increases. These biotic zones include montane forest dominated by conifers such as Jeffrey pine and Lodgepole pine, subalpine forest dominated by whitebark pine, up to alpine tundra which cannot support trees. The Sierra are also notable for giant sequoia trees: the most massive on earth.

The Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains are a notable biodiversity hotspot, containing one of the four most biodiverse temperate forests in the world. The diversity is caused by the ecoregion being adjacent to a number of other ecoregions, diverse soil, and having refugia caused by isolation in the last ice age. Some endemic species in the Klamath mountains are limited to only one mountain or valley.

The Eastern Cascades slopes of the Modoc Plateau are characterized by a mosaic of open ponderosa pine forest, grasslands, and shrublands. Although high, these slopes and mountains are in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range, and hence are drier and more open.

==Coastal forests==

The coast of California north of San Francisco contains the Northern California coastal forests (as defined by the WWF) and the southern section of the Coast Range ecoregion (as defined by the EPA). This ecoregion is dominated by redwood forest, containing the tallest and some of the oldest trees in the world.

The redwood forests thrive in a thin belt up to wide next to the coast, where the trees are kept moist by winter rains and summer fog. The redwood forests are also notable for having the highest forest productivity in the world.

<doc id="635932" wikidata="Q5343636" url="?curid=635932" title="Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.">
<text>Edward John DeBartolo Jr. (born November 6, 1946) is an American businessman best known for his 23-year ownership of the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). The five Super Bowls the 49ers dynasty won in 14 years were a record total for a single owner. 

On February 6, 2016, DeBartolo was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a contributor.

DeBartolo was involved in the 1998 corruption case of Edwin Edwards, former governor of Louisiana. DeBartolo pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to report a felony, and received a $1 million fine and two years of probation in return for his testimony against Edwards. DeBartolo was fined by the NFL, and barred from active control of the 49ers for a year. On February 18, 2020, President Donald Trump granted DeBartolo a presidential pardon.

==Career==
DeBartolo developed shopping malls as part of a corporation founded by his father, Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation became one of the largest public real estate businesses in the United States, at one point controlling over two billion square feet of retail real estate space nationwide.

In addition, DeBartolo was actively involved in franchise ownership and sports management, becoming one of the most successful and generous owners in professional sports. His ownership of the 49ers proved especially notable. During DeBartolo&#x27;s 23 years owning the team, beginning in 1977, the 49ers won an unprecedented five Super Bowls under coaches Bill Walsh and George Seifert: Super Bowl XVI in 1982, XIX in 1985, XXIII in 1989, XXIV 1990, and XXIX in 1995. From the early 1980s through the mid-1990s, DeBartolo presided over a team that had the most wins within a decade in football history.

According to 49ers quarterback Steve Young, DeBartolo&#x27;s &quot;family approach&quot; to running the team changed the landscape of the NFL. Under it, &quot;the players were what mattered&quot;, and that changed the face of the sport as other teams began to follow the 49ers&#x27; model. &quot;In most of the league, the players were chattel. What I see in the league today are owners who have made their players partners. That changes the nature of the NFL.&quot; 

DeBartolo affirms this, saying: &quot;I tried to run the 49ers like a family rather than a business. I viewed the players and myself really, basically, as a partnership. Our goal was to win the Super Bowl every year, and we had to do that together.&quot;

===Financial and legal troubles===
In 1991, DeBartolo arranged to sell the family-owned Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League franchise to assist the DeBartolo Corporation in the aftermath of the real estate collapse of 1987. His sister, Denise DeBartolo York, had served as president. Five years later, many family-owned shopping malls were sold to the Simon Property Group, which operated for a few years as the Simon DeBartolo Group.

In 1992, DeBartolo was accused of sexual assault at his Menlo Park condo by a cocktail waitress he met at a local bar. The married DeBartolo, who denied any wrongdoing, was never charged but reportedly paid $200,000 to settle the case out of court.

DeBartolo was involved in the 1998 corruption case of Edwin Edwards, former governor of Louisiana. DeBartolo pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to report a felony, and received a $1 million fine and two years of probation in return for his testimony against Edwards. Edwards was on trial for extortion and other charges, among which were the $400,000 he demanded from DeBartolo to gain a riverboat casino license. DeBartolo received the license, but withdrew from the casino project after he was subpoenaed during the subsequent bribery investigation. DeBartolo was fined by the NFL, and barred from active control of the 49ers for a year.

DeBartolo could have returned to the team, but instead ceded control of the franchise to his sister, Denise York, in 2000, in return for other parts of the family business empire. In spite of the public perception that the transfer had been forced by the league, DeBartolo confirms it was voluntary:

...Truthfully, the team really wasn&#x27;t taken away from me. I think it&#x27;s been a misnomer for many many years. Commissioner Tagliabue did obviously suspend me, but as I was going through negotiations with my family and we went through these negotiations and we went through them with lawyers, obviously and with a judge in Akron, Ohio. It did not come down to that team being taken, it came down to a decision that had to be made whether or not I wanted the 49ers or whether or not I wanted to take the other part of the company. And I figured at that time, and my sister Denise (49ers owner Denise York) was involved totally as was her family. I decided in that meeting in Akron Ohio, that I thought it would be best that I took the other side and my tenure with the 49ers would end then and end there. I don&#x27;t know if that story has ever been told, it may have been, it may have not been. But, it really was a choice, I figured there was more to do with my life at that time. I had succeeded and done a lot with the 49ers. It meant the world to me, but I figured with my daughters, with them getting older and obviously with all of us getting older and having grandchildren at the time, and them planning on families, that it would be best for me to do what was best to be a good grandfather, be a good husband and dad, and do what I want to do and maybe travel a little bit and spend more time with my family.

Hall of Fame offensive tackle Anthony Muñoz of the Cincinnati Bengals attended a celebrity flag football game at Candlestick Park in 2014 — the last football event before the 49ers&#x27; old home was torn down, where he said:

The final touchdown pass, there were probably 30,000 people in that stadium viewing a bunch of old guys playing a flag football game, but to see (Montana) throw to (DeBartolo) for the final touchdown there and to hear the fans go crazy and to see the admiration from these former players like Ronnie Lott and Joe Montana; that to me was impressive ... to me, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.

On February 18, 2020, President Donald Trump granted DeBartolo a presidential pardon.

==Personal life==
DeBartolo was born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio, the son of Marie Patricia (Montani) and Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., a real estate developer. He went to high school at Cardinal Mooney. 

DeBartolo and his wife, Candy, have three daughters: Lisa, Nicole, and Tiffanie. Tiffanie is an author and the director of the film &quot;Dream for an Insomniac&quot; (1996). In 2007, DeBartolo co-founded Brooks-DeBartolo Collegiate High School in Tampa, Florida with fellow Pro Football Hall of Fame member Derrick Brooks.

DeBartolo also has a half-brother, Edward M. Kobel, who is the current president and COO of DeBartolo Development.

DeBartolo&#x27;s mother was Marie Patricia Montani DeBartolo, in whose honor the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center at the University of Notre Dame was posthumously dedicated.

On December 1st 2024, Donald Trump nominated DeBartolo&#x27;s son-in-law Chad Chronister, Sheriff of Hillsborough County, FL, as head of the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

The park has extensive hiking trails on the mountainside, featuring large glacial boulders and outcroppings from the Wisconsin glaciation approximately 21,000 years ago.

It is said that the park was named after a girl named Jenny, who jumped to her death on Jenny Jump Mountain, while being chased by a Native American.

==Environment==
The park&#x27;s forests are part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.

==Facilities==
The park grounds include the Greenwood Observatory, built by the United Astronomy Clubs of New Jersey (UACNJ) in 1995. The observatory is open for public stargazing on Saturday nights April through October. There are several other observatories located at Jenny Jump, including the Brady which houses a 178MM Refractor and a solar observatory. The area is used by many amateur astro photographers as Jenny Jump has some of the darkest skies in New Jersey.

The park has camping facilities April to October, and shelters available all year long.

<text>The Edinburgh Mathematical Society is a mathematical society for academics in Scotland.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1883 by a group of Edinburgh school teachers and academics, on the initiative of Alexander Yule Fraser FRSE and Andrew Jeffrey Gunion Barclay FRSE, both maths teachers at George Watson&#x27;s College, and Cargill Gilston Knott, the assistant of Peter Guthrie Tait, professor of physics at the University of Edinburgh. The first president, elected at first meeting on 2 February 1883, was J.S. Mackay, the head mathematics master at the Edinburgh Academy.

The Society was founded at a time when mathematics societies were being created around the world, but it was unusual in being founded by school teachers rather than university lecturers. This was because, due to the very small number of mathematical academic positions in Scotland at the time, many skilled mathematics graduates chose to become schoolteachers instead. The fifty five founding members contained teachers, ministers and students, as well as a number of academics from the University of Cambridge. The proportion of teachers remained high compared to other mathematical societies, and by 1926 university members made up only one-third of the total members. However, the dominance of teachers in the numbers of the society declined towards the 1930s, and between 1930 and 1935 no papers were presented in the &quot;Proceedings&quot; by teachers. This was due to an increase in the number of academic positions available and the new requirement for teachers to undergo an additional year of vocational training.

The Edinburgh Mathematical Society is now mainly for academics.

==Activity==
The Society organises and funds meetings and other research events throughout Scotland. There are normally eight meetings a year, at which talks are presented by mathematicians.

Every four years it awards the Sir Edmund Whittaker Memorial Prize to an outstanding mathematician with a Scottish connection. The Society is a corporate member of the European Mathematical Society, and in 2008 it became a member of the Council for the Mathematical Sciences.

==Journals==
The society releases an academic journal, the &quot;Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press (ISSN 0013–0915.) The &quot;Proceedings&quot; were first published in 1884, and are issued three times a year, covering a range of pure and applied mathematics subjects.

Between 1909 and 1961, the Society also published the &quot;Edinburgh Mathematical Notes&quot;, on the suggestion of George Alexander Gibson, a professor at the University of Glasgow, who wished to remove the more elementary or pedagogical articles from the &quot;Proceedings&quot;.

<doc id="635942" wikidata="Q2882353" url="?curid=635942" title="Tampa Bay Bandits">
<text>The Tampa Bay Bandits were a professional American football team in the United States Football League (USFL) which was based in Tampa, Florida. The Bandits were a charter member of the USFL and was the only franchise to have the same principal owner (John F. Bassett), head coach (Steve Spurrier), and home field (Tampa Stadium) during the league&#x27;s three seasons of play (1983–1985). The Bandits were one of the most successful teams in the short-lived spring football league both on the field and at the ticket booth. Spurrier&#x27;s &quot;Bandit Ball&quot; offense led them to three winning seasons and two playoff appearances, and their exciting brand of play combined with innovative local marketing helped the Bandits lead the league in attendance. However, the franchise folded along with the rest of the USFL when the league suspended play after the 1985 season.

Prominent alumni from the Bandits include future NFL Pro Bowlers Nate Newton and Gary Anderson and coach Steve Spurrier, who spent 25 years coaching college football after his successful first stint as a head coach with the Bandits and was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame.

==History==

===Preparing to play===

====Origins====
The Tampa Bay Bandits&#x27; primary founder was Canadian businessman John F. Bassett, who was still in litigation against the NFL over his previous Memphis Southmen franchise from the World Football League in the mid-1970s. Bassett was initially skeptical about getting into another football venture. However, he soon warmed up to the USFL after discovering that he was nowhere as well off as the other owners. While he had been by far the richest owner in the WFL, he realized that he would be one of the poorest owners in the USFL. Believing that the USFL was on far stronger financial ground than the WFL ever had been, he agreed to sign on. Bassett had a part-time home in the Tampa Bay Area, and when the USFL announced its twelve charter franchises in May 1982, Bassett was introduced as the majority owner of the as-yet unnamed team in Tampa along with Miami attorney Steve Arky.

====Establishment in Tampa====
After it was decided that the franchise would play in Tampa, several minority owners bought stakes, among them Hollywood star Burt Reynolds, a former college football player at Florida State who was one of the most popular motion picture actors in the world. The team was soon dubbed the &quot;Bandits&quot;, and although it was widely assumed that the name referenced Reynolds&#x27; role in the hit &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; movies, Bassett said that the mascot had been chosen before Reynolds joined the ownership group and instead came from the name of Bassett&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s German Shepherd. Reynolds was prominently involved in the Bandits&#x27; early marketing campaigns, and the cover of the team&#x27;s first media guide featured a photo of the actor wearing a Bandits jacket and trucker hat.

Also building interest was the hiring of Steve Spurrier as head coach and offensive coordinator in November 1982. Spurrier was well known in the area as a Heisman Trophy-winning college star for the University of Florida Gators and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; first starting quarterback, and had most recently spent three seasons as a record-setting offensive coordinator at Duke University before accepting his first head coaching job with the Bandits. Though Bassett had also considered several established coaches with NFL experience, he chose Spurrier due to his deep connections to the state of Florida and his reputation as an innovative young offensive coach; Spurrier was 37 when hired, making him the youngest head coach in professional football at the time. At Spurrier&#x27;s introductory press conference, Bassett joked that he knew that he&#x27;d found the right coach when he discovered that the Spurrier family also had a dog named Bandit.

===Bandit Ball===
The Bandits began play in 1983 in Tampa Stadium, and were immediately more successful than the area&#x27;s NFL franchise, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with whom they shared a home field (though the Bucs played in the fall and early winter while the Bandits played in the spring and early summer). The Bandits narrowly missed the playoffs in their first season and made the postseason the next two years. Spurrier&#x27;s aggressive offense was usually one of the best in the league; Bandits players are among the USFL career leaders in touchdown passes (John Reaves, 4th), touchdown receptions (Eric Truvillion, 2nd), and rushing touchdowns (Gary Anderson, 3rd). However, an average defense and Bassett&#x27;s insistence on adhering to the USFL&#x27;s original financial plan while other franchises spent millions on free agent signings kept the team from serious championship contention.

The Bandits were also successful off the field. They drew the highest average attendance over the three-year history of the USFL, coming in second in attendance in 1983 and leading the league in that category in 1984 and 1985 with over 40,000 fans per game. Also, their memorabilia outsold that of the Buccaneers in the Tampa Bay area. A fan-friendly atmosphere (including a theme song, &quot;Bandit Ball&quot;, penned and sung by Reynolds&#x27; friend Jerry Reed) was one factor, and the Bucs&#x27; futility during the period (they went 10–38 from 1983 to 1985—the start of a 12-year stretch of 10-loss seasons) also helped the Bandits&#x27; success. Another key factor in the Bandits&#x27; success was the fact that there was no Major League Baseball team in Tampa at the time (the Tampa Bay Devil Rays would not debut for another decade), meaning that unlike other USFL teams, they did not have to compete with a baseball team for spectators. Due to broad local support, the Bandits were one of a very few USFL teams with a stable home and steady finances - they were the only franchise to have the same coach, owner, and home city throughout the league&#x27;s three-year existence. Due to these factors, the Bandits are considered one of the few USFL teams that had the potential to be a viable venture had the league been better run. The Philadelphia Stars played Tampa Bay at Wembley Stadium in an exhibition game on July 21, 1984.

In week three of the 1984 season, the Bandits faced their inter-state rivals, the Jacksonville Bulls for the first time. Jacksonville was 1-1, after soundly defeating the Washington Federals and nearly beating the New Jersey Generals. Jacksonville, led by former Jets and Broncos quarterback Matt Robinson, raced out to a 12–0 lead. The Bandits stormed back to take a 25–18 lead. The Bulls came back to tie the game, but the Bandits won when Zenon Andrusyshyn kicked a field goal to give Tampa Bay a 28–25 lead.

When the season was over, quarterback John Reaves was the leading passer on the squad. Running backs Greg Boone and Gary Anderson ran for 1,009 and 1,008 yards respectively. Eric Truvillion lead the receivers with 1,044 yards on 70 catches and nine touchdowns.

===The end of the Bandits and of the USFL===
Bandits&#x27; majority owner John Bassett was a strong proponent of the &quot;Dixon Plan&quot;, which was a plan formulated by the USFL&#x27;s founding owners that sought to build a sustainable league with budgetary restraint and a commitment to spring football. However, to gain a competitive advantage and draw attention to their teams, some owners attempted to sign more high-profile players to free agent contracts, sometimes engaging in bidding wars against more financially powerful NFL teams. This led to USFL teams losing substantial amounts of money, causing much instability throughout the league. The Bandits did not overspend on player contracts, keeping the franchise stable but making it difficult to compete with the USFL&#x27;s higher-spending teams, despite making a very good account of themselves on the field.

In April 1985, the USFL (led by New Jersey Generals owner Donald Trump) voted 12–2 to switch to a fall schedule for 1986, hoping to compete directly with the NFL and possibly force the more established league to accept a merger. Bassett, who had registered one of the two &quot;nay&quot; votes, immediately declared his intention to pull the Bandits out of the USFL and organize a new spring football league.

However, by mid-1985, the Bandits&#x27; ownership group was in disarray. Bassett was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and staffers suspected that his illness was impairing his judgment. At the same time, co-owner Steve Arky&#x27;s wealth was raided by the Securities and Exchange Commission on fraud charges, triggering the savings and loan crisis; Arky committed suicide not long after. The team began signing mediocre players, most infamously defensive back Bret Clark, to large contracts, and plans for a new spring football league were abandoned. The size of the contracts, particularly Clark&#x27;s contract, along with Bassett&#x27;s bizarre proposal for his spin-off league to be a multi-sport league, led Spurrier and other team officials to question whether Bassett was acting or thinking rationally. As his condition worsened, Bassett decided to sell the team. He died in May 1986. Before his death, he unsuccessfully tried to merge the Bandits organization with the Orlando Renegades (whose owner Donald Dizney had previously held a stake in the Bandits, but rejected the merger out of loyalty to Orlando) and Jacksonville Bulls (whose owner Fred Bullard expressed interest, but only if the Bandits owners stayed on as investors in the merged team).

In August 1985, minority owner Lee Scarfone, a local architect, agreed to purchase Bassett&#x27;s and Arky&#x27;s stakes and field a team in the USFL for the fall 1986 season, with Tony Cunningham coming on as an additional partner. In March 1986, Bret Clark took the Bandits to arbitration for $159,980 in back pay owed under his contract. He won the case on May 29, but the Bandits did not have any funds available to pay the judgement, as Scarfone and Cunningham had gone into considerable debt to buy the team and had already depleted most of their assets. On August 4, a federal judge placed a lien on the franchise and ordered that the franchise&#x27;s remaining assets - including everything from weight-lifting equipment to office furniture to memorabilia from the team store - be confiscated to pay off the debt, all but ending any realistic chance of the Bandits returning to the field. With the USFL failing to win the necessary money from its antitrust lawsuit to continue operating, and suddenly without one of its most financially successful franchises, the league suspended operations the same day, never returning to play.

==Proposed revivals==
*In February 2014, the A-11 Football League (A11FL) announced its intention to revive the Tampa Bay Bandits name and logos as one of the eight charter franchises for a new spring league. The A11FL also announced plans to feature the revived Bandits in a &quot;showcase game&quot; to be held at Tampa&#x27;s Raymond James Stadium in May 2014. However, these plans did not come to fruition, as the A11FL never took the field. The showcase game was cancelled in March 2014, and the league went on permanent &quot;hiatus&quot; in July 2014.

*The Spring League acquired the trademarks of the Bandits in 2021 as part of a planned relaunch of the USFL and included a Bandits squad in its 2022 USFL season. The 2022 Bandits are based in Tampa Bay in name only, as the entire league plays all of its games in Birmingham, Alabama.

<text>Tampa Bay is a large natural harbor and shallow estuary connected to the Gulf of Mexico on the west-central coast of Florida, comprising Hillsborough Bay, McKay Bay, Old Tampa Bay, Middle Tampa Bay, and Lower Tampa Bay. The largest freshwater inflow into the bay is the Hillsborough River, which flows into Hillsborough Bay in downtown Tampa. Many other smaller rivers and streams also flow into Tampa Bay, resulting in a large watershed area.

The shores of Tampa Bay were home to the Weeden Island Culture and then the Safety Harbor culture for thousands of years. These cultures relied heavily on Tampa Bay for food, and the waters were rich enough that they were one of the few Native American cultures that did not have to farm. The Tocobaga was likely the dominant chiefdom in the area when Spanish explorers arrived in the early 1500s, but there were likely smaller chiefdoms on the eastern side of the bay which were not well documented. The indigenous population had been decimated by disease and warfare by the late 1600s, and there were no permanent human settlements in the area for over a century. The United States took possession of Florida in 1821 and established Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River in 1824.

The communities surrounding Tampa Bay grew tremendously during the 20th century. Today, the area is home to about 4 million residents, making Tampa Bay a heavily used commercial and recreational waterway and subjecting it to increasing amounts of pollutants from industry, agriculture, sewage, and surface runoff. The bay&#x27;s water quality was seriously degraded by the early 1980s, resulting in a sharp decline in sea life and decreased availability for recreational use. Greater care has been taken in recent decades to mitigate the effects of human habitation on Tampa Bay, most notably upgraded sewage treatment facilities and several sea grass restoration projects, resulting in improved water quality over time. However, occasional red tide and other algae blooms have caused concern about the ongoing health of the estuary.

The term &quot;Tampa Bay&quot; is often used as shorthand to refer to all or parts of the Tampa Bay area, which comprises many towns and cities in several counties surrounding the large body of water. Local marketing and branding efforts (including several professional sports teams, tourist boards, and chambers of commerce) commonly use the moniker &quot;Tampa Bay&quot;, furthering the misconception that it is the name of a particular municipality when this is not the case.

==Geography==
===Origin===
Tampa Bay formed approximately 6,000 years ago as a brackish drowned river valley type estuary with a wide mouth connecting it to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to that time, it was a large fresh water lake, possibly fed by the Floridan Aquifer through natural springs. Though the exact process of the lake-to-bay transformation is not completely understood, the leading theory is that rising sea levels following the last ice age coupled with the formation of a massive sink hole near the current mouth of the bay created a connection between the lake and the gulf.

===Ecology===
Tampa Bay is Florida&#x27;s largest open-water estuary, extending over and forming coastlines of Hillsborough, Manatee and Pinellas counties. The freshwater sources of the bay are distributed among over a hundred small tributaries, rather than a single river. The Hillsborough River is the largest such freshwater source, with the Alafia, Manatee, and Little Manatee rivers the next largest sources. Because of these many flows into the bay, its large watershed covers portions of five Florida counties and approximately .

The bottom of Tampa Bay is silty and sandy, with an average water depth of only about . The relatively shallow water and tidal mud flats allow for large sea grass beds, and along with the surrounding mangrove-dominated wetlands, the bay provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. More than 200 species of fish are found in the waters of the bay, along with bottlenose dolphins and manatees, plus many types of marine invertebrates including oysters, scallops, clams, shrimp and crab. More than two dozen species of birds, including brown pelicans, several types of heron and egret, Roseate spoonbills, cormorants, and laughing gulls make their year-round home along its shores and small islands, with several other migratory species joining them in the winter. The cooler months are also when warm-water outfalls from power plants bordering the bay draw one out of every six West Indian manatees, an endangered species, to the area.

=== Environmental issues ===

==== Conservation ====
Tampa Bay was designated as an &quot;estuary of national significance&quot; by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1990. Two National Wildlife Refuges are located in Tampa Bay: Pinellas National Wildlife Refuge and the refuge on Egmont Key. Most of the islands (including several man-made islands built from dredge spoil) and sandbars are off-limits to the public, due to their fragile ecology and their use as nesting sites by many species of birds. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program keeps watch over the Bay&#x27;s health.

==== Pollution ====
Tampa Bay was once teeming with fish and wildlife. People of the Safety Harbor culture lived almost entirely from mullet, shellfish, sea turtles, manatees, crabs, and other bounties harvested from the sea. As late as the early 20th century, visitors still reported huge schools of mullet swimming across the bay in such numbers that they &quot;impeded the passage of boats&quot;.

The establishment and rapid growth of surrounding communities during the 20th century caused serious damage to the bay&#x27;s natural environment. Heavy harvesting of fish and other sea life, constant dredging of shipping channels, and the clearing of mangroves for shoreline development were important factors. Most damaging was the discharge of waste water and other pollutants into the bay, which drastically degraded water quality. The bay&#x27;s health reached a low point in the 1970s. The water was so murky that sunlight could not reach the shallow bottom, reducing sea grass coverage by more than 80% compared to earlier in the century and severely impacting the marine ecosystem. Many previously common species became scarce, and bay beaches were regularly closed due to unsafe levels of bacteria and pollutants.

Beginning in the early 1980s after federal and state legislation to improve water quality, authorities installed improved water treatment plants and tightened regulation of industrial discharge, leading to slow but steady improvement in water quality and general ecological health. By 2010, measures of sea grass coverage, water clarity, and biodiversity had improved to levels last seen in the 1950s.

However, industrial and agricultural runoff along with runoff from developed areas pose a continuing threat to marine ecosystems in the bay, particularly by clouding the water with sediments and algae blooms, and seagrass coverage declined slightly in the late 2010s. Wastewater pollution from old phosphate plants near the shoreline has been a particular problem. For example, in 2004, a leak of 65 million gallons of acidic water from a Cargill phosphate plant on the bay&#x27;s southern shore severely impacted wetlands in the vicinity of the spill. 

And in April 2021, a breach of a wastewater reservoir at the long-closed Piney Point phosphate plant sent over 200 millions gallons of nutrient-rich mine tailings streaming into lower Tampa Bay. The resulting growth of red tide algae led to an ecocide and killed over 1000 tons of fish in the bay and along the nearby gulf coast and may lead to further damage to seagrass beds.

The effects of Hurricane Milton in October 2024 caused polluted waste from the fertilizer industry including products from Mosaic, which were retained after the production of phosphate, to enter into Tampa Bay. Both Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene caused disruption in the production of phosphate fertilizers from Tampa Bay.

==== Climate change ====
Tampa Bay, like other parts of Florida, is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise caused by climate change. The sea level has risen since 1946. Tampa Bay is also one of the areas in the US most at risk when hurricanes arrive because of its location, growing population, and the geography of the bay.

The Tampa Bay Regional Resiliency Coalition coordinates the region&#x27;s response to climate change. Communities throughout the Bay, including St. Petersburg and Tampa are adapting infrastructure and buildings to face changes in sea level.

==Human habitation==
===Early inhabitants===
Humans have lived in Florida for millennia, at least 14,000 years. Due to worldwide glaciation, sea levels were much lower at the time, and Florida&#x27;s peninsula extended almost 60 miles west of today&#x27;s coastline. Paleo-Indian sites have been found near rivers and lakes in northern Florida, leading to speculation that these first Floridians also lived on Tampa Bay when it was still a freshwater lake. Evidence of human habitation from this early period has been found at the Harney Flats site, which is approximately 10 miles east of the current location of Tampa&#x27;s downtown waterfront. 

The earliest evidence of human habitation directly on the shores of Tampa Bay comes from the Manasota culture, a variant of the Weeden Island culture, who lived in the area beginning around 5,000–6,000 years ago, after sea levels had risen to near modern levels and the bay was connected to the Gulf of Mexico. This culture, which relied almost exclusively on the bay for food and other resources, was in turn replaced by the similar Safety Harbor culture by approximately 800 AD. The pre-contact Indigenous nation most associated with the Tampa Bay are the historic Tocobaga nation, who are known to be among the ancestors of the contemporary Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes of Florida. 

===European exploration===
The Safety Harbor culture was dominant in the area at the time of first contact with Europeans in the mid-1500s. The Tocobaga, who built their principal town near today&#x27;s Safety Harbor in the northwest corner of Old Tampa Bay, are the most documented group from that era because they had the most interactions with Spanish explorers. However, there were many other coastal villages organized into various small chiefdoms all around the bay. 

Not finding gold or silver in the vicinity and unable to convert the native inhabitants to Christianity, the Spanish did not remain in the Tampa Bay area for long. However, diseases they introduced decimated the native population over the ensuing decades, leading to the near-total collapse of every established culture across peninsular Florida. Between this depopulation and the indifference of its colonial owners, the Tampa Bay region would be virtually uninhabited for almost 200 years.

Tampa Bay was given different names by early mapmakers. Spanish maps dated from 1584 identifies Tampa Bay as Baya de Spirito Santo (&quot;Bay of the Holy Spirit&quot;). A map dated 1695 identifies the area as Bahia Tampa. Later maps dated 1794 and 1800 show the bay divided with three different names, Tampa Bay west of the Interbay peninsula and Hillsboro Bay on the east with an overall name of Bay of Spiritu Santo. At other times, the entire bay was identified as The Bay of Tocobaga.

===United States control===
The United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1821. The name &quot;Spirito Santo&quot; seems to have disappeared from maps of the region in favor of &quot;Tampa Bay&quot; (sometimes divided into Tampa and Hillsboro Bays) soon after the US established Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River in 1824. For the next several decades, during the Seminole Wars, the Tampa Bay would be a primary point of confrontation, detention, and forced expulsion of the Seminole &amp; Miccosukee people of Florida. Fort Brooke, Fort Dade, and the American military&#x27;s miscellaneous Egmont Key facilities were the primary sites associated with the removal of the Seminole in the Floridian leg of the Trail of Tears.

For the next 100 years, many new communities were founded around the bay. Fort Brooke begat Tampa on the northeast shore, Fort Harrison (a minor military outpost on Florida&#x27;s west coast) begat Clearwater, the trading post of &quot;Braden&#x27;s Town&quot; developed into Bradenton on the south, and St. Petersburg grew quickly after its founding in the late 19th century, on the western bay shore opposite Tampa. By 2010, the Tampa Bay Area was home to over 4 million residents.

=== Transportation ===
====By sea====
As Tampa began to grow in the mid-1800s, roads across central Florida were still just rough trails and rail lines did not yet extend down the Florida peninsula, so the most convenient means of traveling to and from the area was by sea. By the late 19th century, however, the shallow nature of Tampa Bay made it impossible for large modern vessels with deeper drafts to reach the city of Tampa&#x27;s downtown wharves on Hillsboro Bay. Most ships would anchor well out from shore and transfer cargo and passengers to and from the city in smaller boats.

Henry B. Plant&#x27;s railroad line reached the area in 1884 and ran across the Interbay Peninsula to Old Tampa Bay, where he built the town and shipping facility of Port Tampa at its terminus. In 1898, Plant used his connections in the federal government to make Port Tampa a major embarkation point for the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War, leading to the U.S. Congress appropriating funds for the United States Army Corps of Engineers to begin the first large dredging operation in Tampa Bay. A deep shipping channel was created which linked Port Tampa to the mouth of the bay, enabling Plant to greatly expand his steamship line. In 1917, the Corps of Engineers dredged another channel from the mouth of Tampa Bay to the Port of Tampa, instantly making the city an important shipping center.

The Corps of Engineers currently maintains more than 80 miles of deep-water channels in Tampa Bay up to a depth of 47 feet. These must be continuously re-dredged and deepened due to the sandy nature of the bay bottom. While dredging has enabled seaborne commerce to become an important part of the Tampa Bay area&#x27;s economy, it has also damaged the bay&#x27;s water quality and ecology. More care has been taken in recent decades to lessen the environmental impact of dredging. Dredged material has also been used to create several spoil islands on the eastern side of Hillsboro Bay. These islands have become important nesting sites for many seabirds, including threatened species such as oystercatchers, and have been designated as &quot;sanctuary islands&quot; that are off-limits to boaters.

=====Ports on Tampa Bay=====
* Port Tampa Bay (known as the Port of Tampa until 2014): Oldest port on Tampa Bay, can trace its roots to the wharves of Fort Brooke in the 1820s. Currently centered east and southeast of downtown Tampa on Hillsboro and McKay Bays. Largest port in Florida; 10th largest in the nation. Port Tampa Bay accommodates half of Florida&#x27;s cargo in the form of bulk, roll-on/roll-off, refrigerated and container cargo, and petroleum products. Home to extensive ship repair and building industry and several cruise ship terminals.
* Port Tampa: Established in 1885 by Henry B. Plant at the terminus of the Plant System railroad line on the eastern shore of Old Tampa Bay. Eclipsed in tonnage and importance by the Port of Tampa in the early 1900s, but still an important arrival point for aviation fuel which is piped to nearby Tampa International Airport and MacDill Air Force Base.
* Port Manatee: Located on the southern shore of Lower Tampa Bay. Most refrigerated dockside space of any Gulf of Mexico port. Ranked fifth among Florida&#x27;s fourteen seaports in total annual cargo tonnage.
* The Port of St. Petersburg: Located on the St. Petersburg waterfront on Old Tampa Bay and operated by the city. Smallest of Florida&#x27;s ports, caters mainly to private vessels. Site of U.S. Coast Guard station.

====By land====
In the early 20th century, traveling overland between the growing communities around Tampa Bay was an arduous process. The trip between Tampa and St. Petersburg was almost around the north end of Old Tampa Bay and took up to 12 hours by train and over a full day over uncertain roads by car. The trip between St. Petersburg and Bradenton was even longer – over all the way around Tampa Bay, a trip that still took about two hours into the 1950s.

In 1924, the Gandy Bridge over Old Tampa Bay reduced the driving distance between Tampa and St. Petersburg to . Ten years later, the Davis Causeway (later renamed the Courtney Campbell Causeway) was built between Clearwater and Tampa. More bridges criss-crossed Tampa Bay over the ensuing decades, making travel between the surrounding communities much faster and furthering the economic development of the Tampa Bay area.

=====Bridges that cross Tampa Bay=====
* Sunshine Skyway Bridge: Opened 1954. Spans Lower Tampa Bay from Bradenton on the south to St. Petersburg on the north, greatly reducing travel times between Manatee and Pinellas Counties. Part of I-275 &amp; US 19.
* Gandy Bridge: Opened 1924 (first roadway bridge over Tampa Bay). Spans Old Tampa Bay from Tampa on the east to St. Petersburg on the west. Part of U.S. Route 92.
* Howard Frankland Bridge: Opened 1960. Spans middle of Old Tampa Bay from Tampa on the east to St. Pete on the west. Part of I-275.
*Courtney Campbell Causeway: Opened 1934. Spans northern Old Tampa Bay from Tampa on the east to Clearwater on the west. Part of Florida State Road 60.
* Bayside Bridge: Opened 1993. Runs roughly parallel to the western shore of Old Tampa Bay from Largo / St. Petersburg on the south to Clearwater on the north. Built to help relieve traffic congestion on nearby US-19.
* 22nd Street Causeway: Opened 1926. Bridge portion spans the mouth of McKay Bay near Port Tampa Bay. Part of U.S. Route 41.

====By air====
The difficulty of traveling between Tampa and St. Petersburg in the early 20th century inspired the world&#x27;s first scheduled air service, the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, which operated during the tourist season of 1914.

While the construction of bridges made air travel across Tampa Bay unnecessary, several airports have been built along the shoreline. Albert Whitted Airport on the St. Petersburg waterfront and Peter O. Knight Airport on Davis Island near downtown Tampa were both established in the 1930s. Later, Tampa International Airport and St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport were established on opposite sides of Old Tampa Bay, and MacDill Air Force Base opened on the southern tip of Tampa&#x27;s Interbay Peninsula.

<text>Voorhees State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is in area and is located in Lebanon Township. The park is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.

==History==
Voorhees State Park began when Foster M. Voorhees, a former governor of New Jersey, donated his farm to the people of New Jersey in 1929. Succeeding land acquisitions increased the park size to .

During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the park served as a camp for the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which planted trees and constructed shelters and trails throughout the park. The park offers views of Round Valley Reservoir and Spruce Run Reservoir. Camping is allowed in the park for a fee, depending on the type of campsite. There are 47 tent and trailer campsites. There are 2 group campsites that can accommodate up to 50 people each. There also are 3 rustic, cabin-like structures with wood stoves for heat. Each cabin can accommodate up to 4 people in 2 double-deck single bunk beds. All sites and cabins have fire rings and picnic tables. Toilets and showers are within walking distance from the all campsites and cabins. The trailer sanitary station is open April 1 through October 31. Campsites and cabins are open all year.

In 1965, the New Jersey Astronomical Association built the Paul Robinson Observatory on land leased from the state. The observatory features a Cassegrain reflecting telescope and offers public sky-watch programs.

Voorhees State Park main entrance is across the street (County Route 513) from Voorhees High School; also named after Foster M. Voorhees.

<text>Clapton Football Club is a football club in east London. One of the most successful clubs in non-League football during the first quarter of the twentieth century, they won the FA Amateur Cup five times between 1907 and 1925 and had several players selected by the England national team. In 2019 they were evicted from their long-time home, the Old Spotted Dog Ground in Forest Gate. After playing at other grounds for several seasons, they withdrew from the non-League pyramid at the end of the 2023–24 season.

==History==
Established in 1877 under the name Downs Football Club and initially based at Hackney Downs in Lower Clapton, the club originally played in dark blue shirts and white shorts, with a distinctive white Maltese cross on the left breast. The following year the club adopted its current name. Clapton began competing in the FA Cup in 1888–89, and in 1890 became the first club from Great Britain to play in continental Europe, defeating a Belgian XI 7–0 in Antwerp.

In 1894 Clapton became founder members of the Southern League, alongside Southampton, Luton Town, Millwall and Reading, and were placed in Division One. Finishing eighth in a nine-club league they were forced to play a test match to avoid relegation to Division Two, defeating Sheppey United 5–1. The following season saw them finish eighth again, but despite winning the test match against the 1st Scots Guards, the club resigned from the league as several of the other clubs turned professional.

The 1904–05 season saw Clapton reach the final of the FA Amateur Cup for the first time, losing 3–2 to West Hartlepool. The following season they became founder members of the Isthmian League, finishing as runners-up in its inaugural season. They won the FA Amateur Cup in 1906–07, defeating Stockton 2–1 in the final. In 1908–09, they won the Amateur Cup again with a 6–0 win against Eston United. The 1910–11 season saw them win their first Isthmian League title, and in 1914–15 the club won a third Amateur Cup with a 1–0 victory over Bishop Auckland in the final.

Clapton won another Isthmian League title in 1922–23. The following season saw them win their fourth Amateur Cup, defeating Erith &amp; Belvedere 3–0 in the final. They went on to retain their title as Amateur Cup holders the following season, beating Southall FC 2–1 at the Old Den. In the same season, three Clapton players were selected for the England national team. In 1925–26 the club reached the third round of the FA Cup after wins against Norwich City and Ilford in the first and second round. They were eventually knocked out, losing 3–2 at &#x27;home&#x27; to Swindon Town, a match that was played at West Ham United&#x27;s Boleyn Ground and drew a crowd of 27,000. The club would go on to reach the first round of the FA Cup again in 1926–27, 1927–28 and 1957–58, losing to Brentford, Luton Town and Queens Park Rangers respectively.

In 1975–76 Clapton finished bottom of Division One of the Isthmian League, dropping down to Division Two, which was renamed Division One in 1977. At the end of the 1981–82 season they were relegated to Division Two, but bounced back at the first time of asking as champions. The club won the Essex Senior Cup for a third time in 1984, but were relegated again at the end of the 1984–85 season, dropping into Division Two North. In 1991 the club was placed in Division Three after league reorganisation, which later became Division Two due to further reorganisation. In 2005–06 Clapton finished in bottom of the league for the second consecutive season, and subsequently joined the Essex Senior League after Division Two was disbanded. 

In 2015–16 Clapton won the Gordon Brasted Memorial Trophy, beating Stansted 4–0 in the final. After finishing second-from-bottom of the Essex Senior League in 2022–23, the club were relegated to Division One South of the Eastern Counties League. They were due to be transferred to Division One of the Southern Counties East League for the 2024–25 season, but withdrew from the league on 18 June.

==Ground==
Clapton originally played on pitches at Hackney Downs, before moving to North Millfield in Lower Clapton in 1880. The club then briefly played at Elm Farm and Pilgrims Road and then relocated to the Old Spotted Dog Ground in Forest Gate in 1887 after it was vacated by St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. The first match at the new ground was played on 29 September 1888, a 1–1 draw with Old Carthusians in front of a crowd of 700.

During the 2001–02 Isthmian League season, Clapton spent the entire season playing away from the Old Spotted Dog due to the club&#x27;s failure to undertake the Isthmian League&#x27;s required ground improvements. Clapton played the majority of their home fixtures at Aveley&#x27;s Mill Field ground, as well as groundsharing with Purfleet, Barking &amp; East Ham United, Wembley and Hertford Town. Clapton eventually returned to the Old Spotted Dog in 2003.

In the opening weeks of the 2019–20 season, Clapton, and fellow tenants Hackney Wick, were forced to vacate the Old Spotted Dog due to non-payment of rent by the leaseholders, Newham Community Leisure Trust Limited, a charity in which Clapton FC &#x27;Chief Executive&#x27; was a Trustee/Director. During Clapton&#x27;s exile, they played at Redbridge&#x27;s Oakside Stadium and Aveley&#x27;s new Parkside ground. On 17 September 2019 it was confirmed that Clapton had not been awarded a lease to remain at the Old Spotted Dog, with breakaway club Clapton Community winning the lease bid. On 12 November 2019, it was announced Clapton would groundshare with Southend Manor at Southchurch Park for the remainder of the season. In July 2020 it was confirmed that Clapton would play at the Terence McMillan Stadium in Plaistow for the forthcoming season.

==Supporters==
During Clapton&#x27;s peak in the late 19th century, the club averaged a regular home crowd of 4,000 spectators. During this period, the club were nicknamed the Doggies after their relocation to Forest Gate.

In 2012 a supporters group named the Clapton Ultras was started. The group followed the European ultras tradition and developed around local fans disengaged with modern professional football, migrants to east London and those with an opposition to discrimination and far-right politics. Following the creation of the Ultras, the club&#x27;s home attendances rose from an average of 20 in 2011–12 to 335 by the 2015–16 season. Two clubs have refused to admit Clapton fans for their matches: Southend Manor and Metropolitan Police. In July 2017, supporters won a high court injunction against Clapton chief executive Vincent McBean, who had attempted to liquidate Newham Community Leisure Limited, the charity that held the lease on the Old Spotted Dog ground.

After Clapton discontinued their reserve and youth teams, in 2016 Clapton supporters founded Downs Football Club with the club name, badge and kit all in homage to the original Downs Football Club of 1878. In 2018 some supporters formed a breakaway fan-owned club under the name of Clapton Community, joining the Middlesex County League for the 2018–19 season, playing at Wadham Lodge. After Clapton Community were promoted to the Eastern Counties League in 2023, the two clubs played each other for the first time in October 2023.

<text>:&quot;Not be confused with the Dean Burgon Society, concerned with the advocacy of the King James Bible&quot;

The Burgon Society is a society and educational charity for the study and research of academic dress. The society was founded in 2000 and is named after John William Burgon (1813–1888) from whom the &quot;Burgon shape&quot; academic hood takes its name. Its current president is Graham Zellick, CBE, QC, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of London. His predecessors were James P. S. Thomson, former Master of London Charterhouse (2011–16) and the organist John Birch.

In 2010, the society received charity status from the Charity Commission.

==Activities==
The society publishes &quot;Transactions of the Burgon Society&quot;, an annual journal of peer-reviewed research into academic dress. It holds a spring conference each year and organises visits to robemakers, universities and other institutions. 

One of the society&#x27;s founding fellows, Nicholas Groves, created the Groves classification system for academic dress, in which the most common shapes of British gowns, hoods and caps are coded for easy reference. He also designed the gowns of the University of Malta. His design, selected from entries submitted in an international competition, debuted in November 2011 at a degree ceremony in Valletta, Malta.

==Membership==
Membership is open to all who support the aims of the society. Fellowship (FBS) is awarded to members on the successful submission of a piece of original work on a topic approved by the executive committee. Fellowship may also be awarded to any member who has demonstrated in some other way a significant contribution to the study of academic dress. Occasionally, the fellowship may be awarded &quot;honoris causa&quot;.

==Patrons==
The patrons of the society are:
*The Rt Revd and Rt Hon. The Lord Chartres, GCVO, former Bishop of London
*The Rt Revd Graeme Knowles, CVO, former Dean of St Paul&#x27;s

<doc id="635956" wikidata="Q3482589" url="?curid=635956" title="Memphis Showboats">
<text>The Memphis Showboats were an American football franchise in the United States Football League. They entered the league in its expansion in 1984 and made the 1985 playoffs, losing in the semifinal round to the Oakland Invaders. Perhaps the most prominent players on the Showboats&#x27; roster during their two seasons of existence were future Pro Football Hall of Fame member Reggie White and future professional wrestler &quot;The Total Package&quot; Lex Luger.

==History==
Memphis food manufacturer Logan Young was awarded an expansion franchise for Memphis on July 17, 1983. However, soon after hiring Memphis native and former college coach Pepper Rodgers as head coach and signing a lease to play in the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, he discovered that most of his assets were tied up in a trust fund that he couldn&#x27;t access. Ultimately, he was forced to take on limited partners, then sell controlling interest to cotton magnate William Dunavant, remaining as team president.

Despite White&#x27;s play, the Showboats finished fourth in the Southern Division and missed the playoffs. Like the rest of the division, they were left far behind by the Birmingham Stallions and Tampa Bay Bandits. However, like most of the USFL&#x27;s other Southern teams, they were a runaway hit at the box office. Indeed, they were one of the few teams whose crowds actually grew as the season progressed.

The Showboats broke through in 1985, finishing fourth in the East and earning a playoff berth. They should have traveled to Denver&#x27;s Mile High Stadium to face the Denver Gold. However, the Gold were forced to travel to Memphis under pressure from ABC Sports. The Gold&#x27;s local support had all but vanished due to the USFL&#x27;s planned move to the fall, and ABC did not want the embarrassment of showing a half-empty stadium. It forced Commissioner Harry Usher to give Memphis home-field advantage in the first round, since the Showboats had been among the league&#x27;s attendance leaders once again. ABC had an outsize influence on the USFL due to the structure of the league&#x27;s television contract. The Showboats thrashed the Gold 48-7 before losing to the Oakland Invaders 28–19 in the semifinals.

The Showboats represented a serious attempt to form a viable professional football organization, and seemed to have a realistic chance to have been a viable business if the overall management of the USFL had been more realistic and financially sound. Indeed, like the World Football League&#x27;s Memphis Southmen before them, the Showboats appeared to be on more solid footing than the league as a whole. The Showboats&#x27; attendance figures made Dunavant a supporter of the USFL&#x27;s move to the fall. Although Memphis was only a medium-sized market (while Memphis proper had 650,000 people, the surrounding suburbs and rural areas are not much larger than the city itself), Dunavant believed his team&#x27;s popularity would have made it very attractive to the NFL in the event of a merger. After the USFL&#x27;s antitrust lawsuit failed, the Showboats threw their support behind Charlie Finley&#x27;s proposal to convince the Canadian Football League to expand into the U.S. market; the CFL rejected the plan, bringing the Showboats&#x27; operations to an end.

==Legacy==
Despite the eventual failure of the original USFL, the success of the Showboats franchise was noticed by the NFL, indicating a viable market in Tennessee. In 1997, the Houston Oilers franchise would move to Nashville, though they played their first season in Memphis, before moving to Nashville and being renamed the Tennessee Titans in 1999.

Dunavant emerged as an investor in the proposed Memphis Hound Dogs franchise that entered the NFL&#x27;s 1993 expansion sweepstakes (the Hound Dogs lost to the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars). Rodgers and general manager Steve Erhart would later emerge with the Memphis Mad Dogs, a Canadian Football League franchise that played one season in 1995; Erhart would also manage the Memphis Maniax of the original XFL in 2001.

The Memphis Showboats name was revived for the 2023 season of the USFL&#x27;s second iteration.

==In popular culture==

In the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; Season 2 episode &quot;Band Geeks&quot;, the band led by Squidward Tentacles plays at the &quot;Bubble Bowl&quot;, during which clips of a Showboats game (vs. the Tampa Bay Bandits at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis on May 25, 1984) are shown.

A player from the Memphis Showboats appeared as a contestant on &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; in 1985.

<text>Sacred Heart Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in Dubuque, Iowa. It is part of the Archdiocese of Dubuque and located at 2215 Windsor Ave. The parish was one of the locations where the movie &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; starring Sylvester Stallone was filmed.

The church is located in Dubuque&#x27;s north end. The church is noted for two distinctive spires that are visible for a number of miles. The spire on the eastern side of the church is over 200 feet tall and it has four large clocks installed. The spire on the western side is about 130 feet tall.

==History==

===Early history===

In 1879, Bishop John Hennessy of Dubuque realized that Saint Mary&#x27;s Church – which was the main German parish for Dubuque – would no longer be enough to serve all the German immigrants in the city as their population continued to grow. He took territory from the northern parts of Saint Mary&#x27;s parish, and established the new Sacred Heart parish in that area.

A combination church / school building was constructed on land that was purchased for that purpose. That building was just west of the present church. In the later part of the 19th century, the population of Dubuque exploded as the Milwaukee Railroad Shops came to Dubuque. A large number of young German families came to the area in search of jobs at the shops and other employers. Soon the new parish was filled to capacity.

===Modern church building===
Soon, it was decided to build a new large church. Fridolin Heer, a Dubuque architect who designed the Dubuque County Courthouse, was chosen to draw the plans for the church - which would have a capacity of 1100. Construction was begun in 1887, and was completed in 1888. Bishop Hennessy formally dedicated the church on Palm Sunday, 1888. The old church building was converted into classroom space.

===Expansion===
However, the population in the north end continued to grow. Soon the new church was filled to capacity. Within a few years, Bishop Hennessy had to take territory from the western parts of the parish to form Holy Ghost parish. However, the population of the parish continued to grow. So more territory was taken from the northeastern parts of the parish to form Holy Trinity parish. Over time the creation of new parishes, along with movement of families out to the west helped to stabilize the parish.

===Organ===

The church has had two pipe organs over the years. Soon after the completion of the church in the 1890s, an organ was installed in the church. This initial organ was installed by William Schuelke of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. With the availability of electricity, in 1922 a new large Wangerin-Werchardt pipe organ was installed in the church. This organ uses a number of pipes and other parts from the 1890s organ, and is 41 ranks in size. In the 1980s the organ was renovated, and today is widely recognized as one of the finest in the area.

===School===

For many years, Sacred Heart had the distinction of having a lay man as principal, and this man would also serve as organist. Because of a lack of religious, at times lay men or women would serve as teachers. Eventually as more religious arrived, they took over administration and teaching of students. In the years following World War II, the parish school had the largest student population in the midwest. However, over time the school population declined as more families moved to the western parts of the city. This was because of a small group of administrators whose main objective was to push out the lower income families in the north end. 

The school was joined with the Holy Trinity parish school for a number of years. In recent years, all the parish schools in the city have become part of the Holy Family School System and many of the schools are now closed.

===Art===
Early photos of the church show two additional stained glass windows in the sanctuary behind the main altar. However, these windows were eventually covered over. In the mid-20th century, a number of new windows were installed in the church. On the eastern side, part of the windows have images from the history of the church in Dubuque – such as the arrival of Bishop Loras at Dubuque, and the building of the first cathedral. On the western side, images of a number of important historical events worldwide are displayed - such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

The church ceiling features paintings by Clotilde Elizabeth Brielmaier.

===Renovations===
The church originally had three large altars. People would often travel some distance to see these distinctive altars. In a controversial move, those altars were taken down in the years following the Second Vatican Council and replaced with a simplified altar.

In the 1990s, a new handicap accessible entrance was built on the western side of the church, which included an elevator. Previously handicapped parishioners were encouraged to park on the east side of the church, where a street-level entrance was available.

In 2000, the inside of the church was completely refurbished. The old confessionals were moved to the sanctuary to create a small Eucharistic chapel. A new altar was installed, and some pews were removed from the back of the church so a larger gathering space could be created inside the church. The walls were painted a light blue color, and some fresco highlights from the original design were painted along the walls and ceiling. The basement was also completely refurbished during this time.

===F.I.S.T.===

The movie &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot;, starring Sylvester Stallone, was filmed largely in Dubuque. The main reason was that, with its absence of TV antennas, Dubuque looked more like Cleveland of the 1930s than Cleveland did. There aren&#x27;t many antennas because Dubuque had developed a cable system early on. This, in turn, was because the city&#x27;s geography made over-the-air reception problematic. The church basement was one of the many Dubuque locations where filming was done, as was the sacristy of the church. The main entrance to the church can be seen in the wedding scenes that were filmed at the church.

Sacred Heart Church also appeared briefly on the ABC news program &quot;20/20&quot;. This was after a cross burning was done by a gang of young racists in the city to intimidate African-American people living in Dubuque. The segment explored race relations in Dubuque. The exterior of the church was shown while the &quot;20/20&quot; reporter gave viewers a background on the city.

<doc id="635962" wikidata="Q455948" url="?curid=635962" title="Rudolf Slánský">
<text>Rudolf Slánský (31 July 1901 – 3 December 1952) was a leading Czech Communist politician. Holding the post of the party&#x27;s General Secretary after World War II, he was one of the leading creators and organizers of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.

After the split between Josip Broz Tito and Joseph Stalin, the latter instigated a wave of &quot;purges&quot; of the respective Communist Party leaderships, to prevent more splits between the Soviet Union and its Central European &quot;satellite&quot; countries. In Czechoslovakia, Slánský was one of 14 leaders arrested in 1951, tortured into confessing their &quot;crimes&quot;, and put on show trial &quot;en masse&quot; in November 1952, charged with high treason. After eight days, 11 of the 14 were convicted and sentenced to death. Slánský was executed five days later.

==Early life==
Born at Nezvěstice, now in Plzeň-City District. Slánský&#x27;s family was Jewish and conservative. He attended secondary school in Plzeň at the Commercial Academy.

After the end of World War I, he went to Prague, the capital, where he discovered a leftist intellectual scene in institutions such as the Marxist Club. In 1921, Slánský joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia when it broke away from the Social Democratic Party. He rose within the party and became a senior lieutenant of its leader, Klement Gottwald. At the Fifth Party Congress in 1929, Slánský was named a member of the party Presidium and the Politburo, and Gottwald became General Secretary.

From 1929 to 1935, Slánský lived in hiding due to the illegal status of the Communist Party. In 1935, after the party was allowed to participate in politics, both he and Gottwald were elected to the National Assembly. Their gains were halted, however, when Czechoslovakia was carved up at the Munich Conference in 1938. After Nazi Germany occupied the Sudetenland in October 1938, Slánský, along with much of the rest of the Czechoslovak communist leadership, fled to the Soviet Union.

In Moscow, Slánský worked on broadcasts to Czechoslovakia over Radio Moscow. He lived through the defense of Moscow against the Germans during the winter of 1941–42. His experience in Moscow brought him into contact with Soviet Communists and the often brutal methods they favored for maintaining party discipline.

In 1943 in Moscow, Slánský&#x27;s infant daughter, Naďa (Nadia), was forcibly abducted from her baby carriage by a woman. The infant was in the company of her eight-year-old brother, Rudolf, who put up resistance. The woman revealed details about their mother, Mrs. Slánská, including her job with Radio Moscow. Neither Nadia nor the perpetrators were ever found. In her 1969 memoir, Josefa Slánská, Slánský&#x27;s widow, recounted that written inquiries were made to the police and to Stalin himself, all of which went unanswered.

While in exile in the Soviet Union, Slánský also organized Czechoslovak army units. He returned with them to Czechoslovakia in 1944 to participate in the Slovak National Uprising.

==Power in the postwar period==
In 1945, after World War II, Slánský and other Czechoslovak leaders returned from exile in London and Moscow, holding meetings to organize the new National Front government under Edvard Beneš. At the 8th Party Congress of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party in March 1946, Slánský was chosen as General Secretary of the Communist Party. He was the number two man in the party behind party chairman Gottwald, who became leader of a coalition government after elections held that year.

In 1948, after the Communist Party seized power in the February coup, Slánský became the second most powerful man in the country after Gottwald. At that point Slánský was blamed for economic and industrial troubles, costing him popular support. But he was also awarded the Order of Socialism, a top decoration, on 30 July 1951. Publication was planned for a book of his speeches in support of socialism, to be titled &quot;Towards the Victory of Socialism&quot;.

==Trial==

In 1951, after Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia broke with him, Stalin decided to &quot;purge&quot; the Communist parties of the satellite countries of the Soviet Union in order to deter any further revolts against his rule. Most historians think that, fearing arrest and death, President Gottwald of Czechoslovakia decided to sacrifice his best friend, Rudolf Slánský, in order to save himself. On November 24, 1951, at 1 a.m. Slánský was arrested and imprisoned. During the following year he was tortured into confessing his &quot;crimes&quot;. Bedřich Geminder and Jarmila Taussigová were also arrested the same day. Official USSR rhetoric had turned against Zionism. Stalin was intent on keeping power in the Eastern bloc countries.

Party rhetoric asserted that Slánský was spying as part of an international western capitalist conspiracy to undermine socialism and that punishing him would avenge the Nazi murders of Czech communists Jan Šverma and Julius Fučík during World War II.

Some historians say that Stalin desired complete obedience from leaders of the so-called &quot;People&#x27;s Democracies&quot; (that is, Eastern bloc countries), as well as at home. He threatened to conduct &quot;purges&quot; of the &quot;nationalistic communists&quot;.

Other historians, though, say that the rivalry between Slánský and Gottwald escalated after the 1948 coup. Slánský began consolidating his power within the party secretariat and placing more of his party supporters in governmental positions, encroaching on Gottwald&#x27;s position as president after the resignation of Beneš. Stalin backed Gottwald because he was believed to have a better chance of building up the Czechoslovak economy into a position where it could start producing useful goods for the Soviet Union.

Slánský was thought to be weakened by his image as a &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; figure. Gottwald and his ally Antonín Zápotocký, both populists, tarred Slánský with charges of belonging to the bourgeoisie. Slánský and his allies were also opposed by old-time party members, the government, and the party&#x27;s Political Bureau. In prison after his arrest, Slánský was tortured and he attempted suicide.

The trial of the 14 national leaders began on 20 November 1952, in the Senate of the State Court, with the prosecutor being Josef Urválek. It lasted eight days. As in the Moscow show trials of the late 1930s, the defendants admitted guilt in court and requested a death sentence. Slánský was found guilty of &quot;Trotskyite-Titoist-Zionist activities in the service of American imperialism.&quot; He was publicly hanged at Pankrác Prison on 3 December 1952. His body was cremated, and the ashes were scattered on an icy road outside of Prague.

==Posthumously==

Reflecting changes in Czechoslovakia, in April 1963 Slánský and other victims of the purge trials were cleared under the penal code. They were fully rehabilitated and exonerated in May 1968. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the new president Václav Havel, appointed Slánský&#x27;s son, also named Rudolf, as the Czech ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Slánský was the most powerful politician to be executed during the rule of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia and under the influence of Stalinism. Afterwards the treatment of leaders who had fallen out of favour with the government was more moderate; they were stripped of power and ordered to retire.

<doc id="635972" wikidata="Q667999" url="?curid=635972" title="Nightstand">
<text>A nightstand, alternatively night table, bedside table, daystand or bedside cabinet, is a small table or cabinet designed to stand beside a bed or elsewhere in a bedroom. Modern nightstands are usually small bedside tables, often with one or sometimes more drawers and/or shelves and less commonly with a small door. They are often used to support items that might be useful during the night, such as a table lamp, reading matter, cell phone, eyeglasses, tissues, a drink, or medication.

Before indoor flush toilets became commonplace, the main function of a nightstand was to contain a chamber pot. As a result, early nightstands were often small cabinets, sometimes fitted with a drawer, and usually containing an enclosed storage space below covered by one or more doors. Another term sometimes given to such cabinets was commode.

French, Italian and Spanish antique nightstands usually have one drawer and an enclosed storage space with one door. They can be embellished with gold leaf finish, bronze or parquetry inlaid.

Wood and pressboard are the most common materials used for nightstands.

<doc id="635973" wikidata="Q1359925" url="?curid=635973" title="Ring of Gyges">
<text>The Ring of Gyges (, &quot;Gúgou Daktúlios&quot;, ) is a hypothetical magic ring mentioned by the philosopher Plato in Book 2 of his &quot;Republic&quot; (2:359a–2:360d). It grants its owner the power to become invisible at will. Using the ring as an example, this section of the &quot;Republic&quot; considers whether a rational, intelligent person who has no need to fear negative consequences for committing an injustice would nevertheless act justly.

==The legends==
Gyges of Lydia was a historical king, the founder of the Mermnad dynasty of Lydian kings. Various ancient works—the most well-known being &quot;The Histories&quot; of Herodotus—gave different accounts of the circumstances of his acquisition of power. All, however, agree in asserting that he was originally a subordinate of King Candaules of Lydia, that he killed Candaules and seized the throne, and that he had either seduced Candaules&#x27; Queen before killing him, married her afterwards, or both.

In the recounting of the myth by Glaucon (Plato&#x27;s older brother, as a character of the &quot;Republic&quot;), an unnamed ancestor of Gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia. After an earthquake, a chasm was revealed in a mountainside where he was feeding his flock. Entering the chasm, he discovered that it was in fact a tomb with a bronze horse containing a corpse, larger than that of a man, who wore a golden ring, which he then pocketed. He discovered that by adjusting the ring, he gained the power of invisibility. He then arranged to become one of the king&#x27;s messengers as to the status of the flocks. Arriving at the palace, he used his new power of invisibility to seduce the queen, and with her help, murder the king, and become king of Lydia himself.

==The role of the legend in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;==
In the &quot;Republic&quot;, the tale of the ring of Gyges is described by the character of Glaucon, the brother of Plato. Glaucon asks whether any man could be so virtuous that he may resist the temptation of killing, robbing, raping, or generally doing injustice to whomever he pleased if he could do so remaining undetected. Glaucon wants Socrates to argue that it is beneficial for us to be just, independent of any consideration for our reputation.

Glaucon posits:

Though his answer to Glaucon&#x27;s challenge is delayed, Socrates argues ultimately that justice does not derive from this social construct: the man who abused the power of the Ring of Gyges has in fact enslaved himself to his appetites, while the man who chose not to use it remains rationally in control of himself and is therefore happy (Republic 10:612b).

==Cultural influences==
* Cicero retells the story of Gyges in &quot;De Officiis&quot; to illustrate his thesis that a wise or good individual bases decisions on a fear of moral degradation as opposed to punishment or negative consequences. Cicero follows with a discussion of the role of thought experiments in philosophy. The hypothetical situation in question is complete immunity from punishment of the kind afforded to Gyges by his ring.
*J.R.R. Tolkien was familiar with Plato&#x27;s myth and had possibly read part of the story&#x27;s original text in Ancient Greek; the fable influenced his writing of his literary masterpiece &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<doc id="635979" wikidata="Q542489" url="?curid=635979" title="Omarosa Manigault Newman">
<text>Omarosa Onee Newman (; Manigault; born February 5, 1974), known mononymously as Omarosa, is an American reality television show participant, writer, and former political aide. She has worked in the White House offices of former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. She became widely known as a contestant on the first season of NBC&#x27;s reality television series &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

Newman became assistant to the President and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison during the Trump administration in January 2017. However, on December 13, 2017, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly fired Newman, citing &quot;money and integrity issues&quot;, as well as &quot;inappropriate use of company vehicles&quot;. Afterwards, she competed twice on the &quot;Big Brother&quot; reality seriesin 2018 on the first season of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother US&quot;, placing 5th, and in 2021 on &quot;Big Brother Australia VIP&quot;, placing 12th.

In August 2018, Newman published &quot;Unhinged&quot;, detailing her tenure at the White House and criticizing Trump and his administration. Two days before the book was released, she released the first of as many as 200 secret tapes she recorded during her White House tenure. As of May 23, 2022, she had released four tapes. The first tape released, which was secretly recorded inside the Situation Room, was described as &quot;one of the worst White House security breaches ever,&quot; though the tape is thought not to violate the Espionage Act.

On March 15, 2020, Newman was forced to pay $61,585 to the US Treasury for her violation of the Ethics in Government Act, in what the judge described as &quot;willful violation&quot; after receiving &quot;countless reminders&quot; to submit her final financial disclosure after being fired from her position in the White House.

==Early life and career==
Newman was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the daughter of Theresa Marie Walker and Jack Thomas Manigault. Newman&#x27;s father was murdered when she was seven years old. After graduating from The Rayen School in Youngstown, she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications with a concentration in radio in 1996 at Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio. She later moved to Washington, D.C., to attend Howard University, where she earned a master&#x27;s degree and worked toward a doctorate in communications, but did not finish. She temporarily served as a facilitator and presenter at Howard University. Newman has also received biblical studies training at Payne Theological Seminary in Wilberforce, Ohio.

In the 1990s, Newman worked in the office of Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton administration. She later said the job had been &quot;a very difficult environment, because they don&#x27;t believe in training. They just kind of throw you in the fire.&quot; Gore&#x27;s former office administrator, Mary Margaret Overbey, said in 2017 that Newman &quot;was the worst hire we ever made.&quot; In her resume, Newman later described her job duties as a &quot;senior scheduling and advance coordinator&quot; in charge of Gore&#x27;s schedule, though former Gore staffers told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she was only in charge of responding to invitations. She was later transferred to Clinton&#x27;s Commerce Department via the White House personnel office. Cheryl Shavers, who then served as the Commerce Department&#x27;s Undersecretary for Technology Administration, said that Newman was &quot;unqualified and disruptive,&quot; adding, &quot;I had her removed.&quot;

==Reality television career==
===First and seventh seasons of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Merger&quot;===
Newman first came to public attention in 2004 after becoming a participant on the first season of NBC&#x27;s reality television series &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. Stemming from her confrontational persona on &quot;The Apprentice&quot; (particularly in its boardroom segments), Newman soon became the &quot;woman America loved to hate&quot; and was named by E! as &quot;reality TV&#x27;s number one bad girl&quot;. Newman has disagreed with the &quot;villain&quot; label, rather believing herself to be &quot;a shrewd businesswoman,&quot; asserting that when a man behaves assertively, he is seen as strong, but when a woman does so, she is portrayed negatively. Newman has also claimed the show&#x27;s producers manipulated footage of her to make her look like the villain. She was &quot;fired&quot; in week 9.

In January 2008, Newman participated in the first season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; sequel show, &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;; she became the only former &quot;Apprentice&quot; participant to be invited back to the series. On &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, she quickly became embroiled in a personal feud with fellow contestant Piers Morgan. She was eventually fired in the 10th episode, after serving as the project manager of the team that, according to Trump, suffered &quot;the biggest slaughter in the history of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;&quot; in a challenge to sell artwork against a team led by Morgan. She raised $49,000 in total for her charity.

In June 2010, Newman and Trump collaborated to create a dating show called &quot;The Ultimate Merger&quot;, with 12 men competing for her affections. The show aired on TV One.

===Thirteenth season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;===

In February 2013, Newman returned to television and &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, appearing on Trump&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. She quickly marshalled her team to an early victory on the show, winning a task involving the creation of a photo booth at Universal Orlando. In a later episode, Lil Jon&#x27;s team was brought back to the boardroom after they lost. Piers Morgan remarked, &quot;my argument against you has always been that you&#x27;re not a celebrity... and you don&#x27;t have star power,&quot; which led to a heated argument that resulted in Trump firing Newman. On &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, when asked by Jimmy Fallon whether or not she felt the show set her up by having Piers Morgan act as one of the judges, Newman answered, &quot;I felt like I was competing against Piers, as well as the other contestants.&quot; Newman also noted that when she sees Morgan&#x27;s show canceled in a year, it will be &quot;the best revenge&quot;.
Omarosa filed a lawsuit against Latoya Jackson following the finale of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; 2013.

===Controversy===

On &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 2004, Newman accused fellow &quot;Apprentice&quot; participant Ereka Vetrini of calling her the &quot;&quot;, a claim Vetrini has denied. Shortly after that appearance, Newman didn&#x27;t attend a scheduled appearance on the &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; show after she reportedly objected upon seeing a polygraph machine.

Following her stint on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice: All Stars&quot;, Newman lashed out at La Toya Jackson over Jackson&#x27;s remarks that insinuated that Newman had murdered her fiancé, Michael Clarke Duncan. Jackson made the remarks in &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; confessionals and in following media interviews.

When asked about the probability of suing La Toya Jackson, Newman said:

===&quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;===
Newman appeared on the first season of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, a spin-off of the &quot;Big Brother&quot; series. The show aired on the CBS network, February 7 to 25, 2018. Newman remained in the game throughout that time, surviving elimination and winning multiple competitions right up until the finale, where she was one of the last five contestants standing. At one point, host Julie Chen speculated that Newman could win the entire season. Throughout the season, she expressed her objections to working with Donald Trump and his administration as well as claims about her White House experience. Many of these political revelations garnered significant media attention and headline news. Newman placed fifth being evicted in a 2–0 house vote.

===&quot;Big Brother VIP&quot;===
In 2021, Newman competed on &quot;Big Brother VIP&quot;, the celebrity edition of Australian &quot;Big Brother&quot;. Newman was nominated for the first eviction by Caitlyn Jenner, and subsequently evicted in a 5–3–2 house vote.

==Trump presidential campaign and administration==
In a 2015 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, Omarosa identified as a &quot;die-hard&quot; Hillary supporter. She has been a registered Democrat for over a decade. However her personal relationship with the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump prevailed and during the Republican National Convention in July 2016, it was announced she had been named director of African-American outreach for Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign. In September 2016, she said in an interview with &quot;Frontline&quot;: &quot;Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump. It&#x27;s everyone who&#x27;s ever doubted Donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him. It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.&quot; Shortly after Trump won the election, Newman stated that Trump has an &quot;enemies&quot; list of Republicans who voted against him.

In December 2016, Newman was announced as one of nine additional members to Trump&#x27;s presidential transition team. Unlike the rest of President Trump&#x27;s inner circle appointments, Omarosa didn&#x27;t have any roots in the Republican party or otherwise conservative or right wing activism. In December 2016, she accompanied former NFL stars Ray Lewis and Jim Brown to meet with Trump at Trump Tower.

On January 3, 2017, it was reported that Newman would join Trump&#x27;s White House staff, focusing on public engagement. Her specific title was made public the next day as assistant to the President and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison. In her first interview after being named to the Trump White House, Newman told Megyn Kelly that she was a &quot;Trumplican&quot; and had switched her political affiliation to the Republican Party. Newman said she hoped more African Americans would follow her lead and do the same, and accused Democrats of taking African-American voters for granted and making empty promises to them.

In June 2017, Newman invited the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to visit the White House, signing the invitation as &quot;the Honorable Omarosa Manigault&quot;. Some members of the CBC took exception to her use of the title, which is neither customary for political aides nor typically self-applied. The CBC ultimately declined the invitation. In August 2017, Newman was on a panel about losing loved ones to violence at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in New Orleans, Louisiana. She became involved in a shouting match with moderator and fellow panelist Ed Gordon because his questions to her focused on Trump&#x27;s policies and not her personal history with losing family members to violence.

===Departure===
On December 13, 2017, the White House announced Newman&#x27;s resignation, effective January 20, 2018. The United States Secret Service stated the agency was not involved in the termination process or escorting/removing Newman from the complex. The Secret Service&#x27;s only involvement in the matter was to deactivate her access pass. CNN White House correspondent April Ryan reported that White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly fired Newman, but she disputed the account, stating that she resigned. But Newman had secretly taped her firing, and gave the tape to Chuck Todd to play on his NBC program &quot;Meet The Press&quot; on August 12, 2018. This tape caused some controversy, as Newman had brought a recording device into the highly secret White House Situation Room, which was used for several important events in American history like the raid on Osama bin Laden&#x27;s compound.

In February 2018, Newman publicly criticized the Trump administration on the reality television program &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, and stated that she would not vote for Trump again.

===After the Trump administration===

Newman wrote a book deeply critical of Trump titled &quot;Unhinged&quot;, which went on sale on August 14, 2018, in which she labels Trump a racist, and states that witnesses have confirmed the existence of tapes of Trump repeatedly using the word &quot;nigger&quot; during the filming of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. During an interview, fellow contestant Penn Jillette appeared to confirm this, saying, &quot;Yeah, I was in the room&quot; when asked, though without elaborating on what Trump said, and later stood by his comment, saying &quot;I was careful&quot; and &quot;I’ve been told it’s clear&quot;. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the book is &quot;riddled with lies and false accusations&quot; and accused Newman of &quot;trying to profit off these false attacks.&quot; When questioned about whether she could say with certainty Trump had never said the &quot;n-word&quot;, Sanders said she &quot;can&#x27;t guarantee anything&quot;. Some journalists deemed Newman an unreliable narrator. Newman said that she had turned down an offer of a $15,000 per month &quot;senior position&quot; in the Trump 2020 re-election campaign from Lara Trump, President Trump&#x27;s daughter-in-law, which came with a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that was as &quot;harsh and restrictive&quot; as any she had seen in her television career. The president sought to enforce the NDA in an August 2018 filing with the American Arbitration Association, which was rejected in September 2021, directing the Trump campaign to pay Newman&#x27;s legal fees. After the parties disputed the amount of the settlement, the arbitrator set it to $1.3 million in April 2022.

In May 2019, Manigault Newman joined a collective legal action against the Trump campaign organization for allegedly violating the Equal Pay Act. The legal action was instigated earlier that year, when the former Trump campaign staffer Alva Johnson filed a lawsuit against the president in federal court and accused him of sexual assault during the 2016 presidential campaign. Johnson had additionally claimed that &quot;women of color were paid less than white men&quot; with similar or less professional responsibilities on the campaign trail.

== Personal life ==
Newman had an older brother, Jack Thomas Manigault Jr., who was murdered in 2011.

In 2000, Newman married Aaron Stallworth and changed her last name to Manigault-Stallworth. They separated, and later divorced, in 2005. She reverted to her maiden name, and eventually started using her first name mononymously.

In August 2009, Newman enrolled at the United Theological Seminary in Ohio to pursue a Doctor of Ministry degree. She received a preacher&#x27;s license in February 2011 from her church (Weller Street Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, California) and was formally ordained on February 27, 2012. In February 2012, Newman was working on finishing her degree at Payne Theological Seminary. She said on &quot;&quot; that she is an ordained Baptist minister. In the segment, Newman said that she was brought to the decision after traveling to West Africa, where she found herself alone in an orphanage with a little girl dying of AIDS.

Newman said, of her interaction with the little girl:

On August 13, 2010, Newman confirmed that she was dating actor Michael Clarke Duncan, whom she had met in the produce section of a Whole Foods supermarket. In July 2012, she found Duncan in cardiac arrest and performed CPR. Though Newman was able to resuscitate him, he never fully recovered from the heart attack and died on September 3, 2012, after two months in the hospital. Seven months after his death and according to Duncan&#x27;s family and friends, Newman was under suspicion of changing his will and testament. Duncan&#x27;s family and friends also claimed that she lied about her engagement, and sold Duncan&#x27;s belongings without the family&#x27;s knowledge.

She married John Allen Newman on April 8, 2017, at Trump&#x27;s Washington, D.C., hotel in the Presidential Ballroom of the Old Post Office Pavilion. After the wedding, Newman took her bridal party to do a photo shoot in the White House, but she was unable to post her photos because of concerns over ethics and security. John Newman is the senior pastor of The Sanctuary at Mt. Calvary, a church in Jacksonville, Florida.

Omarosa is currently attending Southern University Law Center and competed at the 2022 and 2023 Case Classic Mock Trial Competition against Hannah Sylvester and Spencer Conley. In 2023, she also competed at Bloomberg Law Presents: The Crimson Cup.

<text>Kwame is an Akan masculine given name among the Akan people (such as the Akuapem, Ashanti, Akyem, Bono and Fante) in Ghana which is given to a boy born on Saturday. Traditionally in Ghana, a child would receive their Akan day name during their Outdooring, eight days after birth.

<text>Mount Ngauruhoe () is a volcanic cone in New Zealand. It is the youngest vent in the Tongariro stratovolcano complex on the Central Plateau of the North Island and first erupted about 2,500 years ago. Although often regarded as a separate mountain, geologically, it is a secondary cone of Mount Tongariro.

The volcano lies between the active volcanoes of Mount Tongariro to the north and Mount Ruapehu to the south, to the west of the Rangipo Desert and to the south of the southern shore of Lake Taupō.

== Etymology ==
Before the initial mapping of the area introduced labelling confusion, the local Māori name for the cone was Tongariro, and its summit crater was known as Ngāuruhoe. 

The local Māori traditions state that the volcano was named by Ngātoro-i-rangi, an ancestor of the local Māori iwi, Ngāti Tūwharetoa. Ngātoro-i-rangi called volcanic fire from his homeland Hawaiki, which eventually emerged at Ngauruhoe.
The name given by Ngātoro-i-rangi (&quot;Ngāuruhoe&quot;) either commemorates his slave, who had died from the cold before the fire arrived, or refers to the insertions (&quot;ngā uru&quot;) of Ngātoro-i-rangi&#x27;s &quot;hoe&quot; (paddle-like staff) into the ground during his summoning of the volcanic fire.
Complicating the 

== Geology ==

In this region of the southern Taupō Rift, the Tertiary greywacke basement is tens to hundreds of metres thick and hundreds of metres above sea level. The magma reservoir is about deep although other historic Tongariro vents to the south had much deeper magma sources.

== Recent activity ==

Ngauruhoe was New Zealand&#x27;s most active volcano in the 20th century with 45 eruptions, the most recent in 1977. Fumaroles exist inside the inner crater and on the rim of the eastern, outer crater. Climbers who suffer from asthma may be affected by the strong sulphurous gases emitted from the crater.
A significant increase in earthquake activity in May 2006 prompted the alert level to be raised from zero (typical background activity, no signs of significant unrest) to one (signs of volcano unrest). Over the next two years GeoNet recorded an average of 5 to 30 earthquakes a day close to Ngauruhoe, though the maximum daily number was as high as 80.

After mid-2008, the number of volcanic earthquakes close to Ngauruhoe declined to the background level. Regular measurements of volcanic gas levels and the temperature of a summit gas vent failed to record any significant changes over the subsequent two and a half years.
GNS Science accordingly reduced the alert level for Ngauruhoe to Level 0 on 2 December 2008. “The reduction in earthquake activity means that an eruption in the near future is unlikely without further earthquakes or other changes and the appropriate alert level is therefore zero”, said GNS Science Volcano Section Manager Gill Jolly.

An increase in seismic activity in March 2015 resulted in the alert level being raised to Level 1. The anomalous activity was deemed to have subsided after three weeks, and the alert level was lowered back to Level 0.

Despite these potential indicators, some geologists speculate that activity may have permanently shifted away from the mountain, as the current dormancy is by far the longest in the volcano&#x27;s relatively short history, and recent eruptions from the parent Tongariro volcanic complex have all been further north.

== Climbing ==

The mountain is usually climbed from the western side, from the Mangatepopo track. In summer the climb is difficult due to the loose tephra that gives way underfoot. In the summer of 2010 a climber was seriously injured by falling rock. In winter, snow consolidates the tephra. After rain, the snow may be covered by ice which is treacherous. Ice axes, crampons and ropes are recommended in midwinter. Between March and October the mountain is subject to sudden violent wind gusts and snow storms with the temperature dropping well below freezing.
There is also a route from the northern side which cuts across the lava flows in the Mangatepopo valley from the Mangatepopo hut. This route is far longer with no flat areas. On reaching the summit, climbers can circumnavigate the crater and descend the normal eastern route.

During the closure of the central part of the Mt. Tongariro one day walk, due to volcanic activity, climbing Mt. Ngauruhoe became a popular alternative. At Easter 2013 four climbers were injured in separate incidents. Two of the accidents were due to congestion on the normal eastern route to the crater when a climber caused loose rock to hit another climber below. All the injured had to be rescued by helicopter.

The Department of Conservation has asked trampers not to climb the mountain, out of respect for its tapu (sacred) nature.

== Film appearances ==
In 1974, as part of a promotional campaign for his sponsor Moët &amp; Chandon, champion skier Jean-Claude Killy was filmed skiing down the previously unskied eastern slope of the mountain. The average slope on this side of the volcano is 35 degrees, and Killy was caught on radar skiing more than . As he fell on the first run, he did the descent twice. He used helicopters to access the mountain top when the last eruption had been the day before and an eruption occurred at the end of his final run.

Mount Ngauruhoe was used as a stand-in for the fictional Mount Doom in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, achieving worldwide exposure.

== Climbing history ==
The first recorded ascent by a European was by John Bidwill in March 1839, the ascent being from the north-west. He reported that “The crater was the most terrific abyss I ever looked into or imagined … it was not possible to see above 10 yards into it from the quantity of steam which it was continually discharging”.

<text>F.I.S.T. (stylized on-screen as F•I•S•T) is a 1978 American action crime drama film produced and directed by Norman Jewison and starring Sylvester Stallone. Stallone plays a Cleveland warehouse worker who becomes involved in the labor union leadership of the fictional &quot;Federation of Inter-State Truckers&quot; (F.I.S.T.). The film is loosely based on the Teamsters Union and their former President Jimmy Hoffa. The screenplay was by Joe Eszterhas and Stallone, from a story by Eszterhas.

==Plot==
At a loading dock in Cleveland in 1937, supervisor Mr. Gant hires a new worker, Polish American Lincoln Dombrowsky. Gant tells Dombrowsky that he will only be paid for his regular shift even if he must work overtime, and that any merchandise he damages will come directly out of his pay. When Dombrowsky drops a few carts of tomatoes, his pay is docked and another worker is fired for helping him collect the fallen merchandise. Resentful of these unfair labor practices, Hungarian-American worker Johnny Kovak leads a riot. The laborers go to the office of Boss Andrews, where Kovak believes he negotiates a deal for the workers, only to find out the next day that he and his friend Abe Belkin have been fired.

Kovak and Belkin are approached by Mike Monahan, who was impressed by their leadership. He offers them positions in the Federation of Inter State Truckers (F.I.S.T.), where they will be paid according to how many members they can recruit. Kovak is given a car to use while recruiting, which also allows him to meet and soon start dating Lithuanian-American worker Anna Zarinkas. Kovak is successfully recruiting new F.I.S.T. members, which attracts attention from business owners. When Kovak turns down their offer to recruit new workers to their non-union trucking firms, the shady owners have him physically attacked. Kovak rises into a leadership role through his union recruiting, causing competition with hothead F.I.S.T. leader Max Graham.

Soon Monahan, Kovak and Belkin begin working to get the F.I.S.T. members at Consolidated Trucking covered by a labor agreement. When management refuses to deal with them, the F.I.S.T. workers strike. They set up camp outside Consolidated Trucking&#x27;s gates, but are pushed out by strikebreakers and hired security. Monahan tries to ram the gates in a truck, but is shot and killed. At his funeral, Kovak decides to &quot;get some muscle&quot; and accepts help from Vince Doyle, a local gangster. Doyle&#x27;s men attack trucks trying to make deliveries. Local mobsters and the members of F.I.S.T. join forces to storm the gates of Consolidated Trucking. The president of Consolidated Trucking finally signs a labor agreement.

Building on this success, Kovak and Belkin travel the Midwest to recruit more workers. Kovak becomes wealthier and marries Anna. A new crime figure, Babe Milano, comes on the scene and wants a piece of the action. Kovak meets Milano with Doyle and, although reluctant to involve him in his business, decides it will be best for now.

By 1958, (by the song “Rockin&#x27; Robin”) F.I.S.T. has become a large and important union, with about two million members. When Kovak visits Max Graham at F.I.S.T. headquarters, he is displeased to see how luxurious the building and Graham&#x27;s offices are. Kovak visits with Belkin, now leading F.I.S.T. business on the West Coast, who explains that Graham has made money unethically off the union. In his investigation, Kovak finds that Graham used his influence to steer union businesses and funds to shell companies owned by him or his wife, and has used violence against the wife of a trucking company owner who resisted the union.

Graham is a strong favorite to be elected F.I.S.T. president. Belkin suggests to Kovak that they turn Graham in to the authorities, but Kovak is too worried about the damage to the union from the scandal. Kovak confronts Graham with what he knows, convincing him to support Kovak&#x27;s run for union president.

Now the newly elected president of F.I.S.T., Kovak is investigated by Senator Madison, who suspects Kovak of ties with the Mafia through his work with gangsters Doyle and Milano. Belkin urges Kovak to cut off Milano and make the union &quot;clean again&quot;, but Kovak ignores his request. When Doyle later tells Kovak that Belkin plans to testify against them, Kovak insists that Belkin not be harmed.

Subpoenaed to testify before Senator Madison&#x27;s committee, Kovak is told that Belkin has been killed and the senator believes Kovak is responsible. Shocked, Kovak has an emotional outburst and storms out of the hearing. He returns home to find Anna and the children are missing. He gets his pistol but is shot and presumably killed by Milano&#x27;s men. The movie ends with a shot of a bumper sticker on a truck which reads, &quot;Where&#x27;s Johnny?&quot;

==Cast==
Anthony Kiedis, who became the founding lead singer of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers five years later, appeared in a small role using his stage name Cole Dammett, a tribute to the stage name Blackie Dammett used by his actor father.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
United Artists hired Joe Eszterhas to write a screenplay about the labor movement in 1974 after executive producer Gene Corman read his articles on the subject in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Eszterhas, who had never written a screenplay before, wrote a 40-page-essay on the history of labor unions in the American Midwest. Arthur B. Krim hired Norman Jewison in the position of producer-director and offered him a $4 million budget if Jewison could match it with another $4 million. He eventually failed to find another studio to co-finance the film and received a full $8.1 million budget regardless. Eszterhas originally envisioned the role of Kovak with Jack Nicholson (who would later play Jimmy Hoffa, on whom Kovak was loosely based), but Sylvester Stallone was cast instead. Sylvester Stallone rewrote Joe Eszterhas&#x27; script, saying: &quot;Joe Eszterhas wrote a script that was nearly 400 pages and was more of a novel than a shootable screenplay. A great deal of work was done by myself, along with Norman Jewison, to hammer it into shape, but Joe had conceived a great idea.&quot;
Eszterhas was reportedly paid $85,000 for the script. Stallone received $350,000 for acting and $150,000 for writing.

===Filming===

Most of the filming was done in Dubuque, Iowa. Dubuque was chosen firstly because the older sections of the town looked more like Cleveland of the 1930s than Cleveland did at the time, and secondly because of the absence of roof-mounted television antennas due to most of the homes having cable television. Because of the large bluffs, over-the-air television signals had problems reaching homes in the low-lying areas, so a cable system was developed in the mid-1950s, which was considerably earlier than many other municipalities.

Some locations used in filming included St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral, Sacred Heart Church, the Fourth Street Elevator, E.J. Voggenthaler Co. and Dubuque Star Brewery. Filming was also done at the former Caradco manufacturing company in Dubuque. Portions of the Caradco building were fitted with new windows which were then purposely smashed for filming. The windows were replaced by the end of filming. Other Dubuque locations that were also visible in the finished film were the Dubuque County Courthouse and Saint Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church.

Some filming was also done in the English city of Sheffield, Washington D.C. and Culver City Studios.

==Release==

The film premiered as the Gala Opening Night film at Filmex on April 13, 1978, at the Plitt Theatre in Century City and was released in 100 theaters in the United States and Canada on April 26, 1978, before expanding to 350 on June 21.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a success, grossing $20,388,920 on an $8 million budget, though it was not as successful as Stallone&#x27;s previous film &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976).

===Critical response===
&quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; received generally positive reviews from film critics. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; is a big movie that benefits from the accumulating of small, ordinary detail than from any particular wit or inspiration of vision...Like &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Rollerball&quot;, Mr. Jewison&#x27;s last three films, &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; is a massive, essentially shapeless film, but because it&#x27;s about a terrifically interesting, complicated subject, shapeliness doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t seem especially important. There&#x27;s not a moment in it to compare with the intensity of feelings contained in such documentaries as &quot;Union Maids&quot; and &quot;Harlan County, U.S.A&quot;, yet it&#x27;s encouraging to hear Hollywood talking about such things at a time when play-it-safe is virtually industry policy.” Another positive review came from &quot;TV Guide&quot;, which gave the film three stars out of four. They praised Stallone&#x27;s script and acting, saying that &quot;Stallone likes to depart himself from his muscles, it usually doesn&#x27;t work. But, with &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; it works well as he cares more about the character than anything else, something we&#x27;d like to see more of.&quot;

A negative review came from Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot;, who said that the film &quot;stands for nearly hours of almost unmitigated boredom—a misfired would-be proletarian epic with Sylvester Stallone misplaying the Jimmy Hoffa part with a self-confidence that borders on the sublime.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 67% based on 12 reviews. On Metacritic it has a 54% score.

<text>Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI) is a Canadian insurance company and a Crown corporation wholly owned by the Government of Saskatchewan. SGI&#x27;s operations consist of the Saskatchewan Auto Fund, the compulsory public auto insurance program for Saskatchewan, and its property and casualty insurance division sells additional automobile and property insurance products in five Canadian provinces under the trade name SGI Canada.

SGI also operates the driver licensing and motor vehicle registration system for Saskatchewan as part of its oversight of the Auto Fund. The Auto Fund is financially self-sustaining, operating on a break-even basis over time. The Saskatchewan Auto Fund does not receive money from or pay dividends to the government.

Under the SGI Canada brand, SGI sells property and casualty insurance on properties such as homes, farms, businesses and automobile insurance in five Canadian provinces. It operates as SGI Canada in Saskatchewan; SGI Canada Insurance Services Ltd. in Manitoba, Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario; and Coachman Insurance Company in Ontario.

==History==

SGI was created by the first avowedly socialist government in North America elected in 1944, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (later renamed New Democratic Party). Under Premier Tommy Douglas, the government began to involve itself in many sectors of the economy, including insurance. The rationale was put forth that Saskatchewan residents were being taken advantage of by companies owned outside the province who set rates too high. Also, at least 90 per cent of the insurance in the province was written by companies established in Eastern Canada. Thus the institution of a publicly owned insurance company was justified by the government on both philosophical and economic grounds.

Working out of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building, Michael Allore, the first president, sold the first policy – Fire Policy Number 1 – to Minister O. W. Valleau on May 1, 1945, and appointed its first broker, Oscar Sawby of Maple Creek, on May 17. By the end of 1945, SGI had 60 employees and a small network of private, independent insurance brokers located across the province selling insurance on behalf of the corporation.

The introduction of a state-run automobile insurance was controversial. For the first few years of its existence, other provinces refused to recognize SGI policies as legitimate. One result of such non-recognition was that SGI-insured drivers involved in a collision in Manitoba were either detained or required to post a bond because Manitoban authorities essentially considered them to be &quot;uninsured&quot; drivers.

==Corporate governance==

SGI and SGI CANADA are governed by &quot;The Saskatchewan Government Insurance Act&quot;, &quot;1980&quot;, and &quot;The Automobile Accident Insurance Act&quot;, and are subject to the provisions of &quot;The Crown Corporations Act&quot;, &quot;1993&quot;, which gives the Crown Investments Corporation, the holding company for Saskatchewan&#x27;s commercial Crown corporations, the broad authority to set the direction of the corporation.

Where required by legislation or policy directive, SGI submits performance management and investment decisions for review and approval by CIC and the provincial cabinet (government). Through its chair, who is an outside director, the SGI Board of Directors is accountable to the Minister Responsible for SGI. The minister functions as a link between the corporation and CIC and cabinet, as well as the provincial legislature.

==Board of directors==

The board of directors is responsible for setting direction, monitoring and reporting achievement, and analyzing, evaluating and taking corrective action for the corporation. The board is responsible for the stewardship of the corporation in general terms. In meeting this responsibility, the board works with management to develop and approve the corporation&#x27;s strategic plan, operating goals, annual budget and business plans. It participates in identifying business risk and overseeing the implementation of appropriate systems to achieve a balance between the risks incurred and potential returns.

The board of directors is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The board consists of ten external directors. Both the chair and vice-chair of the board are external directors.

==Structure and functions==

SGI employs approximately 2,400 people and works with a network of almost 300 independent insurance brokers and about 450 motor licence issuers in Saskatchewan, as well as numerous brokers in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario.

In October 2008, SGI was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; newsmagazine. Later that month, SGI was named one of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Top Employers, which was announced by the Saskatoon StarPhoenix and Regina Leader-Post newspapers.

SGI&#x27;s head office is in downtown Regina, Saskatchewan. It also operates 20 claims centres in 13 Saskatchewan communities, has branch offices in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Toronto, and five salvage locations (auto wrecker, used parts).

<text>NeXTstation is a high-end workstation computer developed, manufactured, and sold by NeXT from 1990 until 1993. It runs the NeXTSTEP operating system.

==Overview==
The NeXTstation was released as a more affordable alternative to the NeXTcube at about or about half the price. Several models were produced, including the NeXTstation (25 MHz), NeXTstation Turbo (33 MHz), NeXTstation Color (25 MHz) and NeXTstation Turbo Color (33 MHz). In total, NeXT sold about 50,000 computers (not including sales to government organizations), making the NeXTstation a rarity today.

The NeXTstation originally shipped with a NeXT MegaPixel Display 17&quot; monitor (with built-in speakers), keyboard, and mouse. It is nicknamed &quot;the slab&quot;, since the pizza box form factor contrasts quite sharply with the original NeXT Computer&#x27;s basic shape (otherwise known as &quot;the cube&quot;).

The Pyro accelerator board increases the speed of a NeXTstation by replacing the standard 25 MHz processor with a 50 MHz one. There was also a very rare accelerator board known as the Nitro; between 5 and 20 are estimated to have been made. It increased the speed of a NeXTstation Turbo by replacing the standard 33 MHz processor with a 40 MHz one.

John Carmack developed the PC Game &quot;Doom&quot; on a NeXTStation Color.

After NeXT ceased manufacturing hardware in 1993, Canon Computer Systems (a subsidiary of Canon Inc.) acquired the rights to the design of and patents pertaining to the NeXTstation. They later released the Object.Station, an x86-based workstation using the NeXTstation design, in 1994. Canon had been a large stakeholder in NeXT since 1989.

<text>The Adams family is an American political family of English origins in the United States most prominent between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Based in eastern Massachusetts, they formed part of the Boston Brahmin community. The family traces to Henry Adams of Barton St David, Somerset, in England. Its members include U.S. presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. The two presidents and their descendants are also descended from John Alden, who came to the United States on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

The Adams family is one of four families to have produced two presidents of the United States by the same surname; the others being the Bush, Roosevelt, and Harrison families.

==John Adams==

John Adams was born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735, Old Style, Julian calendar), to John Adams Sr. and Susanna Boylston. He had two younger brothers: Peter (1738–1823) and Elihu (1741–1775). Adams was born on the family farm in Braintree, Massachusetts. His mother was from a leading medical family of present-day Brookline, Massachusetts. His father was a deacon in the Congregational Church, a farmer, a cordwainer, and a lieutenant in the militia. John Sr. served as a selectman (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship. Adams&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Henry Adams immigrated to Massachusetts from Braintree, Essex, England, around 1638.

Though raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His family was descended from Puritans, whose strict religious doctrines had profoundly shaped New England&#x27;s culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams&#x27;s birth, Puritan tenets such as predestination had waned and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still &quot;considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency&quot;. Adams recalled that his parents &quot;&#x27;held every Species of Libertinage in ... Contempt and horror,&#x27; ... and painted &#x27;pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin&#x27; that would result from licentious behavior&quot;. Adams later noted that &quot;As a child I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon men – that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form the characters of her children.&quot;

Adams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a dame school for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher&#x27;s home, and was centered upon &quot;The New England Primer&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included Latin, rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams&#x27;s early education included incidents of truancy, a dislike for his master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father&#x27;s command that he remain in school: &quot;You shall comply with my desires.&quot; Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively.

==Family religion==
Adams was raised a Congregationalist but left the denomination as a young man. By his early 20s, he identified as a Unitarian, a Protestant denomination that had been recently formed. Adams always felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His family was descended from Puritans, whose strict religious doctrines had profoundly shaped New England&#x27;s culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of his birth, the Congregationalists no longer called themselves &quot;Puritans&quot;; their severe practices had largely been dropped in the First Great Awakening of the 1730s. Adams praised them historically as bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency&quot;. Adams recalled that his parents &quot;held every Species of Libertinage in ... Contempt and horror&quot;, and detailed &quot;pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin&quot; resulting from any debauchery. 

According to Dr. Sara Georgini, editor of &quot;The John Adams Papers&quot;: From John Adams through his grandson Charles Francis, the Adams family creed was conventionally Unitarian. They believed in a guiding Providence. They trusted that human will empowered them to freely accept or reject God’s grace. They turned away from miracles and revelation, preferring biblical criticism and lay inquiry to broaden the mind beyond the passive reception of dogma. Acknowledging Jesus as a “master workman” and gifted moral teacher, they grew fuzzy about his divinity, opting instead to scrutinize his teachings and doctrines as they related to contemporary culture. In line with their Protestant peers, most Adamses mistrusted the sensory emphasis and hierarchical nature of “Romish” Catholicism, but they revered Judaism as a source of lawmaking and ethics.

<doc id="635998" wikidata="Q646801" url="?curid=635998" title="Pluster World">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series that originally aired on TV Tokyo from April 2003 to March 2004. It was produced by Nihon Ad Systems.

== Story ==
According to legend, the peaceful Pluster World fell into chaos with the appearance of the Minusters, and in response, all of the Plusters fought alongside the humans, or, more specifically, merging with them in order to become more powerful (&quot;plusting&quot;), and were able to seal away the evil Minusters. The resulting peace was thought to continue forever, with the world once again returning to fruition, but the peace has been shattered again by the reappearance of the Minusters.

Beetma, a Pluster from the Kabuto Tribe, on a journey to become the most powerful Pluster, meets up with Wyburst from the Grip Tribe, as well as a Minus-Beast. Completely overmatched in battle, Beetma accidentally finds himself sent to the world of humans, where he meets an 11-year-old boy named Tohma Kaname, hoping for revenge on the Minus-Beast. Wyburst, looking for the legendary Gonggorahgong, eventually joins them on their quest to defeat the Minusters as they meet many other Plusters and journey onward.

<doc id="636000" wikidata="Q1772915" url="?curid=636000" title="Cruiser Mk II">
<text>The Tank, Cruiser, Mk II (A10), was a cruiser tank developed alongside the A9 cruiser tank, and was intended to be a heavier, infantry tank version of that type. In practice, it was not deemed suitable for the infantry tank role and was classified as a &quot;heavy cruiser&quot;. It served briefly in World War II.

==History and specifications==
The A10 was developed by Sir John Carden of Vickers in 1934 by the adaptation of his A9 design. The A10 specification called for armour of up to standard (the A9 was ); a speed of ) was acceptable. The two sub-turrets present on the A9 were removed, and extra armour bolted onto that already present on the front and sides of the hull, along with all faces of the turret, providing approximately twice the armour in most areas. The A10 was two tonnes heavier than the A9, but used the same engine, and as a consequence the tank&#x27;s top speed was cut from to .

The turret armament consisted of a QF 2-pounder (40-mm) gun and a coaxial .303 Vickers machine gun. For the production version, there was a 7.92 mm BESA machine gun mounted in the hull in a barbette to the right of the driver. This was added to give extra firepower, but at the expense of simplicity - the Vickers and the BESA using different ammunition. The tank had a crew of five (Commander, gunner, loader, driver and hull machine gunner). There was no separation between the driver&#x27;s compartment and the fighting compartments.

The prototype (&quot;Tank, Experimental A10E1&quot;) was completed in 1936, a few months after the A9 prototype. Carden had died in an air crash in 1935 and development was slower than expected. In 1937, the A10 was dropped as an infantry support tank, but in 1938 it was decided to produce an order of 75 as an interim &quot;heavy cruiser&quot;.

The A10 was accepted for service - initially as &quot;Tank, Cruiser, Heavy Mk I&quot; and then &quot;Tank, Cruiser A10 Mk I&quot; and finally &quot;Tank, Cruiser Mk II&quot;. Production was ordered in July 1938. Total production was 175 vehicles, including the 30 CS versions (see below); 45 were built by Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company, 45 by Metropolitan-Cammell, 10 by Vickers. In late 1939, another order was placed with Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company, this time for a larger order of 75 vehicles. Entering service in December 1939 the tank was something of an oddity, it had been intended to sacrifice speed for armour like an Infantry tank but was still relatively poorly armoured and not effective.

==Combat history==

A number of Mark IIs were part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sent to France in the early stages of the Second World War. The cross country performance was recorded as poor, but they were still used later in North Africa at the defence of Tobruk in 1941, where reliability and suspension performance in the desert conditions was praised. Sixty worn out examples were taken to Greece by the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and, although they performed well against the German tanks, over 90% were lost due to mechanical breakdowns as opposed to enemy action (mainly lost tracks).

==Variants==
In total, 61 with Vickers machine guns and 99 with Besa machine guns were produced.

;Tank, Cruiser, Mk II (A10 Mk I)
Classified as a &#x27;heavy cruiser&#x27;, 31 were sent to France with the 1st Armoured Division, but performed poorly in the Battle of France. The tank also served in the North African Campaign until late 1941.

;Tank, Cruiser, Mk IIA (A10 Mk IA)
The coaxial Vickers machine guns were replaced with BESA machine guns. Armoured radio housing added.

;Tank, Cruiser, Mk IIA CS (A10 Mk IA CS)

The CS (Close Support) version of the Mark II had a howitzer in the turret instead of the 2-pdr. The standard ammunition load was 40 rounds smoke, and a few HE shells.

This weapon was derived from a World War I field howitzer, the QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer. It was not related to the 3-inch (76 mm) howitzer used in later British tanks in the Second World War, which was itself replaced by a howitzer in the later versions of the Churchill infantry tanks and all CS versions of the Centaur and Cromwell cruiser tanks. British doctrine was that the CS tank was to provide smoke cover in advances or retreats and hence many more smoke rounds were carried than HE.

==Related vehicles==
The Valentine used the suspension and transmission of the A10 but with a much more heavily armoured hull and turret.

<text>Joseph Christopher Yates (November 9, 1768March 19, 1837) was an American lawyer, politician, statesman, and founding trustee of Union College. He served as the seventh governor of New York, from January 1, 1823 – December 31, 1824.

==History==
Born in 1768 in Schenectady in the Province of New York in the colonial era to Colonel Christopher P. Yates and Jannetje Bradt, Yates rose during the early Federal period after the United States gained independence in the American Revolutionary War. He read the law with an established firm and passed the bar. 

He served as the mayor of Schenectady (beginning in 1798), being appointed successively to twelve one-year terms. In 1805 he was elected as a state senator, in 1808 as a State Supreme Court justice, and in 1823 as the seventh governor of New York (1823–1824). Yates is the only Governor of New York to have been born in Schenectady County, which was settled in the early Dutch colonial period. 

In his public life, Yates served also as a founding Trustee of Union College, established in 1795 in Schenectady. The private college became well known. Yates also served as President of the Schenectady Savings Bank. Yates was selected as a presidential elector in 1828.

His residence in Schenectady, during the period when he served as governor, survives on Front Street near the Mohawk River. It is a contributing property in the city&#x27;s listed Stockade Historic District.

As Governor, Yates sat for a portrait by John Vanderlyn, an American painter famed for his portrayals of such eminent political figures as George Washington, Aaron Burr, James Monroe, George Clinton, Andrew Jackson and Zachary Taylor. The painting is owned by the City of New York.

==Family==
Joseph was born to Christopher &quot;Colonel Stoeffel&quot; Yates and his wife Jannetje Bradt in the autumn of 1768.

In the course of his life he married three times: the first was said to be for love: Ann, widow of James Ellice ; the second was for money, Maria, daughter of John Kane and his wife; and the last was for clout, as he required her connections to further his ambitious political career, Elizabeth De Lancey, a daughter of John De Lancey and his wife, of Westchester County, New York.

Yates had three children, all daughters: Helen Maria, the oldest, was born on September 28, 1797. She later married Colonel John K. Paige and died January 25, 1829. Anna Alida was born September 14, 1806, and married John D. Watkins, a resident of Georgia. Jane Josepha was born November 6, 1811, and married Samuel Neil of New York.

==Death and legacy==
Joseph C. Yates died on March 19, 1837. He was buried in a family cemetery in Schenectady County, New York. In 1889, his youngest daughter, Jane (Yates) Neil, arranged to reinter the remains of her father Joseph and those of several other Yates family members to her husband&#x27;s Neil family mausoleum in the churchyard of St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Bronx County, New York. The Neil family mausoleum has no indication that Gov. Yates is interred there.

Yates County, New York and the Town of Yates are named after former Governor Yates.

<text>The lunitidal interval measures the time lag from lunar culmination to the next high tide at a given location. It is also called the high water interval (HWI). Sometimes a term is not used for the time lag, but instead the terms &quot;age&quot; or &quot;establishment&quot; of the tide are used for the entry that is in tide tables.

Tides are known to be mainly caused by the Moon&#x27;s gravity. Theoretically, peak tidal forces at a given location would concur when the Moon reaches the meridian, but a delay usually precedes high tide, depending largely on the shape of the coastline and the sea floor. Therefore, the lunitidal interval varies from place to place – from three hours over deep oceans to eight hours at New York Harbor. The lunitidal interval further varies within about 3h ± 30 minutes according to the lunar phase. (This is caused by the time interval associated with the solar tides.)

Hundreds of factors are involved in the lunitidal interval, especially near the shoreline. However, for those far away enough from the coast, the dominating consideration is the speed of gravity waves, which increases with the water&#x27;s depth. It is proportional to the square root of the depth, for the extremely long gravity waves that transport the water that is following the Moon around the Earth. The oceans are about deep and would have to be at least deep for these waves to keep up with the Moon. As mentioned above, a similar time lag accompanies the solar tides, a complicating factor that varies with the lunar phases. By observing the age of leap tides, it becomes clear that the delay can actually exceed 24 hours in some locations.

The approximate lunitidal interval can be calculated if the moonrise, moonset, and high tide times are known for a location. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Moon reaches its highest point when it is southernmost in the sky. Lunar data are available from printed or online tables. Tide tables forecast the time of the next high water. The difference between these two times is the lunitidal interval. This value can be used to calibrate tide clock and wristwatches to allow for simple but crude tidal predictions. Unfortunately, the lunitidal intervals vary day-by-day even at a given location.

<text>Watterson Towers is a student residence hall at Illinois State University, and is said by the university to be one of the tallest dormitory buildings in the world at 298.5 feet. Located in Normal, Illinois, at the corner of Fell and Beaufort Streets, it was completed in 1969. The 28-story complex holds over 2,200 students and stands at 91m (298.5 feet), making it one of the tallest brutalist structures in the world. Watterson Towers was named after Arthur W. Watterson, a popular professor and chair of the ISU Geography Department, who taught at the University from 1946–1966. The building was designed by Fridstein and Fitch Architects in Chicago, and built by C. Iber and Sons Company of Peoria, Illinois.

Externally, the most noticeable feature of the building is that it consists of two separate towers. From the outside an observer sees that the two towers are connected at several points by breezeways. However, to the residents, this division into towers goes almost unnoticed, as what is far more important is the internal division of the building into houses. Watterson is composed of ten of these houses, (five in each tower), and each is considered—in terms of campus governance—to be its own residence hall. The houses used to be named after the first ten secretaries of state of the United States. As of 2020 each house is now an alphabet letter. A house at the bottom, and E house at the top.

Each &quot;house&quot; consists of five consecutive floors of a tower. Houses at the same level are paired both physically (in terms of access, see below) and in terms of student governance. For example, the bottom five residential floors of the South Tower and the bottom five residential floors of the North Tower comprise &quot;[A North/South] collectively.

Within each house, most floors are divided into four &quot;suites&quot; consisting of six rooms each. The suites include four double occupancy rooms, a triple room, and a single occupancy room. However, on the middle (third) floor of each house, there are only two suites, as the area for the other two suites is taken up by other things, including the connecting breezeways and some study lounges.

Watterson Towers is the tallest structure in Bloomington-Normal, and can be seen when entering the twin cities from either direction.
==Renovations==
Watterson Towers, now more than 50 years old, experienced a complete restoration, which was completed using the houses as stages. The food court renovations were completed in 2010, and all work was completed by early 2013.

==Falling incidents==

===Student jumps to her death===
In 1971, a 21-year old ISU student jumped to her death after prying off a mesh screen from the window of her 18th floor room. The Oak Lawn woman&#x27;s death was the first fatal fall from a high rise building on ISU&#x27;s campus.

===Student survives fall from window===
In 1987, an 18-year-old student was critically injured when she fell from an 18th floor window. The student reported that she had leaned against the interior screen to wave to a friend when the barrier gave way.

===Halloween trespasser falls to her death===
On Halloween weekend 2011 a 45-year-old woman attempted to climb the 28 story building by using the scaffolding (being used for renovations) on the east side of the building. Reports say she leaned back on the scaffolding and plummeted 200 feet to her death in front of hundreds of spectators. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The woman was not a student.

<doc id="636017" wikidata="Q37888" url="?curid=636017" title="Cairn Terrier">
<text>The Cairn Terrier is a terrier breed originating in the Scottish Highlands and recognised as one of Scotland&#x27;s earliest working dogs.

The name &quot;Cairn Terrier&quot; was a compromise suggestion when the breed was brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909, initially under the name &quot;Short-haired Skye terrier&quot;. This name was not accepted by the Kennel Club when faced with opposition from breeders of the Skye Terrier. The alternative name Cairn Terrier was adopted.

== History ==
Cairn terriers originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Isle of Skye. Prior to 1873, terriers in Scotland were collectively referred to as &#x27;Scottish Terriers&#x27;. In the early days of the breed&#x27;s establishment, the name &#x27;short haired Skye Terrier&#x27; was used. After concerns raised by the Skye Terrier Club, the name &#x27;Cairn Terrier&#x27; was given to the breed instead. The name &#x27;Cairn Terrier&#x27; comes from cairns, where the terriers often flushed out vermin.

The Cairn Terrier was registered into the American Kennel Club in 1903. The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom gave the Cairn Terrier a separate register in 1912; the first year of recognition, 134 were registered, and the breed was given Championship status. While registration of white Cairns was once permitted, after 1917, the American Kennel Club required them to be registered as West Highland White Terriers. The dog was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationalein 1963.

== Description ==
The Cairn Terrier has a harsh, weather-resistant outer coat that can be black, cream, wheaten, red, sandy, gray, or brindled. Pure black, black and tan, and white are not permitted by many kennel clubs. A notable characteristic of Cairns is that brindled Cairns frequently change colour throughout their lifetimes. It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn to become progressively more black or silver as it ages. The Cairn is double-coated, with a soft, dense undercoat and a harsh outer coat. A well-groomed Cairn has a rough-and-ready appearance.

Cairn Terriers tend to look similar to Norwich Terriers, but with some differences (for example the shaggy fur). The outer layer of fur is shaggy, but they have a soft, downy undercoat. The ideal height is roughly , with weight in proportion, usually some .
== Health ==
A 2015 French study found a life expectancy of 13.42 years. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Some of the more common hereditary health problems found in the Cairn are:
* Bronchoesophageal fistula
* Cataracts
* Corneal dystrophy
* Craniomandibular osteopathy (lion jaw)
* Diabetes mellitus
* Entropion
* Hip dysplasia
* Hypothyroidism
* Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy)
* Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease
* Lens luxation
* Luxating patella
* Ocular melanosis
* Portosystemic shunt
* Progressive retinal atrophy
* Soft-tissue sarcoma
* Von Willebrand disease

The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

<doc id="636020" wikidata="Q881557" url="?curid=636020" title="Nathaniel Pitcher">
<text>Nathaniel Pitcher (November 30, 1777 – May 25, 1836) was an American lawyer and politician who served in Congress and as the eighth governor of New York from February 11 to December 31, 1828.

Pitcher was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, and raised in Sandy Hill, New York (Hudson Falls). He was educated in Sandy Hill, studied law, was admitted to the bar, and became an attorney. He became active in politics as a Democratic-Republican, and served in local offices including town supervisor and justice of the peace. He served in the New York State Assembly, as probate court judge of Washington County, and as a federal tax assessor during the War of 1812. He was also a longtime veteran of the New York Militia; he served during the War of 1812, and after the war he commanded a brigade with the rank of brigadier general.

Pitcher served in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1823. He became lieutenant governor in 1827, and he succeeded to the governorship in 1828, following the death of DeWitt Clinton. He was succeeded as governor by Martin Van Buren. Pitcher served another term in the U.S. House from 1831 to 1833. He died in Sandy Hill on May 25, 1836 and was buried at Baker Cemetery in Hudson Falls.

==Early life==
Pitcher was born in Litchfield on November 30, 1777. He was the son of Nathaniel Pitcher Sr. (1750–1802), a veteran of the American Revolution who led the detachment that captured Lake George&#x27;s Fort George from the British in 1775. The younger Pitcher was raised and educated in Sandy Hill, New York (now Hudson Falls). He studied law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Sandy Hill.

==Early career==
Pitcher entered politics as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served as Kingsbury&#x27;s town supervisor from 1804 to 1810. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1806 to 1807, 1815 to 1816, and 1816 to 1818.

From 1812 to 1813, Pitcher served as surrogate judge of Washington County. He was Kingsbury&#x27;s town clerk in 1813 and 1814, and also served as a justice of the peace, with appointments in 1804, 1806, 1807, 1808, and 1811. During the War of 1812, Pitcher was appointed the federal revenue assessor for the 10th District of New York, which included Washington County, and was responsible for collecting taxes imposed to support the war effort.

==Military career==
Pitcher&#x27;s father had been active in the militia, and the younger Nathaniel Pitcher followed him into military service, receiving his commission as an ensign in 1802. In 1808 he was appointed as adjutant of the regiment commanded by Micajah Pettit. Later in 1808 he was promoted to major, and appointed as inspector of the brigade commanded by Warren Ferris. In 1814, Pitcher was included in a militia detail of 13,500 soldiers that was activated for federal service during military operations on the Canada-western New York border during the War of 1812.

In 1815, Pitcher was appointed lieutenant colonel and second in command of the militia&#x27;s 121st Regiment. Later in 1815, he succeeded Pettit as commander of the 17th Brigade, and was promoted to brigadier general. As a result of his military service, Pitcher was frequently referred to in public records and newspaper stories as &quot;General Pitcher&quot; or &quot;Gen. Pitcher&quot;.

==Later career==
He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 16th and 17th Congresses (March 4, 1819 – March 3, 1823). He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1821.

Pitcher was Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1827 and 1828 and became Governor of New York upon the death of Governor DeWitt Clinton. He completed Clinton&#x27;s term, February 11, 1828, to December 31, 1828, and was succeeded by Martin Van Buren.

He was again elected as a Jacksonian to the 22nd Congress (March 4, 1831 – March 3, 1833).

==Death and burial==
Pitcher died in Hudson Falls on May 25, 1836, and was buried at Baker Cemetery in Hudson Falls.

==Family==
Pitcher&#x27;s first wife was Margaret Scott (1782–1815). Their children included sons Augustus (1808–1876), Matthew Scott (1810–1858), and Montgomery Pike (1813–1841).

On March 15, 1823, Pitcher was married to Anna B. Merritt (1791–1824) of Freedom Plains, New York. She became ill and died soon after giving birth to their son Edward Merritt (1824–1860). Edward Merritt Pitcher moved to California in the 1840s, where he was an early settler of Sacramento, and a member of Sacramento County&#x27;s first board of supervisors.

Pitcher&#x27;s siblings included Zina Pitcher, a prominent physician and mayor of Detroit.

==Legacy==
The town of Pitcher in Chenango County is named for Pitcher.

==Attempts to locate portrait==
Pitcher is the only Governor of New York for whom no likeness is known to exist, and attempts to locate one have proved unsuccessful. One image that is sometimes identified as a portrait of Pitcher is not his likeness, as the clothing worn by the subject and the facial hair clearly date it to the 1850s–1860s era, at least 20 years after Pitcher died.

<text>Artur London (1 February 1915 – 8 November 1986) was a Czechoslovak communist politician and co-defendant in the Slánský Trial in 1952. Though he was sentenced to life in prison, he was freed in 1955; he then settled in France with his wife Lise London. In 1968 he published his memoirs in &quot;L&#x27;Aveu&quot; (&quot;The Confession&quot;), a book which resonated internationally, adapted by Costa-Gavras as the movie of the same name.

==Biography==
London was born in Ostrava, Moravia, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic) to a Jewish family.

London spent 1934 to 1937 in Moscow. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, he left for Barcelona where he worked for SIM (Servicio de Información Militar), an intelligence service run by the Soviet NKVD. He moved to France after the defeat of the Republicans. In World War II, he was active in the French resistance, was arrested by the Nazis and sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp. After the war, he lived in Switzerland but soon moved with family to Prague, where he became a leading figure in the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and was eventually nominated deputy minister of foreign affairs in 1948.

In 1951, he was arrested and became a co-defendant with Rudolf Slánský in the Slánský trial, one of several show trials against Eastern European communists at the time. Accused of being a Zionist, Trotskyite and Titoist, he was forced to confess and sentenced to life in prison. After the Slánský trial, London collaborated with the authorities and served as a lead witness in other construed political processes against top Czechoslovak communists, such as Eduard Goldstücker, Josef Pavel, Osvald Závodský, Gustáv Husák, Otakar Hromádko and others.

Following Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, London was released in 1955. After his rehabilitation in 1963, he moved to France with his wife, Lise London, a French communist he had met in Moscow. In 1963, London published &quot;Espagne,&quot; a book about his time in the Spanish civil war. The couple wrote the book &quot;L’Aveu&quot; (1968), an autobiographical account of his ordeal in the Prague Trials. The English translation &quot;The Confession&quot; by Alastair Hamilton appeared in 1968. (In the United Kingdom, the translation was published in 1970 under the title &quot;On Trial&quot;). While the main defendants were senior to London, he gained prominence worldwide by writing the book.

The book was the basis for the film &quot;The Confession&quot; (1970) directed by Costa-Gavras, starring Yves Montand and Simone Signoret. Chris Marker made the short film &quot;On vous parle de Prague: Le deuxième procès d&#x27;Artur London,&quot; an on-set documentary about the making of this movie. Lise later narrated the documentary &quot;A Trial in Prague&quot;, directed by Zuzana Justman (2002, 83min).

Artur London died in Paris in 1986, aged 71. Lise died there in 2012, aged 96. They are both buried in the PCF plot at Ivry Cemetery in Ivry-sur-Seine.

<doc id="636023" wikidata="Q7996997" url="?curid=636023" title="Whizzer and Chips">
<text>Whizzer and Chips was a British comics magazine that ran from 18 October 1969 to 27 October 1990, when it merged with the comic &quot;Buster&quot;. As with most comics of the time, &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; was dated one week ahead of the day it actually appeared on newsstands in Great Britain (the date referred to the day the comic needed to be taken off the shelves to make way for the new issue, rather than a release date). It had no relation to the earlier British comic &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot; (which ran from 1890 to 1953).

The format of &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; presented the comic as being divided into two separate parts — a novel idea at the time. One part was called &quot;Whizzer&quot; and the other was called &quot;Chips&quot;, with &quot;Chips&quot; existing as a separate pull-out section in the middle. The slogan &quot;Two comics in one, double the fun!&quot; was used. In the offices of publisher Fleetway, &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; was always regarded as one comic.

In common with most British comics of the time, both sections originally had some of their strips printed in semi-colour using black, white, and red (duotone), with others in plain black and white. To reinforce the distinction between the two sections, the duotone strips in &quot;Chips&quot; were later changed to black, white, and blue. &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; went full colour on the week of 4 May 1990.

The comic &quot;Knockout&quot; merged with &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; on 30 June 1973, as did &quot;Krazy&quot; in 1978, &quot;Whoopee!&quot; in 1985 and finally &quot;Scouse Mouse&quot; in 1989.

==Concepts==
One ongoing concept was that the two comics were fierce rivals. A guest appearance by a character from one of the comic strips in the story of one in the other magazine would be described as a &quot;raid&quot;, and the other comic would seek its revenge with a raid of its own the following week. The first raid appeared in issue 2.

Readers were encouraged to become either a &quot;Whizz-Kid&quot; or a &quot;Chip-ite&quot;, depending on which section they preferred. The leader of the Whizz-Kids was a boy called Sid and his snake Slippy, from the &quot;Sid&#x27;s Snake&quot; comic strip. The leader of the Chip-ites was a boy called Shiner from the comic strip of the same name, who had aspirations to become a boxer and always ended up with a black eye (the eponymous &quot;shiner&quot;). In the first issue of &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;, &quot;Sid&#x27;s Snake&quot; was on the cover of &quot;Chips&quot;, for Shiner did not appear until issue 2.

<doc id="636026" wikidata="Q733364" url="?curid=636026" title="Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)">
<text>The Battle of Megiddo (fought 15th century BC) was fought between Egyptian forces under the command of Pharaoh Thutmose III and a large rebellious coalition of Canaanite vassal states led by the king of Kadesh. It is the first battle to have been recorded in what is accepted as relatively reliable detail. Megiddo is also the first recorded use of the composite bow and the first body count. All details of the battle come from Egyptian sources—primarily the hieroglyphic writings on the Hall of Annals in the Temple of Amun-Re at Karnak, Thebes (now Luxor), by the military scribe Tjaneni.

The ancient Egyptian account gives the date of the battle as the 21st day of the first month of the third season, of Year 23 of the reign of Thutmose III. It has been claimed that this was April 16, 1457 BC, according to the Middle Chronology, although other publications place the battle in 1482 BC or 1479 BC. The Egyptians routed the Canaanite forces, which fled to safety in the city of Megiddo. Their action resulted in the lengthy siege of Megiddo.

By reestablishing Egyptian dominance in the Levant, Thutmose III began a reign in which the Egyptian Empire reached its greatest expanse.

==Annals of Thutmose III==
During Thutmose III&#x27;s first campaign in the Levant, his personal scribe, Tjaneni, kept a daily journal on parchment. In approximately his 42nd regnal year, many years after his campaigns in the Levant had ended, Thutmose III instructed his artisans to inscribe his military exploits into the walls of Amun-Re&#x27;s temple at Karnak. The annals describe in lavish detail 14 campaigns led by Thutmose III in the Levant, the booty gained through his campaigning, tribute received from conquered regions, and, lastly, offerings to Amun-Re. The sequence of depictions indicate the New Kingdom&#x27;s belief on the interactions of the gods with warfare: praise and offerings to the deities in exchange for their divine help in war.

Additionally, the annals show the long-lasting effects of the battle of Megiddo. After Thutmose III&#x27;s victory at Megiddo and his successful campaigns in the Levant over the next 20 years, Egypt&#x27;s rise to power in the international community and its evolution into an empire is evident in the annals. Depictions show international diplomacy through the giving of gifts from Babylon, the Hittite Empire, and other prominent and powerful regions during this time period.

==Campaign against the kingdoms of Canaan==
Pharaoh Thutmose III began a reign in which the Egyptian Empire reached its greatest expanse by reinforcing the long-standing Egyptian presence in the Levant. After waiting impatiently for the end of his regency by the Egyptian Pharaoh Hatshepsut, he immediately responded to a revolt of local rulers near Kadesh in the vicinity of modern-day Syria. As Egyptian buffer provinces in the land of the Amurru along the border with the Hittites attempted to change their vassalage, Thutmose III dealt with the threat personally. The Canaanites are thought to have been allied with the Mitanni and Amurru from the region of the two rivers between the headwaters of the Orontes and the Jordan. The driving and main force behind this revolt was the King of Kadesh. The powerful fortress of Kadesh offered protection to him and the city. The King of Megiddo, with an equally strong fortress, joined the alliance. The importance of Megiddo was its geographical location along the southwestern edge of the Jezreel Valley just beyond the Mount Carmel ridge and the Mediterranean. From this location, Megiddo controlled the Via Maris, the main trade route between Egypt and Mesopotamia.

The Egyptian inscriptions of the campaign on the Temple of Karnak come from a daily journal kept by the scribe Tjaneni during the campaign. In the Egyptian account Thutmose gathered an army of chariots and infantry numbering between ten and twenty thousand men. As the Egyptians mustered their forces, the king of Kadesh gathered many tribal chieftains from Syria, Aram and Canaan around him, estimated at between ten and fifteen thousand men, entered Megiddo and set his forces at the waters of Taanach. He expected that the Egyptians would come by way of Taanach via Dothaim, the main route from the Mediterranean lowlands into the Valley of Kishon, and from Egypt to Mesopotamia. The Egyptian army assembled at the border fortress of Tjaru (called &quot;Sele&quot; in Greek) and arrived ten days later at the loyal city of Gaza. After one day&#x27;s rest, it marched north for eleven days to the city of Yehem (now Khirbet Yemmeh, south of Jatt). Here, Thutmose sent out scouts. To continue northeast from Yehem, the army had to pass the Carmel mountain range, beyond which lay the Jezreel Valley and the city and fortress of Megiddo, where the rebel forces had gathered. There were three possible routes from Yehem to Megiddo. Both the northern route, via Zefti and Yokneam, and the southern route, by way of Taanach, were safer but longer routes. The central route, via Aruna (modern Wadi Ara), was more direct but risky; it followed a narrow ravine, and the troops could only travel single-file. If the enemy waited at the end of the ravine, the Egyptians would risk being cut down piecemeal. The army leaders pleaded with him not to take the difficult road but to take either of the safer routes. Instead, with information from the scouts, Thutmose III decided to take the direct path to Megiddo. He believed that if his generals advised him to take the easier routes, then his enemy would assume he would do so, so he decided to do the unexpected.

The King of Kadesh had left large infantry detachments guarding the two more likely paths, and virtually ignored the Aruna route. Ignoring the danger of spreading out his army in the mountains where leading elements might be subject to enemy ambush in narrow mountain passes, and his main force still far behind in Aruna, unable to come to their aid, Thutmose took the direct route through Aruna (Wadi Ara). To reduce the risk, Thutmose himself led his men through Aruna. His light infantry and the mounted bowmen known as &quot;haibrw&quot; moved in quickly to eliminate any rebel pickets, leaving the main force of chariots to follow. With the city lightly guarded by the enemy, Thutmose led a quick assault, scattered the rebels and entered the valley unopposed. Now, the Egyptian army had a clear path to Megiddo, with the main forces of the rebel army far away to the northwest and southeast.

==Battle and siege==
Thutmose seized the opportunity. He set up camp at the end of the day, but during the night arrayed his forces close to the enemy; the next morning, they attacked. It cannot be established if the surprised King of Kadesh had managed to fully prepare for battle. Even if he did, it did not do him much good. Though his forces were on high ground adjacent to the fortress, the Egyptian line was arranged in a concave formation, consisting of three wings, that threatened both Canaanite flanks. Both the Egyptians and the Canaanites are estimated to have had around 1,000 chariots and 10,000 infantry. The Pharaoh led the attack from the center. The combination of position and numbers, superior maneuverability of their left wing along with an early, bold attack, broke the enemy&#x27;s will; their line immediately collapsed. Those near the city fled into it, closing the gates behind them.

The Egyptian soldiers fell to plundering the enemy camp. During the plunder they captured 924 chariots and 200 suits of armor. Unfortunately for the Egyptians, during this confusion, the scattered Canaanite forces, including the kings of Kadesh and Megiddo, were able to rejoin the defenders inside the city. Those inside lowered tied-together clothing to the men and chariots and pulled them up over the walls. Thus, the opportunity of a quick capture of the city following the battle was lost.

The city was besieged for seven months and the King of Kadesh escaped. Thutmose built a moat and a wooden palisade, eventually forcing its occupants to surrender. At Karnak it is recorded that the victorious army took home 340 prisoners, 2,041 mares, 191 foals, six stallions, 924 chariots, 200 suits of armor, 502 bows, 1,929 cattle, 22,500 sheep, and the royal armor, chariot and tent-poles of the King of Megiddo. The city and citizens were spared. A number of other cities in the Jezreel Valley were conquered and Egyptian authority in the area was restored.

==Results==
Egypt&#x27;s realm was expanded by this campaign. As Paul K. Davis wrote, &quot;By reestablishing Egyptian dominance in Canaan, Thutmose began a reign in which Egypt reached its greatest expanse as an empire.&quot; Thutmose III required from the defeated kings that they each send a son to the Egyptian court. There, they received an Egyptian education. When they returned to their homelands, they governed with Egyptian sympathies. Nevertheless, the victory at Megiddo was only the beginning of the pacification of the Levant. Only after several further campaigns, conducted almost annually, was the unrest cooled. One unanticipated result came in the form of the word Armageddon, which took its root from Megiddo&#x27;s name.

<doc id="636032" wikidata="Q913818" url="?curid=636032" title="Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)">
<text>This Battle of Megiddo is recorded as having taken place in 609 BC, when Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt led his army to Carchemish (northern Syria) to join with his allies, the fading Neo-Assyrian Empire, against the surging Neo-Babylonian Empire. This required passing through territory controlled by the Kingdom of Judah. The Judaean king Josiah refused to let the Egyptians pass. The Judaean forces battled the Egyptians at Megiddo, resulting in Josiah&#x27;s death and his kingdom becoming a vassal state of Egypt. The battle is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, the Greek 1 Esdras, and the writings of Jewish historian Josephus.

While Necho II gained control of the Kingdom of Judah, the Assyrian forces lost to the Babylonians and Medes at the Fall of Harran, after which Assyria largely ceased to exist as an independent state.

== Biblical accounts ==
The basic story is told in 2 Kings 23:29–30 (written c. 550 BC). The Hebrew text here has been misunderstood and translated as Necho going &quot;against&quot; Assyria. Eric H. Cline noted that most modern translations try to improve this passage by taking into account what we now know from other historical sources, namely that Egypt and Assyria were then allies. The original text also does not mention a &quot;battle&quot;, yet some modern versions add the word &quot;battle&quot; to the text.
In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. King Josiah went to meet him; and Pharaoh Neco slew him at Megiddo, when he saw him. And his servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb.

There is a longer account recorded later in II Chronicles 35:20–25 (written c. 350–300 BC).
After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt came up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to engage him. But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, &quot;What have we to do with each other, O King of Judah? I am not coming against you today but against the house with which I am at war, and God has ordered me to hurry. Stop for your own sake from interfering with God who is with me, so that He will not destroy you.&quot; However, Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to make war with him; nor did he listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to make war on the plain of Megiddo. The archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, &quot;Take me away, for I am badly wounded.&quot; So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers.

=== Debate over II Chronicles ===
Cline explained that there is a division of opinion as to the accuracy of the above account. On one side are the scholars who believe that it is an accurate report of a surprise attack by Josiah. On the other are those who point out that it would not be the only time the Chronicler &quot;improved&quot; a story. From being wounded by an arrow to his burial in Jerusalem, the story resembles perhaps too closely stories from I and II Kings about Ahab of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah, events which occurred at least two centuries before Josiah&#x27;s death. Cline suggests that the Chronicler used details from these stories in Josiah&#x27;s story.

Cline also suggests the possibility that there may not have been a historical battle of Megiddo involving Josiah since there is little historical attestation for it outside the Bible. For example, Josiah may have been killed by Necho in some other circumstances.

== Other accounts ==

=== Jewish ===
The account in Esdras adds some minor details, with the basic difference between it and the earlier account in the Book of Chronicles being that Josiah is described only as being &#x27;weak&#x27; at Megiddo and asks to be taken back to Jerusalem, where he dies. Cline points out that this brings the story more in line with an earlier prophecy made by the prophetess Huldah (II Kings 22:15–20).

Seven centuries after Josiah&#x27;s death, Josephus also wrote an account of the events. This contains more details about Josiah&#x27;s movements on the battlefield, which have been suggested come from documents now lost, but Cline suggests it is based on the biblical accounts and perhaps Josephus&#x27;s own views.

The battle is also discussed in the Talmud, where it says that Josiah did not let the Egyptians pass because of a passage in the Bible that says &quot;A sword shall not pass through your land&quot; (Leviticus 26:6 Taanis 22b)

Also mentioning the Battle is the &quot;Kinnah&quot; for the 9th of Av, &quot;And Jeremiah lamented over Josiah&quot; (Kinnah 11), which seems to give a vague picture of the battle. The Judeans held the high ground, atop the hill, where they attempted to shower the advancing Egyptians with arrows. The Judean &quot;professional&quot; infantry of the time seems to have been some sort of force of hand-to-hand combatants who were also equipped with bows. Egyptian chariots charging seems to have driven them back, whereupon the now-damaged Judean infantry was attacked by the Egyptian infantry. Desperately trying to maintain his men&#x27;s morale, Josiah ordered his charioteer to position his chariot right behind his center. Although the Kerathites advised the King to retreat, Josiah adamantly refused. Seeing the Judean royal standard, the Egyptian archers focused on Josiah as a target, and though he was struck 300 times, only one arrow seems to have found its mark, possibly striking him under the left arm. Josiah is withdrawn from the battle, gravely wounded, and, seeing their king retreat, the Judean army loses hope as well, and a rout follows.

=== Greek ===
Finally, there is the suggestion that Herodotus records this battle and the Egyptian campaign in his writings about the pharaoh Necho, which are included in his famous Histories:

A view at the topography of the place around the city reveals that Megiddo is a small rise among others on a small elevated plateau close to a large level coastal plain large enough to accommodate many thousands of troops. Since it does dominate the surrounding area, it is not an obvious target, but it is useful as a garrison and has a water source from the Kishon River. That explains why Josiah used the terrain to mask his approach as he attempted to ambush the Egyptian army that was on its way to attack the Babylonians in Mesopotamia.

== Aftermath ==
Judah fell under the control and influence of Dynasty XXVI of Egypt. On his return from Syria and Mesopotamia, the Egyptian pharaoh Necho II captured and deposed the Judean king Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah who had just succeeded his father on the throne. Necho enforced a tribute of 100 talents of silver (about 3 tons or about 3.4 metric tons) and a talent of gold (about ) upon the Judeans, and appointed Jehoahaz&#x27; older brother Eliakim as king; Necho also renamed Eliakim to Jehoiakim. Jehoahaz was taken as a captive to Egypt, where he became the first king of Judah to die in exile.

<text>Enos Thompson Throop ( ; August 21, 1784 – November 1, 1874) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat who was the tenth governor of New York from 1829 to 1832.

==Early life and career==
Throop was born in Johnstown, New York on August 21, 1784, the eldest child of George Bliss Throop and Abiah Thompson. It was a political family; two of his mother&#x27;s brothers, Israel Thompson and Jesse Thompson, served in the New York Assembly, his younger brother George B. Throop served in the state senate, and his half-sister Eliza married first U.S. Representative Gershom Powers and then U.S. Representative William B. Rochester. He studied law in Albany with attorney George Metcalfe, where he became friendly with his fellow student Martin Van Buren. His nephew and namesake, Enos Thompson Throop Martin, married Cornelia Williams Martin, a prominent philanthropist and social activist in Auburn, New York.

Throop was admitted to the bar in 1806, and began to practice law in Auburn, New York. He joined the Democratic-Republican Party, and was appointed postmaster of the village, and in 1811 county clerk of Cayuga County.

In 1814, he married Evelina Vredenburgh, who died in 1834; she was the daughter of William Vredenburgh, an early landholder and investor in the area. None of their children survived infancy. The same year he was elected to the 14th United States Congress as a supporter of the war measures of the administration. He took part in the debates upon the measures to which the close of the war and the prostration of public and private credit gave rise. He also supported and voted for the act changing the compensation of congressmen from six dollars a day to $1,800 per annum, a course which temporarily clouded his political fortunes. Popular dissatisfaction with his actions was such that he was defeated at the congressional elections of April 1816, and resigned his seat on June 4, 1816. In April 1823, he was appointed Judge of the Seventh Circuit and remained on the bench until 1828 when he resigned.

==Governor==
In 1828, he joined his friend Martin Van Buren&#x27;s ticket for the gubernatorial election as the Democratic-Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, a step that rendered it necessary for him to resign his judicial office. It was expected that Andrew Jackson would be elected president at the same election, in which event Van Buren would be made secretary of state and would, if his appointment were confirmed, have to resign the office of governor and the leadership of the party, and with Throop as his lieutenant would keep both offices in the hands of a friend. These expectations were fulfilled, and Throop succeeded to the office of governor on March 12, 1829. He was re-elected governor in 1830, defeating again Francis Granger, who had been the contender for the lieutenant-governorship at the previous election. At this time the construction of the Chenango Canal became one of the chief questions of state policy. He opposed the plan, raising such a vehement opposition to him in the localities through which the proposed canal would pass, that in 1832 he declined to seek a third term. The French observer of America Alexis de Tocqueville visited Throop on his farm near Auburn and was amazed to find that the governor engaged in farming half the year to supplement his small salary.

==Later life==

In 1833 he was appointed by President Jackson naval officer at the Port of New York, which office he held until February 6, 1838, when President Van Buren appointed him Chargé d&#x27;affaires of the United States to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. On this post he remained until January 12, 1842. After spending two years in Paris, he returned to the United States, and resided upon an estate on the banks of Owasco Lake near Auburn. In 1847 he moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he purchased a farm of , and became noted among agriculturists. Advancing years compelled him to give up farming, and in 1857 he returned to his former home, removing in 1868 to New York City, but a few years later again returning to his residence near Auburn.

He died on his estate of Willowbrook, near Auburn, on November 1, 1874, aged 90. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church (now Sts. Peter and St. John Church) in Auburn.

There is a memorial to him at the Cathedral of All Saints (Albany, New York) (&quot;see image on this page&quot;) that states in Latin, &quot;integer vitae scelerisque purus&quot;, which means &quot;upright of life and free from wickedness.&quot;

The Town of Throop, New York in Cayuga County is named after him.

Throop Avenue in Brooklyn (Kings County) and Throop Avenue in the Bronx are named after him.

<text>A convection oven (also known as a fan-assisted oven, turbo broiler or simply a fan oven or turbo) is an oven that has fans to circulate air around food to create an evenly heated environment. In an oven without a fan, natural convection circulates hot air unevenly, so that it will be cooler at the bottom and hotter at the top than in the middle. Fan ovens cook food faster, and are also used in non-food, industrial applications. Small countertop convection ovens for household use are often marketed as air fryers.

When cooking using a fan-assisted oven, the temperature is usually set lower than for a non-fan oven, often by , to avoid overcooking the outside of the food.

==Principle of operation==
Convection ovens distribute heat evenly around the food, removing the blanket of cooler air that surrounds food when it is first placed in an oven and allowing food to cook more evenly in less time and at a lower temperature than in a conventional oven.

== History ==
The first oven with a fan to circulate air was invented in 1914 but it was never launched commercially.

The first convection oven in wide use was the Maxson Whirlwind Oven, introduced in 1945.

Convection ovens have been in wide use since 1945.

In 2006, Groupe SEB introduced the world&#x27;s first air fryer, under the Actifry brand of convection ovens in the French market.

In 2010, Philips introduced the Airfryer brand of convection oven at the IFA Berlin consumer electronics fair. By 2018, the term &quot;air fryer&quot; was starting to be used generically.

In the United States convection ovens experienced a surge in popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s with a reported 36% of U.S. households having one in 2020 and an estimated 60% of U.S. households having one in 2023. Food manufacturers have responded by adding air frying instructions on a number of products and pre air-fried products also coming to market.

In the UK, air fryers have surged in popularity since the early 2020s, with a 2024 study claiming that 1 in 5 Britons surveyed said that air fryers are their most commonly used cooking device. 

== Design ==
A convection oven has a fan with a heating element around it. A small fan circulates the air in the cooking chamber.

One effect of the fan is to reduce the thickness of the stationary thermal boundary layer of cooler air that naturally forms around the food. The boundary layer acts as an insulator and slows the rate at which heat is transferred to the food. By moving the cool air (&quot;convecting&quot; it) away from the food the layer is thinned, and cooking is faster. To prevent overcooking before the middle is cooked, the temperature is usually reduced by about below the setting used for a non-fan oven. In a non-fan oven the temperature varies significantly in different places; a fan distributes hot air evenly for a uniform temperature.

Convection ovens may include additional radiant heat sources at the top and bottom of the oven, which provide immediate heat without the warmup time of a (natural or fan-assisted) convection oven.

== Effectiveness ==
A convection oven allows a reduction in cooking temperature compared to a conventional oven. This comparison will vary, depending on factors including, for example, how much food is being cooked at once or if airflow is being restricted, for example by an oversized baking tray. This difference in cooking temperature is offset as the circulating air transfers heat more quickly than still air of the same temperature. In order to transfer the same amount of heat in the same time, the temperature must be lowered to reduce the rate of heat transfer in order to compensate.

== Variants ==

Another form of convection oven has hot air directed at a high flow rate from above and below food that passes through the oven on a conveyor belt; it is called an impingement oven. This cooks, for example, breaded products such as chicken nuggets or breaded chicken portions faster than a fan oven, and yields a crisp surface texture. Impinged air also prevents &quot;shadowing&quot; which occurs with infrared radiant heat sources. Impingement ovens can achieve a much higher heat transfer than a conventional oven.

Fully enclosed models can also use dual magnetrons, as used by microwave ovens. The most notable manufacturer of this type of oven is TurboChef. The differences between an impingement oven with magnetrons and a convection microwave oven are claimed to be cost, power consumption, and speed. Impingement ovens are designed to be used in restaurants, where speed is essential and power consumption and cost are less of a concern.

There are also convection microwave ovens which combine a convection oven with a microwave oven to cook food with the speed of a microwave oven and the browning ability of a convection oven.

A combi steamer is an oven that combines convection functionality with superheated steam to cook foods even faster and retain more nutrients and moisture.

=== Air fryer ===
An air fryer is a small countertop convection oven that is said to simulate deep frying without submerging the food in oil. A fan circulates hot air at a high speed, producing a crisp layer via browning reactions such as the Maillard reaction. Some product reviewers find that regular convection ovens or convection toaster ovens produce better results; others say that air frying is essentially the same as convection baking, while still others praise the devices for cooking faster, being easier to clean, and making it easier to produce crispy results than full size convection ovens.

The original Philips Air fryer used radiant heat from a heating element just above the food and convection heat from a strong air stream flowing upwards through the open bottom of the food chamber, delivering heat from all sides, with a small volume of hot air forced to pass from the heater surface and over the food, with no idle air circulating as in a convection oven. A shaped guide directed the airflow over the bottom of the food. The technique was patented as Rapid Air technology.

Traditional frying methods induce the Maillard reaction at temperatures of by completely submerging foods in hot oil, well above the boiling point of water. The air fryer works by circulating air at up to to apply sufficient heat to food coated with a thin layer of oil, causing the reaction.

Most air fryers have temperature and timer adjustments that allow precise cooking. Food is typically cooked in a basket that sits on a drip tray. For best results the basket must be periodically agitated, either manually or by the fryer mechanism. Convection ovens and air fryers are similar in the way they cook food, but air fryers are smaller and give off less heat to the room.

There are several types of household air fryer:

;Paddle
In this type, a paddle machine moves throughout the heating chamber to move the air around more evenly. This is more convenient for the user because other types of air fryers require manual stirring throughout to ensure that all sides are fully cooked. 

;Cylindrical basket
A cylindrical basket is a small, single function air fryer that includes a drawer with a removable basket. A fan circulates from the top, and the food is cooked through holes in the basket. It can accommodate of food or less on average. Because of its compact size, it preheats faster than other types of air fryers.

;Countertop convection oven
Countertop convection ovens come with an air frying feature that work the same way as basket type air fryers. They usually have multiple trays or racks, so multiple things can be cooked at the same time. It holds of food on average. They are more versatile than single function type because they have multiple features like baking, rotisserie, grilling, frying, broiling, and toasting.

;Halogen
This type of air fryer cooks food with a halogen radiant heat source from above. The heat is spread evenly with a fan like other types of air fryers. This type is usually a large glass bowl with a hinged lid.

;Oil-less turkey fryer
This is a large, barrel-shaped air fryer used to cook whole turkeys and other large pieces of meat. It circulates air around the drum to cook the meat evenly.

==Industrial convection ovens==
Hot air ovens are convection ovens used to sterilize medical equipment.

<doc id="636036" wikidata="Q199371" url="?curid=636036" title="Battle of Megiddo (1918)">
<text>The Battle of Megiddo was fought between 19 and 25 September 1918, on the Plain of Sharon, in front of Tulkarm, Tabsor and Arara in the Judean Hills as well as on the Esdralon Plain at Nazareth, Afulah, Beisan, Jenin and Samakh. Its name, which has been described as &quot;perhaps misleading&quot; since very limited fighting took place near Tel Megiddo, was chosen by British commander Edmund Allenby for its biblical and symbolic resonance.

The battle was the final Allied offensive of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. The contending forces were the Allied Egyptian Expeditionary Force, of three corps including one of mounted troops, and the Ottoman Yildirim Army Group which numbered three armies, each the strength of barely an Allied corps. The series of battles took place in what was then the central and northern parts of Ottoman Palestine and parts of present-day Israel, Syria and Jordan. After forces of the Arab Revolt attacked the Ottoman lines of communication, distracting the Ottomans, British and Indian infantry divisions attacked and broke through the Ottoman defensive lines in the sector adjacent to the coast in the set-piece Battle of Sharon. The Desert Mounted Corps rode through the breach and almost encircled the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth armies still fighting in the Judean Hills. The subsidiary Battle of Nablus was fought virtually simultaneously in the Judean Hills in front of Nablus and at crossings of the Jordan River. The Ottoman Fourth Army was subsequently attacked in the Hills of Moab at Es Salt and Amman.

These battles resulted in many tens of thousands of prisoners and many miles of territory being captured by the Allies. Following the battles, Daraa was captured on 27 September, Damascus on 1 October and operations at Haritan, north of Aleppo, were still in progress when the Armistice of Mudros was signed ending hostilities between the Allies and Ottomans.

The operations of General Edmund Allenby, the British commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, achieved decisive results at comparatively little cost, in contrast to many offensives during the First World War. Allenby achieved this through the use of creeping barrages to cover set-piece infantry attacks to break a state of trench warfare and then use his mobile forces (cavalry, armoured cars and aircraft) to encircle the Ottoman armies&#x27; positions in the Judean Hills, cutting off their lines of retreat. The irregular forces of the Arab Revolt also played a part in this victory.

==Background==
The ancient fortress of Megiddo stands on Tell el-Mutesellim (Tel Megiddo), at the mouth of the Musmus Pass near al-Lajjun, controlling the routes to the north and the interior by dominating the Plain of Armageddon or of Megiddo. Across this plain several armies, from the ancient Egyptians to the French under Napoleon, had fought on their way towards Nazareth in the Galilean Hills. By 1918 this plain, known as the Plain of Esdraelon (the Jezreel Valley in Israeli terms) was still strategically important as it linked the Jordan Valley and the Plain of Sharon behind the Ottoman front line, and together, these three valleys formed a semicircle round the main Ottoman positions in the Judean Hills held by their Seventh and Eighth armies.

===Allied situation===
The Entente Powers had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914. In early 1915 and in August 1916 the Ottomans, with German commanders, aid and encouragement, had attacked the Suez Canal, a vital link between Britain and India, Australia and New Zealand. Under General Archibald Murray, the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) stopped the Ottoman army at the Battle of Romani and drove them back to Magdhaba and across the Sinai to Rafa to reoccupy Egyptian territory and secure the safety of the Suez Canal. Having constructed a railway and water pipeline across the desert, Murray then attacked southern Palestine. In the First Battle of Gaza and the Second Battle of Gaza in March and April 1917, the British attacks were defeated.

In 1916, the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule had broken out in the Hejaz, led by Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca. Although the Ottomans defended Medina, at the end of the Hejaz Railway against them, part of the Sherifian Army, led by Hussein&#x27;s son, the Emir Feisal, and British liaison officer T. E. Lawrence, extended the revolt northwards. Finally, Lawrence and bedouin tribesmen won the Battle of Aqaba in July 1917. The capture of the port of Aqaba allowed the Allies to supply Feisal&#x27;s forces and deprived the Ottomans of a position behind the right flank of the EEF.

General Allenby had been appointed to succeed Murray in command of the EEF, and was encouraged to renew the offensive. After receiving reinforcements, he broke through the Ottoman defences in the Third Battle of Gaza and defeated an Ottoman attempt to make a stand to the north at the Battle of Mughar Ridge. Despite Ottoman counter-attacks, the EEF captured Jerusalem in the second week in December 1917.

After a pause of several weeks caused by bad weather and the need to repair his lines of communication, Allenby advanced eastward to capture Jericho in February 1918. However, in March, the Germans launched their spring offensive on the Western Front, intending to defeat the Allied armies in France and Belgium. Allenby was ordered to send reinforcements (two complete divisions, another 24 infantry battalions from other divisions and nine dismounted yeomanry regiments) to the Western Front. Allenby&#x27;s tank force was also returned to France. In total approximately 60,000 officers and men were transferred to the Western Front in 1918.

However, Allenby maintained pressure on the Ottoman armies by twice sending mounted and infantry divisions across the Jordan. The first attack briefly cut the Hejaz Railway near Amman before the attackers retreated. In the second attack, Allenby&#x27;s troops captured Es Salt on the road to Amman, but fell back when their communications were threatened. Despite these failures, Allenby had established two bridgeheads across the Jordan north of the Dead Sea which were retained during the ensuing occupation of the southern Jordan Valley.

===Ottoman situation===
At the same time (effectively from 8 March 1918), the Ottoman command changed. The highest level Ottoman headquarters in Palestine was the Yıldırım Army Group. The army group had originally been formed to recapture Baghdad which had been captured by the British in March 1917. Instead, it had been diverted to Palestine where the British were close to capturing Jerusalem. The army group&#x27;s commander was the German general, Erich von Falkenhayn, who wished to continue a policy of &quot;yielding defence&quot; rather than hold all positions at all costs. He was also prepared to retreat to shorten his lines of communication and reduce the need for static garrisons. However, he was unpopular among Ottoman officers, mainly because he relied almost exclusively on German rather than Ottoman staff officers, and was blamed for the defeats at Gaza and Jerusalem. He was replaced by another German General, Otto Liman von Sanders, who had commanded the Ottoman defence during the Gallipoli Campaign. Liman reasoned that continued retreat in Palestine would demoralise the troops, ruin their draught animals, encourage the Arab Revolt to spread further north into the Ottoman rear areas and also lead to all the Ottoman forces to the south in the Hejaz being finally isolated. His forces halted their retreat and dug in to resist the British, even reoccupying some ground near the Jordan as Allenby&#x27;s two raids across the Jordan were repulsed.

Until late September 1918, the strategic situation of the Ottoman Empire appeared to be better than that of the other Central Powers. Their forces in Mesopotamia were holding their ground, while in the Caucasus they had captured Armenia, Azerbaijan and much of Georgia in an advance towards the Caspian Sea. Liman von Sanders was expected to repeat his defence of Gallipoli and defeat the British invasion in Palestine.

However, some other commanders were worried about an assault on their extended front in Palestine. They wished to pull their troops back, so an attack would have to cross undefended ground and lose any tactical surprise. However, Liman would have had to abandon what seemed to be good defences and he decided that it was too late to pull back.

===Allied reorganisation===
During the summer of 1918, Allenby&#x27;s forces were built back up to full strength. Two British Indian Army cavalry divisions, the 4th Cavalry Division and 5th Cavalry Division, arrived from the Western Front and were reorganised to include one British yeomanry regiment in five of their six brigades. Two Indian infantry divisions, the 3rd (Lahore) Division and the 7th (Meerut) Division, were transferred from the Mesopotamian Campaign to replace two divisions which had been sent to the Western Front. Four of Allenby&#x27;s infantry divisions (the 10th, 53rd, 60th and 75th) were reformed on the pattern of British Indian Army, with three Indian and one British infantry battalion in each brigade except one brigade in the 53rd Division which had one British, one South African and two Indian battalions. The remaining British infantry division, the 54th (East Anglian) Division, retained its all-British composition, although the brigade-sized Détachement Français de Palestine et de Syrie was attached to the division.

There was a comparative lull in activity while Allenby&#x27;s divisions were reorganised and retrained, but some local attacks were made, especially in the Judean Hills. On 19 July, the Ottomans and Germans mounted a brief attack at Abu Tellul near the Jordan, but were defeated by Australian Light Horse regiments with heavy casualties to the German 11th Reserve &quot;Jäger&quot; battalion, which was subsequently withdrawn from Palestine.

===Arab Northern Army===
As Allenby&#x27;s reorganisation proceeded, the Arab Northern Army (part of the Arab Revolt) was operating east of the Jordan under the overall leadership of the Emir Feisal. Feisal&#x27;s headquarters were at Aba el Lissan, about south-west of the Ottoman position at Ma&#x27;an, and his army received support from the British through the port of Aqaba. Assistance to Feisal included liaison officers, detachments of armoured cars, Indian machine gunners and a French Algerian mountain battery, 2,000 dromedary from three disbanded battalions of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, weapons, ammunition and above all, money (almost always in coin). In mid-1916, this had started as a monthly subsidy of £30,000. By the time Allenby launched his Megiddo offensive, it had grown to £220,000 a month.

The 2,000 regular soldiers of the Arab Northern Army maintained a blockade of the Ottoman garrison at Ma&#x27;an after an unsuccessful attack at Khirbet es-Samra earlier in the year. They were commanded by Jaafar Pasha, formerly an Ottoman officer who had been sent to lead a rebellion against the British by the Senussi in Egypt, but had joined the Arab Revolt after being captured. Most of these regulars were former Arab conscripts in the Ottoman Army who had deserted or, like Jaafar, had changed sides after becoming prisoners of war.

Meanwhile, Arab irregulars raided the Hejaz Railway from Aba-el-Lissan and Aqaba, often accompanied by Lawrence and other British liaison officers. In particular, in the weeks following the failure of Allenby&#x27;s second attack across the Jordan, they carried out demolitions on an stretch of line around Mudawwara, due east of Aqaba, effectively closing the line for a month and ending Ottoman operations around Medina at the end of the railway.

==Prelude==
===Allenby&#x27;s plan===
Allenby intended to break through the western end of the Ottoman line, where the terrain was favourable to cavalry operations. His horsemen would pass through the gap to seize objectives deep in the Ottoman rear areas and isolate their Seventh and Eighth Armies.

As a preliminary move, the Arab Northern Army would attack the railway junction at Daraa beginning on 16 September, to interrupt the Ottoman lines of communication and distract the Yildirim headquarters.

The two divisions of XX Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode, would make an attack in the Judean Hills beginning on the night of 18 September, partly to further distract Ottoman attention to the Jordan Valley sector, and partly to secure positions from which their line of retreat across the Jordan could be blocked. Once the main offensive by XXI Corps and the Desert Mounted Corps was launched, XX Corps was to block the Ottoman escape route from Nablus to the Jordan crossing at Jisr ed Damieh and if possible capture the Ottoman Seventh Army&#x27;s headquarters in Nablus.

The main breakthrough was to be achieved on the coast on 19 September by four infantry divisions of XXI Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin, massed on a front wide. The fifth division of XXI Corps (the 54th) was to make a subsidiary attack inland of the main breach. Once the breakthrough was achieved, the corps, with the 5th Light Horse Brigade attached, would advance to capture the headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm and the lateral railway line by which the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies were supplied, including the important railway junction at Messudieh.

The strategic move was to be made by the Desert Mounted Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel. Its three mounted divisions were massed behind the three westernmost infantry divisions of XXI Corps. As soon as XXI Corps had breached the Ottoman defences, they were to march north to reach the passes through the Carmel Range before Ottoman troops could forestall them, and pass through these to seize the communication centres of Al-Afuleh and Beisan. These two communication centres were within the radius of a strategic cavalry &quot;bound&quot;, the distance mounted units could cover before being forced to halt for rest and to obtain water and fodder for the horses. If they were captured, the lines of communication and retreat for all Ottoman troops west of the Jordan would be cut.

Finally, a detachment consisting of the Anzac Mounted Division, the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade, two battalions of the British West Indies Regiment, and two battalions of Jewish Volunteers in the Royal Fusiliers, amounting to 11,000 men commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor and known as Chaytor&#x27;s Force, was to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge and fords in a pincer movement. This important line of communication between the Ottoman Armies on the west bank of the Jordan with the Ottoman Fourth Army at Es Salt, was required by Allenby before Chaytor could proceed to capture Es Salt and Amman.

====Entente deceptions====
Secrecy was an essential part, as it had been at the Battle of Beersheba the preceding year. It was feared that the Ottomans could thwart the preparations for the attack by making a withdrawal in the coastal sector. Laborious efforts were therefore made to prevent the Ottomans discerning Allenby&#x27;s intentions and to persuade them that the next Entente attack would be made in the Jordan Valley. All westward movements of personnel and vehicles from the Jordan Valley towards the Mediterranean coast were made during the night while all movements eastwards were made during daytime. The detached Anzac Mounted Division in the Jordan Valley simulated the activity of the entire mounted corps. Troops marched openly down to the valley by day, and were secretly taken back by lorry at night to repeat the process the next day. Vehicles or mules dragged harrows along tracks to raise dust clouds, simulating other troop movements. Dummy camps and horse lines were constructed and a hotel in Jerusalem was ostentatiously commandeered for an Expeditionary Force headquarters.

Meanwhile, the 2nd (British) Battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps joined Arab irregulars in a raid east of the Jordan. They first captured and destroyed the railway station at Mudawara, finally cutting the Hejaz Railway, and then mounted a reconnaissance near Amman, scattering corned beef tins and documents as proof of their presence. Lawrence sent agents to openly buy up huge quantities of forage in the same area. As a final touch, British newspapers and messages were filled with reports of a race meeting to take place on 19 September, the day on which the attack was to be launched.

Though Allenby&#x27;s deceptions did not induce Liman to concentrate his forces against the River Jordan flank, Allenby was nevertheless able to concentrate a force superior to the Ottoman XXII Corps by nearly five to one in infantry and even more in artillery on the Mediterranean flank, where the main attack was to be made, undetected by the Ottomans. Earlier in the year (on 9 June), units of the 7th (Meerut) Division had captured two hills just inland from the coast, depriving the Ottomans of two important observation points overlooking the Allied bridgehead north of the Nahr-el-Auja. Also, the Royal Engineers had established a bridging school on the Nahr-al-Auja much earlier in the year, so the sudden appearance of several bridges across it on the eve of the assault did not alert any other Ottoman observers.

====Entente air superiority====

These various deceptions could not have been successful without the Entente forces&#x27; undisputed air supremacy west of the Jordan. The squadrons of the Royal Air Force and the Australian Flying Corps outnumbered and outclassed the Ottoman and German aircraft detachments in Palestine. During the weeks before the September attack, enemy aerial activity dropped markedly. Although during one week in June hostile aeroplanes crossed the British front lines 100 times, mainly on the tip–and–run principle at altitudes of , by the last week in August this number had dropped to 18 and during the three following weeks of September it was reduced to just four enemy aircraft. During the 18 days before the start of the battle, only two or three German aircraft were seen flying. Eventually, Ottoman and German reconnaissance aircraft could not even take off without being engaged by British or Australian fighters, and could therefore not see through Allenby&#x27;s deceptions, nor spot the true Allied concentration which was concealed in orange groves and plantations.

===Ottoman dispositions===
Under the Yildirim Army Group were, from west to east: the Eighth Army (Jevad Pasha) which held the front from the Mediterranean coast to the Judean Hills with five divisions (one of which had recently arrived at Et Tire, a few miles behind the front lines), a cavalry division and the German &quot;Pasha II&quot; detachment, equivalent to a regiment; the Seventh Army (Mustafa Kemal Pasha) which held the front in the Judean Hills to the Jordan River with four divisions and a German regiment; and the Fourth Army (Jemal Mersinli Pasha), which was divided into two groups: one faced the bridgeheads which Allenby&#x27;s forces had seized over the Jordan with two divisions, while the other defended Amman and Ma&#x27;an and the Hejaz Railway against attacks by Arab forces with two divisions, a cavalry division and some miscellaneous detachments.

In August 1918, the Yildirim Army Group&#x27;s front-line strength was 40,598 infantrymen armed with 19,819 rifles, 273 light and 696 heavy machine guns, and 402 guns.

Although the Ottomans had fairly accurately estimated the total Allied strength, Liman lacked intelligence on the Allied plans and dispositions and was forced to dispose his forces evenly along the entire length of his front. Moreover, almost his entire fighting strength was in the front line. The armies&#x27; only operational reserves were the two German regiments and the two understrength cavalry divisions. Further back there were no strategic reserves other than some &quot;Depot Regiments&quot;, not organised as fighting units, and scattered garrisons and line of communication units.

After four years of warfare, most Ottoman units were understrength and demoralised by desertions, sickness and shortage of supplies (although supplies were not short at Damascus when Desert Mounted Corps arrived there on 1 October 1918. It was possible to find food and forage for three cavalry divisions; 20,000 men and horses &quot;without depriving the inhabitants of essential food.&quot;). Liman nevertheless relied on the determination of the Turkish infantry and the strength of their front-line fortifications. Although the numbers of artillery pieces and especially of machine guns among the defenders were unusually high, the Ottoman lines had only thin belts of barbed wire compared with those on the Western Front, and Liman was unable to take into account the improved British tactical methods in set-piece offensives, involving surprise and short but accurate artillery preparation based on aerial reconnaissance.

==Battle==

===Opening attacks===
On 16 September 1918, Arabs under T. E. Lawrence and Nuri as-Said began destroying railway lines around the vital rail centre of Daraa, at the junction of the Hedjaz Railway which supplied the Ottoman army at Amman and the Palestine Railway which supplied the Ottoman armies in Palestine. Lawrence&#x27;s initial forces (a Camel Corps unit from Feisal&#x27;s Army, an Egyptian Camel Corps unit, some Gurkha machine gunners, British and Australian armoured cars and French mountain artillery) were soon joined by up to 3,000 Ruwallah and Howeitat tribesmen under noted fighting chiefs such as Auda abu Tayi and Nuri al-Shaalan. Although Lawrence was ordered by Allenby only to disrupt communications around Daraa for a week and Lawrence himself had not intended a major uprising to take place in the area immediately, to avoid Ottoman reprisals, a growing number of local communities spontaneously took up arms against the Turks.

As the Ottomans reacted, sending the garrison of Al-Afuleh to reinforce Daraa, the units of Chetwode&#x27;s Corps made attacks in the hills above the Jordan on 17 and 18 September. The 53rd Division attempted to seize ground commanding the road system behind the Ottoman front lines. Some objectives were captured but a position known to the British as &quot;Nairn Ridge&quot; was defended by the Ottomans until late on 19 September. Once it was captured, roads could be constructed to link the British road systems with those newly captured.

At the last minute, an Indian deserter had warned the Turks about the impending main attack. Refet Bey, the commander of the Ottoman XXII Corps on the Eighth Army&#x27;s right flank, wished to withdraw to forestall the attack but his superiors Jevad Pasha, commanding the Ottoman Eighth Army, and Liman (who feared that the deserter was himself an attempted intelligence bluff) forbade him to do so.
At 1:00 am on 19 September, the RAF Palestine Brigade&#x27;s single Handley Page O/400 heavy bomber dropped its full load of sixteen bombs on the main telephone exchange and railway station in Al-Afuleh. This cut communications between Liman&#x27;s headquarters at Nazareth and Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies for the following vital two days, dislocating the Ottoman command. DH.9s of No. 144 Squadron also bombed El Afule telephone exchange and railway station, Messudieh railway junction and the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters and telephone exchange at Nablus.

===Breakthrough of Ottoman line===

At 4:30 am, Allenby&#x27;s main attack by XXI Corps opened. A barrage by 385 guns (the field artillery of five divisions, five batteries of 60-pounder guns, thirteen siege batteries of medium howitzers and seven batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery), 60 trench mortars and two destroyers off the coast fell on the Ottoman 7th and 20th Divisions&#x27; front-line positions defending Nahr el Faliq. As the opening bombardment turned to a &quot;lifting&quot; barrage at 4:50 am, the British and Indian infantry advanced and quickly broke through the Ottoman lines. Within hours, the Desert Mounted Corps were moving north along the coast, with no Ottoman reserves available to check them.

According to Woodward, &quot;concentration, surprise, and speed were key elements in the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; warfare planned by Allenby&quot;. By the end of the first day of battle, the left flank unit of the British XXI Corps (the 60th Division) had reached Tulkarm and the remnants of the Ottoman Eighth Army were in disorderly retreat under air attack by Bristol F.2 Fighters of No. 1 Australian Squadron, through the defile at Messudieh and into the hills to the east, covered by a few rearguards hastily organised by the German Asia Korps headquarters and its commander, Oberst Gustav von Oppen. The headquarters of the Ottoman XXII Corps had been overrun and captured, although Refet Bey, the corps commander, escaped. Jevad Pasha, the army commander, had fled, and Mustafa Kemal Pasha at Seventh Army headquarters was unable to re-establish control over Eighth Army&#x27;s troops.

Throughout the day, the RAF prevented any of the German aircraft based at Jenin from taking off and interfering with the British land operations. Relays of two S.E.5s from Nos. 111 and 145 Squadrons, armed with bombs, circled over the German airfield at Jenin all day on 19 September. Whenever they spotted any movement on the ground, they bombed the airfield. Each pair of aircraft were relieved every two hours, machine-gunning the German hangars before departing.

===Encirclement of two Ottoman Armies===
During the early hours of 20 September 1918, the Desert Mounted Corps secured the defiles of the Carmel Range. The 4th Mounted Division passed through these to capture Afulah and Beisan, complete with the bulk of two depot regiments. A brigade of the 5th Mounted Division attacked Nazareth, where Liman von Sanders&#x27;s HQ was situated, although Liman himself escaped. In the late afternoon a brigade from the Australian Mounted Division occupied Jenin, capturing thousands of retreating Ottomans. The 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, of the 5th Mounted Division, captured the port of Haifa on 23 September.

Once nothing stood between Allenby&#x27;s forces and Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s Seventh Army in Nablus, Kemal decided that he lacked sufficient men to fight the British forces. With the railway blocked, the Seventh Army&#x27;s only escape route lay to the east, along the Nablus-Beisan road that led down the Wadi Fara into the Jordan valley.

On the night of 20–21 September the Seventh Army began to evacuate Nablus. By this time it was the last formed Ottoman army west of the Jordan and although there was a chance that Chetwode&#x27;s XX Corps might cut off their retreat, its advance had been slowed by Ottoman rearguards. On 21 September, the Seventh Army was spotted by aircraft in a defile west of the river. The RAF proceeded to bomb the retreating army and destroyed the entire column. Waves of bombing and strafing aircraft passed over the column every three minutes and although the operation had been intended to last for five hours, the Seventh Army was routed in 60 minutes. The wreckage of the destroyed column stretched over . British cavalry later found 87 guns, 55 motor-lorries, 4 motor-cars, 75 carts, 837 four-wheeled wagons, and scores of water-carts and field-kitchens destroyed or abandoned on the road. Many Ottoman soldiers were killed and the survivors were scattered and leaderless. Lawrence later wrote that &quot;the RAF lost four killed. The Turks lost a corps.&quot;

According to Chauvel&#x27;s biographer, Allenby&#x27;s plan for the Battle of Megiddo was as &quot;brilliant in execution as it had been in conception; it had no parallel in France or on any other front, but rather looked forward in principle and even in detail to the Blitzkrieg of 1939.&quot; Over the next four days, the 4th Cavalry Division and Australian Mounted Division rounded up large numbers of demoralised and disorganised Ottoman troops in the Jezreel Valley. Many of the surviving refugees who crossed the Jordan were attacked and captured by Arabs as they approached or tried to bypass Daraa.
Liman deployed a rearguard to hold Samakh, on the Sea of Galilee. This town was to be the centre of a line stretching from Lake Hula to Daraa. A charge by one and a half Australian Light Horse regiments before dawn on 25 September, followed by intense hand-to-hand fighting, eventually captured the town. This victory broke the proposed defensive line and ended the Battle of Sharon.

===Judean Hills fighting===

As the Desert Mounted Corps and XXI Corps achieved their objectives, the units of XX Corps resumed their advance. Nablus was captured about noon on 21 September by the 10th Division and the Australian 5th Light Horse Brigade from XXI Corps. The British 53rd Division halted its advance towards the Wadi el Fara road when it became clear that the retreating Ottomans had effectively been destroyed by aerial attacks.
===Later operations around Daraa===

German and Ottoman aircraft had continued to operate from Daraa, harassing the Arab irregulars and insurgents still attacking railways and isolated Ottoman detachments about the town. At Lawrence&#x27;s urging, British aircraft began operating from makeshift landing strips at Um el Surab nearby from 22 September. Three Bristol F.2 Fighters shot down several of the Ottoman aircraft. The Handley Page 0/400 ferried across petrol, ammunition and spares for the fighters and two Airco DH.9s, and itself bombed the airfield at Daraa early on 23 September and nearby Mafraq on the following night.

===Capture of Amman===

On 22 September, on the western side of the Jordan River, the Ottoman 53rd Division was attacked at its headquarters near the Wadi el Fara road, by units from Meldrum&#x27;s Force. This force consisted of the New Zealand Mounted Brigade (commanded by Brigadier General W. Meldrum), the Machine Gun Squadron, the mounted sections of the 1st and 2nd British West Indies Regiment, the 29th Indian Mountain Battery and Ayrshire (or Inverness) Battery RHA. Meldrum&#x27;s force captured the commander of the 53rd Division, its headquarters and 600 prisoners, before defeating determined Ottoman rearguards to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge.

The Ottoman Fourth Army had remained in its positions until 21 September, apparently unaware of the destruction of the Ottoman armies west of the Jordan until refugees reached them. That day, Liman ordered the Fourth Army to retreat to Daraa and Irbid, about to the west. The Fourth Army began to retreat from the Jordan and Amman on 22 September in increasing disorder due to attacks by British and Australian aircraft on 23 September which caused heavy casualties to the retreating troops on the roads between Es Salt and Amman. On the same day, Chaytor&#x27;s Force advanced across the Jordan River to capture Es Salt.

On 25 September the Ottoman troops who had reached Mafraq by train from Amman, but who could proceed no further because the railway ahead was demolished, came under heavy aerial attack which caused many casualties and much disorder. Many Ottoman soldiers fled into the desert but several thousand maintained some order and, having abandoned their wheeled transport, continued to retreat northwards towards Daraa on foot or horseback, under constant air attack.

Chaytor&#x27;s Force captured Amman on 25 September. The Ottoman detachment from Ma&#x27;an, also trying to retreat northwards, found its line of retreat blocked at Ziza, south of Amman, and surrendered intact to the Anzac Mounted Division on 28 September, rather than risk slaughter by Arab irregulars.

==Aftermath==
===Capture of Damascus===
Allenby now ordered his cavalry to cross the Jordan, to capture Daraa and Damascus. Meanwhile, the 3rd (Lahore) Division advanced north along the coast towards Beirut and the 7th (Meerut) Division advanced on Baalbek in the Beqaa Valley, where the rearmost Ottoman depots and reinforcement camps were situated.

On 27 September, the 4th Mounted Division moved to Daraa, which had already been abandoned to Arab forces, and then advanced north on Damascus in company with them. The retreating Ottomans committed several atrocities against hostile Arab villages; in return, the Arab forces took no prisoners. Almost an entire Ottoman brigade (along with some German and Austrians) was massacred near the village of Tafas on 27 September, with the commander Jemal Pasha narrowly escaping. The Arabs repeated the performance the next day, losing a few hundred casualties while wiping out nearly 5,000 Turks in these two battles.

The 5th Mounted and Australian Mounted Divisions advanced directly across the Golan Heights towards Damascus. They fought actions at Benat Yakup, Kuneitra, Sasa and Katana, before they reached and closed the north and north-west exits from Damascus on 29 September. On 30 September, the Australians intercepted the garrison of Damascus as they tried to retreat through the Barada gorge. Damascus was captured the next day, with the Allies capturing 20,000 prisoners. Jemal Pasha fled, having failed to inspire last-ditch resistance.

Overall, the campaign to the fall of Damascus resulted in the surrender of 75,000 Ottoman soldiers.

===Pursuit to Aleppo===
After the fall of Damascus, the 5th Mounted Division and some detachments of the Arab Northern Army advanced north through Syria, capturing Aleppo on 26 October. They subsequently advanced to Mouslimmiye, where Mustafa Kemal (who had replaced Liman von Sanders in command of the Yıldırım Army Group) had rallied some troops under XXII Corps HQ. Kemal held his positions until 31 October, when hostilities ceased following the signing of the Armistice of Mudros.

===Effects===
The successful action at Megiddo resulted in the battle honour &quot;Megiddo&quot; being awarded to units of the British, Dominion and Empire forces participating in the battle. Battle honours for the two subsidiary battles of Sharon and Nablus were also awarded.

Edward Erickson, a historian of the Ottoman Army, later wrote:
The Battle of the Nablus Plain ranks with Ludendorff&#x27;s Black Days of the German Army in the effect that it had on the consciousness of the Turkish General Staff. It was now apparent to all but the most diehard nationalists that the Turks were finished in the war. In spite of the great victories in Armenia and in Azerbaijan, Turkey was now in an indefensible condition, which could not be remedied with the resources on hand. It was also apparent that the disintegration of the Bulgarian Army at Salonika and the dissolution of the Austro–Hungarian Army spelled disaster and defeat for the Central Powers. From now until the Armistice, the focus of the Turkish strategy would be to retain as much Ottoman territory as possible.

The battle is commemorated in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s poem &quot;Jezreel: on its Seizure by the English under Allenby, September 1918&quot;.

<doc id="636039" wikidata="Q1059040" url="?curid=636039" title="Savo Island">
<text>Savo Island is an island in Solomon Islands in the South Pacific ocean. Administratively, Savo Island is a part of the Central Province of Solomon Islands. It is about from the national capital of Honiara. The principal village is Alialia, in the north of the island.

The indigenous language of Savo is the Savosavo language, an East Papuan language. Savo Island also has a minority of Gela speakers.

The waters surrounding the island were the site of five of the seven major naval battles during the Battle of Guadalcanal in the Pacific War of World War II. As a result of these battles, many shipwrecks are located southeast of the island; the bay is known as Ironbottom Sound. The wrecks near the coast are very popular with wreck divers.

==Geography==
Savo is approximately circular, measuring approximately by . It is located northeast of Cape Esperance, the northern tip of Guadalcanal. The highest elevation is a stratovolcano, which last erupted between 1835 and 1847. The eruption was so strong that it wiped out all life on the island. An older eruption occurred in 1568. According to the World Organization of Volcanic Observatories (WOVO), the volcano is active every 100 to 300 years. On the island are geysers, hot mud lakes and hot springs.

===The &quot;egg fields&quot;===
Savo Island is known for the &quot;egg fields&quot; of the megapode, a bird which lays its eggs here and buries them in the warm sand to incubate. The eggs are excavated by local people and are considered a local food specialty. The eggs are slightly larger than a duck egg and are used for preparing omelettes and other dishes.

==History==
===European discovery and exploration===
The first recorded sighting of Savo Island by European explorers was by the Spanish expedition of Álvaro de Mendaña in April 1568. More precisely the sighting was due to a local exploration voyage done by a small boat, in the accounts the brigantine, commanded by &quot;maestre de campo&quot; Pedro de Ortega Valencia and having Hernán Gallego as pilot. They charted the volcanic island as &quot;Sesarga&quot;. Considering the expedition leaders Mendaña and cosmographer Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa were both from Galicia in Spain, it was probably so named after the island of the same name in this region.

On 15 March 1893, Savo Island was declared part of the British Solomon Islands protectorate. The island was occupied by the Empire of Japan in the early stages of the Pacific War.

===World War II===
Because of its proximity to Guadalcanal Island and the hotly contested nature of the battles for control of the Solomon Islands, Savo Island figured in many of the naval engagements of the Solomon Islands campaign. It is most well known as the location of several naval battles fought in the adjacent &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot; during World War II, between the Allied naval forces and the Imperial Japanese Navy.
List of World War II naval battles fought in the vicinity of Savo Island:
* Battle of Savo Island, 8-9 August 1942
* Battle of Cape Esperance (originally known as the &quot;Second Battle of Savo Island&quot;), 11–12 October 1942
* Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13–15 November 1942
* Battle of Tassafaronga, 30 November 1942

Since 1978, the island has been part of the independent state of Solomon Islands.

<doc id="636043" wikidata="Q881033" url="?curid=636043" title="William C. Bouck">
<text>William Christian Bouck (January 7, 1786 – April 19, 1859) was an American politician from New York. He was the thirteenth Governor of New York, from 1843 to 1844.

A native of Fultonham, New York, Bouck was educated in the local schools while working on his family&#x27;s farm and became a farmer himself. Originally a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and later a Democrat, he began a government and politics career with election as town clerk of Fulton (1807–1808), town supervisor (1808–1809) and sheriff of Schoharie County (1812–1813). Bouck served in the militia from 1809 to 1822 and rose through the ranks to become commander of New York&#x27;s 18th Regiment with the rank of colonel.

As Bouck&#x27;s career progressed, he served in the New York State Assembly (1814–1816, 1817–1818) and New York State Senate (1821–1822). From 1821 to 1840, Bouck served on the Erie Canal Commission, and during his long tenure, he oversaw construction of the western portion of the canal and several branch canals.

In 1842, Bouck was elected governor, and he served from 1843 to 1844. His term was largely occupied with responding to the Anti-Rent War, and he was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1844. After leaving office, Bouck served on the state Board of Regents (1845 to 1847) and from 1846 to 1849 was Assistant Treasurer of the United States at the New York City sub-treasury.

Bouck died in Fulton, New York, on April 19, 1859. He was buried at Middleburgh Cemetery in Middleburgh, New York.

==Early life==
Bouck was born in Fultonham, New York, on January 7, 1786, a son of Christian Bouck (1753–1836) and Margaret (Borst) Bouck (1762–1806). His siblings included Joseph Bouck, who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He was raised on his father&#x27;s farm and educated in the local schools of Schoharie County. Bouck became a farmer and began a long career in government and public service in 1807, when he was elected as Fulton&#x27;s town clerk. From 1808 to 1809, Bouck was Fulton&#x27;s town supervisor. He served as Sheriff of Schoharie County from 1812 to 1813.

==Military service==
In 1809 Bouck was appointed adjutant of the New York Militia&#x27;s 18th Regiment, a post he held until he was appointed sheriff. Bouck continued his service in the militia; he was appointed quartermaster of the 28th Brigade in 1815. In 1817, he was promoted to major in the 113th Regiment. Later in 1817, Bouck was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the 28th Brigade. From 1819 to 1822, Bouck commanded the 18th Regiment with the rank of colonel.

==Continued career==
As a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, Bouck served in the New York State Assembly from 1813 to 1816 and again from 1817 to 1818. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1821 to 1822. From 1821 to 1840, he was a member of the Erie Canal Commission, first selected to fill a newly created seat. When the Federalist Party became dormant and the Democratic-Republican followers of Andrew Jackson began calling themselves Democrats, Bouck became a leader of the Albany Regency, the clique led by Martin Van Buren which dominated New York state&#x27;s Democratic Party.

==Erie Canal Commissioner==
While serving as a canal commissioner, Bouck developed a strong reputation for both competence and integrity. During the nineteen years he served on the commission, he oversaw construction of the Erie Canal west of the Genesee River. In addition, he supervised design and building of several branch canals connected to the Erie, including the Cayuga, Seneca, Crooked Lake, Chemung and Chenango Canals. The canal projects overseen by Bouck required the expenditure of more than $8 million in state funds (more than $243 million in 2019), all of which he was able to account for during audits of his work.

During his service as a canal commissioner, Bouck frequently carried large sums of cash from Albany in order to pay construction crews in western New York. Both well-known and highly visible as he traveled alone on his favorite mount, he earned the nickname &quot;White Horse Bouck&quot;, and was held in such great esteem that he was never accosted or robbed. When the Whig Party came to power in New York in 1840, Bouck was so strongly identified with the Erie Canal that he could have obtained reappointment to the commission despite his party affiliation if he had desired it.

==Governor of New York==

During the New York Democratic Party&#x27;s factional dispute between the Barnburners and Hunkers, Bouck was identified with the conservative Hunker faction, causing him to fall out with President Martin Van Buren, who was the leader of the Barnburners. In November 1840, Bouck was the Democratic nominee for governor and Daniel S. Dickinson the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, and they were defeated by the Whig incumbents, William H. Seward and Luther Bradish.

In November 1842, Bouck and Dickinson ran again. They won the November general election by defeating Whig candidates Bradish for governor and Gabriel Furman for lieutenant governor. Bouck&#x27;s term was occupied primarily with the state&#x27;s response to the Anti-Rent War. Tenants who held perpetual leases under the patroon system first implemented when New York was a Dutch colony objected to the &quot;quarter sale&quot; provision of their leases. Under this provision if a tenant sold his lease, he had to pay his patroon one quarter of the sale price or one additional year&#x27;s rent. In addition, while the wealthiest patroon, Stephen Van Rensselaer, had generally proved a benevolent landlord usually willing to accept partial or late payments rather than evict tenants who fell behind on their rent, after his death in 1839 his heirs attempted to collect long-overdue payments. When the tenants could not pay and could not negotiate for favorable repayment terms, they were threatened with eviction and a revolt ensued. Bouck was sympathetic to the tenants, but as part of the effort to restore order during a violent demonstration, near the end of his term he sent units of the state militia to Hudson, which was viewed unfavorably by the tenants and their supporters.

In 1844, the Democratic Party desired to nominate a candidate who would consistently enforce the law against the rioters. Rather than renominate Bouck, they nominated Silas Wright, who won the general election. During his term, Wright also used the militia to restore order, and in 1846 he was defeated for a second term by Whig nominee John Young, who had taken the side of the tenants.

==Later career==
After completing his term as governor, Bouck served as a delegate to the 1846 state constitutional convention. He served as a member of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York from 1845 to 1847. From 1846 to 1849 he served as Assistant United States Treasurer in New York City.

==Death and burial==
In retirement, Bouck was a resident of Bouck&#x27;s Island, his family&#x27;s Boucks Island farm on the Schoharie Creek in Fulton. He died at his Bouck&#x27;s Island home on April 19, 1859 and was buried at Middleburgh Cemetery in Middleburgh.

==Family==
In 1807, Bouck married Catherine Lawyer (1787–1865). They were the parents of 13 children, including:
*James Madison (1808–1865)
*Joseph William (1809–1886)
*Margaret (1811–1837)
*Ann (1813–1890), the wife of Lyman Sanford
*Christina (1818–1836)
*Christian (1818–1909)
*Catherine (1820–1899), the wife of Erskine Danforth
*Caroline (1822–1913), the wife of Dr. Volney Danforth
*Elizabeth (1825–1826)
*Phillip (1822–1895)
*Gabriel (1828–1904)
*Charles (1829–1910)
*Nelson

Gabriel Bouck commanded the 18th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. He later served as Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Attorney General of Wisconsin and a member of the U.S. House from Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district.

==Legacy==
The hamlet of Bouckville in the town of Madison, New York, is named for Bouck. Bouck Hall, the student activities building at the State University of New York at Cobleskill is also named after him. Bouck&#x27;s Island, the Bouck family farm and home, is a New York State Historic Site.

<text>Lina Solomonovna Stern or Shtern (; 26 August 1878 – 7 March 1968) was a Soviet biochemist, physiologist and humanist whose medical discoveries saved thousands of lives at the fronts of World War II. She is best known for her pioneering work on the blood–brain barrier, which she described as &quot;hemato-encephalic barrier&quot; in 1921.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
On August 26, 1878, Lina Stern was born in Liepāja (today Liepāja, Latvia), the largest city in the Courland Region situated in western Latvia (Other sources noted she was born in Vilijampole district of Kaunas in 1875 and studied in Liepāja at high school). She was from wealthy large Jewish family. In 1898, Stern studied at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. However, before going to Switzerland, she tried to gain admission to Moscow University. Due to her Jewish background, it was very difficult for her to gain admission into Russian Universities, which is why she had to study abroad instead. Stern became friends with wives of Georgi Plekhanov and Aleksei Bach in Switzerland.

=== Career ===
In 1903, she wrote her doctoral dissertation on motor function of the urethra and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Despite the fact that Switzerland was more liberal than other European countries, Stern still had no professional prospects there. She returned to her Liepāja. There, she passed the exams to get her Doctor of Medicine degree in Russia. The reason she did this was because the policies at the time did not view a certificate from a foreign university to be acceptable. She was preparing to search for a medical job in Russia, but Jean-Louis Prévost (the head of the Department of Physiology at the University of Geneva) invited her to work as his assistant at the department. She accepted his invitation.

From 1904 to 1922, Stern worked with Frédéric Battelli to conduct original research into chemio-physiology. During that time period, they published 54 articles on the problem of cellular metabolism. In 1912, Battelli and Stern, along with Torsten Thunberg, “discovered that minced animal tissues contain substances that can transfer hydrogen atoms from specific intracellular organic acids to methylene blue dye, reducing it to a colorless form.” Their research was later on able to help Hans Krebs (biochemist) and his groundbreaking work on cellular respiration

Due to her groundbreaking research and hard work, the University of Geneva allowed her to add Physiological Chemistry as an independent field of study to the curriculum of the medical faculty. In 1918, a new department of Physiological Chemistry was established, and Lina Stern became the head of it. This mades her the first ever woman to be awarded professional rank at the University of Geneva.

It was from there that her research into the physiology of the central nervous system began – partly influenced by her friendship with Constantin von Monakow. Initially, Giuseppe Pagano, Professor of Chemical Physiology at the Medical School of University of Palermo, started experimenting on animals to learn more about motor response and the cerebellum. “Stern and her associate E. Rothlin replicated Pagano&#x27;s experiment using more accurate methods.” This was the start of Stern’s lifelong research into the cerebrospinal fluid. Her research led her to groundbreaking conclusions about the blood-brain barrier.

&quot;In April 21, 1921, Stern introduced the term “blood-brain barrier” at the Medical Society of Geneva”. At that time, she was already well known in the world of academic science. However, she also worked as a consultant for several pharmaceutical companies.

After Stern receives an invitation to head the chair of physiology at the Second Moscow State University in 1924, she accepts and arrives in Moscow on March 31, 1925. She was 48 years old in 1925. Her entire life was devoted to science, and she accomplished quite a lot in her first three years as the chair of the department. On April 1, 1929, a new Institute of physiology was opened in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, and Stern became the director. She was very active in the scientific community and well-known amongst her colleagues. In 1939, she became the first female full member, academician, of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. In 1943 she won the Stalin Prize.

=== Defeat of the Anti-Fascist Committee ===
She was accused of cosmopolitanism and admiration for the West by the Soviet government in 1948. Her Institute in Moscow was closed. Stern was arrested in 1949 by Ministry of State Security (MGB) and interrogated by the head of MGB Viktor Abakumov.

Soviet government decided to eradicate Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) in the late 1940s as anti-Soviet organization. A member of the Antifascist Committee of Soviet Women and the JAC since the outbreak of World War II, Stern was the sole survivor out of 15 arrested and convicted to death sentence when the JAC was eradicated in January 1949. Her death sentence was changed to a prison term by Joseph Stalin, followed by five-year exile. The exile was in Dzhambul (current Taraz), Kazakhstan.

=== Life after exile ===
After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, life became easier. She returned from exile to Moscow. Stern continued to research for blood–brain barrier. Finally, she was exonerated by the Presidium in 1958. She headed the Department of Physiology at the Biophysics Institute between 1954 and 1968.

Lina Stern died on March 7, 1968.

== Research on the blood–brain barrier ==
The blood–brain barrier refers to a diffusion barrier formed by the endothelial walls of the blood vessels and capillaries in the brain. This barrier prevents most substances in the blood from entering the brain while allowing small molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse freely. While working at the University of Geneva, Stern published a series of studies demonstrating the existence of the blood-brain barrier with colleague Raymond Gautier. Beginning in 1918, the two performed systematic experiments on the movement of various substances from the blood into the nervous system and estimated the extent to which these substances were able to permeate the brain. From these studies they were able to conclude that there exists a barrier between the blood and brain, which they termed in French &quot;barrière hématoencéphalique&quot;. In a 1934 paper, Stern also independently introduced the notions of barrier selectivity and barrier resistance, realizing that the blood–brain barrier both selectively allows certain substances to enter the brain and protects the internal milieu of the brain from that of the blood. Today these are acknowledged as two of the main functions of the blood–brain barrier.

<text>Silas Wright Jr. (May 24, 1795 – August 27, 1847) was an American attorney and Democratic politician. A member of the Albany Regency, he served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, New York State Comptroller, United States Senator, and the fourteenth Governor of New York.

Born in Amherst, Massachusetts and raised in Weybridge, Vermont, Wright graduated from Middlebury College in 1815, studied law, attained admission to the bar, and began a practice in Canton, New York. He soon began a career in politics and government, serving as St. Lawrence County&#x27;s surrogate judge, a member of the New York State Senate, and a brigadier general in the state militia.

Wright became a member of the Albany Regency, the coterie of friends and supporters of Martin Van Buren who led New York&#x27;s Democratic Party beginning in the 1820s. As his career progressed, he served in the United States House of Representatives (1827–1829), as State Comptroller (1829–1833), and U.S. Senator (1833–1844). In the Senate, Wright became chairman of the Finance Committee, a post he held from 1836 to 1841. In 1844, Van Buren lost the Democratic presidential nomination to James K. Polk; Polk supporters nominated Wright for vice president as a way to attract Van Buren&#x27;s support to the ticket, but Wright declined. Later that year he was elected governor, and he served one two-year term. Defeated for reelection in 1846, he retired to his home in Canton. He died in Canton in 1847, and was buried at Old Canton Cemetery.

==Early life==
Wright was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, one of nine children born to tanner and shoemaker Captain Silas Wright (1760–1843) and Eleanor (Goodale) Wright (1762–1846). The family moved to Weybridge, Vermont in 1796, where they operated a farm on the banks of the Otter Creek. The elder Silas Wright commanded a company of militia during the War of 1812 and took part in the Battle of Plattsburgh. In addition, he was an early adherent of the Democratic-Republican Party, and served in local offices including member of the Vermont House of Representatives. The younger Silas Wright was educated in the public schools of Addison County and at Middlebury Academy.

Wright was an exceptional student, and received his teaching credentials when he was thirteen. He taught school in Rutland and Addison Counties from 1808 to 1810 while preparing to attend college. In 1811 he began attendance at Middlebury College. Following his graduation with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1815, Wright moved to Sandy Hill, New York to study law, first at the law firm headed by Henry C. Martindale, and then with the firm of Roger Skinner, with whom he formed a close friendship that lasted until Skinner&#x27;s death. Through Skinner, Wright became acquainted with Martin Van Buren and other members of the group known as the Albany Regency, which came to dominate the Democratic Party in New York. Wright was admitted to the bar in 1819 and began to travel through upstate New York looking for a place to establish himself in a legal career.

==Start of career==
Upon arriving in Canton, Wright met Medad Moody, a family friend from Weybridge who persuaded him to settle there. Wright began a law practice and was soon involved in politics as a Democratic-Republican, and served in local offices including justice of the peace, overseer of roads, town clerk, and school inspector. For several years he served as Canton&#x27;s postmaster. He was surrogate of St. Lawrence County from 1821 to 1824.

==Military service==
In 1822, several of Canton&#x27;s young men formed a militia company, which they elected Wright to lead with the rank of captain. When his company was grouped with several others to form the 7th Regiment in 1825, Wright was appointed commander with the rank of major. In 1826 he was promoted to colonel. In 1827 his regiment was organized as part of the militia&#x27;s 49th Brigade, 12th Division and the brigade&#x27;s officers unanimously elected him as commander, which resulted in his promotion to brigadier general. Wright resigned in 1829, when his assumption of the New York State Comptroller&#x27;s post required him to spend the majority of his time in Albany.

==State senator==
In 1823, the Democratic-Republican county convention in St. Lawrence County nominated Wright for the New York State Senate. The convention was dominated by supporters of Governor DeWitt Clinton and Wright was known to be a member of the Bucktails faction (adherents of Martin Van Buren), but St. Lawrence County&#x27;s Democratic-Republicans were anxious to end the Clinton-Van Buren rivalry prior to the 1824 presidential election. As a result, the Clintonians in St. Lawrence County supported Wright. The Federalist Party had all but disappeared, but Clintonians in Washington County nominated Allen R. Moore. The district covered six counties and while Moore ran well in most, Wright&#x27;s large majority in St. Lawrence County (he received every vote in Canton but his own) was sufficient for him to prevail in the general election. He was elected to a four-year term.

When Wright took his seat in January 1824, he became involved in an Albany Regency effort to remove DeWitt Clinton from the Erie Canal Commission. Clinton had long been identified as the main proponent of the project, and though his political career was at an ebb, voter outrage over his removal propelled Clinton&#x27;s return to the governorship in 1825.

In 1826, Senator Jasper Ward was accused by the press of corruption in the legislature&#x27;s approval of acts of incorporation for two insurance companies. Ward requested that the senate investigate, and Wright was named chairman of the committee that examined the question. Wright&#x27;s committee concluded that most of the charges in the newspapers were false, but that there was enough truth in them to recommend that Ward be expelled from the senate. Ward resigned, and the senate took no further action.

==Congressman==
In 1826, Wright was elected to the U.S. House as a Bucktail. In the two-member 20th District, Wright and his running mate Rudolph Bunner defeated Clintonians Nicoll Fosdick and Elisha Camp. Wright served in the 20th Congress, March 4, 1827 to February 16, 1829. In the House, Wright supported the protectionist Tariff of 1828 (the Tariff of Abominations), though he later changed his stance and became an advocate of low tariffs to fund the federal government - &quot;for revenue only&quot; in the political language of the day.

Wright was a candidate for reelection to the 21st Congress in 1828, but appeared to lose to George Fisher. Wright contested the results, but Fisher was seated and served from March 4, 1829, to February 5, 1830, when the contest was decided in Wright&#x27;s favor. Already serving as state comptroller, Wright declined to qualify for the House seat, which remained vacant until Jonah Sanford was seated following a special election in November 1830.

==State comptroller==
In January 1829, incumbent William L. Marcy resigned as New York State Comptroller in order to accept a judgeship. The comptroller was elected by a joint ballot of the state legislature for a three-year term and the legislators selected Wright to fill the vacancy. In this office, Wright was also an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the state canal commission, and his duties included oversight of the state canal system as well as management of the state&#x27;s general fund. During his term, he focused on the Bucktail priority of avoiding debt, arguing for limited canal maintenance and construction paid for from available funds rather than financing more expansive improvements over time. He was reelected in February 1832 and served until January 4, 1833, when he resigned to accept election to the U.S. Senate.

==U.S. Senator==
After DeWitt Clinton&#x27;s death in 1828, Van Buren&#x27;s Bucktail supporters became known as Jacksonians (followers of Andrew Jackson at the national level) and the Jacksonians eventually adopted the name Democrats. In 1833, Wright was the successful Democratic nominee for U.S. Senator, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of William L. Marcy. He was reelected in 1837 and served from January 4, 1833, to November 26, 1844.

Wright served as chairman of the Finance Committee from 1836 to 1841. He supported Henry Clay&#x27;s compromise Tariff of 1833 and voted for the Tariff of 1842.

An opponent of centralized banking, Wright defended Andrew Jackson&#x27;s removal of federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War and opposed the recharter of the United States Bank. He also opposed Clay&#x27;s plan to distribute surplus federal funds to the states. When Van Buren succeeded Jackson as president in 1837, Wright supported his plan for an Independent Treasury to replace the Bank of the United States.

Wright voted no when John C. Calhoun moved to stop receiving petitions to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but voted yes on excluding anti-slavery materials from U.S. mail in the slave-holding states. In 1838, Wright opposed William Cabell Rives&#x27; resolution declaring that citizens of the states had no right to interfere with slavery in the federal territories and that the residents of the territories had jurisdiction.

During the administration of President John Tyler, Wright voted against the treaty for the annexation of Texas, believing immediate annexation would cause unrest on the slavery issue. In 1844, Wright declined Tyler&#x27;s offer to appoint him to a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court.

==1844 Democratic national convention==
Wright had campaigned for Martin Van Buren in 1840, when Van Buren lost his bid for reelection as president. In 1844, Wright again supported Van Buren for president. Van Buren was initially the front runner at the party&#x27;s May national convention, but his opposition to Texas annexation cost him support among southern delegates who favored the expansion of slavery, and he could not obtain the two-thirds majority required under the convention&#x27;s rules. Upon learning that some delegates were considering him as a compromise choice for the presidential nomination, Wright sent a letter to a New York delegate asking to be withdrawn from consideration and pledging his continued support for Van Buren.

When dark horse James K. Polk won the presidential nomination, southern Democrats attempted to appease Van Buren supporters by nominating Wright for vice president. Samuel Morse was in Washington, DC to demonstrate the telegraph, which he used to send and receive convention updates from Baltimore. Upon being informed by telegraph of his selection, Wright declined the nomination, partly from refusal to support a ticket backing the annexation of Texas, and partly to avoid accusations of intriguing against Van Buren to benefit himself. Skeptical delegates then dispatched a committee to Washington by train to confirm the news in person. When Wright told the emissaries his refusal was firm, they returned to Baltimore, then spent the next day sending messages by telegraph in an effort to get him to reconsider. Finally persuaded that he would not change his mind, delegates nominated George M. Dallas for vice president. Despite his misgivings on the Texas question, Wright campaigned for the Polk-Dallas ticket, which won the general election and took office in 1845.

==Governor==
In August 1844, the New York state Democratic convention nominated Wright for governor. He accepted, and entered the general election contest against Whig nominee Millard Fillmore. Wright defeated Fillmore, and took office in January 1845.

As governor, Wright continued his conservative approach to state finances, vetoing a bill appropriating money for work on the state&#x27;s canals because he thought the amount was excessive. He also took the side of the patroon landlords in New York&#x27;s Anti-Rent War. When anti-rent tenants caused unrest in Delaware County, Wright declared a state of insurrection and dispatched the militia to restore order. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1846, losing to Whig nominee John Young, who was supported by the anti-rent tenants.

==Death and burial==
On August 27, 1847, Wright suffered a heart attack or stroke while at the post office in Canton, which his friends believed was brought on by overwork while tending to outdoor chores at his farm in hot weather. In addition, Wright had recently given up alcohol after years of heavy drinking, and quitting suddenly may have had a negative effect on his health. Medical attention was summoned, and he was soon well enough to walk home, but he collapsed again and died shortly after reaching his house. He was buried at Old Canton Cemetery. Wright&#x27;s death was sudden and surprised his political supporters, who had been planning to offer him as a candidate in the 1848 presidential election.

==Family==
In 1833, Wright married Clarissa Moody (1804–1870), the daughter of the family friend who had persuaded him to settle in Canton. They had no children.

==Legacy==
In 1838, Wright received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Vermont.

In 1848, the people of Weybridge, Vermont erected a monument to Wright; it includes sculptures by Erastus Dow Palmer and stands in the center of town along Vermont Route 23. The Wright memorial inspired the name of a nearby dairy, Monument Farms.

Silas Wright was the namesake of Wright County, Missouri and Wright County, Minnesota. In addition, he was the namesake of Wright, New York, a town in Schoharie County.

Wright Peak, an Adirondack Park mountain in North Elba, New York, is named for Wright.

The Silas Wright House at 3 East Main Street in Canton is now a museum and the home of the St. Lawrence County Historical Association.

<text>Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium, originally named Memphis Memorial Stadium, and later Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, is a football stadium located at the former Mid-South Fairgrounds in the Midtown area of Memphis, Tennessee, United States. The stadium is the site of the annual Liberty Bowl, the annual Southern Heritage Classic, and is the home field of the University of Memphis Tigers football team of the American Athletic Conference. It has also been the host of several attempts at professional sports in the city, as well as other local football games and other gatherings.

==History==

The stadium was originally built as Memphis Memorial Stadium in 1965 for $3 million, as a part of the Mid-South Fairgrounds, then home to one of the South&#x27;s most popular fairs, but now conducted in neighboring DeSoto County, Mississippi. The fairgrounds also included the now-defunct Mid-South Coliseum (formerly the city&#x27;s major indoor venue) as well as the now-closed Libertyland amusement park, which has been demolished and replaced with an amateur indoor sports venue. It was dedicated as a memorial to the citizens of Memphis who had served in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.

The facility was built partially as a way to bring the Liberty Bowl to a permanent home in Memphis (the game had started in Philadelphia, but because of poor attendance as a northern bowl, it left the city, playing one year in Atlantic City before settling in Memphis). The game was such a success for Memphis that the stadium was renamed Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in December 1975. As originally built, the stadium was lopsided, with the southwest side being taller than the northeast side. A 1987 expansion brought it to its current, balanced configuration, although with a much greater hospitality building topping the northeast section.

Its design is similar to that of old Tampa Stadium (&quot;The Big Sombrero&quot;), with the endzone grandstands being much shorter than the sidelines. The stadium is designed in such a way that all of its seats have a relatively good view of most of the playing surface. This is due primarily to two design factors. The stands are relatively steep for a one-tier, true bowl stadium. Also, there is little space between the side and end lines of the playing surface and the stands. 

In December 1983, the playing field was renamed &quot;Rex Dockery Field&quot; in honor of Rex Dockery, a former Memphis Tigers football coach who had recently died in a plane crash. The field, which had been natural grass since its inception, was replaced with a FieldTurf surface before the 2005 season; this was subsequently replaced with the modern version of AstroTurf.

In 2013, the Liberty Bowl and its setting received a $38 million facelift. It was repainted, and new lighting, new elevators, new turf, renovation of luxury boxes, better handicapped access, were added as part of the design by Memphis architect Tom Marshall of O.T. Marshall Architects. In addition, two new video boards were added, costing $2.5 million and including a Jumbotron, contributed by FedEx, which is headquartered in Memphis. In addition, Tiger Lane was created as a green space for tailgating and community events.

On January 9, 2024, the City of Memphis transferred ownership of the stadium to the University of Memphis and contributed $120 million to renovations of the stadium, with an additional $50 million coming from FedEx chairman Fred Smith, and $50 million from the university. The renovations include the destruction and replacement of the west side tower and most of the west side of the bowl, new premium seating, renovating the east side suites, and updating hospitality spaces around the stadium. Permanent seating capacity will be reduced to approximately 50,000 upon completion of the project.

==Tenants==
===Major tenants===
Since its opening, the stadium has hosted the Memphis Tigers football team from the University of Memphis. Before this, the team had spent 29 seasons at Crump Stadium. It was not the first time the team had played at the fairgrounds; before playing at Crump, the team had played two seasons there at a former park. As of the start of the 2006 season, the team had a 130-106-7 record at the stadium.

Also since its opening, the stadium has hosted the Liberty Bowl game. It annually hosts teams from the SEC and Big 12 conference.

Since 2006, the second bid has gone to a team from the SEC, setting up an all-Southern bowl game. As of 2010, the SEC has the right to override the Conference USA champion and instead replace them with an opponent from the Big East Conference, now the American Athletic Conference. At the same time, the PapaJohns.com Bowl was given the option of a Conference USA team instead of a Big East team. They chose not to do this for the first year of this arrangement, allowing C-USA champions UCF to play Georgia.

The stadium is also the host of the &quot;Southern Heritage Classic&quot;, a game between two historically black schools, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and Tennessee State University. The stadium also has hosted home games of the Tennessee Vols, Ole Miss Rebels, and Mississippi State Bulldogs.

The Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football played in the stadium for its sole season in 2019.

The Memphis Showboats of the United Football League play in the stadium. The Houston Gamblers will played there as a hub team in 2023.

===Early professional football===

In 1974 and 1975, the stadium hosted the Memphis Southmen, aka &quot;Grizzlies&quot;, of the World Football League. The Southmen drew fairly well, at least by WFL standards, in part due to the presence on their roster of some well-known players recruited away from the NFL at considerable expense. By nearly all accounts, they would have been a viable venture had the WFL been better run.

Much, perhaps too much, was read into this relative success at the gate. When the WFL folded, the team formally changed its name to the Grizzlies and made a bid to join the NFL as an expansion team for the 1976 NFL season, with a telethon even being staged for this purpose. Over 40,000 people put down deposits for season tickets for the would-be NFL team. Despite this seemingly overwhelming show of support, the NFL ignored Memphis&#x27; pleas and the Southmen folded. Owner John Bassett filed a lawsuit against the league, but was unsuccessful.

In 1984, the original United States Football League added the Memphis Showboats as an expansion team. The Showboats, featuring defensive end Reggie White and coached by flamboyant Memphian Pepper Rodgers, were one of the better draws in the league. They advanced to the semifinals in 1985. Much like the Southmen before them, it was generally believed the Showboats would have been a viable venture had their league been better organized.

However, this attempt caused the city of Memphis to decide on expanding the stadium, in the hopes of luring an NFL franchise to the city. To this end, the Liberty Bowl underwent a $12 million facelift. As mentioned above, the stands were built up to the same level as the west ones, adding about 12,000 seats, and a &quot;skybox&quot; of luxury suites was added to the top of those stands. After the renovation, the then-St. Louis Cardinals played an exhibition game there before a sellout crowd.

Despite its efforts, the city was unsuccessful in luring an NFL team (which would have been called the &quot;Memphis Hound Dogs&quot;) to the Liberty Bowl.

===Mad Dogs===
Not willing to give up on pro football, in 1995 the Liberty Bowl welcomed the Memphis Mad Dogs as part of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s attempt at bringing their league into American markets.

Due to the design features noted earlier, it was extremely difficult to shoehorn a Canadian football field onto the Liberty Bowl&#x27;s playing surface. Canadian fields are 10 yards longer and 35 feet wider than in the U.S. version, and the end zones are 20 yards deep rather than 10; few U.S. football stadiums are designed to easily accommodate a playing surface of this size. Had the attempt to play the Canadian game included a CFL full-width field, players not participating in the game and the coaching staffs would have to have been seated in the stands. Likewise, 20 yards past the goal line at the Liberty Bowl puts one several rows up into the end zone stands. AstroTurf sections were added around the grass field to accommodate the required width, while the end zones became half AstroTurf/half grass pentagons in order to bring the field to the required length. However, the end zones were nowhere near regulation; they averaged around 9 yards in length, and no other American stadium had end zones shorter than 15 yards. The stands jutted into the corners of the end zones, creating a distinct safety hazard. The only real concession to the Canadian format that was feasible at the Liberty Bowl was the moving of the goal posts to the goal line, where they are in the Canadian game, as opposed to the end line. The result was what amounted to a hybrid game, played by Canadian rules on essentially a U.S. field.

Despite these limitations, the Mad Dogs, coached by Rodgers, drew fairly well during the early part of the season. However, they were tripped up by quirks in the CFL schedule. The CFL season runs from July to November so as to conclude before the harsh Canadian winters set in and make conditions unbearable for players, coaches, officials, and especially spectators. Its games were generally scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights—the same nights on which high school and college football games are played in the United States. The Mad Dogs knew that once college football season started, most fans preferred to drive across Interstate 40 to watch Tennessee football or down Interstate 55 to watch Ole Miss or Mississippi State. (The Birmingham Barracudas faced similar problems due to competition from Alabama and Auburn.) With this in mind, the CFL moved the Mad Dogs and Barracudas&#x27; late season home games to Sunday afternoons. While this put both teams in direct competition with NFL television broadcasts, it was initially thought to be an acceptable risk since neither city was particularly loyal to one NFL team. However, even with these changes, the Liberty Bowl became a virtual ghost town late in the season, with several crowds well below 10,000. It soon became apparent that the Mad Dogs were not a viable venture. Although they finished one game out of the playoffs, their dreadful attendance figures caused them to fold at the end of the season along with the other American teams.

===Oilers===
In 1997, the NFL&#x27;s Houston Oilers announced that they would play two seasons in Memphis as the Tennessee Oilers before the Adelphia Coliseum, their new stadium in Nashville (now Nissan Stadium), was completed in time for the 1999 season. The largest stadium in Nashville at the time, Vanderbilt Stadium, then seated only 41,000 fans—too few even for temporary use. Vanderbilt University was also unwilling at the time to let beer be sold at games. Although the Vols&#x27; Neyland Stadium in Knoxville was slightly closer to Nashville, it was deemed too big (at over 102,000 seats) for an NFL team. Pepper Rodgers was named the Oilers&#x27; &quot;Director of Memphis Operations.&quot; The team was to live and practice in Nashville, commuting to Memphis only for games.

Although the idea seemed acceptable enough to the league and the team at the time, the 1997 season was a disaster, because of the lack of fan ownership for the temporary team. Many Memphians wanted nothing to do with a team which would be lost in two years —especially to longtime rival Nashville. For their part, Nashvillians were skittish about having to drive to see &quot;their&quot; team play. In an unfortunate coincidence, Interstate 40 was undergoing extensive repairs just east of Memphis at the time. This lengthened the normal three hour drive from Nashville to Memphis to five hours or longer. As a result, the Oilers played before some of the smallest home crowds seen in the NFL since the 1950s for most games, and the visiting teams often seemed to have more supporters than the Oilers.

Even though none of the Oilers&#x27; first seven games attracted more than 27,000 people, Oilers&#x27; owner Bud Adams was initially willing to stick it out in Memphis for one more season. However, that changed with the only game that drew more fans than could have comfortably been accommodated at Vanderbilt, the year&#x27;s final game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. While 50,677 people showed up, the great majority of them (three-fourths of the crowd, by one estimate) were Steeler fans. Adams was so disgusted that he ripped up the Memphis agreement a year early in favor of playing at Vanderbilt in 1998.

===Maniax===
A subsequent major professional tenant was the Memphis Maniax of the first XFL. The Maniax finished tied for second place in the Western Division at 5–5 with the San Francisco Demons, but did not make the playoffs. The league folded after one season.

===Other former tenants===
From 1978 to 1980, the Memphis Rogues of the North American Soccer League called the stadium home. The playing surface is somewhat smaller than that generally favored by soccer, but that sport adapts to smaller playing surfaces better than some others (the preferred width of a soccer pitch is 70 to 80 yards, but the rules allow for a pitch as narrow as 50 yards wide). Like the Southmen, the Rogues seemingly did fairly well in a league that wasn&#x27;t doing all that well as a whole. Despite their success, the team moved to Calgary, although this move was due more to the owner, Nelson Skalbania, a Canadian businessman, wanting to move the team to his home country.

One of the more interesting events held in the stadium was an exhibition Major League Baseball game involving the Atlanta Braves and Milwaukee Brewers during the 1975 season. The game was sponsored by the Memphis Blues minor league team. The right-field fence was only from home plate, about shorter than the dimensions of most major league parks.

==Concerts==
==Future==
As of 2021, it is considered highly unlikely that there will be a permanent NFL franchise in the stadium or in the city. The stadium is more than adequate for the Tigers, a team which is currently playing in one of the larger stadiums in its current conference, the American Athletic Conference. The Liberty Bowl game is well-attended and averages crowds just under the stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity. There are a variety of factors that play into the city&#x27;s prospects, including:
*Memphis is considered to be in the Titans’ market under the current television agreements in the NFL. Also, while Memphis is the 25th-largest city in the United States, it has always been only a medium-sized television market (currently 44th), as the surrounding suburbs and rural areas are far smaller in population than the city proper. Its per capita income is less than is customary for a market that is usually under consideration for expansion or relocation of an existing team.
*The league itself is not in a position to be considering expansion at this time, in part due to there being in place a balanced schedule that works well. In addition, the city is located within of six current teams: the Titans, New Orleans Saints, Dallas Cowboys, Atlanta Falcons, Kansas City Chiefs, and Indianapolis Colts.
*Finally, the stadium itself does not meet current NFL standards. It does not have the required number of luxury boxes. Restroom facilities and concession stands seem relatively antiquated compared to those of newer facilities. The facility itself generally shows the wear and tear from five decades of use and Mid-South weather that it has endured. Perhaps the greatest hindrance is the one thing about its design that originally had made it so attractive to many. The single-deck, open bowl design precludes the construction of true &quot;club seats&quot;, the luxury seats located between the main lower and upper decks of most modern football stadiums which are a major source of additional revenues to ownership. These factors would make the major upgrades needed to bring the stadium up to NFL standards prohibitively expensive; it would almost be certainly more practical to replace it with an entirely new structure.

On January 1, 2007, then-Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton proposed a new stadium be built in place of the old one. Some in the University of Memphis community prefer the construction of a smaller, on-campus stadium, but such a venue would almost certainly be inadequate (in terms of capacity and amenities) for the Liberty Bowl. Although this proposal did not move ahead, the long-term future of Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium is currently unclear. However, it is thought that a separate on-campus stadium for the Tigers would be fiscally unrealistic if a new municipal stadium were to be built in addition to it.

The most recent professional tenant was the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football, which played its home games played in the stadium for its sole season in 2019.

It was announced on October 1, 2021 that Simmons Bank and the City of Memphis were in advanced negotiations to have Simmons Bank become the title sponsor for the stadium and renaming it from Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium to become Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium.

On May 12, 2022 officials revealed plans to renovate the stadium before the 2025 football season, costing around $200 million. Completed with help of architecture firm Populous, plans include:
*New premium seating options on the stadium’s west side.
*A &quot;halo space&quot; surrounding the stadium.
*Family boxes to the north side and party decks to the south side.
*Retrofit the east side suite tower.
Construction should begin after the 2023 football season; the Tigers will continue to play in the stadium during renovations. Seating capacity is expected to remain above 50,000 after the renovations are finished. 

In the same vote that transferred ownership to the University of Memphis, the City of Memphis also approved $120 million in funding for stadium renovations. In addition, the university received a $50 million grant ahead of the vote from FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith, with the stipulation that they would only receive the money when the university raises another $50 million.

==In popular culture==
Towards the end of the now iconic 2001 SpongeBob SquarePants episode &quot;Band Geeks&quot;, the Liberty Bowl was featured in a brief clip of a 1984 USFL game between the Showboats and the Tampa Bay Bandits before cutting to Squidward and his band playing &quot;Sweet Victory&quot; on the field.

<doc id="636051" wikidata="Q192721" url="?curid=636051" title="Củ Chi tunnels">
<text>The tunnels of Củ Chi () are an immense network of connecting tunnels located in the Củ Chi District of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam, and are part of a much larger network of tunnels that underlie much of the country. The Củ Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns during the Vietnam War, and were the Viet Cong&#x27;s base of operations for the Tết Offensive in 1968.
The tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as hiding spots during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters. The tunnel systems were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American and ARVN forces, and helped to counter the growing American military presence.

The tunnels contained various bamboo traps made by the Viet Cong to injure and potentially kill South Vietnam&#x27;s Tunnel Rats if they breached the tunnels. The tunnels also contained ventilation shafts to release smoke from fire and any poisonous gases pumped into the tunnels by the American G.I.s.

== Life in tunnels ==
American soldiers used the term &quot;Black Echo&quot; to describe the conditions within the tunnels. For the Viet Cong, life in the tunnels was difficult. Air, food, and water were scarce, and the tunnels were infested with ants, venomous centipedes, snakes, scorpions, spiders, and rodents. Most of the time, soldiers would spend the day in the tunnels working or resting and come out only at night to scavenge for supplies, tend their crops, or engage the enemy in battle. Sometimes, during periods of heavy bombing or American troop movement, they would be forced to remain underground for many days at a time. Sickness was rampant among the people living in the tunnels, especially malaria, which was the second largest cause of death next to battle wounds. A captured Viet Cong report suggests that at any given time, half of a unit of the People&#x27;s Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF) unit had malaria and that &quot;one-hundred percent had intestinal parasites of significance.&quot;

== U.S. campaigns against tunnels ==


The tunnels of Củ Chi were noticed by U.S. officials, who recognized the advantages that the Viet Cong held with the tunnels and so launched several major campaigns to search out and destroy the tunnel system. Among the most important were Operation Crimp and Operation Cedar Falls.

Operation Crimp began on January 7, 1966, with B-52 bombers dropping 30-ton loads of high explosive onto the region of Củ Chi, effectively turning the once lush jungle into a pockmarked moonscape. Eight thousand troops from the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (including an artillery battery of the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery), and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment combed the region looking for any clues of PLAF activity.
The operation did not bring about the desired success. For instance, when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. No one was usually sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two most common responses in dealing with a tunnel opening would be to flush the entrance with gas, water or hot tar to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open or to toss a few grenades down the hole and &quot;crimp&quot; off the opening. Those approaches proved ineffective because of the design of the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and air filtration systems.

However, an Australian specialist engineering troop, 3 Field Troop, under the command of Captain Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; MacGregor ventured into the tunnels, which they searched exhaustively for four days, and found ammunition, radio equipment, medical supplies, food, and signs of considerable Viet Cong presence. One of their number, Corporal Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Bowtell, died when he became trapped in a tunnel that turned out to be a dead end. However, the Australians pressed on and revealed for the first time the immense military significance of the tunnels. At an international press conference in Saigon shortly after Operation Crimp, MacGregor referred to his men as &quot;tunnel ferrets.&quot; An American journalist who had never heard of ferrets, used the term &quot;tunnel rat,&quot; and it stuck. After his troop&#x27;s discoveries in Củ Chi, MacGregor was awarded a Military Cross.

From its mistakes and the Australians&#x27; discoveries, U.S. command realised that it needed a new way to approach the dilemma of the tunnels. A general order was issued by General Williamson, the Allied Forces Commander in South Vietnam, to all Allied forces that tunnels had to be properly searched whenever they were discovered. It began training an elite group of volunteers in the art of tunnel warfare, armed only with a handgun, a knife, a flashlight, and a piece of string. The specialists, commonly known as &quot;tunnel rats&quot;, would enter a tunnel by themselves and travel inch-by-inch cautiously looking ahead for booby traps or cornered PLAF. There was no real doctrine for the approach, and despite some very hard work in some sectors of the Army and the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, to provide some sort of training and resources, it was primarily a new approach that the units trained, equipped, and planned for themselves.

Despite the revamped effort at fighting the enemy on their own terms, U.S. operations remained insufficient at eliminating the tunnels completely. In 1967, General William Westmoreland tried to launch a larger assault on Củ Chi and the Iron Triangle. Called Operation Cedar Falls, it was similar to the previous Operation Crimp but was on a larger scale with 30,000 troops, instead of 8,000. On January 18, tunnel rats from the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division uncovered the Viet Cong district headquarters of Củ Chi, containing half a million documents concerning all types of military strategy. Among the documents were maps of U.S. bases, detailed accounts of PLAF movement from Cambodia into Vietnam, lists of political sympathizers, and even plans for a failed assassination attempt on Robert McNamara.

By 1969, B-52s were freed from bombing North Vietnam and started &quot;carpet bombing&quot; Củ Chi and the rest of the Iron Triangle. Towards the end of the war, some of the tunnels were so heavily bombed that some portions actually caved in, and other sections were exposed. But the bombings were not able to destroy most parts of those tunnels.

Throughout the war, the tunnels in and around Củ Chi proved to be a source of frustration for the U.S. military in Saigon. The Viet Cong had been so well entrenched in the area by 1965 that it was in the unique position of being able to control where and when battles would take place. By helping to covertly move supplies and house troops, the tunnels of Củ Chi allowed North Vietnamese fighters in their area of South Vietnam to survive, help prolong the war and increase U.S. costs and casualties until the eventual withdrawal in 1973, and the final defeat of South Vietnam in 1975.

== Tourist destinations ==

The -long complex of tunnels at Củ Chi has been preserved by the government of Vietnam after reunification, and turned into a war memorial park with two different tunnel display sites, Ben Dinh and Ben Duoc. The tunnels are a popular tourist attraction in Vietnam, and visitors are invited to crawl around in the safer parts of the tunnel system. The Ben Duoc site contains part of the original tunnel system, and the Ben Dinh site, closer to Ho Chi Minh City, has tunnel reconstructions and some tunnels have been made larger to accommodate tourists. In both sites, low-power lights have been installed in the tunnels to make traveling through them easier, and both sites have displays of the different types of booby traps that were used. Underground conference rooms in which campaigns such as the Tết Offensive were planned in 1968 have been restored.

Above-ground attractions include caged monkeys, vendors selling souvenirs, and a shooting range.

<doc id="636054" wikidata="Q2992562" url="?curid=636054" title="Confluence Park">
<text>Confluence Park is an urban park encompassing the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River in Denver&#x27;s Lower Downtown (LoDo), a bustling district of 19th-century brick warehouses and storefronts that has been redeveloped since the late 1980s.

== Current usage ==

The park includes concrete trails often filled with walkers, runners, and bikers. Some grassy areas, river overlooks, and park benches are also available. Two pedestrian bridges cross the South Platte River and Cherry Creek at Confluence Park. The eastern edge of the South Platte in Confluence Park has been transformed into a kayak run, immediately across from R.E.I.&#x27;s (Recreational Equipment Inc.) Colorado flagship store. The park is adjacent to a number of new up-scale townhouses, apartments, and loft developments, another park bordering the South Platte downstream, train tracks, and Denver&#x27;s skatepark.

The Platte Valley Trolley originates in Confluence Park, running along the west side of the South Platte River from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, and for all Denver Broncos home games.

== History ==
Confluence Park marks the area where William Greeneberry Russell&#x27;s party began its local search for gold in May 1858. They found no gold at the confluence, but they turned up &quot;good diggings&quot; at the mouth of Little Dry Creek, about four miles south. The discovery was an immediate cause of the Colorado Gold Rush, and the encampment would become Denver. Part of the site previously hosted an Xcel Energy substation, which was relocated to allow for the expansion of the park.

<text>Twenty Bucks is a 1993 American comedy-drama film directed by Keva Rosenfeld and starring Linda Hunt, Brendan Fraser, Gladys Knight, Elisabeth Shue, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Lloyd, William H. Macy, David Schwimmer, Shohreh Aghdashloo and Spalding Gray. The film follows the travels of a $20 bill from its delivery via armored car in an unnamed American city through various transactions and incidents from person to person.

For his performance, Christopher Lloyd won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male in 1994.

==Plot==

An armored truck brings money to load an ATM. A woman withdraws $20 but the bill slips away. A homeless woman, Angeline, grabs the bill and reads the serial number, proclaiming that it is her destiny to win the lottery with those numbers. As she holds the bill, a boy grabs the bill from her and uses it at a bakery. The baker sells an expensive pair of figurines for a wedding cake to Jack Holiday and gives him the bill as change. At the rehearsal dinner for the upcoming wedding of Sam Mastrewski to Anna Holiday, Jack reminisces about exchanging his foreign money for American currency when he first came to America, and he presents Sam with the $20 bill as a wedding present. Sam is taken aback by the perceived cheapness of his father-in-law-to-be, but is quickly &quot;kidnapped&quot; for his bachelor party, where he decides to spend the bill to pay the party&#x27;s stripper. Anna shows up to explain that the $20 was not the entire present and suggests that Sam frame it to show that he understands its significance. Sam is unable to explain the absence of the bill, when the stripper comes in from the fire escape to offer it back to him. Anna apparently breaks the engagement.

The stripper uses the $20 bill to buy a herbal remedy from Mrs. McCormac. Mrs. McCormac mails the bill to her grandson Bobby as a birthday present. Bobby goes to a convenience store where Frank and Jimmy are engaged in a string of robberies. During their spree, they prevent Angeline from buying a lottery ticket at a liquor store. Not knowing he&#x27;s a robber, Bobby gives Jimmy the bill to buy him some wine, as he can&#x27;t buy it himself because he&#x27;s underage. Jimmy goes into the store to find that Frank has botched the robbery. Jimmy and Frank leave, giving Bobby and his girlfriend Peggy champagne. The police chase the robbers, who hide in a used car lot. After the police pass by, Jimmy and Frank split up the money, but when Frank sees the $20 Jimmy got from the kid, he assumes that Jimmy is holding out on him. Jimmy tries to explain but Frank pulls a shotgun on him. Jimmy shoots Frank and takes all the money they&#x27;ve stolen, but leaves the $20 bill. The bill, now stained with Frank&#x27;s blood, winds up in the police evidence locker but falls into the wrong box.

Waitress and aspiring writer Emily Adams shows up at the police precinct with boyfriend Neil to claim a box of items the police recovered. The police officer unwittingly includes the $20 bill among the other items. After flying out of the box from the back seat of Emily&#x27;s convertible, the bill floats around town, and is picked up by a homeless man who uses it to buy groceries. Angeline is again unable to buy a lottery ticket, this time due to a fault with the cashier&#x27;s computer. The bill is given as change to a wealthy woman who uses it to snort cocaine off the back of her stretch limousine, although she leaves it on her car, where it is picked up by her drug dealer.

The drug dealer also runs a day camp for youth, and he puts the bill into a fish where it is caught by a teen who has it converted to quarters and uses them to call a phone sex hotline in a bowling alley. The bowling alley owner gives the bill to his lover and tells him to go out and have fun. The owner&#x27;s lover then encounters Sam, who is loitering in a daze behind the bowling alley. Sam turns down an offer of the $20 bill, not knowing it is the cause of his downfall. The owner&#x27;s lover then uses it to play bingo at a church, where the priest is portrayed by Spalding Gray. Emily&#x27;s father, Bruce, also plays bingo and receives the bill as change before dying of a heart attack.

At the mortuary, the mortician gives the family Bruce&#x27;s personal effects, including his wallet with the $20 bill. Emily eventually looks in the wallet and finds the $20 bill in the wallet together with a copy of her first published short story. Her mother Ruth explains that Bruce also wanted to be a writer. Emily decides to go to Europe. At the airport, she explains her decision to her brother Gary, and she melodramatically rips up the bill in front of him (Gary was a witness to one of Jimmy &amp; Frank&#x27;s robberies). Sam is also at the airport, waiting for a flight to Europe and having a drink with Jack, with the two clearing up the misunderstanding over the $20 bill on good terms. Sam finds a piece of the ripped up bill and uses it as a bookmark, but it falls out without him noticing it as Sam and Emily walk toward their gate, both striking up a conversation. A title reading &quot;The End&quot; is derailed by Angeline collecting pieces of the bill.

Angeline sits down at a coin-operated TV and patches the bill back together with adhesive tape. Just then, the lottery numbers are read, and to her dismay, they match the serial number of the bill. Bringing the taped bill with her to a bank, she asks if it is still any good. The teller explains that if there&#x27;s more than 51% of the bill left, it is still valid, and hands Angeline a crisp new $20 bill. The homeless woman dramatically reads the serial number of the new bill and leaves the bank.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was based on a screenplay that was nearly 60 years old. It was originally written by Endre Bohem in 1935, but was never filmed; his son, Leslie, discovered it in the 1980s and revised it, modernizing the language and some of the plot. This version of the screenplay was then used for the film. The elder Bohem wrote his spec script soon after the release of &quot;If I Had a Million&quot;.

In one of the production featurettes, Rosenfeld says that the bills used in the production were figured into the production costs of the film. The producers obtained several bills with consecutive serial numbers, as well as &quot;every thousandth bill&quot; so that some bills would have the right first few digits of the serial number and others the right last few digits. The bills were then selectively damaged in specific ways as required by the script. When they were done with the bills, Rosenfeld says the bills were dropped into the petty cash fund money.

===Filming locations===
Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed in Minneapolis; the rest and nearly all of the indoor scenes were filmed in Los Angeles. The scene where Angeline captures the bill was filmed on North 4th Street in downtown Minneapolis, in front of Fire Station No. 10 (with traffic driving the wrong way for the movie). The scene where Angeline visits McCormac and McCormac mails the bill (and Jimmy and Frank meet) was filmed in the 1000 block of West Broadway in Minneapolis (now demolished). The supermarket scene was filmed at a Holiday Plus supermarket (now part of the Cub Foods chain) in suburban Minneapolis. The bill floats near the Mississippi River just above St. Anthony Falls; over the 3rd Avenue Bridge; and past the E-Z Stop gas station at 1624 Washington Ave. North. The Adams house was filmed on the Near North side of Minneapolis at 1802 Bryant Ave N near the E-Z Stop station. The final scene was filmed in an actual bank, Marquette Bank Minneapolis at 90 S. 6th Street, which is now a restaurant named Bank.

==Critical reception==
While many critics saw the film as a series of uneven vignettes, Roger Ebert thought that &quot;the very lightness of the premise gives the film a kind of freedom. We glimpse revealing moments in lives, instead of following them to one of those manufactured movie conclusions that pretends everything has been settled.&quot; Ebert was so engrossed by Christopher Lloyd&#x27;s performance that he almost forgot about the film&#x27;s title object, and liked the movie as a whole while acknowledging its vignette construction.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed the film, &quot;A charming, offbeat tale shaped whimsically by the hand of fate. Rosenfeld manages to take a premise that is all contrivance and make it seem natural, as if every bit of legal tender had such a colorful life.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;Rosenfeld impressively summons up the ghosts of Capra and Sturges while keeping this tale firmly in the here and now.&quot;

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Thanks to director Keva Rosenfeld, a documentary filmmaker, its story seems to come about serendipitously. The film&#x27;s pace, bouncy as Lotto balls in a tank, adds to the lightheartedness of this surprisingly droll look at the cost of living.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an aggregated score of 75% based on 8 reviews.

=== Scholarly assessment ===
Film scholars have compared this &quot;Twenty Bucks&quot; to other films and television shows which track a single object traded among various persons (such as &quot;Diamond Handcuffs&quot;, &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot;, &quot;The Gun&quot; (1974), &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Gun&quot; (1997), &quot;The Red Violin&quot;, etc.). However, by emphasizing a ubiquitous object rather than a unique object (such as the auction-worthy violin in &quot;The Red Violin&quot;), this film &quot;ushers the genre into heretofore unexplored territory.&quot;
