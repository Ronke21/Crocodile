<text>Yom HaZikaron (), in full Yom HaZikaron LeHalelei Ma&#x27;arkhot Yisrael ul&#x27;Nifge&#x27;ei Pe&#x27;ulot HaEivah (), is Israel&#x27;s official remembrance day, enacted into law in 1963. While Yom HaZikaron has been traditionally dedicated to fallen soldiers, commemoration has also been extended to civilian victims of terrorism.

==History==

In 1949 and 1950, the first two years after the declaration of the State, memorial services for soldiers who fell in the War of Independence were held on Independence Day. Services at military cemeteries were coordinated between the IDF and the Ministry of Defense. A concern arose, expressed by families of fallen soldiers, to establish a separate memorial day observance distinct from the festive celebrations of national independence. In response, and in light of public debate on the issue, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion – also serving as Minister of Defense – established in January 1951 the &quot;Public Council for Soldiers&#x27; Commemoration&quot;. This council recommended establishing the 4th of Iyyar, the day preceding Independence Day, as the &quot;General Memorial Day for the Heroes of the War of Independence&quot;. This proposal won government approval that same year.

In 2023, the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism announced a new policy that non-Israeli Jewish victims of antisemitic terror attacks outside of Israel should officially be mourned as part of each year&#x27;s Yom HaZikaron commemoration. The policy was conceived as a way for Israel to demonstrate solidarity with the Jewish diaspora.

==Observance==
Yom HaZikaron is the national remembrance day observed in Israel for all Israeli military personnel who lost their lives in the struggle that led to the establishment of the State of Israel and for those who have been killed subsequently while on active duty in Israel&#x27;s armed forces. As of Yom HaZikaron 2022, that number was 24,213.

===Preceding evening===
The day opens with a siren the preceding evening at 20:00 (8:00 pm), given that in the Hebrew calendar system, a day begins at sunset. The siren is heard all over the country and lasts for one minute, during which Israelis stop everything, including driving on highways, and stand in silence, commemorating the fallen and showing respect.

By law, all places of entertainment are closed on the eve of Yom HaZikaron, and broadcasting and educational bodies note the solemnity of the day. Regular television programs cease for the day, and the names and ranks of every soldier who died for Israel are displayed in a 24-hour television broadcast.

Since the founding of the state, Israel has chosen the Red Everlasting flower (, , &#x27;blood of the Maccabees&#x27;) as the national memorial flower. The flower is depicted in many memorial sites and can be seen worn as stickers on shirts and jackets throughout Yom HaZikaron. Since 2019, the non-profit organization , has been distributing pins with the real Red Everlasting flower throughout Israel and the United States.

===Main memorial day===
A two-minute siren is sounded at 11:00 the following morning, which marks the opening of the official memorial ceremonies and private remembrance gatherings at each cemetery where soldiers are buried.

Many Israelis visit the resting places of loved ones throughout the day.

National memorial services are held in the presence of Israel&#x27;s top leadership and military personnel.

Memorial candles are lit in homes, army camps, schools, synagogues, and public places, and flags are lowered to half staff. Throughout the day, serving and retired military personnel serve as honor guards at war memorials throughout the country, and the families of the fallen participate in memorial ceremonies at military cemeteries.

Many traditional and religious Jews say prayers for the souls of the fallen soldiers on Yom HaZikaron. Special prayers prescribed by the Israeli rabbinate are recited. These include the recital of Psalm 9: &quot;For the leader, on the death of the son,&quot; and Psalm 144: &quot;Blessed be the Lord, My Rock, who traineth my hands for war and my fingers for battle&quot; in addition to memorial prayers for the dead. The official ceremony to mark the opening of the day takes place at the Western Wall.

Israeli TV channels screen the names of all civilians killed in pogroms since 1851, and all fallen from 1860 (considered the date of the beginning of the Yishuv by the Israeli Ministry of Defense), in chronological order (rank, name, Hebrew date deceased and secular date) over the course of the day. Originally, this was done by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority&#x27;s Channel 33; once the IBA was dissolved and replaced by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, the screening itself was moved to KAN 11 in lieu of Makan 33.
The day officially draws to a close at sundown (between 19:00 and 20:00; 7–8 p.m.) in a ceremony at the national military cemetery on Mount Herzl, marking the start of Israel Independence Day, when the flag of Israel is returned to full staff.

Scheduling Yom HaZikaron right before Independence Day is intended to remind people of the price paid for independence and of what was achieved with the soldiers&#x27; sacrifice. This transition shows the importance of this day among Israelis, most of whom have served in the armed forces, or have a connection with people who were killed during their military service.

==Timing==
The normative day for Yom HaZikaron is the fourth day of the month of Iyar, with Yom HaAtzmaut following immediately on the next day (fifth of Iyar). This rarely occurs. The construction of the current Hebrew calendar allows these two dates to only occur on certain days of the week, but most of those possibilities will conflict with the Jewish Shabbat. The holidays are adjusted so neither falls out on the Shabbat, or even on Friday and Sunday. (Falling out on Friday would interfere with Shabbat preparation and cause overlap of the events on Friday evening. Falling out on Sunday would cause a similar conflict with the end of Shabbat on Saturday evening, as Yom HaZikaron always starts at 8:00, which might be earlier than dusk on Saturday night.)

The possible normative days and their adjustments are:

* Sunday-Monday: Yom HaZikaron would start 8:00 Saturday night. They are both pushed off a day to Monday the 5th of Iyar and Tuesday the 6th. &quot;Example: 2017 (5777)&quot;
* Tuesday-Wednesday: This is the only case without any conflict with the Shabbat, so no adjustment is needed and observance stays on normative dates of the 4th and 5th of Iyar. &quot;Example: 2023 (5783)&quot;
* Thursday-Friday: The end of Yom HaAtzmaut would run into the Shabbat (Friday evening). Holidays are advanced one day to Wednesday Iyar 3 and Thursday Iyar 4. Example: 2022 (5782)
* Friday- Saturday: Direct conflict with the full Shabbat. A single day move would not suffice, as advancing by one day would still leave Yom HaAtzmaut on Friday, bleeding into the Shabbat, and postponing one day would move Yom HaZikaron directly onto the Shabbat. Instead, they are advanced two days to Wednesday Iyar 2 and Thursday Iyar 3. &quot;Example: 2021 (5781)&quot;

No other combination is possible. The calendar never has the 4th and 5th on Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday-Thursday, or Saturday-Sunday.

<text>Haast Pass / Tioripatea is a mountain pass in the Southern Alps of the South Island of New Zealand. Māori used the pass in pre-European times.

The pass takes its name from Julius von Haast, a 19th-century explorer who also served as provincial geologist for the provincial government of Canterbury. Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the pass was officially altered to Haast Pass / Tioripatea. The pass lies within the limits of Mount Aspiring National Park and forms part of the boundary between the Otago and West Coast regions.

The Haast Pass is one of the three passes where a road crosses over the Southern Alps – alongside the Lewis Pass and Arthur&#x27;s Pass, although the Homer Tunnel passes under the Main Divide. The Haast Pass rises to a height of above sea level at the saddle between the valleys of the Haast and Makarora Rivers. As such, it is the lowest of the passes traversing the Southern Alps.

The route through Haast Pass (now ) was converted from a rough track to a formed road that reached the Haast township in 1960, but was not linked with the rest of the West Coast until 1965.
No settlements exist on the Haast Pass road between Haast and Makarora. The road passes through predominantly unmodified beech forest. Between the township of Haast and the summit of the pass, State Highway 6 follows the route of the Haast River, and provides access and viewing points for several notable waterfalls including (west-to-east): Roaring Billy Falls, Thunder Creek Falls, and Fantail Falls.

==History==
Ngāi Tahu used the pass to cross from Lake Wānaka to the West Coast. At the time of European exploration, it was notorious for its use in 1835 by a war party led by Te Pūoho-o-te-rangi; a surprise crossing enabled Te Pūoho to ambush seasonal villages in the Makarora valley.

Europeans first learnt of the pass when Huruhuru drew a map for the explorer Edward Shortland in 1844. The first European ascent was from the Wānaka side in March 1861, when the exploring survey John Holland Baker, seeking new sheep country, looked down from the saddle towards the West Coast. Charles Cameron, a gold prospector, claimed to have made the first crossing to the coast in 1863. However he was widely believed to have only got to the upper reaches of the Haast River / Awarua. The honour of first official crossing was claimed by Julius Haast, Canterbury&#x27;s provincial geologist, who led a five-man expedition in January 1863. He named the Haast River after himself, &quot;directed, so he said, by his provincial superindendent&quot;, and returned to Lake Wānaka &quot;nearly shoeless&quot; after six weeks.

By 1880, there was a good packhorse track across the pass, but work to form a road across the pass did not commence until 1929 when work began at Lake Hāwea. A further phase commenced from the east at Makarora in 1936, and proceeded as far as the Gates of Haast, but was then halted for several years because of diversion of resources to the Second World War. Further work on the western side of the Gates of Haast did not begin again until 1946. Progress was slow, and by 1955, there was still 10 miles of roadway to be formed on the western side of the gorge.

The Haast Pass road between Otago and southern Westland was officially opened in November 1960, but it was announced that a complete road closure would be required in the New Year to replace the existing temporary Bailey bridge at Gates of Haast with a permanent structure. In September 1961, the new Callender-Hamilton bridge was opened, after 3 months of total road closure. During this period, supplies for the Haast township, normally delivered via the road from Cromwell in Otago had to be hand-carried across a catwalk over the river from one truck on the Otago side to another truck on the West Coast side.

The official opening of the entire Haast Highway was held on 6 November 1965, following the completion of the last section between Haast and Paringa. However, a chipseal surface on the entire route was not completed until 1995.

In the early 20th century, a railway from the West Coast through the pass to Otago was suggested by local MP Tom Seddon; it would have linked the Ross Branch with the Otago Central Railway, which then terminated in Omakau. However, the line never came to fruition; the Otago Central Railway terminated in Cromwell and no railway was built south of Ross, just a lightly laid bush tramway to serve logging interests near Lake Ianthe.

<text>Goldscheider Porcelain Manufactory and Majolica Factory (; later: &quot;Goldscheider Keramik&quot;) was an Austrian ceramic manufactory, which specialized in porcelain, terracotta, faience, and bronze decorative objects.

==History==
In 1873, Friedrich Goldscheider came from the Bohemian city of Plzeň to Vienna, and in 1885 he founded the Goldscheider Porcelain Manufactory and Majolica Factory. It became one of the most influential ceramic manufactories of terracotta, faience and bronze objects in Austria, with subsidiaries in Plzeň, Paris, Leipzig and Florence. For over half a century, Goldscheider created masterpieces of historical revivalism, Art Nouveau (&quot;Jugendstil&quot;) and Art Deco.

Famous artists such as Josef Lorenzl, Stefan Dakon, Ida Meisinger and the two perhaps best known Austrian ceramic artists, Michael Powolny and Vally Wieselthier, worked for Goldscheider. Several of the artists who worked for Goldscheider also worked for other Viennese studios, such as Augarten, Keramos or for the German brands Rosenthal and Meissen.

After Friedrich Goldscheider death in 1897, his widow Regina Lewit–Goldscheider, and his brother Alois Goldscheider managed the business, and his sons Walter Goldscheider and Marcel Goldscheider managed the factories.

The Goldscheider family migrated in 1938 to the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Walter Goldscheider started a new factory in Trenton, New Jersey, and he returned to Vienna in 1950. Marcel Goldscheider went to Stoke-on-Trent and produced figurative ceramics for Myott, and he opened his own studio in the 1950s in Hanley. Both brothers died in the early 1960s.

More than 10,000 different models were created over a period of three generations. Since the very beginning, many of these won first prizes and gold medals at innumerable world fairs, exhibitions and trade fairs. Goldscheider figures are nowadays very much sought after by collectors worldwide and reach astonishing prices at auctions such as Sotheby&#x27;s, Christie&#x27;s, Dorotheum and on eBay.

The son of Friedrich Goldscheider, was an art publisher of sculptures in Paris during the Art Deco-era.

==Recent exhibitions==
Several exhibitions and lectures took place since the new book on Goldscheider was presented in 2007 to the public: a big Goldscheider exhibition was shown at the Vienna Museum (November 2007 – February 2008), at the LBI in New York (January–April 2009), as well as lectures in Prague at the Museum of Decorative Arts (June 2008) and at the 10th Worldwide Art Deco Congress in Montreal (May 2009). 

From June to October 2015, the Grassi Museum in Leipzig honoured the history of Goldscheider with an exhibition. Current exhibitions are usually shown at the official Goldscheider website.

<text>Tufnell Park is a London Underground station in Islington, close to its boundary with Camden. It is located in the Tufnell Park neighbourhood. It is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between Archway and Kentish Town stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2.

==Station==
The station has Passenger Operated Ticket Machines. The ticket office has been closed permanently. The station has two lifts between the street and the platform level, rather than escalators. Upon exiting the lifts, passengers are required to use stairs to reach the trains. The southbound platform lies at a lower level than the northbound.

==History==
The station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway. The building was designed by architect Leslie Green and the exterior features glazed terracotta (faïence) tiling, supplied by the Leeds Fireclay Company. Although close to Junction Road railway station on the Tottenham &amp; Hampstead Junction Railway, there was never a physical connection between the two stations.

The station was modernised in 2004 by Tube Lines. Major items of works were the communication systems, a complete retiling and new ceilings throughout. Ticket gates were installed some time later. The station also houses a large industrial ventilation fan as part of London Underground&#x27;s Cooling the Tube project. The fan runs year round along with fans at other Northern line locations. The station was closed between 8 June 2015 and 4 March 2016 for the replacement of the lifts.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 4, 134, and 390, and night route N20 serve the station.

<text>Wye River is a minor river in the northeast of the South Island of New Zealand. It feeds into the Wairau River.

A single lane Truss Bridge carries traffic on State Highway 63 over the river.

==Name==
The river was at one time known as the Little Wai to distinguish it from the Waihopai River. The form Wye may be a mistaken transcription of Wai, or named independently after the River Wye in Wales. The New Zealand Geographic Board recognised Wye River name as the official name of the river in 2021

<doc id="644044" wikidata="Q963465" url="?curid=644044" title="Unique selling proposition">
<text>In marketing, the unique selling proposition (USP), also called the unique selling point or the unique value proposition (UVP) in the business model canvas, is the marketing strategy of informing customers about how one&#x27;s own brand or product is superior to its competitors (in addition to its other values). 

This strategy was used in successful advertising campaigns of the early 1940s. The term was coined by Rosser Reeves, a television advertising pioneer of Ted Bates &amp; Company. Theodore Levitt, a professor at Harvard Business School, suggested that, &quot;differentiation is one of the most important strategic and tactical activities in which companies must constantly engage.&quot; The term has been extended to cover one&#x27;s &quot;personal brand&quot;.

==Definition==

A unique selling proposition (USP) refers to the unique benefit exhibited by a company, service, product or brand that enables it to stand out from competitors. The unique selling proposition must be a feature that highlights product benefits that are meaningful to consumers. USP focuses on explicit claims of uniqueness involving an objectively verifiable product attribute or benefit-in-use. In summary:

#Each advertisement must make a proposition to the consumer—not just words, product puffery, or show-window advertising. Each advertisement must say to each reader: &quot;Buy this product, for &quot;this specific benefit&quot;.&quot;
#The proposition must be one the competition cannot or does not offer. It must be unique—either in the brand or a claim, the rest of that particular advertising area does not make.
#The proposition must be strong enough to move the masses, i.e., attract new customers as well as maintain current customers.

== Importance ==
The USP concept is one of the eight broad approaches to creative executions in advertising. The USP approach can be effective where high levels of technological innovation characterise a product category. A clear USP helps consumers to understand differences - even non-existent differences - between brand offerings in a category, and may also help consumers to form a positive attitude towards a brand and may ultimately contribute to increased levels of brand recall.

In order to determine an appropriate USP for any given brand, marketers must undertake extensive research of the category as well as of consumers. It is important to be able to locate a space in the market, ensure that the feature is something that is unique, and also something that is valued by potential customers. Sellers also need to try selling a brand to themselves; this is so they know they are passionate about a product and confident it can succeed. The seller needs a key point to use when trying to sell their product or service, and coming up with it prior to selling will benefit. Having a point of difference to stand out is a major benefit in markets; customers will be drawn to a business if it offers something no one else has. Whether differences are subtle or blatant, they can be the driving force that ensures the end-consumer makes the desired decision in choosing one product over the competition.

In markets which contain many similar products, using a USP is one campaign method of differentiating the product from the competition. Products or services without differentiation risk the consumer seeing them as commodities and fungible, thus lowering price potential. Thus having a unique selling point is essential to have a successful business that can handle current competition, as well as possible future comers in similar markets.

The desktop personal-computer market provides one example with many manufacturers and the potential for new manufacturers at any time. Apple used the slogan &quot;Beauty outside, Beast inside&quot; for its Mac Pro campaign to differentiate its product as &quot;beautiful&quot; compared with any other desktop computer. Buyers of this product were willing to pay a premium price, compared with technically similar desktop computers. Apple differentiates itself with a focus on aesthetics and cutting-edge technologies.

On the other hand, Walmart differentiates itself through its campaign “save money, live better&quot; by having a focus on being the cheapest department store and reminding customers that it&#x27;s not how much one spends on a product that matters. This USP rests on strong, direct and concise messaging that gives consumers a clear picture of exactly what value they will receive for choosing a given brand or product.

Marketing strategies are very important for different companies to establish their identity and increase market share.

A good USP should target a specific audience. Furthermore, a USP should not only be unique, but also keep its promises in order to prove trustworthy.

==Examples==
The following are examples of unique selling propositions. What is commonly considered a slogan is enhanced with a differentiating benefit of the product or service. Typically, the uniqueness is delivered by a unique process, ingredient, or system that produces the benefit described.
*Anacin &quot;Fast, incredibly fast relief.&quot; In 1952, Rosser Reeves created a TV commercial that capitalized on Anacin&#x27;s &quot;special ingredient&quot;, caffeine, by suggesting limitations of other aspirin and repeating, three times, the differentiation proposition: &quot;fast&quot;. 
*M&amp;M&#x27;s: &quot;Melts in your mouth, not in your hand.&quot; M&amp;Ms use a patented hard sugar coating that keeps chocolate from melting in one&#x27;s hands.
*Head &amp; Shoulders: &quot;Clinically proven to reduce dandruff.&quot; Pyrithione Zinc was found, after 10 years of research, to be an ingredient that was actually effective in eliminating dandruff where other products were not effective. Adding the name &quot;Shoulders&quot; to the product name also indicated that the product eliminated the tell-tale white marks on clothing caused by dandruff flakes falling from the hair.
*Domino&#x27;s Pizza: &quot;You get fresh, hot pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less—or it&#x27;s free.&quot; 1973-1993 &quot;You Got 30 Minutes&quot; 2007- Domino&#x27;s uses what it calls the &quot;make line&quot; and other systems to make pizzas quickly.
*FedEx: &quot;When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight.&quot; 1978–1983. FedEx was the first company to specialize in overnight air freight and first to implement package tracking. This pioneering advantage was made possible by a new system outlined in the founder&#x27;s 1965 Yale paper.
*Metropolitan Life: &quot;Get Met. It Pays.&quot; Met &quot;Whole Life Policy&quot; introduced in 1984 was a sales success for the company. The policy offered one-third more coverage, for the same price, and grew in cash value for a bigger &quot;pay out&quot; over time. In advertisements, Met compared buying the policy to buying a home.
*Southwest Airlines: &quot;We are THE low-fare airline.&quot;

<text>The Fisher King (; ; ; ) is a figure in Arthurian legend, the last in a long line of British kings tasked with guarding the Holy Grail. The Fisher King is both the protector and physical embodiment of his lands, but a wound renders him impotent and his kingdom barren. Unable to walk or ride a horse, he is sometimes depicted as spending his time fishing while he awaits a &quot;chosen one&quot; who can heal him. Versions of the story vary widely, but the Fisher King is typically depicted as being wounded in the groin, legs, or thigh. The healing of these wounds always depends upon the completion of a hero-knight&#x27;s task.

Most versions of the story contain the Holy Grail and the Lance of Longinus as plot elements. In some versions, a third character is introduced; this individual, unlike the hero-knight archetype, is ignorant of the King&#x27;s power, but has the ability to save the king and land, or to doom it. Variations of this third party produce divergent legends. 

As a literary character, the Fisher King originates in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s unfinished writings of the adventures of Perceval. Many authors have endeavoured to complete and extend the work, resulting in various continuations. Major sources of the legend include Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Li&quot; &quot;Contes del Graal; Perceval, ou Le Conte du Graal&quot; (c. 1160–1180), Wauchier de Denain&#x27;s &quot;First Continuation&quot; (c. 1180–1200), Robert de Boron&#x27;s &quot;Didot-Perceval&quot; (c. 1191–1202), &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot; (c. 1200), &quot;Perlesvaus&quot; (c. 1200), Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; (c. 1217), and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot; (c. 1400).

==Character history==
=== Early origins ===
The Fisher King first appears in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot; in the late 12th century, but the character&#x27;s roots may lie in Celtic mythology. He may be derived from the figure of Brân the Blessed in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. In the Second Branch, Bran has a cauldron that can resurrect the dead, albeit imperfectly; those thus revived cannot speak. He gives this cauldron to the king of Ireland as a wedding gift for him and Bran&#x27;s sister Branwen. Later, Bran wages war on the Irish and is wounded in the foot or leg, and the cauldron is destroyed. He asks his followers to sever his head and take it back to Britain, and his head continues talking and keeps them company on their trip. The group lands on the island of Gwales, where they spend 80 years in a castle of joy and abundance, but eventually they leave and bury Bran&#x27;s head in London. This story has analogues in two other important Welsh texts: the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, in which King Arthur&#x27;s men must travel to Ireland to retrieve a magical cauldron, and the poem &quot;The Spoils of Annwn&quot;, which speaks of a similar mystical cauldron sought by Arthur in the otherworldly land of Annwn.

The Welsh Romance &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot; is based on Chrétien or derived from a common original, but it contains several prominent deviations and lacks a Grail. The character of the Fisher King appears (though he is not called such) and presents Peredur with a severed head on a platter. Peredur later learns that he was related to that king, and that the severed head was that of his cousin, whose death he must avenge by defeating the Nine Witches.

===Later medieval works===
The Fisher King is a character in Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot; (1180) which is the first of a series of stories and texts on the subject of Perceval and the Grail.

&quot;Parzival&quot; was written in 1210 by Wolfram von Eschenbach, thirty years after &quot;Perceval&quot;. Although a different work, it is strikingly similar to &quot;Perceval&quot;. The story revolves around the Grail Quest and once again the main character is Percival or Parzival. As in &quot;Perceval&quot;, Eschenbach&#x27;s story does not have Parzival ask the healing question initially, which results in him Questing for years. However, Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; differs from Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot; in three major ways. Firstly, the Fisher King is no longer nameless and is called &quot;Anfortas&quot;. Secondly, Eschenbach thoroughly describes the nature of the wound; it is a punishment for wooing a woman who is not meant for him (every Grail keeper is to marry the woman the Grail determines for him), and it causes him immense pain. Lastly, Parzival comes back to cure the Fisher King. &quot;Parzival&quot;, unlike its predecessor &quot;Perceval&quot;, has a definitive ending.

===Further medieval development===
The Fisher King&#x27;s next development occurred around the end of the 12th century in Robert de Boron&#x27;s , the first work to connect the Grail with Jesus. Here, the &quot;Rich Fisher&quot; is called &quot;Bron&quot;, a name similar enough to Bran to suggest a relationship, and said to be the brother-in-law of Joseph of Arimathea, who had used the Grail to catch Christ&#x27;s blood before laying him in the sepulchre. Joseph founds a religious community that travels eventually to Britain and entrusts the Grail to Bron (who is called the &quot;Rich Fisher&quot; because he catches a fish eaten at the Grail table). Bron founds the line of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.

The Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) prose cycle includes a more elaborate history of the Fisher King. Many in his line are wounded for their failings, and the only two that survived to Arthur&#x27;s day are the Wounded King, named &quot;Pellehan&quot; (&quot;Pellam of Listeneise&quot; in Malory), and the Fisher King, &quot;Pelles&quot;. Pelles engineers the birth of Galahad by tricking Lancelot into bed with his daughter Elaine, and it is prophesied that Galahad will achieve the Grail and heal the Wasteland and the Maimed King. Galahad is conceived when Elaine gets Dame Brisen to use magic to trick Lancelot into thinking that he is coming to visit Guinevere. So Lancelot sleeps with Elaine, thinking her Guinevere, but flees when he realizes what he has done. Galahad is raised by his aunt in a convent, and when he is eighteen, comes to King Arthur&#x27;s court and begins the Grail Quest. Only he, Percival, and Bors are virtuous enough to achieve the Grail and restore Pelles.

In the Post-Vulgate cycle and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the Fisher King&#x27;s wound was given to him by Sir Balin in the &quot;Dolorous Stroke&quot;, when Balin grabs a spear and stabs Pellam in self-defense. However, the spear is the Spear of Longinus, the lance that pierced Christ&#x27;s side, and Pellam and his land must suffer for its misuse until the coming of Galahad. The Dolorous Stroke is typically represented as divine vengeance for a sin on the part of its recipient. The nature of Pellam&#x27;s sin is not stated explicitly, though he at least tolerates his murderous brother Garlon, who slays knights while under cover of invisibility, apparently at random.

King Pelles is the Maimed King, one of a line of Grail keepers established by Joseph of Arimathea, and the father of Eliazer and Elaine (the mother of Galahad). He resides in the castle of Corbinec in Listenois. Pelles and his relative Pellehan appear in both the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate cycles and in later works, such as Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (in which Pellehan is called Pellam). In the Vulgate, Pelles is the son of Pellehan, but the Post-Vulgate is less clear about their relationship. It is even murkier in Malory&#x27;s work: one passage explicitly identifies them (book XIII, chapter 5), though this is contradicted elsewhere.

In all, there are four characters (some of whom can probably be identified with each other) who fill the role of Fisher King or Wounded King in Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

# King Pellam, wounded by Balin (as in the Post-Vulgate). In the Vulgate&#x27;s clearer Grail lineage, Pelles is the son of Pellehan and is wounded in a separate accident, while in the Post-Vulgate Pelles and Pellehan are brothers. The further step of mistaking them as the same character is understandable; Malory confuses the brothers Ywain and Ywain the Bastard, whom he eventually regards as the same character, after treating them as separate.
# King Pelles, grandfather of Galahad, described as &quot;the maimed king&quot;. In one passage, he is explicitly identified with Pellam; in another, he is said to have suffered his wound under different circumstances.
# King &quot;Pescheour &quot;(or &quot;Petchere&quot;), lord of the Grail Castle, who never appears (at least, not under that name). He owes his existence to a mistake by Malory, who took the Old French &quot;roy Peschour&quot; (&quot;Fisher King&quot;, a phrase that Malory never otherwise uses) for a name rather than an epithet. Nevertheless, Malory treats him as distinct from Pelles.
# An anonymous, bedridden Maimed King, healed by Galahad at the climax of the Grail Quest. He is distinct from Pelles, who has just been sent out of the room, and who is, anyway, at least mobile.

In addition, there is King Pellinore, who is Percival&#x27;s father. (In other versions of the legend, Percival is related to the Pelles family). It appears that Malory intended to have one Maimed King who was wounded by Balin and suffered until healed by his grandson Galahad, but he never successfully reconciled his sources.

==Themes==

===Fisher King&#x27;s injury===
The injury is a common theme in the telling of the Grail Quest. While the details and location of the injury vary, the injury ultimately represents the inability of the Fisher King to produce an heir. Although some iterations have two kings present, one or both are injured, most commonly in the thigh. The wound is sometimes presented as a punishment, usually for philandering. In &quot;Parzival&quot;, specifically, the king is injured by the bleeding lance as punishment for taking a wife, which was against the code of the &quot;Grail Guardians&quot;. In some early storylines Percival asks the Fisher King the healing question, which cures the wound. The nature of the question differs between &quot;Perceval&quot; and &quot;Parzival&quot;, but the central theme is that the Fisher King can be healed only if Percival asks &quot;the question&quot;.

The location of the wound is significant to the legend. In most medieval stories, the mention of a wound in the groin or more commonly the &quot;thigh&quot; (such as the wounding of the ineffective suitor in &quot;Lanval&quot; from the &quot;Lais of Marie de France&quot;) is a euphemism for the physical loss of or grave injury to one&#x27;s genitalia. In medieval times, acknowledging the actual type of wound was considered to rob a man of his dignity, thus the use of the substitute terms &quot;groin&quot; or &quot;thigh&quot;, although any informed medieval listener or reader would have known exactly the real nature of the wound. Such a wound was considered worse than actual death because it signaled the end of a man&#x27;s ability to function in his primary purpose: to propagate his line. In the instance of the Fisher King, the wound negates his ability to honor his sacred charge.

===Christianized forms===
Most of the Grail romances do not differ much from &quot;Parzival&quot; and &quot;Perceval&quot;. That being said, there are two interesting exceptions to this case. The two pieces that hold particularly stronger Christian themed deviations than prior works are the &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot; and the &quot;Sone de Nausay&quot;. The &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot; is heavily Christianized not only in terms of the tone but also the characters and significant objects. The Grail maidens become angels, there is a constant relationship between the knights and religious symbolism; most importantly, the Fisher King is replicated as a priest-like figure. In the case of &quot;Sone de Nausay&quot;, Bron (the Fisher King) is part of a tale in which the story makes a constant correlation between the Gospel narrative and the history of the Grail.

===Bleeding lance===
The bleeding lance has taken numerous forms throughout the Arthurian literature chronology. In the earlier appearances of the lance, it is not represented as a Christian symbol, but morphs into one over time. In &quot;Perceval&quot; and &quot;Parzival&quot;, the lance is described as having &quot;barbaric properties&quot; which are difficult to associate with Christian influence. Chrétien describes his lance with &quot;marvelous destructive powers&quot;, which holds a closer connection to the malignant weapons of Celtic origin. In Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Perceval&quot;, the lance takes on a dark and almost evil persona and also seems to overshadow the Grail, which, were this a Christian story, would be rather odd. Wolfram&#x27;s tale also treated the lance in a similar dark manner. In &quot;Parzival&quot;, the lance is &quot;poisonous&quot; which contrasts sharply with the general trend of healing Christian themes. This lance is plunged into the Fisher King&#x27;s wound at different times to continue his pain, as punishment for having sought forbidden love. This lance is considered significant because it is most often associated directly with the wound of the Fisher King, which is demonstrated both in Chrétien&#x27;s and Eschenbach&#x27;s versions of the tale.

The more recent writings have the lance presented in the Fisher King&#x27;s castle with Christian theology. More specifically, it is supposed to be the lance that pierced Jesus Christ while on the cross. This is seen in Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In Malory&#x27;s version, the Fisher King is healed with the blood from the lance, signifying it as a good, holy, Christian object. In &quot;Corbenic&quot; we see the procession at the Fisher King&#x27;s feast, featuring heavily on the Holy Grail, which is a strong Christian artifact. It can be extrapolated that in the same procession, the accompanying lance is the lance that pierced Jesus Christ.

===Sword===
The sword is commonly thought to be a gift from the Fisher King to Perceval. This is then followed by Perceval&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s prophecy that the sword will break at a crucial moment. In two cases, the writers tell us that Perceval broke the sword: in Eschenbach, it fails him in his battle against his half-brother at the end of &quot;Parzival&quot;; and Gerbert de Montreuil describes how he shatters it on the gates of the &quot;Earthly Paradise&quot;. The adventure of the broken sword is a theme originally introduced by Chrétien, who intended it as a symbol of Perceval&#x27;s imperfections as a knight. The major example for his imperfection is that Perceval refused to ask about the Grail. This concept of punishment is also seen in Eschenbach&#x27;s tale where Perceval is told: &quot;your uncle gave you a sword, too, by which you have been granted since your eloquent mouth unfortunately voiced no question there.&quot; The sword remains as a plot device to both remind Perceval of how he failed to ask the healing question and as a physical reminder of the existence of &quot;Munsalvaesche&quot; (Eschenbach&#x27;s name for Corbenic).

<text>The American bulldog is a large, muscular breed of mastiff-type dog. Their ancestors were brought to the British North American colonies where they worked on small farms and ranches. 

== History ==
Dog breeds defined to any standard only came into being with the rise of kennel clubs and breed registries. This happened in the United States in 1884. Before this, no records were kept and instead of breeds, there were informal landrace strains that initially depended on where a dog&#x27;s parent or master originated. 

Dogs resembling bulldogs in England were first mentioned by the ancient Romans as &quot;pugnaces Britanniae.&quot; The vocabulary used to describe dogs has changed over time, but these are believed to be the ancestors of the alaunt and the later bulldog. Dogs had been used since the 13th century in bull-baiting, but the first known mention of bulldogs by name is not found until a seventeenth-century letter requesting them to be sent from London to St. Sebastian, Spain. Different strains of English bulldogs were developed for cattle-droving, bull-baiting, farm dogs, and butcher&#x27;s dogs. They found their way to the North American British colonies as working dogs, where smaller farm and ranch owners used them for many tasks, including farm guardians, stock dogs, and catch dogs. Cynographia Britannica defined the physical and behavioral characteristics of the bulldog in print in 1800. In 1835, bull-baiting was banned in the United Kingdom and breeders there minimized the aggressive, athletic traits of the breed. This ban was not in effect in the United States; however bull-baiting lost popularity as a form of entertainment, contributing to the rarity of the dogs. 

Breeding decisions for the majority of these American dogs were based on temperament and work abilities as farm dogs instead of bloodline. Eventually, several separate dog strains of the bulldog-type were kept by ranchers as utilitarian dogs working to catch cattle and kill predatory wildlife that threatened farm property. Following World War II, this type of dog was on the verge of extinction. The few surviving dogs were kept primarily on farms in the southeastern US. John D. Johnson and Alan Scott are widely regarded as rescuing the landrace from extinction. Johnson scoured the backroads of the South, looking for the best specimens to revive it. During this time, the young Alan Scott became interested in Johnson&#x27;s dogs and began to work with him on his revitalization project. At some point, Scott began breeding bulldogs from working Southern farms with Johnson&#x27;s lines, creating what is now known as the &quot;Standard&quot; or &quot;Scott&quot;-type American Bulldog. At another point, Johnson began crossing his original lines with an English bulldog from the northern UK that had maintained its pre-ban genetic athletic vigor, creating the &quot;Bully&quot; type American Bulldog, also known as the &quot;Johnson&quot; type or the &quot;Classic&quot; type. On January 1, 1999, the United Kennel Club first recognized the American Bulldog as a breed. In November 2019, the breed was added to the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service (FSS). 

The American Bully is an entirely separate breed that evolved from the American Pitbull Terrier mixed with the American Bulldog, English Bulldog, and Olde English Bulldogge. The United Kennel Club recognized it as such on July 15, 2013.

== Appearance ==

The American Bulldog is a stocky and heavily built dog with a large head and a muscular shoulders and forearms. Its coat is short and generally smooth, requiring little maintenance except a bath every few weeks. The breed is a light-to-moderate shedder. Colors, while historically predominantly white with patches of red, black, or brindle, have grown in recent years to include many color patterns, including black, red, brown, fawn, and all shades of brindle. Black pigmentation on the nose and eye rims is traditionally preferred, with only some pink allowed. Eye color is usually brown, but heterochromia also occurs, although this is also considered a cosmetic fault. American Bulldogs are known to drool more than other breeds of dogs. The Bully type is generally a larger, heavier dog with a shorter muzzle, but the muzzle should never be so short that it causes difficulty with breathing. Standard types are generally more athletic, with longer muzzles and a more square head. Many modern American Bulldogs are a combination of the two types, usually termed &quot;hybrid&quot;. In general, American Bulldogs weigh between and are at the withers, but have been known to greatly exceed these dimensions, especially in the &quot;out of standard&quot; nonworking stock.

== Health ==

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) has been identified in some American Bulldogs. 

The American Bulldog is predisposed to the following dermatological conditions: allergic skin disease, ichthyosis, solar dermatosis, and squamous cell carcinoma.

A review of patient records in the US from over 600 hospitals found the American Bulldog to be predisposed to juvenile-onset demodicosis with a 3.4 odds ratio.

==In popular culture==
*In &quot;Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil&quot; (2010), Jangers, Tyler Labine&#x27;s character&#x27;s dog, is played by an American Bulldog named Weezer.
*An American Bulldog features prominently as the titular character&#x27;s companion in the 2013 film &quot;Joe&quot;.
*The company logo for Zynga featured an American Bulldog, and was named after Mark Pincus’ dog &quot;Zinga&quot;.

<text>General practice is personal, family, and community-orientated comprehensive primary care that includes diagnosis, continues over time and is anticipatory as well as responsive.

==Definitions==

A general practitioner (GP) is a doctor who is a consultant in the discipline of general practice. GPs have distinct expertise and experience in providing whole person medical care whilst managing the complexity, uncertainty and risk associated with the continuous care they provide. GPs work at the heart of their communities, striving to provide comprehensive and equitable care for everyone, taking into account their health care needs, stage of life and background. GPs work in, connect with and lead multidisciplinary teams that care for people and their families, respecting the context in which they live, aiming to ensure all of their physical health and mental health needs are met.

General practice is an academic and scientific discipline with its own educational content, research, evidence base and clinical activity. Characteristics that define the discipline of general practice are: 
* person centredness
* continuity of care
* comprehensiveness
* whole person care
* diagnostic and therapeutic skill
* coordination and clinical teamwork
* continuous quality improvement
* professional, clinical and ethical standards
* leadership, advocacy and equity
* continuing evolution of the speciality.

The general practice model is used in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, India and South Africa. In some countries, such as the United States, similar services may be described as family medicine or primary care. The term primary care may include services provided by GPs, community nursing, allied health, pharmacy, optometrist, dentistry, and community hearing care providers. The balance of care between primary care and secondary care - which usually refers to hospital based services - varies from place to place. In many countries there are initiatives to move services out of hospitals into the community, in the expectation that this will be cost-effective and be more convenient.

==Ireland==
In Ireland there are about 2,500 General Practitioners working in group practices, primary care centres, single practices and health centres.

== Australia ==
General Practice services in Australia are funded under the Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) which is a public health insurance scheme. Australians need a referral from the GP to be able to access specialist care. Most general practitioners work in a general practitioner practice, supported by practice nurses and administrative staff. Often other health professionals such as allied health practitioners en pharmacists are part of general practice teams to provide an integrated multidisciplinary healthcare team to deliver primary care.

==United Kingdom==
The pattern of services in the UK was largely established by the National Insurance Act 1911 which established the list system which came from the friendly societies across the country. Every patient was entitled to be on the list, or panel of a general practitioner. In 1911 that only applied to those who paid National insurance contributions. In 1938 43% of the adult population was covered by a panel doctor. When the National Health Service was established in 1948 this extended to the whole population. The practice would be responsible for the patient record and would be transferred if necessary to another practice if the patient changed practice. In the UK, unlike many other countries, patients do not normally have direct access to hospital consultants and the GP controls access to secondary care.
Most services are provided under the General Medical Services Contract, which is regularly revised.

In 1953, general practitioners were estimated to be making between 12 and 30 home visits each day and seeing between 15 and 50 patients in their surgeries. In 2019 according to NHS England, almost 90% of salaried GPs were working part-time.

Under the pressure of the Coronavirus epidemic in 2020 general practice shifted very quickly to remote working, something which had been progressing very slowly up to that point. In the Hurley Group Clare Gerada reported that &quot;99% of all our work is now online&quot; using a digital triage system linked to the patient&#x27;s electronic patient record which processes up to 3000 consultations per hour. Video calling is used to &quot;see&quot; patients if that is needed.

More than 80% of GPs feared patients may be at risk from bad decisions because GPs are overworked and understaffed in March 2022. In September 2022 1.45 million patients waited at least 28 days before seeing a GP. In November 2022 GPs told &quot;The Observer&quot; most days they breach the British Medical Association (BMA) guideline of &quot;not more than 25 contacts per day&quot; to provide safe care. In March 2021 &quot;Pulse&quot; did a survey which revealed GPs were dealing with 37 patients per day on average.

===Premises===

Practices were generally small, often single handed, operating from the doctor&#x27;s home and often with the doctor&#x27;s wife acting as a receptionist. When the NHS was established in 1948 there were plans for the building of health centres, but few were built. The British Medical Association in 2019 conducted a survey for GP premises. About half of the 1,011 respondents thought their surgeries were not suitable for present needs, and 78% said they would not be able to handle expected future demands.

==== Number and size of practices ====
599 GP practices closed between 2010–11 and 2014–15, while 91 opened and average practice list size increased from 6,610 to 7,171. In 2016 there were 7,613 practices in England, 958 in Scotland, 454 in Wales and 349 in Northern Ireland. There were 7435 practices in England and the average practice list size in June 2017 was 7,860. There were 1.35 million patients over 85. There has been a great deal of consolidation into larger practices, especially in England. Lakeside Healthcare was the largest practice in England in 2014, with 62 partners and more than 100,000 patients. Maintaining general practices in isolated communities has become very challenging, and calls on very different skills and behaviour from that required in large practices where there is increasing specialisation. By 1 October 2018, 47 GP practices in England had a list size of 30,000 or more and the average list size had reached 8,420. In 2019 the average number of registered patients per GP in England has risen since 2018 by 56 to 2,087.

===England===
In 2004, regulations were changed in Labour government reforms to allow new entrants, including commercial companies, to operate one or more general practices, named Alternative Provider Medical Services. Research in 2015 found that 4% of general practices were being run under these new arrangements, but they had not made improvements in the quality of service though they often operated in more deprived populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SO2004/291&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The GP Forward View, published by NHS England in 2016 promised £2.4 billion (14%) real-terms increase in the budget for general practice. Jeremy Hunt pledged to increase the number of doctors working in general practice by 5,000. There are 3,250 trainee places available in 2017. The GP Career Plus scheme is intended to retain GPs aged over 55 in the profession by providing flexible roles such as providing cover, carrying out specific work such as managing long-term conditions, or doing home visits. In July Simon Stevens announced a programme designed to recruit around 2,000 GPs from the EU and possibly New Zealand and Australia. According to NHS Improvement a 1% deterioration in access to general practice can produce a 10% deterioration in emergency department figures.

GPs are increasingly employing pharmacists to manage the increasingly complex medication regimes of an aging population. In 2017 more than 1,061 practices were employing pharmacists, following the rollout of NHS England&#x27;s Clinical Pharmacists in General Practice programme. There are also moves to employ care navigators, sometimes an enhanced role for a receptionist, to direct patients to different services such as pharmacy and physiotherapy if a doctor is not needed. In September 2017 270 trained care navigators covering 64,000 patients had been employed across Wakefield. It was estimated that they had saved 930 GP hours over a 10-month trial.

Four NHS trusts: Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust; Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust; and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust have taken over multiple GP practices in the interests of integration. In March 2022 Sajid Javid supported a report by Policy Exchange which described the existing general practice model as &quot;outdated&quot;. He is said to be &quot;considering radical changes to the 70-year-old structure of the NHS that could see many family doctors directly employed by hospitals instead of running their own surgeries.&quot;

GP Federations have become popular among English General practitioners.

====Consultations====
According to the Local Government Association 57 million GP consultations in England in 2015 were for minor conditions and illnesses, 5.2 million of them for blocked noses. According to the King&#x27;s Fund between 2014 and 2017 the number of telephone and face-to-face contacts between patients and GPs rose by 7.5% although GP numbers have stagnated. The mean consultation length in the UK has increased steadily over time from around 5 minutes in the 1950s to around 9·22 minutes in 2013–2014. This is shorter than the mean consultation length in a number of other developed countries around the world.

The proportion of patients in England waiting longer than seven days to see a GP rose from 12.8% in 2012 to 20% in 2017. There were 307 million GP appointments, about a million each working day, with more on Mondays, in the year from November 2017. 40% got a same-day appointment. 2.8 million patients, 10.3%, in October 2018, compared to 9.4% in November 2017, did not see the doctor until at least 21 days after they had booked their appointment, and 1.4 million waited for more than 28 days. More than a million people each month failed to turn up for their appointment.

Commercial providers are rare in the UK but a private GP service was established at Poole Road Medical Centre in Bournemouth in 2017 where patients can pay to skip waiting lists to see a doctor.

GP at Hand, an online service using Babylon Health&#x27;s app, was launched in November 2017 by the Lillie Road Health Centre, a conventional GP practice in west London. It recruited 7000 new patients in its first month, of which 89.6% were between 20 and 45 years old. The service was widely criticised by GPs for cherry picking. Patients with long term medical conditions or who might need home visits were actively discouraged from joining the service. Richard Vautrey warned that it risked &#x27;undermining the quality and continuity of care and further fragmenting the service provided to the public&#x27;.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom led to a sudden move to remote working. In March 2020 the proportion of telephone appointments increased by over 600%.

===Patient satisfaction===
85% of patients rate their overall experience of primary care as good in 2016, but practices run by limited companies operating on APMS contracts (a small minority) performed worse on four out of five key indicators - frequency of consulting a preferred doctor, ability to get a convenient appointment, rating of doctor communication skills, ease of contacting the practice by telephone and overall experience.

===Northern Ireland===
There have been particularly acute problems in general practice in Northern Ireland as it has proved very difficult to recruit doctors in rural practices. The British Medical Association collected undated resignation letters in 2017 from GPs who threatened to leave the NHS and charge consultation fees. They demanded increased funding, more recruitment and improved computer systems.

A new GP contract was announced in June 2018 by the Northern Ireland Department of Health. It included funding for practice-based pharmacists, an extra £1 million for increased indemnity costs, £1.8 million because of population growth, and £1.5 million for premises upgrades.

<doc id="644055" wikidata="Q45709" url="?curid=644055" title="Prayer of Saint Francis">
<text>The anonymous text that is usually called the Prayer of Saint Francis (or Peace Prayer, or Simple Prayer for Peace, or Make us an Instrument of Your Peace) is a widely known Christian prayer for peace. Often associated with the Italian Saint Francis of Assisi ( – 1226), but entirely absent from his writings, the prayer in its present form has not been traced back further than 1912. Its first known occurrence was in French, in a small spiritual magazine called &quot;La Clochette&quot; (The Little Bell), published by a Catholic organization in Paris named &quot;La Ligue de la Sainte-Messe&quot; (The League of the Holy Mass). The author&#x27;s name was not given, although it may have been the founder of &quot;La Ligue,&quot; Father Esther Bouquerel. The prayer was heavily publicized during both World War I and World War II. It has been frequently set to music by notable songwriters and quoted by prominent leaders, and its broadly inclusive language has found appeal with many faiths encouraging service to others.

==Text==
In most published versions of the prayer, the text is abridged, paraphrased or copyrighted. Below is the complete original text from its earliest known publication (1912, in French, copyright expired), alongside a line-by-line English translation:
===Possible inspirations for the prayer===
The second half of the prayer bears a strong resemblance to this famous saying of Giles of Assisi (c. 1190 – 1262), one of Francis&#x27;s closest companions:
This text appears in the last chapters of the famous Little Flowers of St. Francis, a text that was undergoing numerous translations at the time the modern prayer was composed. At face value Giles&#x27;s verses appear to be heavily inspired by an earlier text themselves, both in structure and content, namely The Beatitudes of Jesus in Matthew 5:3-12 and Luke 6:20-26.

The first half of the prayer also bears some similarities to Veni Sancte Spiritus in both structure and content.

===Franciscan viewpoints===
The Franciscan Order does not include the prayer in its official &quot;Prayers of St. Francis&quot;, and a church historian has noted that the phrasing of the first half of the text (&quot;let me...&quot;) is atypically self-oriented for Francis: However, the prayer has been recommended by members of the Order, while not attributing it to Saint Francis.

==Musical settings==
===Sebastian Temple (1967)===

The most-prominent hymn version of the prayer is &quot;Make Me a Channel of Your Peace&quot;, or simply &quot;Prayer of St. Francis&quot;, adapted and set to a chant-like melody in 1967 by South African songwriter Sebastian Temple (born Johann Sebastian von Tempelhoff, 1928–1997), who had become a Third Order Franciscan. The hymn is an anthem of the Royal British Legion and is usually sung at its annual Festival of Remembrance. In 1997, it was part of the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, and was performed by the Irish singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor on the Princess Diana tribute album. The hymn was also sung for the religious wedding ceremony of Prince Albert II of Monaco to South African Charlene Wittstock in 2011.

===Others===
Additional settings of the prayer by notable musicians include those by:
* Arthur Bliss
* Maire Brennan
* The Burns Sisters
* F. R. C. Clarke
* René Clausen
* Bing Crosby – recorded 4 November 1954 for the cause of Junípero Serra. 
* Donovan
* Dream Theater
* Petr Eben
* John Foley
* Marc Jordan
* Singh Kaur
* Snatam Kaur
* Matt Maher
* Mary McDonald
* Sarah McLachlan
* A Ragamuffin Band
* John Rutter
* Patti Smith
* John Michael Talbot
==History==
Christian Renoux, a history professor at the University of Orléans, published in French in 2001 a book-length study of the prayer and its origins, clearing up much of the confusion that had accumulated previously. The Franciscan journal &quot;Frate Francesco&quot; and the Vatican newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; published articles in Italian summarizing the book&#x27;s findings, and Renoux published an online abstract in English at The Franciscan Archive.

===&quot;La Clochette&quot; (1912)===
The earliest known record of the prayer is its appearance, as a &quot;beautiful prayer to say during Mass&quot;, in the December 1912 issue of the small devotional French Catholic publication &quot;La Clochette&quot;, &quot;the bulletin of the League of the Holy Mass&quot;. Although the prayer was published anonymously, Renoux concluded that, with few exceptions, the texts in &quot;La Clochette&quot; were generally written by its founding editor, Father Esther Bouquerel (1855–1923).

===Mistaken attribution (1916) to 11th-century William the Conqueror===

In 1915, Marquis Stanislas de La Rochethulon (1862–1945), founding president of the Anglo-French association &quot;Souvenir Normand&quot; (Norman Remembrance), which called itself &quot;a work of peace and justice inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror, who is considered to be the ancestor of all the royal families of Europe&quot;, sent this prayer to Pope Benedict XV in the midst of World War I. The Pope had an Italian translation published on the front page of &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; on 20 January 1916. It appeared under the heading, &quot;The prayers of &#x27;Souvenir Normand&#x27; for peace&quot;, with a jumbled explanation: &quot;&#x27;Souvenir Normand&#x27; has sent the Holy Father the text of some prayers for peace. We have pleasure in presenting in particular the prayer addressed to the Sacred Heart, inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror.&quot; On 28 January 1916, the newspaper &quot;La Croix&quot; reprinted, in French, the article from &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, with exactly the same heading and explanation. La Rochethulon wrote to &quot;La Croix&quot; to clarify that it was not a prayer of &quot;Souvenir Normand&quot;; but he failed to mention &quot;La Clochette&quot;, the first publication in which it had appeared. Because of its appearance in &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; and &quot;La Croix&quot; as a simple prayer for peace during World War I, the prayer became widely known.

===Mistaken attribution (c. 1927) to 13th-century Saint Francis===
Around 1918, Franciscan Father Étienne Benoît reprinted the &quot;Prayer for Peace&quot; in French, without attribution, on the back of a mass-produced holy card depicting his Order&#x27;s founder, the inspirational peacemaker from the Crusades era, Saint Francis of Assisi. The prayer was circulating in the United States by January 1927, when its first known English version (slightly abridged from the 1912 French original) appeared in the Quaker magazine &quot;Friends&#x27; Intelligencer&quot;, under the misattributed and misspelled title &quot;A prayer of St. Francis of Assissi&quot;. The saint&#x27;s namesake American archbishop and military vicar Francis Spellman distributed millions of copies of the &quot;Prayer of St. Francis&quot; during World War II, and the next year it was read into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; by Senator Albert W. Hawkes. As a friar later summarized the relationship between the prayer and St. Francis: &quot;One can safely say that although he is not the author, it resembles him and would not have displeased him.&quot;

==Other notable invocations==
The Prayer of St. Francis has often been cited with national or international significance, in the spirit of service to others.

===By religious leaders===

In 1986, Pope John Paul II recited the prayer as a means of bidding farewell to the global religious leaders he hosted for the first &quot;World Day of Prayer for Peace&quot;, in Assisi at the Basilica of St. Francis. Indeed, the prayer &quot;over the years has gained a worldwide popularity with people of all faiths&quot;.

Mother Teresa of Calcutta (Kolkata, India) made it part of the morning prayers of the Roman Catholic religious institute she founded, the Missionaries of Charity. She attributed importance to the prayer when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo in 1979 and asked that it be recited. It became the anthem of many Christian schools in Kolkata. South Africa&#x27;s Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent leadership against apartheid, declared that the prayer was &quot;an integral part&quot; of his devotions.

===By political leaders===
Margaret Thatcher, after winning the 1979 general election, paraphrased the prayer on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street, surrounded by a throng of reporters, having &quot;kissed hands&quot; with Queen Elizabeth II and become Prime Minister.

In 1995, US President Bill Clinton quoted it in his welcoming remarks to John Paul II, starting the papal visit to address the United Nations in New York City. Nancy Pelosi quoted the prayer when she became Speaker of the US House of Representatives in 2007, as did her successor John Boehner when he resigned in 2015. Pelosi invoked it again at the opening of the evening House session following the 6 January 2021, riot and storming of the Capitol. At the 2012 Democratic Convention, Jena Nardella invoked the prayer during the closing Benediction. President-elect Joe Biden quoted the prayer during his speech following his victory in the Electoral College on 14 December 2020.

===By others===
The prayer is referenced in the Alcoholics Anonymous book &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot; (1953), and is often known to AA members as the &quot;Step Eleven Prayer&quot;. An abbreviated version of the prayer was sung in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1972 film about St. Francis, &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot;. In &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001), episode six &quot;Bastogne&quot;, Eugene &#x27;Doc&#x27; Roe recites &quot;Lord, grant that I shall never seek so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, or to be loved as to love with all my heart. With all my heart.&quot; while praying in a foxhole in the Bois Jacques. A modified segment of the prayer is recited in one of the early trailers for the Sylvester Stallone 2008 film &quot;Rambo&quot;. A modified version of the prayer appears in the song &quot;Prayer&quot; in the musical &quot;Come From Away&quot;. Beanie Feldstein sings the prayer in the 2017 movie &quot;Lady Bird&quot;, set at a Catholic girls&#x27; school. A shortened version appears in the HBO show &quot;Deadwood&quot;, episode 11, season one, and in the Showtime series &quot;The Affair&quot;, episode 8, season one. And also appears in the CBC TV series &quot;Anne with an E&quot;, episode 3, season three.

Sinéad O&#x27;Connor recorded a version for the 1997 &quot;Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute&quot; album.

According to singer and guitarist Trey Anastasio from the American rock band Phish, recital of the Saint Francis prayer is an integral part of his pre-concert ritual.

<doc id="644056" wikidata="Q6239920" url="?curid=644056" title="John Horsley (antiquarian)">
<text>John Horsley FRS (1685 – 12 January 1732) was a British antiquarian, known primarily for his book &quot;Britannia Romana&quot; or &quot;The Roman Antiquities of Britain&quot; which was published in 1732.

==Early life==
John Hodgson, in a memoir published in 1831, held that Horsley was born in 1685, at Pinkie House, in the parish of Inveresk, Midlothian, and that his father was a Northumberland nonconformist, who had migrated to Scotland, but returned to England soon after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. John Hodgson Hinde, in the &quot;Archaeologia Aeliana&quot; of February 1865, held that he was a native of Newcastle-on-Tyne, the son of Charles Horsley, a member of the Tailors&#x27; Company of the town. David Boyd Haycock writing in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; comments that none of the suggestions made for Horsley&#x27;s background is verifiable.

He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle and at Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA on 29 April 1701. There is evidence that he &quot;was settled in Morpeth as a Presbyterian minister as early as 1709.&quot; Hodgson, however, thought that up to 1721, at which time he was residing at Widdrington, &quot;he had not received ordination, but preached as a licentiate.&quot;

==Educator==
Horsley communicated to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; notes on the rainfall at Widdrington in the years 1722 and 1723. At Morpeth Horsley opened a private school, attracting pupils irrespective of religious connection, among them Newton Ogle, later dean of Winchester. He gave lectures on mechanics and hydrostatics in Morpeth, Alnwick and Newcastle, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 23 April 1730, or in May, 1729.

==Death==
Horsley died of apoplexy on 12 January 1732, on the eve of the publication of the &quot;Britannia Romana&quot;, and was buried in Morpeth.

==Family==

He married Anne Hamilton daughter of Rev William Hamilton, minister of Cramond near Edinburgh and later Principal of Edinburgh University.

==Works==
It is as an archaeologist and antiquarian that Horsley is now known. His major work, &quot;Britannia Romana&quot;, or &quot;The Roman Antiquities of Britain&quot; was published in 1732. One of Horsley&#x27;s achievements in this book was to identify for the first time which legions of the Roman army were stationed in Britain. There was in the British Museum a copy with notes by John Ward.

He also published two sermons and a handbook to his lectures on mechanics, etc., and projected a history of Northumberland and Durham, collections for which were found among his papers.

It is thought to contain some of the best modern representations of the original flora and fauna of Gondwana, one of the reasons for its listing as a World Heritage site.

==Description==

Te Wahipounamu stretches along the western coastline of the South Island of New Zealand. The elevation of this land area ranges from sea level to at Aoraki / Mount Cook. In some places it extends inland as far as . Within Te Wahipounamu there is a multitude of natural features including snow-capped peaks, sapphire lakes, waterfalls, fiords, and valleys. It is also home to hundreds of the world&#x27;s most active glaciers, but the main two are Franz Josef Glacier and Fox Glacier. It is the largest and least modified area of New Zealand&#x27;s natural ecosystem. And as such, the flora and fauna of the area is the world&#x27;s best modern representation of the ancient biota of Gondwanaland.

===Flora===

The vegetation in Te Wahipounamu is diverse and in essentially pristine condition. On the mountains there is a rich alpine vegetation of shrubs, tussocks and herbs. The warmer and lower altitude rainforests are dominated by tall podocarps. There are more rainforests and wetlands in the west, and the most extensive and least modified natural freshwater wetlands in New Zealand are found in this area. The Westland coastal plain is characterised by its high-fertility swamps and low-fertility peat bogs.

===Fauna===
Te Wahipounamu is home to many indigenous animals and contains the largest and most significant population of forest birds in the country. The total wild population of the takahē, which is only about 170 birds, is found in a few mountain valleys in Fiordland. Along the south-west coast, most of New Zealand&#x27;s Fur Seals are found. Also found in this region are Southern Brown Kiwi, Great Spotted Kiwi, Yellow-crowned parakeet, Fiordland Penguin, New Zealand Falcon, and Brown teal. The kākāpō, the world&#x27;s rarest and heaviest parrot, was found in this region until the early 1980s. It is now believed that it is extinct on the mainland.

===Population===
The Te Wahipounamu area is the least populated part of New Zealand. Most residents work in tourism related jobs but there are other land use occupations. On the coast residents engage in fishing, grazing, and small-scale mining. In the eastern part of the World Heritage area pastoralism is the main land use. Sheep and cattle grazing is permitted under license or lease, although designation of Te Wahipounamu as a World Heritage site has limited the lands available for these practices.

===Land formations===
Te Wahipounamu is one of the most seismically active regions in the world. It lies across the boundary of two plates, the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate. The mountains in the area are a result of tectonic movements over the last five million years. Glaciers are also a major feature of the area. Their basic pattern was set during the Pleistocene glaciations although there have been substantial post-glacial changes. These changes are greater in the Southern Alps than in the Fiordlands. Typical changes include intense gullying, serrated ridges, and major and minor rockfalls. Landslides, although not frequent, are a potential hazard of the region. Even with the low density of settlements and transport corridors, there is the potential occurrence of landslides in the vicinity of tourist infrastructure in the Southern Alps.

==Māori connections to the land==

The entire region of Te Wahipounamu is of deep significance to Māori, in particular the Ngāi Tahu iwi, whose &quot;rohe&quot; (traditional area of control) covers the majority of the South Island.

===Legend===
The legend as to the formation of this region and the South Island is as follows. Te Wahipounamu was formed when the four sons of Rakinui, the Sky Father, descended from the heavens and set out on a voyage around Papatūānuku, the Earth Mother. During this voyage their canoe hit a reef and the brothers found themselves stranded. An icy wind from the Tasman Sea froze them into stone and their canoe became the South Island of New Zealand. The tallest of the brothers was Aoraki and he is now Aoraki Mt. Cook while his brothers and the other crewmembers form the rest of the Southern Alps.

The Māori also have a legend for the formation of Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers. This legend begins with Hinehukatere who loved climbing in the mountains. One day she persuaded her lover, Tawe, to join her. An avalanche killed Tawe and he came to rest in Fox Glacier. The traditional Māori name for the glacier is Te Moeke o Tauwe, which means the bed of Tauwe. After Tauwe&#x27;s death, Hinehukatere was heartbroken and cried so many tears. These tears froze to form Franz Josef Glacier. The Maori name for Franz Josef Glacier is Ka Roimata o Hinehukatere which means the tears of Hinehukatere.

===Use of Region===

The area was, and continues to be, an important source of pounamu greenstone or jade. This precious stone is used for making Maori tools, weapons, and jewelry.

==UNESCO World Heritage Site==
Te Wahipounamu was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1990. The Westland and Mount Cook National Park and the Fiordland National Park were previously inscribed on the list, but are now considered under Te Wahipounamu, which covers all of these areas. To be inscribed on this list, Te Wahipounamu met several criteria. It contains many of the natural features that contribute to New Zealand&#x27;s reputation as a place with exceptional landscapes. It is considered the best modern example of the biota of Gondwanaland and is therefore of global significance. There is a high degree of geodiversity and biodiversity and the habitats are largely unmodified. And finally, there is an extensive range of New Zealand&#x27;s unusual flora and fauna, which demonstrate its evolutionary isolation.

==Protection and management==

===Legal requirements===
Most of the land in Te Wahipounamu is owned by the Crown (government and the people of New Zealand) and administered by the Department of Conservation. The most important regulations are the National Parks Act 1980, the Conservation Act 1987, and Reserves Act 1977, which were not made specifically for Te Wahipounamu but apply as they are for all of New Zealand. There is a legislative mandate for the preservation and protection of natural and historic resources to maintain their intrinsic value, provide for their appreciation and recreational enjoyment by the public, and safeguard options of future generations.

===Treaty of Waitangi===
The Treaty of Waitangi grants the Ngāi Tahu people prestige and authority over the land. The Department of Conservation is obligated to oblige to the principles of this treaty. This implies a partnership agreement with the Ngāi Tahu people. This partnership involves an annual business planning process with the Ngāi Tahu iwi (the overarching tribal authority), which gives the Ngāi Tahu an opportunity to engage in and contribute to the operational management of the property.

The treaty was not always honoured though, but a settlement was made around the time Te Wahipounamu was declared a World Heritage Area. The implications of this settlement were threefold. First Mount Cook became Aoraki / Mount Cook and 88 other topographic features were agreed to have dual Māori/English names. Secondly, the title for Aoraki was returned to the Ngāi Tahu Tribe who then in turn gifted it to the people of New Zealand. And finally the Tribe was given rights of access and temporary occupancy for the gathering of traditional foods and materials.

===Management planning framework===
There are four main planning entities for developing the management framework for the wilderness resources of the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage Area. The first entity is legislation. New Zealand does not have any legislation specific to the World Heritage Site and therefore Te Wahipounamu is managed under the previously mentioned legislation (National Parks Act, Conservation Act, Reserves Act). The second entity is visitor strategy. The Department of Conservation manages all sites within Te Wahipounamu under the Visitor Strategy. This strategy divides visitors into seven groups based on the length of their stay and the type of activities they seek. It then provides quality recreational opportunities for these groups and facilities when appropriate. The third entity is conservation management strategies. These are documents stating regional conservation and they outline strategic priorities and key sites for biodiversity conservation and visitor recreation. The final planning entity is management plans. Management plans are created for specific sites within Te Wahipounamu. Each National Park has its own management plan.

==Tourism==

The main tourist attractions within Te Wahipounamu are Milford Sound / Piopiotahi and the Milford Track, Lake Te Anau and the Kepler Track, the Routeburn Track and Mount Aspiring / Tititea, Aoraki / Mount Cook and the Haupapa / Tasman, Franz Josef, and Fox Glaciers. There are only two main roads in the region, the Haast Highway and Milford Highway. Along these highways, which are referred to as the “Heritage Highway” corridors, is a network of ten visitor centres and a multitude of nature walks. A main attraction to Te Wahipounamu, and New Zealand in general, is the natural landscape. A study found that key motivating factors for visitors to Te Wahipounamu are the scenery and recreational activities. Tourism within Te Wahipounamu is nature-based, ‘green’ tourism. There is a combination of nature and adventure tourism. There are some strictly nature based tourism activities such as walking in the Natural Parks, whale-watching, and boat tours in the Fiordland Sounds. Then there are activities such as tramping or trekking, which contain adventure components like crossing rivers or mountain passes while enjoying the natural scenery. Even the adventure activities like glacier walks, rafting, and climbing take place in the natural environment.

According to Charnley, this type of nature tourism may not qualify as ecotourism. In her definition of ecotourism, it must have genuine social benefits and serve as a tool for sustainable community development. This requires meeting three conditions. Economic benefits must be structured in a culturally appropriate way that makes them accessible to the target population. For communities to benefit, they need secure land tenure over the area as well as the ability to make land use decisions. And the tourism benefits have to be more than economic, they must promote deeper social and political justice goals. The communities in Te Wahipounamu survive mainly through tourism. Most residents of the region are there because of the tourism employment opportunities. Thus the economic benefits are prevalent, but in most cases there lacks a further cultural or conservational component. Although there are some more historically and culturally based tourism activities and tours available. There is cultural integration among visitors and locals due to the small scale of the facilities but there is less often a link to traditional Maori culture. Conservational efforts are in place in this entire region but they are a result of governmental beliefs and World Heritage designation, they are not a result of the tool of ecotourism. So many people may refer to ecotourism in Te Wahipounamu but whether it truly deserves that title is open to interpretation.

The area is a destination for large cruise ships which do not dock and smaller cruise ships that run local itineraries.

===Wilderness===
Within Te Wahipounamu there are four wilderness areas. These areas are Hooker-Landsborough, which covers 41,000 ha, Olivine (80,000 ha), Pembroke (18,000 ha) and Glaisnock (125,000 ha). Together these wilderness areas make up 10% of the total area of Te Wahipounamu. They are managed strictly in terms of the New Zealand Wilderness Policy. This policy defines wilderness areas as “wildlands that appear to have been affected only by the forces of nature, with any imprint of human interference substantially unnoticeable. Designated wilderness areas are managed to perpetuate their natural condition.” There are no visitor facilities in these areas. No roads, huts, bridges, or even tracks. And there is no air access for recreational or commercial purposes. Visitors enter these areas “on nature&#x27;s terms”.

The wilderness areas perpetuate ideas of purity and nature that have long existed. John Muir and Aldo Leopold advocated for the protection of the American wilderness and wilderness ideas were one of the foundations for the environmental movement in the United States. The New Zealand Wilderness Policy mirrors these ideas with criteria about having this protected land for enjoyment but keeping it virtually untouched by humans. The continuing rise in tourism to New Zealand is affecting this experience though. There are perceptions of crowding on several of the backcountry tramping tracks. This effects and minimizes the desired experience of wilderness and solitude.

==Miscellaneous issues==
There are a variety of issues throughout Te Wahipounamu that still need resolution. They include the following:

The environmental threat of a Haast-Hollyford road, a proposal that has been suggested since the 1870s.

There is a further need to forge a working partnership with the Ngāi Tahu iwi. In principle there is a framework for this partnership but it is a persistent issue to realise the theoretical framework and implement a true partnership.

Due to tourism there is an increase in tourist aircraft. The noise pollution from these aircraft disrupts the “natural quiet” of this region, which many wish to preserve.

Currently the World Heritage Area does not include a marine component. There is a perceived need for better protection of the coastal wilderness.

One of the larger issues the region faces are populations of invasive species. Invasive species have the biggest impact on the region. Population increases of red deer, and other browsing mammals such as wapiti, goat, and fallow deer, have caused severe damage and particularly threaten the integrity of the forest and alpine ecosystems. Commercial hunting has been used as a means of reducing these populations to ecologically acceptable levels. The Department of Conservation has control programs and the National Parks policy is to eradicate new invasions and eradicate or reduce the range of existing invasive species

<text>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is a scientific and professional organization for people working on natural language processing. Its namesake conference is one of the primary high impact conferences for natural language processing research, along with EMNLP. The conference is held each summer in locations where significant computational linguistics research is carried out.

It was founded in 1962, originally named the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL). It became the ACL in 1968. The ACL has a European (EACL), a North American (NAACL), and an Asian (AACL) chapter.

==History==
The ACL was founded in 1962 as the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL). The initial membership was about 100. In 1965, the AMTCL took over the journal &quot;Mechanical Translation and Computational Linguistics&quot;. This journal was succeeded by many other journals: the &quot;American Journal of Computational Linguistics&quot; (1974–1978, 1980–1983), and then &quot;Computational Linguistics&quot; (1984–present). Since 1988, the journal has been published for the ACL by MIT Press.

The annual meeting was first held in 1963 in conjunction with the Association for Computing Machinery National Conference. The annual meeting was, for a long time, relatively informal and did not publish anything longer than abstracts. By 1968, the society took on its current name, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The publication of the annual meeting&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings of the ACL&quot; began in 1979 and gradually matured into its modern form. Many of the meetings were held in conjunction with the Linguistic Society of America, and a few with the American Society for Information Science and the Cognitive Science Society.

The United States government sponsored much research from 1989 to 1994, characterized by an increase in author retention rates and an increase in research in some key topics, such as speech recognition, in ACL. By the 21st century, it was able to maintain authors at a high rate who coalesced in a more stable arrangement around individual research topics.

==Annual Meeting of the ACL==
Every year, the ACL holds the Annual Meeting of the ACL. The location lies in Europe in years zero modulo three, North America in years one modulo three, and Asia–Australia in years two modulo three. In 2020, the Annual Meeting received for the first time more submissions from China than the United States.

==Activities==
The ACL organizes several of the top conferences and workshops in the field of computational linguistics and natural language processing. These include:
* Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the flagship conference of the organization
* Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)
* International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP), held jointly one of the other conferences on a rotating basis
* Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL)
* Lexical and Computational Semantics and Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)
* Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM)
* Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT)

Besides conferences, the ACL also sponsors the journals &quot;Computational Linguistics&quot; and &quot;Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics&quot; (TACL). Papers and other presentations at ACL and ACL-affiliated venues are archived online in the open-access ACL Anthology.

==Special Interest Groups==
ACL has a large number of Special Interest Groups (SIGs), focusing on specific areas of natural language processing. Some current SIGs within ACL are:
==Presidents==

Each year, the ACL elects a distinguished computational linguist who becomes vice-president of the organization in the next calendar year and president one year later. Recent ACL presidents are:

<text>Ragnar Arthur Granit (30 October 1900 – 12 March 1991) was a Finnish-Swedish scientist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1967 along with Haldan Keffer Hartline and George Wald &quot;for their discoveries concerning the primary physiological and chemical visual processes in the eye&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ragnar Arthur Granit was born on 30 October 1900 in Riihimäki, Finland, at the time part of the Russian Empire, into a Swedish-speaking Finnish family. Granit was raised in Oulunkylä, a suburb of the Finnish capital of Helsinki, and attended the Svenska normallyceum in Helsinki.

Granit graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Helsinki in 1927.

==Career and research==
In 1940, when Finland became the target of a massive Soviet attack during the Winter War, Granit sought refuge – and peaceful surroundings for his studies and research work – in Stockholm, the capital of neighbouring Sweden, at the age of 40. In 1941, Granit received Swedish citizenship, which made it possible for him to live and continue with his work without having to worry about the Continuation War, which lasted in Finland until 1944. Granit was proud of his Finnish-Swedish roots and remained a patriotic Finnish-Swede throughout his life, maintaining homes in both Finland and Sweden after the Moscow Armistice ended the Continuation War and secured Finnish independence.

Granit was professor of neurophysiology at the Karolinska Institute from 1946 to his retirement in 1967.

==Awards and honors==
Granit was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1954. In 1960, Granit was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS).

In 1967 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Granit said that he was a &quot;fifty-fifty&quot; Finnish and Swedish Nobel laureate. He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences the following year. In 1971, he was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Death==
Granit died on 12 March 1991 in Stockholm at the age of 90. Granit and his wife Marguerite, who died the same year, were buried in a church cemetery on the Finnish island of Korpo.

<text>Wilhelm Bauer (; 23 December 1822 – 20 June 1875) was a German marine engineer who built several hand-powered submarines.

==Biography==
Wilhelm Bauer was born in Dillingen in the Kingdom of Bavaria. His father was a sergeant in a Bavarian cavalry regiment. After an apprenticeship as a wood turner, Bauer also joined the army. Working as an artillery engineer, he witnessed the German/Danish war for Schleswig-Holstein between 1848 and 1851.

Seeing how the Prussian coast was easily blockaded by the Danish navy, Bauer quickly developed a plan to build a new type of submersible ship to help break the blockade. He began studying hydraulics and ship construction. However, before his studies could get very far, the troops of the German Confederation decided to withdraw and surrendered Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. However, Bauer was determined to realize his plan and left the Bavarian Army to join the forces of Schleswig-Holstein.

It proved very hard for Bauer, who held only a low military rank, to get his plans through the military bureaucracy, not to mention obtaining funds to build his submarine. He finally succeeded with the help of Werner von Siemens and others, being granted a small sum to build a model of his proposed u-boat.

==The Brandtaucher (&quot;Incendiary Diver&quot;) Submarine==
Incendiary ships were a well known concept in blockade-breaking. A ship was loaded with explosives and set free to drift into the enemy fleet, exploding at contact. The &quot;incendiary diver&quot; was planned to work on a similar principle: It would dive under an enemy vessel, fix an electrically triggered mine to its hull and escape, igniting the mine from a safe distance. More or less the same technique was employed by all military submarine designs of that time, like Julius Kröhl’s &quot;Explorer&quot;, the &quot;U.S.S. Alligator&quot; by Brutus de Villeroi and the famous &quot;Hunley&quot;, which became the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel.

After the model of the submarine, built by Bauer himself, proved to be working, he was granted sufficient funds to build a full scale submarine. But the military authorities still were largely against Bauer’s plan and forced Bauer to change his designs in order to reduce costs.

The finished &quot;Brandtaucher&quot;, built by August Howaldt of the later Howaldtswerke was 28 feet long, weighing about 70,000 pounds. As at that time no suitable mechanical power system was available, the submarine was powered by two sailors turning a big tread wheel with their hands and feet. The third crew member, the captain, was positioned at the stern of the submarine. His job was to operate the rudders and other controls. Having arrived under the target ship, the captain would reach out through a gutta percha (rubber) glove fixed to an opening of the hull, grab the mine located within reach on the hull of the submarine and fix it on the target.

Had the &quot;Brandtaucher&quot; been built according to Bauer’s original designs, it would have achieved submersion by filling several tanks with sea water. But in the changed version the vessel itself was to be partly &quot;flooded&quot; with water, thus rendering the submarine dangerously unstable. Also the thickness of the hull and the dimensions of the pumps had to be greatly reduced.

First trials of the submarine took place in December 1850. Although Bauer wanted to make several improvements of the submarine, the military ordered a public show on 1 February 1851.

This public demonstration almost ended in a disaster. After reaching a depth of 30 ft the craft began to lay down by the stern. As the submarine sank down, the thin walls could not take the water pressure any more and started to crack. The water pressure proved too much for the weak pumps and the propeller wheel was damaged when the vessel began to keel over. The submarine slowly sank to the ground of the Kiel harbour.
For six hours Bauer and his sailors had to wait inside the sunken craft, until enough water had seeped in. This increased the air pressure inside the submarine and finally allowed the men to open the blocked hatchway. As the submarine stayed buried on the ground of the sea, its crew came to the surface unharmed. This was the first submarine escape to be witnessed and reported.

The sunken submarine was raised in 1887 and can now be visited at the museum of military history at Dresden, Germany (&quot;Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr&quot;).

==The Seeteufel (&quot;Sea Devil&quot;) Submarine==

After the sinking of the &quot;Brandtaucher&quot;, Bauer instantly began to make plans for an improved, larger submarine. But the government of Schleswig-Holstein refused to support Bauer after their bad experience with Bauer’s first submarine.

So Bauer left Schleswig-Holstein. In the following years he tried to obtain support for his invention in several countries, like the Austria-Hungary, the British Empire or France. Finally, in 1855, Bauer made a contract with the grand prince of St. Petersburg (Russia). During that year Bauer built his second submarine, the &quot;Seeteufel&quot; (&quot;Sea Devil&quot; or &quot;Angler&quot;) in St. Petersburg.

Much less information is known about this submarine than about the &quot;Brandtaucher&quot;. However, it is said to have been twice as long as its predecessor, its iron walls 1/2&#x27; thick with 21 windows in them. It had three big cylinders to hold water as diving ballast and was designed for a crew of 12.

Having learned from his first boat’s disaster, Bauer provided the &quot;Sea Devil&quot; with a newly invented rescue device: the &quot;diver’s chamber&quot;. Through this chamber, which worked like an airlock, divers could leave and enter the submerged vessel.

The &quot;Sea Devil&quot; proved to be a very good design. It made 133 successful diving runs within four months. But during the 134th dive, the submarine got stuck in the sand of the seafloor. By emptying the water cylinders with the pumps, the crew managed to raise the submarine high enough so that the hatchway was above the waterline. The whole crew (including Bauer) was saved, but unfortunately, the submarine sank back to the bottom of the sea.

==Legacy==

After the end of the &quot;Sea Devil&quot;, Bauer left Russia. Realizing he would not find support for another submarine, he undertook other projects. In 1863 Bauer managed to raise a sunken ship by using inflatable balloons made of canvas. But his more ambitious plans all failed because of a complete lack of funding. Disappointed, Bauer died in 1875 in Munich.

It would be wrong to claim the German submarine fleet of the World wars was directly descended from Wilhelm Bauer’s prototypes, but he nevertheless influenced them. The modern submarine began its history with the inventions of Simon Lake and John Philip Holland. However, the submarine pioneers of the 19th century - de Villeroi, Monturiol, Hunley and others - were all aware of Bauer’s efforts and drew inspiration and even ideas from his submarine.

In 1960 the German &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; renamed a Type XXI submarine &quot;Wilhelm Bauer&quot; after him.

==Films about Bauer==
In 1941, German director Herbert Selpin directed a biopic about Bauer with the title &quot;Geheimakte W.B.1&quot; (&quot;Secret file W.B.1&quot;; W.B = Wilhelm Bauer)), which was released in 1942. It was a propaganda movie to further the submarine war. The plot was based on the novel &quot;Der Eiserne Seehund&quot; (&quot;The iron seal&quot;) from Hans Arthur Thies, published in 1941.

Bauer&#x27;s life and work, as well as the design principles of his “Incendiary diver”, are described in the documentary film &quot;Submarine Ingenieur&quot; by Kiel-based filmmaker Zoran Simic. His film uses numerous 3D graphics sequences to illustrate the functioning of the submarine. On 3 February 2008 the 57-minute version of the film was shown in the local cinema, in the event centre KoKi, in Kiel.

<doc id="644078" wikidata="Q3144986" url="?curid=644078" title="Alcoholic hepatitis">
<text>Alcoholic hepatitis is hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) due to excessive intake of alcohol. Patients typically have a history of at least 10 years of heavy alcohol intake, typically 8–10 drinks per day. It is usually found in association with fatty liver, an early stage of alcoholic liver disease, and may contribute to the progression of fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis. Symptoms may present acutely after a large amount of alcoholic intake in a short time period, or after years of excess alcohol intake. Signs and symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), fatigue and hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure). Mild cases are self-limiting, but severe cases have a high risk of death. Severity in alcoholic hepatitis is determined several clinical prediction models such as the Maddrey&#x27;s Discriminant Function and the MELD score.

Severe cases may be treated with glucocorticoids with a response rate of about 60%. The condition often comes on suddenly and may progress in severity very rapidly.

==Signs and symptoms==

Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by a number of symptoms, which may include feeling unwell, enlargement of the liver, development of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), and modest elevation of liver enzyme levels (as determined by liver function tests). It may also present with Hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure) causing symptoms such as confusion, decreased levels of consciousness, or asterixis, (a characteristic flapping movement when the wrist is extended indicative of hepatic encephalopathy). Severe cases are characterized by profound jaundice, obtundation (ranging from drowsiness to unconsciousness), and progressive critical illness; the mortality rate is 50% within 30 days of onset despite best care.

Alcoholic hepatitis is distinct from cirrhosis caused by long-term alcohol consumption. Alcoholic hepatitis can occur in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis by itself does not lead to cirrhosis, but cirrhosis is more common in patients with long term alcohol consumption. Some alcoholics develop acute hepatitis as an inflammatory reaction to the cells affected by fatty change. This is not directly related to the dose of alcohol. Some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. This inflammatory reaction to the fatty change is called alcoholic steatohepatitis and the inflammation probably predisposes to liver fibrosis by activating hepatic stellate cells to produce collagen.
==Pathophysiology==
The pathological mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis are incompletely understood but a combination of direct hepatocyte damage by alcohol and its metabolites in addition to increased intestinal permeability are thought to play a role. Heavy alcohol consumption increases intestinal permeability by causing direct damage to enterocytes (intestinal absorptive cells) and causing disruptions of tight junctions that form a barrier between the enterocytes. This leads to increased intestinal permeability which then leads to pathogenic gut bacteria (such as enterococcus faecalis) or immunogenic fungi entering the portal circulation, and travelling to the liver where they cause hepatocyte damage. In the case of enterococcus faecalis, the bacterium can release an exotoxin which is directly damaging to liver cells. Chronic alcohol consumption may alter the gut microbiome and promote the production of these pathogenic bacteria. Many of these pathogenic bacteria also contain Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), extracellular motifs that are recognized by the immune system as foreign material, which may lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response in the liver which further leads to hepatocyte damage.

Alcohol is also directly damaging to liver cells. Alcohol is metabolized to acetaldehyde in the liver via the enzymes CYP2E1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde forms reactive oxygen species in the liver as well as acting as a DNA adduct (binding to DNA) leading to direct hepatocyte damage. This manifests as lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, and glutathione (an endogenous antioxidant) depletion. Damaged hepatocytes release Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which are molecules that lead to further activation of the immune system&#x27;s inflammatory response and further hepatocyte damage.

The chronic inflammation seen in alcoholic hepatitis leads to a distinctive fibrotic response, with fibrogenic cell type activation. This occurs via an increased extracellular matrix deposition around hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells which causes a peri-cellular fibrosis known as &quot;chickenwire fibrosis&quot;. This peri-cellular chickenwire fibrosis leads to portal hypertension or an elevated blood pressure in the portal veins that drain blood from the intestines to the liver. This causes many of the sequelae of chronic liver disease including esophageal varices (with associated variceal bleeding), ascites and splenomegaly.

The chronic inflammation seen in alcoholic hepatitis also leads to impaired hepatocyte differentiation, impairments in hepatocyte regeneration and hepatocyte de-differentiation into cholangiocyte type cells. This leads to defects in the liver&#x27;s many functions including impairments in bilirubin transport, clotting factor synthesis, glucose metabolism and immune dysfunction. This impaired compensatory liver regenerative response further leads to a ductular reaction; a type of abnormal liver cell architecture.

Due to the release of DAMPs and PAMPs, an acute systemic inflammatory state can develop after extensive alcohol intake that dominates the clinical landscape of acute severe alcoholic hepatitis. IL-6 has been shown to have the most robust increase among pro-inflammatory mediators in these patients. Furthermore, decreased levels of IL-13, an antagonistic cytokine of IL-6 was found to be closely associated with short-term (90-day) mortality in severe alcoholic hepatitis patients.

Some signs and pathological changes in liver histology include:
* Mallory&#x27;s hyaline body – a condition where pre-keratin filaments accumulate in hepatocytes. This sign is not limited to alcoholic liver disease, but is often characteristic.
* Ballooning degeneration – hepatocytes in the setting of alcoholic change often swell up with excess fat, water and protein; normally these proteins are exported into the bloodstream. Accompanied with ballooning, there is necrotic damage. The swelling is capable of blocking nearby biliary ducts, leading to diffuse cholestasis.
* Inflammation – neutrophilic invasion is triggered by the necrotic changes and presence of cellular debris within the lobules. Ordinarily the amount of debris is removed by Kupffer cells, although in the setting of inflammation they become overloaded, allowing other white cells to spill into the parenchyma. These cells are particularly attracted to hepatocytes with Mallory bodies.
If chronic liver disease is also present:
* Fibrosis
* Cirrhosis – a progressive and permanent type of fibrotic degeneration of liver tissue.


== Epidemiology ==

* Alcoholic hepatitis occurs in approximately 1/3 of chronic alcohol drinkers. 
* 10-20% of patients with alcoholic hepatitis progress to alcoholic liver cirrhosis every year.
* Patients with liver cirrhosis develop liver cancer at a rate of 1.5% per year.
* In total, 70% of those with alcoholic hepatitis will go on to develop alcoholic liver cirrhosis in their lifetimes.
*Infection risk is elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (12–26%). It increases even higher with use of corticosteroids (50%) when compared with the general population.
*Untreated alcoholic hepatitis mortality in one month of presentation may be as high as 40-50%.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is made in a patient with history of significant alcohol intake who develops worsening liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin (typically greater than 3.0) and aminotransferases, and onset of jaundice within the last 8 weeks. The ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase is usually 2 or more. In most cases, the liver enzymes do not exceed 500. A liver biopsy is not required for the diagnosis, however it can help confirm alcoholic hepatitis as the cause of the hepatitis if the diagnosis is unclear.

==Management==
Clinical practice guidelines have recommended corticosteroids.

People should be risk stratified using a MELD Score or Child-Pugh score. These scores are used to evaluate the severity of the liver disease based on several lab values. The greater the score, the more severe the disease.

*Abstinence: Stopping further alcohol consumption is the number one factor for recovery in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.
*Nutrition Supplementation: Protein and calorie deficiencies are seen frequently in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and it negatively affects their outcomes. Improved nutrition has been shown to improve liver function and reduce incidences encephalopathy and infections.
*Corticosteroids: These guidelines suggest that patients with a modified Maddrey&#x27;s discriminant function score &gt; 32 or hepatic encephalopathy should be considered for treatment with prednisolone 40 mg daily for four weeks followed by a taper. Models such as the Lille Model can be used to monitor for improvement or to consider alternative treatment.
*Pentoxifylline: Systematic reviews comparing the treatment of pentoxifylline with corticosteroids show there is no benefit to treatment with pentoxifylline Potential for combined therapy: A large prospective study of over 1000 patients investigated whether prednisolone and pentoxifylline produced benefits when used alone or in combination. Pentoxifylline did not improve survival alone or in combination. Prednisolone gave a small reduction in mortality at 28 days but this did not reach significance, and there were no improvements in outcomes at 90 days or 1 year.
*Intravenous &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine: When used in conjunction with corticosteroids, improves survival at 28 days by decreasing rates of infection and hepatorenal syndrome.
*Liver Transplantation: Early liver transplantation is ideal and helps to save lives. However, most transplant providers in the United States require a period of alcohol abstinence (typically six months) prior to transplant, but the ethics and science behind this are controversial.

==Prognosis==
Females are more susceptible to alcohol-associated liver injury and are therefore at higher risk of alcohol-associated hepatitis. Certain genetic variations in the PNPLA3-encoding gene, which codes for an enzyme involved in triglyceride metabolism in adipose tissue are thought to influence disease severity. Other factors in alcoholic hepatitis associated with a poor prognosis include concomitant hepatic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury.

<text>Antoine Galland (; 4 April 1646 – 17 February 1715) was a French orientalist and archaeologist, most famous as the first European translator of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, which he called &quot;Les mille et une nuits&quot;. His version of the tales appeared in twelve volumes between 1704 and 1717 and exerted a significant influence on subsequent European literature and attitudes to the Islamic world. Jorge Luis Borges has suggested that Romanticism began when his translation was first read.

==Life and work==
Galland was born at Rollot in Picardy (now in the department of Somme). After completing school at Noyon, he studied Greek and Latin in Paris, where he also acquired some Arabic. In 1670 he was attached to the French embassy at Istanbul because of his excellent knowledge of Greek and, in 1673, he travelled in Syria and the Levant, where he copied a great number of inscriptions,
sketched and—in some cases—removed historical monuments.

After a brief visit to France, where his collection of ancient coins attracted some attention, Galland returned to the Levant in 1677. In 1679 he undertook a third voyage, being commissioned by the French East India Company to collect for the cabinet of Colbert. On the expiration of this commission, he was instructed by the government to continue his research, and had the title of antiquary to the king (Louis XIV) conferred upon him. During his prolonged residences abroad, he acquired a thorough knowledge of the Arabic, Turkish, and Persian languages and literatures, which, on his final return to France, enabled him to render valuable assistance to Melchisédech Thévenot, the keeper of the royal library, and to Barthélemy d&#x27;Herbelot de Molainville.

When d&#x27;Herbelot died in 1695, Galland continued his &quot;Bibliothèque orientale&quot; (&quot;Oriental Library&quot;), a huge compendium of information about Islamic culture, and principally a translation of the great Arabic encyclopedia &quot;Kaşf az-Zunūn&quot; by the celebrated Ottoman scholar Kâtip Çelebi. It was finally published in 1697 and was a major contribution to European knowledge about the Middle East, influencing writers such as William Beckford (in his oriental tale &quot;Vathek&quot;).

After the deaths of Thévenot and d&#x27;Herbelot, Galland lived for some time at Caen under the roof of Nicolas Foucault, the intendant of Caen, himself no mean archaeologist. There he began, in 1704, the publication of &quot;Les mille et Une Nuits&quot;, which excited immense interest during the time of its appearance and is still the standard French translation. In 1709 he was appointed to the chair of Arabic in the Collège de France. He continued to discharge the duties of this post until his death in 1715.

Besides a number of archaeological works, especially in the department of numismatics, Galland published in 1694 a compilation from the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, entitled &quot;Paroles remarquables, bons mots et maximes des orientaux&quot;, and in 1699 a translation from an Arabic manuscript, &quot;De l&#x27;origine et du progrès du café&quot;. The former of these works appeared in an English translation in 1795. His &quot;Contes et fables indiennes de Bidpai et de Lokrnan&quot; was published posthumously in 1724. Among his numerous manuscripts are a translation of the Qur&#x27;an and a &quot;Histoire générale des empereurs Turcs&quot;. His journal was published by Charles Schefer in 1881.

===Translation of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot;===
Galland had come across a manuscript of &quot;The Tale of Sindbad the Sailor&quot; in Constantinople during the 1690s and, in 1701, he published his translation of it into French. Its success encouraged him to embark on a translation of a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Syrian manuscript (now known as the Galland Manuscript) of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot;. The first two volumes of this work, under the title &quot;Mille et Une Nuits&quot;, appeared in 1704. The twelfth and final volume was published posthumously in 1717.

He translated the first part of his work solely from the Syrian manuscript. In 1709 he was introduced to a Maronite Christian from Aleppo, Hanna Diab, who recounted fourteen more stories to Galland from memory. He chose to include seven of these tales in his version of the &quot;Nights&quot;.

Mystery surrounds the origins of some of the most famous tales. For instance, there are no Arabic manuscripts of &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Ali Baba&quot;, the so-called &quot;orphan tales&quot;, which pre-date Galland&#x27;s translation. Galland had in turn heard these tales from the Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab.

Galland also adapted his translation to the taste of the time. The immediate success the tales enjoyed was partly due to the vogue for fairy stories (French: &quot;contes de fées&quot;), which had been started in France in the 1690s by his friend Charles Perrault. Galland was also eager to conform to the literary canons of the era. He cut many of the erotic passages as well as all of the poetry. This caused Sir Richard Burton to refer to &quot;Galland&#x27;s delightful abbreviation and adaptation&quot; which &quot;in no wise represent(s) the eastern original.&quot;

His translation was greeted with immense enthusiasm and had soon been translated into many other European languages: English (a &quot;Grub Street&quot; version appeared in 1706), German (1712), Italian (1722), Dutch (1732), Russian (1763), and Polish (1768). They produced a wave of imitations and the widespread 18th century fashion for oriental tales. As Jorge Luis Borges wrote:Another fact is undeniable. The most famous and eloquent encomiums of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot; – by Coleridge, Thomas de Quincey, Stendhal, Tennyson, Edgar Allan Poe, Newman – are from readers of Galland&#x27;s translation. Two hundred years and ten better translations have passed, but the man in Europe or the Americas who thinks of the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; thinks, invariably, of this first translation. The Spanish adjective &quot;milyunanochesco&quot; [thousand-and-one-nights-esque] ... has nothing to do with the erudite obscenities of Burton or Mardrus and everything to do with Antoine Galland&#x27;s bijoux and sorceries.

<text>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (), or ACE, is a central component of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which controls blood pressure by regulating the volume of fluids in the body. It converts the hormone angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Therefore, ACE indirectly increases blood pressure by causing blood vessels to constrict. ACE inhibitors are widely used as pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Other lesser known functions of ACE are degradation of bradykinin, substance P and amyloid beta-protein.

== Nomenclature ==
ACE is also known by the following names:
* dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I
* peptidase P
* dipeptide hydrolase
* peptidyl dipeptidase
* angiotensin converting enzyme
* kininase II
* angiotensin I-converting enzyme
* carboxycathepsin
* dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase
* &quot;hypertensin converting enzyme&quot; peptidyl dipeptidase I
* peptidyl-dipeptide hydrolase
* peptidyldipeptide hydrolase
* endothelial cell peptidyl dipeptidase
* peptidyl dipeptidase-4
* PDH
* peptidyl dipeptide hydrolase
* DCP
* CD143

== Function ==
ACE hydrolyzes peptides by the removal of a dipeptide from the C-terminus. Likewise it converts the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to the octapeptide angiotensin II by removing the dipeptide His-Leu.
ACE is a central component of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which controls blood pressure by regulating the volume of fluids in the body.
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor in a substrate concentration-dependent manner. Angiotensin II binds to the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1), which sets off a number of actions that result in vasoconstriction and therefore increased blood pressure.
ACE is also part of the kinin–kallikrein system where it degrades bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, and other vasoactive peptides.

Kininase II is the same as angiotensin-converting enzyme. Thus, the same enzyme (ACE) that generates a vasoconstrictor (ANG II) also disposes of vasodilators (bradykinin).

== Mechanism ==
ACE is a zinc metalloproteinase. The zinc center catalyses the peptide hydrolysis. Reflecting the critical role of zinc, ACE can be inhibited by metal-chelating agents.

The E384 residue is mechanistically critical. As a general base, it deprotonates the zinc-bound water, producing a nucleophilic Zn-OH center. The resulting ammonium group then serves as a general acid to cleave the C-N bond.

The function of the chloride ion is very complex and is highly debated. The anion activation by chloride is a characteristic feature of ACE. It was experimentally determined that the activation of hydrolysis by chloride is highly dependent on the substrate. While it increases hydrolysis rates for e.g. Hip-His-Leu it inhibits hydrolysis of other substrates like Hip-Ala-Pro. Under physiological conditions the enzyme reaches about 60% of its maximal activity toward angiotensin I while it reaches its full activity toward bradykinin. It is therefore assumed that the function of the anion activation in ACE provides high substrate specificity. Other theories say that the chloride might simply stabilize the overall structure of the enzyme.

== Genetics ==
The ACE gene, &quot;ACE&quot;, encodes two isozymes. The somatic isozyme is expressed in many tissues, mainly in the lung, including vascular endothelial cells, epithelial kidney cells, and testicular Leydig cells, whereas the germinal is expressed only in sperm. Brain tissue has ACE enzyme, which takes part in local RAS and converts Aβ42 (which aggregates into plaques) to Aβ40 (which is thought to be less toxic) forms of beta amyloid. The latter is predominantly a function of N domain portion on the ACE enzyme. ACE inhibitors that cross the blood–brain barrier and have preferentially selected N-terminal activity may therefore cause accumulation of Aβ42 and progression of dementia.

== Disease relevance ==
ACE inhibitors are widely used as pharmaceutical drugs in the treatment of conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

ACE inhibitors inhibit ACE competitively. That results in the decreased formation of angiotensin II and decreased metabolism of bradykinin, which leads to systematic dilation of the arteries and veins and a decrease in arterial blood pressure. In addition, inhibiting angiotensin II formation diminishes angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, leading to a decrease in water and sodium reabsorption and a reduction in extracellular volume.

ACE&#x27;s effect on Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is still highly debated. Alzheimer patients usually show higher ACE levels in their brain. Some studies suggest that ACE inhibitors that are able to pass the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) could enhance the activity of major amyloid-beta peptide degrading enzymes like neprilysin in the brain resulting in a slower development of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. More recent research suggests that ACE inhibitors can reduce risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the absence of apolipoprotein E4 alleles (ApoE4), but will have no effect in ApoE4- carriers. Another more recent hypothesis is that higher levels of ACE can prevent Alzheimer&#x27;s. It is assumed that ACE can degrade beta-amyloid in brain blood vessels and therefore help prevent the progression of the disease.

A negative correlation between the ACE1 D-allele frequency and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 has been established.

== Pathology ==
* &quot;Elevated&quot; levels of ACE are also found in sarcoidosis, and are used in diagnosing and monitoring this disease. Elevated levels of ACE are also found in leprosy, hyperthyroidism, acute hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, osteoarthritis, amyloidosis, Gaucher disease, pneumoconiosis, histoplasmosis and miliary tuberculosis. It is also noted in some patients with extensive plaque psoriasis.
* Serum levels are &quot;decreased&quot; in renal disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypothyroidism.

== Influence on athletic performance ==

The angiotensin converting enzyme gene has more than 160 polymorphisms described as of 2018.

Studies have shown that different genotypes of angiotensin converting enzyme can lead to varying influence on athletic performance. However, these data should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small size of the investigated groups.

The rs1799752 I/D polymorphism (aka rs4340, rs13447447, rs4646994) consists of either an insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287 base pair sequence in intron 16 of the gene. The DD genotype is associated with higher plasma levels of the ACE protein, the DI genotype with intermediate levels, and II with lower levels. During physical exercise, due to higher levels of the ACE for D-allele carriers, hence higher capacity to produce angiotensin II, the blood pressure will increase sooner than for I-allele carriers. This results in a lower maximal heart rate and lower maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). Therefore, D-allele carriers have a 10% increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the D-allele is associated with a greater increase in left ventricular growth in response to training compared to the I-allele. On the other hand, I-allele carriers usually show an increased maximal heart rate due to lower ACE levels, higher maximum oxygen uptake and therefore show an enhanced endurance performance. The I allele is found with increased frequency in elite distance runners, rowers and cyclists. Short distance swimmers show an increased frequency of the D-allele, since their discipline relies more on strength than endurance.

==History==
The enzyme was reported by Leonard T. Skeggs Jr. in 1956. The crystal structure of human testis ACE was solved in the year 2002 by Ramanathan Natesh in the lab of K. Ravi Acharya in collaboration with Sylva Schwager and Edward Sturrock who purified the protein. It is located mainly in the capillaries of the lungs but can also be found in endothelial and kidney epithelial cells.

<text>François Lenormant (; 17 January 1837 – 9 December 1883) was a 19th-century French Hellenist, Assyriologist, and archaeologist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lenormant&#x27;s father, Charles Lenormant, distinguished as an archaeologist, numismatist and Egyptologist, was anxious that his son should follow in his steps. He made him begin Greek at the age of six, and the child responded so well to this precocious scheme of instruction, that when he was only fourteen an essay of his, on the Greek tablets found at Memphis, appeared in the &quot;Revue Archéologique&quot;. In 1856 he won the numismatic prize of the Académie des Inscriptions with an essay entitled &quot;Classification des monnaies des Lagides&quot; and in 1862 he became sub-librarian of the Institut de France.

In 1858 he visited Italy and in 1859 accompanied his father on a journey of exploration to Greece, during which Charles succumbed to fever at Athens. Lenormant returned to Greece three times during the next six years, supervising excavations at Eleusis and gave up all the time he could spare from his official work to archaeological research. He summarized his studies in a popular &quot;Manuel d&#x27;histoire ancienne de l&#x27;Orient jusqu&#x27;aux guerres Médiques&quot; (Paris 1868). These peaceful labors were rudely interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War, when Lenormant served with the army and was wounded in the Siege of Paris. In 1874 he was appointed professor of archaeology at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, and in the following year he collaborated with the Baron Jean de Witte in founding the Gazette archéologique.

===Accomplishments===
As early as 1867 he had turned his attention to Assyrian studies; he was among the first to recognize in the cuneiform inscriptions the existence of a non-Semitic language he named Akkadian (today it is known as Sumerian). Lenormant&#x27;s knowledge was of encyclopaedic extent, ranging over an immense number of subjects, and at the same time thorough, though somewhat lacking perhaps in the strict accuracy of the modern school. Most of his varied studies were directed towards tracing the origins of the two great civilizations of the ancient world, which were to be sought in Mesopotamia and on the shores of the Mediterranean. He had a perfect passion for exploration. Besides his early expeditions to Greece, he visited the south of Italy three times with this object, and it was while exploring in Calabria that he met with an accident which ended fatally in Paris after a long illness.

The amount and variety of Lenormant&#x27;s work is truly amazing when it is remembered that he died at the early age of forty-six. By 1881 he&#x27;d been named as a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Probably the best known of his books are &quot;Les Origines de l&#x27;histoire d&#x27;après la Bible&quot;, and his ancient history of the East and account of Chaldean magic. He also contributed articles to the &quot;Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines&quot;, though he did not live to see the dictionary&#x27;s completion. For breadth of view, combined with extraordinary subtlety of intuition, he was probably unrivalled.
He is immortalized in Greece with a main road in Athens named after him.

<doc id="644111" wikidata="Q982324" url="?curid=644111" title="Hugh Shearer">
<text>Hugh Lawson Shearer (18 May 1923 – 15 July 2004) was a Jamaican trade unionist and politician, who served as the 3rd Prime Minister of Jamaica, from 1967 to 1972. He was also Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade from 1980 to 1989, under Edward Seaga.

== Early life and education ==
Shearer was born in Martha Brae, Trelawney, Jamaica, which is located just south of the parish capital of Falmouth. His father was James Shearer, a former soldier, and his mother was Esther Lindo, a dressmaker.

Shearer attended St Simon&#x27;s College after winning a parish scholarship to the school and later received an honorary LLD from Howard University School of Law.

== Trade union career ==
In 1941, he took a job on the staff of a weekly trade union newspaper, the &quot;Jamaican Worker&quot;. His first political promotion came in 1943, when Sir Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party (JLP), took over editorship of the paper and took Shearer under his wing. Shearer continued to get promotion after promotion within the union and acquired a Government Trade Union scholarship in 1947.

He was appointed Island Supervisor of Bustamante&#x27;s trade union, BITU, and shortly afterwards elected vice-president of the union.

== Political career ==
Shearer was elected to the House of Representatives of Jamaica as member for Western Kingston in 1955, an office he retained for the next four years until he was defeated in the 1959 elections.

Shearer was a member of the Senate from 1962 to 1967, at the same time filling the role of Jamaica&#x27;s chief spokesman on foreign affairs as Deputy Chief of Mission at the United Nations. In 1967 he was elected as member for Southern Clarendon and, after the death of Sir Donald Sangster, appointed Prime Minister on 11 April 1967.
Thanks to his work with the &quot;Jamaican Worker&quot; earlier in his life, Shearer managed to stay on generally good terms with the Jamaican working class, and was generally well liked by the populace. However, he did cause an outcry of anger in October 1968 when his government banned the historian, Walter Rodney from re-entering the country. On 16 October a series of riots, known as the Rodney Riots broke out, after peaceful protest by students from the University of the West Indies campus at Mona, was suppressed by police; rioting spreading throughout Kingston. Shearer stood by the ban claiming that Rodney was a danger to Jamaica, citing his socialist ties, trips to Cuba and the USSR, as well as his radical Black nationalism.

Shearer was generally uncomfortable with notions of pan-Africanism or militant black nationalism. He was also insecure about the stability of newly independent Jamaica in the late 1960s.

His term as prime minister was a prosperous one for Jamaica, with three new alumina refineries were built, along with three large tourist resorts. These six buildings formed the basis of Jamaica&#x27;s mining and tourism industries, the two biggest earners for the country.

Shearer&#x27;s term was also marked by a great upswing in secondary school enrolment after an intense education campaign on his part. Fifty new schools were constructed.

It was by pressure from Shearer that the Law of the Sea Authority chose Kingston to house its headquarters.

In the 1972 Jamaican general election, the JLP was defeated by 37 seats to 16 seats, and the People&#x27;s National Party leader, Michael Manley, became prime minister.

In 1974, Shearer was replaced as leader of the JLP by Edward Seaga. Between 1980 and 1989, during the prime ministership of Seaga, Shearer was deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs.

== Personal life ==
Hugh Shearer, while working as a journalist, married his first wife Lunette, an accounting clerk, on 7 October 1947. They purchased a property at Chisholm Avenue where they lived, until Mr. Shearer left the matrimonial home.

Shearer was separated from his first wife, with whom he had three children, by the time he became prime minister in 1967.

Hugh Shearer married his second wife, Dr. Denise Eldemire, on 28 August 1998. She is the daughter of the late Dr. Herbert Eldemire, who served as Jamaica&#x27;s first Health Minister from 1962 to 1972. The couple were married for nearly 6 years, until his death in July 2004

== Death and legacy ==
He died at his home in Kingston on 15 July 2004, at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife, sons Corey Alexander, Howard, Lance and Donald, and daughters Hope, Hilary, Heather, Mischka Garel, and Ana Margaret Sanchez.

On 14 May 2009, the Bank of Jamaica announced a plan to issue a JA$5000 note with the likeness of Shearer on it, as was explained in detail on Monday 18 May 2009 by the Governor of Jamaica&#x27;s Central Bank Derick Milton Latibeaudiere.

The $5000 bill with Hugh Shearer&#x27;s portrait was put in circulation on 24 September 2009. In Jamaican slang, a $5000 banknote is referred to as a &quot;Shearer&quot;. Since 2023, Donald Sangster has been featured on the $5000 bill alongside Shearer.

<text>Dominique Vivant, Baron Denon (; 4 January 1747 – 27 April 1825) was a French artist, writer, diplomat, author, and archaeologist. Denon was a diplomat for France under Louis XV and Louis XVI. He was appointed as the first Director of the Louvre museum by Napoleon after the Egyptian campaign of 1798–1801, and is commemorated in the Denon Wing of the modern museum and in the Dominique-Vivant Denon Research Center. His two-volume &quot;Voyage dans la basse et la haute Egypte&quot; (&quot;Journey in Lower and Upper Egypt&quot;), 1802, was foundational for modern Egyptology.

==Birth and name==
Vivant Denon was born in Givry, near Chalon-sur-Saône to a family called &quot;de Non&quot;, of the &quot;petite noblesse&quot; or gentry, and until the French Revolution signed himself as &quot;le chevalier de Non&quot;. Like many of the nobility, he revised his surname at the Revolution to lose the &quot;nobiliary particle&quot; &quot;de&quot;. He seems to have consistently avoided using his baptised first name &quot;Dominique&quot;, preferring his middle name &quot;Vivant&quot;, and so is usually known as &quot;Vivant Denon&quot;. He was created &quot;Baron Denon&quot; by Napoleon in August 1812, at the age of 65.

==Early life==
He was sent to Paris to study law, but he showed a decided preference for art and literature, and soon gave up his profession. In his twenty-third year he produced a comedy, &quot;Le Bon Pére&quot;, which obtained a &quot;succès d&#x27;estime&quot;, as he had already won a position in society by his agreeable manners and exceptional conversational powers. He became a favorite of Louis XV, who entrusted him with the collection and arrangement of a cabinet of medals and antique gems for Madame de Pompadour, and subsequently appointed him &quot;attaché&quot; to the French embassy at St. Petersburg.

==Diplomatic career==
On the accession of Louis XVI, Denon was transferred to Sweden; but he returned, after a brief interval, to Paris with the ambassador M. de Vergennes, who had been appointed foreign minister. In 1775 Denon was sent on a secret mission to Switzerland, and took the opportunity of visiting Voltaire at Ferney. He made a portrait of the philosopher, which was engraved and published on his return to Paris. His next diplomatic appointment was to Naples, where he spent seven years, first as secretary to the embassy and afterwards as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;. He devoted this period to a careful study of the monuments of ancient art, collecting many specimens and making drawings of others. He also perfected himself in etching and &quot;mezzotinto&quot; engraving. While in Naples he met Sir William and Lady Hamilton and he etched Lady Hamilton &#x27;posing&#x27;.

The death of his patron, Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, in 1787, led to his recall, and the rest of his life was given mainly to artistic pursuits. On his return to Paris he was admitted a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (1787). After a brief interval he returned to Italy, living chiefly at Venice. He also visited Florence and Bologna, and afterwards went to Switzerland. While there he heard that his property had been confiscated, and his name placed on the list of the proscribed, and with characteristic courage he resolved at once to return to Paris: his situation was critical, but he was spared, thanks to the friendship of the painter Jacques-Louis David, who obtained for him a commission to furnish designs for republican costumes. When the Revolution was over, Denon was one of the bands of eminent men who frequented the house of Joséphine de Beauharnais. Here he met Napoleon, to whose fortunes he wisely attached himself.

==Egypt and the Louvre==
At Bonaparte&#x27;s invitation he joined the expedition to Egypt as part of the arts and literature section of the Institut d&#x27;Égypte, and thus found the opportunity of gathering the materials for his most important literary and artistic work. He accompanied General Desaix to Upper Egypt, and made numerous sketches of the monuments of ancient art, sometimes under the very fire of the enemy. The results were published in his &quot;Voyage dans la basse et la haute Egypte&quot; (&quot;Journey in Lower and Upper Egypt&quot;), published as two volumes in 1802. The work crowned his reputation both as an archaeologist and as an artist, and sparked Egyptian Revival architecture and decorative arts.

On 19 November 1802, he was appointed by Napoleon to the important office of director-general of museums and head of the new Musée Napoléon, which he filled until the Allied occupation of Paris in 1814, when he had to retire. He was a devoted servant of Napoleon, on whose behalf he personally looted vast numbers of works of art in Italy, the Low Countries and Germany and, through agents (including Francisco Goya), in Spain, for the Musée Napoleon in Paris. Many of these remain in the Louvre, and elsewhere in France, today. In particular, Denon was one of the first men to appreciate the importance of the Italian &#x27;primitives&#x27;. The majority of those now in the Louvre were looted by Denon during a sweep he made through Italy in 1812. They were publicly paraded, with elephants and other wild animals, like a Roman triumph, through the streets of Paris, before being deposited in the Louvre.

Denon took full opportunity, while working for Napoleon, to assemble for himself an enormous collection of paintings, drawings, prints, books, statuary and &quot;objets d&#x27;art.&quot; This collection was sold at auction over several days after Denon&#x27;s death. In 1810 he also assisted the Hermitage Museum in its acquisition of Rosso Fiorentino&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child with Cherubs&quot; in Paris.

==Retirement and death==
At the Bourbon Restoration of 1814 Denon was confirmed in place for a year, but was too closely associated with the former regime to keep the position for long, and was replaced by Auguste de Forbin in 1816. After his forced retirement he began an illustrated history of ancient and modern art, in which he had the cooperation of several skillful engravers. He died at Paris in 1825, leaving the work unfinished. It was published posthumously, with an explanatory text by Amaury Duval, under the title &quot;Monuments des arts du dessin chez les peuples tant anciens que modernes, recueillis par Vivant Denon&quot; in 1829. Denon was also the author of an erotic novel, &quot;Point de lendemain&quot;, published in 1777 (in 1812 as a separate work), and of a number of erotic etchings.

He died in Paris and is buried in the world famous Père Lachaise Cemetery, where his grave is marked by a life-sized statue.

==Legacy==

In Napoleon III&#x27;s Louvre expansion in the 1850s, Denon&#x27;s name was given to the central pavilion of the Nouveau Louvre&#x27;s South Wing. In the Grand Louvre project of the late 1980s, the entire South Wing of the Louvre Palace was named after him (&quot;aile Denon&quot;, echoing Richelieu to the North and Sully to the East) as part of a signposting concept developed by the Carbone Smolan Agency. 

==Works==
* 
* A note at the beginning of this book states &#x27;Point De Lendemain, the authorship of which has also been attributed to Vivant Denon was first published in 1777&#x27;. Hence the authorship being stated as Dorat in Sutton&#x27;s translation.

==In fiction==
Anthony O&#x27;Neill included the character of Vivant Denon in his novel &quot;The Empire of Eternity&quot;, in which he is portrayed as bisexual.

Lee Langley has written a biographical novel of Denon&#x27;s life, &quot;A conversation on the Quai Voltaire&quot;.

Ruth McKenney also includes the character of Vivant Denon in her novel &quot;Mirage&quot;.

Milan Kundera&#x27;s &quot;Slowness&quot; (1995) includes a rewriting of Vivant-Denon&#x27;s &quot;Point de lendemain&quot;.

<doc id="644122" wikidata="Q6570211" url="?curid=644122" title="List of English words of Turkic origin">
<text>This is a list of words that have entered into the English language from the Turkic languages. Many of them came via traders and soldiers from and in the Ottoman Empire. There are some Turkic words as well, most of them entered English via the Russian language.
==Introduction==

Languages of Turkic peoples left numerous traces in different languages, including the English language. Turkic borrowings, which belong to the social and political vocabulary, are generally used in special literature and in the historical and ethnographical works, which relate to the life of Turkic and Muslim peoples. The ethnographical words are generally used in the scientific literature, and in the historical and ethnographical texts.

The adoption of Indian (principally Hindustani) words, among which there were some Turkic borrowings, became one of the ways for the words of the Turkic origin to penetrate English. Additionally, several words of Turkic origin penetrated English through Central or Eastern European languages like Russian and Polish. Albanian, German, Latin, Spanish, Italian, French, Hungarian and Serbo-Croatian were also intermediary languages for the Turkic words to penetrate English, as well as containing numerous Turkic loanwords themselves (e.g. Serbo-Croatian contains around 5,000 Turkic loanwords, primarily from Turkish).

In the nineteenth century, Turkic loanwords, generally of Turkish origin, began to penetrate not only through the writings of the travelers, diplomats and merchants, and through the ethnographical and historical works, but also through the press. In 1847, there were two English-language newspapers in Istanbul – &quot;The Levant Herald&quot; and &quot;The Levant Times&quot;, seven newspapers in French, one in German and 37 in Turkish. Turkish contributed the largest share of the Turkic loans, which penetrated into the English directly. This can be explained by the fact that Turkey had the most intensive and wide connections with England. Nevertheless, there are many Turkic loans in English, which were borrowed by its contacts with other peoples – Azerbaijanis, Tatars, Uzbeks, Kazakhs and Kirghiz.
Most of the Turkic loans in English carry exotic or ethnographical connotations. They do not have equivalents in English, do not have synonymic relations with primordial words, and generally are used to describe the fauna, flora, life customs, political and social life, and an administrative-territorial structure of Turkic regions. But there are many Turkic loans, which are still part of the frequently used vocabulary. Some Turkic loans have acquired new meanings, unrelated to their etymology.

To conclude, the words of the Turkic origin began penetrating English as early as the Middle Ages, the Turkic loanwords found their way into English through other languages, most frequently through French. Since the 16c, beginning from the time of the establishment of the direct contacts between England and Turkey, and Russia, in English appeared new direct borrowings from Turkic languages. German, Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, French, Arabic, Armenian, Afrikaans, Hungarian, Yiddish, Hindustani, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Malayan, to a different extent, took part in the process of the transfer of the Turkic words into English. The main language from which the borrowings were made, was Turkish.

<text>The Online Pupillage Application System, or OLPAS was a centralised service through which students applied for pupillage, the last stage of their training to barrister in England and Wales. It was a replacement for &#x27;PACH&#x27; the Pupillage Application Clearing House, and it was replaced in 2009 by a new, similar, system called Pupillage Portal. Previously, applications could be submitted for either the summer or autumn &#x27;season&#x27;, with deadlines in April and September in the year before pupillage was due to commence. Individual chambers were able to choose in which season they wished to recruit. The Pupillage Portal has done away with this, and operates just one round of applications annually.

The system is free of charge and consists of an online application form in which applicants may include their educational details, as well as work experience and career motivation. The service allows applicants to apply to a maximum of twelve chambers each season. Chambers that choose not to make use of the Portal have their own application procedures and forms, and may set different deadlines for each year&#x27;s applications.

<text>A Viking ring fortress, Trelleborg-type fortress, or trelleborg (pl. &quot;trelleborgs&quot;), is a type of circular fort of a special design, built in Scandinavia during the Viking Age. These fortresses have a strictly circular shape, with roads and gates pointing in the four cardinal directions. Inside the fort, each quadrant has one, in a single case four, square blocks of longhouses, completing the geometric symmetry. There are a total of five confirmed Viking ring fortresses at present, located in Denmark (although sites in Sweden and across Northern Europe have similar construction). They have been dated to the reign of Harold Bluetooth of Denmark, with an estimated near contemporary time of construction c. 980. Their exact historical context is subject to debate. In 2023, the five Danish forts were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List because of their unique architecture and testimony to the military power of the Jelling Dynasty.

== Etymology ==

This specific type of fortification was named after the first discovered example: Trelleborg near Slagelse, excavated in the years 1936-1941. Historically, the name &quot;trelleborg&quot; has been translated and explained as ″a fortress built by slaves″, since the Old Norse word for slave was &quot;thrall&quot; (The modern word is &quot;træl&quot; in Danish and in Swedish) and &quot;borg&quot; means fortress or city. The word &quot;trel&quot; (pl. &quot;trelle&quot;) is also a plausible explanation as it relates to the wooden staves which covered both sides of the protective circular walls.

== History ==
At the end of the 10th century Harold Bluetooth vied with tribal Saxons, the Holy Roman Empire—at that time governed by the (integrated) Saxon Ottonian house—and the Slavic Abodrit and Veleti tribes for the control of the southern region of the Jutland peninsula, This area was also the very same region presumed to have been the ancient homelands of the Angles. Harald also had to contend with Norse people exercising coastal raids. At the Firth of Schlei lay Hedeby, known in the contemporary literary sources as Schleswig, where the Danevirke complex of fortifications stretched across the foot of the peninsula, holding back the hostile hosts from entering the territory, as well as providing a safe trade route via Ejderen from the North Sea coastline into Hedeby and the Baltic Sea.

The entire complex of fortifications, bridges and roads, including Ravninge Bridge on the land route towards Jelling, are presumed to have been in the hands of Harold. The fortresses establish a string of strategic points stretching from Aggersborg at the north of Jutland southward across Funen to end in Borgring at the east coast of Zealand. They have been dated to the reign of Harold Bluetooth, who held sway until c. 985, where he was ousted by his son Sweyn Forkbeard, who eventually conquered the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Æthelred the Unready some years later. This is the apex of the Jelling dynasty, its patristic line ending the year 1042 with Harthacnut, son of Cnut the Great, son of Sweyn.

Fortifications of a similar shape and date have been found around other old towns in Scandinavia, including Borgeby, Trelleborgen, and Helsingborg in Skåne, Sweden, near Aarhus in Jutland, and Rygge, Norway Other, similar forts across Northern Europe include the Walcheren forts in Friesland (built in the outskirts of the Carolingian Empire, with a similar street orientation), and Warham Camp in England, but these are not considered Viking ring forts as they were likely built at different periods in time.

The precise purpose of the fortresses is unknown. Some historians argue that they functioned as military barracks or training grounds by Sweyn Forkbeard. However, it is more likely that they were intended as defensive strongholds along strategic trade points and/or administrative outposts of the budding state. Søren Sindbæk has offered the hypothesis that the fortresses allowed local populations to seek shelter within the fortress walls against an enemy while waiting for assistance from friendly forces from afar; this means that the fortresses helped Harold Bluetooth to control vast territory and send his army to a particular part of his territory without worrying that the undefended parts would be conquered or plundered. Others have debated whether the fortresses were defensive structures, military strongholds, or primarily served as barracks, as well as the economic, religious, and symbolic significance of the fortresses.

The fortresses were soon abandoned and never mentioned in the literary sources, effectively creating the enigma now known as &quot;trelleborge&quot; (Danish plural of &#x27;trelleborg&#x27;). Nonnebakken was enveloped by the near contemporary municipal bishopric of Odense, while the rest receded into the landscape. The modern discovery of these sites began in the 1930s, with the excavation of Trelleborg in Denmark. Since then, a total of five sites have been officially accepted as Viking ring fortresses.

During the royally funded research project &quot;Kongens Borge&quot; (The Kings Castles), in 2010, Denmark applied for the admission of Trelleborg, Fyrkat and Aggersborg as &quot;The Trelleborg Fortresses&quot; as a UNESCO World Heritage cultural property, It is rumoured, that Denmark and Sweden, perhaps around that time, applied for admission of the Viking ring fortresses, but the records available at the World Heritage Centre cannot confirm that any Swedish ring fortresses were ever mentioned. The five &quot;trelleborge&quot; presently known became the &quot;Viking-Age Ring Fortresses World Heritage Site&quot; in 2023.

== List of Viking ring fortresses ==

* Aggersborg near Aggersund, Denmark.
* Borgring near Køge, Denmark.
* Fyrkat near Hobro, Denmark.
* Nonnebakken in Odense, Denmark.
* Trelleborg near Slagelse, Denmark.
; Suspected
* Borgeby north of Lund, Skåne, Sweden.
* Helsingborg, Skåne, Sweden.
* Trelleborgen, Skåne, Sweden.

== Fortification typology ==
The &quot;trelleborgs&quot; had similar design, &quot;perfectly circular with gates opening to the four corners of the earth, and a courtyard divided into four areas which held large houses set in a square pattern.&quot; They differ clearly from other fortifications in that region because of their geometrical plan, though they do have some similarities with the Frankish forts at Walcheren. A short exposé over early Viking camps in Scandinavia, by Arjen Heijnis, has turned the picture around, marking out these earlier camps &quot;fundamentally different from later defensive structures (ie. the early castles).&quot;
The fortresses are sometimes partially encircled by advanced ramparts, though not always circular. It has been said the trelleborgs were measured with the Roman foot and that the pointed bottom of the moats is a Roman trait.

Dating by dendrochronology has found the wood used for the construction of Trelleborg to have been felled in the autumn of 980 and thus being used for building presumably in the spring of 981. The findings indicate a short construction time with no signs of maintenance, leading to the interpretation of only a short use of the buildings, maybe five years but hardly more than twenty. Fyrkat may be a little older, Aggersborg somewhat younger. 2014 brought a corresponding date to Borgring (end of 10th century), and, in 2019, following the geo-radar survey and subsequent excavation, Nonnebakken also was dated to c. 980. In the 2021 application to UNESCO, all five Danish &quot;trelleborgs&quot; appear with dates between 970 and 980. Some say the material found at Nonnebakken, Borgring, and the Scandian forts is not suffient for a precise dating. However, the layout of the trelleborgs in their local settings are so similar that it is probable that they were also functionally associated.

At the turn of the century much debate had surrounded the ring fortresses, particularly with emphasis on whether or not to add Nonnebakken to the list of recognized trelleborgs. Nonnebakken was accepted as late as 2017, though at that time the archaeologist Mads Runge concluded there were no signs of buildings inside the rampart. When geo-radar technology was applied the following year, evidence of structures inside the fort was found, affirming the site&#x27;s classification as a Viking ring fortress.

<text>Russian cuisine is a collection of the different dishes and cooking traditions of the Russian people as well as a list of culinary products popular in Russia, with most names being known since pre-Soviet times, coming from all kinds of social circles.

== History ==
The history of Russian cuisine was divided in four groups: Old Russian cuisine (9th to 16th century), Old Moscow cuisine (17th century), the cuisine that existed during the ruling of Peter and Catherine the Great (18th century), and finally Petersburg cuisine, which took place from the end of the 18th century to the 1860s. 

In the Old Russian period, the main food groups were bread, grains, and other foods that contained starch. Women baked pies with many different fillings, such as mushrooms or berries. During gatherings, a loaf of bread and salt was always present. Kasha, such as buckwheat and oats, were represented as wellbeing to the household. Many Russians used honey and berries and made them into gingerbread, which is still a popular Russian dessert. Many current Russian dishes were inspired from Asian cultures, such as pelmeni. 

In the 17th century, cuisine was separated based on economic class. The rich had meat and delicacies, such as caviar, while the poor had the most simple dishes. During this century, more food appeared, because new countries were annexed. During the Peter and Catherine the Great era, minced meat was incorporated into dishes and other European countries&#x27; cuisine was also mixed into Russian foods. In the last era (Petersburg cuisine), many French, German, Dutch, and Italian meals were incorporated into Russian foods, such as lamb and pork. The French popularized potatoes and tomatoes in dishes. Due to the long-lasting cold weather in Russia, many dishes were made to be preserved, so they would not have to take extra trips in the freezing snowy days.

Its foundations were laid by the peasant food of the rural population in an often harsh climate, with a combination of plentiful fish, pork, poultry, caviar, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, barley and millet provided the ingredients for a plethora of breads, pancakes, pies, cereals, beer and vodka. Soups and stews are centered on seasonal or storable produce, fish and meats. Such food remained the staple for the vast majority of Russians well into the 20th century.

The 16th through 18th centuries brought more refined culinary techniques. It was during this time period that smoked meats and fish, pastry cooking, salads, and green vegetables, chocolate, ice cream, wines, and juice were imported from abroad. At least for the urban aristocracy and provincial gentry, this opened the doors for the creative integration of these new foodstuffs with traditional Russian dishes.

In the early 20th century, the Revolution saw a rapid decline of elite cuisine, driven both by the new egalitarian state ideology and by disappearance of the old Imperial elites who used to be its consumers. The distinct Soviet cuisine was born, emphasizing fusion of the Union&#x27;s national cuisines, scientific approach to a diet, and industrial approach to food preparation and serving.

The fall of the Soviet Union saw the end of state monopoly on food service, and a corresponding diversification of cuisine. As average prosperity grew starting with the second decade after the collapse, so did the demand for fresh culinary experiences, prompting a renaissance of Imperial-era elite cuisine, as well as a wide search for novelty, local specialties, and creative reinterpretations, leading to the birth of what has been dubbed the New Russian cuisine.

== Ethnic and regional variations and influences==
The national Russian cuisine has evolved in a multicultural and multiethnic state, with strong mutual influence from the cuisines of other ethnic groups that live within the nation&#x27;s borders or had been a part of the Russian state historically.

Despite such deep mutual influence, many national cuisines within the borders of the Russian Federation maintain their uniqueness, such as Tatar cuisine, Sakha cuisine, or Yamal cuisine.

The Russian cuisine itself is also geographically diverse, its variations dependent on raw materials and cooking methods available locally. In the north of Russia, it incorporates local berries such as cloudberry or crowberry, fish such as cod, game meat such as elk, or even edible moss known as yagel. Conversely, in Siberia it includes the local fish varieties, particularly those of the coregonus genus such as arctic cisco or muksun, and borrows the local cooking methods, to result in raw fish eaten frozen or combined with spices. Further east, local specialties are added such as eagle fern, kolomikta fruit, scallops and Kamchatka crabs.

==Soups==
Soups have always played an important role in Russian cuisine. The traditional staple of soups such as shchi (), borscht (), ukha (), rassolnik (), solyanka (), botvinya (), okroshka (), and tyurya () was enlarged in the 18th to 20th centuries by both European and Central Asian staples like clear soups, pureed soups, stews, and many others.

Russian soups can be divided into at least seven large groups:
* Chilled soups based on kvass, such as tyurya, okroshka, and botvinya.
* Light soups and stews based on water and vegetables, such as svekolnik. 
* Noodle soups with meat, mushrooms, or milk.
* Soups based on cabbage, most prominently shchi.
* Thick soups based on meat broth, with a salty-sour base like rassolnik and solyanka.
* Fish soups such as ukha.
* Grain- and vegetable-based soups.

===Cold soups===
&quot;Okroshka&quot; is a cold soup based on kvass or (less frequently) various kinds of sour milk; kefir is often preferred nowadays. Okroshka is also a salad. The main ingredients are two types of vegetables that can be mixed with cold boiled meat or fish in a 1:1 proportion. Thus vegetable, meat, poultry, and fish varieties of okroshka are made.

There are typically two types of vegetables in okroshka. The first must have a neutral taste, such as boiled potatoes, turnips, rutabagas, carrots, or fresh cucumbers. The second must be spicy and aromatic, like radishes or green onion as well as other herbs—greens of dill, parsley, chervil, celery, or tarragon. Different meat and poultry can be used in the same soup. The most common ingredient is beef alone or with poultry. A mild bologna-like sausage is sometimes used. If it is made with fish, the best choice would be tench, European perch, pike-perch, cod, or other neutral-tasting fish. In the coastal areas smoked and/or salted salmon is preferred instead, often in combination with other meats.

The kvass most commonly used in cooking is white okroshka kvass, which is much more sour than drinking kvass. Spices used include mustard, black pepper and pickled cucumber (specifically, the liquid from the pickles), solely or in combination. For the final touch, boiled eggs and smetana (similar to crème fraîche) are added. Often, the mustard, chopped hard-boiled yolks, pepper and pickle brine are combined into a spicy sauce that is added to the soup to taste.

For sour milk-based okroshka, well-shaken natural sour milk (often with the addition of seed oil) is used with the addition of pure water and ground garlic. Sometimes manufactured kefir is used instead of natural sour milk for time-saving reasons, though some say it detracts from the original taste of &quot;okroshka&quot;.

&quot;Tyurya&quot; is very similar to okroshka, the main difference being that instead of vegetables, bread, sometimes with addition of onion and vegetable oil, is soaked in kvass, similar to Silesian wodzionka or Portuguese açorda. It was commonly consumed during rough times (such as the Russian Revolution, World War I, and World War II) and by poor peasants. Also, due to its simplicity, it was very common as a meal during religious fasting.

&quot;Botvinya&quot; is another type of cold soup. The name of the soup comes from the Russian word &quot;botva&quot;, which means &quot;leafy tops of root vegetables&quot;, and, true to its name, it is made with the leafy tops of young beets, as well as sorrel, scallions, dill, cucumbers, and two types of kvass. Mustard, garlic, and horseradish are then added for flavor. The vegetables are blanched, then rubbed through a sieve, and kvass is poured over them.

&quot;Svyokolnik&quot; (also known as &quot;kholodnik&quot;) is a cold borscht. It consists of beet sour or beet juice blended with sour cream, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir or yogurt. The mixture has a distinctive orange or pink color. It is served chilled, typically over finely chopped beetroot, cucumbers, radishes and spring onion, together with halved hard-boiled eggs and sprinkled with fresh dill. Chopped veal, ham, or crawfish tails may be added as well.


===Hot soups===
&quot;Shchi&quot; (cabbage soup) had been the predominant first course in Russian cuisine for over a thousand years. Shchi knew no social class boundaries, and even if the rich had richer ingredients and the poor made it solely of cabbage and onions, all these &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;rich&quot; variations were cooked in the same tradition. The unique taste of this cabbage soup was from the fact that after cooking it was left to draw (stew) in a Russian stove. The &quot;spirit of shchi&quot; was inseparable from a Russian izba (log hut). Many Russian proverbs are connected to this soup, such as (, &quot;Shchi and porridge are our staples&quot;). It can be eaten regularly, and at any time of the year.

The richer variant of shchi includes several ingredients, but the first and last components are a must:
# Cabbage.
# Meat (very rarely fish or mushrooms).
# Carrots, basil or parsley roots.
# Spicy herbs (onions, celery, dill, garlic, pepper, bay leaf).
# Sour components (smetana, apples, sauerkraut, pickle water).

When this soup is served, smetana is added. It is eaten with rye bread. Older tradition called for thickening shchi with a sort of roux, made by scalding a portion of the flour with a boiling broth, without frying it first, to increase the soup&#x27;s caloric content, especially if the meat was not used; but about late XVIII century, and especially in the higher-class cooking, this was abandoned for the sake of the finer taste.
During much of the year when the Orthodox Christian Church prescribes abstinence from meat and dairy, a vegan version of shchi is made.
&quot;Kislye&quot; (sour) schi are made from pickled cabbage (sauerkraut), &quot;serye&quot; (grey) schi from the green outer leaves of the cabbage head. &quot;Zelyonye&quot; (green) schi are made from sorrel leaves, not cabbage, and used to be a popular summer soup.

&quot;Borscht&quot; is made of broth, beets, and tomatoes with various vegetables, including onions, cabbage, tomato, carrots, and celery. Borscht usually includes meat, particularly beef in Russia, and pork in Ukraine. Borscht is generally served very hot, with sour cream, chopped chives or parsley, and crushed garlic. Borscht is traditionally served with black bread. Borscht is associated as national cuisine in various different Eastern European countries such as Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, and Lithuania.

&quot;Ukha&quot; is a warm watery fish dish, however calling it a fish soup would not be absolutely correct. &quot;Ukha&quot; as a name for fish broth was established only in the late 17th to early 18th centuries. In earlier times this name was first given to thick meat broths, and then later chicken. Beginning from the 15th century, fish was more and more often used to prepare ukha, thus creating a dish that had a distinctive taste among soups.

A minimum of vegetables is added in preparation, and in classical cooking, ukha was simply a rich fish broth served to accompany fish pies (rasstegai, kuliebiaka, etc.). These days it is more often a fish soup, cooked with potatoes, and other vegetables. A wide variety of freshwater fish is traditionally used.

&quot;Rassolnik&quot; is a hot soup in a salty-sour cucumber base. This dish formed in Russian cuisine quite late—only in the 19th century. About this time the name rassolnik was attached to it, originating from the Russian word &quot;rassol&quot; which means &quot;brine&quot; (pickle water). Pickle water was known to be used as a base for soups from the 15th century at the latest. Its concentration and ratio with other liquids and soup components gave birth to different soups: solyanka, shchi, and of course rassolnik. The latest is moderately sour-salty soups on pickled cucumber base. Some are vegetarian, but more often with products like veal or beef kidneys or all poultry giblets (stomach, liver, heart, neck, feet). For best taste, there has to be a balance between the sour part and neutral absorbers (cereals, potatoes, root vegetables).
Typical rassolnik is based on kidneys, brine (and pickles), vegetables and barley.

&quot;Kal&#x27;ya&quot; was a very common dish first served in the 16th–17th centuries. Subsequently, it almost completely disappeared from Russian cuisine. Often it was incorrectly called &quot;fish rassolnik&quot;. The cooking technique is mostly the same as of ukha, but to the broth were added pickled cucumbers, pickle water, lemons and lemon juice, either separately or all together. The main characteristic of kal&#x27;ya is that only fat, rich fish was used; sometimes caviar was added along with the fish. More spices are added, and the soup turns out more piquant and thicker than ukha. Formerly kal&#x27;ya was considered a festivity dish.

&quot;Solyanka&quot; is a thick, piquant soup that combines components from shchi (cabbage, smetana) and rassolnik (pickle water and cucumbers), spices such as olives, capers, tomatoes, lemons, lemon juice, kvass, salted and pickled mushrooms make up a considerably strong sour-salty base of the soup. Solyanka is much thicker than other soups, about 1/3 less liquid ratio. Three types are distinguished: meat, fish, and simple solyanka. The first two are cooked on strong meat or fish broths, and the last on mushroom or vegetable broth. All the broths are mixed with cucumber pickle water.

&quot;Lapsha&quot; (noodle soup) was adopted by Russians from Tatars, and after some transformation became widespread in Russia. It comes in three variations: chicken, mushroom, and milk. Cooking all three is simple, including preparation of noodles, cooking of corresponding broth, and boiling of noodles in broth. Noodles are based on the same wheat flour or buckwheat/wheat flour mix. Mixed flour noodles go better with mushroom or milk broth.

==Salads==
Olivier salad (also known as Russian salad) is a mayonnaise-based potato salad distinguished by its diced texture and the contrasting flavors of pickles, hard-boiled eggs, boiled carrots, boiled potatoes, meat, and peas. This dish is one of the main features of New Year buffets.

&quot;&quot; (or , from ), also known as &quot;dressed herring&quot;, is chopped salted herring under a &quot;coat&quot; of shredded cooked beet, sometimes with a layer of egg or other vegetables.

&quot;&quot; (from French ) is a salad made of boiled beets, potatoes, carrots, pickles, onions, sauerkraut, and sometimes peas or white beans. It is dressed with sunflower or olive oil.

==Porridge==
Porridge is one of the most important dishes in traditional Russian cuisine. The variety of cereals is based on the local variety of crops. In Russian, the word kasha refers to any kind of porridge.

The most popular cereals are buckwheat, millet, semolina, oats, barley, and rice. Traditionally, such cereal porridge is cooked in milk, especially if it is to be served for breakfast. Butter, salt, sugar, jams, fresh fruit and berries may be added.

Plain cooked porridges, especially buckwheat and rice, may be served as a side dish with other meals.

Canned meat, &quot;tushonka&quot;, is made with buckwheat/rice &quot;kasha&quot; traditions in mind, unlike the bully beef type of canned meat. While average-priced &quot;tushyonka&quot; contains a large portion of lard and jelly, this very non-meaty addition to meat can be used as a sauce for enriching rice or buckwheat kasha&#x27;s taste.

==Main dishes==

===Meat===
In traditional Russian cuisine three basic variations of meat dishes can be highlighted:
* a large boiled piece of meat cooked in a soup or porridge, and then used as the second course or served cold (particularly in jellied stock such as &quot;kholodets&quot;, below)
* offal dishes (liver, tripe, etc.), baked in pots together with cereals;
* whole fowl dishes or parts of fowl (legs or breasts), or a large piece of meat (rump) baked on a baking tray in an oven, so-called &quot;zharkoye&quot; (from the word &quot;zhar&quot;(жар) meaning &quot;heat&quot;)
at affluent households also mentions sausage-making, spit-roasted meats, stews and many other meat dishes.

As a garnish to meat dishes in the past the most common were porridges and cereals, in which the meat was boiled, later on boiled or rather steamed and baked root vegetables (turnips, carrots) as well as mushrooms; additionally the meat, without taking account its type, was garnished with pickled products—pickled cabbage, or sour and &quot;soaked&quot; (marinated) apples (mochoniye yabloki) or cranberries. Pan juices, alone or mixed with sour cream or melted butter, were used as gravy to pour on garnishing vegetables and porridges. Meat sauces, i.e. gravies based on flour, butter, eggs and milk, are not common for traditional Russian cuisine.

&quot;Pelmeni&quot; are a traditional Eastern European (mainly Russian) dish usually made with minced meat filling, wrapped in thin dough (made out of flour and eggs, sometimes with milk or water added). For filling, pork, lamb, beef, or any other kind of meat can be used; mixing several kinds is popular. The traditional Ural recipe requires the filling be made with 45% of beef, 35% of lamb, and 20% of pork. Traditionally, various spices, such as pepper, onions, and garlic, are mixed into the filling.

Russians seem to have learned to make pelmeni from Finno-Ugric people. The word means &quot;ear-shaped bread&quot; in Finno-Ugric languages such as Udmurt and Komi; &quot;pel&quot;&#x27; means &#x27;ear&#x27; and &quot;n&#x27;an&quot; means &#x27;bread&#x27;. In Siberia they were made in large quantities and stored safely frozen outside for several winter months. In mainland Russia, the term &quot;Siberian &quot;pel&#x27;meni&quot;&quot; refers to &quot;pel&#x27;meni&quot; made with a mix of meats (whether the 45/35/20 mix mentioned above or another ratio), rather than a single meat. By the late 19th century, they became a staple throughout urban European Russia. They are prepared immediately before eating by boiling in water until they float, and then 2–5 minutes more. The resulting dish is served with butter or sour cream (mustard, horseradish, and vinegar are popular as well). Some recipes suggest frying pelmeni after boiling until they turn golden brown.

Pelmeni belong to the family of dumplings. They are akin to vareniki, a Ukrainian variety of dumplings with a filling made of, most commonly, mashed potatoes, farmer&#x27;s cheese, or cherries. They are not dissimilar to Chinese potstickers, Tibetan mo-mo and Italian ravioli, as well as the manti of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz cultures. The main difference between pelmeni and other kinds of dumplings is in their shape and size; the typical pelmen&#x27; is roughly spherical and is about 2 to 3 cm in diameter, whereas most other types of dumplings are usually elongated and much larger.

The process of making pelmeni is somewhat labor-intensive, but a &quot;pelmennitsa&quot; greatly speeds up the task. This device typically consists of a round aluminum plate with a matrix of holes surrounded by ridges. A sheet of dough is placed over the matrix, a filling is scooped into each &quot;cell&quot;, and the dough sags under the weight of the filling, forming the body of the dumpling. Another sheet of dough is placed on top, and a wooden roller is rolled over the top, pressing the dough layers together, cutting the dumplings apart by the ridges, and forcing the dumplings to fall through the holes. Using a &quot;pelmennitsa&quot;, the chef can quickly manufacture batches of dumplings at a time.

Various minced meat dishes were adopted from other cuisines and became popular only in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; for traditional Russian cuisine, they are not typical.

&quot;Kotlety&quot; (minced cutlets) are pan-fried cutlet-shaped patties, not dissimilar from Salisbury steak and other such dishes. Kotlety are made from pork and beef, or from chicken, sometimes also from fish. In common recipes, ground meat, pork, onions and bread are put in a bowl and mixed thoroughly until it becomes relatively consistent. Once this effect is achieved, patties are formed and then put into a hot frying pan to cook. Pozharsky cutlet is a more elaborated version which was adopted by French haute cuisine.

&quot;Beef Stroganoff&quot;: Sautéed pieces of beef served in a sauce with smetana (sour cream). From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe.

&quot;Shashlyk&quot; is a form of shish kebab (marinated meat grilled on a skewer) popular in former Soviet Union countries, notably in Georgia, Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. It often features alternating slices of meat and onions. Even though the word &quot;shashlyk&quot; was apparently borrowed from the Crimean Tatars by the Cossacks as early as the 18th century, kebabs did not reach Moscow until the late 19th century, according to Vladimir Gilyarovsky&#x27;s &quot;Moscow and Moscovites&quot;. From then on, their popularity spread rapidly; by the 1910s they were a staple in St. Petersburg restaurants and by the 1920s they were already a ubiquitous street food all over urban Russia. Shashlik is also used in Russia as a food to be cooked in an outdoor environment, similarly to barbecue in English-speaking countries.

&quot;Kholodets&quot; (or &quot;studen&quot;&#x27;): Jellied chopped pieces of pork or veal meat with some spices added (pepper, parsley, garlic, bay leaf) and minor amounts of vegetables (carrots, onions). The meat is boiled in large pieces for long periods of time, then chopped, boiled a few times again and finally chilled for 3–4 hours (hence the name) forming a jelly mass, though gelatin is not used because calves&#x27; feet, pigs&#x27; heads and other such offal is gelatinous enough on its own. It is served with horseradish, mustard, or ground garlic with smetana.

&quot;Gulyash&quot; is also a very popular dish in Russia. Of course, this is the Austro-Hungarian dish Goulash originally, but it was still very popular in the USSR. It had its place in domestic cuisine, and was served in Soviet canteens in plants and factories.

===Fish===
Fish was important in pre-revolutionary cuisine, especially on Russian Orthodox fast days when meat was forbidden, similar to the Catholic custom of eating fish instead of meat on Fridays. Strictly freshwater fish such as carp and sudak (Sander lucioperca, Zander) were commonly eaten in inland areas, as well as anadromous sturgeon and in northern areas salmon, pike and trout. A greater variety of fish—including saltwater species—were preserved by salting, pickling or smoking and consumed as &quot;zakuski&quot; (hors d&#x27;oeuvres).

==== Selyodka pod shuboi (dressed herring)====

There is a dish in modern Russian cuisine resembling a mix of &quot;svekolnik&quot; and pickled herring: &quot;selyodka pod shuboi&quot;, literally &quot;[fur]coated (dressed) herring&quot;, where pickled herring is coated with a layer of potatoes, a layer of mayo and/or &quot;smetana&quot; sour cream, with grated beet added on top for coating (hence &quot;fur&quot;-coat&quot; word, &quot;shuba&quot;).

===Vegetables===
Cabbage, potatoes, and cold-tolerant greens are common in Russian and other Eastern European cuisines. Pickling cabbage (sauerkraut), cucumbers, tomatoes and other vegetables in brine is used to preserve vegetables for winter use. Pickled apples and some other fruit also used to be widely popular. These are sources of vitamins during periods when fresh fruit and vegetables are traditionally not available.

==Desserts and pastries==

The earliest form of the honey bread was made with just rye flour, honey and berry juice, arriving in Russia by way of Egypt in the 9th century. Later preparations dating to the 12th and 13th centuries included spices purchased in the markets of India and the Middle east. Tula gingerbread is known as early as 1685, and was historically made by well-known confectioners with gingerbread molds hand carved into planks of wood taken from local birch and pear trees.

Pirozhki (singular: pirozhok; diminutive of pirog [pie]) are small stuffed buns (pies) made of either yeast dough or short pastry. They are filled with one of many different fillings and are either baked (the ancient Slavic method) or shallow-fried (known as &quot;priazhenie&quot;, this method was borrowed from the Tatars in the 13th century). One feature of pirozhki that sets them apart from, for example, English pies is that the fillings used are almost invariably fully cooked. The use of chopped hard-boiled eggs in fillings is another interesting feature. Six typical fillings for traditional pirozhki are:

# Chopped boiled meat mixed with sautéed onions
# Rice and boiled eggs with dill
# Fish sautéed with onions and mixed with hard-boiled chopped eggs and rice
# Mashed potatoes mixed with dill and green onion
# Sautéed cabbage
# Sautéed mushrooms with onions and sometimes carrots

Polish pierogi (type: dumplings) are not really related to Russian &quot;pirogi&quot; (type: pies) and &quot;pirozhki&quot; (type: buns, small pies)

Blin are thin griddle cakes similar to crepes traditionally made with buckwheat flour and yeasted batter, although non-yeasted batter has become widespread in recent times. They may be topped or filled with butter, smetana (sour cream), fruit preserves or caviar. Blini are often served in connection with &quot;Maslenitsa&quot; (Масленица, Butter Week; also known as Pancake Week), a springtime religious festival celebrated before Lent, but it is also a common breakfast dish. The word &quot;blin&quot; (singular of blini) comes from Old Slavic &quot;mlin&quot;, which means &quot;to mill&quot;.
Blin had a somewhat ritual significance for early Slavic peoples in pre-Christian times since they were a symbol of the sun, due to their round form. They were traditionally prepared at the end of the winter to honor the rebirth of the new sun during &quot;Maslenitsa&quot;. This tradition was adopted by the Orthodox Church and is carried on to the present day, as the last week of dairy and egg products before Lent. Bliny are still often served at wakes, to commemorate the recently deceased. Blini can be made from wheat, buckwheat, or other grains, although wheat blini are most popular in Russia. 
The word &quot;blin&quot; is also often used as a soft curse word, expressing frustration. This practice originates from the word&#x27;s phonetic similarity to the much more vulgar word &quot;Blyádt&quot;.

Syrniki are fried curd fritters, garnished with sour cream, jam, honey or applesauce.

Vatrushka is a kind of cake with a ring of dough and tvorog (cottage cheese) in the middle, often with raisins or bits of fruit, from about five inches to two and a half feet in diameter.

Kulich is a kind of Easter bread that is traditional in the Orthodox Christian faith and is eaten in countries like Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, Moldova, North Macedonia and Serbia.

Traditionally after the Easter service, the kulich, which has been put into a basket and decorated with colorful flowers, is blessed by the priest. Blessed kulich is eaten before breakfast each day. Any leftover kulich that is not blessed is eaten with Paskha for dessert.

Kulich is baked in tall, cylindrical tins (like coffee or fruit juice tins). When cooled, kulich is decorated with white icing (which slightly drizzles down the sides) and colorful flowers. Historically, it was often served with cheese paska bearing the symbol XB (from the traditional Easter greeting of &quot;Христос воскресе&quot;, &quot;Christ is Risen&quot;).

Kulich is only eaten between Easter and Pentecost.

The recipe for kulich is similar to that of Italian panettone.

&quot;Paskha&quot; is a festive dish made in Eastern Orthodox countries which consists of food that is forbidden during the fast of Great Lent. It is made during Holy Week and then brought to Church on Great Saturday to be blessed after the Paschal Vigil. The name of the dish comes from Pascha, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of Easter.

Cheese paskha is a traditional Easter dish made from quark (curd cheese, ), which is white, symbolizing the purity of Christ, the Paschal Lamb, and the joy of the Resurrection. It is formed in a mould, traditionally in the shape of a truncated pyramid (a symbol of the Church; this form is also said to represent the Tomb of Christ). It is usually served as an accompaniment to a rich Easter bread called paska in Ukrainian and kulich in Russian.

The pascha is decorated with traditional religious symbols, such as the &quot;Chi Ro&quot; motif, a three-bar cross, and the letters &quot;X&quot; and &quot;B&quot; (Cyrillic letters which stands for &quot;Христосъ Воскресе.&quot; This is the Slavonic form of the traditional Paschal greeting: &quot;Christ is Risen!&quot;). All of these religious decorations symbolize Christ&#x27;s Passion and Resurrection.

&quot;Varenye&quot; is a dessert and condiment. It is made from cooking fruits or berries. It is similar to jam except that fruits are not macerated and the consistency is more akin to fruit within syrup. It is used as a topping for crepes and syrniki and as a sweetener for tea. It is also eaten on its own as a sweet.

&quot;Pastila&quot; is a fruit confectionery (&quot;pâte de fruits&quot;). It has been described as &quot;small squares of pressed fruit paste&quot; and &quot;light, airy puffs with a delicate apple flavor&quot;. In Imperial Russia, the &quot;small jellied sweetmeats&quot; were served for tea &quot;with a white foamy top, a bit like marshmallow, but tasting of pure fruit&quot;. In its modern form, it is essentially fruit meringue, but baked to a soft, not crisp consistency. Unlike its derivative zefir, true pastila does not use gelling agents and has a much lower egg white content.

&quot;Zefir&quot; (may also be spelled &quot;zephyr&quot; or &quot;zephir&quot;) is a type of soft confectionery made by whipping fruit and berry purée (mostly apple puree) with sugar and egg whites with subsequent addition of a gelling agent like pectin, carrageenan, agar, or gelatine. It is commonly produced and sold in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The name given after the Greek god of the light west wind Zephyr symbolizes its delicate airy consistency.

Zefir is somewhat similar in its consistency to marshmallows, Schokokuss or krembo. It is derived from the traditional Russian pastila but with added egg white foam and a gelling agent. The form typically resembles traditional meringue. However, in contrast to commercial meringue, it is never crisp. It is usually of white or rose color.

Chocolate-coated versions are also widespread. In contrast to the other chocolate-coated marshmallow-like confectioneries they normally do not include a biscuit layer.

&quot;Kissel&quot; or &quot;kisel&quot; is a viscous fruit dish, popular as a dessert and as a drink. It consists of the sweetened juice of berries, like mors, but it is thickened with cornstarch, potato starch or arrowroot; sometimes red wine or fresh or dried fruits are added. It is similar to the Danish &quot;rødgrød&quot; and German &quot;Rote Grütze&quot;. Swedish &quot;blåbärssoppa&quot; is a similarly prepared bilberry dessert, although only fresh or frozen bilberries, not dried berries are used to prepare it.

Kissel can be served either hot or cold, also together with sweetened quark or semolina pudding. Kissel can also be served on pancakes or with ice cream. If the kissel is made using less thickening starch, it can be drunk—this is common in Russia and Ukraine.

==Beverages==

Many traditional drinks are indigenous to Russia and are not present in other national cuisines. The most notable of these are vodka, sbiten&#x27;, kvass, medovukha and mors. Many of them are no longer common and have been replaced by drinks originating in Europe. Nonetheless, these beverages were formerly drunk as a complement to meat and poultry dishes, sweet porridge, and dessert. Of particular note is sbiten, an immensely popular medieval drink which has since been replaced by tea as the Russian mainstay beverage.

===Alcoholic===

Of Russia&#x27;s alcoholic beverages, perhaps the most ancient is Medovukha, a sweet, low-alcohol drink, made with fermented honey with the addition of various spices. A stronger honey-based beverage, &quot;stavlenniy myod&quot;, also exists in Russia and is broadly equivalent to Scandinavian mead; it is typically made with the admixture of berry juices.

Vodka is the best known of Russia&#x27;s alcoholic products and is produced, with some variation, throughout the country. Vodka can be either grain or potato based and is frequently flavored with a great variety of ingredients ranging from hot-pepper and horseradish to fruits and berries.

Beer has been manufactured in Russia since at the very least the 9th century. Its popularity was for many centuries concentrated in the Lands of Novgorod. Beer continued to be made throughout Russian history, but real growth came in the 18th century when many breweries were founded in order to supply the newly modernized and expanded imperial army and fleet. A real explosion in the popularity of beer came in the last decades of the Soviet Era and has continued into the present day, with Russia now ranking as the fourth largest producer in the world.

Wine is manufactured in the southern regions in the country but lags far behind other alcoholic beverages in popularity. The wine industry, which was somewhat notable in imperial times, is slowly expanding, but most Russians that drink wine tend to prefer imported foreign varieties, especially sweet varieties produced in the countries of the former USSR and little known in the outside world.

===Non-alcoholic===
Most non-alcoholic Russian drinks are based on fruits and berries. Those include kompot, made by boiling fruit with sweetened water; uzvar, in which dried fruit is used instead; mors, made of berries such as lingonberry, cranberry, blueberries, or raspberries; and kisel, a viscous fruit drink thickened with cornstarch, potato starch or arrowroot.

Kvass is an ancient and still widely popular bread-based drink. The basic method of preparing kvass includes water, flour and liquid malt; these ingredients are used to make a dough that is subjected to fermentation. This results in a beverage with very low alcohol content. Commercial kvass is often around 0.5% alcohol. The fermented liquid, referred to as &quot;zator&quot;, is diluted with water and mixed with yeast, sugar, and aromatic additives. This final mixture is allowed to brew for several days. Flavor additives may include fruit and berry juices (cherry, raspberry, lemon, etc.), as well as ginger and mint.

Sbiten, another non-alcoholic drink, is made of honey, water, fruit juices, and spices. Sbiten was once the most popular non-alcoholic beverage in the country, but in the last few centuries, it has been superseded and largely replaced by tea and coffee.

Tea is by far the most common drink in almost all parts of Russia. First introduced from China in the 17th century, its popularity has since spread throughout the country. Black tea has always been the dominant variety, but after the Russian acquisition of Central Asia, awareness of and interest in green tea began to increase slowly. Today Russia remains one of the largest tea consumers in the world. Russian Caravan is perhaps the most well-known type of Russian tea around the world.

Until the Sino-Soviet split, tea was mostly brought in from China. Now, Russia imports most of its tea from India and Sri Lanka, with Darjeeling being the most prized variety. Domestic cultivation exists in the southern regions of the country (mostly in Krasnodar Krai), but local supply is very limited compared to national consumption.

Coffee is also popular but has never caught up to tea in popularity. Peter the Great is credited with introducing coffee to Russia, with the drink becoming steadily more pervasive since that time. Coffee is commonly made either using the Turkish or common European methods.

<text>Jean Antoine Letronne (25 January 1787 – 14 December 1848) was a French archaeologist.

== Life ==
Letronne was born in Paris. His father, a poor engraver, sent him to study art under the painter David, but his own tastes were literary, and he became a student in the Collège de France, where it is said he used to exercise his already strongly developed critical faculty by correcting old translations of Greek authors and afterwards comparing the results with the latest and most approved editions.
From 1810 to 1812 he travelled in France, Switzerland and Italy, and on his return to Paris published a paper entitled &quot;Essai critique sur la topographie de Syracuse&quot;, designed to elucidate Thucydides. Two years later appeared his &quot;Recherches geographiques et critiques on the De Mensura Orbis Terrae of Dicuil&quot;. In 1815 he was commissioned by government to complete the translation of Strabo which had been begun by François-Jean-Gabriel de La Porte du Theil, and in March 1816 he was one of those who were admitted to the Academy of Inscriptions by royal ordinance, having previously contributed &quot;On the Metrical System of the Egyptians&quot;.

Further promotion came rapidly: in 1817 he was appointed director of the École Nationale des Chartes, in 1829 inspector-general of the university, and in 1831 professor of history in the Collège de France. This chair he exchanged in 1838 for that of archaeology, and in 1840 he succeeded Pierre Claude François Daunou as keeper of the national archives.

Meanwhile, he published, among other works, &quot;Considérations générales sur l&#x27;évaluation des monnaies grecques et romaines, et sur la valeur de l&#x27;or et de l&#x27;argent avant la découverte de l&#x27;Amérique&quot; in 1817, &quot;Recherches pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;Egypte pendant la domination des Grecs et des Romains&quot; in 1823, and &quot;Sur l&#x27;origine grecque des zodiaques pretendus egyptiens&quot; in 1837. By the last-named he finally exploded a fallacy which had up to that time vitiated the chronology of contemporary Egyptologists. His &quot;Diplômes et chartes de l&#x27;époque mérovingienne, sur papyrus et sur vélin&quot; were published in 1844. The most important work of Letronne is the &quot;Recueil des inscriptions grecques et latines de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;, of which the first volume appeared in 1842, and the second in 1848.

Letronne is also known as one of the earliest proponents of the Flat Earth Myth.

<text>Francis Joseph Collin (born November 3, 1944) is an American former political activist and Midwest coordinator with the American Nazi Party, later known as the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party. After being ousted for being partly Jewish (which he denied), in 1970, Collin founded the National Socialist Party of America. (N.S.P.A.) In the late 1970s, his planned march in the predominantly Jewish suburb of Skokie, Illinois was challenged; however, the American Civil Liberties Union defended Collin&#x27;s group&#x27;s freedom of speech and assembly in a case that reached the United States Supreme Court to correct procedural deficiencies. Specifically, the necessity of immediate appellate review of orders restraining the exercise of First Amendment rights was strongly emphasized in &quot;National Socialist Party v. Village of Skokie&quot;, 432 U.S. 43 (1977). Afterward, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the party had a right to march and to display swastikas, despite local opposition, based on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Collin then offered a compromise, offering to march in Chicago&#x27;s Marquette Park (where Martin Luther King had been attacked in 1966) instead of Skokie. After Collin was convicted and sentenced in 1979 for child molestation, he lost his position in the party.

After being released early on parole from prison, Collin created a new career as a writer, publishing numerous books under the pen name Frank Joseph. He wrote New Age and hyperdiffusionist works supporting the pseudoarchaeological idea that Old World peoples had migrated to North America in ancient times and created its complex societies of indigenous peoples. This thesis is rejected by mainstream scholars.

==Early life, family and education==
Collin was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, where he attended local schools. His father, Max Frank Collin, was born Max Simon Cohn in Munich, Germany, on August 23, 1913, the son of Jewish parents who were murdered in The Holocaust, and was a survivor of Dachau concentration camp. Frank&#x27;s mother, Virginia Gertrude née Hardyman, was born in Chicago on August 18, 1920, and was Catholic.

==Adult life and career==
As a young man, Collin in the 1960s joined George Lincoln Rockwell&#x27;s National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party. He became the Midwest coordinator. He broke with the NSWPP due to a disagreement with Rockwell&#x27;s successor, Matt Koehl, who was elected as the party leader by popular vote after Rockwell was assassinated on August 25, 1967. The falling out stemmed in part from published accounts by Max Collin, Frank&#x27;s father, who said that he was a Jewish Holocaust survivor and had changed his name from Cohen (or Cohn) to Collin. Frank Collin denied having Jewish roots and maintained that his father was not telling the truth.

In 1970, Collin formed another organization, the National Socialist Party of America (NSPA), later known as the American Nazi Party. It attracted other disaffected members of the NSWPP, as well as Michael Allen, Gary Lauck and Harold Covington. Covington helped buy a building for the group which they called Rockwell Hall, where Collin and some other members lived in a barracks in upper floor. Collin ran for alderman of Chicago in 1975 and pulled 16% of the vote.

The NSPA began holding anti-black demonstrations in Chicago&#x27;s Marquette Park. The Chicago authorities became concerned about violence and passed an ordinance which required demonstrations to post large insurance bonds. Collin went to the ACLU and they filed a suit. While the case was proceeding without public notice, Collin attempted to contact other cities about holding demonstrations. Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, responded with a notice that the group would need to post a bond, similar to the recently enacted ordinance in Chicago. Collin&#x27;s plan for his neo-Nazi group to march in uniforms through Skokie, which was heavily Jewish with numerous residents who were Holocaust survivors, generated public outrage and the media attention which Collin sought.

Also in 1977, Koehl&#x27;s NSWPP began a campaign in their paper &quot;White Power&quot; about Collin&#x27;s father being Jewish, including publications of what they stated were Max Simon Cohn&#x27;s naturalization records. Collin and the NSPA leadership continued to deny the claim and said the images were fakes.

===Child molestation conviction===
During this time, according to Jeffrey Kaplan, Covington found pictures in Frank Collin&#x27;s desk that linked Collin to the sexual abuse of young boys. In what Kaplan described as a play for power in the organization, Covington and the other NSPA members turned the evidence on Collin over to the police. After Collin was arrested, Covington took over leadership of the NSPA and moved the headquarters from Chicago to North Carolina. A 1980 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Frank Collin was expelled from the American Nazi Party for illicit intercourse with minors and the use of Nazi headquarters in Chicago for purposes of sodomy with children. The report indicates that the Nazis &quot;tipped&quot; the police who arrested Collin.&quot; Collin was convicted of child molestation and sentenced to seven years in prison at the Pontiac Correctional Center in 1979. He served three years.

==Author==
Upon his release from prison, Collin &quot;reinvented himself under the pseudonym of Frank Joseph, a New Age writer and a pagan worshiper&quot;. His time in the Pontiac Correctional Facility in Illinois had coincided with the period when Russell E. Burrows worked there as a prison guard. He subsequently wrote many books and articles in support of Burrows Cave, an alleged cache of ancient treasure in an unrevealed location, supposedly discovered by Russell Burrows in southern Illinois.&quot; In 1987, he had his first New Age book published, &quot;The Destruction of Atlantis: Compelling Evidence of the Sudden Fall of the Legendary Civilization&quot;.

He wrote articles for &quot;Fate&quot; magazine, and he was also the editor of &quot;The Ancient American&quot; magazine. &quot;The Ancient American&quot; focuses on what it says is evidence of ancient, pre-Columbian transoceanic contact between the Old World and North America, with the implication that all complex aspects of North America&#x27;s indigenous cultures must have originated on other continents. The magazine&#x27;s claims are similar to discredited nineteenth century theories, and as a result, they are considered dubious or exploitative by scholars.

<text>Bury Grammar School is a 3–18 private day school for boys in Bury, Greater Manchester, England, that has existed since c.1570. It is now part of a group of schools for preschool, junior, senior and sixth form studies.

Since 2017, when Bury Grammar School (Boys) and Bury Grammar School (Girls) amalgamated, Jo Anderson has been the first principal of the School and is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. 

== History ==
===Establishment===

There is evidence that a grammar school attached to Bury Parish Church existed as early as 1570 but the school was certainly well established by 1634 with Henry Dunster as its fourth recorded headmaster. Former headmaster, Rev&#x27;d Henry Bury, who was by then &quot;aged eighty nine yeares or thereabout&quot;, wrote his will in that year. In it, he not only left the sum of twenty shillings to Dunster (&quot;that studious and painfull minister&quot;) but also an endowment of £300 to the &quot;ffree school&quot; at Bury &quot;for and towards the yearlie mentayninge of a school maister there, for to teach their children.&quot;

Rev&#x27;d Roger Kay had gained his BA in 1688, his MA in 1691 and had become a Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He also later became Rector of Fittleton in Wiltshire and was a prebendary of Salisbury until his death. In 1726, he left money in his will to support the library at St John&#x27;s College, but also a substantial part of his estate to re-founding his &quot;alma mater&quot; in his home town of Bury. The building in which Kay&#x27;s newly re-founded school educated the boys of Bury still stands today, known as Blackburn Hall, in the Wylde behind the Parish Church. (The hall is named after a former Rector of Bury, Ven. Foster Blackburne MA(Oxon), who was also Archdeacon of Manchester and Chairman of Governors of Bury G S. Archdeacon Blackburn was credited with producing the lyrics for a school song. It is not used as the official school song today.)

===Expansion===

The school outgrew its premises and, in 1903, the boys moved into the completed half of a new building on Tenterden Street, with playing fields across Bridge Road. The new buildings, of Accrington brick, were designed in a simple Neo-Renaissance style by William Venn Gough. (The playing fields were a bone of contention from the first. One writer noted in an early edition of &quot;The Clavian&quot; that &quot;the young folks of Bury refused to recognize our right to the ground&quot;.

The boys were soon joined by the girls of the Bury Girls&#x27; High School, newly re-founded as Bury Grammar School for Girls. The two schools, whilst remaining separate entities, shared the same building until the erection of a more modern facility for the boys across Bridge Road in the 1960s. This new boys&#x27; school was built on the playing fields, so the Governors purchased of land at Buckley Wells for new playing fields. When a new courthouse was completed on Tenters Street, the Magistrates&#x27; Court and County Court vacated their former building on Tenterden Street. The Prep Department of the boys&#x27; school moved across the road from the 1960s building into the refurbished old courthouse.

===Direct grant grammar school===

The school was a direct grant grammar school from 1944 until the abolition of the direct grant system in 1976, when it became fully independent once again. The school celebrated the 250th anniversary of its re-founding by Roger Kay with a visit from Prince Philip on 19 November 1976.

Bury Grammar Schools celebrate their Founders&#x27; Day on the Friday closest to 6 May (the Feast of St John before the Latin Gate), the date on which Roger Kay specified the Trustees should meet annually to inspect the schools. The Eucharist is celebrated in the Parish Church and, later in the morning, a procession leads from the school through the main streets of Bury to the Parish Church, led by the Combined Cadet Force (CCF). Since the CCF (founded 1892) is attached to the Lancashire Fusiliers, a regiment with the Freedom of the Borough, the cadets are permitted to march with &quot;swords drawn, drums beating and colours flying&quot;. After a commemoration service, the pupils are awarded a half-holiday. Services for younger pupils are held simultaneously in the boys&#x27; school hall, the boys&#x27; preparatory school and the Roger Kay Hall (in the girls&#x27; school).

===Headmasters===

=== Notable masters ===
*Henry Dunster (1609–1659), first president of Harvard College. A native of Bury and Old Clavian, he was the fourth headmaster of the school prior to his emigration to Massachusetts in 1640.
*John Just (1797–1852), Second Master 1832–52. A noted botanist, he lectured at the Royal Manchester School of Medicine and Surgery, and was honorary professor of botany at the Royal Manchester Institution.

==Overview==
=== Crest ===

The school&#x27;s crest dates from c.1840. It depicts a swan holding a key in its beak, under which is the motto in (). Both are considered to have been created by Rev&#x27;d Henry Crewe Boutflower, headmaster 1823–58. The tenacious swan was used by John, Duke of Berry in the manuscripts known as the Très Riches Heures. Berry may have been an ancestor of Henry Bury, but was more likely chosen due to the similarity in their names, whilst the key is believed to be a play on the name of the re-founder, Roger Kay.

In a letter to the editor in the first edition of the &quot;Bury Grammar School Magazine&quot; of September 1881, a correspondent asked:

The following edition carried a reply:

Thus began references to the tenacious swan of Bury as &quot;The Irwell Duck&quot;.

===Harvard College and Henry Dunster Society ===

The Henry Dunster Society, an organisation inaugurated at Harvard University in September 2008, is intended to bring together former pupils of the Bury Grammar Schools and to support initiatives for the schools. Henry Dunster was a pupil of Bury Grammar School, and then a student at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He became the curate of Bury Parish Church, and then the fourth headmaster of the school. He emigrated to Massachusetts in 1640 and was appointed the first president of Harvard College, now Harvard University.

===School fees===
The school fees in 2021 were £10,992 p.a. for senior pupils and £8,193 p.a. in the junior school.

=== Houses ===
The school has four houses, whose colours are reflected in the colour of the badge and the stripes of the tie in the school uniforms. Three houses were created in 1905 by Rev&#x27;d W H Howlett to re-introduce some of the camaraderie of a boarding school into the academic and sporting life of what was, by this time, a day school. The three houses were:
 Derby; named after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, donor of the land upon which the school stands and of considerable sums of money for the erection of the present girls&#x27; school building.
 Hulme; named after the Manchester lawyer and landowners, William Hulme and his Hulme Trust which helped to fund the new building.
 Kay; named after Rev&#x27;d Roger Kay, re-founder of the school.
In 1919, an additional house was introduced:
 Howlett; named after Fr Howlett himself.

=== Curriculum and attainment===

Boys in the prep school, housed in its own building across Tenterden Street, study the subjects of the National Curriculum – the core subjects of English, mathematics and general science, together with art, DT, geography, history, ICT, French, music, PSHEE and RS. In addition, all boys have PPE, Swimming and Games on their timetable.

All boys study English language, English literature, maths and chemistry, biology and physics as individual subjects. Boys must also take either French, German or Spanish. Latin used to be compulsory in the first, second and third forms. In addition to these compulsory subjects, boys opt for a combination of other subjects from a range including art, business studies, electronics, geography, history, ICT, music, PE and RS.

GCSE examinations are taken in the 5th Year, including French, German and Spanish. Pupils sit the IGCSE mathematics, English language and English literature examinations, administered by Edexcel. Subsequently, the media report the school as having a 0% pass rate at GCSE in maths and English, since IGCSEs are not counted as GCSE passes by the Office for National Statistics.

Having successfully completed their GCSEs in the 5th year, boys may opt to stay on into the 6th form for a further two years. Sixth form teaching offers study towards &#x27;A&#x27; level in all of the subjects offered at GCSE, along with geology, economics, further maths, philosophy, politics and psychology (which is taught in the girls&#x27; school).

== Extra curricular ==

=== Sport ===
PE and games lessons are part of every boy&#x27;s timetable, but there is a range of opportunities for extra curricular sport in the school. Sports offered include Association football, athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, fencing, hockey, gymnastics, Rugby football and tennis. The school has a swimming pool and a large sports hall with weights room. Summer 2016 saw the addition of a series of all-weather playing surfaces between the sports hall and the river. Boys play competitively both in inter-house competitions and in extramural matches, as well as sending representatives to regional and national teams, such as the ISFA.

=== Performing arts ===
The school has a long tradition of musical and dramatic performance, with performances of Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; noted in &quot;The Clavian&quot; of 1912 whilst a &quot;little musical programme was put together&quot; for a &quot;Kay House Social&quot; in July of the same year. The 1974 production of Dry Rot, starring John Darling and Piggy Hyde, was the favourite of that decade. Today, the school has a full spectrum of musical groups including a brass ensemble, senior and junior choirs, a concert band, an orchestra and a percussion group. The CCF has a corps of drums. Dramatic productions include both junior and senior plays, and musical productions; such performances are often produced in conjunction with the girls&#x27; school, and in recent years have included &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot;.

=== Clubs and societies ===
The first debating society was established at the school in 1907. There is a range of societies available to the Clavian of today including the ever-present chess club, photography club and debating society.

=== Publications and alumni activities ===

There are extant copies of a school magazine dating back as far as 1881. The current magazine (&quot;The Clavian&quot;) began as a termly in-house pamphlet in 1906 and is now an annual publication. &quot;The Key&quot; is a magazine produced for Alumni and friends of the school by the Development Office.

There is an active alumni group run by the Development Office and membership of the Bury Grammar Schools&#x27; Alumni Group on LinkedIn is open to Old Clavians (and Old Claviennes) who are LinkedIn members.

The Old Boys&#x27; Society has long held an Annual Dinner; the first recorded such dinner took place on 12 September 1881, after the Old Clavians -v- 1st XI cricket match. (Toasts included &quot;The Bishop and Clergy&quot;, &quot;The Army, Navy and Auxiliary Forces&quot; and &quot;The Masters&quot;.) The OBS today still organises an annual dinner, held at the school on Founders&#x27; Day each year. The Old Boys&#x27; Society (London Branch) organises an annual dinner in London for Home Counties-based Old Boys. Previously held on 6 May annually, in recent years it has moved to a Friday later in May.

The society also runs several sports teams for Old Clavians, including an association football club that fields four teams; 1st XI, Reserves, 3rd XI and Veterans.

<doc id="644147" wikidata="Q5955992" url="?curid=644147" title="Neomugicha incident">
<text>The , also known as the is the name given to the hijacking of a Japanese bus by a user of the internet forum 2channel on May 3, 2000.

==Incident==
An hour after posting a cryptic threat in a 2channel thread under the name &quot;Neomugicha&quot; (ネオむぎ茶; ), an unnamed 17-year-old hijacked a bus managed by Nishi-Nippon Railroad in Dazaifu, Fukuoka at 1:35p.m. Armed with a chef&#x27;s knife, he stabbed one passenger to death and injured two.

The hijacking was reported by 2:47p.m. by a 40year old female passenger after she was able to escape from the bus.

The Special Assault Team&#x27;s Osaka and Fukuoka teams stormed the hijacked bus and captured the teenager alive. The teenager was arrested under the Firearm and Sword Control Law and the Law for the Punishment of Extortion Involving Hostage-Taking. Due to the self-defense requirements as stipulated in the Law Concerning Execution of Duties of Police Officials, it took more than 15hours for the hostage crisis to end.

The incident was resolved on May4 at 5:03a.m.

== Aftermath ==
In 2006, the suspect was officially released from a medical reformatory facility. This action led to calls to reform the Juvenile Act, which had been law since 1948.

The Hiroshima Prefectural Police established the Hostage Rescue Team in the Hiroshima Prefectural Police&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Department as part of lessons learned from the incident.

=== Copycat crimes ===
A poster named &quot;Neoūroncha&quot; (ネオ烏龍茶; ) attempted to imitate &quot;Neomugicha&quot; by plotting to blow up the Odakyu Electric Railway in Japan and posting warnings about it on 2channel. Soon after the incident, however, the Japanese police were keeping a close eye on 2channel, so he was identified and arrested before his plan could be carried out. A poster called &quot;Neobīru&quot; (ネオビール; ) also attempted to imitate the incident, planning a terrorist attack on a railway company, but he was also arrested.

<doc id="644148" wikidata="Q13417087" url="?curid=644148" title="Evaporated milk">
<text>Evaporated milk, known in some countries as &quot;unsweetened condensed milk&quot;, is a shelf-stable canned cow’s milk product for which approximately 60% of the water has been removed from fresh milk. It differs from sweetened condensed milk, which contains added sugar and requires less processing to preserve, as the added sugar inhibits bacterial growth. The production process involves the evaporation of 60% of the water from the milk, followed by homogenization, canning and heat sterilization.

Evaporated milk consumes half the space of its nutritional equivalent in fresh milk. When the liquid product is mixed with a proportionate amount of water (125%), evaporated milk becomes the rough equivalent of fresh milk. This allows the product to have a shelf life of months or even years, depending upon the fat and sugar content, which made evaporated milk very popular before the age of refrigeration as a safe and reliable substitute for perishable fresh milk, as it could be shipped easily to locations lacking the means of safe milk production or storage.

==As infant formula==
In the 1920s and 1930s, evaporated milk became widely commercially available at low prices. The Christian Diehl Brewery, for instance, entered the business in 1922, producing Jerzee brand evaporated milk as a response to the Volstead Act. Several clinical studies from that time period suggest that babies fed evaporated milk formula thrived as well as did breastfed babies. However, modern guidelines issued by the World Health Organization consider breastfeeding, in most cases, to be healthier for the infant because of the colostrum in early milk production, as well as the specific nutritional content of human breast milk.

== Production ==
Evaporated milk is made from fresh, homogenised milk from which 60% of the water has been removed. After the water has been removed, the product is chilled, stabilised, sterilised and packaged. It is commercially sterilised at for 15 minutes. A slightly caramelised flavor results from the high heat process (Maillard reaction), and it is slightly darker in colour than fresh milk. The evaporation process concentrates the nutrients and the food energy (kcal); unreconstituted evaporated milk contains more nutrients and calories than does fresh milk per unit volume.

==Additives==
Evaporated milk generally contains disodium phosphate (to prevent coagulation) and carrageenan (to prevent solids from settling), as well as added vitamins C and D.

==Reconstitution and substitution==

Evaporated milk is sometimes used in its concentrated form in tea or coffee, or as a topping for desserts. Reconstituted evaporated milk, roughly equivalent to normal milk, is mixed one part by volume of evaporated milk with 1 1/4 parts of water.

=== In the United States ===
According to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Chapter 1, Part 131, Sub part B, Section 130 &quot;Evaporated milk&quot;, (April 2006): 

 (a) Description. Evaporated milk is the liquid food obtained by 
partial removal of water only from milk. It contains not less than 6.5 
percent by weight of milk fat, not less than 16.5 percent by weight of 
milk solids not fat, and not less than 23 percent by weight of total 
milk solids. Evaporated milk contains added vitamin D as prescribed by 
paragraph (b) of this section. It is homogenized. It is sealed in a 
container and so processed by heat, either before or after sealing, as 
to prevent spoilage.

Sections (b)–(f) of the code regulate vitamin addition, optional ingredients, methods of analysis, nomenclature and label declaration.

=== Canada ===
Evaporated milk in Canada is defined to be milk from which water has been evaporated and contains at least 25% milk solids and 7.5% milk fat. It may contain added vitamin C if a daily intake of the product contains between 60 and 75 milligrams, and may also contain vitamin D in an amount no less than 300 international units and no more than 400 international units. Disodium phosphate or sodium citrate (or both) may be added, as well as an emulsifying agent.

=== Shelf life ===
The shelf life of canned evaporated milk varies according to both its added content and its proportion of fat. For the regular unsweetened product, a shelf life of 15 months may be expected before any noticeable destabilization occurs.

== Notable producers ==
Evaporated milk is sold by several manufacturers:

* Carnation Evaporated Milk (now owned by Nestlé and licensed to Smuckers in Canada)
* Dairy Isle (Canada by ADL)
* PET Evaporated Milk (now owned by Smuckers)
* Magnolia evaporated milk - (now produced by Eagle Family Foods )
* Viking Melk (Norway) - invented by Olav Johan Sopp in 1891, a Nestlé brand since 1897
* F&amp;N Evaporated Milk
* California Farms Evaporated Milk

<doc id="644149" wikidata="Q374614" url="?curid=644149" title="Urban district (England and Wales)">
<text>In England and Wales, an urban district was a type of local government district that covered an urbanised area. Urban districts had an elected urban district council (UDC), which shared local government responsibilities with a county council.

In England and Wales, urban districts and rural districts were created in 1894 by the Local Government Act 1894 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73) as subdivisions of administrative counties. A similar model of urban and rural districts was also established in Ireland in 1899, which continued separately in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after 1921.

They replaced the earlier system of urban and rural sanitary districts (based on poor law unions) whose functions were taken over by the district councils. The district councils also had wider powers over local matters such as parks, cemeteries and local planning. An urban district usually contained a single parish, while a rural district might contain many. Urban districts were considered to have more problems with public health than rural areas, and so urban district councils had more funding and greater powers than comparable rural districts.

Urban districts normally covered smaller towns, usually with populations of fewer than 30,000. When the 1894 Act came into force on 31 December 1894 there had been 753 urban districts, of which 692 had previously been local government districts, 30 had been improvement commissioners districts and 31 were places newly given urban powers in 1894. The number of urban districts initially increased after 1894 as more places sought urban powers, but implementation of the recommendations of a series of county reviews as established by the Local Government Act 1929 saw a net decrease of 159 between 1932 and 1938. In many instances smaller urban districts were merged with their surrounding rural districts, with the result that new districts emerged covering rural as well as urban parishes. At the same time, a number of larger urban districts became municipal boroughs (as already created, in 1835 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835): these had a slightly higher status and the right to appoint a mayor.

Urban districts in the outer London area were absorbed into London Boroughs in 1965 as a consequence of the London Government Act 1963. All remaining urban districts in England and Wales were abolished in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, and replaced with a uniform system of larger districts – see &quot;Districts of England&quot; and &quot;Districts of Wales&quot; – which often covered both urban and rural areas. Many parish councils in England were created for towns previously covered by urban districts and, as a result of subsequent legislation, all urban and rural areas in Wales are today covered by 870 communities as sub-entities of 22 unitary authorities (or principal areas).

<text>Billy Leo Williams (born June 15, 1938) is an American former left fielder and coach in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played from 1959 to 1976, almost entirely for the Chicago Cubs. A six-time All-Star, Williams was named the 1961 National League (NL) Rookie of the Year after hitting 25 home runs with 86 runs batted in (RBI). A model of consistent production, he went on to provide the Cubs with at least 20 home runs and 80 RBI every year through 1973, batting over .300, hitting 30 home runs and scoring 100 runs five times each. Along with Ernie Banks and Ron Santo, Williams was one of the central figures in improving the Cubs&#x27; fortunes in the late 1960s after the club had spent 20 years in the bottom half of the league standings. His 853 RBI and 2,799 total bases in the 1960s were the most by any left-handed hitter in the major leagues.

In 1970, Williams was the runner-up in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) after leading the major leagues with 137 runs, 205 hits and 373 total bases, also hitting 42 home runs with 129 RBI, all career highs; excepting his run total, each remains the team record for left-handed hitters. In 1972, he was again the runner-up in MVP voting after winning the NL batting title with a .333 average, adding 37 home runs and 122 RBI while leading the major leagues in total bases and slugging percentage; in both years, he lost the award to Johnny Bench of the Cincinnati Reds. Williams played 1,117 consecutive games between September 1963 and September 1970, holding the NL record from 1969 to 1983. He was traded to the Oakland Athletics after the 1974 season, becoming a designated hitter in the American League (AL), and contributed 23 home runs and 81 RBI to finally reach the postseason as the team won their fifth consecutive division title.

When he retired, Williams&#x27; 426 career home runs and 4,599 total bases each ranked eighth in major league history among left-handed hitters; his 302 home runs as a left fielder trailed only Ralph Kiner in NL history. His 392 home runs, 2,510 hits, 1,353 RBI and 4,262 total bases with the Cubs are all team records for left-handed hitters, as were his 402 doubles until Mark Grace passed him in 1999. He led NL left fielders in assists and double plays four times each, and in putouts and fielding percentage three times each; at the end of his career, he ranked fifth in NL history in games in left field (1,737), and fourth in fielding percentage (.974), sixth in putouts (2,811) and total chances (3,005), and ninth in assists (116) in the NL after 1900. He later became a coach with the Cubs for nearly two decades. Williams was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987, and was selected as a member of the Cubs All-Century Team in 1999.

==Early life==
Billy Williams was born in Whistler, Alabama. His father Frank was a stevedore who had also played first base for the semipro Whistler Stars. Williams grew up in a segregated neighborhood, and attended Whistler High School. Entering professional baseball in 1956, Williams started his minor league career with the Ponca City Cubs of the Sooner State League. After returning to Ponca City in 1957 and hitting 17 home runs, Williams split 1958 between the Burlington Bees and Pueblo Bruins.

In his autobiography, Williams recalled that he had never experienced overt racial discrimination until his 1959 promotion to the Class AA San Antonio Missions in San Antonio, Texas. He was so discouraged that he left the team and went home. Buck O&#x27;Neil, the Cubs scout who had originally discovered Williams, was dispatched to Whistler, and he persuaded Williams to return to the team. During the 1959 season, he advanced to the Class AAA Fort Worth Cats and played 18 games for the Cubs after being called up in August. In 1960, he hit 26 home runs for the Class AAA Houston Buffs and played in 12 major league games after joining the Cubs in September.

==Major league career==

===Chicago Cubs===
Williams joined a Chicago Cubs team that by the early 1960s featured stars such as Ernie Banks, Ferguson Jenkins, and Ron Santo. Rogers Hornsby (winner of seven NL batting titles), who by 1960 was serving as a scout and coach in the Cubs organization, predicted Williams would someday win a batting title.

Williams debuted with the Cubs on August 6, 1959 in a 4-2 win over the Philadelphia Phillies; as an indication of the expectations placed on him, he batted third, ahead of Banks. In his first plate appearance, he grounded out but drove in a run for his first RBI. Williams picked up his first two hits three days later after being moved up to second in the order, getting a pair of singles in a 10-inning, 5-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. However, he never raised his average above .200 in 18 games, batting just .152 (5-for-33), and failing to drive in a run in his last 15 appearances. He returned to the Cubs in late September 1960, with decidedly better results. He raised his average as high as .368, with hits in his first seven games, before settling to a final .277 mark, and hit his first home run on October 1, a 2-run shot off Stan Williams in a 14-inning, 10-8 road win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1961, Williams played in 146 games and was selected as the NL Rookie of the Year. That year, he hit 25 home runs and drove in 86 runs, batting .278. In 1962, 1964, and 1965, he was named an NL All-Star. On May 1, 1964, Williams had an RBI single and then capped off a 10-run 1st inning with a grand slam in the Cubs&#x27; 11-3 road win over the Houston Colt .45s; the five RBI in one inning set a team record. He won the NL Player of the Month Award for May with a .455 average, 8 home runs, and 22 RBI. Williams struggled defensively in the first few years of his career, leading NL outfielders in errors as a rookie. By the mid-1960s, his defense was no longer seen as a serious weakness. He returned to the All-Star Game in 1968, 1972, and 1973.
In each season from 1961 to 1973, Williams hit at least 20 home runs and drove in 84 or more runs. His batting swing was smooth and efficient, with quick wrist action that allowed him to hit for both average and power despite his slender frame. Early in his career, this earned him the nickname &quot;Sweet-Swinging Billy Williams&quot;, sometimes shortened to &quot;Sweet Williams&quot; or &quot;Sweet Billy&quot;. His nickname was later referenced in the subtitle of his autobiography. He was also nicknamed &quot;Sweet-Swinging Billy from Whistler&quot;, in reference to his birthplace in Alabama. On July 17, 1966, in the second game of a road doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals, Williams hit for the cycle in the Cubs&#x27; 7-2 win, scoring after each hit; it was the seventh cycle by a Cubs player, the first natural cycle, and the second by a left-handed hitter. On May 21, 1968, he set a major league record by playing his 695th consecutive game in the outfield. On July 4, in a 7-4 loss to the Phillies, he broke Bill Nicholson&#x27;s team record of 205 home runs by a left-handed hitter. On August 21, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Atlanta Braves, he had a career-high seven RBI in the Cubs&#x27; 13-5 win. On September 10, Williams had the only three-home-run game of his career in an 8-1 win over the New York Mets, with the last coming off Nolan Ryan; the previous day, he had had four hits, including a double and a pair of home runs, in a 10-3 win over the Phillies. The five home runs in consecutive games tied a major league record. On April 9, 1969, Williams had a career-high four doubles, tying another major league record, in the Cubs&#x27; 11-3 win over the Phillies. On June 29, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Cardinals, Williams played in his 896th consecutive game, breaking Stan Musial&#x27;s NL record; he belted four hits including a double and a pair of triples in the Cubs&#x27; 12-1 victory. On September 5, his two home runs and two doubles accounted for all of the Cubs&#x27; hits in their 9-2 loss to the Pirates.
In 1970, Williams batted .322 with 42 homers and 129 RBI and finished second in the Most Valuable Player voting; surprisingly, despite batting .319 with 26 home runs and 80 RBI at the All-Star break, he was left off the All-Star team. On July 24, he had the only two hits in the Cubs&#x27; 9-0 loss to the Braves; it was the fourth time in his career that he had all of the team&#x27;s hits. Williams set an NL record for consecutive games played with 1,117 from 1963 to 1970 (this record was later eclipsed by Steve Garvey with 1,207 games played from 1975 to 1983). As his consecutive games streak began to accumulate, he was dubbed &quot;Iron Man&quot; by some writers. He co-authored a 1970 children&#x27;s book called &quot;Iron Man&quot;, about his childhood. On May 12, 1971, he became the fifth player to drive in 1,000 runs for the Cubs with his 2-run home run in a 9-4 road win over the Phillies. Three days later, Williams hit his 300th career home run in a 6-4 win over the San Diego Padres, joining Banks as the second Cub to do so, and on August 17 he picked up his 2,000th hit, an 8th-inning single in a 5-4 road loss to the Braves; he was the fifth player to reach that total with the Cubs. In 1972, he was the NL batting champion and named the Major League Player of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He paced the major leagues in batting average with a .333 mark, and posted a .606 slugging percentage with 37 home runs and 122 RBI. On July 11, Williams went 8-for-8 in a doubleheader against the Houston Astros at Wrigley Field, raising his batting average at that time from .310 to .328. In August, he won his second and final NL Player of the Month Award (.438 average, 9 home runs, 29 RBI); on August 26, he broke Stan Hack&#x27;s team record of 2,193 hits by a left-handed hitter, tying his career high with five hits including a pair of home runs in a 10-inning, 10-9 win over the San Francisco Giants. For the second time, he was the MVP runner-up that year to Johnny Bench of the Cincinnati Reds. On June 15, 1973, in an 8-3 road loss to the Braves, he became the fourth player to appear in 2,000 games with the Cubs. On August 15, 1974, Williams became the third Cub to reach the 2,500 hit mark with an 8th-inning single in a 5-3 win over the Houston Astros.

===Oakland Athletics===

In 1974 the Cubs finished in last place, with their worst record since 1966; after two years of declining production, with the lowest home run and RBI totals of his career, Williams was traded in October to the American League&#x27;s Oakland Athletics for second baseman Manny Trillo and two pitchers. He helped lead Oakland to the 1975 AL West championship as a designated hitter, hitting 23 homers with 81 RBI, and on June 12 became the 16th player to hit 400 career home runs when he homered in a 9-7 road loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. In the postseason, the three-time defending World Series champions were swept in three games in the AL Championship Series by the Boston Red Sox, with Williams going hitless in 7 at bats. In 1976, Williams played in 120 games and hit only .211. He retired after playing his last major league game on October 2, picking up a single in his final plate appearance in a 14-inning, 9-8 win over the California Angels.

===Career statistics===
In 2,488 games over 18 seasons, Williams posted a .290 batting average with 2,711 hits in 9,350 at bats, 1,410 runs, 434 doubles, 88 triples, 426 home runs, 1,475 RBI, 90 stolen bases, 1,045 walks, a .361 on-base percentage and a .492 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a combined .976 fielding percentage, including games at all three outfield positions and first base.

==Later years==

Williams credited a grade-school teacher with encouraging him to always try to improve, citing the old saying, &quot;Good, better, best / Never let it rest / Until the good is better / And the better is best.&quot;

Williams was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987. Two weeks later on August 13, Williams&#x27; uniform number 26 was retired at Wrigley Field. His was the second number to be retired by the Cubs, the first being Ernie Banks&#x27; number 14. Following his departure from the Cubs, the number was reassigned to other players from time to time, most notably Larry Biittner; Williams reclaimed it during several intervals of coaching with the Cubs after his playing days had ended.

 In 1999, he was selected to the Cubs All-Century Team and was named as one of 100 finalists to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. During the 2010 season, the Cubs honored Williams with a statue outside Wrigley Field. The statue was unveiled in a pre-game ceremony before their home game on September 7 against the Astros.

In 2011, Williams was appointed as a member of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s 16-member Golden Era Committee (part of the Veterans Committee), which considers ten Golden Era candidates every three years for the Hall of Fame. The ten candidates from the 1947 to 1972 era are first identified by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) appointed Historical Overview Committee (10-12 BBWAA members) every three years. Former Cubs third baseman Ron Santo was the only candidate elected to the Hall of Fame by the committee (including 8 members of the Hall of Fame) during their winter meetings in December 2011 (and 2014).

<text>An environmental gradient, or climate gradient, is a change in abiotic (non-living) factors through space (or time). Environmental gradients can be related to factors such as altitude, depth, temperature, soil humidity and precipitation. Often times, a multitude of biotic (living) factors are closely related to these gradients; as a result of a change in an environmental gradient, factors such as species abundance, population density, morphology, primary productivity, predation, and local adaptation may be impacted.
== Abiotic influence ==
The species distribution along environmental gradients has been studied intensively due to large databases of species presence data (e.g. GBIF). The abiotic factors that environmental gradients consist of can have a direct ramifications on organismal survival. Generally, organismal distribution is tied to those abiotic factors, but even an environmental gradient of one abiotic factor yields insight into how a species distribution might look. For example, aspects of the landscape such as soil composition, temperature, and precipitation all factor in to an accurate idea of habitable territory a plant species might occupy; information on one of those factors can help form an environmental gradient by which a proximate species distribution may be generated. Similarly, along the upstream-downstream gradient of a river, fish assemblages (groupings) can vary in species and trait diversity; upstream habitats, which tend to be at higher elevations, have been observed to develop greater species and trait diversity. With elevated regions most intensely feeling the effects of climate change and these effects being linked to increased species diversity in impacted regions, this is a key consideration in prioritizing habitats for conservation efforts. At an ecotone, species abundances change relatively quickly compared to the environmental gradient.

== Biotic interactions ==
Although environmental gradients are comprised gradually changing and predictable patterns of an abiotic factor, there is strong interplay between both biotic-biotic factors as well as biotic-abiotic factors. For example, species abundance usually changes along environmental gradients in a more or less predictable way. However, the species abundance along an environmental gradient is not only determined by the abiotic factor associated with the gradient but, also by the change in the biotic interactions, like competition and predation, along the environmental gradient.

== Local adaptation along environmental gradients ==
Depending on the size of the landscape and the gene flow between populations, local adaptation could arise between populations inhabiting two extremes of the landscape. The opposing extremes in abiotic conditions that are faced between populations and the lack of homogenizing gene flow could present conditions where two populations are able to differentiate. Often times when comparing fitness or phenotypic values across an environmental gradient, the data are fixated into a reaction norm framework. In this way, an individual can directly assess the changes across a landscape of a particular species&#x27; phenotype or compare fitness and phenotypes of populations within a species across environmental gradients (particularly when performing reciprocal transplant studies).

== Impact of climate change ==
Current models predict that as climate change intensifies, certain environmental gradients may experience the effects as changing rates of natural processes or impacts on distribution and characteristics of species within them. Given the interconnectedness of abiotic factors, long-term disturbances of one gradient have the possibility of affecting other gradients.

===Soil characteristics===
Soil respiration, the process of soil naturally releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, acts as an example of this. In areas where soil moisture is not limiting (with moisture being a key part of the respiration process), soil respiration increases with rising temperatures; thus, respiration patterns form the gradient, and higher emissions are observed in warmer ecosystems. Similarly, rate of precipitation has a positive correlation with respiration (as moisture no longer becomes a limiting factor). Thus, it not only is its own gradient (average precipitation across a range), but also connects with the respiration gradient and impacts it.

===Altitude===
Altitude gradients are a key consideration in understanding migration patterns due to the effects of global warming. As temperatures increase, trees adapted to warmer climates will migrate uphill for access to sunlight, and thus populations of temperate or cold-adapted trees and the habitats suitable for them will shrink.

== Environmental gradients in society ==

Environmental gradients are not limited to naturally occurring variations in environmental factors across a range; they have also been created by human activity and industrialization. Air pollution is present as an environmental gradient in areas containing power plants, factories, and other pollutant-emitting facilities, as are environmental toxins, such as heavy metals, radiation, and pesticides; generally speaking, concentration decreases as distance from origin site increases. Differences in exposure to these elements across populations due to proximity to the origin site has become a major concern of environmental and public health activists, who cite health disparities linked to these gradients as an environmental justice concern.

<text>A rural district was a type of local government area – now superseded – established at the end of the 19th century in England, Wales, and Ireland for the administration of predominantly rural areas at a level lower than that of the administrative counties.

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales rural districts were created in 1894 by the Local Government Act 1894 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73) along with urban districts. They replaced the earlier system of sanitary districts (themselves based on poor law unions, but not replacing them).

Each rural district had an elected rural district council (RDC), which inherited the functions of the earlier sanitary districts, but also had wider authority over matters such as local planning, council housing, and playgrounds and cemeteries. Matters such as education and major roads were the responsibility of county councils.

Until 1930 the rural district councillors were also poor law guardians for the unions of which they formed part. Each parish was represented by one or more councillors.

Originally there were 787 rural districts in England and Wales, as they were based directly upon the sanitary districts and poor law unions which had preceded them. Gradual urbanisation over the following decades led to some rural districts being redefined as urban districts or merging with existing urban districts or boroughs. Other rural districts proved to be too small or poor to be viable, and under the Local Government Act 1929, 236 rural districts were abolished and merged or amalgamated into larger units. Further mergers took place over following decades and by 1965 the number of districts had been reduced to 473.

The typical shape of a rural district was a doughnut-shaped ring around a town (which would be either an urban district or a municipal borough). A good example of this is Melton and Belvoir Rural District, which surrounded the town of Melton Mowbray. Some rural districts were fragmented, consisting of a number of detached parts, such as Wigan Rural District. Some rural districts had a more rounded shape and had a small town or village as the administrative centre.

A few rural districts consisted of only one parish (for example, Tintwistle Rural District, Alston with Garrigill Rural District, South Mimms Rural District, King&#x27;s Lynn Rural District, Disley Rural District and Crowland Rural District). In such districts there was no separate parish council, and the rural district council exercised its functions.

All rural districts in England and Wales were abolished in 1974 (by the Local Government Act 1972) and were typically merged with nearby urban districts or boroughs to form &quot;districts&quot;, which included both urban and rural areas.

See Rural districts formed in England and Wales 1894–1974 for the districts created in 1894; List of rural and urban districts in England, and List of rural and urban districts in Wales for a list of rural districts at abolition in 1974.

==Ireland==

Rural districts were created in Ireland in 1899 under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. They were subdivided into district electoral divisions.

In 1921, Ireland was partitioned with Northern Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom, and the rest of the country leaving as the Irish Free State in 1922. In the Irish Free State, rural districts outside of County Dublin were abolished in 1925 under the Local Government Act 1925 amid widespread accusations of corruption. Their functions were transferred to the county councils The remaining rural districts in County Dublin were similarly abolished in 1930 by the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930. The former boundaries of the rural districts in the Republic of Ireland continue to be used for statistical purposes and defining constituencies.

In Northern Ireland, rural districts continued to exist until 1973 when they were abolished (along with all other local government of the old pattern) and replaced with a system of unitary districts.

== Newfoundland ==
Rural districts also existed in the Canadian province of Newfoundland to govern certain rural communities. Under Newfoundland&#x27;s &quot;Local Government Act&quot;, rural districts and towns together formed the province&#x27;s municipalities. Under the &quot;Municipalities Act&quot;, effective April 1, 1980, rural districts where abolished and automatically turned into towns.

<doc id="644156" wikidata="Q7127382" url="?curid=644156" title="Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group">
<text>The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG; ) was a human rights group led by Bassem Eid, a former fieldworker for B&#x27;Tselem.
It was active from 1996 to 2011 and largely focused on monitoring human rights violations by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).

According to B&#x27;Tselem, PHRMG &quot;monitors human rights violations by both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority.&quot; However, the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,&quot; edited by Cheryl Rubenberg, points out that despite the potential of PHRMG for that larger scope of reporting according to its official mandate, &quot;in practice, the group has dedicated most of its work to monitoring human rights violations committed by the PNA.&quot; In April 2006, the group published its final regular bulletin on human rights, and it closed it doors officially in 2011 due to lack of funding.

PHRMG was founded by Eid when he quit B&#x27;Tselem over the organization&#x27;s decision, as an Israeli NGO, to focus on Israeli human rights violations rather than those committed by Palestinian groups. In 1997, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described PHRMG as &quot;defying a taboo&quot; among human rights organizations against criticizing violations of human rights by Palestinian governing authorities.

<text>Charles Ernest Beulé (29 June 1826 – 4 April 1874) was a French archaeologist and politician.

==Biography==
Born in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, he was educated at the École Normale, and after holding the professorship of rhetoric at Moulins for a year, was sent to Athens in 1851 as one of the professors in the École Française.

While in Athens, he discovered the Beulé Gate leading to the &quot;propylaea&quot; of the acropolis, and his work, &quot;L&#x27;Acropole d&#x27;Athènes&quot;, was published by order of the minister of public instruction. On his return to France, promotion and distinctions followed rapidly upon his first successes. He was made a doctor of letters, &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, professor of archaeology at the Bibliothèque Impériale, member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and perpetual secretary of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.

He took great interest in political affairs, with which the last few years of his life were entirely occupied. Elected a member of the National Assembly in 1871, he zealously supported the Orleanist party. Between May and November 1873, he was Minister of the Interior in the Broglie ministry.

He committed suicide on 4 April 1874, aged 47.

==Works==
His other important works are: &#x27; (2nd edition 1875); &#x27; (published in 1858); &#x27; (published in 1860); and &#x27; (published in 1861).

Beulé was also the author of high-class popular works on artistic and historical subjects: &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;art grec avant Pericles&quot;, the second edition of which was published in 1870, and &quot;&quot; published in four parts between 1867 and 1870.

<text>Three Pagodas Pass (Phlone ; , &quot;Paya Thon Zu Taung Za Lang&quot;, ; , , ) is a pass in the Tenasserim Hills on the border between Thailand and Myanmar (Burma), at an elevation of . The pass links the town of Sangkhla Buri in the north of Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, to the town of Payathonsu in the south of Kayin State, Myanmar. 

==Etymology ==
The pass is named after three small, crumbling stupas or &quot;chedis&quot; which were probably built at the end of Ayutthaya period as a symbol of peace. The pagodas are now on the Thai side of the border in the village of Phra Chedi Sam Ong. Parts of the border are still disputed. These three chedis appear in the provincial seal of Kanchanaburi Province in stylized form. The pass gives its name to the Three Pagodas Fault.

== History ==
The pass has been the main land route into western Thailand since ancient times. It is one of the few passes in the Tenasserim Hills. 

The pass is named after three pagodas erected in 1929 by Phra Sri Suwan Khiri, the ruler of Sangkhla Buri, with the assistance of local villagers, and has reputedly served as a route for Indian monks in the 3rd century to disseminate Buddhism in Thailand.

During the Ayutthaya period in Thai history (14th–18th centuries), the pass was the main invasion route for the Burmese, but at times was also used against them by Siamese armies. The first Burmese invasion through the pass occurred in 1548 during the Burmese–Siamese War (1547–1549).

During World War II, Japan built the infamous Death Railway (officially Taimen – Rensetsu Tetsudo) through the pass. There is a memorial to commemorate the thousands of British, Australian, Dutch and American prisoners of war, and Asian forced labourers who died during the construction of the railway.

The region is home to several hill tribes, including Karens and Mons, who are unable or unwilling to obtain citizenship from either country. Separatist armies have repeatedly tried to seize the pass from Myanmar, with the Mons in effective control until 1990, when Burmese troops regained it. There is still occasional fighting in the area.

==Tourism==
Three Pagodas Pass is popular with tourists, who are allowed to obtain a one-day visa from the Thai side to visit Payathonsu. Attractions on the Burmese side include wooden furniture, jade carvings, and textiles. Thai tourists are allowed in as of 2011, while other tourists are not, due to its status as a temporary border checkpoint which only allows day trips between the two neighbouring countries.

==Festivals==
With the rambling strutting roosters of the Buddhist temple of Wat Suwankhiri on a Payathonsu cliff near by, during April, Three Pagodas Pass becomes a site of the Songkran Festival with cockfights, Burmese kickboxing and various folk dancing.

<doc id="644162" wikidata="Q992318" url="?curid=644162" title="Autumn Harvest Uprising">
<text>The Autumn Harvest Uprising was an insurrection that took place in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces of China, on September 7, 1927, led by Mao Zedong, who established a short-lived Hunan Soviet.

After initial success, the uprising was brutally put down by Kuomintang forces. Mao continued to believe in the rural strategy but concluded that it would be necessary to form a party army.

==Background==
In support of the Northern Expedition, Mao was sent to survey peasant conditions in his home province of Hunan. His Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan urged support for rural revolution.

==The uprising==
Initially, Mao struggled to garner forces for an uprising, but Li Zhen rallied the peasantry and members of her local communist troop to join. Mao then led a small peasant army against the Kuomintang and the landlords of Hunan, successfully establishing a Soviet government. The uprising was eventually defeated by Kuomintang forces within two months after the Soviet was established. Mao and the others were forced to retreat to the Jinggang Mountains on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, where he encountered an army of miners which would help him in later battles. This was one of the early armed uprisings by the Communists, and it marked a significant change in their strategy. Mao and Red Army founder Zhu De went on to develop a rural-based strategy that centered on guerrilla tactics. This paved the way for the Long March of 1934.

== Reasons for the uprising&#x27;s failure ==
The uprising shows the overwhelming importance of an organized military force to the success or failure of an insurrection, the failure reveals that the role and question of military force was given different emphasis by operatives of different levels in the communist party and came to be a topic of serious contention and disagreement which led to the disorganization. An obvious lack of appreciation for rudimentary pre-insurrectionary military organization hints that Mao was more &quot;putschist&quot; (to a point) than his Chinese or Russian superiors.

===Mass killings against Hunanese civilians===
Nationalist anti-communist mass killings were directed against all Hunanese civilians. About 80,000 Hunanese were killed in Hunan&#x27;s Liling and about 300,000 Hunanese were killed in Hunan&#x27;s Chaling County, Leiyang, Liuyang and Pingjiang.

<text>The SOCRATES programme was an educational initiative of the European Commission; 31 countries took part. The initial Socrates programme ran from 1994 until 31 December 1999 when it was replaced by the Socrates II programme on 24 January 2000, which ran until 2006. This, in turn, was replaced by the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013.

The countries participating in the programme were the then 25 European Union countries, the then candidate countries Romania and Bulgaria; Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey.

The programme is named after the Greek philosopher Socrates.

==Declared aims==
*&quot;To strengthen the European dimension of education at all levels&quot;
*&quot;To improve knowledge of European languages&quot;
*&quot;To promote co-operation and mobility throughout education&quot;
*&quot;To encourage innovation in education&quot;
*&quot;To promote equal opportunities in all sectors of education&quot;

==Building blocks==
* The Comenius programme – relating to primary and secondary.
* The Erasmus programme – relating to higher.
* The Grundtvig programme – relating to adult education.
* The Lingua programme – relating to education in European languages.
* The Minerva programme – relating to information and communication technology in education.

==European Union-funded language projects==
Within the Socrates programme, funded by the European Union Directorates-General: Education and Culture (DG EAC), Information Society and Media (DG INFSO) and the EuropeAid Cooperation Office (DG AIDCO), the promotion and learning of languages is a high priority. Below is a short list of some funded projects:

# ARGuing for Multilingual Motivation in Web 2.0. – ARGuing is a project that addresses two needs by utilizing an Alternate Reality Game; firstly, how to bridge the technological gap between educators and their students and secondly, how to motivate students to understand the benefits of learning languages at a level that impacts on their existing personal lives.
# Autonomous Language Learning The Autonomous Language Learning (ALL) project, is building Blended Learning language courses in four European languages (Turkish, Romanian, Bulgarian and Lithuanian).
# Chain Stories project Young students, in their first year of language learning, can complete creative writing in their mother tongue. They then pass on their story to other schools (in other countries/languages), within a chain, for completion.
# Euromobil is an interactive multimedia language learning and information programme for nine European target languages. The EUROMOBIL project was launched in 1999 with the aim to support student mobility.
# Tool Project Tool for Online and Offline Language Learning (TOOL) project is building Blended Learning language courses in five European languages (Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, Maltese, Slovene).
# Don&#x27;t Give Up Motivating adult language learners to complete language courses.
# Lullabies of Europe Collecting the lullabies of Europe to use as a very early learning language resource.

<doc id="644175" wikidata="Q1687830" url="?curid=644175" title="Jerry Greenfield">
<text>Jerry Greenfield (born March 14, 1951) is an American businessman, philanthropist, and activist. He is a co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Homemade Holdings, Inc.

Greenfield grew up on Long Island. He attended Oberlin College, where he was a National Merit Scholar and followed a pre-med curriculum before graduating in 1973. He applied unsuccessfully for medical school before deciding to go into business with Ben Cohen, a childhood friend.
After taking a course in ice-cream making from Penn State, Greenfield and Cohen opened their first ice cream store in downtown Burlington, Vermont. The company, which sold to the British-Dutch corporation Unilever in 2000 has since opened almost 200 franchised shops and reports earnings of $237 million annually.

==Early life==
Jerry Greenfield grew up on Long Island, to a family of Jewish roots. He attended Merrick Avenue Junior High School, where he met Ben Cohen in 1963. Greenfield and Cohen both attended Calhoun High School and remained friends until they both graduated and left Long Island to attend college.

Greenfield chose to pursue a pre-med curriculum at Oberlin College, where he began working as an ice cream scooper in the school&#x27;s cafeteria.

After graduating in 1973, Greenfield failed to get into medical school. At this point, Greenfield decided to move back to New York where he shared an apartment with Cohen and worked as a lab technician. In 1974, Greenfield was again rejected from medical school and decided to move to North Carolina with his future wife, Elizabeth Skarie, and continued to work as a lab technician.

Greenfield lived with Cohen in Saratoga Springs, New York during the summer of 1977. After initially considering opening a bagel shop, they chose to open an ice cream store. They took a five-dollar correspondence course in ice-cream making and opened their first store in a former gas station in Burlington, Vermont. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s opened in the summer of 1978.

During the 1980s, Greenfield left the business to support Elizabeth in Arizona as she pursued a Ph.D. in psychology. The couple returned to Vermont in 1985, when Greenfield assumed the position of Director of Mobile Promotions.

==Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s==

Greenfield and Cohen began looking for a proper location for their ice cream parlor in 1977. The criteria that they set down were that the location should be a college town, since they assumed college students ate a lot of ice cream, and that it should be warm. After comparing information from almanacs and a guide to American colleges, the pair realized that every warm college town already had an ice cream shop and settled on Burlington, Vermont in 1978, as the location for their shop.
After choosing their town, the two businessmen needed to find a suitable building. They decided on an old gas station and began looking for financing. With a combined savings totaling around $8,000, Greenfield and Cohen began searching for a bank to lend them money. Repeatedly they found themselves rejected because the gas station could only be leased for one year at a time and it was judged unwise to invest large amounts of capital in such a venture. Finally they managed to receive a $4,000 loan and began renovating the station. On May 5, 1978, the parlor opened and throughout the summer experienced success, however, the pair struggled throughout the winter.

In 1980, after experiencing initial success in their attempts to distribute their ice cream to restaurants throughout Vermont, the company moved to a larger facility and began packaging ice cream in pint size containers. In 1984, Häagen-Dazs tried to limit distribution of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s in Boston, prompting Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s to file suit against Häagen-Dazs&#x27; parent company, Pillsbury, in its now famous &quot;What&#x27;s the Doughboy Afraid Of?&quot; campaign. In 1987 Häagen-Dazs again tried to enforce exclusive distribution, and Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s filed its second lawsuit against the Pillsbury Company.

In April 2000, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s was bought by the multinational food giant, Unilever. Since the purchase, Greenfield and Cohen have continued to be involved at the company but Jerry said in an interview they had &quot;no responsibility, no authority, and very little influence.&quot;

==Political activism==
On April 18, 2016, Greenfield and Cohen were arrested at a Democracy Awakening protest in Washington, D.C.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Greenfield married Elizabeth Skarie and in 1988, they had a son Tyrone. He resides in Williston, Vermont, a small town just outside Burlington.

<doc id="644180" wikidata="Q16824308" url="?curid=644180" title="Advanced Extension Award">
<text>The Advanced Extension Awards are a type of school-leaving qualification in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, usually taken in the final year of schooling (age 17/18), and designed to allow students to &quot;demonstrate their knowledge, understanding and skills to the full&quot;. Currently, it is only available for Mathematics and offered by the exam board Edexcel.

They were introduced in 2002, in response to the UK Government&#x27;s &quot;Excellence in Cities&quot; report, as a successor to the S-level examination, and aimed at the top 10% of students in A level tests. They are assessed entirely by external examinations. 

Due to introduction of the A* grade for A level courses starting September 2008 (first certification 2010), they have since been phased out, with the exception of the Advanced Extension Award in Mathematics which continues to be available to students.

== Results ==
According to EducationGuardian.co.uk, in 2004, 50.4% of the 7246 entrants failed to achieve a grade at all (fail), indicating that the awards are fulfilling their role in separating the elite. Only 18.3% of students attained the top of the two grades available, the Distinction, with the next 31.3% of students receiving the grade of Merit. Given that only the top students in the country sat these examinations, these results indicate that the AEAs were successful in rewarding only the 50-100 students that were most able in a particular subject.

It was possible to obtain an AEA distinction in more than one subject; however, given the rarity of AEA distinctions, this was uncommon.

== Available subjects ==
Due to the small numbers of candidates for each subject, the exam boards divided the subjects offered amongst themselves, so that – unlike A-levels – each AEA was only offered by one board.
* Biology (including Human Biology) (AQA)
* Business (OCR)
* Chemistry (AQA)
* Critical Thinking (OCR)
* Economics (AQA)
* English (OCR)
* French (OCR)
* Geography (WJEC)
* German (CCEA)
* History (Edexcel)
* Irish (CCEA)
* Latin (OCR)
* Mathematics (Edexcel)
* Physics (CCEA)
* Psychology (AQA)
* Religious Studies (Edexcel)
* Spanish (Edexcel)
* Welsh (WJEC)
* Welsh as a second language (WJEC)

== Partial withdrawal ==

The last AEA examinations across the full range of subjects took place in June 2009, with results issued in August 2009. The Advanced Extension Award was then withdrawn for all subjects except mathematics. This came after the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) decided that the new A* grade being offered at A level would overlap with the purpose of the AEA, rendering them unnecessary. However, the AEA in mathematics was extended until June 2012, as confirmed by Edexcel and the QCA. This was because it met a &quot;definite need&quot;, since the A* grade was still not viewed as being challenging enough. In June 2011 Edexcel announced that the AEA was being extended further for mathematics, until June 2015, which was later extended until 2018. 

In 2018, Edexcel introduced a new specification, meaning the Advanced Extension Award in mathematics would continue to be available to students in 2019 and beyond, as a qualification aimed at the top 10% of students at A level. All other subjects remain withdrawn, though opportunity exists for examination boards to offer AEAs in other subjects should they choose to in the future, subject to certain expectations. 

== Effect of 2020 pandemic ==
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in summer 2020 AEA (mathematics) grades were awarded according to assessments made by teachers.

Prospal was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, third round, 71st overall. While with the Flyers, Prospal suffered a fractured arm during the 1997 playoffs. Prospal and another player collided during the Flyers&#x27; practice session. During the 1997–98 season, Prospal, who was named to the 1998 Czech Olympic hockey team, broke his leg while fighting for the puck with Lance Pitlick during a game with the Ottawa Senators; Prospal was unable to play in the 1998 Winter Olympics. Prospal was traded to the Senators a few months later. During the 2004–05 lockout, Prospal played for his hometown team HC České Budějovice, leading them in scoring and helping the team return to the Czech Extraliga.

<doc id="644184" wikidata="Q1811448" url="?curid=644184" title="Trans-Olza">
<text>Trans-Olza (, ; , &quot;Záolší&quot;; ), also known as Trans-Olza Silesia (), is a territory in the Czech Republic which was disputed between Poland and Czechoslovakia during the Interwar Period. Its name comes from the Olza River.

The history of the Trans-Olza region began in 1918 when, after the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the newly-established Czechoslovakia claimed the area, which was mainly inhabited by Poles. Poland maintained control over the region and began to hold elections, to which Czechoslovakia responded by invading and annexing the territory in January 1919.

The area as it is known today was created in 1920, when Cieszyn Silesia was divided between the two countries during the Spa Conference. Trans-Olza forms the eastern part of the Czech portion of Cieszyn Silesia. The division again did not satisfy any side, and persisting conflict over the region led to its annexation by Poland in October 1938, following the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. After the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, the area became a part of Nazi Germany until 1945. After the war, the 1920 borders were restored.

Historically, the largest specified ethnic group inhabiting this area were Poles. Under Austrian rule, Cieszyn Silesia was initially divided into three (Bielitz, Friedek and Teschen), and later into four districts (plus Freistadt). One of them, Frýdek, had a mostly Czech population, the other three were mostly inhabited by Poles. During the 19th century the number of ethnic Germans grew. After declining at the end of the 19th century, at the beginning of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938 the Czech population grew significantly to rival the Poles. Another significant ethnic group were the Jews, but almost the entire Jewish population was murdered during World War II by Nazi Germany.

In addition to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations there was another group of Silesians, who claimed to be of a distinct national identity. This group enjoyed popular support throughout Cieszyn Silesia, though its strongest supporters were among the Protestants in the eastern part of Cieszyn Silesia (now part of Poland), not in Trans-Olza itself.

==Name and territory==
The Polish term &quot;Zaolzie&quot; (meaning &quot;lands beyond the Olza&quot;) is used predominantly in Poland and by the Polish minority living in the territory. It is also often used by foreign scholars, e.g. American ethnolinguist Kevin Hannan. The term &quot;Zaolzie&quot; was first used in 1930s by Polish writer Paweł Hulka-Laskowski. In Czech it is mainly referred to as &quot;České Těšínsko&quot;/&quot;Českotěšínsko&quot; (&quot;land around Český Těšín&quot;), or as &quot;Těšínsko&quot; or &quot;Těšínské Slezsko&quot; (meaning Cieszyn Silesia). The Czech equivalent of Zaolzie (&quot;Zaolší&quot; or &quot;Zaolží&quot;) is rarely used.
The term Zaolzie denotes the territory of the former districts of Český Těšín and Fryštát, in which the Polish population formed a majority according to the 1910 Austrian census. It makes up the eastern part of the Czech portion of Cieszyn Silesia. However, Polish historian Józef Szymeczek notes that the term is often mistakenly used for the whole Czech part of Cieszyn Silesia.

Since the 1960 reform of administrative divisions of Czechoslovakia, Trans-Olza has consisted of Karviná District and the eastern part of Frýdek-Místek District.

==History==
After the Migration Period the area was settled by West Slavs, which were later organized into the Golensizi tribe. The tribe had a large and important gord situated in contemporary Chotěbuz. In the 880s or the early 890s the gord was raided and burned, most probably by an army of Svatopluk I of Moravia, and afterwards the area could have been subjugated by Great Moravia, which is however questioned by historians like Zdeněk Klanica, Idzi Panic, Stanisław Szczur.
After the fall of Great Moravia in 907 the area could have been under the influence of Bohemian rulers. In the late 10th century Poland, ruled by Bolesław I Chrobry, began to contend for the region, which was crossed by important international routes. From 950 to 1060 it was under the rule of Bohemia, and from 1060 it was part of the Piast Kingdom of Poland. The written history explicitly about the region begins on 23 April 1155 when Cieszyn/Těšín was first mentioned in a written document, a letter from Pope Adrian IV issued for Walter, Bishop of Wrocław, where it was listed amongst other centres of castellanies. The castellany was then a part of Duchy of Silesia. In 1172 it became a part of Duchy of Racibórz, and from 1202 of Duchy of Opole and Racibórz. In the first half of the 13th century the Moravian settlement organised by Arnold von Hückeswagen from Starý Jičín castle and later accelerated by Bruno von Schauenburg, Bishop of Olomouc, began to press close to Silesian settlements. This prompted signing of a special treaty between Duke Vladislaus I of Opole and King Ottokar II of Bohemia on December 1261 which regulated a local border between their states along the Ostravice River. In order to strengthen the border Władysław of Opole decided to found Orlová monastery in 1268. In the continued process of feudal fragmentation of Poland the Castellany of Cieszyn was eventually transformed in 1290 into the Duchy of Cieszyn, which in 1327 became an autonomic fiefdom of the Bohemian crown. Upon the death of Elizabeth Lucretia, its last ruler from the Polish Piast dynasty in 1653, it passed directly to the Czech kings from the Habsburg dynasty. When most of Silesia was conquered by Prussian king Frederick the Great in 1742, the Cieszyn region was part of the small southern portion that was retained by the Habsburg Monarchy (Austrian Silesia).
Up to the mid-19th century members of the local Slav population did not identify themselves as members of larger ethnolinguistic entities. In Cieszyn Silesia (as in all West Slavic borderlands) various territorial identities pre-dated ethnic and national identity. Consciousness of membership within a greater Polish or Czech nation spread slowly in Silesia.

From 1848 to the end of the 19th century, local Polish and Czech people co-operated, united against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire and later of Austria-Hungary. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions arose as the area&#x27;s economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia. About 60,000 people arrived between 1880 and 1910. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate. They worked in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled. Almost all of them assimilated into the Czech population. Many of them settled in Ostrava (west of the ethnic border), as heavy industry was spread through the whole western part of Cieszyn Silesia. Even today, ethnographers find that about 25,000 people in Ostrava (about 8% of the population) have Polish surnames.
The Czech population (living mainly in the northern part of the area: Bohumín, Orlová, etc.) declined numerically at the end of the 19th century, assimilating with the prevalent Polish population. This process shifted with the industrial boom in the area.
=== Decision time (1918–1920) ===

Cieszyn Silesia was claimed by both Poland and Czechoslovakia: the Polish &quot;Rada Narodowa Księstwa Cieszyńskiego&quot; made its claim in its declaration &quot;Ludu śląski!&quot; of 30 October 1918, and the Czech &quot;Zemský národní výbor pro Slezsko&quot; did so in its declaration of 1 November 1918. On 31 October 1918, at the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the majority of the area was taken over by local Polish authorities supported by armed forces. An interim agreement from 2 November 1918 reflected the inability of the two national councils to come to final delimitation and on 5 November 1918, the area was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia by an agreement of the two councils. In early 1919 both councils were absorbed by the newly created and independent central governments in Prague and Warsaw.

Following an announcement that elections to the Sejm (parliament) of Poland would be held in the entirety of Cieszyn Silesia, the Czechoslovak government requested that the Poles cease their preparations as no elections were to be held in the disputed territory until a final agreement could be reached. When their demands were rejected by the Poles, the Czechs decided to resolve the issue by force and on 23 January 1919 invaded the area.

The Czechoslovak offensive was halted after pressure from the Entente following the Battle of Skoczów, and a ceasefire was signed on 3 February. The new Czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on historic and ethnic grounds, but especially on economic grounds. The area was important for the Czechs as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed the area (the Košice–Bohumín Railway, which was one of only two railroads that linked the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time). The area is also very rich in black coal. Many important coal mines, facilities and metallurgy factories are located there. The Polish side based its claim to the area on ethnic criteria: a majority (69.2%) of the area&#x27;s population was Polish according to the last (1910) Austrian census.

In this very tense atmosphere it was decided that a plebiscite would be held in the area asking people which country this territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920, and after analysing the situation declared a state of emergency in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the area remained very tense, with mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings. A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually, on 28 July 1920, by a decision of the Spa Conference, Czechoslovakia received 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, containing 67.9% of the population. It was this territory that became known from the Polish standpoint as &quot;Zaolzie&quot; – the Olza River marked the boundary between the Polish and Czechoslovak parts of the territory.

The most vocal support for union with Poland had come from within the territory awarded to Czechoslovakia, while some of the strongest opponents of Polish rule came from the territory awarded to Poland.

==== View of Richard M. Watt ====

Historian Richard M. Watt writes, &quot;On 5 November 1918, the Poles and the Czechs in the region disarmed the Austrian garrison (...) The Poles took over the areas that appeared to be theirs, just as the Czechs had assumed administration of theirs. Nobody objected to this friendly arrangement (...) Then came second thoughts in Prague. It was observed that under the agreement of 5 November, the Poles controlled about a third of the duchy&#x27;s coal mines. The Czechs realized that they had given away rather a lot (...) It was recognized that any takeover in Cieszyn would have to be accomplished in a manner acceptable by the victorious Allies (...), so the Czechs cooked up a tale that the Cieszyn area was becoming Bolshevik (...) The Czechs put together a substantial body of infantry – about 15,000 men – and on 23 January 1919, they invaded the Polish-held areas. To confuse the Poles, the Czechs recruited some Allied officers of Czech background and put these men in their respective wartime uniforms at the head of the invasion forces. After a little skirmishing, the tiny Polish defense force was nearly driven out.&quot;

In 1919, the matter went to consideration in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their need on the Cieszyn coal, useful in order to influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles were to get most of the people and the strategic rail line. Watt writes: &quot;Czech envoy Edvard Beneš proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Beneš was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Beneš knew what he was doing. A plebiscite would take some time to set up, and a lot could happen in that time – particularly when a nation&#x27;s affairs were conducted as cleverly as were Czechoslovakia&#x27;s.&quot;
Watt argues that Beneš strategically waited for Poland&#x27;s moment of weakness, and moved in during the Polish-Soviet War crisis in July 1920. As Watt writes, &quot;Over the dinner table, Beneš convinced the British and French that the plebiscite should not be held and that the Allies should simply impose their own decision in the Cieszyn matter. More than that, Beneš persuaded the French and the British to draw a frontier line that gave Czechoslovakia most of the territory of Cieszyn, the vital railroad and all the important coal fields. With this frontier, 139,000 Poles were to be left in Czech territory, whereas only 2,000 Czechs were left on the Polish side&quot;.

&quot;The next morning Beneš visited the Polish delegation at Spa. By giving the impression that the Czechs would accept a settlement favorable to the Poles without a plebiscite, Beneš got the Poles to sign an agreement that Poland would abide by any Allied decision regarding Cieszyn. The Poles, of course, had no way of knowing that Beneš had already persuaded the Allies to make a decision on Cieszyn. After a brief interval, to make it appear that due deliberation had taken place, the Allied Council of Ambassadors in Paris imposed its &#x27;decision&#x27;. Only then did it dawn on the Poles that at Spa they had signed a blank check. To them, Beneš&#x27; stunning triumph was not diplomacy, it was a swindle (...) As Polish Prime Minister Wincenty Witos warned: &#x27;The Polish nation has received a blow which will play an important role in our relations with the Czechoslovak Republic. The decision of the Council of Ambassadors has given the Czechs a piece of Polish land containing a population which is mostly Polish... The decision has caused a rift between these two nations which are ordinarily politically and economically united&#x27; (

==== View of Victor S. Mamatey ====
Another account of the situation in 1918–1919 is given by Slovak-American historian Victor S. Mamatey. He notes that when the French government recognised Czechoslovakia&#x27;s right to the &quot;boundaries of Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia&quot; in its note to Austria of 19 December, the Czechoslovak government acted under the impression it had French support for its claim to Cieszyn Silesia as part of Austrian Silesia. However, Paris believed it gave that assurance only against German-Austrian claims, not Polish ones. Paris, however, viewed both Czechoslovakia and Poland as potential allies against Germany and did not want to cool relations with either. Mamatey writes that the Poles &quot;brought the matter before the peace conference that had opened in Paris on 18 January. On 29 January, the Council of Ten summoned Beneš and the Polish delegate Roman Dmowski to explain the dispute, and on 1 February obliged them to sign an agreement redividing the area pending its final disposition by the peace conference. Czechoslovakia thus failed to gain her objective in Cieszyn.&quot;

With respect to the arbitration decision itself, Mamatey writes that &quot;On 25 March, to expedite the work of the peace conference, the Council of Ten was divided into the Council of Four (The &quot;Big Four&quot;) and the Council of Five (the foreign ministers). Early in April the two councils considered and approved the recommendations of the Czechoslovak commission without a change – with the exception of Cieszyn, which they referred to Poland and Czechoslovakia to settle in bilateral negotiations.&quot; When the Polish-Czechoslovak negotiations failed, the Allied powers proposed plebiscites in the Cieszyn Silesia and also in the border districts of Orava and Spiš (now in Slovakia) to which the Poles had raised claims. In the end, however, no plebiscites were held due to the rising mutual hostilities of Czechs and Poles in Cieszyn Silesia. Instead, on 28 July 1920 the Spa Conference (also known as the Conference of Ambassadors) divided each of the three disputed areas between Poland and Czechoslovakia.

=== Part of Czechoslovakia (1920–1938) ===

The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division of Cieszyn Silesia. About 12,000 to 14,000 Poles were forced to leave to Poland. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Trans-Olza in Czechoslovakia. Estimates (depending mainly whether the Silesians are included as Poles or not) range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles filled in Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities but reality in Trans-Olza was quite different. Local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. Czech schools were built in ethnically almost entirely Polish municipalities. This and other factors contributed to the cultural assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After a few years, the heightened nationalism typical for the years around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not follow certain laws related to language, legislative and organizational issues. Polish deputies in the Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put those issues on agenda. One way or another, more and more local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.

=== Part of Poland (1938–1939) ===


Within the region originally demanded from Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in 1938 was the important railway junction city of Bohumín (). The Poles regarded the city as of crucial importance to the area and to Polish interests. On 28 September, Edvard Beneš composed a note to the Polish administration offering to reopen the debate surrounding the territorial demarcation in Těšínsko in the interest of mutual relations, but he delayed in sending it in hopes of good news from London and Paris, which came only in a limited form. Beneš then turned to the Soviet leadership in Moscow, which had begun a partial mobilisation in eastern Belarus and the Ukrainian SSR on 22 September and threatened Poland with the dissolution of the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact. The Czech government was offered 700 fighter planes if room for them could be found on the Czech airfields. On 28 September, all the military districts west of the Urals were ordered to stop releasing men for leave. On 29 September 330,000 reservists were up throughout the western USSR.

Nevertheless, the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Józef Beck, believed that Warsaw should act rapidly to forestall the German occupation of the city. At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time until noon the following day. At 11:45 a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague and told him that Poland could have what it wanted. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5 km2 with a population of 227,399 people. Administratively the annexed area was divided between two counties: Frysztat and Cieszyn County. At the same time Slovakia lost to Hungary 10,390 km2 with 854,277 inhabitants.

The Germans were delighted with this outcome, and were happy to give up the sacrifice of a small provincial rail centre to Poland in exchange for the ensuing propaganda benefits. It spread the blame of the partition of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, made Poland a participant in the process and confused political expectations. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Nazi Germany – a charge that Warsaw was hard-put to deny.

The Polish side argued that Poles in Trans-Olza deserved the same ethnic rights and freedom as the Sudeten Germans under the Munich Agreement. The vast local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change, seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice, but they quickly changed their mood. The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various key positions from which locals were fired. The Polish language became the sole official language. Using Czech (or German) by Czechs (or Germans) in public was prohibited and Czechs and Germans were being forced to leave the annexed area or become subject to Polonization. Rapid Polonization policies then followed in all parts of public and private life. Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. The Roman Catholic parishes in the area belonged either to the Archdiocese of Breslau (Archbishop Bertram) or to the Archdiocese of Olomouc (Archbishop Leopold Prečan), respectively, both traditionally comprising cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakia and Germany. When the Polish government demanded after its takeover that the parishes there be disentangled from these two archdioceses, the Holy See complied. Pope Pius XI, former nuncio to Poland, subjected the Catholic parishes in Trans-Olza to an apostolic administration under Stanisław Adamski, Bishop of Katowice.

Czechoslovak education in the Czech and German language ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechoslovaks emigrated to core Czechoslovakia (the later Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature to that of the Czechoslovak ones before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new Polish national authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often fired from work. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Trans-Olza. The local Poles continued to feel like second-class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only 11 months until the invasion of Poland started on 1 September 1939.

==== Reception ====
When Poland entered the Western camp in April 1939, General Gamelin reminded General Kasprzycki of the Polish role in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. According to historian Paul N. Hehn, Poland&#x27;s annexation of Zaolzie may have contributed to the British and French reluctance to attack the Germans with greater forces in September 1939.

Richard M. Watt describes the Polish capture of Zaolzie in these words:

Amid the general euphoria in Poland – the acquisition of Zaolzie was a very popular development – no one paid attention to the bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the incoming Poles. He predicted that it would not be long before the Poles would themselves be handing Zaolzie over to the Germans.

Watt also writes that

the Polish 1938 ultimatum to Czechoslovakia and its acquisition of Zaolzie were gross tactical errors. Whatever justice there might have been to the Polish claim upon Zaolzie, its seizure in 1938 was an enormous mistake in terms of the damage done to Poland&#x27;s reputation among the democratic powers of the world.

Daladier, the French Prime Minister, told the US ambassador to France that &quot;he hoped to live long enough to pay Poland for her cormorant attitude in the present crisis by proposing a new partition.&quot; The Soviet Union was so hostile to Poland over Munich that there was a real prospect that war between the two states might break out quite separate from the wider conflict over Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Prime Minister, Molotov, denounced the Poles as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s jackals&quot;.

In his postwar memoirs, Winston Churchill compared Germany and Poland to vultures landing on the dying carcass of Czechoslovakia and lamented that &quot;over a question so minor as Cieszyn, they [the Poles] sundered themselves from all those friends in France, Britain and the United States who had lifted them once again to a national, coherent life, and whom they were soon to need so sorely. ... It is a mystery and tragedy of European history that a people capable of every heroic virtue ... as individuals, should repeatedly show such inveterate faults in almost every aspect of their governmental life.&quot; Churchill also associated such behaviour with hyenas.

In 2009 Polish president Lech Kaczyński declared during 70th anniversary of start of World War II, which was welcomed by the Czech and Slovak diplomatic delegations:

The Polish annexation of Zaolzie is frequently brought up by Russian media as a counter-argument to Soviet-Nazi cooperation.

=== World War II ===

On 1 September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe, and subsequently made Trans-Olza part of the &quot;Military district of Upper Silesia&quot;. On 26 October 1939 Nazi Germany unilaterally annexed Trans-Olza as part of Landkreis Teschen. During the war, strong Germanization was introduced by the authorities. The Jews were in the worst position, followed by the Poles. Poles received lower food rations, they were supposed to pay extra taxes, they were not allowed to enter theatres, cinemas, etc. Polish and Czech education ceased to exist, Polish organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. Katowice&#x27;s Bishop Adamski was deposed as apostolic administrator for the Catholic parishes in Trans-Olza and on 23 December 1939 Cesare Orsenigo, nuncio to Germany, returned them to their original archdioceses of Breslau or Olomouc, respectively, with effect of 1 January 1940.

The German authorities introduced terror into Trans-Olza. The Nazis especially targeted the Polish intelligentsia, many of whom died during the war. Mass killings, executions, arrests, taking locals to forced labour and deportations to concentration camps all happened on a daily basis. The most notorious war crime was a murder of 36 villagers in and around Żywocice on 6 August 1944. This massacre is known as the Żywocice tragedy (). The resistance movement, mostly composed of Poles, was fairly strong in Trans-Olza. So-called &quot;Volksliste&quot; – a document in which a non-German citizen declared that he had some German ancestry by signing it; refusal to sign this document could lead to deportation to a concentration camp – were introduced. Local people who took them were later on enrolled in the Wehrmacht. Many local people with no German ancestry were also forced to take them. The World War II death toll in Trans-Olza is estimated at about 6,000 people: about 2,500 Jews, 2,000 other citizens (80% of them being Poles) and more than 1,000 locals who died in the Wehrmacht (those who took the Volksliste). Also a few hundred Poles from Trans-Olza were murdered by Soviets in the Katyn massacre.
Percentage-wise, Trans-Olza suffered the worst human loss from the whole of Czechoslovakia – about 2.6% of the total population.

=== Since 1945 ===
Immediately after World War II, Trans-Olza was returned to Czechoslovakia within its 1920 borders, although local Poles had hoped it would again be given to Poland. Most Czechoslovaks of German ethnicity were expelled, and the local Polish population again suffered discrimination, as many Czechs blamed them for the discrimination by the Polish authorities in 1938–1939. Polish organizations were banned, and the Czechoslovak authorities carried out many arrests and dismissed many Poles from work. The situation had somewhat improved when the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took power in February 1948. Polish property deprived by the German occupants during the war was never returned.

As to the Catholic parishes in Trans-Olza pertaining to the Archdiocese of Breslau Archbishop Bertram, then residing in the episcopal Jánský vrch castle in Czechoslovak Javorník, appointed František Onderek (1888–1962) as &quot;vicar general for the Czechoslovak portion of the Archdiocese of Breslau&quot; on 21 June 1945. In July 1946 Pope Pius XII elevated Onderek to &quot;Apostolic Administrator for the Czechoslovak portion of the Archdiocese of Breslau&quot; (colloquially: Apostolic Administration of Český Těšín; ), seated in Český Těšín, thus disentangling the parishes from Breslau&#x27;s jurisdiction. On 31 May 1978 Pope Paul VI merged the apostolic administration into the Archdiocese of Olomouc through his Apostolic constitution &quot;Olomoucensis et aliarum&quot;.

Poland signed a treaty with Czechoslovakia in Warsaw on 13 June 1958 confirming the border as it existed on 1 January 1938. After the Communist takeover of power, the industrial boom continued and many immigrants arrived in the area (mostly from other parts of Czechoslovakia, mainly from Slovakia). The arrival of Slovaks significantly changed the ethnic structure of the area, as almost all the Slovak immigrants assimilated into the Czech majority in the course of time. The number of self-declared Slovaks is rapidly declining. The last Slovak primary school was closed in Karviná several years ago. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Trans-Olza has been part of the independent Czech Republic. However, a significant Polish minority still remains there.

=== In the European Union ===
The entry of both the Czech Republic and Poland to the European Union in May 2004, and especially the entry of the countries to the EU&#x27;s passport-free Schengen zone in late 2007, reduced the significance of territorial disputes, ending systematic controls on the border between the countries. Signs prohibiting passage across the state border were removed, with people now allowed to cross the border freely at any point of their choosing.

The area belongs mostly to the Cieszyn Silesia Euroregion with a few municipalities in the Euroregion Beskydy.

<text>Reggio nell&#x27;Emilia (; ), usually referred to as Reggio Emilia, or simply Reggio by its inhabitants, and known until 1861 as Reggio di Lombardia, is a city in northern Italy, in the Emilia-Romagna region. It has about 171,944 inhabitants and is the main &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of the province of Reggio Emilia.The inhabitants of Reggio nell&#x27;Emilia are called &quot;Reggiani&quot;, while the inhabitants of Reggio di Calabria, in the southwest of the country, are called &quot;Reggini&quot;.

The old town has a hexagonal form, which derives from the ancient walls, and the main buildings are from the 16th–17th centuries. The commune&#x27;s territory lies entirely on a plain, crossed by the Crostolo stream.

==History==
===Ancient and early Middle Ages===

Reggio began as a historical site with the construction by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus of the Via Aemilia, leading from Piacenza to Rimini (187 BC). Reggio became a judicial administration centre, with a forum called at first &quot;Regium Lepidi&quot;, then simply &quot;Regium&quot;, whence the city&#x27;s current name.

During the Roman age Regium is cited only by Festus and Cicero, as one of the military stations on the Via Aemilia. However, it was a flourishing city, a &quot;Municipium&quot; with its own statutes, magistrates and art colleges.

Apollinaris of Ravenna brought Christianity in the 1st century CE. The sources confirm the presence of a bishopric in Reggio after the Edict of Milan (313). In 440 the Reggio diocese was placed under the jurisdiction of Ravenna by Western Roman Emperor Valentinianus III. At the end of the 4th century, however, Reggio had decayed so much that Saint Ambrose included it among the dilapidated cities. Further damage occurred with the Barbarian invasions. After the deposition of Romulus Augustulus in 476 Reggio was part of Odoacer&#x27;s realm. In 489 it came under Ostrogothic control; from 539 it was part of the Roman Empire (Italy), but was taken by Alboin&#x27;s Lombards in 569. Reggio was chosen as Duchy of Reggio seat.

In 773, the Franks took Reggio. Charlemagne gave the bishop the authority to exercise royal authority over the city and established the diocese&#x27; limits (781). In 888, Reggio was handed over to the Kings of Italy. In 899, the Magyars heavily damaged it, killing Bishop Azzo II. As a result of this, new walls were built. On 31 October 900 Emperor Louis III gave authority for the erection of a &quot;castrum&quot; (castle) in the city&#x27;s centre.

In 1002, Reggio&#x27;s territory, together with that of Parma, Brescia, Modena, Mantua and Ferrara, were merged into the March of Tuscany, later held by Matilde of Canossa.

===Free commune===

Reggio became a free commune around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. In 1167 it was a member of the Lombard League and took part in the Battle of Legnano. In 1183 the city signed the Treaty of Konstanz, from which the city&#x27;s consul, Rolando della Carità, received the imperial investiture. The subsequent peace spurred a period of prosperity: Reggio adopted new statutes, had a mint, schools with celebrated masters, and developed its trades and arts. It also increasingly subjugated the castles of the neighbouring areas. At this time the Crostolo stream was deviated westwards, to gain space for the city. The former course of the stream was turned into an avenue called Corso della Ghiara (gravel), nowadays Corso Garibaldi.

The 12th and 13th century, however, were also a period of violent internal struggle between the Scopazzati (meaning &quot;swept away from the city with brooms&quot;, noblemen) and Mazzaperlini (meaning &quot;lice killers&quot;, plebeians) parties, and later those of Ruggeri and Malaguzzi, involved in a bitter domestic rivalry. In 1152 Reggio also warred with Parma and in 1225 with Modena, as part of the general struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. In 1260 25,000 penitents, led by a Perugine hermit, entered the city, and this event calmed the situation for a while, spurring a momentous flourishing of religious fervour. But disputes soon resurfaced, and as early as 1265 the Ghibellines killed the Guelph&#x27;s leader, Caco da Reggio, and gained preeminence. Arguments with the Bishop continued and two new parties formed, the Inferiori and Superiori. Final victory went to the latter.
 
To thwart the abuses of powerful families such as the Sessi, Fogliani and Canossa, the Senate of Reggio gave the city&#x27;s rule for a period of three years to Obizzo II d&#x27;Este. This choice marked the future path of Reggio under the seignory of the latter&#x27;s family, as Obizzo continued to rule &quot;de facto&quot; after his mandate has ceased. His son Azzo was expelled by the Reggiani in 1306, creating a republic ruled by 800 common people. In 1310 the Emperor Henry VII imposed Marquis Spinetto Malaspina as vicar, but he was soon driven out. The republic ended in 1326 when Cardinal Bertrando del Poggetto annexed Reggio to the Papal States.

The city was subsequently under the suzerainty of John of Bohemia, Nicolò Fogliani and Mastino II della Scala, who in 1336 gave it to Luigi Gonzaga. Gonzaga built a citadel in the St. Nazario quarter, and destroyed 144 houses. In 1356 the Milanese Visconti, helped by 2,000 exiled Reggiani, captured the city, starting an unsettled period of powersharing with the Gonzaga. In the end the latter sold Reggio to the Visconti for 5,000 ducats. In 1405 Ottobono Terzi of Parma seized Reggio, but was killed by Michele Attendolo, who handed the city over to Nicolò III d&#x27;Este, who therefore became seignor of Reggio. The city, however, maintained a relevant autonomy, with laws and coinage of its own. Niccolò was succeeded by his illegitimate son Lionello, and, from 1450, by Borso d&#x27;Este.
===Duchy of Reggio===
In 1452, Borso was awarded the title of Duke of Modena and Reggio by Frederick III. Borso&#x27;s successor, Ercole I, imposed heavy levies on the city and appointed the poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, born in the nearby town of Scandiano, as its governor. Later another famous Italian writer, Francesco Guicciardini, held the same position. In 1474, Ludovico Ariosto, author of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, was born in the Malaguzzi palace, near the present day townhall. He was the first son of a knight from Ferrara, who was in charge of the Citadel, and a noblewoman from Reggio, Daria Maleguzzi Valeri. As a grown man he would be sent to Reggio as governor on behalf of the dukes of Ferrara, and would spend time in a villa outside the town (&quot;Il Mauriziano&quot;) that still stands.

In 1513, Reggio was handed over to Pope Julius II. The city was returned to the Este after the death of Hadrian VI on 29 September 1523. In 1551 Ercole II d&#x27;Este destroyed the suburbs of the city in his program of reconstruction of the walls. At the end of the century work on the city&#x27;s famous Basilica della Ghiara began, on the site where a miracle was believed to have occurred. The Este rule continued until 1796, with short interruptions in 1702 and 1733–1734.

===Napoleonic age and restoration===


The arrival of the republican French troops was greeted with enthusiasm in the city. On 21 August 1796, the ducal garrison of 600 men was driven off, and the Senate claimed the rule of Reggio and its duchy. On 26 September, the Provisional Government&#x27;s volunteers pushed back an Austrian column, in the Battle of Montechiarugolo. Though minor, this clash is considered the first one of the Italian Risorgimento. Napoleon himself awarded the Reggiani with 500 rifles and 4 guns. Later he occupied Emilia and formed a new province, the Cispadane Republic, whose existence was proclaimed in Reggio on 7 January 1797. The Italian national flag, named Il Tricolore (three-colours flag), was sewn on that occasion by Reggio women. In this period of patriotic fervour, Jozef Wybicki, a lieutenant in the Polish troops of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, an ally of Napoleon, composed in Reggio the &quot;Mazurek Dąbrowskiego&quot;, which in 1927 became the Polish national anthem.

The 1815 Treaty of Vienna returned Reggio to Francis IV of Austria-Este, but in 1831 Modena rose up against him, and Reggio followed its example organizing a corps under the command of General Carlo Zucchi. However, on 9 March, the Duke conquered the city with his escort of Austrian soldiers.

In 1848, Duke Francis V left his state fearing a revolution and Reggio proclaimed its union with Piedmont. The latter&#x27;s defeat at the Novara brought the city back under the Este control. In 1859 Reggio, under dictator Luigi Carlo Farini, became part of the united Italy and, with the plebiscite of 10 March 1860, definitively entered the new unified Kingdom.

===Contemporary history===

Reggio then went through a period of economic and population growth from 1873 to the destruction of the ancient walls. In 1911, it had 70,000 inhabitants. A strong socialist tradition grew. On 7 July, the city hosted the 13th National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party. On 26 July 1943, the fascist régime&#x27;s fall was cheered with enthusiasm by the Reggiani. Numerous partisan bands were formed in the city and surrounding countryside.

On 27 April 2023 the City of Reggio Emilia is one of the winner of the prize European Capitals of Inclusion and Diversity.

===Jewish history===
Jews began arriving to Reggio in the early 15th century. Many Jews were Sephardim from Spain, Portugal and other parts of Italy. Nearly all were fleeing religious persecution. The Jewish community was prosperous and enjoyed considerable growth for the next several hundred years. The Synagogue of Reggio Emilia was relocated in 1672 into the ghetto, and rebuilt in 1858.

After the Napoleonic era the Jews of Reggio gained emancipation and began to migrate to other parts of Europe looking for greater economic and social freedom. Thus, the Jewish community in Reggio began to lower. The German occupation during World War II and the Holocaust hastened the decline. Today, only one Jew remains in Reggio Emilia. The Jewish Community of Reggio Emilia was merged with Modena&#x27;s. However, an unused synagogue and burial ground still exist. In 2016 the City Council posed some small street plates in front of the houses of the deported Jews to preserve their remembrance.

Many notable rabbinic scholars have resided in Reggio. These include Isaac Foa, Immanuel Sonino, Obadiah ben Israel Sforno, Nathan ben Reuben David Spira, Menahem Azariah Fano, Baruch Abraham ben Elhanan David Foa, Hezekiah ben Isaac Foa, Isaac ben Vardama Foa, Israel Nissim Foa, Israel Solomon Longhi, Isaiah Mordecai ben Israel Hezekiah Bassani, Israel Benjamin ben Isaiah Bassani, Elhanan David Carmi, Benjamin ben Eliezer ha-Kohen, Joshua ben Raphael Fermi, Moses Benjamin Foa, Abram Michael Fontanella, Judah Ḥayyim Fontanella, Israel Berechiah Fontanella, Raphael Jehiel Sanguinetti, Isaac Samson d&#x27;Angeli, R. J. Bolognese, Hananiah Elhanan Ḥai ha-Kohen, Jacob Levi, Moses Benjamin Levi, Israel Berechiah Sanguinetti, David Jacob Maroni, Giuseppe Lattes, Alessandro da Fano, Lazzaro Laide Tedesco, and Shimshon Chaim Nachmani.
==Climate==

The climate in Reggio Emilia is temperate continental, with hot rather moist summers (the temperatures can sometimes rise above 35 °C) (95 °F) and fairly frigid winters with frequent frosts (the temperatures can go below -10 °C) (14 °F). Precipitations are evenly distributed all year long, but October, November and April are the most rainy months, while July and January are the most arid.
In the city you can rarely see snow, even though almost every year there is a period when it is snowing. Due to the rather high temperatures, it does not settle, or if it does, the layer of snow is not very consistent.

During Autumn and Winter it is very common, especially in the areas outside the city, to encounter very thick fog, even though nowadays it is less frequent than in the past. Other meteorological phenomena that one can expect in the area is the hard rain, freezing rain during winter, and hail during summer but rarely during spring.

The area is not particularly windy and there are often days of total calm, especially during the anticyclonic phases in winter, while spring is more ventilated. The most intense winds are the ones blowing from North-East (Bora) or from South-West (Libeccio). The latter, during its descent from the Northern Apennines, it sometimes tends to become a downslope wind and thus being very dry and hot. In rare and particular conditions, the downwind of the Alps, the Foehn, can reach Reggio Emilia from the North-West. In Reggio Emilia, the average annual high temperature is , the annual low temperature is , and the annual precipitation is .

==Childhood education==

The Reggio Emilia approach to preschool education was started by the schools of Reggio Emilia after World War II and is well known around the world. It is based and inspired on theories of Malaguzzi, Bruner, Vygotsky, Dewey, Piaget and Gardner. Reggio Emilia holds the Loris Malaguzzi International Centre, a modern structure where the Reggio Emilia approach is implemented, exported and spread around the world.

==Economy==
The economy of the province of Reggio Emilia was for a long time based on agriculture. One typical product, known worldwide and imitated, is Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Another is Lambrusco wine. Reggio Emilia produce also the &quot;Balsamic Vinegar&quot;, a condiment for salad but also cheese, strawberries and many other dishes. 
In the twentieth century Reggio Emilia and its territory saw also a rapid development of small and medium industries, particularly in the sector of agricultural machinery. For more than 100 years, there has been a strong tradition that supported the development of consumers&#x27;cooperatives, as well as, building and banking cooperatives. New developments in mechanics and information technology are at the origin of some new companies operating in mechatronics. Another well-established sector is the ceramic tiles industry (mainly concentrated in the districts of Scandiano and Casalgrande). 
Other leading sectors include: electronics (Cellular Line, Phonocar, RCF audio); finance (Credito Emiliano); fashion (Marina Rinaldi, Max Mara); food (Newlat); machinery (ARGO SpA, Emak, Interpump Group, Landi Renzo, Lombardini S.r.l.; Preston &amp; Barbieri, Smeg (appliances)); utilities ().

The industrial growth has attracted immigration from North and Central Africa, East Europe, and Far East (China, Pakistan, India). The immigration rate in the province is about 25%.
Researches on the quality of life indicate that in recent years Reggio Emilia is in very good position among Italian provinces.

==Transport==

Reggio Emilia railway station, opened in 1859, forms part of the Milan–Bologna railway. It is also a terminus of three secondary railways, linking Reggio Emilia with Ciano d&#x27;Enza, Guastalla and Sassuolo, respectively. The station is situated at Piazza Guglielmo Marconi, at the eastern edge of the city centre.

The other major railway station, Reggio Emilia AV Mediopadana, is on the Milan–Bologna high-speed railway (there is also a connection with Reggio Emilia-Guastalla railway). It is located at the Mancasale locality, approximately north from the city centre.

Along with this, there is a plan to construct a tram in the city. The tram will run from the Mancasale Industrial zone in the north to Rivalta in the south, stopping at the Reggio Emilia AV Mediopadana railway station, Reggio Emilia railway station and other neighborhoods. The tram system has undergone a feasibility study, and is set to open in 2026.

==Sports==
Reggio Emilia is home to various professional sports clubs and arenas:

===Bridges===

* Autostrada A1 bridges, three bridges designed by Santiago Calatrava and opened in 2005–2006. The three bridges connect the Austostrada del Sole A1 (the main Italian north to south motorway) to the city of Reggio Emilia. A central arch bridge spans the Milan-Bologna high-speed railway line and the motorway, while twin cable-stayed bridges are at either end. The twin bridges pass over service roundabouts and access roads to allow connections with the adjacent Reggio Emilia AV Mediopadana high-speed railway station.
:In 2009, the European Convention for Constructional Steelwork gave the three bridges a European Steel Design Award, stating that the twin bridges&#x27; original visual effects at different angles give the two bridges &quot;the aspect of huge musical instruments.&quot;

<text>Martha Skelton Jefferson (&quot;née&quot; Wayles; October 30, 1748 – September 6, 1782) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson from 1772 until her death. She served as First Lady of Virginia during Jefferson&#x27;s term as governor from 1779 to 1781. She died in 1782, 19 years before he became president.

Of the six children born to Thomas and Martha, only two survived to adulthood, Martha and Mary. Martha died four months after the birth of her last child. The couple&#x27;s letters to one another were burned, though by whom is unknown, and Thomas rarely spoke of her, so she remains a somewhat enigmatic figure. (Similarly, Jefferson did not speak much of his mother, Jane Randolph Jefferson.)

As a widower, Thomas had a long-standing relationship and children with Martha&#x27;s half-sister, Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman who was three-quarters white by descent.

== Early life and education ==
Martha Wayles was born on October 30, 1748 (O.S. October 19, 1748), the only surviving child born to Martha Eppes Wayles (1721–1748) and John Wayles (1715–1773), near Colonial Williamsburg in Charles City County, Virginia. 

Martha&#x27;s mother, Martha Eppes Wayles, had previously given birth to twins in 1746, but neither survived; the girl was stillborn and the boy died hours after his birth. Martha was nicknamed &quot;Patsy&quot;. Martha&#x27;s father John was a Lancaster-born emigrant to the Thirteen Colonies who worked as an attorney and prosperous planter and slave trader. In addition, he was an agent for the Farrell and Jones company based in Bristol, undertaking activities such as debt collection on their behalf. Martha Eppes Wayles was a daughter of Francis Eppes, a settler of the Bermuda Hundred, an early Virginian colony established along the Appomattox River. While little is known of Martha Eppes Wayles&#x27; life, she had an appreciation for fine literature, such as her favorite novel, &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; and &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque.&quot; (Her rebound version of the book, &quot;The Adventures of Telemachus&quot;, contains her signature on the title page and resides at the Library of Congress).

Martha Wayles had two stepmothers, neither of whom lived long after their marriages to John Wayles, and through one stepmother she had four half-sisters. Wayles married Tabitha Cocke, of Malvern Hill. They had four children: Sarah, Elizabeth, Tabitha and Anne. Sarah died in infancy. Tabitha and Anne married the Skipwith brothers, Robert and Henry, respectively. Tabitha Skipwith died with her first childbirth. Nancy Skipwith, &quot;Aunty Skipwith&quot; to the Jefferson children and grandchildren, died in 1798. Elizabeth married Francis Eppes, Martha&#x27;s cousin, and had two sons, Richard and John Wayles Eppes, the latter of whom married Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s second daughter, Mary Jefferson. Wayles&#x27; second wife died most likely after the birth of Anne in August 1756 and before he married his third wife in January 1760.

On January 26, 1760, Wayles married his third wife, Elizabeth Lomax Skelton (she was the widow of Reuben Skelton, an older brother of Bathurst Skelton, his daughter Martha&#x27;s first husband). Without producing a child with Wayles, she died on February 10, 1761. John Wayles then took Betty Hemings as a mistress, and gave Martha additional half-siblings. Martha likely received her education—including literature, dance, music, French language and Bible study— from private tutors or women in the family. She became the &quot;Lady of the House&quot; after her second stepmother died when she was 13 years of age and was often a hostess to John Wayles&#x27; social events and helped manage his business and household affairs. She knew how to make candles, soap, butter and remedies for illnesses.

==Marriages and children==
Martha Wayles first married Bathurst Skelton (born 1744), an attorney, on November 20, 1766, at age 18. Their son, John, was born on November 7, 1767. Skelton died on September 30, 1768. Martha then moved back to The Forest following her husband&#x27;s death. Three-year-old John died on June 10, 1771.

===Thomas Jefferson===

Thomas Jefferson, likely began courting Martha in December 1770. They shared an interest in horse-back riding, literature, and music. As part of Martha&#x27;s dowry for their January 1, 1772 wedding, Thomas and Martha received property, including the Elk Hill plantation, where Martha had lived with her first husband, and a great number of slaves, which helped Thomas complete the construction of the Monticello residence and landscaping of the estate&#x27;s 5,000 acres. While Monticello was undergoing construction and Thomas was away, Martha often stayed at the Elk Hill plantation.

They had six children, but only two daughters reached adulthood. An unnamed son, Jane Randolph, and Lucy Elizabeth, who died of whooping cough, died as infants. Only the eldest, Martha &quot;Patsy&quot; Jefferson, survived past the age of 26:
* Martha &quot;Patsy&quot; Jefferson (September 27, 1772October 10, 1836)
* Jane Randolph Jefferson (April 3, 1774September 1775)
* unnamed son (May 28June 14, 1777), lived for 17 days
* Mary &quot;Maria or Polly&quot; Jefferson (August 1, 1778April 17, 1804)
* Lucy Elizabeth Jefferson (November 3, 1780April 15, 1781)
* Lucy Elizabeth Jefferson (May 8, 1782) 

==Slaves and Wayles&#x27; estate==
Martha and Thomas Jefferson acquired a number of slaves as part of her dowry for her marriage, and later from the estate of John Wayles, which made Thomas the second largest slave owner in Albemarle County. The dowry increased the number of slaves he owned from 52 to 187.

Among the more than 100 enslaved Black and Indigenous people were Betty Hemings, of mixed-race ancestry, and her 10 mixed-race children. The youngest, an infant, was Sally Hemings. The six youngest were three-quarters white in ancestry and half-siblings of Martha Wayles Jefferson, as they were fathered by her father. Betty also had four children born before those of Wayles&#x27;. All the Hemings family members gained privileged positions among the slaves at Monticello, where they were trained and worked as domestic servants, chefs, and highly skilled artisans. Sally Hemings, who was fathered by John Wayles, was the half-sister of Martha Wayles Jefferson, and the subject of a scandal about her relationship with Thomas Jefferson.

Martha&#x27;s father, John Wayles, died at age 58 in 1773. He left substantial property, including slaves, but the estate was encumbered with debt. Upon Wayles&#x27; death, Betty Hemings and her six children with John Wayles were moved &quot;without hesitancy&quot; to Monticello to prevent the Hemings from being separated. The estate was worth £30,000, but was in debt to Farrell and Jones in Briston for £11,000. Wayles three sons-in-law, including Thomas Jefferson, decided to break up the estate and its debts. Martha and her husband Thomas Jefferson inherited the Willis Creek and Elk Hill plantations and a total of 135 people, including members of the Hemings family. They also inherited £4,000 in debt. Jefferson and other co-executors of the Wayles estate worked for years to clear the debt and the overwhelming debt led to Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s financial ruin.

==Contemporaneous descriptions==
No contemporaneous portraits of Martha Jefferson survive, but she has been described by family members and Isaac Granger Jefferson as small, graceful, and pretty, and like her daughter, Mary Jefferson Eppes. She was described by Robert Skipwith, her sister&#x27;s husband, as having possessed &quot;... the greatest fund of good nature ... that sprightliness and sensibility which promises to ensure you the greatest happiness mortals are capable of enjoying.&quot; As Thomas was having Monticello built, he obtained a piano forte from England for Martha as a wedding present. She played the harpsichord piano forte, while Thomas Jefferson played violins. Martha reportedly played the harpsichord &quot;very skillfully and who, is in all respects, a very agreeable sensible and accomplished lady,&quot; according to a Hessian officer, Jacob Rubsamen, who visited Monticello in 1780.

According to her daughter, Martha Jefferson was highly educated and musical, a constant reader, with a good nature and a vivacious temper that sometimes bordered on tartness. She had great affection for her husband. She was a little over tall, with a lithe figure, auburn hair, and hazel eyes. She was an accomplished needlewoman, some of her embroidery still exists. Martha maintained a collection of notes regarding her household duties and recipes, such as butchering and curing meat and the creation of large batches of soft and hard soap, candles, and beer. During her first year of marriage, she began the practice of brewing beer, producing that year.

==First lady of Virginia==
Martha Jefferson was First Lady of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the American Revolution. In that capacity, and in response to a request from Martha Washington, Mrs. Jefferson led a drive among the women of Virginia to raise funds and supplies for her state&#x27;s militia in the Continental Army to the extent that her health permitted. The letter to James Madison&#x27;s mother, Eleanor Conway Madison, is the only letter written by Martha Jefferson known to now exist. She published an appeal in the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot;, announcing that collections would be taken in the churches. Nationally, the Ladies Association raised $300,000 to buy linen shirts for Washington&#x27;s army.

==Health problems==
Managing the Jefferson household became increasingly difficult for Martha Jefferson, who had endured at least one case of smallpox, may have had diabetes, and was weakened by her numerous pregnancies, which would ultimately kill her. She bore the stress of having to flee a British invasion of Richmond in early January 1781 and a raid on Monticello in June of that year and was aware that the British were interested in capturing her or her husband. The baby, Lucy Elizabeth I, fell ill during the January evacuation and never recovered, dying in 1781 on April 15.

Thomas limited his political service due to her health. Jefferson was in Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress in 1776, where he drafted the Declaration of Independence over a period of two weeks in June 1776. He wished to return to her as soon as possible. Thomas served as governor and in the House of Delegates in Virginia. He declined the offer to serve as the commissioner to France made by the Continental Congress while she was alive.

==Death==
The birth of Lucy Elizabeth II, their youngest child, in May 1782 was reportedly the most difficult pregnancy for Mrs. Jefferson, since the infant was over 16 pounds at birth. Edmund Randolph wrote in the month of her death that Thomas was &quot;inconsolable&quot; about Martha&#x27;s declining health and pain.&quot; 

Mrs. Jefferson&#x27;s health worsened and she died on September 6, 1782, four months after the birth of her last child. 

She was buried at Monticello and her tombstone was inscribed with words written by Thomas, the closing of which read: &quot;Torn from him by death. September 6, 1782. This monument of his love is inscribed&quot;. 

So that her children would not grow up with stepmothers, Martha had asked Thomas Jefferson to never marry again, and he never did. Her request has been attributed to her own disagreeable relationships with her stepmothers. At her death, she was 33; he was 39.

==Legacy==
Martha Jefferson was portrayed by Blythe Danner in the 1972 film &quot;1776&quot;.

<text>The 2004 Spanish Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Gran Premio Marlboro de España 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 9 May 2004 at the Circuit de Catalunya, Montmeló, Spain. It was Race 5 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 66-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Ferrari team. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second with Jarno Trulli third in a Renault car.

==Report==

===Background===
Heading into the fifth race of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was leading the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 40 points; Rubens Barrichello was second on 24 points, 16 points behind Schumacher. Behind Schumacher and Barrichello in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, BAR driver Jenson Button was third on 23 points, with Juan Pablo Montoya and Fernando Alonso on 18 and 16 points respectively. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari were leading on 64 points and Renault were second on 31 points, with Williams third on 27 points.

===Friday drivers===
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

===Practice and qualifying===
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final practice sessions were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes.

The qualifying session was run as a one-lap session and took place on Friday and Saturday afternoon. The cars were run one at a time; the Friday running order was determined with the Championship leading heading out first. The Saturday running order was determined by times set in Friday afternoon qualifying with the fastest heading out last and the slowest running first. The lap times from the Friday afternoon session did not determine the grid order.

===Race===
The race started at 14:00 local time. During the warm-up lap of the race, a man calling himself Jimmy Jump ran through the starting grid, only to be apprehended soon by the security. While he claimed to have many fans (due to his other performances at football matches), he was criticized for risking the lives of the drivers, even though the cars were still travelling at low speed at this point.

Michael Schumacher dominated a largely uneventful race leading home his team-mate Rubens Barrichello. The most notable result was that of the McLaren team, with their drivers Kimi Räikkönen and David Coulthard finishing a lap down and outside of the points scoring positions, a far cry from their usual championship-contending performance.

<doc id="644221" wikidata="Q1374123" url="?curid=644221" title="Petr Nedvěd">
<text>Petr Nedvěd (born December 9, 1971) is a Czech-Canadian former professional ice hockey player who spent 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1990 and 2007.

==Early career==
Nedvěd was born in Liberec, Czechoslovakia to Jaroslav and Soňa (&quot;Sonia&quot;) Nedvěd. He left Czechoslovakia as a refugee on January 2, 1989, at the age of 17 after playing in an international midget tournament in Calgary. Nedvěd was the star of the tournament, with 17 goals and nine assists. He decided to defect to Canada because of the limited opportunities in Czechoslovakia under communist rule, which was very strict regarding athletes leaving the country to pursue professional careers elsewhere. He did not tell his parents about the decision, and with $20 and the help of another Czech who defected, whom Nedvěd refuses to identify even today, he declared his defection at a Calgary police station. In an interview in the &quot;Newark Star Ledger&quot;, Nedvěd said that the &quot;fear of regret&quot; was the overriding reason to defect. For ten months until the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in the Velvet Revolution, Nedvěd&#x27;s parents were forced to make calls imploring Nedvěd to come home.

==Playing career==
After his defection, Nedvěd played one season for the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League and was drafted second overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft after scoring 145 points in 71 games. Expected to be an instant star in the NHL, his first two seasons were a disappointment, as he struggled offensively and earned a reputation for soft play. In 1992–93, he finished with 38 goals and 71 points including a club record 15-game point-scoring streak. Despite this, though, he struggled in the playoffs and earned the ire of Canucks fans when he asked his idol Wayne Gretzky for a game stick immediately following the team&#x27;s ouster from the playoffs by the Los Angeles Kings, an action fans felt symbolized the lack of commitment to winning from a player who scored just three goals in 28 playoff games as a Canucks player.

Prior to the 1993–94 season, Nedvěd became involved in a bitter contract dispute with the Canucks which resulted in a lengthy holdout. While holding out, Nedvěd obtained his Canadian citizenship, and represented Canada at the 1994 Winter Olympics, winning a silver medal. His situation was finally resolved just before the NHL trade deadline, when he was signed by the St. Louis Blues, with Craig Janney ultimately awarded to the Canucks as compensation (and then dealt back to the Blues shortly after for Jeff Brown, Bret Hedican and Nathan LaFayette). Nedvěd scored 20 points in 19 games, but again struggled in the playoffs as the Blues were swept in the first round.

Nedvěd&#x27;s stay in St. Louis would prove a short one, as he was dealt to the New York Rangers for the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season. He finished the year with 23 points in 46 games.

For the 1995–96 season, Nedvěd was on the move again, this time dealt to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a blockbuster trade. In Pittsburgh, Nedvěd would have the best years of his career on an offensive team featuring superstars Mario Lemieux, Jaromír Jágr, and Ron Francis. In his first year in Pittsburgh, he recorded career highs of 45 goals and 99 points, and also put his playoff demons behind him by scoring 20 points in helping the Penguins reach the conference finals. Included in that was a monumental goal against the Washington Capitals in a quadruple-overtime thriller, which at 79:15 of overtime was at the time the longest NHL game in 60 years. During the 1996–97 season, he enjoyed another solid year, finishing with 33 goals and 71 points.

However, Nedvěd would find himself in another major contract dispute, and miss the entire 1997–98 season, instead spending most of the year toiling for lower-level teams in the Czech Republic. He remained unsigned at the start of the 1998–99 campaign, instead suiting up with the Las Vegas Thunder of the IHL. The situation would finally end two months into the season when he was dealt back to the New York Rangers in a deal involving Alexei Kovalev. The lengthy holdout would turn out to be a colossal blunder for Nedvěd, as he actually ended up with less money (once the millions of dollars he&#x27;d given up by missing a season were factored in) than had he accepted Pittsburgh&#x27;s initial offer back in 1997, while at the same time he ended up missing an extended portion of the prime of his career and severely damaged his reputation around the league.

Nedvěd&#x27;s second stint in New York would be more successful than the first, and the six seasons he would spend with the Rangers would represent the most stable portion of his career. Although the team would struggle and miss the playoffs every year through this stretch, Nedvěd would be a consistent offensive performer, leading the Rangers in scoring twice and finishing second on another occasion. In 2000–01, playing with Jan Hlaváč and Radek Dvořák – a trio dubbed the &#x27;Czech Mates&#x27; – he had the second-best season of his career, finishing with 32 goals and 78 points.

Suffering through a disappointing 2003–04 season, Nedvěd was dealt to the Edmonton Oilers at the trade deadline. Although Edmonton failed to make the playoffs, Nedvěd scored 15 points in 16 games as the team went on a late-season surge.

Nedvěd signed with the Phoenix Coyotes in 2004 and spent the 2004–05 NHL lockout with HC Sparta Praha of the Czech Extraliga. Returning to NHL action in 2005–06 with the Coyotes, he struggled badly, scoring just two goals and 11 points in 25 games. He was dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers, where his play improved somewhat and he scored a further 14 points in 28 games, and returned to the NHL playoffs for the first time since 1997.
The 2006–07 season again started poorly for Nedvěd, and he was placed on waivers on October 18 following a 9–1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres, and was assigned to the American Hockey League (AHL) for the first time in his career. After bouncing between the NHL and AHL for the next two months, Nedvěd was claimed on re-entry waivers by the Edmonton Oilers, who hoped he could provide the same sort of spark he did when acquired in 2004. However, he continued to struggle in Edmonton and finished the season with just two goals and 12 points in 40 games between Edmonton and Philadelphia.

On July 19, 2007, Nedvěd signed a one-year contract to return to HC Sparta Praha.

On July 31, 2008, Nedvěd, attempting to make an NHL comeback, was invited to the New York Rangers training camp on a tryout basis. He was released by the Rangers on September 26 and returned to the Extraliga, this time with his hometown HC Bílí Tygři Liberec.

On May 4, 2012, at age 40, Nedvěd returned to the Czech Republic national team in the 2012 IIHF World Championship hosted in Finland and Sweden.
On May 10, 2012, Nedvěd became the oldest Team Czech Republic player to score a goal in World Championship. He scored game-winning goal against Latvia at the age of 40 years, 6 months and 1 day.

On January 6, 2014, Nedvěd was named to the Czech team for the 2014 Sochi Olympics. He played in five games as the Czech Republic finished 6th.

On March 13, 2014, Nedvěd played his last career game with Bílí Tygři Liberec in a 6–2 home loss against the HC Vítkovice Steel. He officially announced his retirement after the game.

* 1989–90 – Rookie of the Year (CHL)
* 1993–94 – silver medal (1994 Winter Olympics)
* 2011–12 – bronze medal (2012 IIHF World Championship)

==Personal life==
Nedvěd married supermodel Veronika Vařeková in 2004. In early 2006, when playing for the Phoenix Coyotes, Nedvěd asked for a trade to an Eastern Conference team to be closer to Vařeková who worked primarily in New York City. However, during the summer of 2006, Nedvěd and Vařeková separated. He has since moved back to the Czech Republic. His brother, defenceman Jaroslav Nedvěd, is also an ice hockey player.

==Legacy==
In the 2009 book &quot;100 Ranger Greats&quot;, the authors ranked Nedvěd at No. 71 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team&#x27;s first 82 seasons.

<text>Rachel Jackson (&quot;née&quot; Donelson; June 15, 1767 – December 22, 1828) was the wife of Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States. She lived with him at their home at the Hermitage, where she died just days after his election and before his inauguration in 1829—therefore she never served as first lady, a role assumed by her niece, Emily Donelson.

Rachel Jackson was married at first to Lewis Robards in Nashville. In about 1791, she eloped with Andrew Jackson, believing that Robards had secured the couple a divorce. It was later revealed that he had not, meaning that her marriage to Jackson was inadvertently bigamous. They were forced to remarry in 1794 after the divorce had been finalized.

She had a close relationship with her husband. She was usually anxious while he was away tending to military or political affairs. A Presbyterian, Rachel was noted for her deep religious piety. During the deeply personal prelude to the 1828 election, she was the subject of extremely negative attacks from the supporters of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s opponent, John Quincy Adams. Jackson believed that these attacks had hastened her death, and thus blamed his political enemies.

==Early life and education==
Rachel Donelson was born near the Banister River, about ten miles from Chatham, Virginia, in Pittsylvania County on June 15, 1767. Her father was Colonel John Donelson (1718–1785), co-founder of Nashville, Tennessee, and her mother was Rachel Shockley Donelson (1730–1801). Her great-grandfather Patrick Donelson was born in Scotland about 1670. She had seven brothers and three sisters:
*Alexander Donelson (1749–1785)
*Mary Donelson Caffery (born 1751). Wife of Captain John Caffery. Parents of Jane Caffrey wife of painter Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl and of Donelson Caffrey (1786–1835), father of Senator Donelson Caffery (1835–1906).
*Catherine Donelson Hutchings (1752–1835)
*Shockley Donelson (1753–1804)
*Jane Donelson Hays (1754–1834)
*John Donelson (1755–1830), father of Emily Donelson, first wife of Andrew Jackson Donelson; grandfather of CS General John Donelson Martin (1830–1862)
*William Donelson (1756–1820)
*Samuel Donelson (1758–1804), father of Andrew Jackson Donelson and CS General Daniel Smith Donelson
*Severn Donelson (1763– or 1773–1818)
*Leven Donelson (born 1765)

From about 1770 to 1779, her father operated the Washington Iron Furnace at Rocky Mount, Franklin County, Virginia. With her family, she moved to Tennessee at the age of 12. Her father led about 600 people from Fort Patrick Henry to Fort Nashborough, down the Cumberland River. The Donelson family were among the first white settlers in Tennessee.

== Appearance and personality ==
Rachel attracted much attention from suitors because she was very beautiful as a young woman, described by a contemporary as having &quot;lustrous black eyes, dark glossy hair, full red lips, brunette complexion, though of brilliant coloring, [and] a sweet oval face rippling with smiles and dimples.&quot; Later in life, her country manners and full figure were severely in contrast with Jackson&#x27;s tall, spindly form and developed genteel manners. However, her love for her husband was unmistakable: she languished when he was away for politics, fretted when he was away at war, and doted on him when he was at home. Unlike Jackson, Rachel never liked being in the spotlight of events. She would consistently warn her husband not to let his political accomplishments rule him; for example, after Jackson&#x27;s victory at the Battle of New Orleans, she warned Jackson that his subsequent popularity (on the scope of George Washington) would tempt him to value his glory over his own family.

She was a Presbyterian. She was also an avid reader of the Bible and religious works as well as poetry. 

According to a letter written in 1828 by her sister Jane Donelson Hays from her new home in Madison County, Tennessee, Rachel was close to her sisters, many of whom had lived in close proximity to each other in Middle Tennessee: &quot;How does my dear sister Jackson do? I cannot take up my bonnet and meet you at sister Betsy&#x27;s or sister Mary&#x27;s...smoke our pipes, laugh and talk over occurrences of former days, each one taking the words out of the others mouth...It was a pleasant neighborhood.&quot;

==First marriage==
Rachel Donelson&#x27;s first marriage to Captain Lewis Robards of Harrodsburg, Kentucky, a landowner and speculator, was not happy, and the two separated in 1790. According to Marcia Mullins of the Hermitage in Nashville, Tennessee, there were rumors that Lewis Robards was cruel and jealous. Believing that her husband would file a petition for divorce, she returned to the Donelson family home.

In contrast, Ann Toplovich, executive director of the Tennessee Historical Society, writes that Rachel Donelson Robards knowingly left her husband for Andrew Jackson in late 1789, eloping to Spanish-controlled Natchez.

== Relationship with Andrew Jackson ==
When Andrew Jackson migrated to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1788, he boarded with Rachel Stockley Donelson, the mother of Rachel Donelson Robards. The two became close, and shortly after, they married in Natchez, Mississippi. Rachel believed that her husband had obtained a divorce, but as it had never been completed, her marriage to Jackson was inadvertently bigamous and therefore invalid.

Rachel&#x27;s marital status was complicated by the distances involved and the changing governmental authorities. During the process of Rachel and Robards&#x27;s divorce, Kentucky became a state instead of a territory of Virginia, and North Carolina turned over management of the territory including Tennessee to the federal government. These complicating factors were understood by locals and the unusual circumstances of the Jackson marriage were not greatly discussed in Nashville society.

In 1793, Andrew and Rachel Jackson learned that although Lewis Robards had filed for divorce, the divorce had never been granted. This made Rachel a bigamist and an adulteress, as well as making General Jackson, soon a politician on the rise, an adulterer. On the grounds of Rachel&#x27;s abandonment and adultery, Lewis Robards was granted a divorce in 1794. At about the same time, the legitimacy of the Jackson marriage was questioned because they were married in then-Spanish-controlled Natchez, Mississippi. The Jacksons were Protestants, and only Catholic marriages were recognized as legal unions in that territory. After the divorce was legalized, Andrew and Rachel were married in Davidson County, Tennessee by Robert Hays, Rachel&#x27;s brother-in-law and a justice of the peace.

Ann Toplovich of the Tennessee Historical Society argues that the above narrative, of unintentional bigamy and unintentional adultery, has concealed the fact of Rachel&#x27;s agency and exercise of self-determination, and doesn&#x27;t &quot;give this strong woman credit for choosing a better husband&quot;. Toplovich explains that this narrative was concocted during Andrew Jackson&#x27;s candidacy for president in the 1828 election: in order to &quot;combat the attacks on Jackson’s character and Rachel’s virtue, the Jackson campaign formed the Nashville Committee [...][which] published a story with a new timeline and circumstances of the Jackson marriage — the alternative facts of the Jackson campaign were that Rachel thought she was already divorced when she joined her fate to Andrew Jackson in 1791.&quot;

== Children ==

Although the Jacksons never had biological children, they adopted her nephew in 1809 and named him Andrew Jackson Jr. When his father became president, Andrew Jr. assumed management of the Hermitage farm. He married Sarah Yorke of Philadelphia on November 24, 1831.

In 1813, the Jacksons adopted a Muscogee infant who had been orphaned by troops commanded by Rachel&#x27;s niece&#x27;s husband John Coffee at the Battle of Tallushatchee. Lyncoya was one of three Indigenous children brought to live at the Hermitage during the Creek War; Lyncoya, Theodore, and Charley were characterized as &quot;pets&quot; for the white adoptees and wards who lived there. Lyncoya was educated along with Andrew Jr., and Jackson had aspirations of sending him to West Point, as well. Political circumstances made that impossible, and he instead trained as a saddle maker in Nashville. He died of tuberculosis on June 1, 1828.

Around 1817 the Jacksons adopted Andrew Jackson Hutchings who was the grandson of Rachel&#x27;s sister and the son of Jackson&#x27;s slave-trading partner John Hutchings. He attended school with Andrew Jr. and Lyncoya. He then attended colleges in Washington and Virginia while Jackson was president. In 1833, he married Mary Coffee, daughter of Jackson&#x27;s friend John Coffee, and moved to Alabama. Hutchings died in 1841.

Andrew Jackson served as the guardian for the children of Captain Edward Butler, Adjutant General and Inspector General of the United States Army from July 1793 until May 1794, and the children of Rachel&#x27;s brother Samuel Donelson&#x27;s son. These children did not live with the Jacksons full time. Andrew Jackson Donelson, son of Rachel&#x27;s brother Samuel, became Jackson&#x27;s protégé, and served as personal secretary to Jackson during his presidency.

== Election of 1828 and death==
According to Toplovich, John Quincy Adams&#x27; presidential campaigns targeted Jackson&#x27;s &quot;passion and lack of self-control&quot; in both 1824 and 1828, &quot;making it central to the argument that he would devastate the integrity of the Republic and its institutions.&quot; One newspaper ran an article asking, &quot;&#x27;Ought a convicted adulteress and her paramour husband to be placed in the highest offices of this free and Christian land?&#x27;&quot;

The publicity surrounding her and the public knowledge of what was considered a very private matter caused Rachel to sink into depression. She reputedly told a friend &quot;I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than live in that palace in Washington.&quot; Adding to her stress, in 1828, Lyncoya Jackson died at the Hermitage. Between the scandal, her son&#x27;s death, and a heart condition she spent much of the campaign depressed and crying.
She died suddenly on December 22, 1828, at the age of 61 of a heart attack, given her symptoms according to Jackson: &quot;excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast.&quot;; symptoms that are typically on par for heart attacks in women. That her death came immediately before Jackson left for Washington was more than an inconvenience; it was crippling. He held her body tightly until he was pulled away, and he lingered at the Hermitage until the latest possible date.

Even though her maladies began as early as 1825, and she was a cigar smoker, Jackson always blamed his political enemies for her death. &quot;May God Almighty forgive her murderers&quot;, Jackson swore at her funeral, &quot;I never can.&quot;

She was buried on the grounds at the Hermitage wearing the white dress and shoes she had bought for the inaugural ball. Her epitaph, written by John Eaton, who would later become involved in the Peggy Eaton scandal during the Jackson Administration, reads: &quot;A being so gentle and so virtuous slander might wound, but could not dishonor.&quot;

==Memorials==
The Rachel Jackson State Office Building, in Nashville, Tennessee, built in 1985, was named for her.

==Popular culture depictions==
Rachel Jackson was the title character of a 1951 historical novel by Irving Stone, &quot;The President&#x27;s Lady&quot;, which told the story of her life with Andrew Jackson. In 1953, the novel was made into a film of the same name starring Susan Hayward and Charlton Heston as the Jacksons. In the 1936 film &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; (a fictionalized biography of Peggy Eaton), Rachel Jackson was portrayed by Beulah Bondi, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. In December 1956, she was portrayed by Maureen Stapleton in the Studio One episode &quot;Rachel&quot;. She also appears as a character in the stage musical Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, which includes multiple jokes about bigamy.

<text>Computer-aided translation (CAT), also referred to as computer-assisted translation or computer-aided human translation (CAHT), is the use of software, also known as a translator, to assist a human translator in the translation process. The translation is created by a human, and certain aspects of the process are facilitated by software; this is in contrast with machine translation (MT), in which the translation is created by a computer, optionally with some human intervention (e.g. pre-editing and post-editing).

CAT tools are typically understood to mean programs that specifically facilitate the actual translation process. Most CAT tools have (a) the ability to translate a variety of source file formats in a single editing environment without needing to use the file format&#x27;s associated software for most or all of the translation process, (b) translation memory, and (c) integration of various utilities or processes that increase productivity and consistency in translation.

== Range of tools ==

Computer-assisted translation is a broad and imprecise term covering a range of tools. These can include:
* Translation memory tools (TM tools), consisting of a database of text segments in a source language and their translations in one or more target languages.
* Spell checkers, either built into word processing software, or available as add-on programs.
* Grammar checkers, either built into word processing software, or available as add-on programs. 
* Terminology managers, which allow translators to manage their own terminology bank in an electronic form. This can range from a simple table created in the translator&#x27;s word processing software or spreadsheet, a database created in a program such as FileMaker Pro or, for more robust (and more expensive) solutions, specialized software packages such as SDL MultiTerm, LogiTerm, Termex, TermWeb, etc.
* Electronic dictionaries, either unilingual or bilingual, also known as Dictorobotaries.
* Terminology databases, either on the host computer or accessible through the Internet, such as TERMIUM Plus or Grand dictionnaire terminologique from the Office québécois de la langue française
* Full-text search tools (or indexers), which allow the user to query already translated texts or reference documents of various kinds. Some such indexers are ISYS Search Software, dtSearch Desktop and Naturel. Most modern translation management system solutions include this as a standard feature.
* Concordancers, which are programs that retrieve instances of a word or an expression and their respective context in a monolingual, bilingual or multilingual corpus, such as a bitext or a translation memory
* Bitext aligners: tools that align a source text and its translation which can then be analyzed using a full-text search tool or a concordancer
* Project management software that allows linguists to structure complex translation projects in the form of a chain of tasks (often called &quot;workflow&quot;), assign various tasks to different people, and track the progress of each of these tasks.

== Concepts ==

===Translation memory software===
Translation memory programs store previously translated source texts and their equivalent target texts in a database and retrieve related segments during the translation of new texts.

Such programs split the source text into manageable units known as &quot;segments&quot;. A source-text sentence or sentence-like unit (headings, titles or elements in a list) may be considered a segment. Texts may also be segmented into larger units such as paragraphs or small ones, such as clauses. As the translator works through a document, the software displays each source segment in turn, and provides a previous translation for re-use if it finds a matching source segment in its database. If it does not, the program allows the translator to enter a translation for the new segment. After the translation for a segment is completed, the program stores the new translation and moves on to the next segment. In the dominant paradigm, the translation memory is, in principle, a simple database of fields containing the source language segment, the translation of the segment, and other information such as segment creation date, last access, translator name, and so on. Another translation memory approach does not involve the creation of a database, relying on aligned reference documents instead.

Some translation memory programs function as standalone environments, while others function as an add-on or macro for commercially available word-processing or other business software programs. Add-on programs allow source documents from other formats, such as desktop publishing files, spreadsheets, or HTML code, to be handled using the TM program. For an example, see MEMOrg.

===Language search-engine software===
New to the translation industry, Language search-engine software is typically an Internet-based system that works similarly to Internet search engines. Rather than searching the Internet, however, a language search engine searches a large repository of Translation Memories to find previously translated sentence fragments, phrases, whole sentences, even complete paragraphs that match source document segments.

Language search engines are designed to leverage modern search technology to conduct searches based on the source words in context to ensure that the search results match the meaning of the source segments. Like traditional TM tools, the value of a language search engine rests heavily on the Translation Memory repository it searches against.

===Terminology management software===
Terminology management software provides the translator a means of automatically searching a given terminology database for terms appearing in a document, either by automatically displaying terms in the translation memory software interface window or through the use of hot keys to view the entry in the terminology database. Some programs have other hotkey combinations allowing the translator to add new terminology pairs to the terminology database on the fly during translation. Some of the more advanced systems enable translators to check, either interactively or in batch mode, if the correct source/target term combination has been used within and across the translation memory segments in a given project. Independent terminology management systems also exist that can provide workflow functionality, visual taxonomy, work as a type of term checker (similar to spell checker, terms that have not been used correctly are flagged) and can support other types of multilingual term facet classifications such as pictures, videos, or sound.

===Alignment software===
The process of binding a source language segment to its corresponding target language segment.
The purpose is to create a translation memory database or to add to an existing one.

===Interactive machine translation===
Interactive machine translation is a paradigm in which the automatic system attempts to predict the translation the human translator is going to produce by suggesting translation hypotheses. These hypotheses may either be the complete sentence, or the part of the sentence that is yet to be translated.

===Augmented translation===
Augmented translation is a form of human translation carried out within an integrated technology environment that provides translators access to subsegment adaptive machine translation (MT) and translation memory (TM), terminology lookup (CAT), and automatic content enrichment (ACE) to aid their work, and that automates project management, file handling, and other ancillary tasks.

Based on the concept of augmented reality, augmented translation seeks to make translators more productive by providing them with relevant information on an as-needed basis. This information adapts to the habits and style of individual translators in order to accelerate their work and increase productivity. It differs from classical postediting of MT, which has linguists revise entire texts translated by machines, in that it provides machine translation and information as suggestions that can be adopted in their entirety, edited, or ignored, as appropriate.

Augmented translation extends principles first developed in the 1980s that made their way into CAT tools. However, it integrates several functions that have previously been discrete into one environment. For example, translators historically have had to leave their translation environments to do terminology research, but in an augmented environment, an ACE component would automatically provide links to information about terms and concepts found in the text directly within the environment.

As of May 2017, no full implementations of an augmented translation environment exist, although individual developers have created partial systems.

<doc id="644230" wikidata="Q544203" url="?curid=644230" title="Riva (band)">
<text>Riva was a Croatian pop band formed in Zadar in 1986.

After forming in 1986, the band appeared on Zagrebfest 1988, Performing with the song &quot;Zadnja Suza&quot; (&quot;Last Tear&quot; in Croatian). 

Their song &quot;Rock Me&quot; won the Eurovision Song Contest 1989 in Switzerland, with a score of 137 points. According to author John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor in &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History&quot;, it was an unexpected win. The band brought the first and only victory for Yugoslavia. The contest was then hosted in Zagreb, representing Yugoslav Radio Television.

After the success, they released two subsequent albums, one titled after their winning track &quot;Rock Me&quot; (1989) and &quot;Srce Laneta&quot; (&quot;Deer Fawn&#x27;s Heart&quot; in Croatian) in 1990. 

Shortly after the success of both albums, the band signed to a Swiss Agency where they started production on their planned 3rd album titled &quot;Lude Glave, Lude Godine&quot; (&quot;Crazy Heads, Crazy Years&quot; in Croatian) with Per Gessle of popular pop rock duo Roxette to be featured with whom they were supposed to be opening acts for on a world tour. 

Disagreements arose when the Swiss Agency misrepresented the validity of Croatia as a then recently independent country, opting for the band to remain as being from Yugoslavia for press purposes as well as the bands performances focusing on humanitarian issues in Croatia to help victims of the Yugoslav Wars. 

Feeling betrayed by the agency&#x27;s portrayal of what was happening in their hometown at the time the members cut all ties with the agency, with frontwoman Emilija Kokić stating in a 2019 interview : 

&quot;&quot;We come from Zadar, our families are huddled in basements because grenades of the Serbian army are falling on Zadar, and we would act like Yugoslavians How? That would be the biggest betrayal! They would become people to whom a career means more than anything&quot;.&quot; 

After the resignation, the planned album which was scheduled for release remained unreleased with only 3 songs from the album being available from their performance at the Croatian Eurovision preselection Dora in 1993. 

During 1991 the band decided to have a hiatus originally planned to be short, which ended up being the end of Riva as members focused on their own personal lives with only very few small reunions taking place between 1993 and 2016.

<doc id="644233" wikidata="Q1115575" url="?curid=644233" title="Civil parish">
<text>In England, a civil parish is a type of administrative parish used for local government. It is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government. Civil parishes can trace their origin to the ancient system of parishes, which for centuries were the principal unit of secular and religious administration in most of England and Wales. Civil and religious parishes were formally split into two types in the 19th century and are now entirely separate. Civil parishes in their modern form came into being through the Local Government Act 1894 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73), which established elected parish councils to take on the secular functions of the parish vestry.

A civil parish can range in size from a sparsely populated rural area with fewer than a hundred inhabitants, to a large town with a population in excess of 100,000. This scope is similar to that of municipalities in continental Europe, such as the communes of France. However, unlike their continental European counterparts, parish councils are not principal authorities, and in most cases have a relatively minor role in local government.

, there are 10,464 parishes in England, and in 2020 they covered approximately 40% of the English population. For historical reasons, civil parishes predominantly cover rural areas and smaller urban areas, with most larger urban areas being wholly or partly unparished; but since 1997 it has been possible for civil parishes to be created within unparished areas if demanded by local residents. In 2007 the right to create civil parishes was extended to London boroughs, although only one, Queen&#x27;s Park, has so far been created.

Eight parishes also have city status (a status granted by the monarch). A civil parish may be equally known as and confirmed as a town, village, neighbourhood or community by resolution of its parish council, a right not conferred on other units of English local government. The governing body of a civil parish is usually an elected parish council (which can decide to call itself a town, village, community or neighbourhood council, or a city council if the parish has city status). Alternatively, in parishes with small populations (typically fewer than 150 electors) governance may be by a parish meeting which all electors may attend; alternatively, parishes with small populations may be grouped with one or more neighbours under a common parish council.

Wales was also divided into civil parishes until 1974, when they were replaced by communities, which are similar to English parishes in the way they operate. Civil parishes in Scotland were abolished for local government purposes by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929; the Scottish equivalent of English civil parishes are the community council areas established by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which have fewer powers than their English and Welsh counterparts. There are no equivalent units in Northern Ireland.

==History==
===Ancient parishes===
The parish system in Europe was established between the 8th and 12th centuries, and an early form was long established in England by the time of the Norman Conquest. These areas were originally based on the territory of manors, which, in some cases, derived their bounds from Roman or Iron Age estates; some large manors were sub-divided into several parishes.

Initially, churches and their priests were the gift and continued patronage (benefaction) of the lord of the manor, but not all were willing and able to provide, so residents would be expected to attend the church of the nearest manor with a church. Later, the churches and priests became to a greater extent the responsibility of the Catholic Church thus this was formalised; the grouping of manors into one parish was recorded, as was a manor-parish existing in its own right.
Boundaries changed little, and for centuries after 1180 &#x27;froze&#x27;, despite changes to manors&#x27; extents. However, by subinfeudation, making a new smaller manor, there was a means of making a chapel which, if generating or endowed with enough funds, would generally justify foundation of a parish, with its own parish priest (and in latter centuries vestry). This consistency was a result of canon law which prized the status quo in issues between local churches and so made boundary changes and sub-division difficult.

The consistency of these boundaries until the 19th century is useful to historians, and is also of cultural significance in terms of shaping local identities; reinforced by the use of grouped parish boundaries, often, by successive local authority areas; and in a very rough, operations-geared way by most postcode districts. There was (and is) wide disparity in parish size. Writtle, Essex traditionally measures – two parishes neighbouring are Shellow Bowells at , and Chignall Smealy at 

Until the break with Rome, parishes managed ecclesiastical matters, while the manor was the principal unit of local administration and justice. Later, the church replaced the manor court as the rural administrative centre, and levied a local tax on produce known as a tithe. In the medieval period, responsibilities such as relief of the poor passed increasingly from the lord of the manor to the parish&#x27;s rector, who in practice would delegate tasks among his vestry or the (often well-endowed) monasteries. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the power to levy a rate to fund relief of the poor was conferred on the parish authorities by the Poor Relief Act 1601. Both before and after this optional social change, local (vestry-administered) charities are well-documented.

The parish authorities were known as vestries and consisted of all the ratepayers of the parish. As the number of ratepayers of some parishes grew, it became increasingly difficult to convene meetings as an open vestry. In some, mostly built-up, areas the select vestry took over responsibility from the entire body of ratepayers. This innovation improved efficiency, but allowed governance by a self-perpetuating elite. The administration of the parish system relied on the monopoly of the established English Church, which for a few years after Henry VIII alternated between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, before settling on the latter on the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558. By the 18th century, religious membership was becoming more fractured in some places, due in part to the progress of Methodism. The legitimacy of the parish vestry came into question, and the perceived inefficiency and corruption inherent in the system became a source for concern in some places. For this reason, during the early 19th century the parish progressively lost its powers to &quot;ad hoc&quot; boards and other organisations, such as the boards of guardians given responsibility for poor relief through the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. Sanitary districts covered England in 1875 and Ireland three years later. The replacement boards were each entitled to levy their own rate in the parish; the church rate ceased to be levied in many parishes and became voluntary from 1868.

===Civil and ecclesiastical split===
During the 17th century it was found that the 1601 Poor Law did not work well for very large parishes, which were particularly common in northern England. Such parishes were typically subdivided into multiple townships, which levied their rates separately. The Poor Relief Act 1662 therefore directed that for poor law purposes &#x27;parish&#x27; meant any place which maintained its own poor, thereby converting many townships into separate &#x27;poor law parishes&#x27;.

As the administration of the poor laws was the main civil function of parishes, the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866, which received royal assent on 10 August 1866, declared all areas that levied a separate rate or had their own overseer of the poor to be parishes. This included the Church of England parishes (until then simply known as &quot;parishes&quot;), extra-parochial areas, townships and chapelries. To have collected rates this means these beforehand had their own vestries, boards or equivalent bodies. Parishes using this definition subsequently became known as &quot;civil parishes&quot; to distinguish them from the ecclesiastical parishes.

The Church of England parishes, which cover more than 99% of England, have become officially (and to avoid ambiguity) termed &quot;ecclesiastical parishes&quot;. The limits of many of these have diverged; most greatly through changes in population and church attendance (these factors can cause churches to be opened or closed). Since 1921, each has been the responsibility of its own parochial church council.

In the late 19th century, most of the &quot;ancient&quot; (a legal term equivalent to time immemorial) irregularities inherited by the civil parish system were cleaned up, and the majority of exclaves were abolished. The census of 1911 noted that 8,322 (58%) of &quot;parishes&quot; in England and Wales were not geographically identical when comparing the &quot;civil&quot; to the &quot;ecclesiastical&quot; form.

===1894 reforms===
In 1894, civil parishes were reformed by the Local Government Act 1894 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. 73) to become the smallest geographical area for local government in rural areas. The act abolished the civil (non-ecclesiastical) duties of vestries. Parishes which straddled county boundaries or sanitary districts had to be split so that the part in each urban or rural sanitary district became a separate parish (see List of county exclaves in England and Wales 1844–1974). The sanitary districts were then reconstituted as urban districts and rural districts, with parishes that fell within urban districts classed as urban parishes, and parishes that fell within rural districts were classed as rural parishes.

====Rural parishes====
The 1894 act established elected civil parish councils as to all rural parishes with more than 300 electors, and established annual parish meetings in all rural parishes. Civil parishes were grouped to form either rural or urban districts which are thereafter classified as either type. The parish meetings for parishes with a population of between 100 and 300 could request their county council to establish a parish council. Provision was also made for a grouped parish council to be established covering two or more rural parishes. In such groups, each parish retained its own parish meeting which could vote to leave the group, but otherwise the grouped parish council acted across the combined area of the parishes included.

====Urban parishes====
Urban civil parishes were not given their own parish councils, but were directly administered by the council of the urban district or borough in which they were contained. Many urban parishes were coterminous (geographically identical) with the urban district or municipal borough in which they lay. Towns which included multiple urban parishes often consolidated the urban parishes into one. The urban parishes continued to be used as an electoral area for electing guardians to the poor law unions. The unions took in areas in multiple parishes and had a set number of guardians for each parish, hence a final purpose of urban civil parishes. With the abolition of the Poor Law system in 1930, urban parishes became a geographical division only with no administrative power; that was exercised at the urban district or borough council level.

===19651974 reforms===
In 1965 civil parishes in London were formally abolished when Greater London was created, as the legislative framework for Greater London did not make provision for any local government body below a London borough. (Since the new county was beforehand a mixture of metropolitan boroughs, municipal boroughs and urban districts, no extant parish councils were abolished.)

In 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 retained rural parishes, but abolished most urban parishes, as well as the urban districts and boroughs which had administered them. Provision was made for smaller urban districts and boroughs to become successor parishes, with a boundary coterminous with an existing urban district or borough or, if divided by a new district boundary, as much as was comprised in a single district. There were 300 such successor parishes established. In urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes, the parishes were simply abolished, and they became unparished areas. The distinction between types of parish was no longer made; whether parishes continued by virtue of being retained rural parishes or were created as successor parishes, they were all simply termed parishes. The 1972 act allowed the new district councils (outside London) to review their parishes, and many areas left unparished in 1972 have since been made parishes, either in whole or part. For example, Hinckley, whilst entirely unparished in 1974, now has four civil parishes, which together cover part of its area, whilst the central part of the town remains unparished.

===Sub-divisions===
Some parishes were sub-divided into smaller territories known as hamlets, tithings or townships.

===Revival===
Nowadays the creation of town and parish councils is encouraged in unparished areas. The Local Government and Rating Act 1997 created a procedure which gave residents in unparished areas the right to demand that a new parish and parish council be created. This right was extended to London boroughs by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 – with this, the City of London is at present the only part of England where civil parishes cannot be created. If enough electors in the area of a proposed new parish (ranging from 50% in an area with less than 500 electors to 10% in one with more than 2,500) sign a petition demanding its creation, then the local district council or unitary authority must consider the proposal.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, numerous parish councils have been created, including some relatively large urban ones. The main driver has been the desire to have a more local tier of government when new larger authorities have been created, which are felt to be remote from local concerns and identity. A number of parishes have been created in places which used to have their own borough or district council; examples include Daventry (2003), Folkestone (2004), Kidderminster (2015) and Sutton Coldfield (2016). The trend towards the creation of geographically large unitary authorities has been a spur to the creation of new parishes in some larger towns which were previously unparished, in order to retain a local tier of government; examples include Shrewsbury (2009), Salisbury (2009), Crewe (2013) and Weymouth (2019). In 2003 seven new parish councils were set up for Burton upon Trent, and in 2001 the Milton Keynes urban area became entirely parished, with ten new parishes being created.

Parishes can also be abolished where there is evidence that this is in response to &quot;justified, clear and sustained local support&quot; from the area&#x27;s inhabitants. Examples are Birtley, which was abolished in 2006, and Southsea, abolished in 2010.

==Governance==

Every civil parish has a parish meeting, which all the electors of the parish are entitled to attend. Generally a meeting is held once a year. A civil parish may have a parish council which exercises various local responsibilities prescribed by statute. Parishes with fewer than 200 electors are usually deemed too small to have a parish council, and instead will only have a parish meeting: an example of direct democracy. Alternatively several small parishes can be grouped together and share a common parish council, or even a common parish meeting.

A parish council may decide to call itself a town council, village council, community council, neighbourhood council, or if the parish has city status, the parish council may call itself a city council. According to the Department for Communities and Local Government, in England in 2011 there were 9,946 parishes. Since 1997 around 100 new civil parishes have been created, in some cases by splitting existing civil parishes, but mostly by creating new ones from unparished areas.

===Powers and functions===
Parish or town councils have very few statutory duties (things they are required to do by law) but have a range of discretionary powers which they may exercise voluntarily. These powers have been defined by various pieces of legislation. The role they play can vary significantly depending on the size, resources and ability of the council, but their activities can include any of the following:

Parish councils have powers to provide and manage various local facilities; these can include allotments, cemeteries, parks, playgrounds, playing fields and village greens, village halls or community centres, bus shelters, street lighting, roadside verges, car parks, footpaths, litter bins and war memorials. Larger parish councils may also be involved in running markets, public toilets and public clocks, museums and leisure centres.

Parish councils may spend money on various things they deem to be beneficial to their communities, such as providing grants to local community groups or local projects, or fund things such as public events, crime prevention measures, community transport schemes, traffic calming or tourism promotion.

Parish councils have a role in the planning system; they have a statutory right to be consulted on any planning applications in their areas. They may also produce a neighbourhood plan to influence local development.

The Localism Act 2011 allowed eligible parish councils to be granted a &quot;general power of competence&quot; which allows them within certain limits the freedom to do anything an individual can do provided it is not prohibited by other legislation, as opposed to being limited to the powers explicitly granted to them by law. To be eligible for this, a parish council must meet certain conditions such as having a clerk with suitable qualifications.

=== Funding ===
Parish councils receive funding by levying a &quot;precept&quot; on the council tax paid by the residents of the parish (or parishes) served by the parish council. In a civil parish which has no parish council, the parish meeting may levy a council tax precept for expenditure relating to specific functions, powers and rights which have been conferred on it by legislation. In places where there is no civil parish (unparished areas), the administration of the activities normally undertaken by the parish becomes the responsibility of the district or borough council. The district council may make an additional council tax charge, known as a Special Expense, to residents of the unparished area to fund those activities. If the district council does not opt to make a Special Expenses charge, there is an element of double taxation of residents of parished areas, because services provided to residents of the unparished area are funded by council tax paid by residents of the whole district, rather than only by residents of the unparished area.

===Councillors and elections===
Parish councils comprise volunteer councillors who are elected to serve for four years. Decisions of the council are carried out by a paid officer, typically known as a parish clerk. Councils may employ additional people (including bodies corporate, provided where necessary, by tender) to carry out specific tasks dictated by the council. Some councils have chosen to pay their elected members an allowance, as permitted under part 5 of the Local Authorities (Members&#x27; Allowances) (England) Regulations 2003.

The number of councillors varies roughly in proportion to the population of the parish. Most rural parish councillors are elected to represent the entire parish, though in parishes with larger populations or those that cover larger areas, the parish can be divided into wards. Each of these wards then returns councillors to the parish council (the numbers depending on their population). Only if there are more candidates standing for election than there are seats on the council will an election be held. However, sometimes there are fewer candidates than seats. When this happens, the vacant seats have to be filled by co-option by the council. If a vacancy arises for a seat mid-term, an election is only held if a certain number (usually ten) of parish residents request an election. Otherwise the council will co-opt someone to be the replacement councillor.

The Localism Act 2011 introduced new arrangements which replaced the &#x27;Standards Board regime&#x27; with local monitoring by district, unitary or equivalent authorities. Under new regulations which came into effect in 2012 all parish councils in England are required to adopt a code of conduct with which parish councillors must comply, and to promote and maintain high standards. A new criminal offence of failing to comply with statutory requirements was introduced. More than one &#x27;model code&#x27; has been published, and councils are free to modify an existing code or adopt a new code. In either case the code must comply with the Nolan Principles of Public Life.

===Status and styles===
A parish can be granted city status by the Crown. , eight parishes in England have city status, each having a long-established Anglican cathedral: Chichester, Ely, Hereford, Lichfield, Ripon, Salisbury, Truro and Wells.

The council of an ungrouped parish may pass a resolution giving the parish the status of a town, at which point the council becomes a town council. Around 400 parish councils are called town councils.

Under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, a civil parish may be given one of the following alternative styles:

*community
*neighbourhood
*village

As a result, a parish council can be called a town council, a community council, a village council or occasionally a city council (though most cities are not parishes but principal areas, or in England specifically metropolitan boroughs or non-metropolitan districts).

The chairman of a town council will have the title &quot;town mayor&quot; and that of a parish council which is a city will usually have the title of mayor.

===Charter trustees===
When a city or town has been abolished as a borough, and it is considered desirable to maintain continuity of the charter, the charter may be transferred to a parish council for its area. Where there is no such parish council, the district council may appoint charter trustees to whom the charter and the arms of the former borough will belong. The charter trustees (who consist of the councillor or councillors for the area of the former borough) maintain traditions such as mayoralty. An example of such a city was Hereford, whose city council was merged in 1998 to form a unitary Herefordshire. The area of the city of Hereford remained unparished until 2000 when a parish council was created for the city. As another example, the charter trustees for the City of Bath make up the majority of the councillors on Bath and North East Somerset Council.

==Geography==

Civil parishes cover 35% of England&#x27;s population, with one in Greater London and few in the other conurbations. Civil parishes vary greatly in population: some have populations below 100 and have no settlement larger than a hamlet, while others cover towns with populations of tens of thousands. Weston-super-Mare, with a population of 71,758, is the most populous civil parish. In many cases small settlements, today popularly termed villages, localities or suburbs, are in a single parish which originally had one church.

Large urban areas are mostly unparished, as the government at the time of the Local Government Act 1972 discouraged their creation for large towns or their suburbs, but there is generally nothing to stop their establishment. For example, Birmingham has two parishes (New Frankley and Sutton Coldfield), Oxford has four, and the Milton Keynes urban area has 24. Parishes could not however be established in London until the law was changed in 2007.

A civil parish can range in area from a small village or town ward to a large tract of mostly uninhabited moorland in the Cheviots, Pennines or Dartmoor. The two largest as at December 2023 are Stanhope (County Durham) at , and Dartmoor Forest (Devon) at . The two smallest are parcels of shared rural land: Lands Common to Axminster and Kilmington (Devon) at , and Lands Common to Brancepeth and Brandon and Byshottles (County Durham) at . The next two smallest are parishes in built up areas: Chester Castle (Cheshire) at (no recorded population) and Hamilton Lea (Leicestershire) at (1,021 residents at the 2021 census).

===Deserted parishes===
The 2001 census recorded several parishes with no inhabitants. These were Chester Castle (in the middle of Chester city centre), Newland with Woodhouse Moor, Beaumont Chase, Martinsthorpe, Meering, Stanground North (subsequently abolished), Sturston, Tottington, and Tyneham (subsequently merged). The lands of the last three were taken over by the Armed Forces during World War II and remain deserted.

In the 2011 census, Newland with Woodhouse Moor and Beaumont Chase reported inhabitants, and there were no new deserted parishes recorded.

=== General abolition of anomalies===

Nearly all instances of detached parts of civil parishes (areas not contiguous with the main part of the parish) and of those straddling counties have been ended. 14 examples remain in England as at 2022, including Barnby Moor and Wallingwells, both in Nottinghamshire.

Direct predecessors of civil parishes are most often known as &quot;ancient parishes&quot;, although many date only from the mid 19th century. Using a longer historical lens the better terms are &quot;pre-separation (civil and ecclesiastical) parish&quot;, &quot;original medieval parishes&quot; and &quot;new parishes&quot;. The &quot;Victoria County History&quot;, a landmark collaborative work mostly written in the 20th century (although incomplete), summarises the history of each English &quot;parish&quot;, roughly meaning late medieval parish. A minority of these had exclaves, which could be:
* an enclave within another parish,
* surrounded by more than one other parish, or
* a pene-enclave, partly surrounded by sea.

In some cases an exclave of a parish (a &quot;detached part&quot;) was in a different county. In other cases, counties surrounded a whole parish meaning it was in an unconnected, &quot;alien&quot; county. These anomalies resulted in a highly localised difference in applicable representatives on the national level, justices of the peace, sheriffs, bailiffs with inconvenience to the inhabitants. If a parish was split then churchwardens, highway wardens and constables would also spend more time or money travelling large distances. Some parishes straddled two or more counties, such as Todmorden in Lancashire and Yorkshire.

Such anomalies mostly arose in the height of the feudal system, when parishes evolved. Major land interests (manor proper or church lands) may have acquired non-contiguous parcels of land i.e. beyond the original parish/county bounds or what would become the boundaries of a new parish. Those extraterritorial land parcels influenced the formation of parish boundaries where the parcels were significant to the parish. Thus secular land in an exclave, almost always manor, may have been the site of a prosperous farmstead, or remained part of the manor for generations, or the lord/lady of the manor may have held the right to appoint the parish priest (advowson) or co-founded the church as its patron. The scenario may also have arisen originally as an attempt to diversify the lord&#x27;s (or overlord&#x27;s) interests, or from a large burial ground in an urban setting. It could also arise from a chance inheritance. It caused inconvenience to the residents of most exclaves/enclaves (where not numerous or economically significant enough to have their own chapel of ease as to religious matters and a vestry as to civil matters). They had to attend a distant church and/or the manorial court for certain tithes, rates, baptisms, marriages, funerals, or to obtain regular poor relief and most forms of education, charitable alms and hospitalry.

The end of manorial courts coincided with growing agricultural innovation, fragmentation of land ownership and housing growth. The church and vestries were reluctant to bring boundaries up to date. This meant such anomalies were irrelevant nuisances with a real economic cost in distance of administration and confusion. They began to be remedied nationally in statute by Parliament in the early 19th century in the Poor Law Reforms of 1834, and was more widely in 1844 when the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 moved most parishes which were partly or wholly in an alien county. The remaining exclaves of counties were transferred in the 1890s and in 1931, with one exception: an exclave of Tetworth, surrounded by Cambridgeshire, was removed in 1965 from Huntingdonshire.

Other acts, including the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act 1882 eliminated instances of civil parishes being split between counties, so that by 1901 Stanground in Huntingdonshire and the Isle of Ely was the last example; it was split into two parishes, one in each county, in 1905.

The Church of England has only abolished these where locally incepted (under the Anglican and the Catholic principle of subsidiarity). This means it has essentially kept, often divided in urban areas, the original parishes. The Church&#x27;s main website has an accessible map, showing parish boundaries church-by-church.

<doc id="644236" wikidata="Q1936813" url="?curid=644236" title="Replay value">
<text>Replay value (or, colloquially, replayability) is the potential of a video game or other media products for continued play value after its first completion. Factors that can influence perceived replay value include the game&#x27;s extra characters, secrets and alternate endings. The replay value of a game may also be based entirely on the individual&#x27;s tastes. A player might enjoy repeating a game because of the music, graphics, gameplay or because of product loyalty. Dynamic environments, challenging AI, a wide variety of ways to accomplish tasks, and a rich array of assets could result in a high replay value.

==Influencing factors==
===Plot===

A game with a linear plot will typically have a lower replay value due to the limited choices a character can make. Games that offer more choices in regard to what the player can do, such as strategy games, roguelikes or construction and management sims, tend to have higher replay value since the player might be able to make each play through different.

As a non-video game example, consider the difference between a &quot;traditional&quot; book and a choose-your-own-adventure book. For a traditional book the reader will read it from start to finish, and should they choose to re-read it the plot would remain constant, thus offering the same experience the second time around. The plot of a choose-your-own-adventure book, on the other hand, is more varied and different events would occur, some that the reader might not have seen the last time they read it, prompting the reader to read through the book again even if they have done so just moments before.

In the case of role-playing video games (RPGs), plots can be linear or non-linear. The plots of older RPGs tended to show little to no plot changes with each play-through. A good example of an RPG with a non-linear plot is &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;. Role-playing games released in later years allow for more freedom. For instance, choosing to be ruthless instead of lenient might prevent certain events from taking place (or even cause new ones to occur). Likewise, allowing a particular character into the party could cause the plot to branch off in a new direction, if even for a short time. A good example of this point is the character Juhani in &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. The player has the option of killing her or sparing her life. Should the player be merciful, Juhani joins the player&#x27;s party. Later in the game, the player will then run into an enemy from her past.

===Multiple classes===

This is the ability to play as different characters each time through the game. For example, the game &quot;Diablo&quot; allows the player to choose one of three character classes: warrior, rogue, or sorcerer. Party-based RPGs can have a good degree of replayability, even if the plot is essentially linear. The plot of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; remained the same with each play through, but since the player was able to choose their party of four from six different classes they could choose a new party configuration with each new game. The &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; instruction manual even gave the player ideas for different types of parties (well-balanced, heavy magic use, combat-oriented characters, etc.). In &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; the players can choose from the classes of Fighter, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Monk, and Red Mage, providing the player with 15 possible character combinations with 4 distinct classes, or 126 with repetition. In &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;, the player has to obtain their classes, called Blades, through a gacha system. While panned by a lot of critics, this system allowed players to replay the game multiple times and have a completely new team of blades by the end of the game allowing each playthrough of the game to be different as long as the player doesn&#x27;t go for 100% and try to obtain all of them.

Multitude of classes, accompanied by a multitude of races, is another typical characteristic of roguelike games. For example, &quot;Dungeon Crawl&quot; at this moment employs 22 races and 23 classes, allowing a total of 654 race/class combinations (although about a dozen of them are disallowed due to in-game race/religion constraints). Typically, some races are more suited for some classes, and much less suited towards others (an ogre usually makes a great fighter, but a very lousy wizard). Such &quot;unsuited&quot; combinations may prove an extra challenge for an experienced player, yet it&#x27;s not frequent for this challenge to be high to the point of the game being unwinnable.

===Multiple characters===

In some RPGs, such as &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot;, the player controls the leader of a party of characters, and additional members will join the group if the player makes the right decisions. It is unlikely that a player will &quot;collect&quot; every possible member on their first attempt, so they may choose to play through the story again in order to acquire the full cast.

Different characters offer new ways to tackle the obstacles within the game. They may also offer unique dialogue options and opportunities to interact with other players. The SquareSoft RPG &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; was an example of this with over 40 characters available for play.

In the case of action-oriented games, there may be some areas in the game that are only reachable using a character with certain abilities. For example, in the Sega game &quot;Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot;, the character Knuckles can explore areas that other characters cannot.

Some games might offer a wide array of characters from whom to choose to play, but gamers are usually deterred from replaying if all characters share the same storyline and function more or less the same. This is the case of &quot;&quot; and its sequel: the player can choose one out of three mercenaries to play with, but the storyline remains the same, and the differences in gameplay (speed, strength and stealth) are too subtle to invite further replays.

===Alternate paths===
Some games give the player a choice of which path they want to take through the game. Two good examples are &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; and &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;. In &quot;Castlevania III&quot;, the hero Trevor Belmont can choose which path he takes to Dracula&#x27;s castle. Additionally, the route he takes allows him to encounter three different companions. In &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, Shadow must choose to do Neutral (self-work), Dark (evil work) or Hero (Heroic Work) in a stage (i.e. choosing whether to destroy all the humans in Dark, destroy all the black aliens in Hero, or to collect the Chaos Emeralds for himself in Neutral), and depending on what Shadow does, this will affect the next stage played and the storyline. There are 10 endings in the game that range from Shadow destroying Earth to Shadow accepting he was destructive throughout his life and that he himself shouldn&#x27;t exist. Once all endings are unlocked, a true/canonical ending is played.

The first two &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games featured two main scenarios, each with its own protagonist, supporting characters and scripted sequence of events. Choosing one character over the other usually meant following his/her own storyline, set along different routes but in the same location and occasionally crossing paths with the other character. Scenarios would differ by balancing odds and obstacles - an action-oriented scenario for the strong, male protagonist and a more puzzle-oriented scenario for the comparatively weaker, but faster female protagonist. Beating each scenario was required to get 100% completion, as well as all aspects of the story.

In the point-and-click game genre, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; offers three paths. The paths are called; Wits, Fists and Team paths. In the first two paths Indiana Jones leaves alone depending to complete mission basses on either thinking (wits) or fighting (fists) whereas in the third Sophia (team) tags along. Another example appears in the game &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, where Ray McCoy has to decide where to head and with precise timing events might occur otherwise an alternate path then must be taken. These paths are random and some require time-accurate triggering.

Procedural generation in roguelike games, leads to high replayability, as no two games are alike.

===Performance grading===
A number of modern multi-level games, especially puzzle games, encourage players to repeat and fully master previously completed levels with a star rating or a letter-grading system, in which the player will be graded for how well they performed in finishing each level. Such a system intends to encourage players to find ways to play certain levels better than they did before and gain a sense of satisfactory completion and closure from achieving the highest performance rating for each level. This is evident in games like &quot;Angry Birds&quot; and the &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot; trilogy. PlatinumGames are famous for this, games like &quot;Bayonetta&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Rising Revengeance&quot; have easy-to-play but hard-to-master gameplay that encourages players to try and get the highest scores possible. This is also the case for the &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; series.

===Unlockable characters and content===

Sometimes beating the game or completing certain challenges will allow the player to use an NPC from the game or even a new character. For instance, in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot;, the drow ranger Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden is an unlockable character. Other examples of unlockable content can include art, music, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and interviews with a game&#x27;s producer, artist, or voice talent. Electronic Arts&#x27; games based on &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; feature many different unlockables of this nature. As the player progresses through the game, he can view production stills from the movies, concept art, and interviews with some of the actors. Completing either game unlocks new characters, missions, and cheat codes.

Many games enhance replayability by unlocking a second, minor story mode once the main game is beaten. This second story or sub-scenario usually functions on the same game physics/mechanics and is set in an already explored area, and its main function is to expand on the main game&#x27;s story and its unanswered questions, often focusing on a secondary character now turned protagonist and his/her point of view. &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; features a &#x27;Revers/Rebirth&#x27; sub-scenario that differs from regular gameplay and centers on a secondary character Riku rather than Sora. This story plays during and after the events of the main game. Likewise, the &#x27;Separate Ways&#x27; mini-game of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; has the player take hold of Ada Wong, whose path intertwines with that of the game&#x27;s protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy. The same plot points and events are retold from her perspective. A re-edited version of &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; features the &#x27;Born From a Wish&#x27; scenario, chronicling events prior to the game&#x27;s main scenario through the eyes of key character Maria.

===Alternate endings===

One of the most common ways to increase the replay value of a game is to offer multiple endings. These endings are often based on the choices the player makes during the game, like choosing to be good or evil. An early example of alternate endings was &quot;Metroid&quot;, having increasingly revealing endings depending on how fast the player completed the game. Later games in the series would determine the ending based on either time or completeness (sometimes both), but &quot;&quot; and the Japanese version of &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; included art galleries unlocked through getting an ending, meaning a player must obtain all endings to complete the galleries. Several games based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series make use of alternate endings, such as &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot;, and &quot;Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot;. The endings for these games are based on whether the player chooses the Light Side or the Dark Side of the Force. Sometimes, the endings can just be for entertainment purposes, like in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, when the player completes the game twice, instead of having to do Eric&#x27;s line, he punches Eric and takes the tape. &quot;&quot; is another game with multiple endings. During the course of the adventure, the player will need to make decisions (such as choosing whether to save Nightcrawler or Jean Grey) or complete certain tasks (like stopping a group of mutated soldiers from destroying a computer that holds research on the Legacy Virus). After completing the game, Uatu the Watcher will give a glimpse into the future and tell the player what the consequences of his or her actions are.

Of note is how the &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; games make use of several of these factors to increase replay value. In the first &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; game, the player chooses one of three classes: soldier, scout, or scoundrel. Later in the game, the player chooses one of the three Jedi classes (Guardian, Sentinel, or Counselor). Thus, the player has nine possible character combination choices. In &quot;Knights II&quot;, the player starts as one of these three Jedi classes and gets to choose a prestige class. Additionally, the player gains different followers depending on whether they select to be male or female and Light Side or Dark Side. Both games allow the player to customize their characters by selecting various skills and feats. Thus, a player might choose to focus on two-weapon fighting for one play through and single-weapon fighting in the next.

The &quot;Silent Hill&quot; franchise is famous for featuring at least three alternate endings per game. Often, a game will force a specific ending on the first play-through, upon which new alternate endings will unlock during a replay, should the player meet certain requirements, perform certain tasks or obtain certain objects. &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; alone features a total of six possible endings - three regular endings, which can be obtained after the first play-through, as well as a bonus ending following a replay, and two unlockable &quot;joke endings&quot;. Almost all games feature a joke &quot;UFO ending&quot;, whereupon UFOs descend from the sky in an unlikely turn of events. Because there is little narrative continuity between the games, there are no canonical endings, except those of &quot;Silent Hill: Origins&quot; and the original &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (due to each having sequels which corroborate one specific ending). Because of the multiplicity of outcomes, unlockable features and the canonical blurr, these alternate endings are considered to enhance replayability.

Many RPGs feature alternate endings, depending on player choices and quests completed. To unlock the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; secret ending, one must complete the game 100% by fulfilling all mini-game sidequests and collectables, beating all tournament enemies and locking each world&#x27;s keyhole. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; features 13 endings, which are based on when the player defeats Lavos.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; features two endings, where Niko Bellic is asked by his associate Jimmy Pegorino to strike a deal with his bitter enemy Dimitri Rascalov or exact revenge on him. Niko remains triumphant in both endings and the two main antagonists, Dimitri and Pegorino, die. The main difference between the two endings is that either Niko&#x27;s cousin Roman Bellic or his love interest Kate McReary end up dying. What is ironic is that the one who gives him advice is the one to end up dying. The outcome of the war in &quot;Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction&quot; depends on the player&#x27;s current standing with each of the game&#x27;s factions. The one who stands the friendliest with the player will be featured as the victor of the war, though the game&#x27;s sequel establishes China as the canonical victor.

In &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot;, players are given the option of completing the game with seven different endings. Five of these are deemed false as they are determined through in-game wealth, karma, and certain choices throughout the game. The &quot;true&quot; endings are called so due to the unique ending which triggers a cut-scene involving the protagonist. GSC Game World, the creator of the series, also came out with two other &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; games. &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat&quot; offers a more varied ending path with 20 different affecting actions. Some say the game has over 200 endings.

The game &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is another example of such with as many as thirteen multiple endings. Depending on choices, timings and multiple event triggers, the player can end up with one of the many endings. Each ending doesn&#x27;t have a fixed path and can be reached through any path depending on before mentioned factors.

==Online gaming==

In massively multiplayer online games and other types of online game, the other human-controlled players give the gameplay a greater variety than permitted by the AI of computer-controlled bots, as well as allowing chatting and other interaction between players, thus increasing the length of time the player will spend on the game.

==Other factors==

Games where the map and starting position are different every time the players play it, for example, strategy games with a random map generator, also tend to have long-lasting appeal. The community-developed mods for many games also contribute to increased replayability and long life for many games. Due to the limits of AI behaviour and the appeal and challenge of playing against friends, multiplayer is also often considered to increase the lifespan of a game. For example, &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; (1999), a comparable simple and old game, is still popular online.

Variety in gameplay is not essential to replayability. Many arcade games, especially from the golden age of arcade games, are completely linear, yet people continue to play these games, even those that have been around for decades. A clear example can be seen in &quot;Tetris&quot;. The gameplay is extremely simple compared to more modern games, yet it is arguably one of the most addictive video games ever made.

Also there is the option to replay a segment of the game. Some notable games, most frequently shooters, permit this. They include &quot;History Civil War: Secret Missions&quot;, &quot;Battlefield&quot; and the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series. These games generally have only a short singleplayer campaign and focus on multiplayer gameplay. Both the inability to replay missions and a lack of multiplayer activities proved damaging to &quot;Mafia II&quot;, a game with high expectations. The critics, most notably IGN, praised the game for its graphics and gameplay, but it fell down because of the lack of side missions and inability to replay missions.

In contrast, some games encourage replaying missions by adding time trial and time attack modes. Other games, such as the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; series have a secondary objective that may be difficult to complete, but necessary for additional elements to be unlocked. For instance, a mission may revolve around killing a specific NPC. The secondary objective may be to kill him in a specific way or to avoid detection. If the player fails to complete the secondary objective on the first attempt, they can revisit the mission later.

Many Japanese RPGs include a New Game+ mode which lets players replay the entire game using select items or abilities from their first play through. This is enabled after the game is finished.

Other times, players may themselves impose new special restrictions on a game to make it more difficult even if the game is linear. Examples include Nuzlocke runs in &quot;Pokémon&quot; or speed runs in a wide variety of games.

<text>Anson Horace “Ace” Carter (born June 6, 1974) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for eight teams from 1996 to 2007, most notably with the Boston Bruins, Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver Canucks. He was last active as a player with HC Lugano in the Swiss Nationalliga A. After retiring from professional hockey, he joined NBC Sports as an analyst and is now currently an analyst for &quot;NHL on TNT&quot; and MSG Network.

Carter is also the founder of Big Up Entertainment, a record label specializing in hip hop music. He attended high school at Agincourt Collegiate Institute and attended Michigan State University where he played at the college level. He is of Bajan descent.

==Early life==

==Playing career==
Carter was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft in the 10th round, 220th overall, after playing AAA level hockey in the Metro Toronto Hockey League.

After completing his AAA hockey career, Carter played one season in the Metro Junior &#x27;A&#x27; Hockey League for the Wexford Raiders, scoring 18 goals and adding 22 assists for 40 points in 42 games, helping the Raiders to a league title as a result of sweeping the Bramalea Blues 4–0 in the championship final. (Incidentally, the Raiders&#x27; head coach was Stan Butler, current special advisor to the owner of the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s North Bay Battalion).

Carter went on to play four years at Michigan State University, earning himself honours on the CCHA First All-Star Team in 1994 and 1995, Second All-Star Team in 1996, as well as the NCAA West Second All-American Team in 1995.

On April 3, 1996, the Nordiques&#x27; successor, the Colorado Avalanche, traded his rights to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft.

Carter made his professional debut in 1996–97, splitting his time with the Capitals and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Portland Pirates, before being traded to the Boston Bruins on March 1, 1997. As part of a blockbuster deal, Carter was sent with Jason Allison, Jim Carey, a third-round selection in the 1997 draft (63rd overall–Lee Goren) and a conditional second-round pick in the 1998 draft to the Bruins in exchange for Adam Oates, Bill Ranford and Rick Tocchet. Both Carter and Tocchet would work together as studio analysts with the &quot;NHL on TNT&quot; nearly a quarter of a century later beginning in 2021.

After spending several seasons with the Bruins, Carter was traded (along with a conditional pick in the 2003 draft, a first- and a second-round pick in the 2001 draft) to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Bill Guerin and a first-round pick in the 2001 draft. In his second season with Edmonton, Carter would record career-highs in assists (32) and points (60). However, on March 11, 2003, he was again traded, to the New York Rangers (along with Aleš Píša) in exchange for Radek Dvořák and Cory Cross.

At the completion of the 2002–03 season, Carter played for Canada in the 2003 World Championships. Over 14 minutes into the first overtime of the gold medal game against Sweden, Carter beat Swedish goaltender Mikael Tellqvist with a wraparound goal. The goal was contested for several minutes before replays confirmed Tellqvist had stopped the puck behind the goal line. It was Canada&#x27;s first World Championship win in five years.

Lasting half a season with the Rangers, Carter was traded back to the Washington Capitals on January 23, 2004, in exchange for Jaromír Jágr. His second go with the Capitals was even more short-lived than his stint with New York, as he was flipped to the Los Angeles Kings for Jared Aulin just over a month later on March 8, 2004.

On August 16, 2005, Carter signed a one-year contract with the Vancouver Canucks as an unrestricted free agent. He played in Vancouver on the second offensive line with twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin, where the trio were known colloquially as the &quot;Brothers Line&quot;. He set a new career-high in goals with 33, leading the team, and earned the Canucks&#x27; Most Exciting Player Award. However, he did not re-sign with the Canucks at the end of the season.

On September 13, 2006, Carter signed a one-year contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets, but was traded once again to the Carolina Hurricanes on February 23, 2007, in exchange for a fifth-round pick in the 2008 NHL draft (Tomas Kubalik).

In September 2007, Carter rejoined the Edmonton Oilers on a try-out basis during their training camp, and played one exhibition game before being released on October 2, 2007. Without an NHL job, on November 5, Carter joined HC Lugano of the Swiss Nationalliga A.

==After his career==
After playing in the NHL for 11 seasons, Carter began his post-hockey career in 2013 with the NBC Sports coverage of NHL regular season, and Stanley Cup Playoffs games. Besides covering the professional ranks, Carter provides game analysis for NBCSN&#x27;s Notre Dame&#x27;s Fighting Irish college hockey. Additionally, Carter also made his debut as part of the 2018 Olympic coverage of the PyeongChang Winter games.

On Canadian television, starting in 2022, Carter was a panelist on Sportsnet&#x27;s &quot;Rogers Monday Night Hockey&quot; NHL broadcasts. He continues to be on Sportsnet NHL coverage in 2024.

Carter founded the Big Up Entertainment record label in March 2005. The label&#x27;s first release was from Richmond, Virginia, natives Main &amp; Merc.

Carter now lives in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2022, Carter become the minority owner of the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL. He is currently seeking to bring an NHL expansion team to Atlanta, with his new group Alpharetta Sports &amp; Entertainment, which would be the city’s third team since the departure of the Atlanta Flames in 1980 and the Atlanta Thrashers in 2011.

<doc id="644241" wikidata="Q7379106" url="?curid=644241" title="Rum Runner (nightclub)">
<text>The Rum Runner was a nightclub on Broad Street, Birmingham. The club operated from 1964 until its demolition in 1987.

== History ==
Originally a casino, the Rum Runner became a more conventional club in the 1970s. One of its first house bands, playing popular cover versions, went on to become the worldwide acclaimed UK Arena band Magnum featuring Bob Catley and Tony Clarkin. They left the club in 1975 to play their own material of melodic rock. Occasionally other live acts played such as Quill and Jigsaw.

Regular late night clientele were Black Sabbath, Roy Wood, Quartz and other notable Birmingham bands calling in after local gigs. Actors and staff from the nearby Central TV Studios also frequented the club.

In the late 1970s, the club was renovated by Paul and Michael Berrow, sons of the club&#x27;s founder, based on ideas drawn from a visit to Studio 54 in New York City.

In 1978, local band Duran Duran brought in a demo tape, and were offered a rehearsal space and jobs around the club: drummer Roger Taylor working as a glass collector, guitarist Andy Taylor cooking and maintaining the interior, bassist John Taylor working as a bouncer, and keyboardist Nick Rhodes DJing. The group became the resident band at the club. After playing their 1983 charity concert at Villa Park, they held the afterparty at the Rum Runner. In 2006 John Taylor and Nick Rhodes released a compilation album entitled &quot;Only After Dark&quot;, featuring their favourite songs from the Rum Runner playlist.

Michael and Paul Berrow were Duran Duran&#x27;s managers, and formed the Tritec Music company (named after the triangular-themed bar inside the club). The label used the Rum Runner office upstairs from the club as its official address.

In developing the club&#x27;s musical identity, the club offered its rooms as free rehearsal space to bands including Dexys Midnight Runners and UB40, with The Beat filming a video for their song &quot;Mirror in the Bathroom&quot; in the club.

The club hosted Mulligan, Martin Degville, other members of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, and fashion designers Kahn &amp; Bell.

In 1987, the building was demolished and the &quot;Soloman Cutler&quot; Wetherspoons pub was subsequently built on the site.

<text>Joseph George Cumming (15 February 1812 – 21 September 1868) was an English geologist and archaeologist. His major works concerned the geology and history of the Isle of Man.

==Biography==
Born at Matlock in Derbyshire where his mother and father ran the Old Bath Hotel at Matlock Bath. Cumming was educated at Oakham School, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, taking the degree of MA, and entering holy orders in 1835. Joseph&#x27;s elder cousin, James was Professor of Chemistry in Cambridge from 1815.

==Isle of Man==
In 1841 he was appointed vice-principal of King William&#x27;s College, Castletown, in the Isle of Man, and this position he held until 1856. During this period his leisure time was devoted to a study of the geology and archaeology of the island. The results were published in:

::&quot;The Isle of Man : its History, Physical, Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Legendary.&quot; published in 1848.

In this book he dealt with the mythical tales, recording the history of the island, especially the geological phenomena. He included the lithological character of the 
island and the disturbances which have produced the subsidence of some geological formations. Within the book he showed the images of manx crosses and afterwards he arranged for casts of these runic crosses to be distributed to museums and organisations in England and Ireland.

In 1856 he became master of King Edward&#x27;s Grammar School at Lichfield in Staffordshire. In 1858, Cumming became warden and professor of classical literature and geology in Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham (which later became Birmingham University), in 1862 rector of Mellis, in Suffolk, and in 1867 vicar of St Johns, Bethnal Green, London.

1857 saw the publication of his book on Rushen Castle again about the Isle of Man. His interest did not wane and in 1861 he was instrumental in forming a committee to send examples of Manx culture and industrial products to the Great Exhibition of 1861.

==Family==
Cumming married Agnes Peckham in 1838. He was survived by his four sons and two daughters. He became a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1846, and he published papers in the journal of that society. He died quite suddenly on 21 September 1868.

<text>Brian Joseph Leetch (born March 3, 1968) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman who played 18 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons with the New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Boston Bruins. He has been called one of the top defensemen in NHL history.

Leetch accumulated many individual honors during his 18-year career. He was a two-time Norris Trophy winner as the NHL&#x27;s best defenseman (1992, 1997) and was the first American-born winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP for his performance during the Rangers&#x27; run to the 1994 Stanley Cup championship. Leetch is one of only six NHL defensemen to score 100 points in a season with his 102-point campaign in 1991–92. He won the Calder Trophy as the NHL Rookie of the Year in 1989 and his 23 goals that season remain an NHL record for rookie defensemen.

Leetch&#x27;s number 2 was retired by the Rangers on January 24, 2008. During the ceremony, longtime teammate Mark Messier referred to Leetch as the single &quot;Greatest Ranger of All Time.&quot; Leetch was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto in 2009, his first year of eligibility. In 2017 Leetch was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Leetch was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, but was raised in Cheshire, Connecticut, where his family moved when he was three months old. He first learned to play hockey at a local ice rink managed by his father, Jack. In high school, he starred in baseball and hockey, first at Cheshire High School, and then at Avon Old Farms. As a sophomore, Leetch&#x27;s 90 mph fastball helped the Cheshire Rams baseball team to a state championship and, as a senior at Avon Old Farms, he set the school record for strikeouts in a game with 19. Hockey, however, was the sport in which he most excelled. As a sophomore at Cheshire, he scored 53 goals and 50 assists, earning All-state honors.

In two seasons with Avon Old Farms, Leetch scored 70 goals and 90 assists in 54 games. These numbers were especially remarkable for a defenseman. NHL scouts were starting to take notice and the New York Rangers chose Leetch as their first-round pick (9th overall) in 1986, making him the first player drafted that year who did not play major junior hockey. Following in the footsteps of his father Jack, Brian enrolled at Boston College in the fall of 1986, and, like his father, would become an All-American defenseman for the Eagles.

===Playing career===
After one season at Boston College, he played for the US Olympic team at the 1988 Games in Calgary, making his NHL debut, eight days later, with the New York Rangers on February 29, 1988, versus St. Louis. Leetch tallied his first NHL point in the game with an assist on Kelly Kisio&#x27;s goal. He finished out the 1987-88 season with 14 points in 17 games. In his first full NHL season (1988-89), Leetch notched 71 points, including a rookie defenseman-record 23 goals, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as well as being selected to the NHL All-Rookie Team.

As the Rangers slowly developed into a championship-caliber team, Leetch won increasing respect from fans for his quiet demeanor and entertaining, offensive-minded play. In 1992 he became the fifth defenseman in history, and the only American defenseman, to record 100 points in a season and was awarded the Norris Trophy. Leetch was the last NHL defenseman to record 100 points for a season until Erik Karlsson reached the mark in . On March 21, 1993, Leetch suffered a broken ankle after slipping on black ice after stepping out of a cab. The injury caused Leetch to miss the rest of the season, prompting a Rangers slump that caused them to miss the playoffs. In 1994 he again matched his career-high of 23 goals in the regular season as the Rangers won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. That year, the Rangers&#x27; 54-year championship drought ended with a seven-game Stanley Cup Finals victory over the Vancouver Canucks. Leetch became the first non-Canadian to be awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, and remained the only American to do so until Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins in 2011. Leetch was the second player in NHL history (after Bobby Orr) to win the Calder Trophy, the Norris Trophy, and the Conn Smythe Trophy in his career. Only Cale Makar has matched this feat since.

Following the Rangers&#x27; Cup win in 1994, Leetch remained a fan favorite and team leader, serving as Captain from 1997–2000 after the departure of Mark Messier to the Vancouver Canucks (he would return the captaincy to Messier upon Messier&#x27;s return to the Rangers in 2000).

In 1996, Leetch captained the victorious American team at the inaugural World Cup of Hockey.
In 1997, he again won the Norris Trophy and the Rangers made a surprise run to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated by the Philadelphia Flyers. The next years, however, were marked by disappointing team performances that saw the Rangers miss the playoffs every year.

====After the Rangers====

In 1998, Leetch was ranked 71st on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. On June 30, 2003, as a pending free agent, his rights were traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Jussi Markkanen and a fourth-round pick in the 2004 draft. The Oilers did not sign him, and he signed a two-year contract to return to the Rangers a month later. After the especially unsuccessful 2004 campaign, the Rangers traded most of their high-priced veterans; Leetch was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs just prior to the trade deadline for prospects Maxim Kondratiev, Jarkko Immonen, a first-round pick in the 2004 draft, which became Kris Chucko (pick was later traded to the Calgary Flames), and a second-round pick in 2005, which became Michael Sauer.

Leetch was set to play the 2004–05 season with the Maple Leafs; however, due to the 2004–05 lockout, the last year of his contract expired, and he became a free agent. Leetch signed a one-year, $4-million contract with the Boston Bruins before the 2005–06 season. Although the Bruins failed to make the postseason, Leetch scored his 1,000th career point as a member of the team.

Throughout the 2006–07 season, Leetch received contract offers from several NHL teams, but accepted none. On May 24, 2007, Leetch officially announced his retirement, bringing his 18-year NHL career to an end.

On September 18, 2007 Leetch was announced as one of the four recipients of the 2007 Lester Patrick Trophy.

On January 24, 2008, the New York Rangers retired Leetch&#x27;s number 2 jersey, joining fellow 1994 Stanley Cup Champion teammates Mark Messier and Mike Richter, as well as Rod Gilbert and Eddie Giacomin in the rafters of Madison Square Garden. On that night, his friend, Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees congratulated Leetch for the honor of having his number retired with a video that ended with Jeter saying &quot;So congratulations, from one number 2 to another.&quot; Leetch also had the honor of announcing during his ceremony that the New York Rangers would retire his friend and former teammate Adam Graves&#x27; number during the 2008–09 season, joining Leetch and the other greats above the Madison Square Gardens ice.

On October 10, 2008, both Leetch and Richter were inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in Denver. Both of them also played for the silver medal-winning U.S. ice hockey team during the 2002 Winter Olympics.

On June 23, 2009, it was announced that Leetch would be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was honored during the November 6–9 induction weekend alongside Steve Yzerman, Brett Hull and Luc Robitaille. The induction made it the third year in a row that a member of the Rangers&#x27; 1994 Stanley Cup team has been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, following Messier in 2007 and Glenn Anderson in 2008, who was also inducted along with one of the on-ice officials when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup, Ray Scapinello.

In August 2015 Leetch became manager of player safety in the NHL&#x27;s Department of Player Safety, leaving after one season.

<text>Johann Martin Schleyer (; 18 July 183116 August 1912) was a German Catholic priest who invented the constructed language Volapük. His official name was &quot;Martin Schleyer&quot;; he added the name &quot;Johann&quot; (in honor of his godfather) unofficially.

== Life and work ==

Schleyer was born in Oberlauda (Baden). According to his own report, the idea of an international language arose out of a conversation he had with one of his parishioners, a semi-literate German peasant whose son had emigrated to America and could no longer be reached by mail because the United States Postal Service could not read the father&#x27;s handwriting.

He was ordained in 1856. From 1867 to 1875, Schleyer served as pastor at Krumbach near Meßkirch. At the end of this time he was jailed for four months for preaching against socialism during the Kulturkampf.

From 1875 to 1885 he was pastor of Ss. Peter and Paul parish in Litzelstetten. He later wrote that the first seven years in Litzelstetten were among the happiest of his life.

At this time he was editor of the magazine , devoted mainly to Catholic poetry. In May 1879 he published an article on Volapük in this magazine. This sketch was followed by a full-length book in 1880. The language spread widely and new clubs sprung all over Europe. After 1885 Schleyer had to retire from his pastoral duties due to ill health, though he was still involved in the Volapük movement until it fell apart a few years later.

In 1894 Pope Leo XIII made him a papal prelate.

Schleyer died in Konstanz in 1912.

== Remembrance ==
A campaign to beatify him was started in June 2001, based in his home parish of Litzelstetten. The high school Martin-Schleyer-Gymnasium Lauda-Königshofen in Lauda is named for him.

<doc id="644255" wikidata="Q6389039" url="?curid=644255" title="Kendrick School">
<text>Kendrick School is a selective girls&#x27; grammar school situated in the centre of Reading, Berkshire, UK. In February 2011, Kendrick became an Academy.

==History==

The school is named after John Kendrick, a Reading cloth merchant who died in 1624. John Kendrick left the then substantial charitable bequest of £12,500 to the towns of Reading and Newbury to provide employment and education for the poor. Initially this was used to provide a house of industry, or workhouse, called &quot;The Oracle&quot;, a name that was revived for the Oracle shopping mall which now occupies the site.

In later years the funds left by Kendrick were mismanaged and subject to legal challenge. In the 1870s this was resolved, and the remaining bequest used to found Kendrick Girls&#x27; School, along with the Kendrick Boys&#x27; School that was later to merge with Reading School. An oil painting of John Kendrick, rescued from the Oracle workhouse, still hangs in the hall at Kendrick School. The caption reads &quot;John Kendrick, founder of this workhouse&quot;.

The school in its current form was founded in 1877 and occupied Watlington House in Watlington Street for the first 50 years of its life. In 1927, the school moved to its current site, situated on the corner of Sidmouth Street and London Road. The building is a Grade II listed building. The school was originally known as &quot;Kendrick Girls&#x27; School&quot; but is now called &quot;Kendrick School&quot;.

The current Headmistress is Christine Kattirtzi. She replaced Marsha Elms at the end of the Spring Term, 2012.

==Academic performance==
Kendrick School has an outstanding Ofsted rating, and has a progress 8 score &quot;well above national average&quot;.
Pupils are selected on the basis of academic ability via an admissions test at age 11 (although entry is possible in other years too). The school was among the top five grammar schools in the UK based on GCSE performance in 2018, and in 2019.

In July 2011, Kendrick School was identified by the Sutton Trust as the fifth highest state school for proportion of higher education applicants accepted at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The report found that 15.2% of pupils were accepted to Oxbridge and 79.4% were accepted to the highly selective Sutton Trust 30 universities over the previous three years.
A 2016 report also ranked Kendrick among the top 10 state schools in Oxbridge admissions. As a state-funded school, there are no fees; as a result, it is severely over-subscribed, with over ten applicants per place.

==House System==
The Kendrick House system consists of three houses: Cedars, Sidmouth and Palmer House. Each house is assigned a colour and animal, as follows: Cedars — blue seal (Cedars seals), Sidmouth — yellow squid (Sidmouth squidmouth) and Palmer — green llama (Palmer llama).

<text>Lviv Polytechnic National University () is a public university in Lviv, Ukraine, founded in 1816. According to the Times Higher Education, as of 2024, it ranks first as a technical institution of higher education and second among all institutions of higher education after Sumy State University in Ukraine. Lviv Polytechnic is also the largest educational institution in Ukraine by the number of students and one of the largest by the number of faculties and departments.

==History==
The history of the Lviv Polytechnic National University begins during the Austrian Empire, and extends through the Second Polish Republic, the Nazi German Occupation, the Soviet Union, and into independent Ukraine.

On 7 March 1816, the Imperial-Royal Real School was opened in Lemberg (Lviv). A technical school was established with the help of the newly introduced local industrial tax. In the curricula of the Imperial-Royal School, the main focus was assigned to the subjects of the natural-mathematical cycle, drawing, drawing and the study of new modern languages. The educational process was based on German educational programs that were adapted to local requirements. The newly created School was housed in a beautiful building at number 20 on the then-current Piekarska Street (now Virmenska).

In 1825, according to the Royal Decree of the Austrian Emperor Franz I, the three-level Imperial-Royal Real School was reorganised into the Imperial-Royal School of Technical Sciences and Trade in Lviv.

In 1835, the School of Technical Sciences and Trade turned into the Imperial-Royal Real-Trade Academy in Lviv. Here in 1841 the technical faculty was opened.

In 1844, in the house of Darowski, on the present Armenian street, 2, the Imperial-Royal Technical Academy was opened in Lviv with technical and trade departments (faculties). It was one of the first academic technical schools in Europe and the first in Ukraine. In 1877, at the start of a new academic year, under the leadership of the new rector Julian Zachariewicz, construction began of a new building to the academy (in the present Stepan Bandera street). Julian Zachariewicz was also an accomplished architect, and designed this building, based on the 1820s Technical University in Vienna, and the chemical laboratory.

At the same time, the academy was renamed &quot;Polytechnic School&quot; and included in the academic schools of the Austro-Hungarian Empire .

On 10 July 1912, Maria Sklodowska-Curie delivered a lecture at the Lviv Polytechnic School, and on the same day, she received the title of Honorary Doctor of Technical Sciences. Her name was commemorated on the honorary board of doctors honoris causa of Lviv Polytechnic.

Since 1921 the institution has been called &quot;Politechnika Lwowska&quot;, and since 1939 - Lviv Polytechnic Institute.

In June 1993, one year before the celebration of its 150th anniversary, the Lviv Polytechnic Institute received the highest - the fourth - the level of accreditation, the status of the university and the name of the &quot;State University &quot;Lviv Polytechnic&quot;&quot; . In 2000 the Polytechnic received the status of a national university.

On 8 July 2009, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, at its meeting, granted the National University &quot;Lviv Polytechnic&quot; the status of a self-governing research national higher educational institution.

In October 2017, the Tech StartUp School Business Innovation Center officially opened at Lviv Polytechnic National University with the aim of facilitating startups and innovations as well as providing students with business mentoring programs. 

In May 2018 the IoT lab designed for students was established in the university with the support of Lviv IT Cluster organization.

<text>Paolo Mantegazza (; 31 October 1831 – 28 August 1910) was an Italian neurologist, physiologist, and anthropologist, known for his experimental investigation of coca leaves and its effects on the human psyche. He was also an author of fiction.

==Life==

Mantegazza was born in Monza on 31 October 1831. After spending his student days at the universities of Pisa and Milan, he gained his M.D. degree at the University of Pavia in 1854. After travelling in Europe, India and the Americas, he practised as a doctor in Argentina and Paraguay. He returned to Italy in 1858 he was appointed surgeon at Milan Hospital and professor of general pathology at the University of Pavia. In 1870, he was nominated professor of anthropology at the Istituto di Studi Superiori in Florence. Here, he founded the first Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology in Italy, and later the Italian Anthropological Society. 

From 1865 to 1876, he was deputy for Monza in the Parliament of Italy, and was subsequently elected to the Italian Senate. He became the object of fierce attacks because of the extent to which he practised vivisection. 

In 1879, Mantegazza travelled to Norway with his colleague Stephan Sommier on a quest to collect &quot;anthropological facts&quot; about the Sámi. He gathered three types of information: cultural items, anthropometric measurements, and photographs. The last category featured images he and Sommier had created as well as photos he had taken along the way. All of them were returned to Florence, where Mantegazza was the director of the anthropological museum.

Mantegazza was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895.

In 1897, he published his novel &quot;The Year 3000: A Dream;&quot; through this work he projected that future citizens would have air conditioning, renewable electricity, credit cards, and virtual-reality entertainment, as well as a massive war in Europe, which would be followed by peace, integration, and a unified currency.

During a time when the popular and official science and culture in Italy were still influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, Mantegazza was a staunch liberal and defended the ideas of Darwinism in anthropology, his research having helped to establish it as the &quot;natural history of man&quot;. He also maintained a correspondence with Charles Darwin from 1868 to 1875. 

Mantegazza&#x27;s natural history, however, must be considered to be from a racial or social Darwinist perspective, evident in his &quot;Morphological Tree of Human Races&quot;. This tree maps three principles: a single European meta-narrative controls all of the world&#x27;s many cultures; human history imagined as progressive, with the European human as the pinnacle of progress and development; and lastly, a ranking of different races onto a hierarchical structure. The hierarchy was structured similarly to a tree, with the Aryan race as the topmost branch, followed by Polynesians, Semites, Japanese, and moving downward to the bottom-most branch, the &quot;Negritos.&quot; Mantegazza also designed an &quot;Aesthetic Tree of the Human Race&quot; with similar results.

Mantegazza believed drugs and certain foods would change humankind in the future, and defended the experimental investigation and use of cocaine as one of these miracle drugs. When Mantegazza returned from South America, where he had witnessed the use of coca by indigenous people, he was able to chew a regular amount of coca leaves and then tested them on himself in 1859. Afterward, he wrote a paper titled &quot;Sulle Virtù Igieniche e Medicinali della Coca e sugli Alimenti Nervosi in Generale&quot; (&quot;On the hygienic and medicinal properties of coca and on nervous nourishment in general&quot;). He noted enthusiastically the powerful stimulating effect of cocaine in coca leaves on cognition:

&quot;&quot;... I sneered at the poor mortals condemned to live in this valley of tears while I, carried on the wings of two leaves of coca, went flying through the spaces of 77,438 words, each more splendid than the one before...An hour later, I was sufficiently calm to write these words in a steady hand: God is unjust because he made man incapable of sustaining the effect of coca all life long. I would rather have a life span of ten years with coca than one of 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 centuries without coca.&quot; &quot;

Mantegazza died at San Terenzo (La Spezia) on 28 August 1910.

==Works==

Mantegazza&#x27;s published works also included: 
* &quot;Fisiologia del Dolore&quot; (Physiology of Pain, 1880);
* &quot;Fisiologia dell&#x27;Amore&quot; (Physiology of Love, 1896); 
* &quot;Elementi d&#x27;igiene&quot; (Elements of Hygiene, 1875);
* &quot;Fisonomia e Mimica&quot; (Physiognomy and Mimics, 1883); 
* &quot;Gli Amori degli Uomini&quot; (The Sexual Relations of Mankind, 1885);
* &quot;Fisiologia dell&#x27;odio&quot;, (Physiology of Hate, 1889); 
* &quot;Fisiologia della Donna&quot; (Physiology of Women, 1893). 

His philosophical and social views were published in a 1,200-page volume in 1871, titled &quot;Quadri della Natura Umana. Feste ed Ebbrezze&quot; (&quot;Pictures of Human Nature. Feasts and Inebriations&quot;). Many consider this opus his masterpiece.

As a fiction writer, Mantegazza was very original. He wrote a romance on the marriage between people with disease, &quot; Un Giorno a Madera&quot; (1876), which made quite a sensation. Less well known is his science fiction and futuristic romance &quot;L&#x27;Anno 3000&quot; (The Year 3000, written in 1897).

He also wrote the novel &quot;Testa&quot; (&quot;Head&quot;, 1887), a sequel of renowned book Heart, by his friend Edmondo de Amicis. The novel tells the story of Enrico in his teenager years.

<text>Adolphe Napoléon Didron (1806–1867) was a French art historian and archaeologist.

==Biography==
Adolphe Napoléon Didron was born in Hautvillers on 13 March 1806. He began his education as a student of law. He then completed his early studies at the preparatory seminaries of Meaux and Reims.

He became a professor of history in Paris in 1826, and devoted his leisure hours to following courses of law, medicine, etc. In 1830, he began, on the advice of Victor Hugo, a study of the Christian archaeology of the Middle Ages. After visiting and examining the principal churches, first of Normandy, then of central and southern France, he was on his return in 1835 appointed by Guizot secretary to the Historical Committee of Arts and Monuments; and in the following years he delivered several courses of lectures on Christian iconography at the Bibliothèque Royale.

In 1839, he visited Greece for the purpose of examining the art of the Eastern Church, both in its buildings and its manuscripts. In 1844, he originated the &quot;Annales archéologiques&quot;, a periodical devoted to his favorite subject, which he edited until his death. In 1845 he established at Paris a special archaeological press, and at the same time a stained glass factory. In the same year he was admitted to the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

His most important work is the &quot;Iconographie chrétienne&quot;, of which, however, the first portion only, &quot;Histoire de Dieu&quot;, was published, in 1843. It was translated into English by E. J. Millington. Among his other works may be mentioned the introduction and comments to &quot;Manuel d&#x27;iconographie chrétienne grecque et latine&quot; (by Dionysios of Fourna, translated by Paul Durand), published in 1845, the &quot;Iconographie des chapiteaux du palais ducal de Venise&quot; of 1857, and the &quot;Manuel des objets de bronze et d&#x27;orfèvrerie&quot;, published in 1859.

He died on 13 November 1867.
