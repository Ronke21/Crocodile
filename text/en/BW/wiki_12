<text>Omaha&#x27;s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is a zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. In August 2014, TripAdvisor rated it the &quot;world&#x27;s best zoo&quot;, ahead of the San Diego Zoo and Loro Parque, based on an algorithmic assimilation of millions of reviews for 275 major zoos worldwide.

The zoo is known for its leadership in animal conservation and research. Evolving from the public Riverview Park Zoo established in 1894, today the zoo includes several notable exhibits. &quot;Kingdoms of the Night&quot; is the world&#x27;s largest nocturnal exhibit and indoor swamp, the &quot;Lied Jungle&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s largest indoor rainforests, and the &quot;Desert Dome&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s largest indoor deserts, as well as the largest glazed geodesic dome.

The zoo&#x27;s mission includes four pillars—conservation, research, recreation, and education—which are represented by the four squares in the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;omahazoo.com/information&quot;&gt;&quot;Information&quot; , Omaha&#x27;s Henry Doorly Zoo. Retrieved 5/8/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1894, the first animals were exhibited here under the name Riverview Park Zoo. By 1898, the collection had grown to over 120 animals. The Omaha Zoological Society was founded in 1952 to organize the long-term efforts of the zoo. The name was changed to Omaha&#x27;s Henry Doorly Zoo &amp; Aquarium in 1963, after a $750,000 donation from Margaret Hitchcock Doorly, given with the stipulation that the zoo be renamed in memory of her late husband. Henry Doorly had an influential career the chairman of the World Publishing Company. In addition to the World Publishing Company, the zoo soon connected with another notable Omaha business: Union Pacific. Union Pacific helped the zoo lay down of track in 1968 and the inaugural run of the Omaha Zoo Railroad was made on July 22, 1968.

The zoo has two rides that circumnavigate the property (tram and train): a carousel and the Skyfari, an aerial tram which opened in 2009 and takes visitors from the Butterfly and Insect Pavilion to the lion viewing exhibit.

The zoo is adjacent to the former site of Rosenblatt Stadium. In 2011, the zoo began developing the land at the stadium to become the new parking area and visitor center, leaving a small memorial at the location of home plate. Rosenblatt was replaced by the Charles Schwab Field Omaha downtown.

* Butterfly Conservatory: The area features -high glass sidewalls to allow the maximum amount of light inside the exhibit. Natural light, large trees, rocks, and water elements simulate a natural habitat and help stimulate natural butterfly behaviors.
* Conservation Promenade: Located in the Butterfly Conservatory, the promenade winds past waterfalls and over streams, through vegetation, and loops around the giant Amazon water lily pool. The pool features a tree supporting a floating walkway through the roots for a close view of the giant South American water lilies. Species of butterflies and moths include the blue Morpho, zebra longwing, and painted ladies. Microhabitats are displayed along the Conservation Promenade featuring endangered amphibians the Zoo is currently working with in response to the global amphibian crisis. Visitors must stop in a mirrored room to check for butterflies before exiting.
* Chrysalis Hatching Room: A area where butterflies and moths in their chrysalis or cocoon stage will be brought in from all over the world. Inside, they are carefully hung in hatching chambers where visitors can watch them complete their metamorphosis. The entry hallway leading into the insect wing contains several displays, such as a locust colony and a Halloween moon crab, along with interactive learning opportunities.
* Insect Zoo: This area has a high glass sidewall on top of a solid wall to allow more intensive exhibit work. Individual micro-habitats are home to ants, spiders, scorpions, walking sticks, mantids, centipedes, roaches, beetles and other animals. In the center of this room, two bird exhibits house other exotic species such as tropical hummingbirds.
* Lower Level: Features two rooms, approximately , used for rearing butterflies and culturing insect colonies. Another room is used to maintain plants that are being rotated through the butterfly display. A frog breeding and rearing facility houses the most threatened amphibians. The rooms can be viewed through windows from the Giraffe Observation Walk that circles the building and allow Zoo visitors a look behind the scenes. This same path has numerous native butterfly gardens.

The Cat Complex was awarded the &quot;Edward H. Bean Award&quot; (1994) for tiger husbandry by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
Omaha&#x27;s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is known worldwide for its work in the field of artificial insemination of large cats. The zoo&#x27;s 15-year master plan, composed in 2010, called for the elimination of the Cat Complex along with the overhauling of several other exhibits. Going forward, animals at the zoo are grouped not by their genetic relatives, but by regions of the world. The exhibit was closed permanently in 2019 and demolished in 2022 as the cats located in the Cat Complex were relocated to new exhibits in the African Grasslands and Asian Highlands, or at other zoos and sanctuaries.

The complex contained nine species from the family Felidae:
===Durham Family Bear Canyon===

===Red Barn Park===
The Red Barn Park was a petting zoo that opened in 1966. It included numerous domesticated animals including goats and cattle and was particularly noteworthy because of the large red barn that could be found in the area. It was demolished in 2018 and replaced with the Glacier Bay Landing area which opened in the spring of 2019. Many of the animals found in the exhibit were transferred to the Children&#x27;s Adventure Trails.

==Conservation==
===Amphibian Conservation Area===
The zoo&#x27;s Amphibian Conservation Area opened following the 2005 release of the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Global Amphibian Assessment, as in-depth status report on the world&#x27;s 8,000-plus known frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians, which declared amphibians as the most significantly threatened group of vertebrates in the world. The mission of the behind-the-scenes area, which is not accessible to visitors, is to address wild amphibian decline by continually advancing conservation efforts through evolving welfare, reproduction, collaboration, and reintroduction.

The 3,800 square-foot facility features 13 temperature-controlled rooms, a specialized wastewater treatment system, insect culturing area and thorough disinfection protocols to ensure the entire space remains pathogen-free. With only three full-time keepers, the Amphibian Conservation Area has supported the release of more than 121,000 amphibians to date.

====Recovery Program Impact====

* Status: Ground-breaking construction projects, day-to-day exhibit maintenance, weather events and other unforeseen circumstances can put amphibians native to the area in harm&#x27;s way. After discovering a population of American toads living on grounds, zoo staff routinely survey the entire property in search of these and other amphibian species, sometimes in the early stages of life, who need care or need to be relocated to a safer environment to thrive.
* Species involved: Include but not limited to: American toad, Woodhouse toad, the chorus frog, plains leopard frog, and eastern tiger salamander.
* Recovery program involvement: 2012 – Present
* Contribution to the species: 3,480 individuals released

==Research==
The Bill and Berniece Grewcock Center for Conservation and Research is a world-class research center at the zoo. The center has discovered several new species. The world&#x27;s first &quot;in vitro&quot;-fertilized (IVF, &quot;test-tube&quot;) gorilla resides at the zoo. The world&#x27;s first artificially inseminated tiger was born in Omaha in 1991, followed by the world&#x27;s first artificially inseminated gaur. The original facility was constructed in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;omahazoo/research&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, it underwent a $6 million expansion which brings the total space to .

The research center focuses on six areas:
* Education and technology transfer
* Conservation medicine
* Molecular genetics
* Reproductive physiology
* Horticulture
* Nutrition

===Mouse lemurs===
A study led by Edward Louis, a conservation geneticist at the zoo, identified three new mouse lemurs (Simmons&#x27; mouse lemur, Mittermeier&#x27;s mouse lemur, and Jolly&#x27;s mouse lemur) with the first named after Lee Simmons, the zoo&#x27;s director.

==Rides and transportation==
===Railroad===

The Omaha Zoo Railroad is a , narrow gauge train that loops through the zoo.
The railroad began operations on July 22, 1968, after the track was laid down by the Union Pacific railroad. The train operates with one of two oil-powered steam locomotives. Riva is about twice as powerful as the #119 (although it is almost 80 years older) and is regularly used on weekends when more visitors are present. The #119 is the original locomotive for the zoo. A new diesel locomotive arrived in September 2008. This diesel is a 2-axle Plymouth locomotive and is used for switching operations of the passenger cars and other railroad-related projects.

===Tram===
The tram is a trackless tram that drives on the walkway paths around the zoo.
It has four stops:
* By the Desert Dome (top of the hill)
* Between the elephant/zebra yard and pygmy goat corral
* By the playground near the sea lions
* Between the carousel and Alaskan Adventure splashpad

===Skyfari===
Omaha&#x27;s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium opened the Skyfari in 2009. It is an aerial tram that runs from one stop at the Butterfly and Insect Pavilion to the lion platform. It goes over the African veldt (ostriches and giraffes), cheetahs, the railroad tracks, the Garden of the Senses, the koi lagoon, and the lions.

===Carousel===
A carousel is available on which visitors can ride handcrafted recreations of wild animals. In 2021, it was moved to the Glacier Bay area which has been recently renovated.

==Educational programs==

Major zoo educational programs include on-site preschool and high school courses, internships, and volunteer work. Other programs include field trips, guided tours, educator workshops, and ambassador animal presentations. Other educational programming includes overnight campouts, scouting events, summer camps, birthday parties, and on-site speakers.

<text>Keta is a coastal town in the Volta Region of Ghana. It is the capital of the Keta Municipal District.

Keta is the sixty-first most populous settlement in Ghana in terms of population, with a population of 23,207. Parts of the town were devastated by sea erosion between the 1960s and 1980s. Keta is mentioned in Maya Angelou&#x27;s &quot;All God&#x27;s Children Need Traveling Shoes&quot;.

==History==
Keta was settled by the Anlo Ewe, a sub-group of the Ewe people who, in the 17th century, migrated to the area from Ketu, in Benin via Adja Tado and Notsie in Togo.

Keta was an important trading post between the 14th and the late 20th centuries. The town attracted the interest of the Danish, because they felt they could establish a base here without interference from rival European nations. Their first initiative was to place a factory at Keta to sell alcohol.

In 1792, a war was instigated by the Danes between Anloga and Keta. With the aid of cannon from the fort and ships anchored at sea nearby, Keta was razed to the ground. Majority of the original people then migrated across the lagoon to Klikor to establish the Somey State with Agbozume as its capital. Keta was then repopulated with people from other areas of the surrounding communities.

Faced with the threat of war between Peki and an alliance of the Ashanti and the Akwamu, the North German Missionary Society (also known as the Bremen Missionaries) moved the focus of their activities from Peki to Keta. Their missionaries, Dauble and Plessing, landed at nearby Dzelukofe on September 2, 1853.

Historically Keta was also known as &quot;Quittah&quot; or Agudzeawo (Easterners in old Ewe) and was assigned B27 as a postal mark.

From 1874 Hausa Constabulary were based at Keta, and soon there grew to be a community of Hausa traders in the town.

The author, and then colonial Civil Servant, Dr. R. Austin Freeman served as a medical officer (Assistant Surgeon) here in 1887 during which an epidemic of black water fever killed forty per cent of the European population.

Etymology: Ewe language- Ke:ta - 
Head of the sand

==Ecology==
In 1784, Fort Prinzenstein, like most slave trade forts, was built by the sea&#x27;s edge. However the sea had retreated by about 600 ft by 1907. Since then Keta has been subject to sustained erosion. The Bremen Factory and Coconut plantation, which were close to the high water mark in 1907, had been swept away by the sea by 1924. The erosion has now advanced as far as Queen Street and started to wear away the Fort.

Close to Keta is the famous town of Woe, known for the notable lighthouse called Cape St. Paul Lighthouse on the beach that is believed to guide ships away from a mythical massive underwater mountain. This lighthouse is also thought to be the oldest in Ghana.

==Keta Lagoon==

Keta Lagoon is the largest lagoon in Ghana with a water area of 300 km2. This is located in a larger wetlands protected area of 1200 km2. It is a stopping point for a large number of migratory birds and provides a breeding ground for sea turtles.
The Keta Lagoon is known for its immense quantity of salt.

==Festival==
Keta Sometutuza Festival&quot;hogbetsotso za&quot;

Etymology

Keta: (Ewe language ). Head/top of the sand.
These words were uttered by Torgbui Wenya,the founder of Anlo State when he sighted the sand dunes at the sea shore. Wenya had separated from his kinsmen in nearby Wheta Atiteti to establish his own settlement at Anloga.
Historically, the people of Keta were also known as Agudzeawo - meaning Easterners because they are east of Anloga.

==Oil==
Oil has been found at the Keta Basin. However, experts are against the exploitation because it will be on land which lead to the destruction of land and lives, as well as some sources of livelihood.

== Education ==
The city can boast of notably finest schools in the Volta Region.

<doc id="636062" wikidata="Q13357" url="?curid=636062" title="Meänkieli">
<text> (literally &#x27;our language&#x27;), or Tornedalian is a Finnic language or a group of distinct Finnish dialects spoken in the northernmost part of Sweden along the valley of the Torne River. Meänkieli is recognized in Sweden as one of the country&#x27;s five minority languages and is treated as a distinct language from Finnish, however its status as an independent Finnic language is sometimes disputed due to its mutual intelligibility with Finnish. According to the National Association of Swedish Tornedalians, 70,000 individuals are able to understand Meänkieli, at least to some level. 

Meänkieli is especially similar to the Kven language and the Finnish dialects spoken on the Finnish side of the border and is strongly mutually intelligible with them, although Meänkieli contains strong influences from Swedish and has conserved some archaic features which even the Northern Finnish dialects have lost. 

Meänkieli is distinguished from Standard Finnish by the absence of 19th- and 20th-century developments in Finnish.

== History ==
Before 1809, all of what is today Finland was an integral part of Sweden. The language border went west of the Torne Valley area, so the upper section of today&#x27;s Sweden (about 10% by area), was historically Finnish speaking (just like most areas along the eastern coast of the southern part of Gulf of Bothnia, areas that were ceded to Russia and are part of modern Finland, were historically Swedish speaking, and to a large extent still are). The area where Meänkieli is spoken that is now northern Sweden (apart from the linguistically Sami and Swedish parts of this geographical area), formed a dialect continuum within the Realm of Sweden. Since the area east of Torne River was ceded to Russia in 1809, the language spoken on the western side of it developed in partial isolation from standard Finnish. In 1826, the state Church of Sweden appointed the priest and amateur botanist Lars Levi Laestadius to be the Vicar over the Karesuando parish, which is situated along the Muonio River north of the Arctic Circle on the border of Finland in Swedish Lapland.

In the 1880s, the Swedish state decided that all citizens of the country should speak Swedish. Part of the reason was military; people close to the border speaking the language of the neighbouring country rather than the major language in their own country might not be trusted in case of war. Another reason was that Finns (primarily eastern Finns) were sometimes regarded as being of another &quot;race.&quot; An opinion of that period, as reflected in contemporary fiction, was that the Sami and the Finnish populations belonged &quot;more closely to Russia than to Scandinavia&quot;. Beginning around this time, the schools in the area only taught in Swedish, and children were forbidden under penalty of physical punishment from speaking their own language at school even during class breaks. Native Finnish speakers were prevented by the authorities from learning Standard Finnish as a school subject for decades, which resulted in the survival of the language only in oral form.

When minority languages first became taught in Swedish schools, Meänkieli was still classified by Sweden as a form of Finnish and children who spoke it natively were taught the standard Finnish literary language in school instead of their more native Tornedalian variant, causing the students to become demotivated. However, in 1977 some schools began to make materials specifically designed for speakers of Meänkieli which did not use standard Finnish. This was also the first time the term &quot;Meänkieli&quot; was applied to the form of speech, which was called &quot;Tornedalian Finnish&quot; before.

=== Meänkieli today ===
On April 1, 2000, Meänkieli became one of the now five nationally recognized minority languages of Sweden, which means it can be used for some communication with local and regional authorities in the communities along the Finnish border. Its minority language status applies in designated local communities and areas, not throughout Sweden.

Few people today speak Meänkieli as their only language, with speakers usually knowing Swedish and often standard Finnish as well. Estimates of how many people speak Meänkieli vary from 30,000 to 70,000, of whom most live in Norrbotten. Many people in the northern parts of Sweden understand some Meänkieli, but fewer people speak it regularly. People with Meänkieli roots are often referred to as Tornedalians although the Finnish-speaking part of Norrbotten is a far larger area than the Torne River Valley; judging by the names of towns and places, the Finnish-speaking part of Norrbotten stretches as far west as the town of Gällivare.

Today Meänkieli is declining. Few young people speak Meänkieli as part of daily life though many have passive knowledge of the language from family use, and it is not uncommon for younger people from Meänkieli-speaking families to be more familiar with standard Finnish, for which literature and courses are much more readily available. The language is taught at Stockholm University, Luleå University of Technology, Umeå University, and Babeș-Boylai University in Romania. In 2020, Oulu University began teaching translators in Meänkieli and Kven. Bengt Pohjanen is a trilingual author from the Torne Valley. In 1985 he wrote the first Meänkieli novel, . He has also written several novels, dramas, grammar books, songs and films in Meänkieli.

The author Mikael Niemi&#x27;s novels and a film based on one of his books in Swedish have improved awareness of this minority among Swedes. Since the 1980s, people who speak Meänkieli have become more aware of the importance of the language as a marker of identity. Today there are grammar books, a Bible translation, drama performances, and there are some TV programmes in Meänkieli. 

On radio, programmes in Meänkieli are broadcast regularly from regional station P4 Norrbotten (as well as local station P6 in Stockholm) on Mondays to Thursdays between 17:10 and 18:00, while on Sundays further programmes are carried by P6 between 8:34 and 10:00 (also on P2 nationwide from 8:34 to 9:00). All of these programmes are also available via the Internet.

== Status as a language ==
Individuals who agree with the classification of Meänkieli as a separate language generally do so for historical, political and sociological reasons, usually pointing to its separate history, cultural meaning, official status, and its standardised written language that is distinct from standard Finnish. However, on pure linguistic grounds, Meänkieli may be classified as a group of Northern Peräpohjola dialects of Finnish. Although the creation of the 1809 border has moved Meänkieli into its own direction by increasing Swedish influences and keeping some archaic features, Meänkieli is still very comprehensible for speakers of Finnish, especially due to the fact that Swedish is taught as a mandatory subject in Finland, causing the heavy Swedish influence in Meänkieli to not cause as many problems for comprehension. However, according to Harri Mantila (a professor at the University of Oulu), the independent status of Meänkieli is important to many of its speakers as it has increased its linguistic prestige which has been historically very low due to the process of Swedification, thus helping to create a stronger cultural identity for the Tornedalians.

== Dialects ==
In Sweden, Meänkieli consists of three dialect subgroups, the Torne Valley dialects (spoken in Pajala, Övertorneå, Haparanda and parts of Kiruna), Lannankieli (spoken in Kiruna and Jukkasjärvi) and the Gällivare dialects (spoken around Gällivare), which all descend from the larger Peräpohjola dialect group. The Torne Valley dialects are the most major variant group of Meänkieli, and the written standard language of Meänkieli is primarily derived from the Torne Valley dialects spoken in Pajala and Övertorneå. However, the Lannankieli and Gällivare variants are more severely endangered. All three dialectgroups are mutually intelligible with each other, however they contain some lexical differences.

== Geographical distribution ==
Meänkieli has an official status in: Pajala, Övertorneå, Haparanda, Gällivare, Luleå, Kalix, Kiruna, Umeå and Stockholm. Meänkieli has also been historically spoken in Piteå, Boden, Älvsbyn and northeastern Jokkmokk municipality.

== Grammar ==
The grammar of Meänkieli is very similar to Finnish, with some variations such as the aspiration of consonants before long vowels. Meänkieli is an agglutinative language with fifteen noun cases. It contains consonant gradation and vowel harmony, just like Finnish. It contains four verb tenses, which are the present, imperfect, perfect and the pluperfect. It does not have a separate tense for future events.

== Differences between standard Finnish and Meänkieli ==
1) There exists often either the omission of the &quot;d&quot; sound (in native words) or its replacement with &quot;t&quot; (in loanwords):

* &quot;tehä&quot; &#x27;to do&#x27; (Finnish: tehdä)
* &quot;tynamiitti&quot; &#x27;dynamite&#x27; (Finnish: dynamiitti)
* &quot;syyä&quot; &#x27;to eat&#x27; (Finnish: syödä)
* &quot;meän&quot; &#x27;our&#x27; (Finnish: meidän)
* &quot;heän&quot; &#x27;their&#x27; (Finnish: heidän)
* &quot;teän&quot; &#x27;your&#x27; (Finnish: teidän)
* &quot;soan&quot; &#x27;of the war (Finnish: sodan)

2) In certain environments, gemination (doubling of consonants) occurs, which differs from standard Finnish:

Instead of &quot;ts&quot; clusters, there is &quot;tt&quot; (similar to western Finnish dialects):

* &quot;mettä&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27; (Finnish: metsä)
* &quot;kattoa&quot; &#x27;to look&#x27; (Finnish: katsoa)

Some consonant clusters have assimilated into geminates:

&quot;jokka&quot; &#x27;who&#x27; (Finnish: jotka)

Meänkieli often has the geminate &quot;vv&quot;:

* &quot;savvu&quot; &#x27;smoke&#x27; (Finnish: savu)
* &quot;avvain&quot; &#x27;key&#x27; (Finnish: avain)

3) Verb conjugation endings: -mma ~ -mmä, -tta ~ -ttä, -pi

* &quot;menemmä&quot; &#x27;we go&#x27; (&#x27;menemme&#x27; in Finnish)
* &quot;tuletta&quot; &#x27;you come&#x27; (&#x27;tulette&#x27; in Finnish)
* &quot;ostaapi&quot; &#x27;buys&#x27; (&#x27;ostaa&#x27; in Finnish)
* &quot;syövä&quot; &#x27;they eat&#x27; (&#x27;syövät&#x27; in Finnish)

4) Past participle:

The Finnish &quot;syönyt&quot; form corresponds to &quot;syönny&quot; in Meänkieli (not present in all dialects).

5) In certain loanwords, Meänkieli has the sound &quot;y&quot; under the influence of Swedish, while Finnish uses the sound &quot;u&quot;:

* &quot;kyltyyri&quot; = &#x27;culture&#x27; (Finnish: kulttuuri)
* &quot;mysiikki&quot; = &#x27;music&#x27; (Finnish: musiikki)
* &quot;resyrssi&quot; = &#x27;resource&#x27; (Finnish: resurssi)

6) In loanwords, Meänkieli has preserved the &quot;f&quot; sound, whereas in Finnish it has often become &quot;v&quot;:

* &quot;färi&quot; &#x27;color&#x27; (Finnish: väri)
* &quot;fankila&quot; &#x27;prison&#x27; (Finnish: vankila)
* &quot;fati&quot; &#x27;bowl&#x27; (Finnish: vati)
* &quot;fiuletti&quot; &#x27;violet&#x27; (Finnish: violetti)

* &quot;vukaali&quot; &#x27;vowel&#x27; (Finnish: vokaali)
* &quot;pusitiivinen&quot; &#x27;positive&#x27; (Finnish: positiivinen)

8) The verb &quot;olla&quot; (to be) is sometimes combined with personal pronouns in the spoken form of Meänkieli:

* &quot;Molen&quot; = I am (Finnish: minä olen)
* &quot;Solet&quot; = you are (Finnish: sinä olet)
* &quot;Son&quot; = it is, he/she is (Finnish: hän on/se on)
* &quot;Sole&quot; = it is not (Finnish: se ei ole)
* &quot;Molema&quot; = we are (Finnish: me olemme)
* &quot;Toletta&quot; = you (plural) are (Finnish: te olette)
* &quot;Non/Noova/Hoova&quot; = they are (Finnish: he ovat)

10) Personal pronouns.

Personal pronouns in Meänkieli somewhat differ from those used in standard Finnish:

11) Meänkieli often uses the &quot;š&quot; sound in loanwords due to Swedish influence.

* šinkka = ham
* informašuuni = information
* lekitimašuuni = personal identification

=== Some Meänkieli words not used in standard Finnish ===

Meänkieli also contains many words which have different meanings in Finnish and Meänkieli, yet sound similar. An example is the word &quot;pyörtyä&quot;, which means &#x27;to get lost&#x27; in Meänkieli, but it refers to fainting in Finnish.

<text>The Emperor of Mexico () was the head of state and head of government
of Mexico on two non-consecutive occasions during the 19th century.

With the Mexican Declaration of Independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico briefly became an independent monarchy – the First Mexican Empire. For a few years in the mid-1860s, Mexico reverted to being a monarchy – the Second Mexican Empire. In both instances, the reigning emperor was forcibly deposed and then executed.

== First Mexican Empire (1821–1823) ==

=== Decree ===
The Sovereign Mexican Constituent Congress decreed on June 22, 1822 the following:

== Second Mexican Empire (1863–1867) ==

=== Decree ===
The Superior Government Junta by the Conservative Party decreed on July 11, 1863 the following:

<text>The brown-cheeked fulvetta (Alcippe poioicephala) is a babbler-like bird belonging to the family Alcippeidae found in the forests of South and Southeast Asia. It was formerly called the quaker babbler in India and common nun babbler in Malaya. They forage on trees for insects, sometimes hanging from the branches in a tit-like manner, and visiting flowers for nectar. They are often hard to see in vegetation but they have loud multi-note whistling calls in the morning and afternoon.

== Description ==

The brown-cheeked fulvetta is a small dull coloured bird measuring 15 cm from beak to tail tip. The grey bill is short and weak and the upper mandible is curved. The genus &quot;Alcippe&quot; has the bill widest at the nostrils which are long and has a membrane overhanging it. The tail feathers are all nearly of the same length. The wings are brownish, the underside is buff and the crown is grey. The crown is not demarcated from the rest of the head in the nominate subspecies but in some, there is a dark stripe that begins behind the eyes and meets at the nape. The sexes are indistinguishable and several birds may forage in a loose flock, sometimes joining mixed-species foraging flocks. While foraging, they are often tit-like, dangling below branches while searching for insect prey. Their calls especially during dawn are loud and can be mistaken for that of a magpie robin or puff-throated babbler.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The brown-cheeked fulvetta is a resident breeding bird of moist deciduous and evergreen forests particularly in the hills. They are distributed widely in peninsular India, with other populations to the east of the Brahmaputra river and extending into Southeast Asia. in Bangladesh, India and Southeast Asia. 

== Taxonomy ==

The species was described by Jerdon in the &quot;Madras Journal of Literature and Science&quot; in 1844 (but technically published in 1841) who placed the species within the broad genus &quot;Timalia&quot; and called it the small grey-headed babbler. His type specimen came from the Coonoor ghats. The bird was placed with the babblers in the subfamily Timaliinae for a significant period. The species was placed in the genus &quot;Alcippe&quot; by Blyth who created the genus in 1844. Oberholser created the genus &quot;Alcippornis&quot; as a substitute name in 1905 but this was based on a misunderstanding of the type species. The name Quaker (and sometimes nun babbler) babbler was used for the species when it was considered as a babbler. The family Timaliidae was considered a dustbin taxon for a long time. A series of molecular phylogeny studies of the babblers resulted in the splitting of the group into several clades including several family level splits. When the group was separated from the traditional babblers it was called as a fulvetta along with several other species. Further refining resulted in the separation from the majority of fulvettas but the common name has been retained. One of the resulting families was the Alcippeidae established in 2019 and containing a single genus &quot;Alcippe&quot;. 

Within its range, several subspecies have been named which vary in plumage (another &quot;Alcippe&quot; species has also been found to have substantial geographical variation through isolation and evolutionary history), the brown cheek is seen more prominently in some of the Southeast Asian populations: 

* &quot;A. p. poioicephala&quot; (Jerdon, 1844[1841]) - Western Ghats and southern peninsular India (includes &quot;A. p. brucei&quot; described from Mahabaleshwar which is used for the birds of the Eastern Ghats and central India. &quot;A. p. bourdilloni&quot; from Travancore described by Hume not recognized)
* &quot;A. p. haringtoniae&quot; - E Myanmar - has darkish subcoronal stripes on the head
* &quot;A. p. phayrei&quot; - S W Myanmar
* &quot;A. p. fusca&quot; - E Bangladesh
* &quot;A. p. alearis&quot; ) - S China (S Yunnan), N and C Laos, N Vietnam (W Tonkin) and N Thailand
* &quot;A. p. karenni&quot; - SE and S Myanmar (S to N Tenasserim) and adjacent W Thailand - (replaces the names &quot;magnirostris&quot; Walden, 1875 and &quot;blythi&quot; Collin and Hartert, 1927)
* &quot;A. p. davisoni&quot; - extreme S Myanmar (S Tenasserim) and N peninsular Thailand

==Ecology and behaviour==
The fulvetta has been suspected to have two broods in a year and nests have been observed from January to June with a peak in January–February. A study in southern India found 38 nests within 50,000 square metres. The nest is a cup, built with green moss, rootlets, lichen, leaves, and grass lined with rootlets and placed in a fork or suspended from the twigs at a mean height of 68.21 cm from ground. Mean nest width was 91.8 mm and depth 48.7 mm. Clutch size was two to three eggs and the incubation period is 10 ± 2 days and the nestling period is 12 ± 2 days. Hatching success was 55% while the nestling success was 32%. The most preferred plants for nesting were shrubs of the species &quot;Lasianthus ciliatus&quot; (36%) followed by the &quot;Saprosma fragrans&quot; (27%) and &quot;Thottea siliquosa&quot; (23%).

With their loud calls, it has been suggested that fulvettas have a role in the organization of mixed species foraging flocks and have been noted as being dominant members of flocks in Malayan forests.

The species visits flowers for nectar and has been recorded visiting the flowers of &quot;Erythrina&quot; and &quot;Cullenia exarillata.&quot; The ectoparasitic fly &quot;Ornithoctona australasiae&quot; (Fabricius, 1805) has been collected on brown-cheeked fulvettas from Malaya. A species of parasitic cestode, &quot;Dicranotaenia alcippina&quot;, has been described from the species.

<text>Joshua Michael Homme ( ; born May 17, 1973) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. He is best known as the founder and only continuous member of the rock band Queens of the Stone Age, which he formed in 1996. Homme is the band&#x27;s primary songwriter and mainly sings lead vocals and plays guitar. He also plays drums in the rock band Eagles of Death Metal, which he in 1998.

Homme began his career as the and guitarist of the rock band Kyuss, with whom he performed from 1987 to 1995. He then served as a touring guitarist for the rock band Screaming Trees from 1996 to 1998, leaving to start Queens of the Stone Age. He has also overseen a musical improv project with other musicians (mostly from the Palm Desert Scene) known as The Desert Sessions since 1997. He formed the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures alongside Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones in 2009, releasing their eponymous debut album later that year. In 2016, he produced, , and performed on the Iggy Pop album &quot;Post Pop Depression&quot;. He has also been involved with acts such as Royal Blood, Foo Fighters, Run the Jewels, and Arctic Monkeys.

==Early life==
Joshua Michael Homme was born in Palm Springs, California, on May 17, 1973. He grew up in a family in and around Palm Desert, California; his paternal grandfather, Clancy &quot;Cap&quot; Homme, moved to the area from North Dakota and was an early settler of the Valley. Cap has a private street named after him in Rancho Mirage, marking the original road to the Homme ranch, as well as a park named after him in an exclusive enclave of the Valley. The Homme surname is believed to be Norwegian. Homme moved with his family on a regular basis due to his father&#x27;s work, residing in many towns around the Valley. He later discussed having to &quot;create [his] own fun&quot; as a child growing up in the desert, stating that he did not start playing music to &quot;get girls or make money&quot; and that he assumed he would grow up to be a contractor like his father.

Homme also has ties in Idaho and has talked about his formative experiences there, such as seeing Carl Perkins perform at the Sandpoint Music Festival and the first time purchasing his own electric guitar (an Ovation Ultra GP) in a Sandpoint music store. He began playing guitar at the age of nine, after his parents denied his wishes for a drum kit. He took guitar lessons for the next few years but his teacher mostly focused on polka, so he supposedly did not learn of a barre chord or a pick until his third year of lessons, lending to his unique playing style. He joined his first band, Autocracy, in 1985 at the age of 12. Despite his musical success, he continued to work on his grandfather&#x27;s farm until releasing the first Queens of the Stone Age album at the age of 25, because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to lose [his] grip on reality&quot;.

==Career==
===Kyuss (1987–1995)===

In 1987, when he was 14 years old, Homme formed a punk rock-influenced heavy metal band in Palm Desert High School called Katzenjammer with schoolmates John Garcia, Brant Bjork, Nick Oliveri and Chris Cockrell. Homme was the band&#x27;s guitarist. After changing their name a few times, first to Sons of Kyuss (they released an EP of the same name), they finally shortened it to Kyuss. The band garnered a cult following by the early 1990s, often driving for hours to isolated locations in the desert and plugging into generators to perform. These events, known as &quot;generator parties&quot;, became urban legend among rock subculture. The band became both famous for their heavy, down tuned, groove oriented music, and infamous for their backstage fights with local LA bands when they traveled into town to play gigs. This soon brought the attention of Chris Goss, who became the band&#x27;s mentor, helping the band sign to a label and eventually producing them exclusively in an effort to preserve their sound. Due to Homme being younger than 18 at the time of the band&#x27;s signing, his parents signed the contract on his behalf. Kyuss released four albums (&quot;Wretch&quot;, &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot;, and &quot;...And the Circus Leaves Town&quot;), of which the final three Goss-produced efforts are often cited as cornerstones to the development of the stoner rock genre in the 1990s.

===Queens of the Stone Age (1996–present)===
When Kyuss split up in 1995, Homme moved to Seattle, Washington, briefly abandoning his desire for a music career and attending the University of Washington to study business. During this time, he fell back in with old musician friends such as Ben Shepherd and Mike Johnson, and eventually agreed to join the Screaming Trees as a rhythm guitarist on the summer Lollapalooza tour in 1996, a replacement for Johnson, and that continued into the following year. Homme and vocalist Mark Lanegan became close friends during this time but, disliking the rest of the band&#x27;s continual disharmony, began considering forming his own band. He founded Gamma Ray, a group more centered on his unique style and tastes, in 1996. After a cease and desist from a band of the same name, this band became Queens of the Stone Age.

Homme lived in Amsterdam for several months in 1996, which set forth events that would help kickstart the band. Roadrunner Records approached Homme to contribute to the label&#x27;s compilation &quot;Burn One Up! Music for Stoners&quot;, which led to the first Queens of the Stone Age song, &quot;18 A.D.&quot;, written with Dave Catching featuring Catching and members of Dutch stoner rock band Beaver on bass and drums. Homme also produced a song by Beaver for the compilation.

The band&#x27;s first release under the new name was the &quot;Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age&quot; compilation EP, featuring tracks from both Kyuss and songs recorded from the &quot;Gamma Ray&quot; EP sessions from 1996, released in late 1997. Queens of the Stone Age released their eponymous debut album in 1998. Initially, the band consisted of various friends of Homme&#x27;s from the Seattle area. Homme had asked a number of singers, including Lanegan, to perform as lead vocalist for Queens of the Stone Age, but by the time of recording the band&#x27;s debut album, he had moved back to Palm Desert and the band was pared down to just Homme and ex-Kyuss drummer Alfredo Hernandez. Homme was left to cover every other instrument and ended up singing for the first time in his career. Shortly after recording, Homme and Hernandez were joined by bassist and vocalist Nick Oliveri and guitarist, keyboardist, and lapsteel player Dave Catching, the band was now composed entirely of ex-Kyuss members and roadies.

Following their debut album, by which time Hernandez left the group, Queens of the Stone Age released the next album, &quot;Rated R&quot;, during which the band used a wider range of instruments to achieve a more relaxed, spacious and psychedelic sound. Though it differed from the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Rated R&quot; became Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s first mainstream hit. The next release, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, however, would gain even more buzz from the music community and fans alike. In &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, Homme continued his filtering of stoner rock and hard rock. The album centers on Homme&#x27;s memories of uncomfortable rides through the California desert, where he had performed in his days with Kyuss, and where there was little to do but listen to Spanish radio stations.

During this time, Homme had a falling out with Oliveri. Following the release of &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, their relationship deteriorated until Homme fired Oliveri from the band in 2004. Homme reportedly strongly considered breaking up the band at this point.

Homme began writing the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot;, named after a lyric from the &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; hidden track &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;. &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot;, created with &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; touring recruits Troy Van Leeuwen and Joey Castillo and collaborators and future recruits Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider of Eleven, was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, QOTSA&#x27;s best charting album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 to date.

Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;, was released in early June 2007 and received generally positive reviews from critics. Following the album&#x27;s touring cycle, the band took a break to focus on individual projects, during which Homme continued to produce and create more records outside the band. This break would unintentionally turn into a six-year gap between albums.

In 2010, following his work with rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures, Homme began performing more live shows with QOTSA. Following a deluxe reissue of &quot;Rated R&quot;, a 2011 re-release of their debut album and corresponding tour followed, featuring the album played front to back in the style in which it was recorded. This was the first time many of the songs had been performed live since the album&#x27;s original release.

On June 4, 2013, after a tumultuous writing and recording process, Queens of the Stone Age released their sixth album, &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;, receiving high praise from critics, as well as topping the Billboard 200 charts. &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot; highlights Homme&#x27;s collaborative recording process and features guests such as Elton John, Dave Grohl, Alex Turner, Jake Shears, Trent Reznor, Mark Lanegan, Nick Oliveri and Brody Dalle.

Their seventh album, &quot;Villains&quot;, was released in August 2017. The album contains no collaborations other than being produced by Mark Ronson, marking the first time the band has released an album with no featured guests on it.

In 2018, the band was featured on &quot;Revamp&quot;, a cover album containing various renditions of Elton John songs, on which they performed &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;.

The band&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;In Times New Roman...&quot;, was released in June 2023.

===The Desert Sessions (1997–present)===
Homme founded The Desert Sessions in 1997 at the Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California, describing it as a musical collective series &quot;that cannot be defined&quot;. He stated, &quot;At Desert Sessions, you play for the sake of music. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s good for musicians. If someday that&#x27;s not enough anymore, or that&#x27;s not the reason behind you doing it – that&#x27;s not your &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; – then a quick reminder like Desert Sessions can do so much for you, it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s easy to forget that this all starts from playing in your garage and loving it.&quot;

The recordings are done &quot;on the spot&quot; in a matter of hours, and the line-up constantly changes, with new contributors being added for each new recording. Artists such as PJ Harvey, Twiggy Ramirez, Dave Catching, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lanegan, Ben Shepherd, John McBain, Josh Freese, Chris Goss, Alain Johannes, Dean Ween, and many others from the Palm Desert Scene have contributed to The Desert Sessions recordings.

After 11 years of inactivity, Homme revealed in October 2014 that he would start working on more Desert Sessions material the following year. However, things remained silent until May 2019, when Homme posted an image on Instagram with the hashtags &quot;#Desert, #Sessions, #11, #12&quot;. In September, it was announced that &quot;Desert Sessions Volumes 11 &amp; 12&quot; will be released on October 25, 2019.

===Eagles of Death Metal (1998–present)===
In 1998, Homme formed Eagles of Death Metal with friend Jesse Hughes as a joke band in the context of the Desert Sessions. Recordings from the band first appeared on &quot;Volumes 3 &amp; 4&quot;, released that year. Over the next few years, Hughes settled into family life while Homme focused on Queens of the Stone Age. However, after Hughes&#x27; separation from his wife in 2003 and a spurt in creativity that resulted in dozens of songs, Homme convinced Hughes to pursue a full-time music career. Hughes writes, sings, and plays rhythm guitar, while Homme produces, arranges, and plays drums, bass, and various other instruments. So far, the band has released four albums: &quot;Peace, Love, Death Metal&quot; in 2004, &quot;Death by Sexy&quot; in 2006, &quot;Heart On&quot; in 2008, and most recently &quot;Zipper Down&quot; in 2015. Due to his commitments with Queens of the Stone Age and other projects, Homme does not regularly tour with Eagles of Death Metal, but occasionally makes appearances during live performances. In an October 2008 interview, he re-affirmed his commitment to the band saying, &quot;This isn&#x27;t a side project for me. I&#x27;m in two bands. I have musical schizophrenia, and this is one of those personalities.&quot;

===Them Crooked Vultures (2009–2010, 2022)===

In July 2009, it was revealed that Homme, Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones were recording together for a musical project named Them Crooked Vultures.
Though initially conceived as solely a studio project, the trio performed their first show together on August 9, 2009, in Chicago at The Metro to a crowd of approximately 1,100 ticketholders with additional live rhythm guitarist/auxiliary man Alain Johannes. Their album, &quot;Them Crooked Vultures&quot;, was released by Interscope Records in the United States on November 17, 2009, and by Sony Music internationally. The band launched a world tour including performing on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest on February 6, 2010, and at Austin City Limits on October 2, 2009, as well as many festivals through 2010. Them Crooked Vultures won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011.

Though the band has been inactive for an extended period due to the schedules of its members&#x27; other projects, all three of members have expressed interest in returning to the project. On September 3, 2022, they reunited for a performance at Wembley Stadium in honour of Foo Fighters&#x27; late drummer Taylor Hawkins and again on September 27 at the KIA Forum for the second Hawkins tribute show. The band covered Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; and Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s &quot;Long Slow Goodbye&quot;, and also played their songs &quot;Gunman&quot; and &quot;Dead End Friends&quot;.

===Other projects===
Homme has collaborated with acts such as Mondo Generator, Foo Fighters, PJ Harvey, Fatso Jetson, Mark Lanegan Band, Trent Reznor, Masters of Reality, Millionaire, Wellwater Conspiracy, Unkle, Primal Scream, Melissa Auf der Maur, Paz Lenchantin, Run the Jewels, Death from Above 1979, Earthlings?, Mastodon, Peaches, Lady Gaga, The Strokes, Local H, Biffy Clyro, Royal Blood, and Arctic Monkeys.

Homme, Nick Oliveri, and Brad Wilk contributed to the soundtrack for the 2002 film &quot;The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys&quot;. Homme and Alain Johannes were originally meant to develop a score for the video game &quot;Spec Ops&quot; in 2005, however the project was cancelled before it later became &quot;Spec Ops: The Line&quot; in 2012. His work on the game would go unused. Homme was also set to provide music, including a cover of Joe Walsh&#x27;s &quot;In the City&quot;, for the 2005 video game adaption of the film &quot;The Warriors&quot;. This also went unused.

Homme has been featured on compilation albums. He appeared on &quot;Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen&quot; for a cover of the song &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; alongside Eleven, as well as &quot;Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three&quot; and the Turbonegro tribute &quot;Alpha Motherfuckers&quot; as part of QOTSA covering the song &quot;Back to Dungaree High&quot;. The first use of the QOTSA name was on the compilation album &quot;Burn One Up! Music For Stoners&quot; featuring a one-off lineup of Homme and Dave Catching with Beaver members Milo Beenhakker and Eva Nahon, recording the song &quot;18 A.D.&quot;

Homme and frequent collaborator Chris Goss performed as The 5:15ers at the inaugural ArthurBall, an offshoot of the ArthurFest festival, in Los Angeles on January 26, 2006. The two were later credited as &quot;The Fififf Teeners&quot; when they co-produced QOTSA&#x27;s second album &quot;Rated R&quot; and fifth album &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;.

In August 2009, Homme collaborated with The Prodigy&#x27;s Liam Howlett for a remix of the Prodigy track &quot;Take Me to the Hospital&quot;. It was re-titled &quot;Take Me to the Hospital (Josh Homme and Liam H.&#x27;s Wreckage Remix)&quot;. That same year, he produced most of the Arctic Monkeys album &quot;Humbug&quot;. He later provided backing vocals on &quot;All My Own Stunts&quot; from their 2011 album &quot;Suck It and See&quot;, and vocals for the tracks &quot;One For the Road&quot; and &quot;Knee Socks&quot; on their 2013 album &quot;AM&quot;. Homme went on to appear at multiple Arctic Monkeys concerts in the USA including Austin City Limits and The Wiltern.

In June 2010, Homme appeared on the Comedy Central series &quot;Tosh.0&quot; to do an unplugged duet version of the hit viral song &quot;What What&quot; with Samwell. He also provided the theme song to &quot;Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, and collaborated with Mark Lanegan to provide the theme music for Anthony Bourdain&#x27;s travel show &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;.

In May 2012, it was revealed on Dean Delray&#x27;s comedy podcast &quot;Let There Be Talk&quot; that Homme would make a guest appearance on the album by Oliveri&#x27;s project Mondo Generator called &quot;Hell Comes To Your Heart&quot;. The album was recorded over three days at Homme&#x27;s Pink Duck Studios in Burbank, California, and features Homme playing guitar on the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;The Last Train&quot;. This marked the first time Homme and Oliveri collaborated since their public falling out in 2004. &quot;The Last Train&quot; also features fellow former Kyuss bandmate John Garcia providing vocals, which was recorded shortly before Homme&#x27;s lawsuit with Garcia regarding the Kyuss Lives! band name; it was the first time Homme had collaborated with Garcia since 1997.

In June 2012, it was revealed that Homme would be starring in the music video for the song &quot;A Better Place&quot; from Glen Campbell&#x27;s final album &quot;Ghost on the Canvas&quot;. In the video, Homme plays a bartender who shows Campbell a photo album of his life, from his early childhood through his music career to the present day. The video marked the end of Campbell&#x27;s musical career and was a retrospect on his life following his decision to retire after his diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In July, he had a very brief cameo at the end of Jack White&#x27;s music video for &quot;Freedom at 21&quot;, playing a police officer who intercepts White at a roadblock following White&#x27;s escapades throughout the video. In September, he contributed the song &quot;Nobody to Love&quot; to the soundtrack of the action-drama film &quot;End of Watch&quot;.

In early 2013, Homme and fellow Queens contributors Alain Johannes and Chris Goss added three tracks each to the soundtrack of Dave Grohl&#x27;s documentary &quot;Sound City: Real to Reel&quot;. Homme was interviewed for the documentary and is notably included in a scene where he collaborates with Grohl and Trent Reznor, under the name Sound City Players, to come up with a song called &quot;Mantra&quot;. Homme played bass and provided backing vocals on the track.

Homme has appeared in a number of television comedies. In December 2014, Homme made an appearance on Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Toast of London&quot;. The star of the show, Matt Berry, had been working alongside Morgana Robinson (the half-sister of Homme&#x27;s ex-wife Brody Dalle) in the BBC sitcom &quot;House of Fools&quot;, in which both had prominent roles. Earlier in the year, Homme had also made appearances on IFC&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot; and &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

In July 2015, Homme began hosting a weekly hour-long show called &quot;The Alligator Hour with Joshua Homme&quot; on Apple Music&#x27;s 24-hour streaming internet radio station Beats 1. The show features a highly eclectic selection of songs personally selected by Homme, interspersed with his own wry introductions of (and commentary on) the various tracks on that particular week&#x27;s playlist. The show&#x27;s musical selections typically have some sort of thematic, stream-of-consciousness-type relationship to each other.

In March 2016, Homme released a surprise album with Iggy Pop titled &quot;Post Pop Depression&quot;. The nine-track album was recorded at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California, as well as Homme&#x27;s Pink Duck Studios. Their backing band included guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita and drummer Matt Helders; the two joined Pop and Homme on tour, along with Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar and Matt Sweeney on bass. The band made their debut on January 21, 2016, on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, announcing the album, and proceeded on a North American and European theater tour that March, culminating in a performance at the Royal Albert Hall, filmed and released as a concert DVD. The album&#x27;s recording was also filmed and compiled into the 2017 documentary &quot;American Valhalla&quot;. In October 2016, Homme produced &quot;New Skin&quot;, the debut album from Nick Valensi&#x27;s new band CRX.

In 2017, Homme composed the score for Fatih Akin&#x27;s German-language drama &quot;In the Fade&quot;, named after the Queens of the Stone Age song.

In 2018, Homme sang a song written by Daniel Lanois called &quot;Cruel, Cruel World&quot; for the soundtrack of the Rockstar action-adventure video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;. The game features two versions of the song, with Homme&#x27;s version playing over the end credits and Willie Nelson&#x27;s version playing during the epilogue.

In 2020, Homme featured alongside Mavis Staples on the Run the Jewels song &quot;Pulling the Pin&quot; from their fourth album &quot;RTJ4&quot;. Later that year, he and Staples joined Run the Jewels (via separate pre-recorded performances displayed on giant screens due to the COVID-19 pandemic) to play the song during the group&#x27;s voter encouragement performance &quot;Holy Calamavote&quot;, broadcast on YouTube.

In 2021, Homme produced the songs &quot;Boilermaker&quot;, &quot;Space&quot;, and &quot;King&quot; from Royal Blood&#x27;s album &quot;Typhoons&quot;. &quot;Boilermaker&quot; was included on the standard album release, while &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;King&quot; were only available on the deluxe edition.

In 2024, Homme recorded a guitar part in his home studio and sent it to Ukraine for inclusion in &quot;Chaplain&quot;, a song by Ukrainian soldier Oleksandr Remez who is otherwise best known as the frontman of the rock band Ruky&#x27;v Bryuky; produced by Oleksandr Chemerov, the rest of the song was recorded in a mobile studio on the frontlines of the Russo-Ukrainian War as part of the Cultural Forces project to promote military music culture.

==Musical style==
Homme&#x27;s work is usually described as alternative rock, desert rock, hard rock, and stoner rock. He has been evasive in the past about the equipment he uses, changing the subject or occasionally lying when asked in interviews about his setup, as well as objecting to official photos of his pedalboard. He explained in June 2007, &quot;I don&#x27;t [share secrets] only because my sound is important to me and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of years just working it over with little tricks here and there, I almost feel like if you reveal too much of that you give away something that&#x27;s near and dear to you. It&#x27;s like you put it up on the altar and say, &#x27;Here, everyone take a slice.&#x27;&quot;

Homme relaxed his secretive approach to the subject in the 2010s, though much of his known equipment has been compiled through amateur photos and screenshots of him performing live and in the studio. In choosing his equipment, he tends to look for the odd or unique, opting to stay away from the typical choices of other guitar players. In an interview about guitars in 2008, he claimed at the time to own close to 35 guitars, and said that only three of them were &quot;really good&quot;. He has said that he purposely does not use famous guitars such as Stratocasters or Les Pauls, but that he is always in search of intriguing and unique guitars that are not always generally accepted as high-quality. He said that he tends to buy &quot;weird Japanese guitars&quot; or guitars that are &quot;scarred&quot; and have an interesting story.

==Charity work==
In 2013, Homme co-founded the Sweet Stuff Foundation, a charity that aims to give assistance to musicians, recording engineers, and their families struggling with illness and disability.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Homme met Australian singer and musician Brody Dalle at Lollapalooza in 1996, when he was 23 and she was 17; he was there to perform with Screaming Trees, while she was there to see her then-boyfriend (who was 31) Tim Armstrong&#x27;s band Rancid. They reconnected seven years later in 2003, during her separation from Armstrong, and began dating. Homme claimed to have received multiple death threats from fans of Armstrong and Rancid. The two were married on December 3, 2005. They have a daughter named Camille (born 2006) and two sons named Orrin (born 2011) and Wolf (born 2016).

Dalle filed for legal separation in November 2019 and divorce a month later, citing Homme&#x27;s alcoholism and drug abuse; he subsequently entered rehab, but he and Dalle would accuse each other of domestic violence and have mutual restraining orders filed over the following months. Dalle requested that restraining orders be filed against him on behalf of their sons in September 2021, alleging physical and emotional abuse, but was denied by two judges. In 2023, Homme won sole custody of the children and was granted a restraining order against Dalle after it was discovered that her new boyfriend had forged the children&#x27;s signatures on certain legal documents.

===Views and hobbies===
Homme once described himself as financially conservative and socially liberal, considering himself a &quot;fallen libertarian&quot;. He has said that he dislikes the idea of using his influence to tell people how to vote, and often likens his music to an &quot;ice cream parlour or arcade&quot; where people can simply have fun. Despite this, he referred to then-president Donald Trump as a &quot;retarded human being&quot; in June 2017 and began collaborating more with notably left-leaning artists such as Run the Jewels in the late 2010s.

Homme owns a few motorcycles, including a custom Falcon and a Harley-Davidson Ultra Classic. He drives a silver 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, which he was given as a gift when he was 14 years old; it is the only car he has ever owned. He owns several guns, including a Winchester rifle, a sawed-off shotgun, and a Beretta 9 mm pistol.

Homme has adopted multiple pseudonyms over the years. He used the name &quot;Carlo Von Sexron&quot; to credit his bass, keyboard, piano, and drums playing on albums such as &quot;The Desert Sessions Volumes 3 &amp; 4&quot;, &quot;Queens of the Stone Age&quot;, and &quot;Peace, Love, Death Metal&quot;. Homme is known as &quot;(King) Baby Duck&quot; to Dalle and the members of Eagles of Death Metal. He is also referred to as &quot;J.Ho.&quot; and &quot;The Ginger Elvis&quot;. Nick Oliveri referred to him as &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;.

Homme has over 20 tattoos. On his knuckles, he has his grandparents&#x27; nicknames (&quot;Cam&quot; for &quot;Camille&quot; on the left and &quot;Cap&quot; on the right) with hearts and his two sons&#x27; names (&quot;ORH&quot; for &quot;Orrin Ryder Homme&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot;). He has his daughter&#x27;s name, also Camille, tattooed over his heart. His left arm has a switchblade with &quot;Stay Sharp&quot; underneath, while his inner right arm has a straight razor with &quot;Born to Win&quot; inscribed; underneath, his nickname, &quot;Baby Duck&quot;, is a shared tattoo with his Eagles of Death Metal bandmate Jesse Hughes, who has his nickname &quot;Boots Electric&quot; in the same location. Homme also shares a tattoo that says &quot;Freitag 4:15&quot; with former Queens of the Stone Age bandmates Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan and their sound engineer Hutch, commemorating their &quot;worst show ever&quot; at the 2001 Rock Am Ring Festival in Germany on a Friday at 4:15 p.m. All were tattooed on their ribs so that it would hurt the most and serve as a reminder.

===Health issues===
In a 2011 interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Homme talked about how his leg surgery affected him: &quot;[In 2010] I had surgery on my leg and there were complications and I died on the table. I was in bed for three months.&quot; He became depressed and considered quitting music, eventually finding himself unable to produce any new music at all for almost two years. He has said that this experience greatly contributed to the making of the 2013 album &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;. He credits Transcendental Meditation with helping him recover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone 10/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Homme revealed on Steve Jones&#x27; radio show that he had recently tried to quit his decades-long smoking habit via hypnotherapy, but claimed that it failed because he was unable to relax enough to be fully influenced by the hypnotherapist. Three months later, Royal Blood frontman Mike Kerr discussed Homme&#x27;s drinking habits and told Radio X interviewer Gordon Smart, &quot;I can&#x27;t go anywhere near [Homme] without having an unbelievable amount of tequila in my body. I did hide from him once [while touring together] because I could hear him coming and I was like, &#x27;Oh no, I&#x27;m gonna have to do more tequila,&#x27; so I hid in the toilets of the dressing room.&quot; By 2023, Homme had completed rehab and was sober.

In an April 2023 interview with &quot;Revolver&quot;, Homme revealed that he had been diagnosed with a form of cancer in 2022, though he did not specify which type of cancer it was. He underwent a successful operation to remove the cancer from his body and spent the following year healing from it.

In July 2024, during the European leg of The End Is Nero World Tour, Queens of the Stone Age postponed a concert in Italy as Homme was forced to return to the U.S. for emergency surgery of an undisclosed nature. They later announced the cancelation or postponement of all shows in 2024 due to Homme requiring &quot;essential medical care&quot; for the remainder of the year.

===Legal issues and controversies===

In 2004, Homme was arrested for assaulting Dwarves frontman Blag Dahlia and Karl Doyle at the Dragonfly club in Los Angeles. Pleading no contest, he was ordered to remain at least 100 yards away from Dahlia and the club, sentenced to three years&#x27; probation with community service, and forced to enter a rehab program for 60 days.

In June 2008, at the Norwegian Wood Festival in Oslo, Homme drew criticism for his reaction to an audience member who had thrown a shoe at him. He called the audience member a &quot;chicken-shit fucking faggot&quot; and &quot;a 12-year-old dickless fucking turd&quot;. The incident drew accusations of homophobia from several blogs, which were later picked up by the mainstream media. Homme eventually responded in a public letter in which he denied all accusations of homophobia. Reaction to his apology was mixed, with music journalist Tim Jonze stating, &quot;Attempting to prove his pro-gay stance, Homme points out in his letter that he also called the guy a pussy and threatened to have anal sex with him. OK, so it&#x27;s a fuzzy kind of logic we&#x27;re talking about here.&quot; In an interview 10 years later, Homme revealed that he had often been beaten up during his youth while trying to defend his gay older brother from homophobic bullying.

Following a September 2013 performance at Jay-Z&#x27;s Made in America Festival, Homme made comments about Jay-Z during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Strombo Show&quot;. He explained that his band was frisked by the event&#x27;s security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay-Z&#x27;s personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt: &quot;[Jay-Z] has his security frisking the bands on the way in. I just told them, &#x27;If you open up my bag I&#x27;m not playing, so I guess it&#x27;s up to you whether we are playing or not.&#x27; [...] He also gave us some champagne and wanted us to take a photo with it. And I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s not a gift, that is a marketing tool.&#x27; So I destroyed it.&quot;

In December 2017, Homme was captured on video kicking the camera of Shutterstock photographer Chelsea Lauren into her face during KROQ&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas concert in Los Angeles. After staying through the show and photographing subsequent bands, Lauren went to Cedars-Sinai for treatment. In a statement, Homme claimed that he had been kicking over lighting equipment and was unaware that he had kicked Lauren until he was informed of it the next day. Lauren disputed this, stating that he had made eye contact with her before kicking her. Homme later issued a video response in which he admitted to kicking Lauren and apologized to her.

<text>DigitalGlobe was an American commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, and operator of civilian remote sensing spacecraft. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange on 14 May 2009, selling 14.7 million shares at US$19.00 each to raise US$279 million in capital. On 5 October 2017, Maxar Technologies completed its acquisition of DigitalGlobe.

The company&#x27;s &quot;WorldView&quot; satellites should not be confused with the unrelated WorldView company (a stratospheric balloon operator).

== Origins ==
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in Oakland, California in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business. Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high resolution commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act. The company was initially funded with private financing from Silicon Valley sources and interested corporations in North America, Europe and Japan. Dr. Scott was head of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot; and &quot;Brilliant Eyes&quot; projects which were part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the Intergraph Corporation. The company&#x27;s first remote sensing license from the United States Department of Commerce allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing satellite capable of collecting images with resolution.

In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.&#x27;s commercial remote sensing operations.

In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.

In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider GlobeXplorer to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.

In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the Space Foundation&#x27;s Space Technology Hall of Fame for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.

In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.

In February 2017, MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US$2.4 billion. As of May 2017, DigitalGlobe&#x27;s image catalog contains 100 petabytes worth of data, and grows by 100 terabytes each day. As of 5 October 2017, MDA has announced it has completed its acquisition of DigitalGlobe. On 5 October 2017, DigitalGlobe and MDA Holdings Company merged to become Maxar Technologies

On 30 December 2019, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell MDA to a consortium of financial sponsors led by Northern Private Capital for CAD$1 billion (US$765 million). The sale included all of MDA&#x27;s Canadian businesses, encompassing ground stations, radar satellite products, robotics, defense, and satellite components, representing approximately 1,900 employees.

On 8 April 2020, the sale of the MDA assets to NPC officially closed. The newly formed privately held Canadian company was named MDA.

== Satellites ==
=== EarlyBird-1 ===
EarlyBird-1 (COSPAR 1997-085A) commercial Earth imaging satellite was built for EarthWatch Inc. by CTA Space Systems (later part of Orbital Sciences Corporation) and launched on 24 December 1997, from the Svobodny Cosmodrome by a Start-1 launch vehicle. It had a mass of and a design life of 3 years (fuel reserves for 5 years). It included a panchromatic (black-and-white) camera with a resolution and a multispectral (color) camera with a resolution. The imaging sensor was derived from a 1998-cancelled NASA satellite called Clark (SSTI 2). EarlyBird-1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome. Although the launch was successful, the satellite lost communications after only four days in orbit due to power system failure.

=== IKONOS ===
IKONOS was launched 24 September 1999. It was the world&#x27;s first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with resolution. On 31 March 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the Earth.

=== QuickBird ===
QuickBird, launched on 18 October 2001, was DigitalGlobe&#x27;s primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a altitude, 98° inclination Sun-synchronous orbit. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1; after this, the second satellite of the series, QuickBird-2 was launched and it is this satellite that became known simply as QuickBird (as no other QuickBird satellites were launched). It included a panchromatic camera with a resolution and a multispectral camera with a resolution. On 27 January 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.

=== GeoEye-1 ===
The GeoEye-1 satellite collects images at panchromatic (black-and-white) and multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to of multispectral imagery per day. This is used for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.

=== WorldView satellite system ===
==== WorldView-1 ====
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-1. It was launched on 18 September 2007 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II 7920-10C. Launch services were provided by United Launch Alliance (ULA). The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is expected to be a major customer of WorldView-1 imagery. It included a panchromatic only camera with a maximum resolution.

==== WorldView-2 ====
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-2. It was launched on 8 October 2009. DigitalGlobe partnered with Boeing commercial launch services to deliver WorldView-2 into a Sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite includes a panchromatic sensor with a maximum resolution and a multispectral sensor of 

==== WorldView-3 ====
Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on 13 August 2014. It has a maximum resolution of . WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of , where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to .

Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a higher resolution than to the U.S. military. However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the United States Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to panchromatic and multispectral ground sample distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V launch vehicle in the 401 configuration on 13 August 2014, at 18:30 UTC from Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 3 (SLC-3E) at Vandenberg Air Force base.

WorldView-3 is the industry&#x27;s first multi-payload, super-spectral, high-resolution commercial satellite.

==== WorldView-4 ====
The WorldView-4 satellite was designed to provide panchromatic images at a highest resolution of , and multispectral images at . Originally named GeoEye-2, the spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin, while the camera payload was provided by ITT Corporation.

Following the merger of GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, in 2013, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 would be completed as a ground spare to be launched if or when required. It was renamed to WorldView-4 in July 2014, when the company announced that it would be launched in Fall 2016. It was launched on 11 November 2016.

In January 2019, the company reported the failure of a control moment gyroscope on the satellite, rendering it inoperable.

==== WorldView Legion ====
Currently being built by Maxar Technologies, WorldView Legion is Maxar&#x27;s next generation of Earth observation satellites. WorldView Legion comprises six satellites planned to launch between 2024 and 2026 into a mix of Sun-synchronous and mid-latitude orbits. These satellites will replace imaging capability currently provided by Maxar&#x27;s WorldView-1, WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 Earth observation satellites.

The six WorldView Legion satellites are contracted to launch on three flight-proven SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicles.

== Customers and competitors ==
DigitalGlobe&#x27;s customers range from urban planners, to conservation organizations like the Amazon Conservation Team, to the U.S. federal agencies, including NASA and the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Much of Google Earth and Google Maps high resolution-imagery is provided by DigitalGlobe. 

DigitalGlobe&#x27;s main competitor is Airbus with Spot and Pleiades satellites.

<doc id="636085" wikidata="Q6833299" url="?curid=636085" title="Caning of Michael Fay">
<text>In 1994, a court in Singapore sentenced an American teenager, Michael Fay (born 30 May 1975), to be lashed six times with a cane for violating the Vandalism Act. This caused a temporary strain in relations between Singapore and the United States.

Fay was arrested for stealing road signs and vandalizing 18 cars over a ten-day period in September 1993. Fay pled guilty, but he later claimed that he was advised that such a plea would preclude caning and that his confession was false, that he never vandalized any cars, and that the only crime he committed was stealing road signs. Although caning is a routine court sentence in Singapore, Fay&#x27;s sentence garnered controversy and was widely covered in the media in the United States, as it was believed to be the first judicial corporal punishment involving an American citizen. The number of cane strokes in Fay&#x27;s sentence was ultimately reduced from six to four after United States officials requested leniency, and the sentence was carried out on May 5, 1994.

==Early life==
Fay&#x27;s parents divorced when he was a child. After living with his father for a time, he was sent to Singapore to live with his mother and stepfather, where he was enrolled in the Singapore American School.

==Theft and vandalism in Singapore==
In September 1993, 67 cars were vandalized in various neighborhoods of Singapore. The damage included spray painting and being pelted with eggs, and at least one had its windshield smashed.

The Singapore police eventually arrested two teenagers who were driving a car similar to one that witnesses had described as being involved in the vandalism. During questioning, the two gave seven names, all male students from the Singapore American School and ISS International School, whom police tracked down and raided. They found about 50 stolen items, including a telephone booth and road signs.

Fay was one of these students. He pleaded guilty to two counts of vandalism, referring to two cars that were spray-painted in a car park in mid-September; two counts of mischief; and one count of keeping 16 stolen items. Fay later claimed that he had been intimidated and threatened during the police interrogation, and maintained that he had been advised such a plea would preclude caning and that his confession was false, that he never vandalized any cars, and that the only crime he committed was stealing signs.

Under the 1966 Vandalism Act, originally passed to curb the spread of political graffiti and which specifically penalized vandalism of government property, Fay was sentenced on March 3, 1994, to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,230 or £1,450 at the time), and six strokes of the cane. Another student who pleaded not guilty was sentenced to eight months in prison and 12 strokes of the cane.

Fay&#x27;s lawyers lost on appeal after arguing that the Vandalism Act provided caning only for forms of graffiti vandalism, and that the damaged cars had been cheaply restored to their original condition.

==Response==
===Media and public reactions===
Following Fay&#x27;s sentence, the case received coverage by the American, Singaporean and international media.

Some US news outlets launched scathing attacks on Singapore&#x27;s judicial system for what they considered an &quot;archaic punishment&quot;, while others turned the issue into one of Singapore asserting &quot;Asian values&quot; towards &quot;western decadence&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ran editorials and op-eds condemning the punishment. &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that the caning involved &quot;bits of flesh flying with each stroke.&quot;

However, Singapore also found supporters among the foreign media and the US public. For example, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Mike Royko reported that he had been sent a large number of letters, nearly all of which supported the punishment. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; poll found that Americans were evenly divided (49% approved, 48% disapproved) as to the appropriateness of the punishment, but would have only been 36% in favor had the sentence been handed down inside the US.

===From the United States government===
The Clinton administration ultimately expressed its objection to Singapore&#x27;s decision to cane Fay. The official position of the United States government was that although it recognized Singapore&#x27;s right to punish Fay within the due process of law, the punishment of caning was &quot;excessive&quot; for a teenager who committed a non-violent crime.

On March 3, 1994, the day the sentence was passed, Chargé d&#x27;Affaires Ralph Boyce at the United States Embassy in Singapore had also said that the punishment was too severe for the offence. The embassy claimed that, while the graffiti and physical damage to the cars was not permanent, caning could leave Fay with permanent physical scars.

Bill Clinton, the then-President of the United States, also called Fay&#x27;s punishment &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;mistaken&quot;, and pressured the Singapore government to grant Fay clemency from caning. Two dozen United States senators signed a letter to the Singapore government also appealing for clemency.

===From the Singapore government===
The Singapore government stood its ground and defended the sentence and the country&#x27;s right to uphold its own laws. On March 3, in response to Boyce&#x27;s comments on Fay&#x27;s sentence, the Ministry of Home Affairs said that it was Singapore&#x27;s tough laws that kept the country orderly and relatively crime-free, unlike &quot;in cities like New York City, where even police cars are not spared the acts of vandals&quot;. Various Singaporean ministers also spoke publicly about the case throughout the episode. In April during a local television program, Lee Kuan Yew, then Senior Minister, said that the US was neither safe nor peaceful because it did not dare to restrain or punish those who did wrong, adding, &quot;If you like it this way, that is your problem. But, that is not the path we choose.&quot;

Nevertheless, on May 4 that year, the Singapore government via Ong Teng Cheong, then the country&#x27;s President, announced that the number of cane strokes would be reduced from six to four out of consideration for President Clinton as it valued the good historical relations between both countries. The other student&#x27;s sentence was later also reduced, from 12 strokes to six, after a similar clemency appeal. Fay was caned on May 5, 1994, at the Queenstown Remand Centre.

==Caning==

Describing the caning day, Fay told Reuters that he did not know the time had come for punishment when he was taken from his cell. He said he was bent over a trestle so his buttocks stuck out, with his hands and feet buckled to the structure. He was naked except for a protective rubber pad fixed to his back. The flogger, a doctor, and prison officials were also present. Fay told Reuters the caner walked sharply forward three steps to build power. &quot;They go &#x27;Count one&#x27;—you hear them yell it really loud—and a few seconds later they come, I guess I would call it charging at you with a rattan cane.&quot; Fay reported that when the fourth stroke was delivered he was immediately unbuckled from the trestle and taken to a cell to recover. The caning, which Fay estimated took one minute, left a &quot;few streaks of blood&quot; running down his buttocks, and seven weeks later, left three dark-brown scar patches on his right buttock and four lines each about half-an-inch wide on his left buttock. He said that the wounds hurt for about five days after which they itched as they healed. &quot;The first couple of days it was very hard to sit,&quot; Fay reported, but he said he was able to walk after the caning.

== Aftermath ==
After his release from prison in June 1994, Fay returned to the United States to live with his biological father. He gave several television interviews, including one with his American lawyer on CNN with Larry King on June 29, 1994, in which he admitted taking road signs but denied vandalizing cars. While he did not detail his experience, he said that he was &quot;ill-treated&quot; at times during questioning, but had shaken hands with the caning operative after his four strokes had been administered and the prison guards when he was released.

Several months after returning to the United States, Fay suffered burns to his hands and face after a butane incident. He was subsequently admitted to the Hazelden rehabilitation program for butane abuse. He said that sniffing butane &quot;made [him] forget what happened in Singapore.&quot; In 1996, he was cited in Florida for a number of violations, including careless driving, reckless driving, not reporting a crash, and having an open bottle of alcohol in a car. Later, in 1998, still in Florida, Fay was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, charges to which he confessed but was acquitted because of technical errors in his arrest.

In June 2010, Fay&#x27;s case was recalled in international news, after another foreigner in Singapore, Swiss national Oliver Fricker, was sentenced to five months in jail and three strokes of the cane for trespassing a rail depot to vandalise a metro train that is a part of the country&#x27;s Mass Rapid Transit.

== In popular culture ==
*Season 19, episode 18 of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cold-opened with a skit of Michael Fay&#x27;s caning. The players included host Emilio Estevez as Fay, Kevin Nealon administering the caning, Rob Schneider as the warden, and Phil Hartman as the doctor.
*In September 1994, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic released the song &quot;Headline News&quot; (a parody of the Crash Test Dummies hit &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;), which satirized the Fay case along with the Tonya Harding and John and Lorena Bobbitt stories.
*In October 1994, Death Row Records released the soundtrack album Murder Was The Case, which contained the song &quot;Natural Born Killaz&quot;, performed by Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, where Ice Cube references the incident in his second verse.
*The case inspired a 1995 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Bart vs. Australia&quot;, in which Australia is to punish Bart via &quot;booting&quot;—a kick in the buttocks using a giant boot (later reduced to a shoe).
*In the 1997 film &quot;One Eight Seven&quot;, Dave Childress (John Heard), a burned-out teacher, upon hearing that his co-worker Trevor Garfield (Samuel L. Jackson) was stabbed by a student, who was then sent to a juvenile facility, comments &quot;They should&#x27;ve caned the bastard like they did that kid in Singapore.&quot; and quotes Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s statement in favor of caning.

<doc id="636088" wikidata="Q627660" url="?curid=636088" title="Millennium Challenge 2002">
<text>Millennium Challenge 2002 (MC02) was a major war game exercise conducted by the United States Armed Forces under JFCOM in mid-2002, running from 24 July to 15 August. The exercise involved both live exercises and computer simulations, costing (equivalent to about $M in ), the most expensive war game in US military history. MC02 was set in 2007, intended to be a test of future military &quot;transformation&quot;—a transition towards new technologies that enabled network-centric warfare, and providing a more effective command and control of current and future weaponry and tactics. The simulated combatants were the United States, referred to as &quot;Blue&quot;, and a fictitious state in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Red&quot;, often characterized as Iran or Iraq.

MC02 was an experiment mandated by Congress in 2000 to &quot;explore critical war fighting challenges at the operational level of war that will confront United States joint military forces after 2010.&quot; The simulation took two years of planning and involved 13,000 troops. The Red force, led by retired Marine Corps Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, used numerous asymmetrical tactics unanticipated by the Blue force, resulting in initial major successes. Over the course of the simulation, heavy constraints were placed on the Red force&#x27;s ability to free-play &quot;to the point where the end state was scripted&quot;, resulting in a Blue victory.

== Scenario overview ==
MC02 was set in the year 2007, centered around a fictional regional power, &quot;Red,&quot; located in a strategically significant area of the world. Following a devastating earthquake, Red experienced widespread instability, leading to the emergence of a renegade faction led by a military commander, known as CJTF-South. Operating independently from the central government, CJTF-South sought to assert control over Red and its surrounding region through several means including conventional military operations, asymmetric warfare, terrorism, economic manipulation, and propaganda.

One of the central points of conflict was a territorial dispute over a series of strategically important islands. CJTF-South seized these islands and established a controversial military escort service to protect ships navigating through the region, charging a toll for its services. This led to a direct military response from &quot;Blue,&quot; whose primary objectives were to secure international shipping lanes, neutralize Red&#x27;s weapons of mass effect (WME) capabilities, and restore sovereignty over the disputed islands, as mandated by a World Court ruling. Additionally, Blue sought to halt CJTF-South&#x27;s push for regional hegemony.

The opposing forces in the scenario consisted of several distinct elements: CJTF-South’s military forces, the national leadership of the Government of Red (GOR), and a variety of terrorist groups, including pirates, mercenaries, and criminal organizations. Each of these groups had different objectives, but common goals among them included resisting Blue’s presence and influence in the region, maintaining or restoring power in Red, and advancing their own political or economic agendas.

CJTF-South&#x27;s aims were to preserve its political influence, deter Blue intervention, limit Blue’s strategic objectives, and promote economic recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake, while also consolidating regional control and influence. The GOR similarly sought to maintain its hold on power, limit foreign intervention, and aid in the country&#x27;s recovery. Meanwhile, terrorist factions focused on disrupting Blue’s operations, attacking rival political and religious groups, and destabilizing the region further.

== Constraints ==
Since the war game allowed for a ship-to-shore landing of ground troops at some (unknown) point during the 14 day exercise, and because their naval force was substantial, the Blue force was positioned on the shore-side of the region&#x27;s active shipping lanes to keep them from impacting commerce during the exercise. This placed them near the Red shore rather than at a &quot;standoff&quot; distance. Conducting the war games during peacetime also meant that there were a large number of friendly/unaligned ships and aircraft in the zone, restricting the use of automated defense systems and more cautious Rules of Engagement. Red&#x27;s tactics took full advantage of these factors, and to great effect.

== Exercise action ==

Red, commanded by retired Marine Corps Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, adopted an asymmetric strategy, in particular, simulating using old methods to evade Blue&#x27;s sophisticated electronic surveillance network. Van Riper simulated using motorcycle messengers to transmit orders to front-line troops and World-War-II-style light signals to launch airplanes without radio communications in the model.

Red received an ultimatum from Blue, essentially a surrender document, demanding a response within 24 hours. Thus warned of Blue&#x27;s approach, Red used a fleet of small boats to determine the position of Blue&#x27;s fleet by the second day of the exercise. In a preemptive strike, Red launched a massive salvo of cruise missiles that overwhelmed the Blue forces&#x27; electronic sensors and destroyed sixteen warships: one aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of Blue&#x27;s six amphibious ships. An equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel. Soon after the cruise missile offensive, another significant portion of Blue&#x27;s navy was &quot;sunk&quot; by an armada of small Red boats, which carried out both conventional and suicide attacks that capitalized on Blue&#x27;s inability to detect them as well as expected.

Such defeat can be attributed to various shortfall in simulation capabilities and design that significantly hindered Blueforce fighting and command capabilities. Examples include: a time lag in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information being forwarded to the Blueforce by the simulation master, various glitches that limited Blue ships point-defense capabilities and error in the simulation which placed ships unrealistically close to Red assets.

== Exercise suspension and restart ==
At this point, the exercise was suspended, Blue&#x27;s ships were &quot;re-floated&quot;, and the rules of engagement were changed; this was later justified by General Peter Pace as follows: &quot;You kill me in the first day and I sit there for the next 13 days doing nothing, or you put me back to life and you get 13 more days&#x27; worth of experiment out of me. Which is a better way to do it?&quot;
After the war game was restarted, its participants were forced to follow a script drafted to ensure a Blue Force victory.
Among other rules imposed by this script, Red Force was ordered to turn on their anti-aircraft radar in order for them to be destroyed, and during a combined parachute assault by the 82nd Airborne Division and Marines air assaulting on the then new and still controversial CV-22, Van Riper&#x27;s forces were ordered not to shoot down any of the approaching aircraft. Van Riper also claimed that exercise officials denied him the opportunity to use his own tactics and ideas against Blue Force, and that they also ordered Red Force not to use certain weapons systems against Blue Force and even ordered the location of Red Force units to be revealed. The postmortem JFCOM report on MC02 would say &quot;As the exercise progressed, the OPFOR free-play was eventually constrained to the point where the end state was scripted. This scripting ensured a blue team operational victory and established conditions in the exercise for transition operations.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
The rule changes following the restart led to accusations that the war game had turned from an honest, open, free playtest of U.S. war-fighting capabilities into a rigidly controlled and scripted exercise intended to end in an overwhelming U.S. victory, alleging that &quot;$250 million was wasted&quot;.
Van Riper was extremely critical of the scripted nature of the new exercise and resigned from the exercise in the middle of the war game. Van Riper later said that Vice Admiral
Marty Mayer altered the exercise&#x27;s purpose to reinforce existing doctrine and notions within the U.S. military rather than serving as a learning experience.

Van Riper also stated that the war game was rigged so that it appeared to validate the modern, joint-service war-fighting concepts it was supposed to be testing. He was quoted in the ZDF–&quot;New York Times&quot; documentary &quot;The Perfect War&quot; (2004) as saying that what he saw in MC02 echoed the same view promoted by the Department of Defense under Robert McNamara before and during the Vietnam War, namely that the U.S. military could not and would not be defeated.

Responding to Van Riper&#x27;s criticism, Vice Admiral Mayer, who ran the war game and who was charged with developing the military&#x27;s joint concepts and requirements, stated the following:
Navy Captain John Carman, Joint Forces Command spokesman, said the war game had properly validated all the major concepts which were tested by Blue Force, ignoring the restrictions placed on Van Riper&#x27;s Red Force that led them to succeed. Based on these findings, Carman stated that recommendations based on the war game&#x27;s result on areas such as doctrine, training, and procurement would be forwarded to General Richard Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<text>Spot Image, a public limited company created in 1982 by the French Space Agency, Centre National d&#x27;Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the IGN, and Space Manufacturers (Matra, Alcatel, SSC, etc.) is a subsidiary of Airbus Defence and Space (99%). The company is the commercial operator for the SPOT Earth observation satellites.

== Network and partners ==
Spot Image is a worldwide distributor of products and services using imagery from Earth observation satellites and works through a network of subsidiaries, local offices (Australia, Brazil, China, United States, Japan, Peru, Singapore), and partners. The goal is to provide on-the-spot service with worldwide availability.

Spot Image works with a network of more than 30 direct receiving stations handling images acquired by the SPOT satellites.

Spot Image collaborates with EU&#x27;s GMES/Copernicus programme, shares geographic information with the OGC and contributes to the interoperability of web services; with Infoterra Global it continues to offer services for precision-agriculture.

== Satellites ==

The 3 SPOT satellites in orbit (Spot 5, 6, and 7) provide images with a large choice of resolutions – from 2.5 m to 10 m. Spot Image also distributes multiresolution data from other optical satellites, in particular from Formosat-2 (Taiwan) and Kompsat-2 (South Korea), for which it has exclusive distribution rights, and from radar satellites (TerraSAR-X, ERS, Envisat, Radarsat). Spot Image is also the exclusive distributor of data from the very-high resolution Pleiades satellites. The launch of Pléiades-1, via a Soyuz rocket, was confirmed on December 16, 2011. The second (Pléiades-2) was launched mid-2012. Spot Image also offers infrastructures for receiving and processing, as well as added value options.

<text>Warsaw Chopin Airport (, ) is an international airport in the Włochy district of Warsaw, Poland. It is the busiest airport in Poland and the 28th busiest airport in Europe with 21.3 million passengers in 2024, handling approximately 40% of the country&#x27;s total air passenger traffic. The airport is a central hub for LOT Polish Airlines as well as a base for Enter Air and Wizz Air.

Warsaw Chopin Airport covers of land and handles approximately 300 scheduled flights daily, including a substantial number of charters. London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam are the busiest international connections, while Kraków, Wrocław, and Gdańsk are the most popular domestic ones. Founded in 1934, the airport was previously known as Warsaw-Okęcie Airport () and bore the name of its Okęcie neighborhood throughout its history. It was renamed in honour of Polish composer and former Warsaw resident Frédéric Chopin in 2001. Despite the official change, &quot;Okęcie&quot; &quot;()&quot; remains in popular and industry use, including air traffic and aerodrome references.

An underground railway station connecting from the airport to Warsaw&#x27;s suburban rail system was opened in June 2012 in time for the Euro 2012 football championships, and on 25 November 2013, the airport announced accommodating – for the first time in history – its 10 millionth passenger in a single year. The airport would go on and double the amount of passengers 11 years later, welcoming its 20 millionth passenger on 6 December 2024 and 21 millionth on 26 December 2024.

A new and modern terminal was completed in 2015. The Chopin Airport is one of the three airports serving the Warsaw metropolitan area, along with Warsaw Modlin Airport, which opened in 2012, and the Warsaw Radom Airport, which opened in 2023.

==History==
===The pre-war and wartime Okęcie (1934–45)===
In 1924, when urban development around Warsaw&#x27;s aerodrome at Mokotów Field (Pole Mokotowskie) began affecting air traffic, the Ministry of Railways purchased land near the village of Okęcie to construct a new airport. On 29 April 1934, the Polish president, Ignacy Mościcki, opened Central Airport (Okęcie), which from then on took over the handling of all traffic from the former civilian aerodrome at Pole Mokotowskie. In the weeks after its opening, a journalist from the magazine &quot;Flight and Air Defence of Poland&quot; reported the following: &quot;In a large pastel-coloured hall, we see a ticket office, a customs post, telegraph and post office, police station and a kiosk with various newspapers etc... On the first (upper) floor, there is a restaurant and viewing terrace, from where one can see the entire territory of the airport.&quot; 

With the building finished in 1933, the new modernist premises of the Warsaw airport cost the State Treasury around zl 10 million. The new complex included three hangars, exhibition space, garages, and of course a large, modern terminal building with a concrete taxiway complete with stands for a number of aircraft. Warsaw thus received an airport befitting of any European capital city. In its first year of operation, Okęcie served over 10,000 passengers. After the aerodrome&#x27;s civilian buildings were finished, the military potential of the site began to be developed, with a Polish Air Force base opening soon after; later followed the buildings of the Institute of Aviation, PZL aircraft-building plant and other pieces of aviation infrastructure. 

As air traffic and the number of aircraft movements grew greatly year on year, the authorities identified the need to develop a new system for air traffic navigation and control. The state, as a result, marked a number of air corridors for use by civil airlines, whilst radio stations were established to regulate such traffic and divert it away from sensitive and restricted areas. By 1938, the airport was equipped with 16 immigration checkpoints for passengers both departing and arriving on international flights. These posts were then manned by the Polish Border Guard. By 1937, the airport had also received new radio navigation equipment and was using Lorenz beam technology to assure the safety of landings and approaches over Warsaw, during periods of poor visibility or bad weather. On the eve of World War II, Okęcie airport was connected by regular scheduled flights with 6 domestic and 17 foreign airports, among which were Tel-Aviv (then in Palestine) and Beirut in Lebanon; there were also plans to soon begin transatlantic service to the United States.

During World War II, Okęcie was often used as a battleground between the German Army and Polish resistance and was almost completely destroyed. From the very first day of the war in Poland, Okęcie became a target for bombing by the German Luftwaffe. Later, once Warsaw was occupied by the German army, the airport became the base for two German aviation schools and a Junkers aircraft repair works. During this period, the airport also received its first concrete runway and taxiways; these were left undamaged until the very final days of the war, despite numerous attacks by both the Home Army and Soviet Armed Forces. However, with the German withdrawal from the city, both Okęcie&#x27;s remaining buildings and ground infrastructure (including the runway) were intentionally destroyed in order to deny their use to the advancing Red Army and Polish First Army.

===Rebuilding Okęcie in the years 1945–89===
After the war, LOT Polish Airlines resumed operations at Okęcie using what was left of the pre-war infrastructure; the airline was also responsible for initiating reconstruction efforts at the airport, and soon, within two years, a new terminal, control tower and a number of stands for aircraft based at and visiting the new Okęcie had been completed.

By the end of the 1940s, the airport had been reconnected with most of Poland&#x27;s most important cities and a number of international services, including those to Moscow, Belgrade, Berlin, Bucharest, Budapest, Brussels, Copenhagen, Prague and Stockholm. In the first half of the 1950s, this development continued and the airport authorities continued to hold talks with many international airlines on the subject of opening routes to Warsaw. In 1956, maintenance of Okęcie was transferred from LOT Polish Airlines to state administration, then later in 1959, on the government&#x27;s initiative, a decision was made to reconstruct the airport&#x27;s main terminal; this, however, did not actually take place until 1964.

The new civil aviation authority began to exercise control over airports, air corridors and routing, ground aviation infrastructure and the responsibility for entering into and signing aviation accords with other states. This gave the authority effectively complete control over Warsaw&#x27;s airport.

In 1969, the new terminal officially became operational, with it celebrating, just one year later, its first million passengers served. However, it soon became apparent that the new terminal was too small. As a result of this situation, and to alleviate the problems it was causing, part of the airport&#x27;s administrative office was moved to the south of the terminal and into makeshift buildings and the old airport premises on Ul. 17 Stycznia. A new separate, temporary arrival hall was then built. Meanwhile, domestic flights continued to operate from the facilities built on the site of the pre-war terminal. Some years later, in 1978, a new arrivals hall, the so-called &#x27;Finnish Hall&#x27; opened. Thereafter, there was a further upgrade to the airport&#x27;s runways, and after the renovation of runways 1 and 3, runway 2 was re-designated as taxiway &#x27;Delta&#x27;; this was because of its location on the same axis as a number of major obstacles, most notably the Palace of Culture and Science and Raszyn radio transmitter.

Political events of the early 1980s caused a decline in passenger traffic, but already by 1983, there was renewed growth, especially on international routes. However, it turned out that the existing airport infrastructure was not able to handle as much traffic as the airport was dealing with by this period; thus, in November 1986, the Government decided to expand the airport. In the face of economic reform in the late 1980s, there was also a need to create a new managing body for airports and air traffic in Poland. In October 1987, a new company, the State Enterprise &quot;Polish Airports&quot; (PPL), an independent, self-governing and self-financing entity of the national economy, replaced the state aviation administration as the manager of the airport. The company was managed under the authority of the minister responsible for communications and transport.

===Post-communist development (since 1989)===
It was only in 1990, after the fall of communism, that a new terminal started to be built at Okęcie. The main contractor was the German company Hochtief, and the work involved some 164 subcontractors, of which 121 were Polish companies. After 24 months, the new terminal was completed at the expense of some 300 million German marks. A network of multi-storey car parks and access roads was also built, and with their completion, Warsaw gained a modern terminal with a capacity of 3.5 million passengers a year. The terminal began to operate on 1 July 1992, with the first travellers to use it being those returning from Athens, Bangkok, Dubai and New York. Ten days later, the airport celebrated the first passengers departing from the new Warsaw Okęcie. In the departure hall at that time, there were 26 check-in desks; however, in subsequent years of operation, passenger traffic grew rapidly. In 1993, the airport handled nearly 2.2 million passengers, while six years later, this figure climbed to 4 million. Eventually, the decision was taken to increase the number of available check-in desks to 33, and then to 46, consequently increasing the terminal&#x27;s capacity to 6 million passengers a year.

In March 2001, Warsaw Airport was renamed in honour of the renowned Polish pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin (though this name is less popular with residents of Warsaw, and many visitors know the airport as Okęcie). A year later, a tender for the construction of a new passenger terminal at Warsaw airport was announced, this was then won by the Polish-Spanish consortium of Ferrovial Agromán, Budimex and Estudio Lamela, who joined in 2004 to implement the largest Polish investment in civil aviation history, Chopin Airport&#x27;s long-awaited &#x27;Terminal 2&#x27;. By 2006, the arrivals level of this new terminal had been inaugurated, with the departures level finally, after a long delay due to certification issues, being opened in late 2007. In this same year, the low-cost Etiuda terminal was also opened; this, however, was closed again just two years later in 2009, with all operations being transferred to terminals 1 and 2. The final and most recent developments in the airport&#x27;s history came in the period covering 2010–2011, when the airport&#x27;s new central and south piers were finished (left unfinished until the possibility of connecting them with the north pier appeared) and opened along with a redesigned terminal complex which saw the airport&#x27;s two terminals merged to form a single &#x27;Terminal A&#x27; complex. Despite this, work continues on reconstructing taxiways, ramps and access roads, the most important projects of which will see the airport connected to Poland&#x27;s expressway network via the S79 Airport Expressway and S2 Southern Warsaw Bypass. An underground railway station connected to Warsaw&#x27;s suburban rail system was opened in June 2012 in time for the UEFA Euro 2012 football championships.

As of July 2015, the airport is managed by the State Enterprise &quot;Polish Airports&quot; (PPL), which has existed since 1987 and deals with construction and operation of airports and provision of services to passengers and airlines. PPL is owned and managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, in line with the 1987 Act.

==Runways==
The airport has two intersecting runways, whose configuration and available taxiways under current rules permit 34 passenger operations (takeoffs or landings) per hour.

==Terminals==

===Overview===
In 2010, the designation of terminals had changed and the entire former Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 complex is now designated as &quot;Terminal A&quot; divided into five check-in areas (A, B, C, D, E) in two main halls. The complex contains 116 check-in desks. Additionally LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Finnair, Turkish Airlines, KLM and Air France passengers can use one of the 23 self-service check-in stands located in the Terminal. There are 45 passenger gates, 27 of which are equipped with jetways.

===South hall===
The south hall contains the check-in areas A and B (former &quot;Terminal 1&quot;) was built in 1992 with a capacity for 3.5 million passengers per year to replace the ageing complex from the Communist era. Initially, it handled all the traffic. Since 2007, the T2, a newly built terminal adjacent to T1, has been gradually taking over the major part of the traffic. Reconstruction of the south hall started on 13 September 2012. On 23 May 2015, the redesigned, reconstructed south hall was fully integrated into the &#x27;Terminal A&#x27; complex. Before its refurbishment, the south hall was very recognisable by Poles for its very characteristically dark red colour of many construction elements, including the roof that covered the departure hall, pillars, frames of doors and windows and other. In Polish, it was called &quot;buraczkowy&quot;, which simply means &quot;beetroot-coloured&quot; in English.

===North hall===
This new terminal (formerly known as &quot;Terminal 2&quot;), featuring the check-in areas C, D and E, became fully operational on 12 March 2008, two years after the originally planned opening date. The arrivals area was in operation from mid-2007 but problems with safety certification and disagreements between the airport and the construction firm delayed full operation. The new terminal is considerably larger than the older Terminal 1 and has taken over departures for all Star Alliance and Oneworld airlines and a few other carriers. August 2014 saw Chopin Airport as one of the first European airports offering free unlimited Internet access to all its passengers and visitors.
==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Warsaw–Chopin:

<doc id="636094" wikidata="Q632388" url="?curid=636094" title="Irreversible process">
<text>In science, a process that is not reversible is called irreversible. This concept arises frequently in thermodynamics. All complex natural processes are irreversible, although a phase transition at the coexistence temperature (e.g. melting of ice cubes in water) is well approximated as reversible.

In thermodynamics, a change in the thermodynamic state of a system and all of its surroundings cannot be precisely restored to its initial state by infinitesimal changes in some property of the system without expenditure of energy. A system that undergoes an irreversible process may still be capable of returning to its initial state. Because entropy is a state function, the change in entropy of the system is the same whether the process is reversible or irreversible. However, the impossibility occurs in restoring the environment to its own initial conditions. An irreversible process increases the total entropy of the system and its surroundings. The second law of thermodynamics can be used to determine whether a hypothetical process is reversible or not.

Intuitively, a process is reversible if there is no dissipation. For example, Joule expansion is irreversible because initially the system is not uniform. Initially, there is part of the system with gas in it, and part of the system with no gas. For dissipation to occur, there needs to be such a non uniformity. This is just the same as if in a system one section of the gas was hot, and the other cold. Then dissipation would occur; the temperature distribution would become uniform with no work being done, and this would be irreversible because you couldn&#x27;t add or remove heat or change the volume to return the system to its initial state. Thus, if the system is always uniform, then the process is reversible, meaning that you can return the system to its original state by either adding or removing heat, doing work on the system, or letting the system do work. As another example, to approximate the expansion in an internal combustion engine as reversible, we would be assuming that the temperature and pressure uniformly change throughout the volume after the spark. Obviously, this is not true and there is a flame front and sometimes even engine knocking. One of the reasons that Diesel engines are able to attain higher efficiency is that the combustion is much more uniform, so less energy is lost to dissipation and the process is closer to reversible.

The phenomenon of irreversibility results from the fact that if a thermodynamic system, which is any system of sufficient complexity, of interacting molecules is brought from one thermodynamic state to another, the configuration or arrangement of the atoms and molecules in the system will change in a way that is not easily predictable. Some &quot;transformation energy&quot; will be used as the molecules of the &quot;working body&quot; do work on each other when they change from one state to another. During this transformation, there will be some heat energy loss or dissipation due to intermolecular friction and collisions. This energy will not be recoverable if the process is reversed.

Many biological processes that were once thought to be reversible have been found to actually be a pairing of two irreversible processes. Whereas a single enzyme was once believed to catalyze both the forward and reverse chemical changes, research has found that two separate enzymes of similar structure are typically needed to perform what results in a pair of thermodynamically irreversible processes.

==Absolute versus statistical reversibility==

Thermodynamics defines the statistical behaviour of large numbers of entities, whose exact behavior is given by more specific laws. While the fundamental theoretical laws of physics are all time-reversible, experimentally the probability of real reversibility is low and the former state of system and surroundings is recovered only to certain extent (see: uncertainty principle). The reversibility of thermodynamics must be statistical in nature; that is, it must be merely highly unlikely, but not impossible, that a system will lower in entropy. In other words, time reversibility is fulfilled if the process happens the same way if time were to flow in reverse or the order of states in the process is reversed (the last state becomes the first and vice versa).

==History==
The German physicist Rudolf Clausius, in the 1850s, was the first to mathematically quantify the discovery of irreversibility in nature through his introduction of the concept of entropy. In his 1854 memoir &quot;On a Modified Form of the Second Fundamental Theorem in the Mechanical Theory of Heat,&quot; Clausius states:

Simply, Clausius states that it is impossible for a system to transfer heat from a cooler body to a hotter body. For example, a cup of hot coffee placed in an area of room temperature will transfer heat to its surroundings and thereby cool down with the temperature of the room slightly increasing (to ). However, that same initial cup of coffee will never absorb heat from its surroundings, causing it to grow even hotter, with the temperature of the room decreasing (to ). Therefore, the process of the coffee cooling down is irreversible unless extra energy is added to the system.

However, a paradox arose when attempting to reconcile microanalysis of a system with observations of its macrostate. Many processes are mathematically reversible in their microstate when analyzed using classical Newtonian mechanics. This paradox clearly taints microscopic explanations of macroscopic tendency towards equilibrium, such as James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s 1860 argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures of mixed gases. From 1872 to 1875, Ludwig Boltzmann reinforced the statistical explanation of this paradox in the form of Boltzmann&#x27;s entropy formula, stating that an increase of the number of possible microstates a system might be in, will increase the entropy of the system, making it less likely that the system will return to an earlier state. His formulas quantified the analysis done by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who had argued that:

Another explanation of irreversible systems was presented by French mathematician Henri Poincaré. In 1890, he published his first explanation of nonlinear dynamics, also called chaos theory. Applying chaos theory to the second law of thermodynamics, the paradox of irreversibility can be explained in the errors associated with scaling from microstates to macrostates and the degrees of freedom used when making experimental observations. Sensitivity to initial conditions relating to the system and its environment at the microstate compounds into an exhibition of irreversible characteristics within the observable, physical realm.

== Examples of irreversible processes ==
In the physical realm, many irreversible processes are present to which the inability to achieve 100% efficiency in energy transfer can be attributed. The following is a list of spontaneous events which contribute to the irreversibility of processes.
* Ageing (this claim is disputed, as aging has been demonstrated to be reversed in mice. NAD+ and telomerase have also been demonstrated to reverse ageing.)
* Death
* Time
* Heat transfer through a finite temperature difference
* Friction
* Plastic deformation
* Flow of electric current through a resistance
* Magnetization or polarization with a hysteresis
* Unrestrained expansion of fluids
* Spontaneous chemical reactions
* Spontaneous mixing of matter of varying composition/states

A Joule expansion is an example of classical thermodynamics, as it is easy to work out the resulting increase in entropy. It occurs where a volume of gas is kept in one side of a thermally isolated container (via a small partition), with the other side of the container being evacuated; the partition between the two parts of the container is then opened, and the gas fills the whole container. The internal energy of the gas remains the same, while the volume increases. The original state cannot be recovered by simply compressing the gas to its original volume, since the internal energy will be increased by this compression. The original state can only be recovered by then cooling the re-compressed system, and thereby irreversibly heating the environment. The diagram to the right applies only if the first expansion is &quot;free&quot; (Joule expansion), i.e. there can be no atmospheric pressure outside the cylinder and no weight lifted.

==Complex systems==
The difference between reversible and irreversible events has particular explanatory value in complex systems (such as living organisms, or ecosystems). According to the biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, living organisms are characterized by autopoiesis, which enables their continued existence. More primitive forms of self-organizing systems have been described by the physicist and chemist Ilya Prigogine. In the context of complex systems, events which lead to the end of certain self-organising processes, like death, extinction of a species or the collapse of a meteorological system can be considered as irreversible. Even if a clone with the same organizational principle (e.g. identical DNA-structure) could be developed, this would not mean that the former distinct system comes back into being. Events to which the self-organizing capacities of organisms, species or other complex systems can adapt, like minor injuries or changes in the physical environment are reversible. However, adaptation depends on import of negentropy into the organism, thereby increasing irreversible processes in its environment. Ecological principles, like those of sustainability and the precautionary principle can be defined with reference to the concept of reversibility.

<text>Raoul Naroll (September 10, 1920 – June 25, 1985) was a Canadian-born American anthropologist who did much to promote the methodology of cross-cultural studies.

==Early life and education==

Naroll was born in Toronto, Ontario but was raised in Los Angeles and attended UCLA at the age of 16, dropping out in his junior year to join the military.

In 1939, he joined the army serving in Infantry, as an Officer in the Army Finance Department and in the Military Intelligence Service, screening officials and prisoners of war in Germany.

After the war, Naroll returned to UCLA, receiving an A.B. in 1950, a Master&#x27;s in 1952, and his Ph.D. in history in 1953. He did fieldwork in Austria (1956) and in Greece, Switzerland and Belgium (1965–1966).

==Career==

From 1954 to 1955, Naroll was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. After, he moved to the Washington, D.C. branch of the Human Relations Area Files, Inc. (HRAF) working as a research associate where he wrote country background studies.

Naroll was a member of the faculty of the San Fernando Valley State College (later renamed California State University, Northridge) (1957–1962), Northwestern University (1962–1967), the University at Buffalo (1967–1984), and was a past president of the Human Relations Area Files.

The author of eight books, several articles and book reviews, Naroll did research in many disciplines. His first book, &quot;Data Quality Control, a new research technique; prolegomena to a cross-cultural study of culture stress,&quot; concerns the issue of trustworthiness of data and methodology used in studying cultures. Much of his later research was concerned with the application of cross-cultural anthropological theory to historical data. Texts such as &quot;Imperial Cycles and World Order (1966)&quot; and &quot;Military Deterrence in History (1974)&quot; point to Naroll&#x27;s concerns and scholarship on war and military studies. &quot;The Moral Order: An Introduction to the Human Situation (1983)&quot; is a broad, evolutionary study of ten factors of social life, from a cross-cultural perspective.

<text>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Priesthood Correlation Program (also called the Correlation Program or simply Correlation) began in 1908 as a program to reform the instruction manuals and curriculum of the different organizations of the church. Its scope quickly widened, and Correlation came to affect almost every aspect of the church, including doctrines, organizations, finances, and ordinances. A significant consequence was to centralize decision-making power in the priesthood, particularly the Quorum of the 12 Apostles. More recently, the function of the correlation department has shifted to planning and approving church publications and curriculum and keeping unorthodox information, doctrines, and other undesired concepts from being introduced or revived.

==Background and history==
In the LDS Church, all organizations and activities are intended to complement the mission of the church and are considered subject to the priesthood, helping to complete its responsibilities.

Before the correlation movement, the various organizations and auxiliaries of the church, including the Relief Society, Primary, Sunday School, welfare program, genealogy programs, and the Young Men and Young Women organizations, were largely under the direction of the stake or ward, and curriculum could vary from ward to ward. Formal organization of a Correlation Committee occurred in 1908. Starting in 1944, the Church Publications Committee approved the content and wording of the lesson materials from each of the auxiliaries, ensuring that everything published conformed to official church doctrine.

By the early 1960s, the rapid growth of the church had created administrative difficulties that needed to be addressed. Marion G. Romney gave an example of a 14-year-old boy who was invited to four swimming parties in the same week, each organized by an independent church organization. David O. McKay charged the General Priesthood Committee, led by Harold B. Lee, to form committees &quot;to correlate the instruction and curriculum of all priesthood and auxiliary organizations of the church.&quot; Under Lee, correlation quickly took on a much wider scope than just the church curriculum. For example, to bring priesthood correlation to the local level, Priesthood Home Teaching was introduced, replacing the role formerly occupied by ward teachers. Family Home Evening was also introduced. Other innovations included the calling of regional representatives, a uniform annual report from each ward starting in 1967, and further centralization and standardization of tithing in 1970. The Sunday School underwent a reorganization as well.

The changes made by Lee brought the auxiliary organizations more directly under the control of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Privately, McKay had concerns about the overreach of church correlation, referring to it as the &quot;Super Priesthood Committee&quot;. McKay&#x27;s counselors, Hugh B. Brown and N. Eldon Tanner, were worried about the correlation committee taking decision-making power away from the church&#x27;s First Presidency. However, no action was taken by McKay to change the way that Lee was running correlation.

In 1970, the process of correlation resulted in the discontinuation of the Relief Society Magazine and the Improvement Era in favor of the correlated Ensign magazine for adults and the New Era for youth. The Millennial Star, a publication for British members, and The Instructor, a Sunday School publication, were also discontinued at this time.

The present Priesthood Correlation Department was created by the direction of the First Presidency in 1972 and originally named the Internal Communications Department.

== Doctrines and structure ==

Between the 1920s and early 1960s, there was an increase in printed material available to LDS Church members, much of which contained opinions or quotes of church leaders that contradicted the evolving official positions and doctrines of the church. Additionally, historical documents surfaced, were made available, or printed from early members&#x27; diaries, which did not support the official church history. To counter this, the Correlation Committee, under the direction of the First Presidency, began to print materials and other curriculum to clarify and standardize what the church hierarchy considered to be official doctrine and history.

Another result is the block program, which standardized Sunday as the official day to hold most public church meetings. Prior to the 1980s, meetings were held throughout the week. For example, in a local ward, the Relief Society may have met on Monday mornings, Primary and choir practice on Tuesday, Young Women and Young Men on Thursday, ward activities and events on Friday, and service projects on Saturday. Because of the church&#x27;s focus on families, the Correlation Committee recommended a three-hour block of meetings on Sunday that would include a sacrament meeting, Sunday School, priesthood and Relief Society meetings, and Primary, Young Men, and Young Women classes. This would allow families to spend more time together and for parents and children to be more involved with their communities.

Additionally, due to a more centralized structure, local building funds and ward budgets were centralized by the church, easing the contributions of local members for such funds and allowing for a more equitable distribution of funds. Before this, church areas with more wealthy members tended to have better-funded buildings and activities than poorer areas.

== Results and curriculum ==
Because of the correlation program, the church generally operates the same in structure, practice, and doctrine globally. For example, members in Germany, Kenya, and Utah all generally study the same lessons and attend the same type of meetings in any given week. According to Carlos E. Asay, who served as an executive director of the Church Curriculum Department, employees use planning charts to ensure that important gospel topics are properly covered and taught at regular intervals.

Currently, there are two curriculum tracks for members: one for areas where the church is fully established in wards and stakes, and another for areas where the church is growing and smaller in number. The doctrines taught are the same; however, the emphasis on principles, church structure, and church culture is more emphasized in fledgling areas, while emphasis in established areas focuses more on the application of the principles taught.

<text>A Hebrew name is a name of Hebrew origin. In a more narrow meaning, it is a name used by Jews only in a religious context and different from an individual&#x27;s secular name for everyday use.

Names with Hebrew origins, especially those from the Hebrew Bible, are commonly used by Jews and Christians. Many are also used by Muslims, particularly those names mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an (for example, &quot;Ibrahim&quot; is a common Arabic name from the Hebrew &quot;Avraham&quot;). A typical Hebrew name can have many different forms, having been adapted to the phonologies and orthographies of many different languages.

A common practice among the Jewish diaspora is to give a Hebrew name to a child that is used in religious contexts throughout that person&#x27;s lifetime.

Not all Hebrew names are strictly Hebrew in origin; some names may have been borrowed from other ancient languages, including from Egyptian, Aramaic, Phoenician, or Canaanite.

==Names of Hebrew origin==
Hebrew names used by Jews (along with many Hebrew names used in Christendom) often come from the Tanakh, also known as the Hebrew Bible (the Christian version of which is called the Old Testament).

Many of these names are thought to have been adapted from Hebrew phrases and expressions, bestowing special meaning or the unique circumstances of birth to the one who receives that name.

Theophoric names are those which include a form of a divine name, such by adding the suffix &quot;-el&quot;, meaning &quot;God&quot;, forming names such as &quot;Michael&quot; (&quot;who is like God?&quot;) and &quot;Gabriel&quot; (&quot;man of God&quot;). Another common form of theophory is the use of the Tetragrammaton YHWH as the basis for a suffix; the most common abbreviations used by Jews are &quot;-yāh&quot;/&quot;-iyyāh&quot; and &quot;-yāhû&quot;/&quot;-iyyāhû&quot;/&quot;-ayhû&quot;, forming names such as &quot;Yəšaʻªyāhû&quot; (Isaiah), &quot;Ṣiḏqiyyāhû&quot; (Zedekiah) and &quot;Śərāyāh&quot; (Seraiah). Most Christian usage is of the shorter suffix preferred in translations of the Bible to European languages: Greek -ιας &quot;-ias&quot; and English -iah, producing names such as Τωβίας &quot;Tōbias&quot; (Tobias, Toby) instead of &quot;Tobiyyahu&quot; and Ἰερεμίας &quot;Ieremias&quot; (Jeremiah, Jeremy) instead of &quot;Yirmeyahu&quot;.

In addition to devotion to &quot;Elohim&quot; and &quot;Yahweh&quot;, names could also be sentences of praise in their own right. The name &quot;Ṭôḇiyyāhû&quot; means &quot;Good of/is the LORD&quot;.

== Names of Aramaic origin ==

Scholars of a century ago speculated that Judæo-Aramaic was the vernacular language of Israel at the time of Jesus. Archaeology is calling that into question. Aramaic does survive on a minority of first-century funeral inscriptions, and it was also the language used to write parts of the Book of Daniel, the Book of Ezra, and the entire Jewish Babylonian Talmud. Aramaic remained the lingua franca of the Middle East until the time of Islam.

Judæo-Aramaic names include &quot;ʻĂḇēḏ-nəḡô&quot;, &quot;Bar-Talmay&quot; and &quot;Tôm&quot;, as well as Bar Kochba.

==Hebrew-Greek names==
Due to the Hellenisation of the Eastern Mediterranean and the movement of Jews around the area, many Hebrew names were adapted to Greek, reinforced by the translation of the Tanakh in the Septuagint with many Hellenized names.

Many of the names in the New Testament are of Hebrew and Aramaic origin, but were adapted to the Greek by Hellenistic Christian writers such as Paul of Tarsus.

Such Hebræo-Greek names include Ἰησοῦς &quot;Iēsous&quot; (originally from &quot;Yēšûªʻ&quot;), Νῶε &quot;Nōē&quot; (originally from &quot;Nōªḥ&quot;), Ἰσαΐας &quot;Isaias&quot; (originally from &quot;Yəšaʻªyāhû&quot;), Ἰσραήλ &quot;Israēl&quot; (originally from &quot;Yiśrā’ēl&quot;).

Furthermore, some Jews of the time had Greek Gentile names themselves, such as the Christian Luke (Greek Λουκᾶς &quot;Loukas&quot;). Though used by some Jews at the time, these names are generally not associated with Jews today, and are considered characteristically Greek and largely confined to use by Christians. Hebrew forms of the names exist, but they are extremely rare.

==Hebrew-Latin names==
Many Hebrew names were adapted into Latin, some via Greek. Such names include Jesus (from Greek Ἱησοῦς &quot;Iēsous&quot;) and Maria (from Greek Μαρία &quot;Maria&quot;, itself from Μαριάμ &quot;Mariam&quot;, originally from Hebrew &quot;Miryām&quot;).

Also, some Jews during Roman times also had Latin names for themselves, such as the Christian evangelist Mark (Latin Marcus). As was the case with contemporary Jewish names of Greek origin, most of those Latin names are generally not associated with Jews today and have retained a Roman and Christian character.

== Hebrew-Arabic names ==
With the rise of Islam and the establishment of an Arab Caliphate, the Arabic language became the lingua franca of the Middle East and some parts of Berber North Africa. Islamic scripture such as the Qurʼan, however, contains many names of Hebrew origin (often via Aramaic), and there were Jewish and Christian minorities living under Arab Islamic rule. As such, many Hebrew names had been adapted to Arabic and could be found in the Arab world. Jews and Christians generally used the Arabic adaptations of those names, just as English-speaking Jews and sometimes Muslims often use anglicized versions like Joshua, rather than Yəhôšúªʼ,

While most such names are common to traditional Arabic translations of the Bible, a few differ; for instance, Arabic-speaking Christians use &quot;Yasūʻ&quot; instead of &quot;ʻĪsā&quot; for &quot;Jesus&quot;.

Such Hebræo-Arabic names include:

*ʼAyyūb أيّوب (from Hebrew &quot;ʼIyyôḇ&quot;) (Job)
*Yūsuf يوسف (from Hebrew &quot;Yôsēp̄&quot;) (Joseph)
*Dāʼūd داۇد (from Hebrew &quot;Dāwiḏ&quot;) (David)
*ʼIsmāʻīl اسماعيل (from Hebrew &quot;Yišmāʻêl&quot;) (Ishmael)
*ʼIsḥāq إسحاق (from Hebrew &quot;Yiṣḥāq&quot;) (Isaac)
*Yaʻqūb يعقوب (from Hebrew &quot;Yaʻªqōḇ&quot;) (Jacob)
*ʼĀdam آدم (from Hebrew &quot;ʼĀḏām&quot;) (Adam)
*Ḥawwāʼ حواء (from Hebrew &quot;Ḥawwāh&quot;) (Eve)

The influence of Aramaic is observable in several names, notably ʼIsḥāq (Isaac), where the Syriac form is simply &quot;Îsḥāq&quot;, contrasting with more Hebraic forms such as Yaʻqūb (Jacob).

Some of these Arabic names preserve original Hebrew pronunciations that were later changed by regular sound shifts; &quot;migdal&quot;, recorded in the New Testament as &quot;Magdal&quot;ene and in Palestinian Arabic as &quot;Majdala&quot;, which turned &quot;a&quot; in unstressed closed syllables into &quot;i&quot;.

Typically, Hebrew &quot;-ʼēl&quot; was adapted as ـايل &quot;-īl&quot;, and Hebrew &quot;-yāh&quot; as ـيا &quot;-yāʼ&quot;.

== Hebrew-English names ==
James I of England commissioned a translation of the Christian Bible from the original languages, including a translation of the Tanakh, or Old Testament, from Hebrew into English, which became known as the King James Version of the Bible and is often referred to today by the abbreviation &quot;KJV&quot;.

Even so, many KJV Old Testament names were not entirely without New Testament Greek influence. The influence mostly reflected the vowels of names and left most of the consonants largely intact and only modestly filtered to consonants of contemporary English phonology. However, all KJV names followed the Greek convention of not distinguishing between soft and &quot;dāḡeš&quot; forms of ב &quot;bêṯ&quot;. The habits resulted in multilingually-fused Hebrew-Helleno-English names, such as Judah, Isaiah and Jeremiah. Additionally, a handful of names were adapted directly from Greek without even partial translations from Hebrew, including names such as Isaac, Moses and Jesse.

Along with names from the KJV edition of the New Testament, these names constitute the large part of Hebrew names as they exist in the English-speaking world.

==Jewish usage==
A Hebrew name is used in a religious context during prayer. When deceased relatives are remembered during the Yizkor memorial service or during the El-Malei Blessing, the Hebrew name of the deceased is used along with the Hebrew name of the father. When the &quot;Misheberach&quot; (prayer for the sick) is recited, the ill person&#x27;s Hebrew name is said along with the Hebrew name of the mother. When an adult Jew is called to receive an aliyah to the Torah, they are identified with their Hebrew personal name along with their father&#x27;s Hebrew name; for example, &quot;Ya&#x27;akov ben Chaim&quot;. (In some communities, especially those who allow women the honour of receiving an aliyah, the practice is to include both parents&#x27; names in the context of an aliyah; for example, &quot;Elisheva bat Moshe v&#x27;Sarah&quot;.)

While, strictly speaking, a &quot;Hebrew name&quot; for ritual use is in the Hebrew language, it is not uncommon in some Ashkenazi communities for people to have names of Yiddish origin, or a mixed Hebrew-Yiddish name; for example, the name &quot;Simhah Bunim&quot;, where &quot;simhah&quot; means &quot;happiness&quot; in Hebrew, and &quot;Bunim&quot; is a Yiddish-language name possibly derived from the French &quot;bon nom&quot; (&quot;good name&quot;).

Converts to Judaism may choose whatever Hebrew name they like as a personal name. However, the parental names in their case are not the names of their actual parents, but rather &quot;Avraham v&#x27;Sarah&quot;, who are (as the first patriarch and matriarch of Jewish tradition) the prototypical &quot;parents&quot; in Judaism.

<text>Rubrication is the addition of text in red ink to a manuscript for emphasis. Practitioners of rubrication, so-called &quot;rubricators&quot; or &quot;rubrishers&quot;, were specialized scribes who received text from the original scribe. Rubrication was one of several steps in the medieval process of manuscript making. The term comes from the Latin , &quot;to color red&quot;, the base word being , &quot;red&quot;. The practice began in pharaonic Egypt with scribes emphasizing important text, such as headings, new parts of a narrative, etc., on papyri with red ink.

== History ==
The practice of rubrication usually entailed the addition of red headings to mark the end of one section of text and the beginning of another. Such headings were sometimes used to introduce the subject of the following section or to declare its purpose and function. Rubrication was used so often in this regard that the term &quot;rubric&quot; was commonly used as a generic term for headers of any type or color, though it technically referred only to headers to which red ink had been added. In liturgical books such as missals, red may also be used to give the actions to be performed by the celebrant or others, leaving the texts to be read in black. Important feasts in liturgical calendars were also often rubricated, and rubrication can indicate how scribes viewed the importance of different parts of their text.

Rubrication may also be used to emphasize the starting character of a canto or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than illumination, in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of gold to give the appearance of light within the text.

Quite commonly the manuscript&#x27;s initial scribe would provide notes to the rubricator in the form of annotations made in the margins of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to &quot;rubricate here&quot; or &quot;add rubric&quot;. In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of rubricator, and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe&#x27;s annotations to the rubricator can be used along with codicology to establish a manuscript&#x27;s history, or provenance.

Later medieval practitioners extended the practice of rubrication to include the use of other colors of ink besides red. Most often, alternative colors included blue and green. After the introduction of movable type printing, readers continued to expect rubrication, which might be done by hand, if there were few rubrics to add, or by a separate print using a red-ink form, later the normal method. The &quot;great majority of incunables did not issue from the press in a finished state... hardly any incunable was considered &#x27;finished&#x27; by its printer...&quot;, suggesting that hand rubrication provided a sense of legitimacy to the efforts of early printers and their works. This fact, the notion that something about hand written rubrication completes a printed work by attributing to it a sense of legitimacy and finality, is further supported by the fact that red ink &quot;was not merely decorative... red&#x27;s original function was to articulate the text by indicating such parts as headings that were so essential to the function of manuscripts that the printers had to deal with them in some way&quot;.

With the introduction of the printing press from the late medieval period on, space before paragraphs was still left for rubricators to add a pilcrow by hand. However in some circumstances, rubricators could not draw fast enough for publishers&#x27; deadlines and books would often be sold with the beginnings of the paragraphs left blank. This is how the practice of before paragraphs was created.

==Uses==
The initial scribe of a text often left notes for the rubricator of where rubrication would be necessary, usually including at least one blank line for the title alone, facts that help modern historians to establish the provenance of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.

==Ink==
The recipe for the red ink is given in Theophilus&#x27; &quot;De diversis artibus&quot;:
The process took a long time to complete, but was cheap and used common materials. The white material is lead carbonate and the red material is .

<text>Bernard MacDougall Loomer (March 5, 1912 – August 15, 1985) was an American professor and theologian. Loomer was longtime Dean of the University of Chicago Divinity School and a leading proponent of Process Theology.

==Biography==
Loomer is principally known as contributor to the study of process theology, though Loomer&#x27;s pantheism is rather at odds with the panentheism that is commonly associated with process theology. Loomer wrote “The world is God because it is the source and preserver of meaning; because the creative advance of the world in its adventure is the supreme cause to be served; because even in our desecration of our space and time within it, the world is holy ground; and because it contains and yet enshrouds the ultimate mystery inherent within existence itself. . . . The world in all the dimensions of its being is the basis for all our wonder, awe, and inquiry.” Loomer decried theological certainty and delighted in the wonder of existence: “Final answers are not to be trusted. We are born in mystery, we live in mystery, and we die in mystery.&quot;

The thinkers that perhaps had the largest influence on Loomer were Henry Nelson Wieman and Alfred North Whitehead, and yet Loomer came to believe that even these two sometimes fell into the trap of &quot;misplaced concreteness&quot; in their respective versions of theism. According to Nancy Frankenberry, Loomer&#x27;s contributions were &quot;as much by way of the art of concentrated teaching and contagious conversation as by way of his intermittent publications.&quot; Former students of Loomer include Nancy Frankenberry, John B. Cobb Jr., Catherine Keller, and Bruce Epperly.

Epperly recalls his time in Loomer&#x27;s classroom: &quot;Always wearing a white turtleneck with a pipe in his pocket, Loomer held forth. There was no telling where the class might go on any particular day. Our conversations were wide-ranging and unscripted, and we learned as much about Loomer as the “orthodoxies” of process thought.&quot;

Charles Hartshorne credited Loomer as being the originator of the term &quot;process thought&quot; as a designation for the philosophy espoused by Alfred North Whitehead and his followers. Later in life, Loomer stated that he disliked the term. &quot;If I am guilty, it was a sin of my youth, and I have spent my latter days repenting!&quot; Loomer preferred the term &quot;process/relational thought.&quot; He wrote that &quot;...the distinctive aroma of this outlook occurs when you combine the ultimacy of process with the primacy of relationships. It is really relationships that process is all about.&quot;

As Loomer continued focus on the relational aspect of his thought, he also brought repeated emphasis to what he called &quot;S-I-Z-E&quot; (always written with capital letters with dashes in between). His essay &quot;S-I-Z-E&quot; contains Loomer&#x27;s most often quoted passage:
&quot;By S-I-Z-E I mean the stature of a person&#x27;s soul, the range and depth of his love, his capacity for relationships. I mean the volume of life you can take into your being and still maintain your integrity and individuality, the intensity and variety of outlook you can entertain in the unity of your being without feeling defensive or insecure. I mean the strength of your spirit to encourage others to become freer in the development of their diversity and uniqueness. I mean the power to sustain more complex and enriching tensions. I mean the magnanimity of concern to provide conditions that enable others to increase in stature.&quot;

Another important essay was &quot;The Size of the Everlasting God,&quot; written in 1975, but published in 2013. A different essay with a similar title, &quot;The Size of God,&quot; was presented at two separate sessions (annual meetings) of the American Academy of Religion in 1978 and 1979. &quot;The Size of God,&quot; has been characterized by Frankenberry as &quot;a long, dense, and disturbing document... in which Loomer&#x27;s prose, as one commentator noted, &#x27;leans into the wind.&#x27;&quot; This essay was originally published by the American Journal of Theology and Philosophy, and later reprinted in &quot;The Size of God: The Theology of Bernard Loomer in Context,&quot; with lively responses and commentary (not all entirely supportive) from William Dean, Larry E. Axel, John Cobb, Delwin Brown, Bernard Lee, and Nancy Frankenberry. Referring to the meetings where Loomer originally presented this material, the preface to this book states, &quot;These public meetings were controversial, a condition stimulated not only by the distinctiveness of Loomer&#x27;s argument but by the way his prose leans into the wind.&quot;

In the essay, Loomer provided critical analysis of process oriented thinkers, such as Hartshorne, Whitehead, and Wieman. Frankenberry summarizes, quoting Loomer: 
&quot;God is to be identified with the totality of the world, with whatever unity the totality possesses...More concretely, God is expressed as the organic restlessness of the whole body of creation, as this drive is unequally exemplified in the several parts of this societal web.&quot; Frankenberry points out that Loomer is &quot;advancing the thesis that &#x27;an ambiguous God is of greater stature than an unambiguous God,&#x27;&quot; and in so doing is cutting against not only traditional Western religious thought, but also against much modern thought, from Kant to Niebuhr.

==Reception==

Religious historian Jerome A. Stone credits Loomer with contributing to the early thinking in the development of Religious Naturalism. Stone also notes that Loomer&#x27;s essay on &quot;Two Conceptions of Power&quot; might have been the first to distinguish between &#x27;power-over&#x27; and &#x27;power-with.&#x27; Loomer&#x27;s terms were unilateral power vs. relational power.

<text>Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an idea is understood as a basic unit of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract. Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from innovation, to development, to actualization. Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the design process, both in education and practice.

==Criticism==

The word &quot;ideation&quot; has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon, as well as being inappropriately similar to the psychiatric term for suicidal ideation.

== Methods and approaches ==
There are many methods and approaches for ideation. A list of common ideation techniques is as follows:

* Brainstorming: A technique where the basic premise is to get a group together and have them share their ideas freely, without judgement. The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible, regardless of whether they are good or bad. Once the brainstorming session is over, the group can evaluate the ideas and narrow them down to the best ones. 
* Idea mapping: This process begins with brainstorming a central idea and then developing said idea by adding related concepts and details. The result is a map or diagram that visually captures the relationships between ideas. This technique can be used individually and in groups, and it is an effective way to generate a large volume of ideas quickly. Idea mapping is often used in business, engineering, and design, where creativity is essential for success. 
* SCAMPER: SCAMPER is an acronym for the seven different aspects of ideation around which this idea revolves: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse. By considering each of these elements, in turn, it is possible to develop new ways to approach a problem or challenge and obtain a wide range of ideas suitable for further development.
* The 5 Whys technique: The 5 Whys technique is a simple yet powerful tool for driving to the root cause of a problem. The basis of the technique is to ask &quot;why&quot; five times to identify the primary causal factor behind a particular issue. It is suitable for a range of problem complexities and is often used in conjunction with other root cause analysis tools, such as fishbone diagrams and cause-and-effect tables. Although it may seem simplistic, the 5 Whys can be an invaluable tool for uncovering hidden problems and generating new ideas.
* Pugh matrix
* Morphological analysis
* 6 thinking hats
* The method of loci: The method of loci is a strategy for memorizing new information. It is a mnemonic device that involves the visualization of placing pieces of information around a room and then visualizing yourself &quot;picking the information up&quot;. This method is known as memory palace. The word loci is the plural of &quot;locus&quot;, which means location.
* Bodystorming: Bodystorming is a creative process that involves using the body to simulate various actions and explore different solutions to a problem. The term was coined by Gijs van Wulfen, who developed the process as a way to overcome the limits of traditional brainstorming. With bodystorming, participants are encouraged to physically act out possible solutions to a problem, allowing for a more immersive and realistic exploration of potential solutions. The process can be used alone or in groups, and is often used in conjunction with other ideation techniques such as role-playing and mind mapping. Bodystorming is an effective way to generate new ideas, and has been used in a variety of fields including product design, architecture, and marketing.

<text>The oriole warbler (Hypergerus atriceps) is a large warbler in the family Cisticolidae, and the only member of the genus Hypergerus. This bird is a resident breeder in west Africa from southern Senegal to Cameroon.

This skulking passerine is typically found in dense thickets usually near water. The oriole warbler builds a large untidy nest suspended from palm leaves.

These 20-cm long warblers have a long tail, strong legs and a long black bill. At a weight of around the oriole warbler may be the largest of the species-rich Cisticolidae family. Adults are light olive above, yellow below and have a black hood. The species&#x27; name refers to their resemblance to the unrelated but similarly black and yellow orioles. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller.

Like most warblers, the oriole warbler is insectivorous. The song is a loud whistled duetted &quot;toooo-ooo-eee-oooo, oooo-ooo-eee-oooo&quot;. The male always leads the duet and the female answers, though this is done in a manner that is temporally rather loose.

<text>Archdruid () is the title used by the presiding official of the Gorsedd.
The Archdruid presides over the most important ceremonies at the National Eisteddfod of Wales including the Crowning of the Bard, the award of the and the Chairing of the Bard. Although Iolo Morganwg was the first to preside over the Gorsedd when the National Eisteddfod came into being, his successor David Griffith, under the bardic name &quot;Clwydfardd&quot;, was the first to be known by the official title &quot;Archdruid&quot;.

The Archdruid&#x27;s regalia, devised by the early revivers of the eisteddfod during the early 19th century, includes a crown, a sceptre, and a breastplate in the form of a torc. These were redesigned in 1896 by Hubert von Herkomer, to be made of gold and decorated with oak leaves, symbolising the sacred groves associated with druidry. (The Welsh word for &quot;oak&quot; is &quot;derw&quot; from which &quot;druid&quot; is thought to be derived.) A special ring of office was also introduced. The current sceptre has been in use since 1910, and a stola or cape was first worn in 1911 by the Archdruid &quot;Dyfed&quot;.

Since 1932, only former winners of the Eisteddfod Crown or Chair have been qualified to become Archdruid. By the beginning of the twenty-first century Prose Medal winners were included in this elite band and the first to be elected under this ruling was Robyn Llŷn (Robyn Léwis) (2002–05). Christine James, who became Archdruid in 2013, is both the first woman and the first Welsh learner (i.e. a person not brought up with Welsh as their first language) to have held the title.

Since the Second World War, only one Archdruid has served more than one three-year term. Albert Evans-Jones (&quot;Cynan&quot;), a World War I veteran and a significant war poet, was elected in 1950 and again in 1963, and was regarded as a reforming influence on the festival; he publicly accepted that the eisteddfod and the gorsedd have no direct descent from Welsh mythology or from the druids. He was knighted in 1969 for his services to Welsh culture, the only Archdruid to have been so honoured.

<doc id="636139" wikidata="Q1244262" url="?curid=636139" title="David of Dinant">
<text>David of Dinant ( 1160 – c. 1217) was a pantheistic philosopher. He may have been a member of, or at least been influenced by, a pantheistic sect known as the Amalricians. David was condemned by the Catholic Church in 1210 for his writing of the &quot;Quaternuli&quot; (Little Notebooks), which forced him to flee Paris. When and where he died is unknown; all that can be ascertained is that he died after the year 1215, as he was condemned again in the council of 1215.

Since David&#x27;s works were banned, most of what is known of him is from the writings of his contemporaries and opponents, chiefly Albert the Great and St. Thomas Aquinas. David&#x27;s philosophy was that everything could be divided among bodies, minds, and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter (&quot;hyle&quot;); of minds or souls, intellect (&quot;nous&quot;); and of eternal substances, God (&quot;Deus&quot;). These three, matter, intellect, and God, are actually one and the same. Consequently, all things, material, intellectual, and spiritual, have one and the same essence — God.

==Life and work==
Little is known about the details of his life. It is not certain whether he was born at Dinant in Wallonia, or at Dinan in Brittany. He is believed to have lived for some time at the Roman Court under Pope Innocent III. He was a &quot;magister&quot;, or teacher, most likely at the University of Paris, and he studied the classical works of Aristotle which had been reintroduced to Europe after the Crusades. It seems likely he was especially influenced by Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. It was in Paris that his work, entitled &quot;Quaternuli&quot; (Little Notebooks), was condemned by a provincial council in 1210. The Council was headed by Peter of Corbeil, the Bishop of Sens, and ordered the body of Amalric of Chartres to be disinterred and burned, David&#x27;s writings to be burned, and forbade reading Aristotle&#x27;s works on natural philosophy. Anyone in the possession of David&#x27;s writings after Christmas was declared a heretic. This condemnation of both David and Aristotle was repeated in 1215 by a letter of Cardinal Robert Courçon, papal legate. From a work ascribed to Albert the Great, &quot;Compilatio de Novo Spiritu&quot;, in the Munich Library, we learn further that in consequence of the condemnation, David fled from France, and so escaped punishment. Besides the &quot;Quaternuli&quot;, another work entitled &quot;De Tomis, seu Divisionibus&quot; is mentioned. It is not improbable, however, that this was merely another title for the &quot;Quaternuli&quot;. The effect of the order issued by the council was to cause all the writing of David to disappear. Thus, his doctrines are derived from the assertions of his contemporaries and opponents, notably Albert the Great and St. Thomas as mentioned above.

==Theology==
From these sources we learn that David was a Pantheist. He identified God with the material substratum of all things, &quot;materia prima&quot; (prime matter). He reduced all reality to three categories, namely bodies, minds, and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter (&quot;hyle&quot;); of minds, or souls, intellect (&quot;nous&quot;); and of eternal substances, God (&quot;Deus&quot;). These three, matter, intellect, and God, are one and the same. Consequently, all things, material, intellectual, and spiritual, have one and the same essence — God. The phraseology, which must be David&#x27;s own, as well as the title above mentioned, &quot;De Tomis&quot;, suggests the influence of Johannes Scotus Eriugena. Eriugena&#x27;s work must have been widely known and read in the first decades of the thirteenth century, as is evident from many undeniable facts. Whether David was influenced also by Amalric of Chartres is a matter of debate. Albert, who was a contemporary of David, says that David merely renewed the heresy of someone known as Alexander, &quot;who taught that God and intellect and matter are one substance&quot;. It is impossible to determine whom Albert means by Alexander, &quot;a disciple of Xenophanes&quot;; probably the reference is to some Arabian work that went under the name of a Greek philosopher. There were several works of that kind current in the early part of the thirteenth century. Some critics, however, put forward the surmise that David&#x27;s immediate source was Avicebron&#x27;s &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;, or the work &quot;De Unitate&quot;, written by Archdeacon Gundisalvi of Segovia, who was well versed in Arabian philosophical literature. Whatever the source, the doctrines were pantheistic, as all authorities concur in describing them.

The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia takes a rather dim view of David&#x27;s philosophy, and considers the harsh response understandable. It says:

:((This pantheism)) of itself would justify the drastic measures to which the Council of Paris had recourse. There were, moreover, circumstances which rendered summary condemnation necessary. On the one hand the University of Paris was being made the scene of an organized attempt to foist the Arabian pantheistic interpretation of Greek philosophy on the schools of Latin Christendom. Texts, translations, and commentaries were introduced every day from Spain, in which doctrines incompatible with Christian dogma were openly taught. On the other hand, there was the popular movement in the South of France which found its principal expression in the Albigensian heresy, while in learned and ascetic communities in the North, the anti-hierarchical mysticism of the Calabrian Joachim of Floris was being combined with the more speculative pantheistic mysticism of Johannes Scotus Eriugena. In view of these conditions the condemnation of the errors of David of Dinant, the complete extirpation of the sect of Amalricians to which he apparently belonged, and the unwonted harshness of St. Thomas&#x27;s reference to him cannot be judged untimely or intemperate.

Historians have thought that the reason St. Albert and St. Thomas responded to David at all was not so much out of fear of David&#x27;s pantheism, but rather to defend Aristotle. David strongly drew on Aristotle&#x27;s thoughts on prime matter and form, and Albert and Thomas – both of whom respected Aristotle – wanted to show that Aristotle&#x27;s writings need not imply pantheism. To do this, they had to dispute David, lest the banning of Aristotle&#x27;s writings spread outside Paris.

<text>Oracle Forms is a software product for creating screens that interact with an Oracle database. It has an IDE that includes an object navigator, property sheet, and code editor that uses PL/SQL. It was originally developed to run server-side in character-mode terminal sessions. It was ported to other platforms, including Windows, to function in a client–server environment. Later versions were ported to Java where it runs in a Java EE container and can integrate with Java, and web services that can be launched from a URL. Recent versions provide a means to run the forms from a desktop computer without requiring a browser.

The primary focus of Forms is to create data entry systems that access an Oracle database.

==How it works==
Oracle Forms accesses the Oracle database and generates a screen that presents the data. The source form (*.fmb) is compiled into a platform-specific &quot;executable&quot; (*.fmx), that is run (interpreted) by the forms runtime module. The form is used to view and edit data in database-driven applications. Various GUI elements, such as buttons, menus, scrollbars, and graphics can be placed on the form. Source code may also be placed in library files (*.pll) which are compiled into library executables (*.plx) used at runtime.

The environment supplies built-in record creation, query, and update modes, each with its own default data manipulations. This minimizes the need to program common, and tedious operations, such as creating dynamic SQL, sensing changed fields, and locking rows.

As is normal with event driven interfaces, the software implements event-handling functions called triggers which are automatically invoked at critical steps in the processing of records, the receipt of keyboard strokes, and the receipt of mouse movements. Different triggers may be called before, during, and after each critical step.

Each trigger function is initially a stub, containing a default action or nothing. Programming Oracle Forms therefore generally consists of modifying the contents of these triggers in order to alter the default behavior. Some triggers, if provided by the programmer, replace the default action while others augment it.

As a result of this strategy, it is possible to create a number of default form layouts which possess complete database functionality yet contain no programmer-written code at all.

==History==
Oracle Forms is sold, and released separately from the Oracle Database. However, major releases of an Oracle database usually result in a new major version of Oracle Forms to support new features in the database.

=== Interactive Application Facility (IAF) ===
Oracle Forms started as Interactive Application Facility (IAF), which had two main components: the compiler (Interactive Application Generator - IAG) and the runtime interpreter (Interactive Application Processor - IAP). Released with the first Oracle Database version 2 (there was no version 1), IAF provided a character mode interface to allow users to enter and query data from an Oracle database.

It was renamed to Fast Forms with Oracle Database version 4 and added an additional tool to help generate a default form to edit with IAG, the form editor.

It was renamed a third time to SQL*Forms version 2 along with the Oracle 5 database version.

=== Forms 2.x ===
Forms 2.0 included a forms design editor that included a screen painter.

This release was character-based (rather than GUI) so forms were developed and runtime typically in a terminal. The source file was an *.INP ASCII file and was edited using the screen painter, however the file was an ASCII file and editing this file directly in a text editor was a common practice due to the limitations of the form editor.

This version of Forms did not include the PL/SQL language and instead it used its own custom language based on trigger steps. The language was more primitive than the PL/SQL language that was available in SQL*Plus. The limited language was augmented by user exits that compiled language code linked to the binary of the Oracle-provided run-time.

Forms 2.3 was used as the basis for the Oracle Financials accounting package. As a result, 2.3 remained in use long after Forms 3 and 4 became available in order to support customer forms that were created to integrate with Oracle Financials.

=== Forms 3.x ===
Oracle Forms 3 was the first version to allow PL/SQL to be used within Forms triggers and procedures/SQL Functions could also be used as an undocumented feature.

Forms 3 was a character mode application and was primarily used in terminals such as Digital VT220 and PCs running Microsoft DOS. It could run under X but did not support any X interface-specific features such as checkboxes, so it was basically a character mode application running in a GUI window.

Although a mouse could be used to click on fields, there were no mouse specific triggers (such as when-mouse-double click) available in this release.

The source file was an *.INP ASCII file. The runtime file was an *.FRM binary file.

The IDE was greatly improved to allow editing of PL/SQL code, and this reduced the common practice of editing the INP source file directly.

Forms 3 automatically generated Forms triggers and code to support some database constraints such as primary keys and foreign keys. Constraints could be defined, but not d in the Oracle 6 database at this time, so Oracle used Forms 3 to claim that it supported constraints in its technology stack.

=== Forms 4.0 ===
Oracle Forms version 4.0 was the first true GUI based version of the product that supported GUI elements such as checkboxes and radio groups in the Forms editor and at runtime.

Although not publicly advertised, a character-based runtime was still available for certain customers on request.

The arrival of Microsoft Windows 3 and competitive products running under Windows forced Oracle to release this GUI version of Forms for commercial reasons. Forms 4.0 accompanied Oracle database version 6 with support for Microsoft Windows and X Windows. 

A new IDE was introduced in this version. Each type of object had an editor window that was optimized for it, so the field editor looked quite different to the window editor. These would be abandoned in the next release and replaced with property sheets that were made popular with Visual Basic.

The 4.0 source files were *.FMB for forms, *.PLL for libraries and *.OLB for object libraries the 4.0 runtime files were *.FMX for forms, *.PLX for libraries. *.OLB files were compiled into the FMX.

The Oracle Financials software suite did not use this version of Forms and instead continued to use Forms 2.3.

=== Forms 4.5 ===
Oracle Forms version 4.5 was really a major release rather than a &quot;point release&quot; of 4.0 despite its &quot;.5&quot; version number. It was named 4.5 in order to meet contractual obligations to support Forms 4 for a period of time for certain clients so it could market 4.5 as being a patch to 4.0, even though a full install was required, rather than upgrading 4.0 to 4.5 with a patch.

This version contained significant functional changes and a brand-new IDE, replacing the IDE that was introduced in 4.0. It added GUI-based triggers, and provided a modern IDE with an object navigator, property sheets and code editor. This design had become popular at the time due to its use by Microsoft Visual Basic.

The development environment has changed very little since this release, so a software developer that is experienced with Forms 4.5 can easily work on any version of Forms up to the latest version.

=== Forms 5.x ===
Oracle Forms version 5 accompanied Oracle database version 7.

=== Forms 6.x ===
Forms 6 was released with Oracle 8.0 database and was re-released as Forms 6i with Oracle 8i. This version was basically Forms 4.5 with some extra wizards and bug-fixes. It included the facility to run inside a web server. A Forms Server was supplied to solve the problem of adapting Oracle Forms to a three-tier, browser-based delivery, without incurring major changes in its programmatic interface. The complex, highly interactive form interface was provided by a Java applet which communicated directly with the Forms server. However the web version did not work very well over HTTP. A fix from Forms 9i was retrofitted to later versions of 6i to address this.

The naming and numbering system applied to Oracle Forms underwent several changes due to marketing factors, without altering the essential nature of the product. The ability to code in Java, as well as PL/SQL, was added in this period.

=== Forms 9.x ===
The version number jumped straight from 6 to 9 in order to keep the number the same as the Oracle database version released at a similar time.

Forms 9i included many bug fixes to 6i and was known as a good stable version. Support was removed for Windows client-server runtime, character-based interfaces and instead the three-tier, web browser-based user interface is the only deployment option. The ability to import java classes means that it can act as a web service client.

Starting with this release the version number of Oracle Forms moving forward would keep in sync with the Oracle database version. As a result, version 8 as skipped, and the version number jumped to 9.

After this release, there were very few product changes made besides keeping the version number in sync with the Oracle database.

=== Forms 10.x ===
Forms 10g is actually Forms version 9.0.4, so is merely a rebadged Forms 9i.

=== Forms 11.x ===
Forms 11 introduced advancements such as external events, JavaScript support in Release 1, and Access Manager, Real User Experience Interaction (RUEI), and performance monitoring in Release 2. These improvements expanded functionality and interaction capabilities, utilizing Oracle AQ to enable seamless interaction with JMS.

=== Forms 12.x ===

Java Web Start allows users to run Oracle Forms applications without having a parent web browser. Although a browser may be used to initially obtain the application&#x27;s Java Web Start launcher file (.Jalp), the browser is not responsible for hosting the application and can be closed after the application has been started. JWS supports Internet Explorer, Firefox ESR, Chrome, Edge.

=== Forms 14.x ===

Forms 14.1.2.0 was released on December 20, 2024. There was no Forms 13, that version number was intentionally skipped. New features include modernised widgets and support for accessing REST data sources.

==Version Summary==

(*1) Each version of Oracle Forms can connect to numerous versions of the ORACLE database and is sold and released separately from the ORACLE Database. Oracle Forms is generally forward and backward compatible with the Oracle database - for example: Oracle Forms 9 can connect to at least Oracle 8,9, 10 and 11. The database versions listed here are the primary version that was available at the time of the Form release.

(*2) Oracle products have historically followed their own release-numbering and naming conventions. This changed with Oracle RDBMS 9i release when Oracle Corporation started to standardize Oracle Forms (and Reports and Developer) to use the same major version number as the database. This explains the jump in Oracle Forms versions from 6i to 9i (there was no v7 or v8). With the 2024 release of Forms 14, the linkage between Forms and Database versioning has been discontinued again.

==Oracle Designer==
Oracle Designer was a Computer aided software engineering (CASE) tool that was sold by Oracle. It was able to generate various software modules including Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports. The last release of Oracle Designer was in 2010 and it has since been discontinued.

==Current status==

Whilst Oracle&#x27;s preferred approach for new development is its Java based Oracle Application Development Framework or Oracle Application Express, Oracle&#x27;s development tools &quot;statement of direction&quot; is quite clear in its commitment to continuing to support Oracle Forms and continue to develop and enhance it in the following areas:

* Making the upgrade to the web and to new releases as smooth as possible
* Allowing Forms and Reports applications to take full advantage of the application server services and inter-operate with Java EE applications.
* Integrating modern mobile solutions by exposing data through other technologies like Oracle Visual Builder (Cloud) or Oracle APEX (DB) without abandon their current Oracle Forms investment.
As of January 2025, according to the Oracle Lifetime Support Policy, Premier Support for Fusion Middleware 14c (14.1.x), which includes the current version of Oracle Forms, is scheduled to conclude in December 2029. Extended Support will subsequently be available, with an end date set for December 2032. Additionally, while migration from Oracle Forms to Oracle APEX is possible within the Oracle ecosystem, as both technologies are based on Oracle Database, it is not an automatic process. Transitioning to APEX requires planning, redevelopment, and adaptation to APEX’s architecture and functionalities.

<text>Rock Follies (together with its sequel, Rock Follies of &#x27;77) is a musical drama that was shown on British television in the 1970s. The storyline follows the ups and downs of a fictional female rock band called the Little Ladies, as they struggle for recognition and success. The series stars Rula Lenska, Charlotte Cornwell and Julie Covington as the Little Ladies, with support from Emlyn Price, Beth Porter, Sue Jones-Davies, Bob Hoskins, Stephen Moore, Derek Thompson, Denis Lawson and Little Nell among others. The series was made on a small budget for Thames Television, with a style inspired by fringe theatre. It was based on an original idea by Annabel Leventon, Diane Langton and Gaye Brown. The series was a success and won three BAFTA Awards, and the soundtrack album reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. A second series with its own soundtrack album followed.

== Overview ==
The fictional band was portrayed by session musicians as well as the three lead actresses (Rula Lenska, Charlotte Cornwell and Julie Covington) who proved they could sing; the spin-off album of music from the series entered the UK Albums Chart at number one (exceptionally rare at that time). The songs were written by Andy Mackay, a founder member of Roxy Music. Lyrics and screenplay were written by Howard Schuman.

The second series, &quot;Rock Follies of &#x27;77&quot;, was a continuation of the first. Industrial action during May of that year at ITV, the commercial channel that aired the show, caused the last few episodes to be postponed until November. The second series pushed the style further in an experimental direction: where the first series had a lot of dialogue and &quot;offstage&quot; scenes, the second focused more on the music and fantasy sequences, with additional songs and musical interludes used to move the plot forward rather than relying on dialogue as the first had done. More sophisticated video effects were also used.

The show was a pioneer in that it was one of the first musical dramas in serial form and also featured all original songs and music. It was also unusual in portraying strong female central characters, and having an overtly feminist message. Some commentators have also pointed out that its format very much anticipates the age of the music video and MTV, being made at a time when the music video itself was in its infancy. The first series won a BAFTA Award in 1977 for Best Drama Series; Julie Covington was nominated for best actress, and Rod Stratfold and Alex Clarke were nominated for best design. The second series was nominated for seven BAFTA awards, winning two; for best lighting effects and for best camerawork in 1978.

The series first appeared in the United States in late 1976, when several episodes from series one were shown on New York City&#x27;s WOR-TV as part of a &quot;Thames on 9&quot; programming week. Soon afterward, the first series was shown in the United States on public television and rapidly became a hit, especially in large metropolitan centres like New York and San Francisco. However, the second series was felt to be too &quot;raunchy&quot; for the sensibilities of a public television audience, especially as the first had received a lot of complaints from the public in areas outside the larger cities for its frank portrayal of sex, drugs and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. As a result, the second series was not shown on US television until 12 years later.

Two albums of songs from the series were released. The first, named after the series, (1976), was released on Island Records in the UK and on Atlantic Records in the US in 1976. The second, covering the second series, was released on Polydor Records in both countries. Both albums were re-released on Virgin Records in 2000. The TV series is also available as a two-disc DVD set. The singles &quot;Glenn Miller is Missing&quot;, &quot;Sugar Mountain&quot; (both on Island Records in 1976); and &quot;O.K.?&quot; (on Polydor Records in 1977) were released. The last of these became a hit and reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. In addition, the second album reached No.13.

Speaking in 1991, the three stars commented on the gruelling schedule while working on the series. They stated that for each episode they had to learn a minimum of five songs, as well as perform the dance routines and learn the script itself in a short period of time. Owing to this pressure, they were reluctant to do a third series, although they did say that they would like to do another series at that time, 15 years after the first. Covington said that they were paid £225 per episode.

===Legal battle===
An eight-week legal trial in 1982 led to a landmark ruling that Thames TV had used the idea pitched verbally a few years before the show was commissioned, by, among others, Annabel Leventon, author of &quot;The Real Rock Follies: The Great Girl Band Rip-Off of 1976&quot;. The claimants received substantial damages for breach of confidence.

==The plot==
===First series===
1. &quot;The Show Business&quot;. 24 February 1976
: Three struggling actresses (Covington, Lenska, Cornwell) decide to audition for a West End-style play called &quot;Broadway Annie&quot;, a nostalgic indulgence of its director. The show flops, despite a last-ditch effort by its producer to update it and make it raunchier. The three girls, who initially do not get along and have different personalities and backgrounds, are drawn together by their shared catastrophe. The musical director of the show, Huggins (Emlyn Price) tells them they should form a rock band, with him as manager and songwriter. After some convincing, they see the possibilities, and agree. Main songs: &quot;Stairway&quot;, &quot;Broadway Annie&quot;, &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;.
2. &quot;The Little Ladies&quot;. 2 March 1976
: The band forms and starts to rehearse. Huggins seeks some financial backing from contacts he knows, but very little is forthcoming. The episode explores the home lives and relationships of the three main characters, and the widespread disapproval they face from their boyfriends (and in Dee&#x27;s case, her fellow commune members). The name &quot;The Little Ladies&quot; is meant to be ironic - the image the band tries to project is a feisty, no-nonsense female rock act. Main songs: &quot;Little Ladies&quot;, &quot;Daddy&quot;.
3. &quot;The Road&quot;. 9 March 1976
: The band goes on a tour playing pubs, clubs and dive bars around provincial Britain. The band is still raw and often fails to live up to its adopted image of no-nonsense rockers, but despite this the girls realise that playing in front of an audience gives them an incredible buzz, which makes all the travelling and lack of money worthwhile. It&#x27;s not all plain sailing, as in some venues they receive a very hostile reception. During this time, Anna has a brief affair with Huggins, Q meets Nigel (James Warwick), a freelance rock journalist, and Dee has an admirer in the form of Dave (Christopher Neil), an audience member who starts to follow the band. Main songs: &quot;On the Road&quot;, &quot;Good Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Lamplight&quot;.
4. &quot;The Talking Pictures&quot;. 16 March 1976
: After touring comes to an end, little progress has been made. The girls&#x27; various affairs create significant fallout with their established partners, and a fair amount of hypocrisy on their partners&#x27; parts is exposed. Finances are all but gone, so through a contact of Q&#x27;s, the girls end up performing in a softcore porn film. In the meantime, Q&#x27;s partner Carl (Michael J. Shannon) has gone through a huge transformation from lazy layabout to cutthroat businessman; this is due to his meeting a Greek entrepreneur, Stavros (Michael Angelis), who has decided to manufacture his surfboard design. Carl talks the girls into meeting Stavros, who he thinks may be the answer to their financial problems. Anna&#x27;s boyfriend Jack (Stephen Moore) is discovered in bed with one of Dee&#x27;s commune girls; Anna throws him out, and he joins the commune. Main songs: &quot;Talking Pictures&quot;, &quot;Hot Neon&quot;, &quot;Sugar Mountain&quot;.
5. &quot;The Pounds Sterling&quot;. 23 March 1976
: Stavros agrees to take on the girls, and they sign a contract with him. Almost immediately he changes their image to 1920s-style cabaret singers, far from their previous rock image. The girls immediately regret the decision to sign, but find they are unable to break the contract without ruining themselves. When Huggins too voices his complaints, he is sidelined; image consultants, choreographers and a new songwriter are drafted in. The girls appear as a light cabaret act at Stavros&#x27;s restaurant/club, Idols. However, the place is overflowing with pretentiousness and the public are unimpressed, staying away in droves. Main songs: &quot;Biba Nova&quot;, &quot;Rock Follies&quot;, &quot;Roller Coaster&quot;.
6. &quot;The Blitz&quot;. 30 March 1976
: Stavros decides that another radical change of image is called for: this time, a pastiche of The Andrews Sisters. The 1920s are out and the 1940s are in. He conceives of a new club/restaurant called The Blitz, which reproduces the London underground during the Second World War, complete with dishes including powdered eggs and bangers and mash, all bought with ration coupons. The girls dress as WAAF officers to sing their numbers on stage. Meanwhile, the commune is falling apart due to a power struggle between Jack and the original leader. In a heated argument, it turns out that despite the supposed socialistic ideals of the commune founder, he owns the property and is just another capitalist landlord. This revelation seals the fate of the commune, who are all disillusioned. At the opening night of The Blitz, there is a bomb threat and the evening is ruined. Shortly afterward, the bomb goes off and the premises are wrecked. Stavros blames his accountant for orchestrating it, as an insurance scam. Stavros&#x27;s empire is in ruins, and the band find themselves back at square one. Main songs: &quot;Glenn Miller is Missing&quot;, &quot;War Brides&quot;, &quot;Stairway&quot;.

===Second series===

1. &quot;The Band Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;. 4 May 1977
: The band are on another pub tour, this time without any manager. Harry Moon (Derek Thompson), a fan and songwriter, becomes the band&#x27;s new musical driving force—although now the girls are writing many of their own songs too. To make ends meet, they do a musical commercial for a range of frozen foods called &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, whose brand image is that of female liberation—though this comes in the consumerist form of microwave ready meals. Moon knows an established rock star called Stevie Streeter (Tim Curry), and arranges for the band to meet him with a view to becoming his support act. Streeter&#x27;s act is described as &quot;sub-Springsteen concept rock&quot;, but the reality is far worse. Streeter prevents the Little Ladies from getting any sound check or rehearsal time, resulting in their sounding abysmal on their opening tour night with Streeter. This turns out to be a standard tactic to avoid the support act from upstaging the main act. In the end, however, they manage to get their sound and act together on subsequent nights, and start to become a success. Streeter is worried that they are &quot;taking his energy&quot;, and in a paranoid drunken rage, tries to kick them off the tour. His management, loud American Kitty Schreiber (Beth Porter) and David Maxwell (Gregory Floy), have other ideas, and after seeing the Little Ladies live, decide to sign them up as an act in their own right. Streeter is subsequently dropped, described dismissively by Schreiber: &quot;that Jethro Tull concept crap was over five years ago&quot;. Schreiber signs the band to SM records on a standard new band contract which is far from generous. Main songs: &quot;The Band Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;, &quot;Street Signs&quot; (Streeter), &quot;Struttin&#x27; Ground&quot;, &quot;Wolf at the Door&quot;.
2. &quot;The Empire&quot;. 11 May 1977
: The newly signed band meet with Schreiber at a terrible concept restaurant called The Yankee-Doodle Club, where plans to record a single are discussed. Anna and Dee both write songs, but Dee&#x27;s pop/rock song, &quot;O.K.&quot;, is chosen over Anna&#x27;s more literary effort. Thus begins a growing rivalry between the two friends. Meanwhile, Schreiber outlines her plans to her partner at SM records, revealing her boundless ambition. The band assemble at the distinctly low-rent Galaxy Studios in Camden Town to record the single, their first time in a recording studio. They are unfamiliar with the procedure and even the terminology - someone having to explain that &quot;cans&quot; mean headphones. Q is also terrified of the ordeal ahead. After the band lay down all their tracks, it is the girls&#x27; turn to perform the vocals. There are a lot of problems getting the sound level correct in &quot;the cans&quot;, leading to an exasperating series of errors and mis-takes. In a clever sequence, as the girls finally get their act together, their private thoughts are revealed as alternative lyrics to the track they are recording. However, eventually it starts to come together and they begin to enjoy themselves. At the end of the session Anna and Q leave, and Dee is deliberately delayed. She is asked to re-record Anna&#x27;s harmonies, since they feel she is the better singer. She doesn&#x27;t like to betray her friend, but in the end reluctantly agrees. Nothing is said about this to Anna later. Anna is left to write the B-side, a song called &quot;B-side&quot;, which she performs in a fantasy sequence on a huge &#x27;SM records&#x27; logo. It is clear that the SM is meant to also indicate Servant/Master and Sadism/Masochism. Finally the single is ready, and they preview it; Anna gradually starts to notice that it is Dee doing the harmonies and not her, and begins to feel increasingly sidelined and betrayed. Main songs: &quot;O.K.&quot;, &quot;B-Side&quot;, &quot;In My Cans&quot;.
3. &quot;The Hype&quot;. 18 May 1977
: The new single is ready to be released, and Schreiber&#x27;s hype machine kicks into action. There are T-shirts, badges, caps and even a set of Little Ladies dolls. The band embark on a nationwide promotion tour by InterCity train, accompanied by various freeloaders from the music press and radio stations. In a series of interviews, the distance between the liberated ladies and the distinctly unliberated mainstream media is highlighted: one interviewer insists on repeatedly asking Dee whether she has a &quot;steady boyfriend&quot;, while other interviewers are more concerned with showing off their own grasp of the music business than actually finding out what the Little Ladies are about. The band also play a few small venues as part of the promo tour, including The Aggro Club, a venue newly dedicated to the emerging punk rock. Naturally the girls do not go down too well here. Things are not going well, but eventually they play a gig at Cardiff University, which is well received and reminds them that some gigs make the rest of the business worth it. There they meet another pub rock band, Rox and Rawls, and Dee is invited to sing an impromptu number with Rox (Sue Jones-Davies), which works out well. Dee sees Rox as a kindred spirit, getting back to the essence of what rock music is supposed to be about. Schreiber and Maxwell discuss whether the band are worth keeping on: it is a close-run thing but Schreiber decides to press on for now. Main songs: &quot;The Hype&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Roll Your Own&quot;, &quot;Round One&quot;.
4. &quot;The Loony Tunes&quot;. 22 November 1977*
: The single flops. Anna decides to try and blame this on the fact that her harmonies had been redone by Dee, something that Q had not realised. Anna writes a new song, &quot;Loose Change&quot;, and since the band &quot;owes&quot; her she is given more space to develop it and sing lead - it is very wordy and not terribly good. Meanwhile, Kitty strikes a deal with obnoxious entrepreneur Johnny Britten (Bob Hoskins) for them to become the nightly house band at the Electric Empire, Britten&#x27;s Watford club. The fact that Dee is clearly the best singer in the band becomes evident when, for Anna&#x27;s song, she performs backing vocals with Q - Kitty subsequently changes the lineup so that Dee sings the main vocal, and things sound much better. However, Anna&#x27;s ego suffers a blow and this starts to cause the beginnings of her resentment (and her paranoia). Anna hooks up with The Angel (Trevor Ward), a Jamaican, and starts to smoke dope. As the house band at the Empire, they finally start to get an appreciative audience for the music they really want to sing — rock. However, all the girls start to feel they are being manipulated by Kitty and are losing control. Dee confronts Kitty, who makes no bones about it: she has ambitions, and to fulfill them the band must adapt to her vision, or forever remain playing the pubs and clubs. Soon Kitty suggests that the band needs more power, and eventually Dee reluctantly agrees to see it her way. They decide that another main singer is needed, and Dee suggests Rox, the Welsh pub singer she met in Cardiff. Rox is brought down to discuss the idea and Kitty is impressed. For Rox, it is an opportunity for stardom, and she readily goes along with it. Rox is signed, and can&#x27;t believe her luck. Anna and Q are not involved in the discussions, and become convinced that they are to be dropped from the band. The addition of Rox comes as a complete surprise. Q is quite positive about the change, but Anna is wholly unimpressed. Main songs: &quot;The Loony Tunes&quot;, &quot;Loose Change&quot;, &quot;The Things You Have To Do&quot;, &quot;Money on the Wall&quot;.
5. &quot;The Divorce&quot;. 29 November 1977
: As Anna is drawn more toward Angel, she is also drawn more and more toward drugs. In time, this leads to total paranoia, especially wherever Rox is concerned. Although Kitty tries to pass Rox off as a balance in the vocals, Anna sees her as a threat. She tries to express this to both Dee and Q. Dee doesn&#x27;t see it that way, and Q is afraid to be the deciding vote. As her unrest grows, Anna tells the group that she wants a divorce, thereby ending the original Little Ladies. Main songs: &quot;Rock Follies of &#x27;77&quot;, &quot;Territory&quot;, &quot;Woman is Mystery&quot;.
6. &quot;The Real Life&quot;. 6 December 1977
: With Anna out of the group, Q realizes that her vocals are far too weak, especially when compared to Dee and Rox. At first she just fades into the background, but then she too decides it is time to leave the Little Ladies. At first Q goes into a deep depression, but the sudden appearance of her oft-married mother gets her back on track. Meanwhile, Dee visits Anna who, with Angel, has opened a small R&amp;B club. Anna refuses to return to the Little Ladies, and Dee is left feeling guilty about the break-up. She reasons that it was for the good of the group. Not even impending stardom and a tour of the United States (and an appearance at Madison Square Garden) assuage her guilty feelings. With Rox, the Little Ladies take off and become a sensation. Even Q, no longer with the group, is happy for them. But, just before their appearance at Madison Square Garden, Dee has a vision while singing &quot;Welcome to the Real Life&quot; where it is just her, Anna and Q — The Little Ladies. Main songs: &quot;Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Waves&quot;, &quot;Little Ladies&quot;, &quot;The Real Life&quot;.

<text>In political philosophy, the general will () is the will of the people as a whole. The term was made famous by 18th-century Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It can be considered as an early, informal predecessor to the idea of a social welfare function in social choice theory.

==Basic ideas==

The phrase &quot;general will&quot;, as Rousseau used it, occurs in Article Six of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (French: &quot;Déclaration des droits de l&#x27;Homme et du citoyen&quot;), composed in 1789 during the French Revolution:The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to contribute personally, or through their representatives, to its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, positions, and employments, according to their capacities, and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and their talents.

James Swenson writes: To my knowledge, the only time Rousseau actually uses &quot;expression of the general will&quot; is in a passage of the &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;économie politique&quot;, whose content renders it little susceptible of celebrity. [...] But it is indeed a faithful summary of his doctrine, faithful enough that commentators frequently adopt it without any hesitation. Among Rousseau&#x27;s definitions of law, the textually closest variant can be found in a passage of the &quot;Lettres écrites de la montagne&quot; summarizing the argument of &quot;Du contrat social&quot;, in which law is defined as &quot;a public and solemn declaration of the general will on an object of common interest.&quot;

As used by Rousseau, the &quot;general will&quot; is considered by some identical to the rule of law, and to Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;mens una&quot;.

The notion of the general will is wholly central to Rousseau&#x27;s theory of political legitimacy. [...] It is, however, an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion. Some commentators see it as no more than the dictatorship of the proletariat or the tyranny of the urban poor (such as may perhaps be seen in the French Revolution). Such was not Rousseau&#x27;s meaning. This is clear from the &quot;Discourse on Political Economy&quot;, where Rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass, not to require them to be sacrificed to it. He is, of course, sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others. It is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme (although not exclusive) commitment by everyone, not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place&quot;.

== Debates ==

=== Criticisms ===
Early critics of Rousseau included Benjamin Constant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hegel argued that, because it lacked any grounding in an objective ideal of reason, Rousseau&#x27;s account of the general will inevitably led to the Reign of Terror. Constant also blamed Rousseau for the excesses of the French Revolution and rejected the total subordination of the citizen-subjects to the determinations of the general will.

In 1952 Jacob Talmon characterized Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;general will&quot; as leading to a totalitarian democracy, because, Talmon argued, the state subjected its citizens to the supposedly infallible will of the majority. Another writer of the period, liberal theorist Karl Popper, also interpreted Rousseau in this way, while Bertrand Russell warned that &quot;the doctrine of general will ... made possible the mystic identification of a leader with its people, which has no need of confirmation by so mundane an apparatus as the ballot box.&quot; Other prominent critics include Isaiah Berlin who argued that Rousseau&#x27;s association of freedom with obedience to the General Will allowed totalitarian leaders to defend oppression in the name of freedom, and made Rousseau &quot;one of the most sinister and formidable enemies of liberty in the whole history of human thought.&quot;

=== Defense of Rousseau ===
Some Rousseau scholars, however, such as his biographer and editor Maurice Cranston, and Ralph Leigh, editor of Rousseau&#x27;s correspondence, do not consider Talmon&#x27;s 1950s &quot;totalitarian thesis&quot; as sustainable.

Supporters of Rousseau argued that Rousseau was not alone among republican political theorists in thinking that small, homogeneous states were best suited to maintaining the freedom of their citizens. Montesquieu and Machiavelli were also of this opinion. Furthermore, Rousseau envisioned his &quot;Social Contract&quot; as part of a projected larger work on political philosophy, which would have dealt with issues in larger states. Some of his later writings, such as his &quot;Discourse on Political Economy&quot;, his proposals for a Constitution of Poland, and his essay on maintaining perpetual peace, in which he recommends a federated European Union, gave an idea of the future direction of his thought.

His defenders also argued Rousseau is one of the great prose stylists and because of his penchant for the paradoxical effect obtained by stating something strongly and then going on to qualify or negate it, it is easy to misrepresent his ideas by taking them out of context.

Rousseau was also a great synthesizer who was deeply engaged in a dialog with his contemporaries and with the writers of the past, such as the theorists of Natural Law, Hobbes and Grotius. Like &quot;the body politic&quot;, &quot;the general will&quot; was a term of art and was not invented by Rousseau, though admittedly Rousseau did not always go out of his way to explicitly acknowledge his debt to the jurists and theologians who influenced him. Prior to Rousseau, the phrase &quot;general will&quot; referred explicitly to the general (as opposed to the particular) will or &quot;volition&quot; (as it is sometimes translated) of the Deity. It occurs in the theological writings of Malebranche, who had picked it up from Pascal, and in the writings of Malebranche&#x27;s pupil, Montesquieu, who contrasted &quot;volonté particulière&quot; and &quot;volonté générale&quot; in a secular sense in his most celebrated chapter (Chapter XI) of &quot;De L&#x27;Esprit des Lois&quot; (1748). In his &quot;Discourse on Political Economy&quot;, Rousseau explicitly credits Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; article &quot;Droit Naturel&quot; as the source of &quot;the luminous concept&quot; of the general will, of which he maintains his own thoughts are simply a development. Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau&#x27;s innovation was to use the term in a secular rather than theological sense.

==Translations of &quot;volonté générale&quot;==
A central aclaration of Rousseau (Contrat Social II, 3) about the difference between &quot;volonté de tous&quot; (will of all) and &quot;volonté génerale&quot; (general will) is this:
The following translation is correct, but with one fundamental error:
What has been translated as „decision“ – similarly translated in other English and German editions – is by Rousseau „délibère“ and „délibération“. But a deliberation is not a decision, but a consultation among people in order to reach a majority decision. Therefore, the Roman principle:

:&quot;Deliberandum est diu quod statuendum est semel.&quot;
:&quot;What is once resolved is to be long deliberated upon before.&quot;

Voting defines the opinion of the mayority and is a decision – the &quot;volonté de tous&quot; or the will of all. The &quot;volonté générale&quot; or general will is a consultation to find jointly a mayority decision. Translations which do not take into account this difference – voting without a deliberation and voting after the effort of finding a mayority agreement - lead to confused discussions about the meaning of the general will.

==Quotations==
Diderot on the General Will [emphasis added]:
EVERYTHING you conceive, everything you contemplate, will be good, great, elevated, sublime, if it accords with &quot;the general and common interest&quot;. There is no quality essential to your species apart from that which you demand from all your fellow men to ensure your happiness and theirs . . . . [D]o not ever lose sight of it, or else you will find that your comprehension of the notions of goodness, justice, humanity and virtue grow dim. Say to yourself often, “I am a man, and I have no other truly inalienable natural rights except those of humanity.” 
But, you will ask, in what does this general will reside? Where can I consult it? [...] [The answer is:] In the principles of prescribed law of all civilized nations, in the social practices of savage and barbarous peoples; in the tacit agreements obtaining amongst the enemies of mankind; and even in those two emotions — indignation and resentment — which nature has extended as far as animals to compensate for social laws and public retributions. --Denis Diderot, “&quot;Droit Naturel&quot;” article in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.
Rousseau on the General Will [emphasis added]:AS long as several men assembled together consider themselves as a single body, they have only &quot;one will&quot; which is directed towards their common preservation and general well-being. Then, all the animating forces of the state are vigorous and simple, and its principles are clear and luminous; it has no incompatible or conflicting interests; the &quot;common good&quot; makes itself so manifestly evident that only common sense is needed to discern it. Peace, unity and equality are the enemies of political sophistication. Upright and simple men are difficult to deceive precisely because of their simplicity; stratagems and clever arguments do not prevail upon them, they are not indeed subtle enough to be dupes. When we see among the happiest people in the world bands of peasants regulating the affairs of state under an oak tree, and always acting wisely, can we help feeling a certain contempt for the refinements of other nations, which employ so much skill and effort to make themselves at once illustrious and wretched?
A state thus governed needs very few laws [...]
However, when the social tie begins to slacken and the state to weaken, when particular interests begin to make themselves felt and sectional societies begin to exert an influence over the greater society, the &quot;common interest&quot; then becomes corrupted and meets opposition, voting is no longer unanimous; the general will is no longer the will of all; contradictions and disputes arise, and even the best opinion is not allowed to prevail unchallenged.&quot;For this reason the sensible rule for regulating public assemblies is one intended not so much to uphold the general will there, as to ensure that it is always questioned and always responds.
== Other influence ==
Rosseau&#x27;s conception of the general will influenced Liang Qichao, and in turn, Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s view of democracy (&quot;minquanzhuyi&quot;) in the Three Principles of the People. In prioritizing the power of the group over individual freedoms, Sun viewed traditional Chinese society as too individualistic and stated that individual liberty must be broken down so that the Chinese people could pressed together, using the metaphor of adding cement to sand.

<doc id="636148" wikidata="Q1751638" url="?curid=636148" title="Symbolic capital">
<text>In sociology and anthropology, symbolic capital can be referred to as the resources available to an individual on the basis of honor, prestige or recognition, and serves as value that one holds within a culture. A war hero, for example, may have symbolic capital in the context of running for political office.

Theorists have argued that symbolic capital accumulates primarily from the fulfillment of social obligations that are themselves embedded with potential for prestige. Much as with the accumulation of financial capital, symbolic capital is &#x27;rational&#x27; in that it can be freely converted into leveraging advantage within social and political spheres. Yet unlike financial capital, symbolic capital is not boundless, and its value may be limited or magnified by the historical context in which it was accumulated. Symbolic capital must be identified within the cultural and historical frame through which it originated in order to fully explain its influence across cultures.

Objects, as abstract representations of their environments, may also possess symbolic capital. This capital may be embedded in the built environment, or urban form of a city, as a symbolic representation of that land&#x27;s cultural value. For example, landmarks usually have symbolic value and utility. They become landmarks precisely because they have symbolic value. This reciprocal relationship provides the landmark with cultural or environmental meaning, while at the same time lending its environment a layer of prestige.

==History==

The concept of symbolic capital is grounded in the theory of conspicuous consumption, first introduced and expounded in late-19th century works by Thorstein Veblen and Marcel Mauss. Veblen argued that the nouveau riche utilized lavish displays of wealth to symbolize their entrance into a previously-insulated upper class, embodying objects with meaning that existed only to magnify and confirm their newfound class and status. Mauss subsequently expanded on this argument, suggesting that social competitions for prestige favored those who spent recklessly and forced others into &quot;the shadow of his name&quot;. Mauss&#x27; theory marked a departure from Veblen&#x27;s in that he did not seek to frame the individual actor&#x27;s actions within a cultural context; instead, his theory focused on the overarching structural implementation of status boundaries. Both of these conceptualizations, in turn, provided groundwork for Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s unifying theory of symbolic capital.

The explicit concept of symbolic capital was coined by Bourdieu, and is expanded upon in his books &quot;Distinction&quot; and, later, in &quot;Practical Reason: On the Theory of Action&quot;. Along with theories forwarded by Veblen and Mauss, &quot;symbolic capital&quot; is an extension of Max Weber&#x27;s analysis of status. Bourdieu argues that symbolic capital gains value at the cross-section of class and status, where one must not only possess but be able to appropriate objects with a perceived or concrete sense of value.

==Distinction from social capital==

Pierre Bourdieu explains social capital as the degree to which actors are capable of subsisting together in social structures that are often heterogeneous in nature. Where &quot;symbolic capital&quot; is earned on an individual basis and may fluctuate widely between members in a community, &quot;social capital&quot; is the overarching sense of trust and cooperation that actors in an environment possess in between one another. An actor may possess a great degree of symbolic capital while isolating themselves from the community, resulting in a low level of social capital, or vice versa.

The term &quot;social capital&quot; was first defined by Jane Jacobs in order to explain the inherent value formed in neighborhood relationships which allowed members to cooperate and establish a communal sense of trust. The concept itself, however, was originally articulated by L. J. Hanifan in a 1916 journal article, &quot;The Rural School Community Center&quot;, in the &quot;Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science&quot;. He included a chapter on the subject in his 1920 book, &quot;The Community Center&quot;. The term was later used by Jacobs in her influential writing on urban planning, &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;.

==Examples==

What follows is a non-exhaustive list of what may constitute symbolic capital.

* A county commission may recruit local neighborhood leaders to help with zoning laws based on those individuals&#x27; prior accomplishments in improving infrastructure or bridging ties at the community level. 
* Activists may hold more leverage in social or political arenas based on their prior experiences (see: combat veterans protesting war, former police chiefs protesting brutality, and so on). 
* Financing or supporting a nation&#x27;s war efforts may award an individual with symbolic capital should that effort also be accepted by the citizens within the culture. 
* Olympic medalists often serve as embodiments of a nation&#x27;s prestige.

<doc id="636149" wikidata="Q6116809" url="?curid=636149" title="Jackpot (British comics)">
<text>Jackpot was a British comic book magazine that ran from the issues cover dated 5 May 1979 to issue 141, 30 January 1982, when it merged with &quot;Buster&quot;.

==Publishing history==
The first issue cost 10p. The price increased to 12p from issue 63 (1980) and 14p from issue 98 in 1981

===Free Gifts===
Early issues included a cover-mounted free gift the first issue included a &quot;practical joke&quot;, for example a joke chocolate biscuit. Issue 2 featured a Squirt Ring. Issue 3 bore a Magic Numbers card game and &quot;Why Be Bored?&quot; book covers. The inner pages of the latter continued for several issue after.

===Annuals===
Annuals were printed from 1980 to 1986 - as was often the case with British titles, these hardback books outlasted the weekly comic by some time. They mixed original and reprinted material, with much of the new material being drawn by different artists than the weekly strips due to the lower page rate paid to artists.

===Summer Specials===
Summer Specials were printed from 1980 to 1982, again mixing reprint material with new strips (which again featured different artists).

==Contents==
===Initial lineup===

Source:

*&quot;Jack Pott&quot;: A one-page comic strip carried over from &quot;Cor!!&quot;, drawn by Jim Crocker. The title character was compelled to gamble on everything. The readers voted the story in the top ten for every published list - 2nd most popular strip, in issue 96 After &quot;Jackpot&quot; merged with &quot;Buster&quot; the strip continued until 22 October 1988.
*&quot;Richie Wraggs&quot;: drawn by Mike Lacey, Wraggs was on the cover of issue 1 and continued until issue 140. His best friend was a black cat called Lucky and the strip parodied elements of &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;. His character was from the country and had nowhere to live. This popular story was regularly voted into the top ten list by the readers. The 1982 &quot;Jackpot Special&quot; featured two new Richie Wraggs strips that were never printed in the issues.

<text>Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, GCB (3 December 1802 – 23 February 1887) was a Royal Navy officer who went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth.

== Naval career ==
Born the third son of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, 1st Baronet, Michael Seymour entered the Royal Navy in 1813. He was made lieutenant in 1822, commander in 1824 and was posted captain in 1826. From 1833 to 1835 he was captain of the survey ship HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;, and was wrecked in her off the coast of Chile. In 1841 he was given command of HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; and then of HMS &quot;Powerful&quot;. In 1845 he took over HMS &quot;Vindictive&quot;.

From 1851 to 1854 he was Commodore Superintendent of Devonport Dockyard. In 1854 he served under Sir Charles Napier in the Baltic during the Crimean War. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral that same year and, when the Baltic campaign was resumed in 1855 under Admiral the Hon. Richard Dundas, Seymour was second in command.

On 19 February 1856 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the East Indies and China Station. Flying his flag in HMS &quot;Calcutta&quot;, he conducted operations arising from the attack on the British coaster &quot;Arrow&quot;. During the Arrow War in China, he commanded the Battle of the Bogue in November 1856, helped destroy the Chinese fleet in the Battle of Fatshan Creek in June 1857, captured Canton in December, and in 1858 he captured the forts on the Baihe (Hai River), compelling the Chinese government to consent to the Treaty of Tientsin. He was made GCB in 1859. He sat as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Devonport from 1859 to 1863. In 1863 he was made Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, a post he held until 1866. He retired in 1870.

Seymour Road in Hong Kong Island was named after him.

== Family ==
In 1829 he married Dorothy Knighton: they had a son and three daughters. He was the uncle of Sir Edward Hobart Seymour, also a British admiral.

<text>The Sibley Guide to Birds is a reference work and field guide for the birds found in the continental United States and Canada. It is written and illustrated by ornithologist David Allen Sibley. The book provides details on 810 species of birds, with information about identification, life history, vocalizations, and geographic distribution. It contains several paintings of each species, and is critically acclaimed for including images of each bird in flight. Two regional field guides using the same material as &quot;The Sibley Guide to Birds&quot; were released in 2003, one for the western half of North American and one for the eastern half. A second, updated edition of &quot;The Sibley Guide to Birds&quot; was released in 2014.

The guide was favorably reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wilson Bulletin&quot; (now &quot;The Wilson Journal of Ornithology&quot;), and the journal &quot;Western Birds&quot;.

<doc id="636173" wikidata="Q2390763" url="?curid=636173" title="Apostasy in Judaism">
<text>Apostasy in Judaism is the rejection of Judaism and possible conversion to another religion by a Jew. The term &quot;apostasy&quot; is derived from , meaning &quot;rebellious&quot; (. translitterally &quot;Mored&quot;) Equivalent expressions for apostate in Hebrew that are used by rabbinical scholars include &quot;mumar&quot; (, literally &quot;one who is changed&quot; [out of their faith]), &quot;poshea Yisrael&quot; (, literally, &quot;transgressor of Israel&quot;), and &quot;kofer&quot; (, transliterally &quot;Koffer&quot;). Similar terms are &quot;meshumad&quot; (, lit. &quot;destroyed one&quot;), and &quot;min&quot; () or &quot;Epikoros&quot; (), which denote heresy and the negation of God and Judaism, implying atheism.

==Classes of apostates and relevance==
A &quot;mumar&quot; is someone who does not observe a certain mitzvah or who doesn&#x27;t observe any mitzvot at all. Rabbinic categories differentiate between a &quot;mumar ledavar echad&quot; (מומר לדבר אחד) who doesn&#x27;t observe a certain mitzvah, and a &quot;mumar lekhol hatorah kulah&quot; (מומר לכל התורה כולה) who doesn&#x27;t observe any of the Torah. Likewise they differentiate between a &quot;mumar l&#x27;teyavon&quot; (מומר לתיאבון) who transgresses mitzvah(s) wantonly due to craving (&quot;teyavon&quot;) or convenience, versus a &quot;mumar l&#x27;hakh`is&quot; (מומר להכעיס) meaning one who transgresses out of spite, who defies the mitzvah willfully. 

Some halakhic aspects of this status include: a &quot;mumar&quot; is treated as a gentile in regard to commerce; it is forbidden to cause them to stumble into doing something forbidden; regarding matrimony, ritual purity, and inheritance (with some exceptions) they are an Israelite; the sages prescribed no mourning for a &quot;mumar&quot;.

However today another category, &quot;tinok shenishba&quot; (&quot;captured infant&quot;), a Jew who sins as a result of having been raised without sufficient knowledge and understanding of Judaism, is widely applied and should be considered. A tinok shenishba is not halachically classified as a Mumar, regardless of how much of Halacha they observe. 

==Examples==

===In the Bible===
The first recorded reference to apostasy from Judaism is in , which states:
===In the Talmud===
In the Talmud, Elisha ben Abuyah (referred to as &quot;Acher&quot;, the &quot;Other One&quot;) is singled out as an apostate by the rabbis.

===Medieval Spain===
In Medieval Spain, a systematic conversion of Jews to Christianity took place, largely under threats and force. The apostasy of these &quot;conversos&quot; provoked the indignation of some Jews in Spain and it was made illegal to call a converso by the epithet &quot;tornadizo&quot; (renegade).

Some Spanish Jews, however, remained crypto-Jews despite being compelled to convert to Christianity (see &quot;Anusim&quot;). They are also called &quot;Marranos&quot;.

===Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank===
In 1648 Sabbatai Zevi claimed to be the Jewish Messiah. His Jewish followers were known as Sabbateans. Zevi converted to Islam in 1666. Afterwards, some of his followers willingly converted but continued to practise Sabbatean rituals. These people became known as the Dönmeh.

In the 1750s Jacob Frank claimed he was the reincarnation of Zevi and attracted many followers in Poland, known as Frankists. In 1759, with Frank&#x27;s encouragement, more than 500 Frankists were baptized as Catholics. Frank himself was also baptized, with the King of Poland as his godfather.

<doc id="636188" wikidata="Q492410" url="?curid=636188" title="Stand-up roller coaster">
<text>A stand-up roller coaster is a roller coaster where passengers aboard a train stand throughout the course of the ride. The first manufacturer to employ the format was TOGO, a Japanese company that converted two traditional roller coasters in 1982 to stand-up configurations. Arrow Dynamics followed suit in the United States the following year with their own conversion. The first roller coaster designed from the ground up as a stand-up coaster was King Cobra, built by TOGO, which opened at Kings Island in 1984. Intamin and Bolliger &amp; Mabillard (B&amp;M) have also designed stand-up models beginning in the 1990s, with the latest opening in 2023 as in SeaWorld Orlando, which was the first stand up roller coaster built since 1999&#x27;s Georgia Scorcher at Six Flags Over Georgia.

Although riders stand, they have access to a height-adjustable bicycle seat in many configurations. Older designs from the now-defunct TOGO typically used over-the-shoulder or lap-bar restraints to secure riders. B&amp;M models add a seat belt that connects the bicycle seat to the harness for additional security.

==History==
The first stand-up roller coasters in the world were originally built as sit-down roller coasters. Japanese manufacturer TOGO designed stand-up roller coasters that were first deployed in 1982 on Momonga Standing &amp; Loop Coaster, originally built in 1979 at Yomiuriland in Tokyo, Japan. The same change was also performed on Dangai at the former Thrill Valley amusement park in Gotemba, Shizuoka, Japan. Both rides added stand-up trains in 1982, with Dangai opening one day before Momonga Standing &amp; Loop Coaster.

The first stand-up roller coaster in the United States was also a former sit-down model. Screamroller at Worlds of Fun was a common corkscrew layout found at multiple parks and was built by Arrow Dynamics in 1976. In 1983, Arrow designed its own stand-up train for the attraction, and the ride was subsequently renamed ExtremeRoller after the trains were added. The original sit-down trains were reinstalled several years later. Arrow retrofitted another coaster in 1984 called River King Mine Train, which originally debuted at the grand opening of Six Flags St. Louis in 1971. Arrow added stand-up trains for the 1984 season, and the attraction was renamed Rail Blazer. The track wasn&#x27;t intended for use with stand-up trains, and a fatal accident in 1984 – involving a passenger that was ejected from her seat – prompted a recall of the trains. The original trains and name of the ride were restored in 1985.

TOGO set out to design the first ever stand-up roller coaster from the ground up and successfully tested a prototype in the parking lot of their Tokyo plant. Named Astro-Comet, the prototype was purchased by Kings Island, an amusement park in the US looking for the proper ride to celebrate the 100th anniversary of America&#x27;s first roller coaster. It opened at Kings Island in 1984 as &quot;King Cobra&quot; and operated until 2001.

In 1986, Intamin built their first stand up coaster, Shockwave at Six Flags Magic Mountain (later renamed &quot;&quot; and relocated to the now-defunct Six Flags Astroworld), which used four across seating and their new box spine track, and featured Intamin&#x27;s first vertical loop. In 2005, it was disassembled and placed in storage at Six Flags Darien Lake, where it sat until its eventual removal in 2017.

The most recent stand-up roller coaster to be manufactured (the first since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Georgia Scorcher&quot; at Six Flags Over Georgia) was SeaWorld Orlando&#x27;s surfing-themed &quot;&quot;, which opened on May 27, 2023. In addition to surfboard-designed cars, Pipeline features modernized and comfortable vest restraints and bicycle-style seats which move several inches up and down, to simulate the feelings of actually surfing. Unlike the older style, it also features two across seating and a launch.

==Design==

Three manufacturers—TOGO, Intamin and Bolliger &amp; Mabillard—have constructed multiple stand-up roller coasters. TOGO&#x27;s stand-up models feature cars that seat four passengers in two rows of two. Models from Intamin and B&amp;M also seat four riders per car, but in a single four-abreast row.

On a standard roller coaster, the rider is held in their seat by some form of harness, such as a lap bar or an over-the-shoulder restraint. As stand-up roller coasters, by their design, do not have &quot;seats,&quot; the harness system must both restrain and support the rider. Typical stand-up roller coaster harnesses are mounted on vertical posts, which allow the harness to adjust to riders of different heights. At the bottom is a seat resembling that on a bicycle, while at the top is an over-the-shoulder harness. TOGO models normally use a lap bar to further secure riders, while B&amp;M models add a seat belt to connect the bicycle seat to the shoulder harness.

With some exceptions, stand-up roller coasters normally feature at least one inversion. These inversions can include vertical loops, inclined loops, dive loops and corkscrews. Only one stand-up roller coaster, the Shockwave at Drayton Manor Theme Park in the United Kingdom, includes a zero-gravity roll.

<doc id="636189" wikidata="Q827681" url="?curid=636189" title="Aqueous humour">
<text>The aqueous humour is a transparent water-like fluid similar to blood plasma, but containing low protein concentrations. It is secreted from the ciliary body, a structure supporting the lens of the eyeball. It fills both the anterior and the posterior chambers of the eye, and is not to be confused with the vitreous humour, which is located in the space between the lens and the retina, also known as the posterior cavity or vitreous chamber. Blood cannot normally enter the eyeball.

==Structure==

===Composition===
*Amino acids: transported by ciliary muscles
*98% water
*Electrolytes (pH = 7.4 -one source gives 7.1)
**Sodium = 142.09
**Potassium = 2.2 - 4.0
**Calcium = 1.8
**Magnesium = 1.1
**Chloride = 131.6
**HCO3− = 20.15
**Phosphate = 0.62
**Osm = 304
*Ascorbic acid
*Glutathione
*Immunoglobulins

==Function==
*Maintains the intraocular pressure and inflates the globe of the eye. It is this hydrostatic pressure that keeps the eyeball in a roughly spherical shape and keeps the walls of the eyeball taut.
*Provides nutrition (e.g. amino acids and glucose) for the avascular ocular tissues; posterior cornea, trabecular meshwork, lens, and anterior vitreous. 
*May serve to transport ascorbate in the anterior segment to act as an antioxidant agent.
*Presence of immunoglobulins indicates a role in immune response to defend against pathogens.
*Provides inflation for expansion of the cornea and thus increased protection against dust, wind, pollen grains, and some pathogens.
*Contributes refraction, with a refractive index of 1.3335
*Prevents eye dryness.

===Production===
Aqueous humour is secreted into the posterior chamber by the ciliary body, specifically the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body (pars plicata). 5 alpha-dihydrocortisol, an enzyme inhibited by 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, may be involved in production of aqueous humour.

===Drainage===
Aqueous humor is continually produced by the ciliary processes and this rate of production must be balanced by an equal rate of aqueous humor drainage. Small variations in the production or outflow of aqueous humor will have a large influence on the intraocular pressure.

The drainage route for aqueous humor flow is first through the posterior chamber, then the narrow space between the anterior iris and the posterior lens (contributes to small resistance), through the pupil to enter the anterior chamber. From there, the aqueous humor exits the eye through the trabecular meshwork into Schlemm&#x27;s canal (a channel at the limbus, i.e., the joining point of the cornea and sclera, which encircles the cornea). It flows through 25–30 collector canals into the episcleral veins. The greatest resistance to aqueous flow is provided by the trabecular meshwork (esp. the juxtacanalicular part), and this is where most of the aqueous outflow occurs. The internal wall of the canal is very delicate and allows the fluid to filter due to the high pressure of the fluid within the eye.
The secondary route is the uveoscleral drainage, and is independent of the intraocular pressure, the aqueous flows through here, but to a lesser extent than through the trabecular meshwork (approx. 10% of the total drainage whereas by trabecular meshwork 90% of the total drainage).

The fluid is normally 15 mmHg (0.6 inHg) above atmospheric pressure, so when a syringe is injected the fluid flows easily. If the fluid is leaking, the hardness of the normal eye is compromised, leading to collapse and wilting of the cornea.

==Clinical significance==

Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy where retinal ganglion cells and their axons die causing a corresponding visual field defect. An important risk factor is increased intraocular pressure (pressure within the eye) either through increased production or decreased outflow of aqueous humour. Increased resistance to outflow of aqueous humour may occur due to an abnormal trabecular meshwork or due to obliteration of the meshwork resulting from injury or disease of the iris. However, increased interocular pressure is neither sufficient nor necessary for development of primary open angle glaucoma, although it is a major risk factor. Uncontrolled glaucoma typically leads to visual field loss and ultimately blindness.

Uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humour can be increased with prostaglandin agonists, while trabecular outflow is increased by M3 agonists. Fluid production can be decreased by beta blockers, alpha2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

<text>The Borough of Burnley () is a local government district with the borough status in Lancashire, England. It has an area of and a population of (), and is named after its largest town, Burnley. The borough also contains the town of Padiham along with several villages and surrounding rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Rossendale, Hyndburn, Ribble Valley, Pendle and Calderdale.

==History==
The town of Burnley had been governed by improvement commissioners from 1819. The commissioners were replaced in 1861 when the town was made a municipal borough, governed by a body formally called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Burnley&quot; but generally known as the corporation or town council. After elections, the corporation first met in January 1862 when Burnley&#x27;s first mayor was appointed. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Burnley was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it became a county borough, independent from the new Lancashire County Council.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and part of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Burnley County Borough
*Padiham Urban District
*Burnley Rural District (parishes of Briercliffe, Cliviger, Dunnockshaw, Habergham Eaves, Hapton, Ightenhill, North Town, Simonstone and Worsthorne-with-Hurstwood only, rest split between Pendle, Ribble Valley and Hyndburn)

The new district was named Burnley after the area&#x27;s largest town. It was granted borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Burnley&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1862.

The parish of North Town (which had been created in 1894 from the parts of Padiham parish outside the urban district) was abolished in 1983, being absorbed into Simonstone. Simonstone was subsequently transferred to Ribble Valley in 1987, with some adjustments to its boundaries with neighbouring areas.

In 2007 a proposal to merge Burnley with neighbouring Pendle Borough Council to form a larger unitary authority was rejected by the government.

The creation of the Burnley Bondholders scheme, an initiative which brings together local firms to promote Burnley as a place for business saw Burnley awarded an Enterprising Britain award from the UK Government in 2013, for being the &#x27;Most Enterprising Area in the UK&#x27;.

==Governance==
Burnley Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019.

The first election to the reformed borough council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Burnley. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2006 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 UK local elections the Labour Party ran a minority administration in Burnley council, having 21 seats and 2 short of a majority. However on 5 November 2023 council leader Afrasiab Anwar and ten Labour colleagues resigned from the Labour Party in protest at Keir Starmer&#x27;s refusal to demand a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. This group was subsequently known as the Burnley Independent Group. On 17 November, the council was taken over by the new &quot;Co-operative Alliance&quot;, which comprised the Burnley Independent Group, Green Party, and Liberal Democrat councillors and had enough seats to hold overall majority on Burnley Council.

Following the 2024 United Kingdom local elections, the Alliance fell one short of a majority, with only 22 councillors. Despite this, the Alliance members agreed to continue their arrangement and continue running the council, relying on the independent mayor to use his casting vote in their favour in case of a drawn vote with Labour and the Conservatives.

As of May 2024, the council&#x27;s composition is:

The ten independent councillors sit together as the &#x27;Burnley Independent Group&#x27;, which forms part of the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats and Greens. The next elections are due in 7 May 2026, where a third of seats will be up for election.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2002 the council has comprised 45 councillors representing 15 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four year term of office. Lancashire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

The wards are:
The district is represented on Lancashire County Council in six divisions: Burnley Central East, Burnley Central West, Burnley North East, Burnley South West, Burnley Rural and Padiham &amp; Burnley West.

The boundaries of the Burnley Parliamentary constituency are the same as those of the borough.

===Premises===
The council is based at Burnley Town Hall on Manchester Road, which had been completed in 1888 for the old town council. The council has additional offices nearby at the old Burnley Building Society building on Parker Lane.

==Geography==
The Borough of Burnley roughly covers the upper part of the catchment basin of the River Calder, a major tributary of the River Ribble. This includes the catchment of the River Brun, which meets the Calder in Burnley town centre, but not that of Pendle Water. The Calder has its source in the Cliviger gorge which cuts through the Pennines into Yorkshire, very close to that of the West Yorkshire river with the same name. The gorge is located in the south east of the district and separates the South Pennines to the east from the area known as the Forest of Rossendale to the south. After passing through Burnley, the Calder turns around Ighten Hill forming part of the northern boundary and exits the borough at the west once it has flowed through Padiham. The exceptions to this occur along the southern boundary. The River Irwell and its feeder Whitewell Brook both have their sources on Deerplay Moor in Cliviger. Another tributary, Limy Water begins in Dunnockshaw and supplies the Clowbridge Reservoir. All three flow south into Rossendale. Catlow Brook forms part of the northern boundary (from the Coldwell Reservoirs to Walverden Reservoir) before continuing as Walverden Water into Nelson in Pendle. The banks of the Calder on the western boundary lie approximately AOD, but the hilltops on the eastern side—also the border between Lancashire and West Yorkshire—exceed in several places. Hameldon Hill () stands in the southwest corner, forming part of the boundary with Hyndburn.

The Burnley Way, a waymarked circular footpath, visits much of the district, also passing briefly into the Calderdale district of West Yorkshire. It is considered to start/end at the Weavers&#x27; Triangle Visitor Centre at Burnley Wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

==Towns and parishes==
The borough contains eight civil parishes. The parish council of Padiham takes the style &quot;town council&quot;. The central part of the borough, roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough of Burnley, is an unparished area. The parishes are:

*Briercliffe
*Cliviger
*Dunnockshaw
*Habergham Eaves
*Hapton
*Ightenhill
*Padiham
*Worsthorne-with-Hurstwood
Padiham was also unparished from the abolition of its old urban district council in 1974 until a new parish was created in 2002, covering a similar area to the old urban district.

The council is still able nominate tenants, prioritised by need, to Calico and the other associations that provide accommodation in the borough. All have agreements stipulating that they will allocate approximately half of their vacancies to council nominees.

Burnley Council&#x27;s development control team deals with planning permission applications within the borough, subject to appeal to the Government Planning Inspectorate. The council adopted a new planning framework in July 2018, which sets out the overall development strategy for the district up to 2032.

===Museums and libraries===
The museum at Towneley Hall is owned, funded and managed by the borough council. Queen Street Mill Textile Museum is owned and operated by Lancashire County Council. Since cost-cutting measures saw a temporary closure of the site, a transfer to another operator, possibly the National Trust, is reportedly being investigated. Gawthorpe Hall on the edge of Padiham is owned by the National Trust but managed by the county council.

There are currently 2 household waste recycling centres run by Lancashire County Council in the borough. One located on Grosvenor Street in Burnley and the second on Park Road in Padiham. Lancashire County Councils long-term plans to replace the Burnley site with facility at Heasandford Industrial Estate on the north eastern edge of the town, where approved in 2010 despite local objections regarding the site&#x27;s suitability. 3 months later they then announced the closure of the Padiham site as part of cost-cutting measures, increasing the unsuitability of the new Burnley site&#x27;s location.

<text>The Viena expedition (, ) was the military expedition in March 1918 by Finnish volunteer forces in order to annex White Karelia (&quot;Vienan Karjala&quot;) from Russia. It was one of the many &quot;kinship wars&quot; (&quot;Heimosodat&quot;) fought near the newly independent Finland during the Russian Civil War. Russian East Karelia was never part of the Swedish Empire or the Grand Duchy of Finland, and was at the time mostly inhabited by Karelians. However, many advocates of a Greater Finland considered these Karelians &quot;kindred&quot; to the Finnish nation, and therefore supported Finnish annexation of Russian East Karelia.
== Northern Group ==
The expedition was made up of two groups. One group was Finnish Jäger troops led by Lieutenant Kurt Martti Wallenius. Initial operations in Northern Finland were successful and the Red Finns were forced to withdraw to Eastern Karelia. Wallenius and his light infantry crossed the border at Kuusamo, but got bogged down in fighting the Finnish Red Guards. The lackluster training and the low morale of his conscripted troops made any advance impossible, and only the eventual withdrawal of the defending Red Finns, allowed the White Finns to advance a small distance, until the troops mutinied again, as the scope of the operation had passed the state border. In the end, the force retreated back to Finland and performed only small incursions into East Karelia.

== Southern Group ==
=== Initial Operations ===

The other group was led by Lieutenant Colonel Carl Wilhelm Malm and consisted of about 350 volunteers. By 10 April, Malm&#x27;s group had advanced as far as the coastal town of Kem on the White Sea which was controlled by the Finnish Red Guard. Malm was unable to capture the town and retreated to Uhtua, where he began defending western White Sea Karelia. The Finns now switched tactics and adopted a village-by-village strategy of persuading locals to join them.

When the Finnish troops arrived in White Sea Karelia, they noticed that the population was divided. Part of the population wanted to secede from Russia and form an independent Karelia separate from Finland. However, a larger part of the population just wanted some form of autonomy. Many thought they would get autonomy as part of Bolshevist Russia. A small minority of the population wanted Karelia to be joined to the new state of Finland. Most importantly, for the great majority of the population, practical issues (such as ensuring having enough food) were more important than ideological issues. In the end, the proposal to join East Karelia to Finland received support in the White Karelian villages around Uhtua. Local Finnish White Guard (&quot;Suojeluskunta&quot;) militias were formed in over 20 villages in that area. In July, Malm was recalled to Finland and in his place Captain Toivo Kuisma was placed in charge of the Finnish troops. The Finnish government could not decide whether to recall the troops or to send reinforcements.

=== British Intervention ===
The situation became more complicated with the landing in Murmansk of 130 British Royal Marine Light Infantry on 6 March to prevent the Germans (and their Finnish allies) from gaining the White Sea coast and the Murmansk Railroad. By June 1918, an assortment of British Royal Marines, French artillerymen, part of a Serb battalion, Poles, Red Russians from the Murmansk Soviet, and some Red Finns occupied the railway line from Murmansk south as far as Kem. The arrival of British reinforcements and an Allied plan for them to link up with anti-Bolshevik units in Siberia prompted Trotsky, now at peace with the Germans, to send 3,000 Red troops northwards. In July these troops were disarmed and seen off by the British, who advanced as far south as Sorokka. British-led forces defending the railway line included a battalion of 1,400 Red Finns and the Karelian regiment also known as the &quot;Irish Karelians&quot; after Colonel P.J. Woods of the Royal Irish Rifles who raised and led the regiment.

The situation of the Viena expedition began to deteriorate. The Karelian regiment stationed in Kem attacked the Finnish troops at Jyskyjärvi on 27 August. 18 men were lost. The next attack came against Luusalmi on 8 September when 42 Finns were killed. Subsequent battles were fought at Kostamus and Vuokkiniemi in September–October. The Finnish troops withdrew to Finland on 2 October. Of these troops, 195 survived and made their way home; 83 were killed. The British forces withdrew in October 1919 and the situation of the Russian White Army collapsed.

== Outcome ==

In the end, the expedition failed due to lack of decisive support by both the Finnish government, who was reluctant to escalate, and the local Finnish population, who distrusted the Whites. Conversely, British forces in the region instilled a sense of nationalism to fight against the Finnish effort to annex East Karelia. Also the support of the expedition from the Finnish government waned with the fortunes of the Germans. After the Viena expedition, the parishes of Repola and Porajärvi in East Karelia had held a vote to join Finland, but Finland gave up all claims to East Karelia in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu.

Two years later, after the last of the British expeditionary forces had left Russia and Bolshevik control was established, a group of Karelian irredentia supported by Finnish volunteers began an uprising in an attempt to form their own state.

<doc id="636198" wikidata="Q749372" url="?curid=636198" title="Rurrenabaque">
<text>Rurrenabaque is a small town in the north of Bolivia, on the Beni River. It is the capital of Rurrenabaque Municipality. In recent years, it has become popular with international tourism as it is an easy gateway for visits to Madidi National Park, which is within the Bolivian rainforest. It also provides access to the surrounding pampas. Locals commonly refer to the town by its shortened nickname, &quot;Rurre.&quot;

Rurrenabaque is located in José Ballivián Province in Beni Department, Bolivia. Rurrenabaque Municipality, the fourth municipal section of José Ballivián Province, had 19,195 inhabitants as of 2012, of which 13,446 lived in urban Rurrenabaque itself.

==Transportation==

Rurrenabaque is reached by bus, from La Paz (18 hours), by hired taxi (12 hours), or by airplane (45 minutes to 1 hour). Ecojet offers flights to Rurrenabaque.

The buses from La Paz pass through Coroico, from La Paz.
A new road on this route opened at the end of 2006, decreasing most motorized traffic on the older, more dangerous Yungas Road, also known as &#x27;Death Road,&#x27; now highly popular for mountain bike tours.

Rurrenabaque Airport was paved in 2010. Sometimes, low clouds over nearby mountains can hinder planes&#x27; visibility and prevent them from landing.

A nearby airport can also be used, Reyes Airport, which is away and about one hour by bus. There are no mountains near Reyes, and the airport often has better weather and fewer low clouds. Reyes is the capital of José Ballivián Province in the Beni Department.

Rurrenabaque lies on the east bank of the Beni River. A bridge over the Beni River connects with the town of San Buenaventura on the west bank. The bridge is a part of a regional road project promoted as a way to improve the economic relationship between the two towns, which had been described as stunted because of limited and expensive transport by boat. An argument in favor of the proposed bridge is that the shallows and strong currents at the San Buenaventura section limit the types of boats and motors capable of crossing the stretch of river, representing an investment beyond the means of most individual Bolivian families. A bridge would allow San Buenaventura to enjoy the same accessibility as that enjoyed between Rurrenabaque and the neighboring town of Reyes. Researchers cite economic and social harm for the area because of environmental damage from the road project and the location of the bridge, which may reduce the town&#x27;s appeal as a destination or gateway for eco-tourists.

==Climate==

Rurrenabaque sits on the Beni River as the waterway exits the Andean folds of western Bolivia into the Llanos de Moxos. The city has a tropical rainforest climate, bordering on a tropical monsoon climate with a noticeably drier part of the year. Rurrenabaque, like much of Bolivia, is subject to annual climactic variation, particularly as a result of climate change.

==Tourism==

From Rurrenabaque, popular tours go to the jungle or rainforest (&quot;selva&quot; in Spanish) and to the pampas. The jungle or rainforest is south and west of Rurrenabaque (including a part of Madidi National Park), and the tours leave by boat and foot. There are many tour agencies in the town offering similar tours.

Rurrenabaque is a starting point for ecotourism, and some eco-lodges are found in the area. The following is a list of the community-based Eco-Lodges-: Mashaquipe; San Louis Grande (Mosetén); Berraco del Madidi (Quechua-Tacanas); San Miguel del Bala (Tacanas); Chalalán (Quechua-Tacanas); Mapajo (Tsiman-Mosetén).

Events, festivities: 2 February: Fiesta de Rurre - Anniversary of Rurrenabaque - The day of La Virgen de Candelaria.

<text>Leonhard Hess Stejneger (30 October 1851 – 28 February 1943) was a Norwegian-born American ornithologist, herpetologist and zoologist. Stejneger specialized in vertebrate natural history studies. He gained his greatest reputation with reptiles and amphibians.

==Early life and family==

Stejneger was born in Bergen, Norway. His father was Peter Stamer Steineger, a merchant and auditor; his mother was Ingeborg Catharine (née Hess). Leonhard was the eldest of seven children. His sister Agnes Steineger was a Norwegian artist. Until 1880, the Steineger family had been one of the wealthy families in Bergen; at that time business reverses led to the father declaring bankruptcy.

Stejneger attended the Smith Theological School in Bergen from 1859 to 1860, and Bergen Latin School until 1869. His interests in zoology developed early. By age sixteen, he had a printed catalogue of birds, and he painted birds in water color. He moved with his mother to Meran in South Tyrol and studied under a private tutor. Around 1870, he began to spell his surname &quot;Stejneger&quot; and continued to use that spelling for the rest of his life. He studied law and philosophy at the University of Christiania. He earned a Ph.D. and started a brief career as a lawyer.

==Career==
In 1880, Stejneger ordered a walking cane with a built-in collector&#x27;s gun which would serve him in his specimen collection until the end of his life. In 1881, Stejneger moved to the United States on the advice of Jean Cabanis. He had married Anna Norman in 1876 but she chose not to move to the United States and they separated and later divorced. On arriving in the US, he immediately went to the Smithsonian Institution to meet Spencer Fullerton Baird after taking some time sitting in a park to brush up on his English vocabulary. Baird had been in communication and knew his competence and he began to work soon after. Stejneger became an American citizen in 1887. Stejneger participated in numerous expeditions to the northern parts of the North American continent. From 1882 to 1883, he was on an exploration mission to Bering Island and Kamchatka. In 1895, he went to the Commander Islands, studying fur seals for the U.S. Fish Commission. He returned there a second time in 1922.

Within the Smithsonian Institution, he moved up the career ladder. In 1884 he was Assistant Curator for birds, in 1889 Curator for reptiles, in 1899 Curator for reptiles and amphibians, and from 1911 on Head Curator for biology, a post he held until his death, having been exempted from retirement by a presidential decree.

Stejneger published more than 400 scientific works on birds, reptiles, seals, the herpetology of Puerto Rico, and other topics.

During his Bering Island trip, he became fascinated by the life of Georg Wilhelm Steller, an 18th-century naturalist who had previously visited there. He thoroughly researched Steller&#x27;s life over the next few decades, a hobby which culminated in his only non-scientific publication, an authoritative Steller biography published in 1936.

Stejneger was a Life Member of the Bergen Museum. He attended the International Congresses of Zoology of 1898, 1901, 1904, 1907, 1913, 1927, and 1930, as well as ornithological and fisheries congresses. He was elected to the International Committee on Zoological Nomenclature in 1898 and served as the organizing secretary for the Section on Zoogeography at the 1907 International Zoological Congress (VII) in Boston. In 1900, he was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exposition for his work on fur seals management and conservation. In 1923, Stejneger was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1931, he was made honorary president for life of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists. In 1906, he was made knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olaf and then in 1939 Commander of the same order.

==Legacy==

Stejneger is commemorated in the scientific names of 13 reptiles (ten species and three subspecies): &quot;Amphisbaena stejnegeri, Aspidoscelis tigris stejnegeri, Crotalus stejnegeri, Gloydius intermedius stejnegeri, Hemidactylus stejnegeri, Pseudoxenodon stejnegeri, Rhinotyphlops stejnegeri, Sceloporus stejnegeri, Sphaerodactylus cinereus stejnegeri, Takydromus stejnegeri, Trachemys stejnegeri, Trimeresurus stejnegeri&quot;, and &quot;Uta stansburiana stejnegeri&quot;. He is also commemorated in several bird species including &quot;Mellanitta stejnegeri&quot; and &quot;Saxicola stejnegeri&quot;.

<doc id="636208" wikidata="Q1999471" url="?curid=636208" title="President of the Confederate States of America">
<text>The President of the Confederate States was the head of state and head of government of the unrecognized breakaway Confederate States. The president was the chief executive of the federal government and commander-in-chief of the Confederate Army and Navy.

Article II of the Constitution of the Confederate States vested executive power of the Confederacy in the president. The power included execution of law, along with responsibility for appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. He was further empowered to grant reprieves and pardons, and convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances.

The President was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the vice president. On February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis became president of the provisional government, as well as the only person to assume the position. On February 22, 1862, he became president of the permanent government and served in that capacity until the Confederacy&#x27;s military collapse. The Confederate States cabinet declared the Confederacy dissolved May 5, 1865, after which Davis stopped attempting to exercise his office&#x27;s powers and duties. May 5 is therefore generally considered to be the day the Confederate States of America (and its presidency) were formally abolished. Davis himself was captured by elements of the United States Cavalry five days later.

==Powers and duties==
The constitutional powers of the president of the Confederate States were similar to those of the president of the United States. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army, Navy, and militia of the confederated states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. During a Senate recess, he could fill vacancies but not reappoint persons previously rejected by the Senate. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.

==Election and oath==
On February 9, 1861, the provisional congress at Montgomery unanimously elected Jefferson Davis president and Alexander H. Stephens vice president. Stephens, who was a delegate to Congress from Georgia, was inaugurated on February 11. Davis was inaugurated on February 18 upon his arrival from Mississippi, where he had gone upon his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Confederate presidents were to be limited to a single term. Davis and Stephens were elected on Wednesday November 6, 1861 for six-years terms, as provided by the permanent constitution. The capital had been moved in June 1861 to Richmond and the inauguration took place at the statue of Washington on Capitol Square on February 22, 1862.

Before Davis entered on the execution of his office as President of the Confederate States, he was constitutionally required to take the following oath or affirmation:

==Compensation==
In 1861, the president of the Confederate States earned a CS$25,000 annual salary, along with an expense account, and a nontaxable travel account. The President&#x27;s Office was located on the second floor of the Custom House on Main Street, a structure which also housed the Cabinet Room and the State and Treasury Departments. The City of Richmond purchased the White House of the Confederacy (Brockenbrough House) for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift, but the mansion was leased for his use. Referred to as the &quot;White House of the Confederacy&quot; or the &quot;Grey House,&quot; the mansion was used by Davis until Richmond fell to the Union Army in early April 1865. The residence later became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum.

===Notes===
==Office of the Confederate President==
As of 1864, Davis had a private secretary, Burton N. Harrison, of Mississippi, and five aides-de-camp: Col. William M. Browne of Georgia, Col. James Chestnut of South Carolina, Col. William P. Johnston of Kentucky, Col. G. W. C. Lee of Virginia, and Col. John T. Wood.

<text>Cosmic Encounter is a science fiction–themed strategy board game designed by &quot;Future Pastimes&quot; (collectively, Peter Olotka, Jack Kittredge and Bill Eberle, with Bill Norton) and originally published by Eon Games in 1977. In it, each player takes the role of a particular alien species, each with a unique power to bend or break one of the rules of the game, trying to establish control over the universe. The game was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame in 1997.

&quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; is a dynamic and social game, with players being encouraged to interact, argue, form alliances, make deals, double-cross, and occasionally work together to protect the common good. Most editions of the game are designed for three to five players, although official rules exist for playing with as many as eight players.

==Gameplay==
===Basic rules===
&quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; is based on a fixed set of rules which are subsequently modified by other elements of the game.

Each player begins with a color-coded &quot;home system&quot; containing five planets, and twenty ships (formerly referred to as &quot;tokens&quot;) representing starships that populate these planets as &quot;colonies&quot; (formerly known as &quot;bases&quot;). A central &quot;warp&quot; is used to place defeated ships for all players. The object of the game is to establish colonies on five planets outside one&#x27;s home system. Each player is dealt a hand of cards from the &quot;cosmic deck,&quot; which includes several types of cards: Attack cards with numbered values, Negotiate (formerly Compromise) cards, Reinforcement cards, and Artifact (formerly Edict) cards.

The turn player is referred to as the &quot;offense.&quot; On a player&#x27;s turn, they retrieve one ship from the warp, and then draw a card from the &quot;Destiny&quot; deck, containing color-coded cards which indicate which player they must have an encounter with; that player becomes the &quot;defense.&quot; Using a special &quot;hyperspace gate&quot; (formerly &quot;hyperspace cone&quot; or simply &quot;cone&quot;) indicator, the offense selects the planet at which the encounter will take place, and then places 1 to 4 of their ships on the gate; the defense simply defends with however many ships they have on the targeted planet. Both the offense and defense can then ask the other players individually to ally with their side; each invited player may commit up to 4 ships to either side of the conflict.

Once allies have committed, the offense and defense both select encounter cards from their hands to place face-down, then reveal them and play out the encounter based on the types of cards they used.
* If players use Attack cards, the total of the card&#x27;s value and number of allied ships are added for both sides, and the side with the larger value wins, with the defending player winning in case of ties. All players involved in the encounter may play Reinforcement cards from their hands to add numerical bonuses to each side&#x27;s forces. If the offense&#x27;s side wins, the defense&#x27;s colony is lost and all ships on the defense&#x27;s side are sent to the warp, and the offense and their allies land their ships on that planet, establishing new colonies on it (or adding more ships to existing colonies there, if they already had colonies there). If the defense&#x27;s side wins, all ships on the offense&#x27;s side are sent to the warp, and defensive allies gain a reward of either a ship from the warp or a new card drawn from the deck for each of their ships that they sent to help defend. 
* If both players use Negotiate cards, they have one minute to make a deal, such as exchanging colonies or cards from their hands, while all allies are sent back to their owners&#x27; colonies (allies get nothing in this situation). If a deal can&#x27;t be made, both players lose three ships each as a penalty.
* If one players plays a Negotiate card and the other plays an Attack card, the player who played the Negotiate card immediately loses, but they get &quot;compensation&quot; from the victor by drawing cards from the victor&#x27;s hand equal to the number of ships they lost in the battle. Allies on the Negotiate player&#x27;s side do not get anything.

At the end of the offense&#x27;s turn, they may have a second encounter if they won an attack or made a deal. If they can&#x27;t, choose not to, or have already had two encounters this turn, then play proceeds to the next player.

===Alien powers===
The rules become more complex with the introduction of alien powers. These are typically drawn randomly at the start of the game and known to all players; however, variants exist where players can select their powers, use multiple powers simultaneously, or hide their powers until they are used. Each power gives the player a way to bend the core rules to their advantages, typically in one of the following ways:
* Continuous effects, such as the Macron, where each of its ships is valued as 4 instead of 1 during combat
* Combat resolution effects, such as the Void, where any ship that loses against it is removed from the game entirely instead of going to the warp
* Victory condition changes, such as Masochist, who wins if it loses all its ships
* Role-playing elements, such as the Sniveler, who, if in a losing position, may whine to the other players to gain benefits
A player&#x27;s alien power is only active if they have three or more colonies in their home system, and if lost, can be regained by taking back a third colony.

The current edition of &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot;, published by Fantasy Flight Games, includes a total of 238 aliens across all of its expansion and promo sets. In addition, many players have created their own &quot;homemade&quot; powers, and have posted these along with other various game extensions on the Internet.

===Variants===
More advanced optional game components can add further levels of complexity and unpredictability. Various editions have included varying numbers of these optional components. They include:
*Flares: Cards that grant a limited version of an alien power, or, if used by the player who possesses that power, a significant boost to their own power.
*Lux (formerly Lucre): In-game currency that allows more control of resources (such as buying more cards for one&#x27;s hand or ships back from the warp).
*Moons: Special tokens which may be occupied by players, doing so grants one access to its special ability. Moon abilities can be powerful (such as retaining an alien power when it would normally be lost), while others are best described as &quot;silly&quot; (such as forcing the owner to speak in rhyme).
*Special planetary systems: Added in an expansion to the Eon Productions version of &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; and kept in the Mayfair version, the special systems have additional rules in regards to the player&#x27;s initial setup, colonies, and victory conditions.
*Technologies: An array of boosts and special abilities, which must be researched (by placing ships on them) for several turns before they can be put into play. The power of technology cards varies wildly, with more powerful technologies requiring more turns to research. For example, the Xenon Lasers tech costs two ships, and its owner may change encounter totals by one point, while the Omega Missile tech costs eight ships, and destroys a planet.
*Rewards: A deck of powerful cards that can only be drawn by victorious defensive allies. Reward cards include &quot;kickers,&quot; multipliers for encounter cards, and &quot;rifts,&quot; booby traps that free ships from the warp, or send ships there if they are ever taken from another player&#x27;s hand.
*Large group games: Official variants include rules and cards for adding a seventh or eighth player. However, with unofficial variants, the game can support as many players as the number of available player colors. With all expansions, the Mayfair Games edition has ten player colors for a ten-player game and Fantasy Flight Games&#x27; edition has eight player colors for an eight-player game, or up to 13 player colors if the translucent plastic ships from the 42nd Anniversary Edition are each included as their own color.

== History ==
The original version of &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; had exactly six alien powers and was designed for up to six players. This edition was nearly published by Parker Brothers in the mid-1970s; when it was not, the designers founded Eon Productions, Inc. to publish it.

The first Eon edition was released in 1977. It allowed up to four players and included fifteen alien powers. Over the next five years, Eon released nine expansions, adding sixty more alien powers, components for a fifth and sixth player, and several new types of pieces, including &quot;Flare&quot; cards, money (Lucre), Moons, and special power planet systems. The artwork on these early editions included images painted by Dean Morrissey. Eon published three versions of the base game, differing only in box size and cover art.
In 1986, the game was republished in the U.S. by West End Games. The game used the same deck of cards and number of players, and the same powers with five additional powers from Eon expansion sets #1 and #2. However, the cards and tokens were incompatible with the Eon edition. Meanwhile, in the UK, the game was published by Games Workshop. The GW edition supported six players, with powers from the Eon base set and some of the first three expansions.

In 1991, the game was licensed by Mayfair Games. Mayfair published &quot;Cosmic Encounter,&quot; an expansion called &quot;More Cosmic Encounter&quot; (1992), and a stripped-down introductory version of the game called &quot;Simply Cosmic&quot; (1995). The Mayfair edition revised some powers from the original Eon set, introduced many more, and significantly revised some of the existing components. It also introduced several new components. By combining the three Mayfair products, it is possible to play a 10-player game.

In 2000, Avalon Hill (by then a division of Hasbro) published a simplified version in one box with plastic pieces. While the production quality was high, this version was limited to 20 powers and four players and received no expansions.

On August 17, 2007, Fantasy Flight Games announced plans to reprint the game in 2008. Game designer Kevin Wilson gave demonstrations of Fantasy Flight&#x27;s Cosmic Encounter version at Gen Con 2008, and the game was released in December. This edition included 50 aliens, flare cards, a new Technology variant, and support for 5 players. Since 2008, Fantasy Flight has released seven expansion sets:

Each set of aliens includes those aliens&#x27; alien sheets and flare cards, along with any special tokens certain aliens may need. An extra player includes 20 ships, 5 planets, a colony marker, and destiny cards of the corresponding color.

In 2018, a special 42nd-anniversary edition was released by Fantasy Flight, with new box art, translucent ships, a new alien (the Demon), and a few other minor features. The new edition is still compatible with Fantasy Flight&#x27;s expansions.

In 2022, Fantasy Flight published the seventh expansion for the game: Cosmic Odyssey, designed by Jack Reda, which adds a campaign mode, expands on variant from the previous expansions, and includes several new variants (some of which are reimagined versions of variants from previous editions). 

A standalone two-player adaptation of the game was released in 2020. Titled &quot;Cosmic Encounter Duel&quot;, it still features a race to colonize five planets through attacks and negotiations. However, it replaces the standard game&#x27;s multiplayer alliance system with virtual allies called Envoys, and increases the degree of hidden information in an encounter through methods such as giving the players rotating dials with which to secretly choose their fleet strengths.

===Online version===
In 2003, original designer Peter Olotka and partners launched a new version called &quot;Cosmic Encounter Online&quot; that could be played over the internet. , this version had 35 powers, including four new aliens and two more that were designed for online play (such as Dork, which blocks other players&#x27; screens).

&quot;Cosmic Encounter Online&quot; has since been shut down. It has been superseded by &quot;Cosmic Encounter Connector&quot;, released in 2015 and available through Tabletop Simulator.

==Reception==
===First Eon edition (1977) and subsequent expansion sets (1978–1982)===
In the May 1978 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 14), Tony Watson found the game to be &quot;highly playable, fanciful, and very fun.&quot; Watson liked the professional quality of the game components, and admired the complex player strategies that were not immediately apparent upon reading the rules. He concluded, &quot;&quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; is a new type of SF game... and it hits it mark quite squarely. From both a physical and design point of view it is a very good game.&quot;

In the June–July 1978 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue 7), Fred Hemmings found the game &quot;simple to learn, and yet at the same time is so full of good ideas and potential player skill.&quot; Hemmings admired the &quot;beautifully produced&quot; game components, but wished that there was more than one winning objective — although he did note that using the two available expansions resulted in 35 alien races to choose from, giving a potential for more than a million combinations. He gave the game an overall rating of 8 out of 10, saying, &quot;What makes this game is the aliens —they vary from good to excellent, and so does the game.&quot;

In the September 1978 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 18), Dave Minch questioned the science fiction angle of &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot;, saying it was &quot;nothing more than hype.&quot; When Minch delved below the SF &quot;patina&quot;, he found a game that &quot;combines several elements of classic, abstract games. There are cards which introduce both chance and strategy of play, as in poker or bridge. There are chips representing the
bases which you must build to win the game, giving the positional and matching requirements of pit-and-pebble games, as well as a betting flavor like poker.&quot; Minch concluded with a recommendation, saying, &quot;This is a simple game both to learn and to play. Best of all, it’s fun and pretty much open-ended.&quot;

In the inaugural edition of &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; (March 1980), Greg Costikyan rated the game 9 out of 9, saying, &quot;The result is a weird, constantly mutating, and gripping game that does not lose its appeal even after innumerable playings. The addition of any of the four expansion sets makes &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; even more fascinating.&quot;

In the March 1981 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (No. 37) Steve Jackson gave a thumbs up, saying, &quot;I like &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot;. It&#x27;s totally original, and a lot of fun. I recommend it without reservation to gamers&quot;.

In the October 1981 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (No. 44), Forrest Johnson thought the continued publication of expansion sets (six to that point in time) was perhaps an indication that the game was losing replay value: &quot;Expansion sets 1 and 2 would be more valuable to a new player; Eon Products is approaching the point of diminishing returns. But sets 6 and 7 still have a lot of value for CE enthusiasts.&quot;

===West End Games and Games Workshop editions (1986)===
In the March 1986 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue 75), Tim Wilson gave the re-issued game an overall rating of 8 out of 10, saying, &quot;&quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; is an easy, light-hearted game with plenty of scope for devious strategy and backstabbing... The earlier version of this game [published by Eon] proved too scarce and expensive for it to become well-known: try it now, and see why it was worth re-releasing.&quot;

===Mayfair Games edition (1991) and subsequent expansion set (1993)===
In the November 1991 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 175), Allen Varney gave an ebullient review, saying, &quot;This brilliantly interactive and spectacularly fun 1977 design is my very favorite game, bar none.&quot; Varney questioned the high price of the Mayfair Games re-issue, but concluded, &quot;You definitely will get $35 of fun out of this box. I’ve played the original &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; game (from the late Eon Products) over a hundred times; every game was wildly different.&quot;

Varney again gave a very positive review of the Mayfair edition in the December 1993 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 200), but questioned some of the new rules in Mayfair&#x27;s expansion set, saying the set &quot;offers many terrific powers (and some terribly unbalanced ones) plus new cards and forgettable rules additions like Lucre and Moons.&quot;

In 1992, a new edition of &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1991 and placed 6th in the Deutscher Spiele Preis.

===Retrospective===
&quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Bruno Faidutti commented, &quot;The box for Eon&#x27;s first edition of &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; proclaimed &#x27;the science-fiction game for everyone.&#x27; And, indeed, long before today&#x27;s collectible card games, live-action roleplaying games, and massively multi-player online RPGs, &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; was the game for everyone.&quot; Quintin Smith, in a 2014 review from &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, complimented the variety of aliens, theme, entertainment value, the negotiation mechanism, and uniqueness.

== Influence ==
&quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; was one of the first commercial board games with a simple set of core rules and a specific set of modifications to those rules for each player. The game has been described as one of the innovative games from the 1970s that influenced the development of modern board games. Future Pastimes employed this technique in some of their other designs, notably the &quot;Dune&quot; board game. Steve Jackson was influenced by &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; when he designed &quot;Illuminati&quot; in 1982 (each player has a special power as well as a special victory condition). This design element has become more widespread in boardgames since then; it is especially applicable to games where the players represent individual characters in a role-playing game-like situation (for example, &quot;Talisman&quot; and &quot;Arkham Horror&quot;, both originally published in the 1980s).

The possibility of an organic and completely different experience every time one plays was one of the influences in the design of the card game &quot;&quot;. &quot;Magic&quot; designer Richard Garfield has often cited &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; as being influential in the design of &quot;Magic, the Gathering&quot;, going so far as to say, &quot;[&quot;Magic&quot;&#x27;s] most influential ancestor is a game for which I have no end of respect: &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot;.&quot;

<text>A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure substantially different from the ambient pressure.

Construction methods and materials may be chosen to suit the pressure application, and will depend on the size of the vessel, the contents, working pressure, mass constraints, and the number of items required.

Pressure vessels can be dangerous, and fatal accidents have occurred in the history of their development and operation. Consequently, pressure vessel design, manufacture, and operation are regulated by engineering authorities backed by legislation. For these reasons, the definition of a pressure vessel varies from country to country.

The design involves parameters such as maximum safe operating pressure and temperature, safety factor, corrosion allowance and minimum design temperature (for brittle fracture). Construction is tested using nondestructive testing, such as ultrasonic testing, radiography, and pressure tests. Hydrostatic pressure tests usually use water, but pneumatic tests use air or another gas. Hydrostatic testing is preferred, because it is a safer method, as much less energy is released if a fracture occurs during the test (water does not greatly increase its volume when rapid depressurisation occurs, unlike gases, which expand explosively). Mass or batch production products will often have a representative sample tested to destruction in controlled conditions for quality assurance. Pressure relief devices may be fitted if the overall safety of the system is sufficiently enhanced.

In most countries, vessels over a certain size and pressure must be built to a formal code. In the United States that code is the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). In Europe the code is the Pressure Equipment Directive. These vessels also require an authorised inspector to sign off on every new vessel constructed and each vessel has a nameplate with pertinent information about the vessel, such as maximum allowable working pressure, maximum temperature, minimum design metal temperature, what company manufactured it, the date, its registration number (through the National Board), and American Society of Mechanical Engineers&#x27;s official stamp for pressure vessels (U-stamp). The nameplate makes the vessel traceable and officially an ASME Code vessel.

A special application is pressure vessels for human occupancy, for which more stringent safety rules apply.

==Definition and scope==

The ASME definition of a pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure substantially different from the ambient pressure.

The Australian and New Zealand standard &quot;AS/NZS 1200:2000 Pressure equipment&quot; defines a pressure vessel as a vessel subject to internal or external pressure, including connected components and accessories up to the connection to external piping.

This article may include information on pressure vessels in the broad sense, and is not restricted to any single definition.

===Components===
A pressure vessel comprises a shell, and usually one or more other components needed to pressurise, retain the pressure, depressurise, and provide access for maintenance and inspection. There may be other components and equipment provided to facilitate the intended use, and some of these may be considered parts of the pressure vessel, such as shell penetrations and their closures, and viewports and airlocks on a pressure vessel for human occupancy, as they affect the integrity and strength of the shell, are also part of the structure retaining the pressure. Pressure gauges and safety devices like pressure relief valves may also be deemed part of the pressure vessel. There may also be structural components permanently attached to the vessel for lifting, moving, or mounting it, like a foot ring, skids, handles, lugs, or mounting brackets.

==Uses==
Pressure vessels are used in a variety of applications in both industry and the private sector. They appear in these sectors as industrial compressed air receivers, boilers and domestic hot water storage tanks. Other examples of pressure vessels are diving cylinders, recompression chambers, distillation towers, pressure reactors, autoclaves, and many other vessels in mining operations, oil refineries and petrochemical plants, nuclear reactor vessels, submarine and space ship habitats, atmospheric diving suits, pneumatic reservoirs, hydraulic reservoirs under pressure, rail vehicle air brake reservoirs, road vehicle air brake reservoirs, and storage vessels for high pressure permanent gases and liquified gases such as ammonia, chlorine, and LPG (propane, butane).

A pressure vessel may also support structural loads. The passenger cabin of an airliner&#x27;s outer skin carries both the structural and maneuvering loads of the aircraft, and the cabin pressurization loads. The pressure hull of a submarine also carries the hull structural and maneuvering loads.

==Design==

=== Working pressure ===
The working pressure, i.e. the pressure difference between the interior of the pressure vessel and the surroundings is the primary characteristic considered for design and construction. The concepts of high pressure and low pressure are somewhat flexible, and may be defined differently depending on context. There is also the matter of whether the internal pressure is greater or less than the external pressure, and its magnitude relative to normal atmospheric pressure. A vessel with internal pressure lower than atmospheric may also be called a hypobaric vessel or a vacuum vessel. A pressure vessel with high internal pressure can easily be made to be structurally stable, and will usually fail in tension, but failure due to excessive external pressure is usually by buckling instability and collapse.

===Shape===
Pressure vessels can theoretically be almost any shape, but shapes made of sections of spheres, cylinders, ellipsoids of revolution, and cones with circular sections are usually employed, though some other surfaces of revolution are also inherently stable. A common design is a cylinder with end caps called heads. Head shapes are frequently either hemispherical or dished (torispherical). More complicated shapes have historically been much harder to analyze for safe operation and are usually far more difficult to construct.

Theoretically, a spherical pressure vessel has approximately twice the strength of a cylindrical pressure vessel with the same wall thickness, and is the ideal shape to hold internal pressure. However, a spherical shape is difficult to manufacture, and therefore more expensive, so most pressure vessels are cylindrical with 2:1 semi-elliptical heads or end caps on each end. Smaller pressure vessels are assembled from a pipe and two covers. For cylindrical vessels with a diameter up to 600 mm (NPS of 24 in), it is possible to use seamless pipe for the shell, thus avoiding many inspection and testing issues, mainly the nondestructive examination of radiography for the long seam if required. A disadvantage of these vessels is that greater diameters are more expensive, so that for example the most economic shape of a , pressure vessel might be a diameter of and a length of including the 2:1 semi-elliptical domed end caps.

===Scaling===
No matter what shape it takes, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel scales with the pressure and volume it contains and is inversely proportional to the strength to weight ratio of the construction material (minimum mass decreases as strength increases).

====Scaling of stress in walls of vessel====

Pressure vessels are held together against the gas pressure due to tensile forces within the walls of the container. The normal (tensile) stress in the walls of the container is proportional to the pressure and radius of the vessel and inversely proportional to the thickness of the walls. Therefore, pressure vessels are designed to have a thickness proportional to the radius of tank and the pressure of the tank and inversely proportional to the maximum allowed normal stress of the particular material used in the walls of the container.

Because (for a given pressure) the thickness of the walls scales with the radius of the tank, the mass of a tank (which scales as the length times radius times thickness of the wall for a cylindrical tank) scales with the volume of the gas held (which scales as length times radius squared). The exact formula varies with the tank shape but depends on the density, ρ, and maximum allowable stress σ of the material in addition to the pressure P and volume V of the vessel. (See below for the exact equations for the stress in the walls.)

====Spherical vessel====
For a sphere, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel is

:formula_1,

where:
* formula_2 is mass, (kg)
* formula_3 is the pressure difference from ambient (the gauge pressure), (Pa)
* formula_4 is volume,
* formula_5 is the density of the pressure vessel material, (kg/m3)
* formula_6 is the maximum working stress that material can tolerate. (Pa)

Other shapes besides a sphere have constants larger than 3/2 (infinite cylinders take 2), although some tanks, such as non-spherical wound composite tanks can approach this.

====Cylindrical vessel with hemispherical ends====
This is sometimes called a &quot;bullet&quot; for its shape, although in geometric terms it is a capsule.

For a cylinder with hemispherical ends,
:formula_7,
where
*R is the Radius (m)
*W is the middle cylinder width only, and the overall width is W + 2R (m)

====Cylindrical vessel with semi-elliptical ends====
In a vessel with an aspect ratio of middle cylinder width to radius of 2:1,
:formula_8.

====Gas storage capacity====
In looking at the first equation, the factor PV, in SI units, is in units of (pressurization) energy. For a stored gas, PV is proportional to the mass of gas at a given temperature, thus
:formula_9. (see gas law)

The other factors are constant for a given vessel shape and material. So we can see that there is no theoretical &quot;efficiency of scale&quot;, in terms of the ratio of pressure vessel mass to pressurization energy, or of pressure vessel mass to stored gas mass. For storing gases, &quot;tankage efficiency&quot; is independent of pressure, at least for the same temperature.

So, for example, a typical design for a minimum mass tank to hold helium (as a pressurant gas) on a rocket would use a spherical chamber for a minimum shape constant, carbon fiber for best possible formula_10, and very cold helium for best possible formula_11.

===Stress in thin-walled pressure vessels===
Stress in a thin-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a sphere is
:formula_12,
where formula_13 is hoop stress, or stress in the circumferential direction, formula_14 is stress in the longitudinal direction, &quot;p&quot; is internal gauge pressure, &quot;r&quot; is the inner radius of the sphere, and &quot;t&quot; is thickness of the sphere wall. A vessel can be considered &quot;thin-walled&quot; if the diameter is at least 10 times (sometimes cited as 20 times) greater than the wall thickness.
Stress in a thin-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a cylinder is
:formula_15,
:formula_16,

where:
* formula_13 is hoop stress, or stress in the circumferential direction
* formula_14 is stress in the longitudinal direction
* &quot;p&quot; is internal gauge pressure
* &quot;r&quot; is the inner radius of the cylinder
* &quot;t&quot; is thickness of the cylinder wall.

Almost all pressure vessel design standards contain variations of these two formulas with additional empirical terms to account for variation of stresses across thickness, quality control of welds and in-service corrosion allowances.
All formulae mentioned above assume uniform distribution of membrane stresses across thickness of shell but in reality, that is not the case. Deeper analysis is given by Lamé&#x27;s theorem, which gives the distribution of stress in the walls of a thick-walled cylinder of a homogeneous and isotropic material. The formulae of pressure vessel design standards are extension of Lamé&#x27;s theorem by putting some limit on ratio of inner radius and thickness.

For example, the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) (UG-27) formulas are:
Spherical shells: Thickness has to be less than 0.356 times inner radius
:formula_19

Cylindrical shells: Thickness has to be less than 0.5 times inner radius
:formula_20
:formula_21

where &quot;E&quot; is the joint efficiency, and all others variables as stated above.

The factor of safety is often included in these formulas as well, in the case of the ASME BPVC this term is included in the material stress value when solving for pressure or thickness.

===Shell penetrations===
Also sometimes called hull penetrations, depending on context, shell penetrations are intentional breaks in the structural integrity of the shell, and are usually significant local stress-raisers, so they must be accounted for in the design so they do not become failure points. It is usually necessary to reinforce the shell in the immediate vicinity of such penetrations. Shell penetrations are necessary to provide a variety of functions, including passage of the contents from the outside to the inside and back out, and in special applications for transmission of electricity, light, and other services through the shell. The simplest case is gas cylinders, which need only a neck penetration threaded to fit a valve, while a submarine or spacecraft may have a large number of penetrations for a large number of functions.

==== Penetration thread ====

The screw thread used for high pressure vessel shell penetrations is subject to high loads and must not leak.
High pressure cylinders are produced with conical (tapered) threads and parallel threads. Two sizes of tapered threads have dominated the full metal cylinders in industrial use from in volume.

For smaller fittings, taper thread standard 17E is used, with a 12% taper right hand thread, standard Whitworth 55° form with a pitch of 14 threads per inch (5.5 threads per cm) and pitch diameter at the top thread of the cylinder of . These connections are sealed using thread tape and torqued to between on steel cylinders, and between on aluminium cylinders.

For larger fittings, taper thread standard 25E is used. To screw in the valve, a higher torque of typically about is necessary, Until around 1950, hemp was used as a sealant. Later, a thin sheet of lead pressed to a hat form which closely fitted the external threads, with a hole on top was used. The fitter would squeeze the soft lead shim to conform better with the grooves and ridges of the fitting before screwing it into the hole. The lead would deform to form a thin layer between the internal and external thread, and thereby fill the gaps to create the seal. Since 2005, PTFE-tape has been used to avoid using lead.

A tapered thread provides simple assembly, but requires high torque for connecting and leads to high radial forces in the vessel neck, and has a limited number of times it can be used before it is excessively deformed. This could be extended a bit by always returning the same fitting to the same hole, and avoiding over-tightening.

All cylinders built for working pressure, all diving cylinders, and all composite cylinders use parallel threads. 

Parallel threads for cylinder necks and similar penetrations of pressure vessels are made to several standards:
* M25x2 ISO parallel thread, which is sealed by an O-ring and torqued to on steel, and on aluminium cylinders;
* M18x1.5 parallel thread, which is sealed by an O-ring, and torqued to on steel cylinders, and on aluminium cylinders;
* 3/4&quot;x14 BSP parallel thread, which has a 55° Whitworth thread form, a pitch diameter of and a pitch of 14 threads per inch (1.814 mm);
* 3/4&quot;x14 NGS (NPSM) parallel thread, sealed by an O-ring, torqued to on aluminium cylinders, which has a 60° thread form, a pitch diameter of , and a pitch of 14 threads per inch (5.5 threads per cm);
* 3/4&quot;x16 UNF, sealed by an O-ring, torqued to on aluminium cylinders.
*7/8&quot;x14 UNF, sealed by an O-ring.
The 3/4&quot;NGS and 3/4&quot;BSP are very similar, having the same pitch and a pitch diameter that only differs by about , but they are not compatible, as the thread forms are different.

All parallel thread valves are sealed using an elastomer O-ring at top of the neck thread which seals in a chamfer or step in the cylinder neck and against the flange of the valve.

==== Pressure vessel closures ====
Pressure vessel closures are pressure retaining structures designed to provide quick access to pipelines, pressure vessels, pig traps, filters and filtration systems. Typically pressure vessel closures allow access by maintenance personnel.

A commonly used maintenance access hole shape is elliptical, which allows the closure to be passed through the opening, and rotated into the working position, and is held in place by a bar on the outside, secured by a central bolt. The internal pressure prevents it from being inadvertently opened under load.

Placing the closure on the high pressure side of the opening uses the pressure difference to lock the closure when at service pressure. Where this is impracticable a safety interlock may be mandated.

An airlock is a room or compartment which permits passage between environments of differing atmospheric pressure or composition, while minimizing the changing of pressure or composition between the differing environments. It consists of a chamber with two airtight doors or hatches arranged in series, which are not opened simultaneously. Airlocks can be small or large enough for one or more people to pass through, which may take the form of an antechamber.

An airlock may also be used underwater to allow passage between the air environment in a pressure vessel, such as a submarine or diving bell, and the water environment outside. In such cases the airlock can contain air or water. This is called a floodable airlock or underwater airlock, and is used to prevent water from entering a submersible vessel or underwater habitat. A similar arrangement is used on spacecraft to facilitate extravehicular activity.

===Construction materials===
Many pressure vessels are made of steel. To manufacture a cylindrical or spherical pressure vessel, rolled and possibly forged parts would have to be welded together. Some mechanical properties of steel, achieved by rolling or forging, could be adversely affected by welding, unless special precautions are taken. In addition to adequate mechanical strength, current standards dictate the use of steel with a high impact resistance, especially for vessels used in low temperatures. In applications where carbon steel would suffer corrosion, special corrosion resistant material should also be used.

Some pressure vessels are made of composite materials, such as filament wound composite using carbon fibre held in place with a polymer. Due to the very high tensile strength of carbon fibre these vessels can be very light, but are much more difficult to manufacture. The composite material may be wound around a metal liner, forming a composite overwrapped pressure vessel.

Other very common materials include polymers such as PET in carbonated beverage containers and copper in plumbing.

Pressure vessels may be lined with various metals, ceramics, or polymers to prevent leaking and protect the structure of the vessel from the contained medium. This liner may also carry a significant portion of the pressure load.

Pressure Vessels may also be constructed from concrete (PCV) or other materials which are weak in tension. Cabling, wrapped around the vessel or within the wall or the vessel itself, provides the necessary tension to resist the internal pressure. A &quot;leakproof steel thin membrane&quot; lines the internal wall of the vessel. Such vessels can be assembled from modular pieces and so have &quot;no inherent size limitations&quot;. There is also a high order of redundancy thanks to the large number of individual cables resisting the internal pressure.

The very small vessels used to make liquid butane fueled cigarette lighters are subjected to about 2 bar pressure, depending on ambient temperature. These vessels are often oval (1 x 2 cm ... 1.3 x 2.5 cm) in cross section but sometimes circular. The oval versions generally include one or two internal tension struts which appear to be baffles but which also provide additional cylinder strength.

==Manufacturing processes==

===Riveted===
The standard method of construction for boilers, compressed air receivers and other pressure vessels of iron or steel before gas and electrical welding of reliable quality became widespread was riveted sheets which had been rolled and forged into shape, then riveted together, often using butt straps along the joints, and caulked along the riveted seams by deforming the edges of the overlap with a blunt chisel to create a continuous line of high contact pressure along the joint. Hot riveting caused the rivets to contract on cooling, forming a tighter joint.
===Welded===

Large and low pressure vessels are commonly manufactured from formed plates welded together. Weld quality is critical to safety in pressure vessels for human occupancy.
===Seamless===
The typical circular-cylindrical high pressure gas cylinders for permanent gases (that do not liquify at storing pressure, like air, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, helium) have been manufactured by hot forging by pressing and rolling to get a seamless vessel of consistent material characteristics and minimised stress concentrations.

Working pressure of cylinders for use in industry, skilled craft, diving and medicine had a standardized working pressure (WP) of about in Europe until about 1950. From about 1975, the standard pressure rose to about . Firemen need slim, lightweight cylinders to move in confined spaces; since about 1995 cylinders for WP were used (first in pure steel).

A demand for reduced weight led to different generations of composite (fiber and matrix, over a liner) cylinders that are more vulnerable to impact damage. Composite cylinders for breathing gas are usually built for working pressure of .

Manufacturing methods for seamless metal pressure vessels are commonly used for relatively small diameter cylinders where large numbers will be produced, as the machinery and tooling require large capital outlay. The methods are well suited to high pressure gas transport and storage applications, and provide consistently high quality products.

====Backward extrusion====
Backward extrusion is a process by which the material is forced to flow back along the mandrel between the mandrel and die.
Cold extrusion (aluminium):

Seamless aluminium cylinders may be manufactured by cold backward extrusion of aluminium billets in a process which first presses the walls and base, then trims the top edge of the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck.

Hot extrusion (steel):

In the hot extrusion process a billet of steel is cut to size, induction heated to the correct temperature for the alloy, descaled and placed in the die. The metal is backward extruded by forcing the mandrel into it, causing it to flow through the annular gap until a deep cup is formed. This cup is further drawn to diameter and wall thickness reduced and the bottom formed. After inspection and trimming of the open end, the cylinder is hot spun to close the end and form the neck.

====Drawn====

Seamless cylinders may also be cold drawn from steel plate discs to a cylindrical cup form, in two to four stages, depending on the final ratio of diameter to cylinder length. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. The spinning process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness.

====Spun from seamless tube====
A seamless steel cylinder can also be formed by hot spinning a closure at both ends. The base is first closed completely, and trimmed to form a smooth internal surface before the shoulder and neck are formed.
Regardless of the method used to form the cylinder, it will be machined to finish the neck and cut the neck threads, heat treated, cleaned, and surface finished, stamp marked, tested, and inspected for quality assurance.
===Composite===
Composite pressure vessels are generally laid up from filament wound rovings in a thermosetting polymer matrix. The mandrel may be removable after cure, or may remain a part of the finished product, often providing a more reliable gas or liquid-tight liner, or better chemical resistance to the intended contents than the resin matrix. Metallic inserts may be provided for attaching threaded accessories, such as valves and pipes.

==== Development of composite vessels ====

To classify the different structural principles of gas storage cylinders, 4 types are defined.

* Type 1 – Full metal: Cylinder is made entirely from metal.
* Type 2 – Hoop wrap: Metal cylinder, reinforced by a belt-like hoop wrap with fibre-reinforced resin. 
* Type 3 – Fully wrapped, over metal liner: Diagonally wrapped fibres form the load bearing shell on the cylindrical section and at the bottom and shoulder around the metal neck. The metal liner is thin and provides the gas tight barrier.
* Type 4 – Fully wrapped, over non-metal liner: A lightweight thermoplastic liner provides the gas tight barrier, and the mandrel to wrap fibres and resin matrix around. Only the neck which carries the neck thread and its anchor to the liner is made of metal.

Type 2 and 3 cylinders have been in production since around 1995. Type 4 cylinders are commercially available at least since 2016.

====Winding angle of composite vessels====
Wound infinite cylindrical shapes optimally take a winding angle of 54.7 degrees to the cylindrical axis, as this gives the necessary twice the strength in the circumferential direction to the longitudinal.

Hoop wound fibre reinforcement is wound at an angle of nearly 90° to the cylinder axis.

==Safety==
===Oveerpressure relief===
As the pressure vessel is designed to a pressure, there is typically a safety valve or relief valve to ensure that this pressure is not exceeded in operation.

There may be a rupture disc fitted to the vessel or the cylinder valve or a fusible plug to protect in case of overheating.

====Leak before burst====
Leak before burst describes a pressure vessel designed such that a crack in the vessel will grow through the wall, allowing the contained fluid to escape and reducing the pressure, prior to growing so large as to cause catastrophic fracture at the operating pressure.

Many pressure vessel standards, including the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and the AIAA metallic pressure vessel standard, either require pressure vessel designs to be leak before burst, or require pressure vessels to meet more stringent requirements for fatigue and fracture if they are not shown to be leak before burst.

=== Testing and inspection===

Hydrostatic test (filled with water) pressure is usually 1.5 times working pressure, but DOT test pressure for scuba cylinders is 5/3 (1.66) times working pressure.

=== Operation standards ===

Pressure vessels are designed to operate safely at a specific pressure and temperature, technically referred to as the &quot;Design Pressure&quot; and &quot;Design Temperature&quot;. A vessel that is inadequately designed to handle a high pressure constitutes a very significant safety hazard. Because of that, the design and certification of pressure vessels is governed by design codes such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code in North America, the Pressure Equipment Directive of the EU (PED), Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS), CSA B51 in Canada, Australian Standards in Australia and other international standards like Lloyd&#x27;s, Germanischer Lloyd, Det Norske Veritas, Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS S.A.), Lloyd&#x27;s Register Energy Nederland (formerly known as Stoomwezen) etc.

Note that where the pressure-volume product is part of a safety standard, any incompressible liquid in the vessel can be excluded as it does not contribute to the potential energy stored in the vessel, so only the volume of the compressible part such as gas is used.

== History ==

The earliest documented design of pressure vessels was described in 1495 in the book by Leonardo da Vinci, the Codex Madrid I, in which containers of pressurized air were theorized to lift heavy weights underwater. However, vessels resembling those used today did not come about until the 1800s, when steam was generated in boilers&#x27; helping to spur the Industrial Revolution. However, with poor material quality and manufacturing techniques along with improper knowledge of design, operation and maintenance there was a large number of damaging and often deadly explosions associated with these boilers and pressure vessels, with a death occurring on a nearly daily basis in the United States. Local provinces and states in the US began enacting rules for constructing these vessels after some particularly devastating vessel failures occurred killing dozens of people at a time, which made it difficult for manufacturers to keep up with the varied rules from one location to another. The first pressure vessel code was developed starting in 1911 and released in 1914, starting the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). 

In an early effort to design a tank capable of withstanding pressures up to , a diameter tank was developed in 1919 that was spirally-wound with two layers of high tensile strength steel wire to prevent sidewall rupture, and the end caps longitudinally reinforced with lengthwise high-tensile rods. The need for high pressure and temperature vessels for petroleum refineries and chemical plants gave rise to vessels joined with welding instead of rivets (which were unsuitable for the pressures and temperatures required) and in the 1920s and 1930s the BPVC included welding as an acceptable means of construction; welding is the main means of joining metal vessels today.

There have been many advancements in the field of pressure vessel engineering such as advanced non-destructive examination, phased array ultrasonic testing and radiography, new material grades with increased corrosion resistance and stronger materials, and new ways to join materials such as explosion welding, friction stir welding, advanced theories and means of more accurately assessing the stresses encountered in vessels such as with the use of Finite Element Analysis, allowing the vessels to be built safer and more efficiently. Pressure vessels in the USA require BPVC stamping, but the BPVC is not just a domestic code, many other countries have adopted the BPVC as their official code. There are, however, other official codes in some countries, such as Japan, Australia, Canada, Britain, and other countries in the European Union. Nearly all recognize the inherent potential hazards of pressure vessels and the need for standards and codes regulating their design and construction.

==Alternatives==
*Natural gas storage
*Gas holder
Depending on the application and local circumstances, alternatives to pressure vessels exist. Examples can be seen in domestic water collection systems, where the following may be used:
*Gravity-controlled systems which typically consist of an unpressurized water tank at an elevation higher than the point of use. Pressure at the point of use is the result of the hydrostatic pressure caused by the elevation difference. Gravity systems produce per foot of water head (elevation difference). A municipal water supply or pumped water is typically around .
*Inline pump controllers or pressure-sensitive pumps.
* In nuclear reactors, pressure vessels are primarily used to keep the coolant (water) liquid at high temperatures to increase Carnot efficiency. Other coolants can be kept at high temperatures with much less pressure, explaining the interest in molten salt reactors, lead cooled fast reactors and gas cooled reactors. However, the benefits of not needing a pressure vessel or one of less pressure are in part compensated by drawbacks unique to each alternative approach.

<text>Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) is a tactical-level board wargame, originally marketed by Avalon Hill Games, that simulates actions of squad sized units in World War II. It is a detailed game system for two or more players (with solitary play also possible). Components include the ASL Rulebook and various games called modules. ASL modules provide the standard equipment for playing ASL, including geomorphic mapboards and counters. The mapboards are divided into hexagons to regulate fire and movement, and depict generic terrain that can represent different historical locations. The counters are cardboard pieces that depict squads of soldiers, crews, individual leaders, support weapons, heavy weapons, and vehicles.

Combined with the sales of the original &quot;Squad Leader&quot;, &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; sold over 1 million copies by 1997.

==Introduction==

Fifteen core modules provide representations of nearly every troop type, vehicle, and weapon to see combat action from any nationality involved in World War II. Each module comes with 6 to 20 researched scenarios depicting historical battles. These scenarios are printed on card stock with specifications of game length, map board configuration, counters involved, special rules for the conditions of the particular battle such as weather, and victory conditions. In addition to the scenarios published in the modules, there are numerous other sources for scenarios, both official and unofficial. There is also a detailed set of instructions in the ASL Rulebook for Design Your Own (DYO) scenarios based on a point-purchase system.

Additional variations on ASL include Deluxe ASL (DASL), which was a short-lived experiment in fusing miniature wargaming with ASL; Historical ASL (HASL), which used historically accurate maps, usually in a campaign setting where the outcome of one scenario affected the setup of following scenarios; Solitaire ASL (SASL) with many rules changes for fog of war and command to enhance solitaire play; and the ASL Starter Kits (ASLSK), a series of stand-alone introductory kits.

The game was first published by Avalon Hill in 1985 as a successor to the award-winning &quot;Squad Leader&quot; series, on which the game is based and from which the rules and components were directly developed. By the time the fourth and final installment of &quot;Squad Leader&quot; debuted, there were four separate rulebooks in existence with poorly integrated and sometimes contradictory rules. For example, U.S. forces had lower morale and were therefore disadvantaged by the use of morale ratings to determine the ability to push ordnance through snow or mud, even though there is no real reason for morale to affect such an attempt. It was clear that the system had grown in ways never dreamed of in 1977; large amounts of &quot;nutmail&quot; to Avalon Hill convinced the developers of the need to streamline the rules.

==ASL==

Avalon Hill had originally promised a new rulebook streamlining procedures, eliminating redundancies, and possibly revising the &quot;To Hit/To Kill&quot; system used to simulate armor protection and penetration in tank combat. Instead, by the time it debuted, &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; had become a complete replacement of the games of the original SL series. As an example, the original SL has only twelve different tank and assault gun types, and only five different armor ratings, from -2 to +2. By contrast, ASL has separate counters for 56 different types of tanks and assault guns for the Germans alone, with armor values from 0 to 26, based on actual thickness and degree of slope. Beyond Valor includes 99 separate German vehicles simulated in the game, including halftracks, armored cars, anti-aircraft vehicles, and soft skins.

Many fans of the original &quot;Squad Leader&quot; game who had looked forward to improvements to the system with the release of &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; were taken aback by the need to replace the four modules they had bought; only the map boards of the earlier series were compatible with the new game.

The new game requires at least two products, the Advanced Squad Leader Rulebook and an initial module, either Beyond Valor, which contains a brand new counter mix for the German, Russian and Finnish armies, as well as all necessary system counters, or else Paratrooper, which contains a limited counter mix for system markers, US paratrooper units and their German opponents in Normandy. Either initial module also requires ownership of boards from SL in order to play the included scenarios.

The new game does not feature programmed instruction, instead of requiring a thorough reading of at least four chapters of the ASL Rulebook to play a game with ordnance and/or vehicles in it. Even the most basic ASL components were no longer introductory in nature, although Paratrooper masqueraded as such. (This would be redressed in 2004 by the introduction of ASL Starter Kits). Avalon Hill actually suggested that anyone wishing to play ASL also purchase the original &quot;Squad Leader&quot; and gain experience with that system first, and kept the original SL and three gamettes in print. The necessity of owning boards from these modules in order to play printed scenarios in the core modules of ASL may also have been a factor in this decision. So while ASL was intended to replace SL, there was a certain ambiguity for many years about the status of SL&#x27;s replacement; the original game was still necessary as a stepping stone to learning ASL, and a source for needed map boards.

ASL was the first of Avalon Hill&#x27;s &#x27;advanced&#x27; games (the others were Advanced Civilization and Advanced Third Reich).

In 1998 Monarch Avalon, Inc. sold its entire line of games to Hasbro. On January 15, 1999, Multi-Man Publishing, LLC (MMP) announced an exclusive association with Hasbro, Inc. &quot;to develop, produce, and distribute games and other products for Avalon Hill&#x27;s &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; (ASL) game system.&quot; MMP is a gaming company founded in 1994 by Perry Cocke and Brian Youse, and later co-partner Curt Schilling, to preserve ASL and other Avalon Hill games. Multi-Man Publishing made many changes to the new system; a decision not to reprint the earlier &quot;Squad Leader&quot; games resulted in reorganization and 2nd editions of many ASL core modules in order to include boards from the earlier games, necessary for play of the printed scenarios in those core modules.

Playtester Jon Mishcon described the new game rather more succinctly in Volume 21, Number 5 of &quot;The General Magazine&quot;, in relation to &quot;Squad Leader&quot;; he wrote that the game was &quot;Closely akin to SL but NOT the same.&quot; ASL took longer to play, punished use of &quot;cheats&quot; that worked in the old game system (one example was flooding an isolated defending unit by moving multiple units towards him; in ASL, units could fire more than once at moving targets in certain situations, which was impossible in the original SL), and emphasized realism over playability. He clarified that while playability had in many cases increased with the organization of the new rules, there were still many &quot;special&quot; circumstances that called for special rules. The new rules did, however, have a very strong systemic approach whereby, in his words, you could

In that same issue of &quot;The General&quot;, Don Greenwood - developer of ASL and also editor of the magazine - responded to harsh criticism by consumers who felt that the redesign of the system was a cash-grab, or worse, a betrayal.

Despite the price tag and the expensive lists of prerequisites for each new module, the game system caught on and new modules continued to be produced twenty-five years after the original release - joining &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; as one of what were known as &quot;The Big Three&quot; games of the hobbyist game industry. A large and active worldwide hobby community thrives around ASL, including tournaments, community websites, clubs, and fanzines. An active trading and auction community enables participants to buy and sell used ASL modules. ASL can be played over the Internet using a system called Virtual Advanced Squad Leader (VASL), using the &quot;Vassal&quot; game engine designed by Rodney Kinney. This is a Java-based application that allows for real-time input by one or more participants/observers who can manipulate graphical representations of map boards and counters, including random dice rolls, LOS checking, chart consultation and all the necessary administrative tasks to play a full game of ASL.

A number of third-party developers also continue to publish modules and scenarios for ASL.

===ASL rulebook===

The ASL Rulebook was reformatted away from the traditional Avalon Hill format used in their smaller games. The ASL Rulebook was modeled after Amarillo Design Bureau&#x27;s Star Fleet Battles rulebook, a format that better supported the &quot;massive&quot; game that ASL had become. Based on military field manuals, the rule book was contained in a three-ring binder. Each chapter was color-coded along the top of the page, with brightly colored section dividers of heavy cardboard stock reproducing charts and diagrams associated with that chapter. Errata would be provided on a regular basis, and coupons in the back of the rulebook could be exchanged by mail for the initial updates to the rulebook. The errata would come in the form of altered pages, with page numbers annotated with the date of any changes; old pages were simply removed from the binder and discarded and the new page inserted. The two largest updates were the &#x27;87 and &#x27;89 sections that came with many pages. The first edition rules shipped with Chapter A, B, C, D, H, J, and N. Chapter N was a visual inventory of all game pieces included in Beyond Valor and several follow up modules but was not fully supported. While early modules did contain the appropriate Chapter N pages, some modules did not have the pages included immediately (Paratrooper&#x27;s Chapter N pages, for example, were not provided until the release of Yanks). HASL modules did not have associated Chapter N pages, and neither did Doomed Battalions.

The rules themselves were heavily streamlined, as promised, though many more procedures were introduced to the game, increasing complexity and playing time (as well as the likelihood of rules arguments). The modelling of infantry weapons was overhauled to prevent unrealistic tactics, and machineguns and ordnance were given variable rates of fire (in other words, the ability to fire more than once per phase, with a certain unpredictability as to how many times worked in). Squads equipped only with small arms now had many options to reflect weapons types; semi-automatic and automatic weapons could be simulated with rules for Spraying Fire or Assault Fire, for example.

Above all, the use of standardized abbreviations and jargon made the rules very technical in outlook; this language is known as &quot;legalese&quot; and is in contrast to more &quot;conversational&quot; types of rules. The debate of the merits of both approaches went as far back as the original &quot;Squad Leader&quot; rulebook written by John Hill and Don Greenwood. ASL came down firmly on the side of &quot;legalese&quot;, though not coincidentally Don Greenwood was the driving force behind ASL with John Hill having moved on to other projects after the original SL.

A 2nd Edition Rulebook was introduced by Multi-Man Publishing in early 2001, combining all previous errata and including updates to Chapters A, B, C, D, H (German/Russian), and J as well as Chapter E (previously available only with the Yanks module) and Chapter K Days 1-8 (previously available only with the Paratrooper Module (Days 1-6), Pegasus Bridge HASL Module (Day 7) and ASL Journal #2 (Day 8)).

All Historical ASL Module rules associated with Historical Study Modules and the ASL Journal were incorporated into a new Chapter Z.

Chapter N is no longer supported in the 2nd Edition ASL Rulebook, and all Chapter N pages have been deleted from reprinted modules. The new rulebook also includes (minor) material not covered in any previous issue of errata, making ownership of the 2nd Edition essential for compatibility with new products or other players who use the 2nd Edition. The 2nd Edition does reflect most, but not all, previous changes to the rules via an issue of replacement pages. There are also cosmetic differences such as larger typeface and improved layout.

===Unique elements===

Perhaps one of the most unusual elements of the ASL system is the use of dice. While using two dice to obtain a bell curve result between 2 and 12 (36 possible outcomes) is not unique to ASL, there are many other ways in which the dice are used. One die is a &quot;colored&quot; die, so that when two dice are rolled, not only will the sum of both dice be used (for example, an attack by a machinegun on an enemy unit will have the result of two dice cross-referenced on the Infantry Fire Table (IFT)), but other results may also be achieved simultaneously. (To continue the example, if the colored die is equal or less to a printed Rate of Fire (ROF) number given for the machinegun, it may fire again in that phase). Comparing the results of the two dice to each other will also create simultaneous results; so while the sum of the dice will be used on the IFT, two sixes (a natural 12) will result in the machinegun suffering a stoppage. If the roll was for an attack by an infantry squad, identical results on both dice would result in &quot;cowering&quot; and a different column on the IFT would be consulted with the dice roll. Double ones will result in a Critical Hit if rolling for an ordnance weapon &quot;To Hit&quot; an enemy target. As well, ASL gives each side in most scenarios a Sniper Activation Number (SAN) that will activate a random sniper attack whenever one side rolls the other&#x27;s SAN for any purpose during gameplay. The dice thus feature heavily in gameplay providing multiple random events every time they are rolled.

===ASL modules===

The following is a list of Advanced Squad Leader Modules, and the dates of their release. There were complex prerequisites for just about all modules after the release of Beyond Valor and Paratrooper, and 2nd Editions of most of the following have reorganized the map boards and rules chapters released with each. Specifically, a re-release of boards 1 to 4 has been necessary given MMPs decision not to reprint the original Squad Leader game and its three gamettes.
*1—&quot;Beyond Valor&quot; (1985)
*2—&quot;Paratrooper&quot; (1986)
*3—&quot;Yanks&quot; (1987)
*3a-&quot;Yanks&quot; (2016 reprint)
*4—&quot;Partisan!&quot; (1987)
*5—&quot;West of Alamein&quot; (1988)
*5a—&quot;For King and Country&quot; (2004)
*6—&quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; (1988)
*7—&quot;Hollow Legions&quot; (1989)
*8—&quot;Code of Bushido&quot; (1990)
*9—&quot;Gung Ho!&quot; (1991)
*10—&quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; (1992)
*10a—&quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; (2020)
*11—&quot;Doomed Battalions&quot; (1998)
*12—&quot;Armies of Oblivion&quot; (2006)
*13—&quot;Rising Sun&quot; (2013)
*14—&quot;Hakkaa Päälle&quot; (2015)
*15—&quot;Forgotten War&quot; (2017)
The original Avalon Hill West of Alamein module originally contained the entire British/Commonwealth order of battle; reprintings by MMP have reorganized the content, splitting the original WOA content into two modules, a 2nd Edition West of Alamein, and a new For King and Country module.

====ASL module prerequisites====

A tremendous strength in the ASL system is its flexibility. Most tactical situations from Second World War history can be recreated using the components of the game system. However, special rules, maps, or map overlays may be required in order to properly portray these situations. ASL modules usually have dependencies on one or more previous module(s) (in other words, use of the material in one module is dependent on ownership of another). Very few modules can be played in isolation.

This is not a complete list.

As well, the problem of prerequisites extends to the playing of printed scenarios, many of which require components from multiple modules, particularly those scenarios released by third-party publishers. For instance, the Order of Battle (OOB) from a module may be needed to play one module while a single map board from the same module may be required to play a particular scenario. The Hollow Legions (HL) Module was originally intended to add on to West of Alamein (WOA) and as such the OOB from For King and Country will not be enough to play all scenarios in HL as the WOA map boards are required as well. Furthermore, an MMP Action Pack is required for one module, a Historical Study.

Finally, the release of the 2nd Edition rules further complicates the process by making some sections of the 1st Edition obsolete. Full compatibility with 2nd Edition rules is only possible by owning the 2nd Edition. This forces some players to purchase the ASLRB all over again. An area the new rules simplifies is the Chapters included in various Modules. Originally a new module would add a new chapter to the ASLRB to cover the new material. For instance, the release of Yanks included special rules in Chapter E and a chapter detailing the American OOB. Any players wishing to use these rules in a following Module would also have to own Yanks. The 2nd Edition helps to alleviate this problem by supplying more rules in one binder. It still does not supply all rules for all situations. For instance, if you wish to play a scenario using Jungle terrain you will need the Code of Bushido module with its rules section. Also, the OOB of particular nationalities and the map boards from particular Modules may still be required for subsequent Modules.

===ASL Action Packs===
ASL Action Packs (AP) are published by MMP. They include new scenarios and boards. They do not contain new rules or counters, with the exception of AP 2 and AP 4 which have new rule pages inserts.

*&quot;Action Pack 1&quot; (AH, 1997)
*&quot;Action Pack 2&quot; (MMP, 1999)
*&quot;Action Pack 3: Few Returned&quot; (MMP, 2007)

*&quot;Action Pack 11: 29 Let&#x27;s Go!&quot; (MMP, 2015)
*&quot;Action Pack 12: ASLOK XXX&quot; (MMP,2015)

==Deluxe ASL==

Deluxe Advanced Squad Leader (DASL) was a version of the Advanced Squad Leader game introduced in 1985. Intended to be a fusion of 1:285 scale miniatures (so-called &quot;micro-armor&quot;) and Squad Leader, the concept never really took off, at least in the printed form sold by Avalon Hill, and only two modules were released, both in 1985.

The 1st edition ASL Rulebook contained a chapter on painting 1:285 scale miniatures, and the Deluxe Advanced Squad Leader Modules were released soon after Beyond Valor. These map boards were 11&quot; by 26&quot; and had greatly enlarged hex grids, each hex being 2.2&quot; inches across. The maps were designed to be used in conjunction with 1:285 scale miniatures, but could naturally be used with the standard cardboard counters and a very brief rulebook chapter gave some additional special rules for using the cardboard counters in the larger hexes. Only two modules were released; the drawback of the larger scale map boards was that the terrain being simulated had to be fairly close-in, and scenarios based on fighting in these kinds of environments. The two official releases focused on city fighting and the hedgerow country in Normandy.

In 2020, the DASL system was re-released. Included were the original 18 scenarios from the first two releases, as well as a further 20 scenarios, all updated scenarios previously released.

===Streets of Fire===

Streets of Fire was the first Deluxe ASL module to be released; the maps were very similar and depicted city terrain similar to that found on the mapboard 1 from &quot;Squad Leader&quot; or the &quot;city boards&quot; found in Beyond Valor.

===Hedgerow Hell===

Hedgerow Hell was the second Deluxe ASL module to be released. The maps represented typical bocage country, with many hedge depictions and more rural type terrain types.

===Deluxe ASL ===

Deluxe ASL was released in 2020 at Winter Offensive in Bowie, Maryland. Its maps were the tri-fold style, repainted by Charlie Kibler and printed on card stock, the so-called &quot;SK&quot; style boards. Also included were all of the original Deluxe ASL overlays (from the 1995 Annual), also repainted by Charlie, and two sheets of *new* overlays and four additional sheets of wooden and stone rubble Kibler overlays

==Historical ASL==

Several modules known as Historical Advanced Squad Leader modules, or HASL, feature maps based on actual terrain as well as historical &quot;campaigns&quot; (known as Campaign Games (CG)) where interlinked scenarios depict several days of fighting over historical objectives. MMP took over production of HASL with A Bridge Too Far, and also released &quot;Historical Studies&quot;, or modules in which the geomorphic mapboards were sometimes substituted for actual terrain maps.

===HASL modules===
*1989: &quot;Red Barricades&quot;
*1993: &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper I&quot;
*1995: &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper II&quot;
*1996: &quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;
*1999: &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;
*1999: &quot;Blood Reef: Tarawa&quot;
*2001: &quot;Operation Watchtower&quot; (historical study)
*2002: &quot;Operation Veritable&quot; (historical study)
*2008: &quot;Valor of the Guards&quot;
*2012: &quot;Festung Budapest&quot;
*2018: &quot;Hatten in Flames&quot;
* 2019: &quot;Red Factories&quot; (incorporates reissued &quot;Red Barricades&quot;)

==Solitaire ASL==

A module designed for solitaire play was designed by MMP, using dice and charts to generate opposing actions, in a system similar to earlier solitaire games like Ambush! or Tokyo Express. Only one module has been released, and MMP has announced that no reprint will be made. No new boards were released with the module, though Chapter S was included covering the special rules for SASL (a 2nd edition was released with expanded solitaire rules), informational counters, several types of charts, and 14 &quot;Mission Cards&quot;, which were the SASL version of scenarios. Only German, Russian, Partisan and US forces were covered in this game, and the rulebook, Beyond Valor and Yanks were prerequisites.

A 2nd Edition was released expanding the charts to include all nationalities covered by ASL, with the exception of Axis Minors and the Finns. An expanded version of Chapter S was included and 21 Mission cards. Prerequisites for play of SASL depend on the nationalities involved.

==ASL Starter Kits==

In 2004, in recognition that newcomers to the ASL hobby would have a hard time learning 200 pages of rules quickly and happily, the Starter Kits were introduced. Along with the new semi-mounted mapboards replacing the older mounted style, these kits provided newcomers to ASL with everything they needed to get into the game with a minimum of reading. In a form of Programmed Instruction not possible with the ASL Rulebook, each starter kit comes with a small pamphlet outlining only the bare minimum of rules necessary for play of the game. Each kit focuses on a particular aspect of ASL.

*&quot;ASL Starter Kit 1&quot;, German, American and Russian forces, infantry, support weapons
*&quot;ASL Starter Kit 2&quot;, German, Italian, British, Allied Minor, and American forces, ordnance
*&quot;ASL Starter Kit 3&quot;, German, American, British and Russian forces, Tanks, armored cars
*&quot;ASL Starter Kit 4&quot;, Japanese and US Marine Corps units, including vehicles and ordnance.

===ASL Starter Kit #1===
The first Starter Kit includes very basic rules to quickly get players into a simplified version of ASL. Counters are included for German, Russian and American infantry units and is intended as a stand-alone purchase with the expectation that players who enjoy the experience will feel comfortable &quot;graduating&quot; to the full-blown ASL game series. In addition to counters and two geomorphic boards (this release also marked the end of expensively mounted mapboards, introducing a less durable cardboard map style), a small rules booklet, quick reference chart, and two dice are included.

===ASL Starter Kit #2===

The second Starter Kit adds rules for using artillery pieces, anti-tank guns, mortars and shaped-charge weapons (SCW - in ASL specifically referring to infantry carried and shoulder fired weapons like the bazooka, PIAT or Panzerschreck). This game, like the first Starter Kit, is intended as a stand-alone game and includes two infantry-only scenarios. Only what is included is necessary for play of the game, with the expectation that players who enjoy the experience will feel comfortable &quot;graduating&quot; to the full-blown ASL game series. In addition to counters depicting various nationalities and boards, a small 20 page rules booklet, pair of quick reference charts, and two dice are included.

(Scenarios s7 and s8 were sold separately in issues of Operations Magazine and are currently available as free downloads from MMP)

===ASL Starter Kit #3===
ASL Starter Kit #3 adds rules for tanks and other vehicles. It contains a comprehensive starter kit 28-page rule book, and a 12-page Historical Notes (ASL chapter H) reference for the vehicles and ordnance contained. Two dice are included.

(scenarios s17 to s19 and 28-31 are available on MMP&#x27;s website as free downloads)

=== Decision at Elst ===
Decision at Elst is the first Advanced Squad Leader Starter Kit Historical Module and covers the battle at Elst, Holland, in September 1944 between British and German units during Operation MARKET-GARDEN. It contains a 28-page Advanced Squad Leader Starter Kit basic rules book and a 20-page Decision at Elst Campaign Game rules booklet.

===ASL Starter Kit #4===

ASL Starter Kit Module #4 PTO brings ASLSK to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO), and adds the Japanese and the United States Marine Corps to the ASLSK lineup. ASLSK#4 is a self-contained ASL module that gives players the opportunity to start playing &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; almost immediately. Two dice are included.

==The General==

&quot;The General&quot; was an Avalon Hill house organ and as such, regularly promoted ASL by including in-depth articles on gameplay, &quot;series replay&quot; features where games were recorded and printed move for further analysis, and published scenarios. There were three main categories of ASL Scenarios printed in &quot;The General&quot;: conversions from the original &quot;Squad Leader&quot; system, new scenarios, and tournament scenarios.

Squad Leader Conversions were lettered A-W, with the first scenarios appearing in Volume 22, Number 6 and the last in Volume 32 Number 3.

Tournament Scenarios were numbered T1 - T16, and ran between Volume 24, Number 2 and Volume 29, Number 1.

New scenarios included those for ASL (G1 - G46, Volume 23, Number 3 to Volume 32 Number 2) as well as three Deluxe ASL scenarios (DASL A - DASL C), one Historical ASL scenario, and one interesting new scenario using the map board from the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Den&quot; game by Avalon Hill (a game about a battle of the American Civil War). This latter was numbered Scenario 3000. Scenario 2000 had been an SL scenario called Operation Hubertus, a &quot;monster scenario&quot; set in Stalingrad and apparently utilizing the research from the later module &quot;Red Barricades&quot;.

==ASL Annual==

Aside from regular features in The General Magazine, AH also produced a series of magazines focused on ASL but with some original SL content also, beginning in 1989. The ASL Annual was, as the name implies, released once a year, with issues in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, and two issues were published in 1993 (called ASL Annual &#x27;93a and ASL Annual &#x27;93b). No issue was published in 1994, with issues again appearing in 1995, 1996 and 1997. The 1995 issue was named ASL Annual &#x27;95w (Winter) in anticipation of a second issue that year being printed in the summer, but it did not materialize. Scenarios located in the ASL Annual were numbered sequentially with an &quot;A&quot; prefix, either ASL Scenario A1, A2, etc., or SL Scenario A1, A2, etc., Deluxe ASL Scenario A1, A2, etc.

==ASL Journal==

When MMP took over publication of ASL components, they started to produce ASL Journal on a generally annual basis. Format for the magazine remained very similar to the ASL Annual, though no SL-themed content was included. with no outside advertising, and full of articles, variants, and scenarios for all incarnations of SL and ASL. New scenarios of ASL (or DASL) were given &quot;J&quot; numbers, while SASL scenarios were given an &quot;r&quot; prefix (since they utilized the Red Barricades mapsheets).

==Third party products==

A variety of &quot;third party&quot; products have been developed for ASL on an ongoing basis by a variety of publishers, including scenario packs and historical modules (including mapsheets). Two prolific &quot;third party&quot; publishers are Critical Hit and Heat of Battle, who have both produced scenario packs, geomorphic and historical mapsheets, and even new playing pieces. In recent years Le Franc Tireur and Bounding Fire productions have also produced a number of substantial products. Other products include player aids such as cards indicating SAN (Sniper Activation Numbers) and for resolving OBA (Off Board Artillery) battery access. There is also an English online free-to-view fanzine called &quot;View From The Trenches&quot; containing articles, reviews, and occasionally scenarios. Since 1996, Evan Sherry and the Tampa ASL Group have produced Schwerpunkt (published by Sherry Enterprises), an ASL magazine that features scenarios, scenario analyses and articles. To date, the Tampa Group has published over 200 scenarios in the pages of Schwerpunkt and its sister publication, Rally Point.

===Scenario design===
Two (unofficial) books on ASL scenario design have been written by ASL enthusiasts. Scenario Designers Guide was self-published by Mark Pitcavage, and Scenario Designer&#x27;s Handbook was published by Michael A. Dorosh.

==ASL for the computer==

===Early computer programs based on Avalon Hill games===
While a computerized assistant for ASL was released (ASL Gamer&#x27;s Assistance Program, or ASL GAP), no computerized version of the game itself has yet materialized. A similar game called Under Fire was released by Avalon Hill&#x27;s computer division in 1985 but like most Avalon Hill computer games, was behind the industry standards for graphics and gameplay. It was not billed as a computer version of ASL, though it did bear some similarities in that players commanded roughly company sized forces. Only three maps were available for play. The game was released for Apple II, Commodore 64, and DOS systems. The game was unique (and rather unsatisfying to many) in that for each of the nine scenarios, victory was not declared at game&#x27;s end. A results screen would show losses in men and equipment, and list possession of objectives, leaving the determination of &quot;victory&quot; to the player.

Approximations of a computerized version of SL/ASL was the 1981 release of Close Assault, also by Avalon Hill, which included an actual mapboard and counters that the human player used to make his moves. He would then input them into the computer for resolution of sighting and combat. Then the computer would make its move, and print only the results that the human units could see.

Though the counters were larger, they used the factors from &quot;Squad Leader&quot;. The player input the weapons and leaders directly into the game rather than using counters as in the board game.

Like the original &quot;Squad Leader&quot; board game, German, Russian and American nationalities were represented. The computer allowed three scenarios and any combination of two forces, including a hypothetical US vs USSR 1945 scenario.

The game was released for the Apple II, Atari 800, and the TRS-80.

===Computer ASL interpretations===

There have been a number of computer game interpretations of ASL.

Close Combat by Atomic Games was originally devised as a computer game version of ASL. Atomic Games had already developed several games for Avalon Hill, however, with Avalon Hill embroiled in a financial crisis that would ultimately lead to its demise, Atomic Games took what work they had completed, severed ties with the board game franchise and completed the game&#x27;s development for Microsoft. The first three Close Combat games were notable, at the time, for being among the few games published by Microsoft. The final two games in the original series were, however, published by Strategic Simulations, Inc.

In 1998 Big Time Software negotiated with Avalon Hill to do a computerized version of &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot;, but plans fell through. Big Time Software went on to produce Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord, which was a 3D tactical computer game very similar to &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; but with significant differences. While lacking much of the arcane detail of ASL (you could not swim, climb cliffs, or descend onto the battlefield by parachute), it also featured an innovative simultaneous turn-based system, and provided complete orders of battle for German, American, British, Canadian, Free French and Polish forces in Northwest Europe from 6 June 1944 to 8 May 1945.

Close Combat and Combat Mission both inspired later computer games which are beyond the scope of this article, including GI Combat (a 3D version of CC which also inspired Eric Young&#x27;s Squad Assault and CMX2, a second-generation version of the Combat Mission game engine. None of these later offspring of CC or CM were directly related to ASL, and both series took on lives of their own.

WW2T is a 2D computer game for PC, Linux and Mac OSX based on the ASL rule set. The game has been released in 2015 and is currently in Alpha version. It can be played in hotseat mode, against another opponent in a LAN or online via a webservice. The rule set so far covers infantry and ordnance but is permanently extended. It also features a simple map and scenario editor to create your own matches. All ASL rules are fully validated by the game engine so new players without extended knowledge of the game rules should be able to play more rapidly.

===Avalon Hill&#x27;s Squad Leader===

Hasbro eventually permitted the release of a game called &quot;Avalon Hill&#x27;s Squad Leader&quot; The game, released by MicroProse in 2000 (but developed by Random Games), bore no resemblance to either &quot;Squad Leader&quot; or &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot;, was well behind industry standards in terms of graphics and gameplay, had an awkward interface and was on a completely different scale than the actual SL and ASL games.

===Virtual Advanced Squad Leader===

The most successful literal adaptation of ASL to the computer has been Virtual Advanced Squad Leader, designed by Rodney Kinney as described above. VASL still officially requires ownership of the physical components of the games, however, or at least of the printed scenario cards, reference cards, and rulebook. In addition to possession of these physical components, a detailed understanding of the rules must be expected of players, as the computer version does not enforce rules - it merely serves as a means of manipulating 2-dimensional virtual game boards and pieces in an online environment facilitating long distance play, either by email or in real time. The closest the game comes to performing any of the &quot;chores&quot; of playing ASL is by providing random dice roll results for both players and recording moves from hex to hex on the mapboards. Some LOS calculations can also be made by the computer engine.

<doc id="636222" wikidata="Q509244" url="?curid=636222" title="Chyle">
<text>Chyle () is a milky bodily fluid consisting of lymph and emulsified fats, or free fatty acids (FFAs). It is formed in the small intestine during digestion of fatty foods, and taken up by lymph vessels specifically known as lacteals. The lipids in the chyle are colloidally suspended in chylomicrons.

==Clinical significance==
A chyle fistula occurs when defect(s) of lymphatic vessel(s) result in leakage of lymphatic fluid, typically accumulating in the thoracic (pleural) or abdominal (peritoneal) cavities, leading to a chylous pleural effusion (chylothorax) or chylous ascites, respectively.

Diagnosis of a chyle fistula may be accomplished by analysis of pleural/peritoneal fluid. Identifying the source (localizing the lymphatic defect) is often challenging, but may be accomplished with lymphangiography, which is occasionally associated with a serendipitous therapeutic effect (resolution of the leak), thought to be secondary to a sclerosant effect of the lymphangiography contrast.

Due to the extreme friability of the lymphatic vessels, direct repair of defects is impractical. Therefore, treatment of chyle fistulae relies upon either decreased production of lymphatic fluid to allow for healing of lymphatic defect(s) or permanent diversion of lymphatic fluid away from lymphatic defect(s). Decreased production of lymphatic fluid may be accomplished by dietary restriction (or complete replacement of oral intake with total parenteral nutrition), as well as by the medications octreotide (a synthetic analogue of the hormone somatostatin) and orlistat (a lipase inhibitor that decreases absorption of dietary fats). Permanent diversion of lymphatic fluid may be accomplished by thoracic duct embolization (a needle-based procedure to occlude the duct by depositing glue/embolic material into it) or by thoracic duct ligation (an open surgical procedure to occlude the duct by suturing tightly around it).

<doc id="636225" wikidata="Q732673" url="?curid=636225" title="Thrust reversal">
<text>Thrust reversal, also called reverse thrust, is the temporary diversion of an aircraft engine&#x27;s thrust for it to act against the forward travel of the aircraft, providing deceleration. Thrust reverser systems are featured on many jet aircraft to help slow down just after touch-down, reducing wear on the brakes and enabling shorter landing distances. Such devices affect the aircraft significantly and are considered important for safe operations by airlines. There have been accidents involving thrust reversal systems, including fatal ones.

Reverse thrust is also available on many propeller-driven aircraft through reversing the controllable-pitch propellers to a negative angle. The equivalent concept for a ship is called astern propulsion.

==Principle and uses==
A landing roll consists of touchdown, bringing the aircraft to taxi speed, and eventually to a complete stop. However, most commercial jet engines continue to produce thrust in the forward direction, even when idle, acting against the deceleration of the aircraft. The brakes of the landing gear of most modern aircraft are sufficient in normal circumstances to stop the aircraft by themselves, but for safety purposes, and to reduce the stress on the brakes, another deceleration method can be beneficial. In scenarios involving bad weather, where factors like snow or rain on the runway reduce the effectiveness of the brakes, and in emergencies like rejected takeoffs, this need is more pronounced.

A simple and effective method is to reverse the direction of the exhaust stream of the jet engine and use the power of the engine itself to decelerate. Ideally, the reversed exhaust stream would be directed straight forward. However, for aerodynamic reasons, this is not possible, and a 135° angle is taken, resulting in less effectiveness than would otherwise be possible. Thrust reversal can also be used in flight to reduce airspeed, though this is not common with modern aircraft. There are three common types of thrust reversing systems used on jet engines: the target, clam-shell, and cold stream systems. Some propeller-driven aircraft equipped with variable-pitch propellers can reverse thrust by changing the pitch of their propeller blades. Most commercial jetliners have such devices, and it also has applications in military aviation.

==Types of systems==
Small aircraft typically do not have thrust reversal systems, except in specialized applications. On the other hand, large aircraft (those weighing more than 12,500 lb) almost always have the ability to reverse thrust. Reciprocating engine, turboprop and jet aircraft can all be designed to include thrust reversal systems.

===Propeller-driven aircraft===

Propeller-driven aircraft generate reverse thrust by changing the angle of their controllable-pitch propellers so that the propellers direct their thrust forward. This reverse thrust feature became available with the development of controllable-pitch propellers, which change the angle of the propeller blades to make efficient use of engine power over a wide range of conditions. Reverse thrust is created when the propeller pitch angle is reduced from fine to negative. This is called the beta position.

While piston-engine aircraft tend not to have reverse thrust, turboprop aircraft generally do. Examples include the PAC P-750 XSTOL, Cessna 208 Caravan, and Pilatus PC-6 Porter.

One special application of reverse thrust comes in its use on multi-engine seaplanes and flying boats. These aircraft, when landing on water, have no conventional braking method and must rely on slaloming and/or reverse thrust, as well as the drag of the water in order to slow or stop. In addition, reverse thrust is often necessary for maneuvering on the water, where it is used to make tight turns or even propel the aircraft in reverse, maneuvers which may prove necessary for leaving a dock or beach.

===Jet aircraft===

On aircraft using jet engines, thrust reversal is accomplished by causing the jet blast to flow forward. The engine does not run or rotate in reverse; instead, thrust reversing devices are used to block the blast and redirect it forward. High bypass ratio engines usually reverse thrust by changing the direction of only the fan airflow, since the majority of thrust is generated by this section, as opposed to the core. There are three jet engine thrust reversal systems in common use:

====External types====

The target thrust reverser uses a pair of hydraulically operated &quot;bucket&quot; or &quot;clamshell&quot; type doors to reverse the hot gas stream. For forward thrust, these doors form the propelling nozzle of the engine. In the original implementation of this system on the Boeing 707, and still common today, two reverser buckets were hinged so when deployed they block the rearward flow of the exhaust and redirect it with a forward component. This type of reverser is visible at the rear of the engine during deployment.

====Internal types====
Internal thrust reversers use deflector doors inside the engine shroud to redirect airflow through openings in the side of the nacelle. In turbojet and mixed-flow bypass turbofan engines, one type uses pneumatically operated &quot;clamshell&quot; deflectors to redirect engine exhaust. The reverser ducts may be fitted with cascade vanes to further redirect the airflow forward.
In contrast to the two types used on turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines, many high-bypass turbofan engines use a &quot;cold-stream&quot; reverser. This design places the deflector doors in the bypass duct to redirect only the portion of the airflow from the engine&#x27;s fan section that bypasses the combustion chamber. Engines such as the A320 and A340 versions of the CFM56 direct the airflow forward with a &quot;pivoting-door&quot; reverser similar to the internal clamshell used in some turbojets. &quot;Cascade&quot; reversers use a vane cascade that is uncovered by a sleeve around the perimeter of the engine nacelle that slides aft by means of an air motor. During normal operation, the reverse thrust vanes are blocked. On selection, the system folds the doors to block off the cold stream final nozzle and redirect this airflow to the cascade vanes. 

In cold-stream reversers, the exhaust from the combustion chamber continues to generate forward thrust, making this design less effective. It can also redirect core exhaust flow if equipped with a hot stream spoiler. The cold stream cascade system is known for structural integrity, reliability and versatility, but can be heavy and difficult to integrate into nacelles housing large engines.

==Operation==

In most cockpit setups, reverse thrust is set when the thrust levers are on idle by pulling them farther back. Reverse thrust is typically applied immediately after touchdown, often along with spoilers, to improve deceleration early in the landing roll when residual aerodynamic lift and high speed limit the effectiveness of the brakes located on the landing gear. Reverse thrust is always selected manually, either using levers attached to the thrust levers or moving the thrust levers into a reverse thrust &#x27;gate&#x27;.

The early deceleration provided by reverse thrust can reduce landing roll by a quarter or more. Regulations dictate, however, that an aircraft must be able to land on a runway without the use of thrust reversal in order to be certified to land there as part of scheduled airline service.

Once the aircraft&#x27;s speed has slowed, reverse thrust is shut down to prevent the reversed airflow from throwing debris in front of the engine intakes where it can be ingested, causing foreign object damage. If circumstances require it, reverse thrust can be used all the way to a stop, or even to provide thrust to push the aircraft backward, though aircraft tugs or towbars are more commonly used for that purpose. When reverse thrust is used to push an aircraft back from the gate, the maneuver is called a powerback. Some manufacturers warn against the use of this procedure during icy conditions as using reverse thrust on snow- or slush-covered ground can cause slush, water, and runway deicers to become airborne and adhere to wing surfaces.

If the full power of reverse thrust is not desirable, thrust reverse can be operated with the throttle set at less than full power, even down to idle power, which reduces stress and wear on engine components. Reverse thrust is sometimes selected on idling engines to eliminate residual thrust, in particular in icy or slick conditions, or when the engines&#x27; jet blast could cause damage.

===In-flight operation===

Some aircraft, notably some Russian and Soviet aircraft, are able to safely use reverse thrust in flight, though the majority of these are propeller-driven. Many commercial aircraft, however, cannot. In-flight use of reverse thrust has several advantages. It allows for rapid deceleration, enabling quick changes of speed. It also prevents the speed build-up normally associated with steep dives, allowing for rapid loss of altitude, which can be especially useful in hostile environments such as combat zones, and when making steep approaches to land.

The Douglas DC-8 series of airliners has been certified for in-flight reverse thrust since service entry in 1959. Safe and effective for facilitating quick descents at acceptable speeds, it nonetheless produced significant aircraft buffeting, so actual use was less common on passenger flights and more common on cargo and ferry flights, where passenger comfort is not a concern.

The Hawker Siddeley Trident, a 120- to 180-seat airliner, was capable of descending at up to 10,000 ft/min (3,050 m/min) by use of reverse thrust, though this capability was rarely used.

The Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic airliner could use reverse thrust in the air to increase the rate of descent. Only the inboard engines were used, and the engines were placed in reverse idle only in subsonic flight and when the aircraft was below in altitude. This would increase the rate of descent to around .

The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III is one of the few modern aircraft that uses reverse thrust in flight. The Boeing-manufactured aircraft is capable of in-flight deployment of reverse thrust on all four engines to facilitate steep tactical descents up to 15,000 ft/min (4,600 m/min) into combat environments (a descent rate of just over 170 mph, or 274 km/h). The Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, introduced in 1969, also has in-flight reverse capability, although on the inboard engines only.

The Saab 37 Viggen (retired in November 2005) also had the ability to use reverse thrust both before landing, to shorten the needed runway, and taxiing after landing, allowing many Swedish roads to double as wartime runways.

The Shuttle Training Aircraft, a highly modified Grumman Gulfstream II, used reverse thrust in flight to help simulate Space Shuttle aerodynamics so astronauts could practice landings. A similar technique was employed on a modified Tupolev Tu-154 which simulated the Russian Buran space shuttle.

==Effectiveness==

The amount of thrust and power generated are proportional to the speed of the aircraft, making reverse thrust more effective at high speeds. For maximum effectiveness, it should be applied quickly after touchdown. If activated at low speeds, foreign object damage is possible. There is some danger of an aircraft with thrust reversers applied momentarily leaving the ground again due to both the effect of the reverse thrust and the nose-up pitch effect from the spoilers. For aircraft susceptible to such an occurrence, pilots must take care to achieve a firm position on the ground before applying reverse thrust. If applied before the nose-wheel is in contact with the ground, there is a chance of asymmetric deployment causing an uncontrollable yaw towards the side of higher thrust, as steering the aircraft with the nose wheel is the only way to maintain control of the direction of travel in this situation.

Reverse thrust mode is used only for a fraction of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of design, weight, maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in rejected take-offs and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider thrust reverser systems a vital part of reaching a maximum level of aircraft operating safety.

==Related accidents and incidents==
In-flight deployment of reverse thrust has directly contributed to the crashes of several transport-type aircraft:
* On 4 July 1966 an Air New Zealand Douglas DC-8-52 with the registration ZK-NZB crashed on takeoff on a routine training flight from Auckland International Airport due to reverse thrust applied during a simulated failure of the no. 4 engine on takeoff. The crash killed 2 of the 5 crew on board. 
* On 11 February 1978, Pacific Western Airlines Flight 314, a Boeing 737-200, crashed while executing a rejected landing at Cranbrook Airport. The left thrust reverser had not properly stowed; it deployed during the climbout, causing the aircraft to roll to the left and strike the ground. Out of 44 passengers and 5 crew members, only 6 passengers and a flight attendant survived.
*On 9 February 1982, Japan Airlines Flight 350 crashed short of the runway at Tokyo Haneda Airport following the intentional deployment of reverse thrust on two of the Douglas DC-8&#x27;s four engines by the mentally unstable captain, resulting in 24 passenger deaths.
*On 29 August 1990, a United States Air Force Lockheed C-5 Galaxy crashed shortly after take-off from Ramstein Air Base in Germany. As the aircraft started to climb off the runway, one of the thrust reversers suddenly deployed. This resulted in loss of control of the aircraft and the subsequent crash. Of the 17 people on board, 4 survived the crash.
*On 26 May 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, a Boeing 767-300ER, had an uncommanded deployment of the left engine&#x27;s thrust reverser, which caused the airliner to go into a rapid dive and break up in mid-air. All 213 passengers and 10 crew were killed.
*On 31 October 1996, TAM Linhas Aéreas Flight 402, a Fokker 100, crashed shortly after take-off from Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport, São Paulo, Brazil, striking two apartment buildings and several houses. All 90 passengers and 6 crew members as well as 3 people on the ground died in the crash. The crash was attributed to the un-commanded deployment of a faulty thrust reverser on the right engine shortly after take-off.
* On 10 February 2004, Kish Air Flight 7170, a Fokker 50, crashed while on approach to Sharjah International Airport. A total of 43 out of the 46 passengers and crew on board were killed. Investigators determined that the pilots had prematurely set the propellers to reverse thrust mode, causing them to lose control of the aircraft.

<text>Herbert John Pulman (12 December 192325 December 1998) was an English professional snooker player who was the World Snooker Champion from 1957 to 1968. He first won the title at the 1957 Championship and retained it across seven challenges from 1964 to 1968, three of them against Fred Davis and two against Rex Williams. When the tournament reverted to a knockout event in 1969, he lost 18–25 in the first round to the eventual champion John Spencer. After finishing as runner-up to Ray Reardon in 1970, Pulman never again reached the final, although he was a losing semi-finalist in 1977.

He turned professional in 1946, shortly after winning the English Amateur Championship, and achieved three News of the World Snooker Tournament titles, in 1954, 1957 and 1958. An emotional player, he was prone to venting his frustration and missing important shots. He generally played attacking snooker in his early career, but he made more use of tactics in the 1970s.

Pulman became a television commentator towards the end of his playing career and retired from competitive play in 1981 after breaking his leg in a traffic accident. He died in 1998 following a fall down the stairs at his home. He was one of the inaugural inductees to the World Snooker Hall of Fame in 2011, alongside seven other winners of multiple world championships.

== Early life ==
Herbert John Pulman, known as John Pulman, was born on 12 December 1923 in Teignmouth, Devon, England. His father was Ernest Charles Pulman, a master baker and confectioner, and his mother was Ernest&#x27;s wife Gertrude Mary Pulman, née Kent. In 1929, Ernest Pulman sold his bakery and confectionery business, and the family moved to Plymouth, where he bought a billiard hall with two tables. Coached by his father, John Pulman started playing billiards at the age of nine and made his first billiards aged twelve. In his teenage years he also played snooker and participated in local league competitions. He attended Exeter Episcopal School, where he was a swimming champion and represented his county at water polo.

In 1938, Pulman entered the British Boys Billiards Championship but left his cue on the train on his way to the event at Burroughes Hall. He was invited to choose a cue from a selection at the venue, and he used that particular cue for the rest of his career. In his first match at the event, against Barrie Smith (later known professionally as John Barrie), Pulman was 199–196 ahead in a 200-up match when he . Smith then got the he needed to win. The cue that Pulman had chosen included a metal plate with professional Sidney Smith&#x27;s name engraved on it; he later filed Smith&#x27;s name off, as he felt he could not play exhibition matches with a cue bearing another professional&#x27;s name.

During World War II, Pulman was enlisted in the army for three months, making wings for Spitfires, before being discharged on medical grounds; he later told journalist Terry Smith that he had varicose veins.

==Snooker career==
=== Early professional career (1946–1955) ===
In 1946, Pulman won the English Amateur Championship title, with a 5–3 win over Albert Brown in the final. Aged 20, Pulman was the youngest player to win the event since it was established in 1916. Working as an income tax clerk, he took the decision to become a professional player shortly after the championship, having taken advice from Joe Davis, the reigning World Champion. Later that year, he made his first two century breaks, just ten days apart.

At the start of his professional career, Pulman was living at the home of his patron Bill Lampard, who was a baker from Bristol and a member of the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC). Lampard built a billiard room at his house, where Pulman was able to practise. Snooker historian Clive Everton alleges that this arrangement ended after Pulman was discovered in bed with Lampard&#x27;s wife. Pulman practised playing snooker for eight hours a day over several years, in pursuit of a level of consistency that would bring him to the standard of the top professionals. Shortly after turning professional, he had started wearing spectacles for playing snooker, using the same type of swivel-lens glasses that were worn by his fellow professional Fred Davis.

Pulman made his first appearance at the World Snooker Championship in 1947, losing 14–21 to Brown in the first round of qualification. The following season, he won the qualifying section of the 1948 World Championship, progressing through the first two matches and then defeating Willie Leigh 18–17 on the final in the of the last qualifying match. He lost 29–42 to Clark McConachy in the first round of the main draw. Later the same year, he won the qualifying event for the 1948 Sunday Empire News Tournament and, benefitting from a points handicap, finished second in the main event behind Joe Davis. Pulman&#x27;s total prize money was £400 (), made up of £150 for his qualifying win and £250 for his second-place finish overall.

At the 1949 World Championship, Pulman eliminated Brown in his first match but then lost 22–49 to Walter Donaldson in the semi-finals. He lost his opening match in 1950 and withdrew from the following year&#x27;s championship due to influenza when trailing 14–22 against Fred Davis in their semi-final match. He also participated in the annual News of the World Snooker Tournament, which was a round-robin event with points handicaps applied, first staged in 1949/1950. He was runner-up in the 1950/1951 edition and won in 1953/1954. He married Frances Anne Hayes in April 1953.

=== World snooker championship contests (1955–1968) ===
Pulman first reached the final of the World Professional Match-play Championship, which was now effectively the world championship, in 1955. He defeated Rex Williams 22–15 in the quarter-finals and Alec Brown 37–24 in the semi-finals before losing 35–38 to Fred Davis in the final, which was played at Blackpool Tower Circus. Davis was 10–2 ahead at the end of the first day, but Pulman had narrowed the gap, at 15–9, by the end of the second day of play. Davis led 20–16 after day three, 27–21 after day four and 33–27 after day five; he won the match on the sixth day to claim the title. Pulman made three century breaks during the final: 103 on day two, another 103 on day four, and 101 in the last of the . Davis defeated him again in the 1956 final, at 33–37, with the score finishing at 35–38 after dead frames. Pulman won all five of his matches at the 1956/1957 News of the World Snooker Tournament, to take the title for a second time.

Fred Davis was not among the four entrants for the 1957 World Professional Match-play Championship. In the semi-finals, Pulman was level at 12–12 with Williams before winning the match 19–16. In the final, he trailed Jack Rea at 2–4, 5–8 and 8–11 before equalising at 11–11. Rea then opened up another lead to leave Pulman 15–20 behind. Pulman took four successive frames to narrow his deficit to 19–20, going on to take the lead 24–22, and starting the final day 32–27 ahead. He won the title at 37–29, and the score finished at 39–34 after dead frames. The tournament received little media coverage, and the championship was not staged again for another seven years. Public interest in the sport had been declining since 1946 when Joe Davis retired from competing in the world championship. In preference to finding an alternative career, Pulman continued to play exhibition matches, despite the limited income he was able to earn from this.

In 1964, the Conayes Professional Tournament was held at the Rex Williams Snooker Centre in Blackheath, being the first commercially sponsored professional snooker event since 1960. Pulman was one of the four competitors, along with Fred Davis, Rea, and Williams, and won the event. Williams was the driving force behind the revival of the World Snooker Championship in 1964, obtaining sanction for the competition after an approach to the BA&amp;CC chairman Harold Phillips. The championship was reinstated on a challenge basis, with the first match scheduled between Pulman, who had won the most recent championship in 1957, and the challenger Fred Davis. Pulman defeated Davis 19–16 at Burroughes Hall in April 1964 to retain the title that he had claimed seven years earlier. Davis had been leading 15–12 when he failed to audibly nominate a , and the referee called a ; despite both players disagreeing with the referee&#x27;s decision, he refused to change his ruling, and commentators felt that Davis&#x27;s reaction led to a noticeable deterioration in the standard of his play.

Williams challenged Pulman for the title in October 1964. The match was played over 73 frames and took place from 12 to 17 October at Burroughes Hall. Williams led 8–4 at the end of the first day, but Pulman won 11 of the 12 frames on the second day to lead 15–9. He extended his lead to 31–17 after the fourth day of play, winning the match on the fifth day by taking a 37–23 lead. After playing the remaining 13 dead frames on the sixth and final day, Pulman finished 40–33 ahead.

In March 1965, Pulman retained his title in a final-frame decider by defeating his challenger Fred Davis, 37–36, winning the last two frames from 35–36 behind. Williams and Pulman met again in late 1965 in a series of short matches in South Africa, where Pulman won 25 of their 47 matches. At one of the venues, where there were no spectators present, the players reportedly spun a coin to determine the winner, instead of playing the match. In late 1965, Pulman defeated a further challenger, Fred Van Rensburg, 39–12.

Fred Davis challenged Pulman for a third time in 1966, in a series of seven best-of-five-frames matches. Pulman won the series at four matches to Davis&#x27;s two, also taking the seventh match to win 5–2. Pulman won the world title for the eighth time in 1968 by fending off a challenge from Eddie Charlton. After the first 30 frames, Charlton was ahead 16–14; Pulman then took five of the next six frames, three of them on the final black, leaving Charlton 17–19 behind. Pulman eventually reached a winning lead of 37–28 and finished 39–34 ahead after dead frames.

=== Later career and retirement (1968–1998) ===
In 1967, Pulman had spent time touring snooker clubs across the Midlands doing promotional work for the tobacco brand John Player, and in turn the company sponsored his 1968 world title challenge match against Eddie Charlton. The good attendances for the Pulman/Charlton match led to John Player&#x27;s decision to sponsor the 1969 World Snooker Championship as a knockout tournament. The 1969 event, with its updated format, is generally regarded as the start of the modern snooker era. Unable to defend his title, Pulman was eliminated 18–25 by the eventual champion John Spencer in the first round of the competition.

He reached the final of the 1970 World Championship but lost 33–37 to Ray Reardon, having earlier recovered from 14–27 behind to almost draw level at 33–34. The following year, he failed to qualify from the round-robin stages that determined the semi-finalists, and in 1972 he lost 23–31 to the eventual champion Alex Higgins in the quarter-finals. In October 1972, he was rescued, unconscious, from a road traffic collision, but he fully recovered in time to play in the Park Drive 2000 tournament that was held less than two weeks later. That December, he was runner-up to Higgins in the 1972 Ford Series Tournament, an invitational event with four world champions in competition. The following year, he reached the final of the 1973 Norwich Union Open. His opponent, Spencer, took a 5–2 lead before Pulman won five of the next seven frames to level the match at 7–7 and force a deciding frame. Spencer led by 57 points, but Pulman then made a break of 39 before failing to the , allowing Spencer to as far as the and win the match.

Pulman did not progress to the quarter-final stage of the World Championship again until 1977, the first time the event was held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. He reached the semi-finals, with wins over Fred Davis and Graham Miles, before losing 16–18 to Spencer, the eventual champion. After 1977, he was unable to win another World Championship match, although he continued to enter until 1982. He reached the final of the 1977 Pontins Professional event, where he was again defeated by Spencer, 5–7. After the introduction of snooker world rankings in 1976, Pulman achieved his highest position of seventh in the 1977/1978 ranking list.

His book &quot;Tackle Snooker This Way&quot;, which had first been published in 1965, was revised and published as &quot;Tackle Snooker&quot; in 1974. Pulman and his wife Frances divorced around 1978; they had three children. He was declared bankrupt on 7 February 1979 with personal debts of £5,916 (). By this time, he was suffering from severe motivational problems and living in a hotel in Bromley.

He did not play professionally again after his leg was broken in five places when he was hit by a London bus in October 1981. He later admitted that he had already lost his enthusiasm for playing snooker by the time his accident happened. While he was being treated in hospital, he accepted an offer from ITV to work as a snooker commentator, having previously worked in that role for the BBC and for STV. He continued to commentate until his death. Everton, who had taken Pulman to court in a dispute over payment for his contribution to Pulman&#x27;s &quot;Tackle Snooker&quot;, later wrote that Pulman had &quot;the voice, the authority, and of course the knowledge&quot; to be a good commentator.

In 1998, he fell down the stairs at home while his girlfriend was away, broke his hip, and lay on the floor unable to move for almost 24 hours. He was transferred to hospital and died soon afterwards, on 25 December 1998, aged 75.

==Playing style and influence==
Pulman was an emotional player, prone to venting his frustration and missing important shots. For the first part of his career he generally played attacking snooker, but in the 1970s he made more use of tactics. Fred Davis reflected that Pulman&#x27;s impatience and lapses in concentration had probably cost him frames in their world championship finals in the mid-1950s and that, as Pulman became more patient in his play, he became a stronger opponent. At 6feet 2inches (188cm), Pulman was unusually tall among the leading players of the 1940s, and adapted a stance where his legs were relatively close together, meaning that more weight was transferred to his back foot than was typical among professionals. This enabled him to take full advantage of his height and his reach while playing shots.

In their 2005 book &quot;Masters of the Baize&quot;, Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby commented that Pulman &quot;suffered the unenviable fate of being world champion for the 11-year period between 1957 and 1968 in which professional snooker all but died&quot;. Commentator Ted Lowe, who had managed Leicester Square Hall from 1947 to 1955 and was a long-time snooker commentator for BBC Television, considered that Pulman&#x27;s exciting style of play and sense of humour &quot;did a tremendous salvage job for the game when it needed it most&quot;.

Alex Higgins, the world champion in 1972 and 1982 whose popularity helped make snooker a growing sport in the 1970s and 1980s, wrote of Pulman: &quot;If I ever had a hero as a kid, I guess it was John Pulman... [when] I was growing up, Pulman was invincible: a brilliant potter, a tactician, and foxy in the safety department.&quot; Pulman&#x27;s all-round game was also praised by Ray Reardon. John Spencer admired Pulman&#x27;s aptitude when using a . Steve Davis, who met Pulman in a match at the 1977 Pontins Open, observed how Pulman and Reardon both adapted to the poor quality of the snooker tables rather than complaining, and he found this to be a valuable lesson.

Pulman was one of the inaugural inductees to the World Snooker Hall of Fame in 2011, alongside seven other winners of multiple world championships.

<doc id="636229" wikidata="Q1054718" url="?curid=636229" title="Kidney disease">
<text>Kidney disease, or renal disease, technically referred to as nephropathy, is damage to or disease of a kidney. Nephritis is an inflammatory kidney disease and has several types according to the location of the inflammation. Inflammation can be diagnosed by blood tests. Nephrosis is non-inflammatory kidney disease. Nephritis and nephrosis can give rise to nephritic syndrome and nephrotic syndrome respectively. Kidney disease usually causes a loss of kidney function to some degree and can result in kidney failure, the complete loss of kidney function. Kidney failure is known as the end-stage of kidney disease, where dialysis or a kidney transplant is the only treatment option.

Chronic kidney disease is defined as prolonged kidney abnormalities (functional and/or structural in nature) that last for more than three months. Acute kidney disease is now termed acute kidney injury and is marked by the sudden reduction in kidney function over seven days. 

Rates for both chronic kidney disease and mortality have increased, associated with the rising prevalence of diabetes and the ageing global population. The World Health Organization has reported that &quot;kidney diseases have risen from the world’s nineteenth leading cause of death to the ninth, with the number of deaths increasing by 95% between 2000 and 2021.&quot; In the United States, prevalence has risen from about one in eight in 2007, to one in seven in 2021.

==Causes==
Causes of kidney disease include deposition of the Immunoglobulin A antibodies in the glomerulus, administration of analgesics, xanthine oxidase deficiency, toxicity of chemotherapy agents, and a long-term exposure to lead or its salts. Chronic conditions that can produce nephropathy include systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure (hypertension), which lead to diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephropathy, respectively.

===Analgesics===
One cause of nephropathy is the long term usage of pain medications known as analgesics. The pain medicines which can cause kidney problems include aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. This form of nephropathy is &quot;chronic analgesic nephritis&quot;, a chronic inflammatory change characterized by loss and atrophy of tubules and interstitial fibrosis and inflammation (BRS Pathology, 2nd ed.).

Specifically, long-term use of the analgesic phenacetin has been linked to renal papillary necrosis (necrotizing papillitis).

===Diabetes===

Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive kidney disease caused by angiopathy of the capillaries in the glomeruli. It is characterized by nephrotic syndrome and diffuse scarring of the glomeruli. It is particularly associated with poorly managed diabetes mellitus and is a primary reason for dialysis in many developed countries. It is classified as a small blood vessel complication of diabetes.

=== Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ===
Gabow 1990 talks about autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and how this disease is genetic. They go on to say &quot;Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disease, affecting a half million Americans. The clinical phenotype can result from at least two different gene defects. One gene that can cause ADPKD has been located on the short arm of chromosome 16.&quot; The same article also goes on to say that millions of Americans are affected by this disease and it is very common.

=== COVID-19 ===
COVID-19 is associated with kidney disease. In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the prevalence of acute kidney injury is estimated to be 28%, and the prevalence of renal replacement therapy is estimated to be 9%.

===Diet===
Higher dietary intake of animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol may increase risk for microalbuminuria, a sign of kidney function decline, and generally, diets higher in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains but lower in meat and sweets may be protective against kidney function decline. This may be because sources of animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol, and sweets are more acid-producing, while fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are more base-producing.

===IgA nephropathy===

IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis throughout the world Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the IgA antibody in the glomerulus. The classic presentation (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence &quot;synpharyngitic&quot;) as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.

===Iodinated contrast media===

Kidney disease induced by iodinated contrast media (ICM) is called contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) or contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Currently, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. But there is a body of evidence that several factors including apoptosis-induction seem to play a role.

===Lithium===
Lithium, a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorders, can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; its long-term use can lead to nephropathy.

===Lupus===
Despite expensive treatments, lupus nephritis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with relapsing or refractory lupus nephritis.

===Xanthine oxidase deficiency===

Another possible cause of Kidney disease is due to decreased function of xanthine oxidase in the purine degradation pathway. Xanthine oxidase will degrade hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid. Xanthine is not very soluble in water; therefore, an increase in xanthine forms crystals (which can lead to kidney stones) and result in damage to the kidney. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, like allopurinol, can cause nephropathy.

===Polycystic disease of the kidneys===

Additional possible cause of nephropathy is due to the formation of cysts or pockets containing fluid within the kidneys. These cysts become enlarged with the progression of aging causing renal failure. Cysts may also form in other organs including the liver, brain, and ovaries. Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes. This disease affects about half a million people in the US. Polycystic kidneys are susceptible to infections and cancer.

===Toxicity of chemotherapy agents===

Nephropathy can be associated with some therapies used to treat cancer. The most common form of kidney disease in cancer patients is acute kidney injury (AKI) which can usually be due to volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea that occur following chemotherapy or occasionally due to kidney toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents. Kidney failure from break down of cancer cells, usually after chemotherapy, is unique to onconephrology. Several chemotherapeutic agents, for example cisplatin, are associated with acute and chronic kidney injuries. Newer agents such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) are also associated with similar injuries, as well as proteinuria, hypertension, and thrombotic microangiopathy.

==Diagnosis==
The standard diagnostic workup of suspected kidney disease includes a medical history, physical examination, a urine test, and an ultrasound of the kidneys (renal ultrasonography). An ultrasound is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease.

== Treatment ==
Treatment approaches for kidney disease focus on managing the symptoms, controlling the progression, and also treating co-morbidities that a person may have.

=== Dialysis ===
=== Transplantation ===

Millions of people across the world have kidney disease. Of those millions, several thousand will need dialysis or a kidney transplant at its end-stage. In the United States, as of 2008, 16,500 people needed a kidney transplant. Of those, 5,000 died while waiting for a transplant. Currently, there is a shortage of donors, and in 2007 there were only 64,606 kidney transplants in the world. This shortage of donors is causing countries to place monetary value on kidneys. Countries such as Iran and Singapore are eliminating their lists by paying their citizens to donate. Also, the black market accounts for 5–10 percent of transplants that occur worldwide. The act of buying an organ through the black market is illegal in the United States. To be put on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, patients must first be referred by a physician, then they must choose and contact a donor hospital. Once they choose a donor hospital, patients must then receive an evaluation to make sure they are sustainable to receive a transplant. In order to be a match for a kidney transplant, patients must match blood type and human leukocyte antigen factors with their donors. They must also have no reactions to the antibodies from the donor&#x27;s kidneys.

==Prognosis==
Kidney disease can have serious consequences if it cannot be controlled effectively. Generally, the progression of kidney disease is from mild to serious. Some kidney diseases can cause kidney failure.

<text>Denis Rogers (30 September 1917 – 7 December 1987) was a New Zealand doctor and local-body politician.

==Biography==
Rogers was born in Hamilton, New Zealand, and attended Nelson College from 1931 to 1934. He studied medicine at the University of Otago, graduating MB ChB in 1941, and became a general practitioner.

Rogers stood for the Hamilton City Council in 1956. He was the highest polling candidate and became deputy mayor. He was the mayor of Hamilton from 1959 to 1968, elected for three terms. During his mayoralty, he campaigned for the poor and for an international airport to be built in Hamilton.

Rogers was married to Helen Wyn-Hesse and they had three children. He was well known for his like of gardening, and the Rogers Rose Gardens in Hamilton are named after him.

In the 1964 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Rogers was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and in 1985 he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Hamilton. He died of a heart attack in 1987.

Rogers&#x27; brother, Rufus Rogers, was also a well-known political figure in Hamilton. Starting in 1956, a local campaign began to have a university in Hamilton. The barrister and solicitor Douglas Seymour chaired the lobby group for the first five years, to be succeeded by Rufus Rogers. In 1964, their work was done and the University of Waikato was officially opened by the Governor-General, Sir Bernard Fergusson. Denis Rogers was the university&#x27;s first chancellor from 1964 to 1969. His brother Rufus represented the Hamilton East electorate in Parliament from to 1975.

<doc id="636243" wikidata="Q5153310" url="?curid=636243" title="Common Cold Unit">
<text>The Common Cold Unit (CCU) or Common Cold Research Unit (CCRU) was a unit of the British Medical Research Council which undertook laboratory and epidemiological research on the common cold between 1946 and 1989 and produced 1,006 papers. The Common cold Unit studied etiology, epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of common colds. It was set up on the site of the Harvard Hospital, a former military hospital at Harnham Down near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Common colds account for a third of all acute respiratory infections and the economic costs are substantial in terms of sick leave.

Thirty volunteers were required every fortnight during trial periods. The unit advertised in newspapers and magazines for volunteers, who were paid a small amount. A stay at the unit was presented in these advertisements as an unusual holiday opportunity. The volunteers were infected with preparations of cold viruses and typically stayed for ten days. They were housed in small groups of two or three, with each group strictly isolated from the others during the course of the stay. Volunteers were allowed to go out for walks in the countryside south of Salisbury, but residential areas were out of bounds.

Human coronaviruses, which are responsible for about 10% of common colds, were first isolated from volunteers at the unit in 1965. The CCU continually recruited volunteers for research into the common cold until its closure in 1990. The final director was David Tyrrell, whose autobiography describes his work at the CCU from 1957.

The CCU was sometimes confused with the Microbiological Research Establishment at nearby Porton Down, a military unit with which it occasionally collaborated but was not officially connected.

== History ==
Our current understanding of colds began in 1914 when Dr. Kruse showed that nasal secretions from people with colds could be filtrated to make them free from bacteria and that inoculation of those filtrated washes into the nose of recipients caused the same illness. Christopher Andrewes and David Tyrrell refined these experiments at Harvard Hospital in Salisbury, England. Around 1946 this hospital became the Common Cold Unit of the Medical Research Council. The Common Cold Research Unit was set up by the Medical Research Council after Dr. Andrewes promoted the idea of researches on volunteers and persuaded authorities to set up the research station.

== Discoveries ==
The first coronavirus (B814) was found in washes from a boy with typical common cold symptoms in 1960 during the study led by virologist David Tyrrell at the Common Cold Unit. After washes were inoculated to volunteers and tested for known viruses none was found. Publication about first human coronavirus was published in The BMJ in 1965. Later virologist June Almeida imaged virus for the first time and group of eight virologists including June Almeida named it coronavirus in their publication in 1968.

== Results ==
For 43 years of Common Cold Unit existence thousands of volunteers participated in researches being inoculated with common cold viruses or being in control group, but no cure for the common cold has been found. Some compounds were active against rhinovirus &quot;in vitro&quot;, but they didn&#x27;t demonstrate clinical efficiency. Interferons alpha and beta administered intranasally before virus challenge were effective as prophylactic agents, but they were most effective in prophylaxis rather than treatment and had local side effects so they subsequently were not used in the routine practice against common cold viruses. Research made by the Common Cold Unit improved our understanding of respiratory viruses, their lifecycle and possible vaccines.

<text>Sara Joanne Cryzer ( born 13 December 1974), better known as Sara Cox, is an English broadcaster and author. A presenter on BBC Radio 2, she has been hosting the station&#x27;s drivetime show since January 2019. She previously presented BBC Radio 1&#x27;s breakfast show from April 2000 until December 2003. 

Cox has also presented a number of television shows for the BBC including &quot;The Great Pottery Throw Down&quot; (2015–2017), &quot;Too Much TV&quot; (2016) and &quot;Back in Time for...&quot; (2018–2020).

== Early life and career ==
Cox was born Sarah Joanne Cox on 13 December 1974, but later dropped the use of the letter &#x27;h&#x27; from her first name. Her parents lived in the village of Little Lever near Bolton, Greater Manchester, where she grew up on her father&#x27;s farm. She was the youngest of five children. Her parents separated when she was six or seven, after which she moved with her mother and a sister to another house in the same village. Cox attended Smithills High School until the age of 16, and left Canon Slade School after her four A-levels to pursue a career in modelling. 

She appeared in the music video for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;Everyday&quot;, and on a controversial promotional poster for the 1995 video game &quot;Wipeout&quot;.

Cox won her first television show role in 1996, presenting &quot;The Girlie Show&quot; on Channel 4. She later had stints on Channel 5 entertainment show &quot;Exclusive&quot; and Channel 4 music programme &quot;Born Sloppy&quot;. In 1997 Cox presented on the UK feed of MTV, hosting &quot;MTV Hot&quot;, a late-night music show. In 1998 Cox won her first film role in &quot;The Bitterest Pill.&quot;

In September 1998, Cox became a presenter of &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, following in the footsteps of her close friend Zoe Ball. During her time on the programme, she interviewed stars including Robbie Williams, Sting and Leonardo DiCaprio. Cox preferred to do interviews in her father&#x27;s caravan, situated in &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; garden.

== BBC Radio 1 ==

=== 1999–2002 ===
A transfer to radio came on 19 September 1999 when she joined BBC Radio 1. She launched the hugely popular &quot;The Surgery&quot; with Mark Hamilton, where Cox acted as &quot;Nurse Coxy&quot;. She also co-hosted the Saturday lunchtime show with Emma B from 13:00 – 15:00

In December 1999, it was announced that Cox would again step into Zoe Ball&#x27;s shoes as presenter of &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot;. Cox&#x27;s breakfast show stint began on 3 April 2000. Initially, her listening figures were very good, growing from 6.9 million to 7.8 million listeners during her first fifteen months in the job—earning Radio 1 its largest breakfast audience ever—higher than that of her predecessor and ex-BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Evans. By August 2002, however, numbers had dipped back under 7 million.

===2003–2008===
In January 2003, Cox denied rumours that she was preparing to leave the BBC for a rival show and signed a three-year contract with the public service broadcaster, tying her to the breakfast show and with the BBC for two years after that. In August 2003, the BBC again denied rumours, reported in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, that she had been given 10 weeks to increase ratings, or to face replacement. However, just two months later, the BBC announced that Cox, whose listening figures had slipped to 6.6 million, would be replaced by Chris Moyles in January 2004. Cox hosted her final breakfast show on 19 December 2003.

Cox then presented the afternoon &quot;drivetime&quot; slot, effectively swapping shows with Chris Moyles. She hosted the Drivetime show for six months with features such as &quot;For Your Ears Only&quot;, &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;, and &quot;Chap&#x27;s Eye Pub Quiz&quot; (referring to her former sidekick Mark Chapman). In June 2004, Cox began her maternity leave to give birth. Before she returned to Radio 1 in early 2005, Scott Mills, the presenter who took over her slot during her maternity leave, was given the drivetime slot permanently.

From February 2005, Cox took over the afternoon show (13:00 – 16:00) on Saturdays and Sundays.

===2008–2014===
On 17 February 2008, Cox presented her last show for six months before leaving for maternity leave to have her second child. Annie Mac presented the show during her absence until Cox&#x27;s return in September 2008. Cox and Annie Mac both later covered for Jo Whiley who was on maternity leave between 29 September 2008 to 20 February 2009. Following Whiley&#x27;s return, Cox returned to weekends to present a Sunday mid-morning show, broadcasting between 10:00 and 13:00.

In March 2010, Cox went on maternity leave for the third time, leaving her show in the hands of the newest Radio 1 presenter, Matt Edmondson. She returned to the station on 9 August 2010 to cover for Fearne Cotton for three weeks. Cox made a self-confessed unexpected return to the breakfast show on 2 and 3 September 2010, as she sat in for the unwell Chris Moyles.

In August 2012, it was announced that Cox, Gemma Cairney, Huw Stephens, Jameela Jamil, Alice Levine, and Annie Mac would cover Fearne Cotton&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 1 weekdays from 10:00 to 12:45, whilst Cotton was on maternity leave, until Cotton&#x27;s return in September 2013. After Cotton&#x27;s return, Cox did various cover shows; her final show for Radio 1 was on 17 February 2014.

==BBC Radio 2==
In June 2011, Cox began hosting the fourth series of the comedy programme &quot;Hot Gossip&quot; on BBC Radio 2, covering for Claudia Winkleman, who chose not to present the series as she was heavily pregnant at the time. In 2012, Cox covered for Alex Lester, the late Janice Long, Ken Bruce, and Vanessa Feltz, as well as providing cover for &quot;Simon Mayo Drivetime&quot; and &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot;.

Also between 2012 and 2018, she was the stand-in of &quot;The Radio 2 Breakfast Show&quot; covering for Chris Evans.

Cox joined BBC Radio 2 for her first regular show each Saturday night from 22:00 to midnight, presenting a 1980s decade show &quot;Sounds of the 80s&quot; to complement the weekend 1960s and 1970s decade shows. The show began on Saturday 5 October 2013. The show moved to Friday nights from April 2016.

Between 14 May 2018 and 13 December 2018, Cox began a new late-night show on Radio 2; the show ran from Monday to Thursday between 22:00 to midnight. She was replaced as host of &quot;Sounds of the 80s&quot; by Gary Davies; Cox presented her final edition of the show on 11 May 2018.

On 29 October 2018, it was announced that Cox would succeed Simon Mayo as drivetime presenter on 14 January 2019.

On 1 July 2022, it was announced that, in September, Cox would extend her drivetime show by an hour to run from 4–7pm to coincide with Scott Mills joining the station on a permanent basis to present from 2–4pm.

==Television==
In July 2007, Cox presented &quot;London Live&quot; on Channel 4, and appeared as a guest star on the Sky1 show &quot;Angela and Friends&quot; in November 2009 and as guest presenter in January 2010. Also in 2010, she appeared as a team captain on &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; along with Rufus Hound and Joe Swash on the Watch channel.

Cox commentated for the semi-finals of the Eurovision Song Contest on BBC Three with fellow BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills at the 2011 Contest and 2012 Contest, and again in 2021 as a late stand-in for Rylan Clark. Cox was replaced by Ana Matronic starting from the 2013 Contest.

On 21 October 2014, Cox guest presented a Children in Need episode of &quot;The Great British Sewing Bee&quot;.

In April 2015, it was announced that Cox would present &quot;The Great Pottery Throw Down&quot; for BBC Two. The first series began in November 2015 and the second in February 2017.

In 2016 Cox co-presenting &quot;Too Much TV&quot;, a daily magazine show on BBC Two.

In 2017, Cox appeared on &quot;Dara O Briain&#x27;s Go 8 Bit&quot; and was on Steve&#x27;s team in the show. She lost the episode in terms of points. On 4 June 2017, Cox co-presented the &quot;One Love Manchester &quot;benefit concert special and British television special with Ore Oduba.

Since 2018, Cox has co-presented &quot;Back in Time for...&quot;, where a modern-day family enjoy meals that were eaten by families of years gone by. She replaced Giles Coren. From May 2018, Cox presents &quot;Love in the Countryside&quot; for BBC Two.

On 5 March 2019, it was announced that Cox would host a new ITV show, entitled &quot;The Sara Cox Show&quot;, which would feature entertainment, live music and celebrity guests and which would air on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

In October 2020, Cox launched and presented &quot;Between the Covers&quot; on BBC Two, a seven-episode book programme, renewing for five series, as of December 2022.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/m000n7sl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In March 2019 her book &quot;Till the Cows Come Home: A Lancashire Childhood&quot;, a memoir of growing up in 1980s Lancashire, was published by Coronet Books.

Her debut novel &quot;Thrown&quot; was published in May 2022. Her second novel &quot;Way Back&quot; was published in March 2024.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Cox married the DJ Jon Carter in October 2001. Their daughter was born on 13 June 2004. In December 2005, the couple announced their divorce.

On 16 September 2007, Cox announced, on her BBC Radio 1 weekend show, that she was expecting her second child. Cox&#x27;s last weekend show was on Sunday 17 February 2008 before she left for six months&#x27; maternity leave. Her second child, a boy, was born on 10 March 2008. She returned to Radio 1 in September 2008. Cox went on maternity leave for the third time, after her show on 7 March 2010. Less than a week later, on 12 March, she announced that she had given birth to a girl.

On 23 June 2013, Cox tweeted a picture to announce she had just married her long-term boyfriend and fiancé Ben Cyzer.

=== Advocacy ===
Cox says that she is committed to protecting the environment. In 2009 she joined the 10:10 project in a bid to help her reduce her carbon footprint. She explained that, as she was brought up on a farm, she has no problem wearing extra layers instead of turning up the thermostat. Giving up meat was for her a different story, however, saying: &quot;My dad is a beef farmer so he wouldn&#x27;t be best pleased. I tried going veggie once, but it lasted about four hours.&quot;

In August 2014 Cox was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue. She revealed, when taking part in a one-off celebrity special of &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;, that she had voted against Brexit in 2016.

=== Privacy ===
In June 2003, Cox and her ex-husband Jon received £50,000 in an out-of-court settlement from the British newspaper &quot;The People&quot; after it printed photographs of her sunbathing naked on her honeymoon in 2001. Cox, who was photographed with a telephoto lens while on a private island, initially complained to the Press Complaints Commission, who found in her favour. &quot;The People&quot; printed an apology. Cox was unsatisfied, and sued the newspaper in the High Court for a breach of her right to privacy under the Human Rights Act.

&quot;The People&quot; agreed to an out of court settlement with Cox and her ex-husband before any judgement was made. Cox received £30,000 and he £20,000, &quot;The People&quot; also agreed to pay the couple&#x27;s legal costs, reported to be in excess of £100,000.

===Stalking incident===
In July 2017 a convicted child sex offender named Anthony Collins was convicted of stalking Cox, after sending her and her husband Ben a series of letters. He had sent the letters to her home address, which he reportedly obtained after purchasing the address for £17. He subsequently pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to 16 months in prison.

== Charitable activity ==
Cox was one of 52 celebrities contributing to a children&#x27;s story entitled &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; to promote a new charity directory inquiries number 118 520. The book will be auctioned with the profits going to the NSPCC. Cox is also a named supporter of the animal charity PDSA, and has promoted the charity by being photographed with her pet dog, Snoop, by the late Lord Lichfield.
Cox and other celebrities entered the women&#x27;s race (The Magnolia Cup) fundraising for the charity Great Ormond Street at Glorious Goodwood on 28 July 2011. She came ninth.

Cox has also been an ambassador for Centrepoint—the UK&#x27;s charity for homeless young people—since 2000, making her its longest serving celebrity supporter. She takes part in the charity&#x27;s flagship fundraising event, Sleep Out, every year, sleeping outside in a London location with around 800 other fundraisers. She also gives her time to Centrepoint for other events, messages of support and fundraising promotions.

In 2006, Cox participated as a celebrity showjumper in the BBC&#x27;s Sport Relief event &quot;Only Fools on Horses&quot;.

From 09:30 on 20 March 2017 to 09:30 on 21 March 2017, Cox did a 24-hour danceathon on her own on BBC Radio 2, raising money for Comic Relief, Red Nose Day. She raised over £800,000 for Red Nose Day according to the commentary on television and the newspaper &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
In November 2006, Cox was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bolton for contributions to broadcasting.

<doc id="636247" wikidata="Q6570166" url="?curid=636247" title="List of English words of Afrikaans origin">
<text>Words of Afrikaans origin have entered other languages. British English has absorbed Afrikaans words primarily via British soldiers who served in the Boer Wars. Many more words have entered common usage in South African English due to the parallel nature of the English and Afrikaner cultures in South Africa. Afrikaans words have unusual spelling patterns.

Most of these words describe the African flora, fauna or landscape.

==Internationally common==

* Afrikaans (noun: name of language, from &quot;african&quot;) derivative: Afrikaner (person who speaks Afrikaans as their native tongue), plural: Afrikaners
* apartheid (literally &quot;apart-ness&quot;): also the name of a period of segregation in the country during 1948–1994
* bergwind (warm dry wind blowing from the plateau to the coast)
* biltong (literally &quot;rump tongue/strip&quot;): dried cured red-meat, similar to Jerky. Has a boerewors equivalent known as Droëwors
* Boer (literally &quot;farmer&quot;): due to the large number of Afrikaans-speaking farmers, the term is exclusively used among Afrikaners for displaying national pride.
* boerewors (literally &quot;farmer&#x27;s sausage&quot;): a juicy mixed-spice and mixed-meat sausage
* Highveld: a raised plateau stretching from the eastern side of the Free State (province) up north including the provinces of Gauteng and North West. Due to its location in Gauteng, the city of Johannesburg is the highest urban settlement by elevation
* (literally &quot;yes&quot;)
* kraal (African village within a stockade, from Portuguese &quot;curral&quot;)
* kommando (originally a mounted infantry unit raised to retrieve stolen livestock)
* kop, or koppie (literally &quot;head&quot; or &quot;cup&quot;, an African monadnock): Koppie can also refer to a small hill.

<text>In Internet culture, a lurker is typically a member of an online community who observes, but does not participate by posting. The exact definition depends on context. Lurkers make up a large proportion of all users in online communities. Lurking allows users to learn the conventions of an online community before they participate, improving their socialization when they eventually &quot;de-lurk&quot;. However, a lack of social contact while lurking sometimes causes loneliness or apathy among lurkers.

Lurkers are referred to using many names, including browsers, read-only participants, non-public participants, legitimate peripheral participants, vicarious learners, or sleepers.

==History==
Since the beginning of computer-mediated communication lurking has been a concern for community members. The term &quot;lurk&quot; can be traced back to when it was first used during the 14th century. The word referred to someone who would hide in concealment, often for an evil purpose. In the mid-1980s, the word started to be applied to the Internet when bulletin board systems became popular. The bulletin boards were accessed through a single phone line that users would call to upload files and post comments to share with the community. It was expected that those using the system and consuming resources would contribute. Because lurkers would keep the phone line busy for extended periods of time without contributing anything, they were often viewed negatively and would be barred by the system operator who managed the BBS.

Today, lurkers are viewed both positively and negatively. In many communities lurkers are still seen as free-riders. They are perceived as a drain on the public goods since they &quot;take without giving back.&quot; However, some communities encourage newbies to lurk.
By lurking, newbies can learn more about the culture of the community, understand the community&#x27;s social norms, and become familiar with the key members of the community. Lurkers are also viewed positively in present-day communities because they provide an audience for the mass media. The presence of lurkers is often the justification for receiving advertising support.

Lurkers are often hard to track in computer-mediated communities. Because they are not posting and mostly just read content, they leave behind few traces that can be tracked. In open source project communities, it is estimated that at any point in time, 50% to 90% of the community may be lurkers. Depending on the community, this may be consistent with the 90-9-1 principle.

==Rationale==
Lurkers lurk rather than participate for a variety of reasons. A majority of lurkers profess that they lurk simply because they think that browsing is enough for them. Users also choose to lurk in order to find examples to follow when they decide to participate, avoid making redundant posts or contributions, and learn more about the topics of conversation. A lurker&#x27;s need to learn about the community before contributing also explains why almost twice as many users lurk on technical support communities where more information is required to post as compared to health support communities. Researchers have shown that different motivations underlie reading, contributing, and moderating web forums. Pure lurkers more often are motivated by the fact that the community is the only place to find a certain kind of content, while moderators and contributors are motivated by either duty or feelings of attachment. Lurking on social media can also be a form of receptive reading, whereby users seek to understand the opinions of those with a divergent point of view.
In much of the published literature, &quot;lurking&quot; is treated as a personal trait. However, concepts of legitimate peripheral participation and &quot;de-lurking&quot; suggest that lurking may be more situational than dispositional. In a study of online communities in which it was possible to see the total membership list, researchers were able to count the number of members who were public participants in one community while remaining silent or non-public participants in another community. 84% of the members fit this mixed pattern, indicating that people choose whether to lurk or to contribute on a per-community basis.

==Potential benefits==

===Lurker benefits===
Lurking behavior provides some benefits to users. Mo and Coulson found that lurkers on an online support group for HIV/AIDS did not differ from posters in their levels of care, self-efficacy, optimism, depression, and loneliness. They also found that lurkers felt more energetic than posters.

In a study that addressed lurking in E-learning, scholars found evidence that lurking is a helpful type of participation in online courses. Students said that the most common reasons they lurked before posting were to discover a message to reply to, to identify a model to adopt, to bypass providing a similar reply, and to acquire knowledge regarding the topic. Students in this study also expressed that they came back to read posts on online course discussion boards in order to check whether others had responded to their posts or to review a previous concept.

====Learning community social norms====
One reason lurkers lurk is the need to learn more about the group. In interviews, lurkers claim a lack of understanding of the community as a reason for not posting. Lurkers often take the time before posting to evaluate the group for how well it is a fit for them. Lurkers learn more about the individuals in the group, the dialogue styles, and the implicit norms and explicit policies. In the interviews, lurkers mentioned that this was their preferred method so that they could avoid making a mistake and being rejected by the group.
To determine if the group is a good fit and to learn more about the norms, lurkers will read most if not all of the posts. By reading the posts, lurkers develop a better understanding about the topics being discussed and if this is a good fit for them. Lurkers will also examine email addresses and signatures with associated websites so get a better understanding of the other members of the group.

By taking these steps, lurkers gain more cultural capital. Soroka and Raffaeli define cultural capital as &quot;the knowledge that enables an individual to interpret various cultural codes.&quot; In other words, it is the knowledge of the norms of the community. They found that people that lurk longer before posting had greater levels of cultural capital. A lurker can gain cultural capital in a community just by spending a lot of time in it. A person that has more cultural capital will benefit more from the community.

===Benefits for others===

In their study on interactive mailing lists, Takahashi, Fujimoto, and Yamasaki demonstrated that &quot;active lurkers&quot;, or individuals who spread content from an online group to individuals external to the online group, help spread beneficial information to surrounding communities.

Lurkers can also develop stores of valuable knowledge as they lurk which may be helpful later should they decide to contribute. For example, users in open source software communities can quickly discover the answers to common problems, making them more likely to contribute answers later. If they have already had a question answered, they are even more likely to de-lurk and reciprocate. These behaviors form the backbone of open source technical support.

Lurkers also help reduce the burden on communities. A person who may have a question for a community may be better served searching for the answer than forcing community members to expend effort to see and respond to their query. In the case of open source project communities, the vast majority of questions have already been asked and answered in the community, making any repeated questions wasted work.

Pragmatically, lurkers also provide revenue for communities as they access pages, generating advertising revenue.

==Potential costs==

===Lurker costs===
Lurkers experience less belonging in a community compared to regular contributors. They are less satisfied and experience more distractions. This means that lurkers are predisposed to leave before making a contribution because they lack the motivation that belonging and satisfaction bring. In the case of social networking websites, lurkers experience less intimacy and personal well-being. Lurkers in Facebook can experience loneliness as they watch other, more social members of the community participate.

===Costs for others===
Lurkers can also negatively influence other community members. If community members can see that someone is lurking rather than participating, they may feel that they are being spied upon. Lurkers might also take pieces of content featured in communities without seeking consent, violating the rules of the community. As a result, while individuals in online communities may feel that they are experiencing private interactions, a lurker may see it as a public space for observation due to their reduced feelings of belonging. This can become quite extreme in more intimate communities such as chat rooms where lurkers are more obvious. Hudson and Bruckman entered IRC chatrooms as experimenters and either posted a message stating they were logging the chat, an opt-in message for logging, and opt-out message, or nothing at all. 63.3% of chat rooms kicked out the experimenters after they gave any sort of message, demonstrating a dislike of explicit chat logging. However, 29% of rooms kicked out the experimenters even though they did not post anything, showing a disregard for lurkers.

====Free-riding====
Lurking is just one form of free-riding that can happen within an Internet community, and is similar to asking questions without responding, or gathering information without distributing it. Lurking is seen as undesirable to communities because of the risk free-riding can have on the community if every member does it. A public good is something that is impossible to exclude someone from and has a joint supply within the community. An Internet community is seen as a public good because it is a pool of data to which people may, if they choose, separately contribute information. The survival of the community is then dependent on the contributions of the members.
Since it is impossible to exclude members from sharing in the benefit of the public good, people are more motivated to free-ride on the work of the other members and not contribute themselves. As a group grows in size, the likelihood of free-riding increases. Individuals are less likely to contribute if they do not view their contribution as making a visible difference and if they expect the other members to provide enough content to reach the desired effect.
A lurker may withhold information because when they contribute, it benefits everyone in the community except for themselves. When everyone then chooses to withhold information, the collective benefit is no longer produced. With more people free-riding, it is more difficult to produce useful information and interactions among the group members. The group will then not have enough resources to attract new members and retain current members.
Lurking can also cost site holders money if they do not use advertising to generate revenue. The bandwidth costs of lurkers visiting a site may outstrip the value that donors or contributors provide to a community.

==Community factors==
Different factors in the community can influence the lurking behavior within that community. The amount of lurking within a community is correlated with the topic of the community, the size of the community, and the amount of traffic within the community. The number of lurkers is nearly double in technical support groups compared to health support groups. The nature of the topic may be responsible for the difference in the number of lurkers. The number of members in the community can also affect the amount of lurking that takes place. As the number of members in a group rises, the percentage of lurkers also rises. Within a given group size, the groups with higher traffic tend to have a lower percentage of lurkers.

==De-lurking==
When lurkers decide to participate in the community, they &quot;de-lurk,&quot; which Rafaeli, Ravid, and Soroka define as: &quot;...transfer from passive participation (only visiting the forum to read) to active participation (actively posting opinions and thoughts on the forum)&quot;.

===De-lurking and community acceptance===
In a series of studies investigating how newcomers learn the rules and habits of good users in four types of Usenet groups (i.e., health support, political issues, hobby, and technical groups), Burke, Kraut, and Joyce found correlational and experimental evidence that &quot;group-oriented membership claims&quot; or &quot;de-lurking messages&quot; were well received by previous community members. According to Burke et al., group-oriented membership claims are when new users introduce themselves to the online community by describing their undertakings in learning about the community; the authors provide the following example: &quot;I&#x27;ve been lurking around your discussion group for a few weeks now. Just reading and trying to soak in some knowledge I guess&quot;. Correlational results in Study 1 showed that messages with group-oriented membership claims elevated community member responses by 38 percent, while experimental results in Study 2 showed that placing group-oriented membership claims into Usenet posts elevated community member responses by 6 percent.

===Lurking to participation===
Some researchers have discovered positive links between social capital, cultural capital, and de-lurking. Others have identified psychological approaches to overcome the barriers to online participation.

According to Rafaeli et al., &quot;...community virtual social capital is &#x27;a collection of features of the social network created as a result of virtual community activities that lead to development of common social norms and rules that assist cooperation for mutual benefit&#x27;&quot; (p. 4). Through analyzing e-learning forums, Rafaeli et al. found a positive association between amounts of de-lurking and social capital. Soroka and Rafaeli claim that &quot;virtual cultural capital&quot; is &quot;...an extent to which a person has a reading-based knowledge about a virtual community&#x27;s culture and other participants, thus having much in common with them.&quot; By analyzing the Open University of Israel online forums and two IBM ReachOut online communities, Soroka and Rafaeli found that as users&#x27; cultural capital of an online community increases, their amount of activity increases, and they have a higher likelihood of de-lurking. Soroka and Rafaeli also found that irrespective of the amount of cultural capital, de-lurking becomes less likely as time passes.

The design and management of online communities can also affect de-lurking and participation. Resnick, Janney, Buis, and Richardson introduced a community element to the online walking program called Stepping Up to Health and discussed various issues of beginning an online community, including transforming lurkers into users. They discovered that posting contests (i.e., where users who made their first posts during a five-day period qualified to potentially win a prize) were a helpful mechanism to promote posting among lurkers. Similarly, Antin and Cheshire&#x27;s survey of lurkers suggests that reading behavior in Wikipedia is a sort of participation which helps new users to learn about the online community and advance toward more comprehensive participation.

While Rashid et al. did not examine lurkers directly, they conducted an experimental study on MovieLens that investigated how to raise low contribution rates in online communities. They discovered that participants showed a higher likelihood of rating movies when ratings were valuable to someone than when ratings were associated with the probability of having previously watched a movie. Furthermore, they found that participants showed an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when ratings were valuable to MovieLens subgroups than when ratings were valuable to the entire MovieLens online community, and participants demonstrated an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when ratings were valuable to individuals who liked similar movie genres as the participant than when ratings were valuable to individuals who liked dissimilar movie genres as the participant. These authors also found that participants demonstrated a reduced likelihood of rating movies when ratings were valuable to oneself than when ratings were valuable to someone else. Given these findings, Rashid et al. claim, &quot;…designers can use information about the beneficiaries of contributions to create subtle and integrated messages to increase motivation&quot;(p. 958).

==Methods used to study lurkers==
Because of the nature of the lurker, they can be hard to study. They do not leave visible traces and it is often difficult to address them directly. To study lurkers, often Internet communities such as email-based discussion lists, public forums, and community building tools will be targeted so communication can be tracked more easily.
Methods of studying lurkers include logging, questionnaires, interviews, observation, ethnography, and content and discourse analysis. Logging is a good tool for studying the number of lurkers in a community. It is easy to compare the number of lurkers between communities. Researchers can also collect information on the number of messages, the size of messages, the message content, and message threading. Questionnaires in contrast are better for asking the why and how of lurkers. There is less likely to be a response though because of the nature of lurkers and those that do respond may be a biased sample. Interviews are a good way to gain an understanding of the problem space. Interviews can also be used to answer the question of why and how lurkers lurk. The sampling must be done carefully or there could be a response bias. Observation is a good way to understand the context within the community. This method can be very intrusive though. If the observation is just on the community in general than no information may be gained about the lurkers because they are not visible. By observing a lurker, the tools and methods by which they lurk can be understood. Ethnography is better for understanding a single community but not multiple communities. It again is good for understanding the reasons and activities of lurking. Content and discourse analysis is a good tool to understand the interactions within a community. Since many lurkers do not publicly interact, this tool is better to use when understanding de-lurking.

<doc id="636250" wikidata="Q15789847" url="?curid=636250" title="Bricklin SV-1">
<text>The Bricklin SV-1 is a two-seat sports car produced by American businessman Malcolm Bricklin and his manufacturing company from 1974 until late 1975. The car was noteworthy for its gull-wing doors and composite bodywork of color-impregnated acrylic resin bonded to fiberglass. Assembly took place in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. The name &quot;SV-1&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;safety vehicle one&quot;. Bricklin company literature uses both the &quot;SV-1&quot; and &quot;SV1&quot; formats. To promote the car&#x27;s safety bona fides, the company touted such features as its integrated roll-over structure and energy-absorbing bumpers.

==Company history==
The SV-1 was the creation of Malcolm Bricklin. Prior to his Bricklin, built in New Brunswick, Canada, with a loan from the Provincial government, Bricklin is noted as the first businessman to import the Subaru brand into the U.S. in 1968. 
The Bricklin Canada assembly plant was located in the Grandview Industrial Park in Saint John, New Brunswick, at 150 Industrial Drive. A separate facility to produce the bodywork was in Minto, New Brunswick.

With the support of New Brunswick premier, Richard Hatfield, the provincial government provided $4.5 million of financing. The government believed that this money would be used to cover expenses incurred to begin the production of cars, when in fact it was used for the engineering and development of the car as well as salaries and operations of the Phoenix-headquartered company.

==Model history==

===Prototypes, design===
The SV-1 was the creation of American entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin, known in the industry for establishing Subaru of America prior to building the SV-1, and for importing Zastava cars to North America under the Yugo name afterwards.

Bricklin wanted to build a small, affordable sports car with gullwing doors. Power was to come from a four-cylinder engine from Opel. Bricklin entrusted design of a road-going proof-of-concept car to Bruce Meyers, but responsibility for the design soon transferred to Marshall Hobart. Dick Dean built the car, which was complete by December 1972. This car became known as the Grey Ghost. When completed the car had a six-cylinder Chrysler Slant-6 engine instead of a four. Other features included a rear suspension from a Datsun 510, a braking system that drew parts from Opel, Datsun and Toyota, and a tilting steering wheel from a Chevrolet.

In 1972 the Bricklin Vehicle Corporation began working with Herb Grasse Design and AVC Engineering to redesign and re-engineer the car. Three prototypes were built with assistance from AVC. AVC engineer Tom Monroe would later join Bricklin as Chief Engineer.

Design of the production SV-1 was done by Herb Grasse, a graduate of the ArtCenter College of Design who had earlier been employed by both Chrysler and Ford. Grasse had also worked with George Barris on the conversion of the 1955 Lincoln Futura show car into the television Batmobile.

It is claimed that Grasse opted to use the same taillamp units fitted to his personal DeTomaso Pantera for the Bricklin. These Carello units were also used on cars from Maserati and Lamborghini, but originally appeared on the Alfa Romeo 2000 Berlina.

The first of the original three prototypes became known as the Red Car. While some references say that it, like the Grey Ghost, had a Chrysler slant-6 engine, pictures exist of a Bricklin identified as the Red Car with an Argentine-sourced version of the Kaiser/Jeep Tornado inline six-cylinder engine from an IKA-Renault Torino installed. All subsequent prototypes had V8 engines. As many as eight prototypes were eventually built.

===Manufacturing===
The E.M.C. Company consulted on the plastic bodywork and built some prototype parts. Toolmaker Visioneering Inc. produced the master patterns for the molds using their new CNC equipment. E.M.C. expected to supply both the large panel press as well as a complete set of water-cooled cast aluminum molds for the 22 body-parts required for the Bricklin, but ultimately Bricklin only bought the press from E.M.C., opting to use epoxy molds for their bodywork.

Bricklin experienced persistent problems with the composite acrylic/fiberglass body panel technology. The acrylic resin first selected would blister at temperatures as low as . A substitute resin able to withstand higher temperatures was thinner than the original product, requiring an extra layer of fiberglass in the panel and increasing weight, so Bricklin reverted to the original resin. It was also discovered that ultraviolet light could pass through the acrylic layer, potentially degrading the polyester resins that were used to bond the acrylic to the fiberglass below.

To address these issues the company brought in polymer expert Archie Hamielec from McMaster University in Hamilton. A significant problem was lack of adhesion between the acrylic layer and the fiberglass. According to sources inside the company, as much as 60% of the acrylic used in the first few months of production was lost due to failures during the pressing and bonding stage, and another 10% was lost to damage during shipment of the parts from the Minto plant to Saint John. The only test for the integrity of the parts was one suggested by Albert Bricklin, Malcolm&#x27;s father, who proposed striking each part that came out of the presses with a seven pound hammer; if the part did not delaminate it passed. Even after an acceptable bonding method was found, in 1975 losses due to poor bonding continued to be 15% to 25% of the parts produced.

===Release===
The SV-1 was presented to a gathering of celebrities and potential dealers at the Riviera Hotel Las Vegas in February 1974. The official unveiling of the car took place at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York City on June 25, 1974.

===End of production===

Among the factors blamed for the car&#x27;s ultimate demise were ongoing quality control problems, nepotism, supplier shortages, worker absenteeism, and a series of price increases that more than doubled the price of the car in two years.

Production of the SV-1 ended with just under 3,000 cars built. An estimated 1,700 Bricklins were surviving as of 2012.

Consolidated Motors acquired the inventory of the defunct Bricklin company, among which were several partially assembled cars later completed by Consolidated and sold as 1976 models. Consolidated also built a small number of SV-1s up from bare chassis, which were also sold as 1976 models. Bricklin had incorporated some minor body changes in the car for 1976.

===Reviews and driving impressions===
In a test done by Car and Driver magazine in May 1975 the performance of the Bricklin was found to be comparable to the contemporary Corvette, the only other V8-powered 2-seat plastic-bodied North American sports car at the time. On the other hand, automotive critic Dan Neil found the car&#x27;s performance underwhelming due to its weight and named it to his 50 Worst Cars of All Time list, saying, &quot;This thing couldn&#x27;t outrun the Rose Bowl Parade.&quot;

===Commemorations===
*As part of a series commemorating Historic Land Vehicles, Canada issued the Bricklin Stamp on June 8, 1996. It had a face value of 45¢.
*In June 2003, the Canadian mint issued a $20 sterling silver Bricklin coin with selective gold plating.

==Technical features==
The SV-1 is a two-door, two-seat hatchback with gull-wing doors, hidden headlamps, and a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its bodywork is a composite material made up of acrylic resin bonded to a fibreglass substrate. The acrylic is impregnated with the body&#x27;s colour, which had the potential to reduce costs, as it eliminated the need for the factory to paint the cars in a separate step. The five &quot;Safety&quot; colours offered were one of the few options buyers had.

The doors, which weigh each, are raised by hydraulic cylinders controlled by switches in the interior, and take up to 12 seconds to open or close. The system is sensitive to the condition of the car&#x27;s battery, as well as being prone to breakdown. The system uses a single hydraulic pump and has no hydraulic interlock, so opening one door and closing the other at the same time has the potential to destroy the pump.

The Bricklin&#x27;s chassis is a steel perimeter frame with an integratal roll cage. The front and rear bumpers are designed to absorb the force of a impact.

The front suspension uses A-arms and coil springs and is made up of parts shared with a variety of existing AMC models. At the rear is a Hotchkiss system of leaf springs on a live axle.

Braking is by power-assisted discs in front and drums in back. Kelsey-Hayes provided the brake components for Bricklins built from 1974 to early 1975, after which the car used parts from Bendix.

Production Bricklins are powered by one of two OHV V8 engines, depending on the year of manufacture. Cars built in 1974 received a AMC V8 from American Motors. With a single four-barrel carburetor this engine produces and of torque. Transmission options for the year are a 3-speed Torque Command automatic (AMC&#x27;s rebranded TorqueFlite 727) or a BorgWarner T-10 4-speed manual. Of the 772 cars built in 1974, 137 received the manual. Cars built in 1975 mounted a Windsor V8 from Ford, a change which required an extensive redesign of the car&#x27;s subframe. With a single two-barrel carburetor this later engine produces and of torque. As Ford had no manual transmission EPA certified for the 351W engine, transmission options were limited to the Ford FMX 3-speed automatic.

The cars have no cigarette lighters or ashtrays. There is also no provision for a spare tire.

==Special models==
===Police cars===
In November 1974 Bricklin announced that they would supply five SV-1s to the police department in Scottsdale, Arizona. Only three 1974 cars were ultimately delivered. The cars were leased to the city for $1 each. The Bricklins had the same paint scheme as the department&#x27;s regular cruisers and a single beacon on the roof. The cars were used primarily for public relations events. Officers found them difficult to get in and out of, and the Arizona heat caused battery issues that would prevent the electrically operated doors from opening.

===The &quot;Chairman&quot;===
In 1975, in an effort to raise capital, development started on a more exclusive model to be called the &quot;Chairman&quot;. While mechanically similar to the existing car, Chairman cars were to have a larger engine than the stock SV-1. Visually they would be distinguished by black interior and a black body with gold stripes, gold coloured wheels and trim, and a gold-plated toolkit. The buyer was to be flown to the assembly plant to watch their car being built and receive a gold jumpsuit along with the car on delivery.

Two existing SV-1s were used to prototype the Chairman. Prototype #3 was used for the car&#x27;s exterior appearance, and SV-1 VIN #1339 was used for interior development. Work on the car began in Arizona in June 1975 and moved to Livonia by July. The Chairman did not reach production.

The unfinished interior model VIN #1339 was bought by former Bricklin Manufacturing Engineering manager Terry Tanner and completed in the style of a Chairman.

===Mini Bricklin===
In 1978 mini-car builder F.W. &amp; Associates offered a miniature version of the SV-1 to existing Bricklin owners through the pages of the Bricklin International quarterly magazine. The cars were powered by a Briggs &amp; Stratton gasoline engine and could be ordered in any of the Bricklin factory colours. List price was $550.00. The serial number of each mini-Bricklin was the same as that of the buyer&#x27;s full-size car.

==In the media==
*&quot;The Bricklin Story&quot; is a 30-minute promotional film produced in 1974 by Insight Productions with funding from Bricklin. It aired nationally on CBC and was roundly panned by critics.
*History Television and Barna-Alper Productions produced a documentary, &quot;The Premier, The Promoter &amp; Their Car&quot;, for its Turning Points of History series. The documentary explores the political fiasco that surrounded the Bricklin vehicle.
*Film company Cojak Productions and director Chris LeBlanc produced a dramatized retelling of the Bricklin saga titled &quot;La Légende Bricklin&quot;. Malcolm Bricklin returned to New Brunswick to shoot scenes where he played himself. Three Bricklins once owned by the Irving family were discovered in Halifax and were purchased for use in the film. The film aired on RDI and Radio-Canada on April 15, 2006.
*As part of its series &quot;Tout le monde en parlait&quot;, Société Radio-Canada presented a 30-minute documentary on the car that focused on its economic impact in 2013.
*Bricklin International member and New Brunswick resident Charlie Russell wrote a two-part song, &quot;The Bricklin&quot;, which takes a satirical view of the history of the car.
* In 2010, Theatre New Brunswick and The Playhouse (Fredericton) produced a musical, &quot;The Bricklin: An Automotive Fantasy&quot;, portraying the Bricklin story through funk music. An orange-colored Bricklin similar to Hatfield&#x27;s was used on stage during the show.
* In 2021, the Season 1 Episode 6 installment of &#x27;Seduced By Speed&#x27; produced by Motor Trend featured the Bricklin cars and interview footage with Malcolm Bricklin.

<text>The Carnatic region is the peninsular South Indian region between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal, in the erstwhile Madras Presidency and in the modern Indian states of Tamil Nadu and southern coastal Andhra Pradesh. During the British era, demarcation was different and the region included current-day Karnataka and the whole region south of the Deccan.

==Etymology==

A number of theories exist as to the derivation of the term &quot;Carnatic&quot; or &quot;Karnatic&quot;.

According to Bishop Robert Caldwell, in his &quot;Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages&quot;, the term is derived from &quot;Kar&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;nadu,&quot; &quot;country&quot;, i.e. &quot;the black country&quot;, which refers to the black soil prevalent on the plateau of the Southern Deccan.

When the English settled on the East Coast, all South India, from the river Krishna to Cape Comorin, was under the rule of a Kanarese dynasty, reigning at Vijayanagar, and was known as the Karnataka Realm. Hence the name &quot;Carnatic&quot; has come to be popularly applied to the coastal plains south of Madras, although these are Tamil-speaking
districts and quite outside the Kanarese country proper.

==Geography==

The region that was named Carnatic or Karnatak (Kannada, Karnata, Karnatakadesa) by Europeans lies between the Eastern Ghats and the Coromandel Coast in the presidency of Madras.

The name is applicable only to the country of the Kanarese extending between the Eastern and Western Ghats, over an irregular area narrowing northwards, from Palghat in the south to Bidar in the north including Mysore. The extension of the name to the country south of the Karnata was probably due to the Mahommedan conquerors who in the 16th century overthrew the kingdom of Vijayanagara and extended the name which they used for the country north of the Ghats to that south of them. After this period the plain country of the south came to be called Karnata Payanghat, or &quot;lowlands&quot;, as distinguished from Karnata Balaghat, or &quot;highlands.&quot; The misapplication of the name Carnatic was carried by the British a step further. Officially, however, this name is no longer applied, &quot;the Carnatic&quot; having become a mere geographical term. Administratively the name Carnatic (or rather Karnatak) is now applied only to the Bombay portion of the original Karnata, viz. the districts of Belgaum, Dharwar, and Bijapur, part of North Kanara, and the native states of the Southern Mahratta agency and Kolhapur.

===Sub-divisions===
The region generally known to Europeans as the Carnatic, not a political or administrative division, is of great historical importance. It extended along the eastern coast about 600 kilometers in length, and between 50 and 100 kilometers in breadth. It was bounded on the north by the Guntur circar, and thence it stretched southward to Cape Comorin. It was divided into the Southern, Central, and Northern Carnatic. The region south of the river Coleroon, passing the town of Trichinopoly, was called the &quot;Southern Carnatic&quot;. The principal towns of this division were Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Madurai, Tranquebar, Negapatam and Tinnevelly. The &quot;Central Carnatic&quot; extended from the Coleroon river to the river Pennar; its chief towns being Madras, Pondicherry, Arcot, Vellore, Cuddalore, Pulicat, Nellore and a few other towns. The &quot;Northern Carnatic&quot; extended from the river Pennar to the northern limit of the country, and the chief town was Ongole. The Carnatic, as above defined, comprehended within its limits the maritime provinces of Nellore, Chingleput, South Arcot, Tanjore, Madurai and Tinnevelly, besides the inland districts of North Arcot and Trichinopoly. The population of this region consisted chiefly of Brahmanical Hindus. Muslims were thinly scattered over the country.

==History==
In the earliest historical period, the area now known as the Carnatic was divided between the Pandya and Chola kingdoms, which with that of Chera dynasty or Kerala formed the three Tamil kingdoms of southern India. The Pandya kingdom practically coincided in extent with the districts of Madurai and Tinnevelly; that of the Cholas extended along the Coromandel coast from Nellore to Pudukottai, being bounded on the north by the Pennar River (Penner River) and on the south by the Southern Vellaru.

The government of the area was shared for centuries with these dynasties by numerous independent or semi-independent chiefs, evidence of whose perennial internecine conflicts is preserved in the multitudes of forts and fortresses, the deserted ruins of which crown almost all the elevated points. Despite this passion of the military classes for war, the Tamil civilization in the country was highly developed. This was sustained largely through the wealth of the country, famous in the earliest times as now for its pearl fisheries. Of this fishery, Korkai (the Greek KhXxot), now a village on the Tambraparni River in Tinnevelly but once the Pandya capital, was the centre long before the Christian era.

In Pliny&#x27;s day, owing to the silting up of the harbour, its glory had already decayed and the Pandya capital had been removed to Madurai, famous later as a centre of Tamil literature. The Chola kingdom, which four centuries before Christ had been recognized as independent by the Maurya king Ashoka, had for its chief port Kaviripaddinam at the mouth of the Kauvery, every vestige of which is now buried in the sand.

Tamil literature (particularly Iyal, in prose and poetry) contains in itself vast amounts of knowledge on Carnatic music. Starting from the earliest Tamil literature available today (around 200 BC), it is possible to trace the various forms of music (Isai) that had existed in different periods and the way it has transformed into today&#x27;s Carnatic music, by absorbing techniques from other Indian forms of music.

For the first two centuries after Christ, a large sea-borne trade was carried on between the Roman Empire and the Tamil kingdoms; but after Caracalla&#x27;s massacre at Alexandria in A.D. 215, this ceased, and with it all intercourse with Europe for centuries also. Henceforward, until the 9th century, the history of the country is illustrated only by occasional and broken lights.

The 4th century saw the rise of the Tamil Pallava power, which for some 400 years encroached on, without extinguishing, the other Tamil kingdoms. When in A.D. 640 the Chinese traveller Hsuan Tsang visited Kanchi (Conjevaram), the capital of the Pallava king, he learned that the kingdom of Chola (Chu-li-ya) embraced but a small territory, wild, and inhabited by a scanty and fierce population; in the Pandya kingdom (Malakuta), which was under Pallava suzerainty, literature was dead, Buddhism all but extinct, while Hinduism and the naked Jain saints divided the religious allegiance of the people, and the pearl fisheries continued to flourish.

The power of the Pallava kings was shaken by the victory of Vikramaditya Chalukya in AD 740, and shattered by Aditya Chola at the close of the 9th century. From this time onward, the inscriptional records are abundant. The Chola Dynasty, which in the 9th century had been weak, now revived, its power culminating in the victories of Rajaraja the Great, who defeated the Chalukyas after a four years war, and, about AD 994, forced the Pandya kings to become his tributaries. A magnificent temple at Tanjore, once his capital, preserves the records of his victories engraved upon its walls. His career of conquest was continued by his son Rajendra Choladeva I, self-styled Gangaikonda owing to his victorious advance to the Ganges, who succeeded to the throne in AD 1018. The ruins of the new capital which he built, called Gangaikonda Cholapuram, still stand in a desolate region of the Trichinopoly district. His successors continued the eternal wars with the Chalukyas and other dynasties, and the Chola power continued in the ascendant until the death of Kulottunga Chola III in 1278, when a disputed succession caused its downfall and gave the Pandyas the opportunity of gaining for a few years the upper hand in the south.

In 1310, however, the invasion under Malik Kafur overwhelmed the Hindu states of southern India in a common ruin. Though crushed, however, they were not extinguished; a period of anarchy followed, the struggle between the Chola kings and the Mussulmans issuing in the establishment at Kanchi of a usurping Hindu dynasty which ruled till the end of the 14th century, while in 1365 a branch of the Pandyas succeeded in re-establishing itself in part of the kingdom of Madurai, where it survived till 1623.

At the beginning of the 15th century, the whole country had come under the rule of the kings of Vijayanagar; but in the anarchy that followed the overthrow of the Vijayanagar empire by the Mussulmans in the 16th century, the Hindu viceroys (Nayaks) established in Madurai, Tanjore and Kanchi made themselves independent, only in their turn to become tributary to the kings of Golconda and Bijapur, who divided the Carnatic between them.

===Muslim era===

Towards the close of the 17th century, the northernmost part of The Carnatic region was reduced by the armies of Aurangzeb, who in 1692 appointed Zulfikar Ali, Nawab of the Carnatic, with his seat at Arcot. Meanwhile, the Marathas power had begun to develop; in 1677 Shivaji had suppressed the last remnants of the Vijayanagar power in Vellore, Gingee and Kurnool, while his brother Venkoji, who in 1674 had overthrown the Nayaks of Tanjavur, established in that city a dynasty which lasted for a century. The collapse of the Delhi power after the death of Aurangzeb produced further changes. The Nawab Saadet-Allah of Arcot (1710–1732) established his independence; his successor Dost Ali (1732–1740) conquered and annexed Madurai in 1736, and his successors were confirmed in their position as Nawabs of Northern Carnatic by the Nizam of Hyderabad after that potentate had established his power in South-Central India. After the death of Nawab Mahommed Anwar-ud-din (1744–1749), the succession was disputed between Mahommed Ali and Husein Dost. In this quarrel, the French and English, then competing for influence in the Carnatic, took opposite sides. The victory of the British established Mahommed Ali in power over northern Carnatic till his death in 1795. Meanwhile, however, the region had been exposed to other troubles. In 1741 Madurai, which the Nawab Dost Ali (1732–1740) had added to his dominions in 1736 after the demise of the Nayaks of Madurai, was conquered by the Marathas; and in 1743 Hyder Ali of Mysore overran and ravaged the central Carnatic. The latter was re-conquered by the British, to whom Madurai had fallen in 1758; and, finally, in 1801 all the possessions of the Nawab of Arcot were transferred to them by a treaty which stipulated that an annual revenue of several lakhs of pagodas should be reserved to the Nawab, and that the British should undertake to support a sufficient civil and military force for the protection of the country and the collection of the revenue. On the death of the Nawab in 1853, it was determined to put an end to the nominal sovereignty, a liberal establishment being provided for the family.

The rest of the Carnatic region, when first entered into by the British, was ruled by military chieftains called Poligars. In 1805, after the decisive defeat of the Poligars, the Poligar forts and military establishments were destroyed.

The Carnatic region was a place of Carnatic Wars between the Mughal Empire, Britain and France which ultimately led to British victory and the domination of the British Empire over India.

<text>Ainsley Denzil Dubriel Harriott (born 28 February 1957) is an English chef and television presenter. He is known for his BBC cooking game shows &quot;Can&#x27;t Cook, Won&#x27;t Cook&quot; and &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot;.

== Early life ==
Harriott was born in Paddington, London, to Peppy (née Strudwick) and pianist and singer, Chester Leroy Harriott (1933–2013). He has Jamaican heritage. Harriott attended Wandsworth Comprehensive School then trained at Westminster Kingsway College (formerly Westminster Technical College), and obtained an apprenticeship at Verrey&#x27;s restaurant in London&#x27;s West End, later working as a commis chef.

== Career ==
Harriott&#x27;s talents lie in comedy and singing as well as cooking. He formed the Calypso Twins with school friend Paul Boross, releasing a hit record in the early 1990s, &quot;World Party&quot;. The Calypso Twins were regular performers at the Comedy Store and Jongleurs; they also performed in America and on TV and radio shows. Harriott became head chef at the Long Room of Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground. He was asked to present &quot;More Nosh, Less Dosh&quot; on BBC Radio 5 Live, and also has appeared as an extra in Hale and Pace.

=== Television work ===

Harriott became the resident chef on &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot; and later the main presenter of &quot;Can&#x27;t Cook, Won&#x27;t Cook&quot; and originally a chef on &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot; before he went on to host it in 2000, both shows involving members of the public. He has presented more straightforward how-to-cook programmes such as &quot;Ainsley&#x27;s Barbecue Bible&quot;, &quot;Ainsley&#x27;s Meals in Minutes&quot;, &quot;Ainsley&#x27;s Big Cook Out&quot; and &quot;Ainsley&#x27;s Gourmet Express.&quot;

Harriott played the part of a GELF chief in the sci-fi comedy series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in 1993. In 1998, for the show&#x27;s 10th anniversary, Harriott presented a special edition of &quot;Can&#x27;t Cook, Won&#x27;t Cook&quot; called &quot;Can&#x27;t Smeg, Won&#x27;t Smeg&quot; with the cast of the show cooking a meal while remaining in character.

In 2000, Harriott made his debut on US television with The Ainsley Harriott Show, produced by Merv Griffin Entertainment and syndicated by Buena Vista Television, which ran for more than 100 episodes. Following this he went on to host &quot;Ready.. Set... Cook!&quot;, the US version of &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot;. Ainsley was guest chef on &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot; on 10 May 2009 and 21 February 2010 alongside guests JLS. In February 2010, Harriott joined the morning show &quot;GMTV with Lorraine&quot; featuring cookery recipes. From 2002 until 2007, Harriott appeared in TV adverts for Fairy Liquid.

In September 2008, Harriott took part in the genealogy documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. Harriott knew that his great-grandfather Ebenezer Harriott was in the colonial West India Regiment, and had assumed that they were descended from slaves. In Barbados, he confirmed that his great-grandfather had a distinguished military career, and learnt that he had fought on the side of the British in the Hut Tax War of 1898 – an increasingly violent series of protests against systems of taxation in Sierra Leone. Although Harriott had assumed that his great-great-grandfather, James Gordon Harriott, was a black slave, he was revealed to be the descendant of a long line of white slaveowners.

Harriott appeared in the final &quot;My Family&quot; Christmas special in 2010 &quot;Mary Christmas&quot;. On 11 August 2015, he was announced as the second contestant of the thirteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. On 5 September 2015 it was revealed Harriott was paired with professional dancer Natalie Lowe for the thirteenth series. He was the fourth contestant to be voted off and finished twelfth.

Harriott was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and the culinary arts.

=== Writing ===

Harriott is a best-selling author, publishing twelve books as well as numerous others in conjunction with his television shows. Including foreign-language translations, he has sold over 2 million books worldwide.

=== Other work ===
Harriott was the President of the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) 2004–05 and presented their awards ceremony that year. He markets his own range of food, including couscous, risotto, soups and cereal bars.

Harriott played the role of the Narrator in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; at the New Theatre, Cardiff in March 2010, at the Churchill Theatre, Bromley in October 2010, and again at the Richmond Theatre in November 2010.

He made a guest appearance in the BBC radio comedy series &quot;Giles Wemmbley Hogg Goes Off&quot; as himself in 2006.

In 2022 Harriot, along with others including the &quot;DIY SOS&quot; presenter Nick Knowles, helped to save his sister Jacqueline from drowning after she fell into a water feature at the Chelsea Flower Show.

In December 2023 Harriot won the Christmas special of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as Partridge (in a Pear Tree).

== Personal life ==
Harriott married former costume designer Clare Fellows, the youngest sister of comedian and actor Graham Fellows. They have two children. In November 2012, the couple were reported to have separated and they remain on good terms.

Harriott is a supporter of Arsenal F.C.

<doc id="636268" wikidata="Q317671" url="?curid=636268" title="Botnet">
<text>A botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&amp;C) software. The word &quot;botnet&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;network&quot;. The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation.

==Overview==
A botnet is a logical collection of Internet-connected devices, such as computers, smartphones or Internet of things (IoT) devices whose security have been breached and control ceded to a third party. Each compromised device, known as a &quot;bot,&quot; is created when a device is penetrated by software from a &quot;malware&quot; (malicious software) distribution. The controller of a botnet is able to direct the activities of these compromised computers through communication channels formed by standards-based network protocols, such as IRC and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Botnets are increasingly rented out by cyber criminals as commodities for a variety of purposes, including as booter/stresser services.

==Architecture==
Botnet architecture has evolved over time in an effort to evade detection and disruption. Traditionally, bot programs are constructed as clients which communicate via existing servers. This allows the bot herder (the controller of the botnet) to perform all control from a remote location, which obfuscates the traffic. Many recent botnets now rely on existing peer-to-peer networks to communicate. These P2P bot programs perform the same actions as the client–server model, but they do not require a central server to communicate.

===Client–server model===

The first botnets on the Internet used a client–server model to accomplish their tasks. Typically, these botnets operate through Internet Relay Chat networks, domains, or websites. Infected clients access a predetermined location and await incoming commands from the server. The bot herder sends commands to the server, which relays them to the clients. Clients execute the commands and report their results back to the bot herder.

In the case of IRC botnets, infected clients connect to an infected IRC server and join a channel pre-designated for C&amp;C by the bot herder. The bot herder sends commands to the channel via the IRC server. Each client retrieves the commands and executes them. Clients send messages back to the IRC channel with the results of their actions.

===Peer-to-peer===
In response to efforts to detect and decapitate IRC botnets, bot herders have begun deploying malware on peer-to-peer networks. These bots may use digital signatures so that only someone with access to the private key can control the botnet, such as in Gameover ZeuS and the ZeroAccess botnet.

Newer botnets fully operate over P2P networks. Rather than communicate with a centralized server, P2P bots perform as both a command distribution server and a client which receives commands. This avoids having any single point of failure, which is an issue for centralized botnets.

In order to find other infected machines, P2P bots discreetly probe random IP addresses until they identify another infected machine. The contacted bot replies with information such as its software version and list of known bots. If one of the bots&#x27; version is lower than the other, they will initiate a file transfer to update. This way, each bot grows its list of infected machines and updates itself by periodically communicating to all known bots.

==Core components==
A botnet&#x27;s originator (known as a &quot;bot herder&quot; or &quot;bot master&quot;) controls the botnet remotely. This is known as the command-and-control (C&amp;C). The program for the operation must communicate via a covert channel to the client on the victim&#x27;s machine (zombie computer).

===Control protocols===
IRC is a historically favored means of C&amp;C because of its communication protocol. A bot herder creates an IRC channel for infected clients to join. Messages sent to the channel are broadcast to all channel members. The bot herder may set the channel&#x27;s topic to command the botnet. For example, the message codice_1 from the bot herder alerts all infected clients belonging to #channel to begin a DDoS attack on the website www.victim.com. An example response codice_2 by a bot client alerts the bot herder that it has begun the attack.

Some botnets implement custom versions of well-known protocols. The implementation differences can be used for detection of botnets. For example, Mega-D features a slightly modified Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) implementation for testing spam capability. Bringing down the Mega-D&#x27;s SMTP server disables the entire pool of bots that rely upon the same SMTP server.

===Zombie computer===
In computer science, a zombie computer is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse and can be used to perform malicious tasks under remote direction. Botnets of zombie computers are often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service attacks (DDoS). Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to zombies. A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a zombie horde attack.

The process of stealing computing resources as a result of a system being joined to a &quot;botnet&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;scrumping&quot;.

Global law enforcement agencies, with the DOJ and FBI, dismantled the 911 S5 botnet, responsible for $5.9 billion in theft and various cybercrimes. Chinese national YunHe Wang, charged with operating the botnet, faces up to 65 years in prison. Authorities seized $60 million in assets, including luxury items and properties.

==Command and control==
Botnet command and control (C&amp;C) protocols have been implemented in a number of ways, from traditional IRC approaches to more sophisticated versions.

===Telnet===
Telnet botnets use a simple C&amp;C botnet protocol in which bots connect to the main command server to host the botnet. Bots are added to the botnet by using a scanning script, which runs on an external server and scans IP ranges for telnet and SSH server default logins. Once a login is found, the scanning server can infect it through SSH with malware, which pings the control server.

===IRC===
IRC networks use simple, low bandwidth communication methods, making them widely used to host botnets. They tend to be relatively simple in construction and have been used with moderate success for coordinating DDoS attacks and spam campaigns while being able to continually switch channels to avoid being taken down. However, in some cases, merely blocking of certain keywords has proven effective in stopping IRC-based botnets. The RFC 1459 (IRC) standard is popular with botnets. The first known popular botnet controller script, &quot;MaXiTE Bot&quot; was using IRC XDCC protocol for private control commands.

One problem with using IRC is that each bot client must know the IRC server, port, and channel to be of any use to the botnet. Anti-malware organizations can detect and shut down these servers and channels, effectively halting the botnet attack. If this happens, clients are still infected, but they typically lie dormant since they have no way of receiving instructions. To mitigate this problem, a botnet can consist of several servers or channels. If one of the servers or channels becomes disabled, the botnet simply switches to another. It is still possible to detect and disrupt additional botnet servers or channels by sniffing IRC traffic. A botnet adversary can even potentially gain knowledge of the control scheme and imitate the bot herder by issuing commands correctly.

===P2P===
Since most botnets using IRC networks and domains can be taken down with time, hackers have moved to P2P botnets with C&amp;C to make the botnet more resilient and resistant to termination.

Some have also used encryption as a way to secure or lock down the botnet from others, most of the time when they use encryption it is public-key cryptography and has presented challenges in both implementing it and breaking it.

===Domains===
Many large botnets tend to use domains rather than IRC in their construction (see Rustock botnet and Srizbi botnet). They are usually hosted with bulletproof hosting services. This is one of the earliest types of C&amp;C. A zombie computer accesses a specially-designed webpage or domain(s) which serves the list of controlling commands. The advantages of using web pages or domains as C&amp;C is that a large botnet can be effectively controlled and maintained with very simple code that can be readily updated.

Disadvantages of using this method are that it uses a considerable amount of bandwidth at large scale, and domains can be quickly seized by government agencies with little effort. If the domains controlling the botnets are not seized, they are also easy targets to compromise with denial-of-service attacks.

Fast-flux DNS can be used to make it difficult to track down the control servers, which may change from day to day. Control servers may also hop from DNS domain to DNS domain, with domain generation algorithms being used to create new DNS names for controller servers.

Some botnets use free DNS hosting services such as DynDns.org, No-IP.com, and Afraid.org to point a subdomain towards an IRC server that harbors the bots. While these free DNS services do not themselves host attacks, they provide reference points (often hard-coded into the botnet executable). Removing such services can cripple an entire botnet.

===Others===
Calling back to popular sites such as GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, the XMPP open source instant message protocol and Tor hidden services are popular ways of avoiding egress filtering to communicate with a C&amp;C server.

==Construction==
===Traditional===
This example illustrates how a botnet is created and used for malicious gain.

# A hacker purchases or builds a Trojan and/or exploit kit and uses it to start infecting users&#x27; computers, whose payload is a malicious application—the &quot;bot&quot;.
# The &quot;bot&quot; instructs the infected PC to connect to a particular command-and-control (C&amp;C) server. (This allows the botmaster to keep logs of how many bots are active and online.)
# The botmaster may then use the bots to gather keystrokes or use form grabbing to steal online credentials and may rent out the botnet as DDoS and/or spam as a service or sell the credentials online for a profit.
# Depending on the quality and capability of the bots, the value is increased or decreased.

Newer bots can automatically scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords. Generally, the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through, the more valuable it becomes to a botnet controller community.

Computers can be co-opted into a botnet when they execute malicious software. This can be accomplished by luring users into making a drive-by download, exploiting web browser vulnerabilities, or by tricking the user into running a Trojan horse program, which may come from an email attachment. This malware will typically install modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled by the botnet&#x27;s operator. After the software is downloaded, it will call home (send a reconnection packet) to the host computer. When the re-connection is made, depending on how it is written, a Trojan may then delete itself or may remain present to update and maintain the modules.

===Others===
In some cases, a botnet may be temporarily created by volunteer hacktivists, such as with implementations of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon as used by 4chan members during Project Chanology in 2010.

China&#x27;s Great Cannon of China allows the modification of legitimate web browsing traffic at internet backbones into China to create a large ephemeral botnet to attack large targets such as GitHub in 2015.

==Common uses==
* Distributed denial-of-service attacks are one of the most common uses for botnets, in which multiple systems submit as many requests as possible to a single Internet computer or service, overloading it and preventing it from servicing legitimate requests. An example is an attack on a victim&#x27;s server. The victim&#x27;s server is bombarded with requests by the bots, attempting to connect to the server, therefore, overloading it. Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has said that these types of attacks causing outages on major websites will continue to occur regularly due the use of botnets as a service.
* Spyware is software which sends information to its creators about a user&#x27;s activities – typically passwords, credit card numbers and other information that can be sold on the black market. Compromised machines that are located within a corporate network can be worth more to the bot herder, as they can often gain access to confidential corporate information. Several targeted attacks on large corporations aimed to steal sensitive information, such as the Aurora botnet.
* E-mail spam are e-mail messages disguised as messages from people, but are either advertising, annoying, or malicious.
* Click fraud occurs when the user&#x27;s computer visits websites without the user&#x27;s awareness to create false web traffic for personal or commercial gain.
*Ad fraud is often a consequence of malicious bot activity, according to CHEQ, Ad Fraud 2019, The Economic Cost of Bad Actors on the Internet. Commercial purposes of bots include influencers using them to boost their supposed popularity, and online publishers using bots to increase the number of clicks an ad receives, allowing sites to earn more commission from advertisers.
*Credential stuffing attacks use botnets to log in to many user accounts with stolen passwords, such as in the attack against General Motors in 2022.
* Bitcoin mining was used in some of the more recent botnets have which include bitcoin mining as a feature in order to generate profits for the operator of the botnet.
* Self-spreading functionality, to seek for pre-configured command-and-control (CNC) pushed instruction contains targeted devices or network, to aim for more infection, is also spotted in several botnets. Some of the botnets are utilizing this function to automate their infections.

==Market==
The botnet controller community constantly competes over who has the most bots, the highest overall bandwidth, and the most &quot;high-quality&quot; infected machines, like university, corporate, and even government machines.

While botnets are often named after the malware that created them, multiple botnets typically use the same malware but are operated by different entities.

==Phishing==
Botnets can be used for many electronic scams. These botnets can be used to distribute malware such as viruses to take control of a regular users computer/software By taking control of someone&#x27;s personal computer they have unlimited access to their personal information, including passwords and login information to accounts. This is called phishing. Phishing is the acquiring of login information to the &quot;victim&#x27;s&quot; accounts with a link the &quot;victim&quot; clicks on that is sent through an email or text. A survey by Verizon found that around two-thirds of electronic &quot;espionage&quot; cases come from phishing.

==Countermeasures==
The geographic dispersal of botnets means that each recruit must be individually identified/corralled/repaired and limits the benefits of filtering.

Computer security experts have succeeded in destroying or subverting malware command and control networks, by, among other means, seizing servers or getting them cut off from the Internet, denying access to domains that were due to be used by malware to contact its C&amp;C infrastructure, and, in some cases, breaking into the C&amp;C network itself. In response to this, C&amp;C operators have resorted to using techniques such as overlaying their C&amp;C networks on other existing benign infrastructure such as IRC or Tor, using peer-to-peer networking systems that are not dependent on any fixed servers, and using public key encryption to defeat attempts to break into or spoof the network.

Norton AntiBot was aimed at consumers, but most target enterprises and/or ISPs. Host-based techniques use heuristics to identify bot behavior that has bypassed conventional anti-virus software. Network-based approaches tend to use the techniques described above; shutting down C&amp;C servers, null-routing DNS entries, or completely shutting down IRC servers. BotHunter is software, developed with support from the U.S. Army Research Office, that detects botnet activity within a network by analyzing network traffic and comparing it to patterns characteristic of malicious processes.

Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are analyzing botnets&#x27; behavior by simultaneously running one million Linux kernels—a similar scale to a botnet—as virtual machines on a 4,480-node high-performance computer cluster to emulate a very large network, allowing them to watch how botnets work and experiment with ways to stop them.

Detecting automated bot becomes more difficult as newer and more sophisticated generations of bots get launched by attackers. For example, an automated attack can deploy a large bot army and apply brute-force methods with highly accurate username and password lists to hack into accounts. The idea is to overwhelm sites with tens of thousands of requests from different IPs all over the world, but with each bot only submitting a single request every 10 minutes or so, which can result in more than 5 million attempts per day. In these cases, many tools try to leverage volumetric detection, but automated bot attacks now have ways of circumventing triggers of volumetric detection.

One of the techniques for detecting these bot attacks is what&#x27;s known as &quot;signature-based systems&quot; in which the software will attempt to detect patterns in the request packet. However, attacks are constantly evolving, so this may not be a viable option when patterns cannot be discerned from thousands of requests. There is also the behavioral approach to thwarting bots, which ultimately tries to distinguish bots from humans. By identifying non-human behavior and recognizing known bot behavior, this process can be applied at the user, browser, and network levels.

The most capable method of using software to combat against a virus has been to utilize honeypot software in order to convince the malware that a system is vulnerable. The malicious files are then analyzed using forensic software.

On 15 July 2014, the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, held a hearing on the threats posed by botnets and the public and private efforts to disrupt and dismantle them.

The rise in vulnerable IoT devices has led to an increase in IoT-based botnet attacks. To address this, a novel network-based anomaly detection method for IoT called N-BaIoT was introduced. It captures network behavior snapshots and employs deep autoencoders to identify abnormal traffic from compromised IoT devices. The method was tested by infecting nine IoT devices with Mirai and BASHLITE botnets, showing its ability to accurately and promptly detect attacks originating from compromised IoT devices within a botnet.

Additionally, comparing different ways of detecting botnets is really useful for researchers. It helps them see how well each method works compared to others. This kind of comparison is good because it lets researchers evaluate the methods fairly and find ways to make them better.

==Historical list of botnets==
The first botnet was first acknowledged and exposed by EarthLink during a lawsuit with notorious spammer Khan C. Smith in 2001. The botnet was constructed for the purpose of bulk spam, and accounted for nearly 25% of all spam at the time.

Around 2006, to thwart detection, some botnets were scaling back in size.
*Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara took control of a botnet that was six times smaller than expected. In some countries, it is common that users change their IP address a few times in one day. Estimating the size of the botnet by the number of IP addresses is often used by researchers, possibly leading to inaccurate assessments.

<text>Jeremy Spake (born 1969) is a British television personality and presenter from Colchester, England.

==Career==
In 1996, Spake featured in the BBC documentary series &quot;Airport&quot;, where he worked as the ground services manager for Russian airline Aeroflot. His appearance on the programme brought him to wider public notice and celebrity. He subsequently featured in other programmes included &quot;The Toughest Job in Britain&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;The Angry Pirate&quot; and &quot;City Hospital&quot;. He also appeared in Moscow for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;2000 Today&quot; programme, broadcast over the turn of 2000. In 2008 he also featured in BBC documentary &quot;Return to... Airport&quot; which revisited the people who appeared in &quot;Airport&quot;.

Spake has written two books: &quot;Jeremy&#x27;s Airport&quot; and &quot;The Toughest Job in Britain&quot;. &quot;Jeremy&#x27;s Airport&quot; was based on his experiences working at Heathrow Airport as a Ground Services Manager for Aeroflot during the filming of the BBC series &quot;Airport&quot;. It describes a typical week in his job. Spake presented a series for BBC TV, &quot;The Toughest Job in Britain&quot; and his second book is based on the jobs he was filmed doing. Such jobs included replacing the bulbs on Blackpool Tower and work on a turkey farm.

In August 2018, Spake was confirmed as the deputy director of the Isle of Man Airport. In February 2022, the BBC announced that Spake would return to Heathrow Airport to present a new six-part documentary series, &quot;The Airport: Back in the Skies&quot;, for broadcast on BBC One from May 2022.

==Personal life==
Spake is a fluent Russian speaker. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Colchester Institute in 2014.

<text>The Vegetarian Society of the United Kingdom (VSUK) is a British registered charity. It campaigns for dietary changes, licenses Vegetarian Society Approved trademarks for vegetarian and vegan products, runs a cookery school and lottery, and organises National Vegetarian Week in the UK.

In the 19th century, various groups in Britain promoted meat-free diets, leading to the formation of the Vegetarian Society in 1847, which later split into the Manchester and London Vegetarian Societies in 1888 before reuniting in 1969, registering as a charity, and continued advocating for vegetarianism through public education and influencing food producers.

==Focus areas and activities==
The Vegetarian Society campaigns to encourage dietary changes, reduce meat consumption, and assist policymakers in developing a more compassionate food system.

In 1969, the Society introduced the Vegetarian Society Approved trademark. It launched a Vegetarian Society Approved vegan trademark in 2017. The trademarks are licensed to companies to display on products which contain only vegetarian or vegan ingredients, and also that nothing non-vegetarian or non-vegan was used during the production process. These trademarks can be seen on products in shops and supermarkets and also on dishes in restaurants. In 2022 McDonald&#x27;s launched their McPlant burger across the UK which is accredited with the Vegetarian Society Approved vegan trademark.

National Vegetarian Week is the charity&#x27;s flagship event. It started in 1992 as a single day and was expanded into a full week.

The Vegetarian Society Cookery School runs leisure classes in vegetarian and vegan cooking. It collaborates with various charities and community groups to provide tailored cookery courses. The school offers training for professional chefs and individuals seeking new careers in the food sector through its Professional Chef&#x27;s Diploma program.

==History==

===19th century===
In the 19th century, a number of groups in Britain actively promoted and followed meat-free diets. Key groups involved in the formation of the Vegetarian Society were members of the Bible Christian Church, supporters of the Concordium, and readers of the &quot;Truth-Tester&quot; journal.

====Bible Christian Church====
The Bible Christian Church was founded in 1809 in Salford by Reverend William Cowherd after a split from the Swedenborgians. One distinctive feature of the Bible Christians was a belief in a meat-free diet, or ovo-lacto vegetarianism, as a form of temperance.

====Concordium (Alcott House)====
The Concordium was a boarding school near London on Ham Common, Richmond, Surrey, which opened in 1838. Pupils at the school followed a diet completely free of animal products, known today as a vegan diet. The Concordium was also called Alcott House, in honour of American education and food reform advocate Amos Bronson Alcott.

====&quot;Truth-Tester&quot; and Physiological Conference, 1847====
The &quot;Truth-Tester&quot; was a journal which published material supporting the temperance movement. In 1846 the editorship was taken over by William Horsell, operator of the Northwood Villa Hydropathic Institute in Ramsgate. Horsell gradually steered the &quot;Truth-Tester&quot; towards promotion of the &quot;Vegetable Diet&quot;. In early 1847 a letter to the &quot;Truth-Tester&quot; proposed the formation of a Vegetarian Society. In response to this letter, William Oldham held what he called a &quot;physiological conference&quot; in July 1847 at the Concordium. Up to 130 attended, including Bible Christian James Simpson, who presented a speech. The conference passed a number of resolutions, including a resolution to reconvene at the end of September.

====Ramsgate Conference, 1847====

On 30 September 1847 the meeting which had been planned at the Physiological Conference took place at Northwood Villa Hydropathic Institute in Ramsgate. Joseph Brotherton, MP for Salford, and a Bible Christian chaired. James Simpson was elected president of the society, Concordist William Oldham elected treasurer, and &quot;Truth-Tester&quot; editor William Horsell elected secretary. The name &quot;Vegetarian Society&quot; was chosen for the new organisation by a unanimous vote.

====After Ramsgate====
The Vegetarian Society&#x27;s first full public meeting was held in Manchester the following year, attracting 265 members aged 14 to 76, with 232 attending the dinner following the meeting. In 1853 it already had 889 members.

In 1849, London&#x27;s vegetarians gathered and resolved to enhance the spread of vegetarianism in the capital. Consequently, in September 1849, they launched &quot;The Vegetarian Messenger&quot;, a journal that distributed almost 5,000 copies monthly at a cost of one penny each. The society made available publications on the topic sometimes accompanied by lectures.

Following the deaths of Simpson, Brotherton, and their American colleague Alcott, the vegetarian movement experienced a sharp decline. Membership numbers fell significantly during the 1860s and 1870s, with only 125 members remaining by 1870.

====London Food Reform Society====

The London Food Reform Society, founded in 1875 with the help of Martin Nunn, an advocate of cooperation and industrial reform, held free bi-monthly lectures and debates at Franklin Hall, attracting increasing audiences due to support from eager young men and notable food reformers.

The Society&#x27;s Food Reform Magazine subtly criticised the Vegetarian Society in Manchester for not being supportive enough. While Manchester believed its organisation was sufficient, London vegetarians, often new converts, disagreed and considered relocating the national offices to London. Debates in 1882 and 1883 on expanding to a national scope faced criticism due to potential hostility and funding issues. The Society briefly renamed itself the National Food Reform Society until October 1885 when the Vegetarian Society paid its debts and made it an auxiliary in London. This led to the loss of the Food Reform Society&#x27;s subscription list interest, office closure, and establishment of an independent auxiliary. W. J. Monk was its president. The Vegetarian Society&#x27;s London Auxiliary became an independent body under the name London Vegetarian Society in 1888.

====Dietary policy debates and growth====

From its founding, the Society was primarily influenced by members of the Bible Christian Church in Salford, who advocated for the inclusion of eggs, dairy products, and honey in their diet based on biblical teachings. They had no plans to reduce the consumption of these animal products. In contrast, Henry Stephens Salt argued in his 1885 work &quot;A Plea for Vegetarianism&quot; that the main goal of vegetarians should be to abolish flesh-meat while acknowledging that dairy and eggs were also unnecessary and could be eliminated in the future. Salt emphasised rejecting unhealthy, expensive, and unwholesome food rather than just animal products.

Francis William Newman served as president of the Vegetarian Society from 1873 to 1883. He made an associate membership possible for people who were not completely vegetarian, such as those who ate chicken or fish. Newman was critical of raw food vegetarianism which he rejected as fanatical. He believed that abstinence from meat, fish and fowl should be the only thing the Society advocates and that it should not be associated with other reform ideas. He was also against the abandonment of salt and seasonings.

Under Newman&#x27;s presidency the Society flourished as income, associates and members increased. From 1875 to 1896 membership for the Society rose to 2,159 and associate membership 1,785. Around 1897 its membership was about 5,000. In regard to the associate membership, Newman commented:

====Manchester and London Vegetarian Societies====

Relations between the Society in Manchester and the London branch were strained due to differing definitions of vegetarianism and conflicts over required approval of &quot;advanced&quot; literature by the Society. In 1888, the London branch split, forming the London Vegetarian Society (LVS), also known as the London Vegetarian Association. After this, the Vegetarian Society was often referred to as the Manchester Vegetarian Society (MVS).

The first President of the LVS was raw food advocate Arnold Hills, and other members included Thomas Allinson and Mahatma Gandhi. Members of the LVS were considered more radical than the MVS.

The newly independent society&#x27;s ambitions were laid out in its journal, &quot;The Vegetarian&quot;, funded by Arnold Hills. Despite challenges, optimism prevailed with plans for a Charing Cross Vegetarian Hotel and Restaurant. Several branches existed, attracting new members in Oxford, Nottingham, Brighton, Guildford, and Reading. In 1889, the LVS and &quot;Vegetarian&quot; offices moved to the Congregational Memorial Hall, becoming a hub for reform activities. The movement&#x27;s growth led to specialist societies for children, athletes, and others, with vegetarian restaurants serving as meeting places. In 1889, the LVS created a national Vegetarian Federal Union, despite controversy from the MVS. By 1901, 21 societies had been established, coordinated from 1895 by the LVS.

===20th century===

In 1907, James Christopher Street, J. Stenson Hooker, Ernest Nyssens and Eustace Miles were speakers at the 60th Anniversary of the Vegetarian Society in Manchester. In 1920, the MVS hosted a summer school at Arnold House, Llanddulas, attracting around 70 attendees each week. Both societies organised holidays and outings for vegetarians, with the MVS&#x27;s May meetings remaining popular annual events well after World War II.

World War I was a challenging period for vegetarians; no allowance was made for vegetarians in the armed forces.

In World War II, the Committee of Vegetarian Interests was established, comprising members from the two Vegetarian Societies, health food manufacturers, and retailers, to negotiate with the Ministry of Food. During WWII, the blockade of the UK lead to food shortages, and the government became intimately involved in the diet of the civilian population. Food was rationed, with ration coupons becoming a second currency needed to buy all rationed goods. Vegetarians were well-catered for. Anyone who registered as vegetarian with their local Food Office got special ration books. These had no meat ration; instead, there were more ration coupons for cheese, eggs, and nuts. There were about 100,000 people officially registered as vegetarians in the UK during WWII.

Meat rations during the war were very small (in order to increase the food supply; see trophic level). Many meals had to be vegetarian, and the government promoted vegetarian recipes. The whole population ate much more cereals and vegetables, and much less meat. Many retained wartime eating habits after the war. There was also great public interest in nutrition and diets, and the effects of eating less meat.

The 1950s saw a significant rise in the popularity of vegetarian cuisine. Walter Fleiss, who owned the well-known Vega restaurant near Leicester Square in London, successfully lobbied for the inclusion of a vegetarian category in the Salon Culinaire Food Competition. Sponsored by the Society, this event and subsequent ones brought vegetarianism into mainstream awareness.

====Founding of The Vegan Society====
The inclusion of eggs and dairy in a vegetarian diet was a long-standing topic of debate within the Society. In 1944, Donald Watson, a member of the LVS, suggested creating a separate group for those adhering to a dairy- and egg-free diet. This led to the establishment of The Vegan Society.

====Reunification====
In the 1950s and 1960s, former rivalries were put aside as the MVS and LVS started working together, with many calling for unification. In 1958, their magazines combined to become &quot;The British Vegetarian&quot;. They reunited in 1969, forming the Vegetarian Society of the United Kingdom. Their headquarters were established at Parkdale, Altrincham, Greater Manchester. The organisation became a registered charity in September of that year.

====Advocacy efforts====
In the 1950s, Frank Wokes founded the Vegetarian Nutritional Research Centre in Watford, working closely with the Society to promote research on vegetarian nutrition and health. The centre was eventually absorbed by the Society, leading to extensive research efforts, with results published in major journals, magazines, and newspapers.

In 1969, the Society introduced its seedling logo. In 1986, they introduced a scheme allowing manufacturers to use their logo on foods that met their strict vegetarian guidelines. Their accreditation criteria states that the food must be: free from animal flesh, slaughterhouse byproducts, and cross-contamination with non-vegetarian products; not tested on animals; only GMO-free and free-range eggs (with specific humane standards) are used. This initiative led to the widespread use of vegetarian symbols on food packaging.

In 1982, The Vegetarian Society launched The Cordon Vert Cookery School, a leading vegetarian culinary academy. In 1991, the Society hosted the first National Vegetarian Week, an event that has been held nearly every year since, gaining significant media attention and attracting many to vegetarianism. Vegfest, introduced in 1997, is an annual celebration in central Manchester, drawing thousands of attendees.

In 1995, the Society produced the documentary &quot;Devour the Earth&quot;, written by Tony Wardle and narrated by Paul McCartney. McCartney became a patron of the society in the same year.

===21st century===
The Vegetarian Society Awards were inaugurated in 2001 to acknowledge businesses and services that cater to the UK&#x27;s population of vegetarians. The first ceremony took place at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London, with later events at The Waldorf Hotel and The Magic Circle headquarters. These early events, open to members and the public, included fundraising activities such as celebrity auctions and raffles, with prizes donated by vegetarian-friendly companies, to support the Society&#x27;s educational initiatives.

In 2003, the Society launched a &quot;Fishconception&quot; campaign after a survey revealed that many restaurants, canteens, and hospitals mistakenly believed that vegetarians eat fish. The campaign aimed to correct this misconception and guide the catering industry on vegetarian standards.

In 2017, the Vegetarian Society launched Veggie Lotto, the first vegetarian and vegan lottery in the UK. Tickets are priced at £1, with 50p allocated to the society. Funds raised support training for caterers, free courses for community groups and vulnerable individuals, and the promotion of vegetarian and vegan food.

Historian Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska has noted that &quot;against the background of growing concern about the environment, animal rights, and food safety the society has flourished in recent decades.&quot;

In 2024, the Vegetarian Society announced a rebrand. It has a new logo, rebranded magazine and website. In the same year, the Society moved its head office to Ancoats, Manchester.

==Publications==

The Vegetarian Society first published &quot;The Vegetarian Messenger&quot; (1849–1860). It became &quot;The Dietetic Reformer and Vegetarian Messenger&quot; (1861–1897), &quot;The Vegetarian Messenger and Health Review&quot; (1898–1952), &quot;The Vegetarian&quot; (1953–1958) and &quot;The British Vegetarian&quot; (1959–1971). In 1885, Beatrice Lindsay, a graduate from Girton College, Cambridge, became the first female editor of the Vegetarian Society&#x27;s &quot;Dietetic Reformer and Vegetarian Messenger&quot;. Early vegetarian writers for the &quot;Dietetic Reformer and Vegetarian Messenger&quot; in the 1870s and 1880s advocated biological evolution and reshaped it into a teleological progress.

&quot;The Pod&quot;, formerly &quot;The Vegetarian&quot;, is the membership magazine of the Vegetarian Society and continues to be produced three times a year.

==Presidents==

==Patrons==
The Vegetarian Society has had several notable patrons. Rose Elliot, who became a patron in 2002, is an author of over fifty vegetarian cookbooks and received an MBE in 1999. Actor Jerome Flynn became a patron after adopting a vegetarian lifestyle at 18. Musician Paul McCartney and his late wife Linda became patrons in 1995. Fashion designer Stella McCartney and photographer Mary McCartney joined their parents as patrons. Television presenter Wendy Turner-Webster, a vegan, became a patron in 2004, promoting an animal-free diet.
