<text>Maid Marian is the heroine of the Robin Hood legend in English folklore, often taken to be his lover. She is not mentioned in the early, medieval versions of the legend, but was the subject of at least two plays by 1600. Her history and circumstances are obscure, but she commanded high respect in Robin’s circle for her courage and independence as well as her beauty and loyalty. For this reason, she is celebrated by feminist commentators as one of the early strong female characters in English literature.

==History==

Maid Marian (or Marion) is never mentioned in any of the earliest extant ballads of Robin Hood. She appears to have been a character in May Games festivities (held during May and early June although it could be rarely held mid June, most commonly around Whitsun) and is sometimes associated with the Queen or Lady of May or May Day. In &quot;The Quest for Robin Hood&quot;, Jim Lees suggests that Maid Marian was originally a personification of the Virgin Mary. Both a &quot;Robin&quot; and a &quot;Marian&quot; character were associated with May Day by the 15th century, but these figures were apparently part of separate traditions; the Marian of the May Games is likely derived from the French tradition of a shepherdess named Marion and her shepherd lover Robin, recorded in Adam de la Halle&#x27;s &quot;Le Jeu de Robin et Marion&quot;, circa 1283. It isn&#x27;t clear if there was an association of the early &quot;outlaw&quot; character of Robin Hood and the early &quot;May Day&quot; character Robin, but they did become identified, and associated with the &quot;Marian&quot; character, by the 16th century. Alexander Barclay, writing in c. 1500, refers to &quot;some merry fytte of Maid Marian or else of Robin Hood&quot;. Marian remained associated with May Day celebrations even after the association of Robin Hood with May Day had again faded. The early Robin Hood is also given a &quot;shepherdess&quot; love interest, in &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Birth, Breeding, Valor, and Marriage&quot; (Child Ballad 149), his sweetheart is &quot;Clorinda the Queen of the Shepherdesses&quot;. Clorinda survives in some later stories as an alias of Marian. Francis James Child notes that the early mentions of Friar Tuck (another May Games character) are in association with Marian. By the mid 16th century the May Games had become increasingly bawdy, and in one play Robin even gives Marian to Friar Tuck as a concubine: &quot;She is a trul of trust, to serue a frier at his lust/a prycker a prauncer a terer of shetes/a wagger of ballockes when other men slepes.&quot;

The &quot;gentrified&quot; Robin Hood character, portrayed as a historical outlawed nobleman, emerges in the late 16th century. From this time, Maid Marian is cast in terms of a noblewoman, but her role was never entirely virginal, and she retained aspects of her &quot;shepherdess&quot; or &quot;May Day&quot; characteristics; in 1592, Thomas Nashe described the Marian of the later May Games as being played by a male actor named Martin, and there are hints in the play of Robin Hood and the Friar that the female character in these plays had become a lewd parody. Robin originally was called Ryder.

In the play, &quot;The Downfall of Robert, Earl of Huntingdon&quot; by Anthony Munday, which was written in 1598, Marian appears as Robin&#x27;s lawfully-wedded wife, who changes her name from Matilda when she joins him in the greenwood. She also has a cousin called Elizabeth de Staynton who is described as being the Prioress of Kirklees Priory near Brighouse in West Yorkshire. The 19th century antiquarian, Joseph Hunter, identified a Robert Hood, yeoman from Wakefield, Yorkshire, in the archives preserved in the Exchequer, whose personal story matched very closely the story of Robin in Anthony Munday&#x27;s play, and this Robert Hood also married a woman named Matilda, who changed her name to Marian when she joined him in exile in Barnsdale Forest (following the Battle of Boroughbridge) in 1322, and who also had a cousin named Elizabeth de Staynton who was Prioress of Kirklees Priory. If these parallels are not coincidental, then the Marian of Robin Hood fame, whose origins may be distinct from the Marian of the May games or of Monday&#x27;s play, may derive all her roots from her association with the historical Robert Hood of Wakefield.

In an Elizabethan play, Anthony Munday identified Maid Marian with the historical Matilda, daughter of Robert Fitzwalter, who had to flee England because of an attempt to assassinate King John (legendarily attributed to King John&#x27;s attempts to seduce Matilda). The &quot;Matilda&quot; theory of Maid Marian is further discussed in In later versions of Robin Hood, Maid Marian is commonly named as &quot;Marian Fitzwalter&quot;, only child of the Earl of Huntingdon, is the Maid Marian

In &quot;Robin Hood and Maid Marian&quot; (Child Ballad 150, perhaps dating to the 17th century), Maid Marian is &quot;a bonny fine maid of a noble degree&quot; said to excel both Helen and Jane Shore in beauty. Separated from her lover, she dresses as a page &quot;and ranged the wood to find Robin Hood,&quot; who was himself disguised, so that the two begin to fight when they meet. As is often the case in these ballads, Robin Hood loses the fight to comical effect, and Marian only recognizes him when he asks for quarter. This ballad is in the &quot;Earl of Huntington&quot; tradition, a supposed &quot;historical identity&quot; of Robin Hood forwarded in the late 16th century.

20th-century pop culture adaptations of the Robin Hood legend almost invariably have featured a Maid Marian and mostly have made her a highborn woman with a rebellious or tomboy character. In 1938&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, she is a courageous and loyal woman (played by Olivia de Havilland), and a ward of the court, an orphaned noblewoman under the protection of King Richard. Although always ladylike, her initial antagonism to Robin springs not from aristocratic disdain but from aversion to robbery.

In &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952), she, despite being a lady-in-waiting to Eleanor of Aquitaine during the Crusades, is in reality a mischievous tomboy capable of fleeing boldly to the countryside disguised as a boy.
In the Kevin Costner epic &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, she is a maternal cousin to the sovereign, while in the BBC adaption of 2006, she is the daughter of the former sheriff and was betrothed to Robin before his leaving for the Holy Land, and in his absence embarked on her own crusade against poverty in aiding the poor in a fashion similar to what Robin later achieved, becoming a skilled fighter in the process and leading the people to refer to her as &#x27;The Night Watchman&#x27;.

Maid Marian&#x27;s role as a prototypical strong female character has made her a popular focus in feminist fiction. Theresa Tomlinson&#x27;s &quot;Forestwife&quot; novels (1993–2000) are told from Marian&#x27;s point of view and portray her as a high-born Norman girl escaping entrapment in an arranged marriage. With the aid of her nurse, she runs away to Sherwood Forest, where she becomes acquainted with Robin Hood and his men.

* Maid Marian was played first by Bernadette O&#x27;Farrell, and then by Patricia Driscoll in the 1955 series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and was as adept with the bow as Robin. As Lady Marian Fitzwater, a Norman-Irish noblewoman, she rode a horse sidesaddle and when dressed in Lincoln Green with Robin in Sherwood Forest she rode astride. The Sheriff was always ready to defend her, but his replacement the Deputy Sheriff suspected she was one of Robin&#x27;s band.

When Robin died, she was pardoned by King John. When she attended a party at the Earl of Huntington&#x27;s residence, she was wooed by his son Robert of Huntingdon (played by Jason Connery). He became Robin&#x27;s successor as Herne&#x27;s Son and leader of the outlaws. Robert (Robin) and Marion nearly marry until she mistakenly believes him to have been killed. She then decides to become a nun for the foreseeable future, believing that is the right, and only thing worth doing.
* Maid Marian was the lead character in Tony Robinson&#x27;s 1989 BBC children&#x27;s comedy &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot;. In the show, Marian (played by Kate Lonergan) was portrayed as the real leader of the Merry Men, whilst Robin was a vain coward who was mistakenly believed to be the leader by King John and the Sheriff of Nottingham.

She is involved in a love triangle, with Sir Guy of Gisbourne and Robin as her suitors.
* Maid Marian appears in the &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; episode &quot;Lacey&quot; played by Christie Laing. Maid Marian is the target for the affection of the Sheriff of Nottingham. She runs away with Robin Hood after falling in love with him (and later marrying him). Sometime later, Marian is pregnant and falls ill, causing Robin to obtain a magic wand from Rumplestiltskin&#x27;s castle to heal her. After successfully curing her, Rumplestiltskin takes Belle to witness him killing Robin for stealing from him. However, after seeing the restored Marian and realizing her pregnancy, Belle begs Rumplestiltskin not to kill him or else the child would become fatherless. Rumplestiltskin purposely misses shooting him, alarming the pair to escape the woods. In &quot;Quite a Common Fairy,&quot; a discussion between Robin and Rumplestiltskin&#x27;s son Baelfire revealed that Maid Marian has died leaving Robin and his Merry Men into taking care of their child Roland. In &quot;Snow Drifts&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like Home,&quot; Emma Swan and Killian Jones travel back in time, and when Emma discovers a woman is about to be killed by the Evil Queen, she wants to save her but Jones worries about consequences. Emma is later imprisoned with the woman but both escape and return to the present day. Only after that do they discover that the woman is Marian, and Regina is furious that her new boyfriend Robin has his wife back. Though he wants to be with Regina, Robin and his family leave town in an effort to save Marian&#x27;s life from a magical illness and then reside in New York. Regina later discovers Marian was killed in the past by her half-sister Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West who has been posing as Marian ever since. Regina and Emma rush to New York and reveal the truth only to be informed by Robin that Zelena is pregnant.
* In 2014, Maid Marian is portrayed by Sabrina Bartlett in an episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; called &quot;Robot of Sherwood&quot;, with the Twelfth Doctor saving her from the Sheriff&#x27;s dungeons before he learns of her identity or accepts that Robin is real.

<text>Brian Michael Bendis (; born August 18, 1967) is an American comic book writer and artist.

Starting with crime and noir comics, Bendis eventually moved to mainstream superhero work. While at Marvel Comics, Bendis worked with Bill Jemas and Mark Millar as the writer on the first book of the Ultimate Marvel imprint, &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, which debuted in 2000. He relaunched the Avengers franchise with &quot;New Avengers&quot; in 2004, wrote the Marvel storylines &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; (2004-2005), &quot;Secret War&quot; (2004–2005), &quot;House of M&quot; (2005), &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; (2008), &quot;Siege&quot; (2010) and &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; (2013), and co-created the characters Riri Williams, Miles Morales, and Jessica Jones.

Bendis has won five Eisner Awards for both his creator-owned work and his work on various Marvel Comics books.

Though he has cited comic book writers such as Frank Miller and Alan Moore, Bendis&#x27; writing influences are less rooted in comics; drawing on the work of David Mamet, Richard Price, and Aaron Sorkin, whose dialogue, Bendis said, was &quot;the best in any medium.&quot;

In addition to writing comics, Bendis has worked in television, video games and film. He has also taught courses on graphic novels at The University of Oregon and Portland State University. In 2014, Bendis wrote &quot;Words for Pictures: The Art and Business of Writing Comics and Graphic Novels,&quot; a book about comics published by Random House.

==Early life==
Brian Michael Bendis was born on August 18, 1967, in Cleveland, Ohio to a Jewish-American family. Bendis grew up in University Heights where, despite rebelling against a religious upbringing, he attended the Hebrew Academy of Cleveland, a private, modern Orthodox religious school for boys. He decided he wanted to be a comic book industry professional when he was 13, working on his own comics, including a &quot;Punisher versus Captain America&quot; story that he revised several times. A fan of Marvel Comics in particular, he emulated idols such as George Pérez, John Romita Sr., John Romita, Jr., Jack Kirby, Klaus Janson and Frank Miller. He later discovered crime comics by Jim Steranko and José Muñoz, which he traced back via Jim Thompson&#x27;s work to the source novels of both Thompson and Dashiell Hammett, which helped cement his love for crime stories. These, in turn, led him to discover the documentary &quot;Visions of Light&quot;, which taught him the visual &quot;rules&quot; of film noir, an important influence on him creatively.

While in high school, he submitted a &quot;Creative Writing assignment&quot;, a novelization of Chris Claremont&#x27;s &quot;X-Men and the Starjammers&quot; story, which gained him an A+ grade for imagination and inventiveness. At 19, Bendis began attending the Cleveland Institute of Art, while working at a downtown comic book store where he eventually sold some of his early work. Between the ages of 20 and 25, he sent in a large number of submissions to comics companies, although he ultimately abandoned this approach to breaking into the industry, considering it too much of a &quot;lottery.&quot;

==Comics career==
===Caliber Comics===

Best known as a writer, Bendis started out as an artist, doing work for local magazines and newspapers, including caricature work. He worked at &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; as an illustrator. Although he did not enjoy caricature work, it paid well and funded his interest in writing crime fiction for graphic novels. He eventually moved into both writing and illustrating his work, before he began producing work for Caliber Comics, including &quot;Spunky Todd&quot;.

Through Caliber, he met many of his longtime friends and collaborators within the comics industry, including Mike Oeming, Dave Mack and Marc Andreyko, and began the first in a series of independent noir fiction crime comics when he published two issues of &quot;Fire&quot; in 1993 and five issues of &quot;A.K.A. Goldfish&quot; in 1994 with Caliber. In 1995 he illustrated &quot;Flaxen&quot; from a script by James Hudnall, with David Mack providing inks to the story featuring former Playboy Playmate Susie Owens as mascot of the Golden Apple Comics chain [of comic shops] in Los Angeles.

Bendis&#x27;s best-known early work, &quot;Jinx&quot;, starring the titular bounty hunter in a crime noir version of the Sergio Leone film &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, began publication in 1996, and ran for seven issues from Caliber.

He characterizes much of this period of his professional life in terms of working as &quot;a graphic artist for almost twelve years&quot;, undergoing a period within that of &quot;nine years&quot; living as a stereotypical &#x27;starving artist&#x27;.

===Image Comics and Oni Comics===
In 1996–1997, Bendis moved from Caliber to Image Comics, where &quot;Jinx&quot; and his other previous crime comics were published by Image&#x27;s Shadowline arm in trade paperback. At Image, he also produced five more issues of &quot;Jinx&quot;.

Impressed with &quot;A.K.A. Goldfish&quot;, Image founder Todd McFarlane sought out Bendis, which led to his writing &quot;Sam and Twitch&quot;. Although set in the Spawn universe, Bendis approached &quot;Sam and Twitch&quot; primarily as a crime comic. He wrote &quot;Sam and Twitch&quot; for twenty issues, as well as most of the first ten issues of &quot;Hellspawn&quot;, another &quot;Spawn&quot; spin-off title. This non-creator-owned work allowed him to, in the words of Rich Kriener in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, &quot;[add] the responsibility of caretaker to his resume, in that he would answer to a vested owner about developing a property as a tangible asset with the future in mind,&quot; rather than only working on his own characters under his own terms.

In 1998, Bendis co-wrote and illustrated the Eliot Ness-starring &quot;Torso&quot; with Marc Andreyko, again for Image, and in 2000 he produced three issues of the autobiographical &quot;Fortune and Glory&quot; for Oni Comics.

That same year saw the debut of the superhero police/noir detective series &quot;Powers&quot;, co-created with and drawn by Michael Avon Oeming and published by Image. &quot;Powers&quot; won major comics industry awards, including Harvey, Eisner, and Eagle Awards.

===Marvel Comics===

Around the time Bendis began &quot;Sam and Twitch&quot;, his friend David Mack began working for Joe Quesada&#x27;s Marvel Knights imprint, which Bendis was a fan of. Based on Bendis&#x27; work on &quot;Jinx&quot;, Quesada invited him to pitch ideas for Marvel Knights, which included a planned, but ultimately unproduced, Nick Fury story.

Marvel Comics President Bill Jemas, on the recommendation of Quesada, hired Bendis to write &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, which debuted in 2000, and was targeted at the new generation of readers. Bendis adapted the 11-page origin story of Spider-Man from 1962&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 into a seven issues story arc, with Peter Parker becoming the titular hero after the fifth issue, making the book a bestseller, often surpassing in sales those of the mainstream Marvel universe title, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. The Bendis/Bagley partnership of 111 consecutive issues made their partnership one of the longest in American comic book history, and the longest run by a Marvel creative team, beating out Stan Lee and Jack Kirby on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Bendis subsequently wrote other books in the Ultimate line, including &quot;Ultimate Marvel Team-Up&quot;, which Bendis pitched to Marvel as a follow-up to &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, as well as &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Origins&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Six&quot;, the first three issues of &quot;Ultimate Power&quot;, and the &quot;Ultimate Comics: Doomsday&quot; metaseries. In 2011, Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created the Miles Morales character as the new version of the Ultimate Spider-Man. Bendis wrote every issue of Ultimate Spider-Man, including its second iteration, &quot;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&quot;.

Quesada offered Bendis the writing duties on &quot;Daredevil&quot;, which he took over in 2001, writing most of the subsequent 55 issues until 2006, collaborating mostly with artist Alex Maleev. As a major Daredevil author, Bendis&#x27;s name is one of the names used for boxers mentioned by a corrupt boxing manager in the 2003 &quot;Daredevil&quot; movie. Also in 2001, Bendis helped launch Marvel&#x27;s non-Comics Code-approved, adult MAX imprint with &quot;Alias&quot;, featuring former superhero Jessica Jones operating as a private investigator. The series ran for 28 issues before many of the characters moved to Bendis&#x27;s mainstream Marvel Universe series &quot;The Pulse&quot;. In 2004 &quot;Powers&quot; moved from Image to Marvel&#x27;s creator-owned imprint Icon, where it was relaunched as &quot;Powers&quot; Vol. 2 alongside another ex-Image series, David Mack&#x27;s &quot;Kabuki&quot;.

Also in 2004, Bendis oversaw the closing issues of &quot;The Avengers&quot; as part of the crossover storyline &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;. This led directly to the Bendis-helmed relaunch of one version of the eponymous team in the pages of &quot;The New Avengers&quot;. Bendis&#x27;s work on this storyline included the death of Avenger Hawkeye, which proved controversial. In 2005, with artist Olivier Coipel, Bendis wrote the New Avengers / X-Men crossover, &quot;House of M&quot;, which would retroactively be considered the second act of a three-act super-event beginning with &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; and culminating in the Bendis-written 2008 storyline &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;. Bendis also wrote the storyline &quot;Secret War&quot;, which was published between 2004 and 2005. The series, which was not connected to the 1984 miniseries &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, served as a prelude to &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;. After Marvel&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Bendis helmed another &quot;Avengers&quot; revival, launching &quot;Mighty Avengers&quot; with Frank Cho in 2007.

Post-&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, Bendis left &quot;Mighty Avengers&quot; with issue #20 and wrote &quot;Secret Invasion: Dark Reign&quot;, a one-shot that preceded another ongoing Avengers series, &quot;Dark Avengers&quot;. In 2009, Bendis and former &quot;Daredevil&quot; collaborator Maleev launched the long-delayed &quot;Spider-Woman&quot;, following up on her role in the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline. &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; was the first comic book to be offered simultaneously on the Internet as a &quot;motion comic&quot; and in comic stores in print form.

Bendis re-teamed with Olivier Coipel for the 2009 crossover series &quot;Siege&quot;, which brought the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline to a close, and with-it, &quot;Dark Avengers&quot;. Springboarding out of &quot;Siege&quot;, Bendis relaunched both &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;New Avengers&quot; as part of the &quot;Heroic Age&quot;.

Also in 2010, Bendis launched &quot;Scarlet&quot; through Icon Comics, his first new creator-owned comic book in over a decade, re-teaming once again with Maleev. In February 2011, Icon released the all-ages graphic novel, &quot;Takio&quot; by Bendis and his &quot;Powers&quot; collaborator Mike Oeming, and in mid-2011 a maxiseries called &quot;Brilliant&quot; with artist Bagley. Bendis&#x27;s other 2011 projects included a new &quot;Moon Knight&quot; series with Maleev, which concluded with issue 12. In 2012, in conjunction with Marvel Studios&#x27; feature film &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Bendis began writing a new &quot;Avengers&quot; comic, &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;. Bendis wrote the first eight issues of &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, a series that premiered in March 2012 that featured a new incarnation of the Zodiac, as well as the return of the Guardians of the Galaxy, which teamed with the Avengers against Thanos.

Bendis concluded his stint on &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;New Avengers&quot; in 2012 with the &quot;End Times&quot; arc. His final issue of &quot;Avengers&quot;, released September 2012, was a &quot;jam issue&quot;, featuring splash pages by Marvel artists including Walt Simonson, Jim Cheung, and Leinil Yu.

Following Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; relaunch of its titles, Bendis took on writing duties on &quot;All New X-Men&quot;, which saw the return of the original 1960s X-Men to the present, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, whose focus shifts to Cyclops&#x27; team of X-Men going rogue after the events of &quot;Avengers Vs. X-Men&quot;, and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, picking up where his &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; run left off.

Bendis wrote the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; crossover storyline, which included an eponymous 10-issue miniseries, that was published between March and June 2013. Issue 10 saw the introduction of the Neil Gaiman character Angela into the Marvel Universe.

On July 22, 2014, Random House published Bendis&#x27;s instruction book on comics, &quot;Words for Pictures: The Art and Business of Writing Comics and Graphic Novels.&quot; The day after that book&#x27;s publication, CBR.com published an interview in which Bendis talked about the course on writing Graphic Novels he had taught for the past few years, initially at Portland State University, and beginning with the Fall 2013 semester, at the University of Oregon. His decision to teach came at the urging of Dark Horse Comics editor Diana Schutz. Among the works he employs as teaching guides are the works of Scott McCloud and Will Eisner.

===DC Comics===

In November 2017, Bendis announced via Twitter that he would be working exclusively with DC Comics. His DC debut was in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1000 (June 2018). Ivan Reis drew the first issue of Bendis&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; limited series, and collaborated with Bendis on the relaunched the ongoing &quot;Superman&quot; series in 2018. Bendis took over writing &quot;Action Comics&quot; following its 1,000th issue.

On December 21, 2021, Bendis announced that he was developing an adult animated &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; series for the streaming service HBO Max. The show is set to be based on his run of the comic book series and will not connect to the original animated series.

==Work in other media==
In addition to his primary work in comics, Bendis has produced written work in several other media, such as video games, TV and film.

Bendis was the co-executive producer and series-pilot writer for Mainframe Entertainment&#x27;s 2003 animated &quot;Spider-Man&quot; show, &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot; that aired on MTV and YTV, which features a college-aged Peter Parker, and was written to tie-into the then-unreleased 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. The pilot episode that Bendis wrote became the third episode aired. His dismay at being credited for something written by someone else, and the multitude of corporate and legal departments involved in the animation process soured him on the show.

Bendis was one of the writers on the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; animated series, which debuted in 2012.

He was credited as a developer and wrote several episodes for the TV adaptation of his comic, &quot;Powers&quot;, which starred Sharlto Copley and ran on PlayStation Network for two seasons from 2015 to 2016.

Bendis&#x27;s video game work includes Activision&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; video game, which Bendis wrote. He also wrote an &quot;Avengers&quot; game, which was never released. He was also a writer of Marvel&#x27;s MMO, &quot;Marvel Heroes&quot;.

His film work includes the screenplay adaptation of &quot;A.K.A. Goldfish&quot; for Miramax, and the screenplay adaptation of &quot;Jinx&quot; for Universal Pictures. In 2014, he wrote the plot of the &quot;Disney Infinity 2.0&quot; video game.

In 2013, he was named on IGN&#x27;s list of &quot;The Best Tweeters in Comics&quot;, in part for his frequent Twitter posts highlighting the work of other creators.

==Writing style==

When creating characters, Bendis says that he always begins with someone he knows and builds upon that inspiration, allowing the character to eventually evolve naturally. His depiction of Aunt May in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, for example, strongly resembles his mother.

==Personal life==
Bendis met his wife Alisa in 1995 through the Cleveland chapter of the Hillel Foundation, where Alisa worked and Bendis was a staff illustrator. The two were married within a year. Alisa Bendis manages JINXWORLD, the company through which Bendis produces his creator-owned and licensed comics work. They have four children, of which three are daughters. Bendis&#x27;s oldest daughter, Olivia, is his biological daughter. He and his wife adopted their two younger daughters, one of whom is African-American, and the other of whom is Ethiopian. Their names are Tabatha (adopted in June 2011) and Sabrina. Bendis mentioned in a July 2013 post on his Tumblr account that they had a newborn son, who is named London.

<doc id="633319" wikidata="Q1008555" url="?curid=633319" title="Gault Millau">
<text>Gault et Millau () is a French restaurant guide. It was founded by two restaurant critics, Henri Gault and Christian Millau in 1965.

==Points system==
Gault Millau rates restaurants on a scale of 1 to 20, with 20 being the highest. Restaurants given below 10 points are rarely listed. The points are awarded based on the quality of the food, with comments about service, price or the atmosphere of the restaurant given separately. Based on this rating, high-ranking restaurants may display one to five toques. Gault Millau does not accept payment for listing restaurants.

Under its original authors and for many years after they left, Gault Millau never awarded a score of 20 points, under the argument that perfection is beyond the limitations of a normal human being. In 2004, two restaurants, both of chef Marc Veyrat, the Maison de Marc Veyrat (or L&#x27;Auberge de l&#x27;Eridan) in Veyrier-du-Lac near Annecy and La Ferme de Mon Père (&quot;My Father&#x27;s Farm&quot;) in Megève, received this score. In 2010 and 2011, Sergio Herman&#x27;s Oud Sluis also received a score of 20/20. To some, this reflects a fall of standards in the guide after it changed from employing a permanent editorial and tasting staff to using local agents.

==Differences with Michelin==
There has been discussion about which guide is more important, the Michelin Guide or the Gault Millau. In the 1970s the Michelin&#x27;s continued conservative support of traditional haute cuisine was challenged by the support of nouvelle cuisine by the Gault-Millau. Michelin is more popular and therefore more influential, while Gault Millau has been considered more food-focused due to the main system being based purely on the quality of the food. Gault Millau has guides for various other countries, including Netherlands, Belgium &amp; Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Poland.

Roughly speaking 1* restaurants have an average score of 15,5. 2* restaurants have an average of 17,5 and 3* restaurants have an average score of 18,75 (the majority of Gault-Millau scored restaurants actually don&#x27;t have any Michelin stars). However Michelin and Gault-Millau scores don&#x27;t always show much agreement, 1* restaurants can score as low as 12 and as high as 18 on the Gault-Millau rating.

<doc id="633325" wikidata="Q1801478" url="?curid=633325" title="Neutrino astronomy">
<text>Neutrino astronomy is the branch of astronomy that gathers information about astronomical objects by observing and studying neutrinos emitted by them with the help of neutrino detectors in special Earth observatories. It is an emerging field in astroparticle physics providing insights into the high-energy and non-thermal processes in the universe. 

Neutrinos are nearly massless and electrically neutral or chargeless elementary particles. They are created as a result of certain types of radioactive decay, nuclear reactions such as those that take place in the Sun or high energy astrophysical phenomena, in nuclear reactors, or when cosmic rays hit atoms in the atmosphere. Neutrinos rarely interact with matter (only via the weak nuclear force), travel at nearly the speed of light in straight lines, pass through large amounts of matter without any notable absorption or without being deflected by magnetic fields. Unlike photons, neutrinos rarely scatter along their trajectory. But like photons, neutrinos are some of the most common particles in the universe. Because of this, neutrinos offer a unique opportunity to observe processes that are inaccessible to optical telescopes, such as reactions in the Sun&#x27;s core. Neutrinos that are created in the Sun’s core are barely absorbed, so a large quantity of them escape from the Sun and reach the Earth. Neutrinos can also offer a very strong pointing direction compared to charged particle cosmic rays.

Neutrinos are very hard to detect due to their non-interactive nature. In order to detect neutrinos, scientists have to shield the detectors from cosmic rays, which can penetrate hundreds of meters of rock. Neutrinos, on the other hand, can go through the entire planet without being absorbed, like &quot;ghost particles&quot;. That&#x27;s why neutrino detectors are placed many hundreds of meter underground, usually at the bottom of mines. There a neutrino detection liquid such as a Chlorine-rich solution is placed; the neutrinos react with a Chlorine isotope and can create radioactive Argon. Gallium to Germanium conversion has also been used. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory built in 2010 in the south pole is the biggest neutrino detector, consisting of thousands of optical sensors buried 500 meters underneath a cubic kilometer of deep, ultra-transparent ice, detects light emitted by charged particles that are produced when a single neutrino collides with a proton or neutron inside an atom. The resulting nuclear reaction produces secondary particles traveling at high speeds that give off a blue light called Cherenkov radiation. Super-Kamiokande in Japan and ANTARES and KM3NeT in the Mediterranean are some other important neutrino detectors.

Since neutrinos interact weakly, neutrino detectors must have large target masses (often thousands of tons). The detectors also must use shielding and effective software to remove background signal. Since neutrinos are very difficult to detect, the only bodies that have been studied in this way are the sun and the supernova SN1987A, which exploded in 1987. Scientist predicted that supernova explosions would produce bursts of neutrinos, and a similar burst was actually detected from Supernova 1987A.

In the future neutrino astronomy promises to discover other aspects of the universe, including coincidental gravitational waves, gamma ray bursts, the cosmic neutrino background, origins of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, neutrino properties (such as neutrino mass hierarchy), dark matter properties, etc. It will become an integral part of multi-messenger astronomy, complementing gravitational astronomy and traditional telescopic astronomy.

==History==
Neutrinos were first recorded in 1956 by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in an experiment employing a nearby nuclear reactor as a neutrino source. Their discovery was acknowledged with a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.

This was followed by the first atmospheric neutrino detection in 1965 by two groups almost simultaneously. One was led by Frederick Reines who operated a liquid scintillator - the Case-Witwatersrand-Irvine or CWI detector - in the East Rand gold mine in South Africa at an 8.8 km water depth equivalent. The other was a Bombay-Osaka-Durham collaboration that operated in the Indian Kolar Gold Field mine at an equivalent water depth of 7.5 km. Although the KGF group detected neutrino candidates two months later than Reines CWI, they were given formal priority due to publishing their findings two weeks earlier.

In 1968, Raymond Davis, Jr. and John N. Bahcall successfully detected the first solar neutrinos in the Homestake experiment. Davis, along with Japanese physicist Masatoshi Koshiba were jointly awarded half of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos (the other half went to Riccardo Giacconi for corresponding pioneering contributions which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources).&quot;

The first generation of undersea neutrino telescope projects began with the proposal by Moisey Markov in 1960 &quot;...to install detectors deep in a lake or a sea and to determine the location of charged particles with the help of Cherenkov radiation.&quot;

The first underwater neutrino telescope began as the DUMAND project. DUMAND stands for Deep Underwater Muon and Neutrino Detector. The project began in 1976 and although it was eventually cancelled in 1995, it acted as a precursor to many of the following telescopes in the following decades.

The Baikal Neutrino Telescope is installed in the southern part of Lake Baikal in Russia. The detector is located at a depth of 1.1 km and began surveys in 1980. In 1993, it was the first to deploy three strings to reconstruct the muon trajectories as well as the first to record atmospheric neutrinos underwater.

AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array) used the 3 km thick ice layer at the South Pole and was located several hundred meters from the Amundsen-Scott station. Holes 60 cm in diameter were drilled with pressurized hot water in which strings with optical modules were deployed before the water refroze. The depth proved to be insufficient to be able to reconstruct the trajectory due to the scattering of light on air bubbles. A second group of 4 strings were added in 1995/96 to a depth of about 2000 m that was sufficient for track reconstruction. The AMANDA array was subsequently upgraded until January 2000 when it consisted of 19 strings with a total of 667 optical modules at a depth range between 1500 m and 2000 m. AMANDA would eventually be the predecessor to IceCube in 2005.

An example of an early neutrino detector is the (ASD), located in the Soledar Salt Mine in Ukraine at a depth of more than 100 m. It was created in the Department of High Energy Leptons and Neutrino Astrophysics of the Institute of Nuclear Research of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1969 to study antineutrino fluxes from collapsing stars in the Galaxy, as well as the spectrum and interactions of muons of cosmic rays with energies up to 10 ^ 13 eV. A feature of the detector is a 100-ton scintillation tank with dimensions on the order of the length of an electromagnetic shower with an initial energy of 100 GeV.

===21st century===
After the decline of DUMAND the participating groups split into three branches to explore deep sea options in the Mediterranean Sea. ANTARES was anchored to the sea floor in the region off Toulon at the French Mediterranean coast. It consists of 12 strings, each carrying 25 &quot;storeys&quot; equipped with three optical modules, an electronic container, and calibration devices down to a maximum depth of 2475 m.

NEMO (NEutrino Mediterranean Observatory) was pursued by Italian groups to investigate the feasibility of a cubic-kilometer scale deep-sea detector. A suitable site at a depth of 3.5 km about 100 km off Capo Passero at the South-Eastern coast of Sicily has been identified. From 2007 to 2011 the first prototyping phase tested a &quot;mini-tower&quot; with 4 bars deployed for several weeks near Catania at a depth of 2 km. The second phase as well as plans to deploy the full-size prototype tower will be pursued in the KM3NeT framework.

The NESTOR Project was installed in 2004 to a depth of 4 km and operated for one month until a failure of the cable to shore forced it to be terminated. The data taken still successfully demonstrated the detector&#x27;s functionality and provided a measurement of the atmospheric muon flux. The proof of concept will be implemented in the KM3Net framework.

The second generation of deep-sea neutrino telescope projects reach or even exceed the size originally conceived by the DUMAND pioneers. IceCube, located at the South Pole and incorporating its predecessor AMANDA, was completed in December 2010. It currently consists of 5160 digital optical modules installed on 86 strings at depths of 1450 to 2550 m in the Antarctic ice. The KM3NeT in the Mediterranean Sea and the GVD are in their preparatory/prototyping phase. IceCube instruments 1 km3 of ice. GVD is also planned to cover 1 km3 but at a much higher energy threshold. KM3NeT is planned to cover several km3 and have two components; ARCA (&quot;Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss&quot;) and ORCA (&quot;Oscillations Research with Cosmics in the Abyss&quot;). Both KM3NeT and GVD have completed at least part of their construction and it is expected that these two along with IceCube will form a global neutrino observatory.

In July 2018, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory announced that they have traced an extremely-high-energy neutrino that hit their Antarctica-based research station in September 2017 back to its point of origin in the blazar TXS 0506+056 located 3.7 billion light-years away in the direction of the constellation Orion. This is the first time that a neutrino detector has been used to locate an object in space and that a source of cosmic rays has been identified.

In November 2022, the IceCube collaboration made another significant progress towards identifying the origin of cosmic rays, reporting the observation of 79 neutrinos with an energy over 1 TeV originated from the nearby galaxy M77. These findings in a well-known object are expected to help study the active nucleus of this galaxy, as well as serving as a baseline for future observations.

In June 2023, astronomers reported using a new technique to detect, for the first time, the release of neutrinos from the galactic plane of the Milky Way galaxy.

==Detection methods==

Neutrinos interact incredibly rarely with matter, so the vast majority of neutrinos will pass through a detector without interacting. If a neutrino does interact, it will only do so once. Therefore, to perform neutrino astronomy, large detectors must be used to obtain enough statistics.

The method of neutrino detection depends on the energy and type of the neutrino. A famous example is that anti-electron neutrinos can interact with a nucleus in the detector by inverse beta decay and produce a positron and a neutron. The positron immediately will annihilate with an electron, producing two 511keV photons. The neutron will attach to another nucleus and give off a gamma with an energy of a few MeV. In general, neutrinos can interact through neutral-current and charged-current interactions. In neutral-current interactions, the neutrino interacts with a nucleus or electron and the neutrino retains its original flavor. In charged-current interactions, the neutrino is absorbed by the nucleus and produces a lepton corresponding to the neutrino&#x27;s flavor (&lt;chem&gt;\nu_{e} -&gt; e^-&lt;/chem&gt;,&lt;chem&gt;\nu_{\mu} -&gt; \mu^{-}&lt;/chem&gt;, etc.). If the charged resultants are moving fast enough, they can create Cherenkov light.

To observe neutrino interactions, detectors use photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect individual photons. From the timing of the photons, it is possible to determine the time and place of the neutrino interaction. If the neutrino creates a muon during its interaction, then the muon will travel in a line, creating a &quot;track&quot; of Cherenkov photons. The data from this track can be used to reconstruct the directionality of the muon. For high-energy interactions, the neutrino and muon directions are the same, so it&#x27;s possible to tell where the neutrino came from. This is pointing direction is important in extra-solar system neutrino astronomy. Along with time, position, and possibly direction, it&#x27;s possible to infer the energy of the neutrino from the interactions. The number of photons emitted is related to the neutrino energy, and neutrino energy is important for measuring the fluxes from solar and geo-neutrinos.

Due to the rareness of neutrino interactions, it is important to maintain a low background signal. For this reason, most neutrino detectors are constructed under a rock or water overburden. This overburden shields against most cosmic rays in the atmosphere; only some of the highest-energy muons are able to penetrate to the depths of our detectors. Detectors must include ways of dealing with data from muons so as to not confuse them with neutrinos. Along with more complicated measures, if a muon track is first detected outside of the desired &quot;fiducial&quot; volume, the event is treated as a muon and not considered. Ignoring events outside the fiducial volume also decreases the signal from radiation outside the detector.

Despite shielding efforts, it is inevitable that some background will make it into the detector, many times in the form of radioactive impurities within the detector itself. At this point, if it is impossible to differentiate between the background and true signal, a Monte Carlo simulation must be used to model the background. While it may be unknown if an individual event is background or signal, it is possible to detect an excess about the background, signifying existence of the desired signal.

==Applications==
When astronomical bodies, such as the Sun, are studied using light, only the surface of the object can be directly observed. Any light produced in the core of a star will interact with gas particles in the outer layers of the star, taking hundreds of thousands of years to make it to the surface, making it impossible to observe the core directly. Since neutrinos are also created in the cores of stars (as a result of stellar fusion), the core can be observed using neutrino astronomy. Other sources of neutrinos- such as neutrinos released by supernovae- have been detected. Several neutrino experiments have formed the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS), where they search for an increase of neutrino flux that could signal a supernova event.
There are currently goals to detect neutrinos from other sources, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN), as well as gamma-ray bursts and starburst galaxies. Neutrino astronomy may also indirectly detect dark matter.

=== Supernova warning ===
Seven neutrino experiments (Super-K, LVD, IceCube, KamLAND, Borexino, Daya Bay, and HALO) work together as the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS). In a core collapse supernova, ninety-nine percent of the energy released will be in neutrinos. While photons can be trapped in the dense supernova for hours, neutrinos are able to escape on the order of seconds. Since neutrinos travel at roughly the speed of light, they can reach Earth before photons do. If two or more of SNEWS detectors observe a coincidence of an increased flux of neutrinos, an alert is sent to professional and amateur astronomers to be on the lookout for supernova light. By using the distance between detectors and the time difference between detections, the alert can also include directionality as to the supernova&#x27;s location in the sky.

=== Stellar processes ===

The Sun, like other stars, is powered by nuclear fusion in its core. The core is incredibly large, meaning that photons produced in the core will take a long time to diffuse outward. Therefore, neutrinos are the only way that we can obtain real-time data about the nuclear processes in the Sun.

There are two main processes for stellar nuclear fusion. The first is the Proton-Proton (PP) chain, in which protons are fused together into helium, sometimes temporarily creating the heavier elements of lithium, beryllium, and boron along the way. The second is the CNO cycle, in which carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are fused with protons, and then undergo alpha decay (helium nucleus emission) to begin the cycle again. The PP chain is the primary process in the Sun, while the CNO cycle is more dominant in stars more massive than the Sun.

Each step in the process has an allowed spectra of energy for the neutrino (or a discrete energy for electron capture processes). The relative rates of the Sun&#x27;s nuclear processes can be determined by observations in its flux at different energies. This would shed insight into the Sun&#x27;s properties, such as metallicity, which is the composition of heavier elements.

Borexino is one of the detectors studying solar neutrinos. In 2018, they found 5σ significance for the existence of neutrinos from the fusing of two protons with an electron (pep neutrinos). In 2020, they found for the first time evidence of CNO neutrinos in the Sun. Improvements on the CNO measurement will be especially helpful in determining the Sun&#x27;s metallicity.

=== Composition and structure of Earth ===
The interior of Earth contains radioactive elements such as &lt;chem&gt;^{40}K&lt;/chem&gt; and the decay chains of &lt;chem&gt;^{238}U&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;^{232}Th&lt;/chem&gt;. These elements decay via Beta decay, which emits an anti-neutrino. The energies of these anti-neutrinos are dependent on the parent nucleus. Therefore, by detecting the anti-neutrino flux as a function of energy, we can obtain the relative compositions of these elements and set a limit on the total power output of Earth&#x27;s geo-reactor. Most of our current data about the core and mantle of Earth comes from seismic data, which does not provide any information as to the nuclear composition of these layers.

Borexino has detected these geo-neutrinos through the process &lt;chem&gt;\bar{\nu}+p^+\longrightarrow e^+ {+n}&lt;/chem&gt;. The resulting positron will immediately annihilate with an electron and produce two gamma-rays each with an energy of 511keV (the rest mass of an electron). The neutron will later be captured by another nucleus, which will lead to a 2.22MeV gamma-ray as the nucleus de-excites. This process on average takes on the order of 256 microseconds. By searching for time and spatial coincidence of these gamma rays, the experimenters can be certain there was an event.

Using over 3,200 days of data, Borexino used geoneutrinos to place constraints on the composition and power output of the mantle. They found that the ratio of &lt;chem&gt;^{238}U&lt;/chem&gt; to &lt;chem&gt;^{232}Th&lt;/chem&gt; is the same as chondritic meteorites. The power output from uranium and thorium in Earth&#x27;s mantle was found to be 14.2-35.7 TW with a 68% confidence interval.

Neutrino tomography also provides insight into the interior of Earth. For neutrinos with energies of a few TeV, the interaction probability becomes non-negligible when passing through Earth. The interaction probability will depend on the number of nucleons the neutrino passed along its path, which is directly related to density. If the initial flux is known (as it is in the case of atmospheric neutrinos), then detecting the final flux provides information about the interactions that occurred. The density can then be extrapolated from knowledge of these interactions. This can provide an independent check on the information obtained from seismic data.

In 2018, one year worth of IceCube data was evaluated to perform neutrino tomography. The analysis studied upward going muons, which provide both the energy and directionality of the neutrinos after passing through the Earth. A model of Earth with five layers of constant density was fit to the data, and the resulting density agreed with seismic data. The values determined for the total mass of Earth, the mass of the core, and the moment of inertia all agree with the data obtained from seismic and gravitational data. With the current data, the uncertainties on these values are still large, but future data from IceCube and KM3NeT will place tighter restrictions on this data.

=== High-energy astrophysical events ===
Neutrinos can either be primary cosmic rays (astrophysical neutrinos), or be produced from cosmic ray interactions. In the latter case, the primary cosmic ray will produce pions and kaons in the atmosphere. As these hadrons decay, they produce neutrinos (called atmospheric neutrinos). At low energies, the flux of atmospheric neutrinos is many times greater than astrophysical neutrinos. At high energies, the pions and kaons have a longer lifetime (due to relativistic time dilation). The hadrons are now more likely to interact before they decay. Because of this, the astrophysical neutrino flux will dominate at high energies (~100TeV). To perform neutrino astronomy of high-energy objects, experiments rely on the highest energy neutrinos.

To perform astronomy of distant objects, a strong angular resolution is required. Neutrinos are electrically neutral and interact weakly, so they travel mostly unperturbed in straight lines. If the neutrino interacts within a detector and produces a muon, the muon will produce an observable track. At high energies, the neutrino direction and muon direction are closely correlated, so it is possible to trace back the direction of the incoming neutrino.

These high-energy neutrinos are either the primary or secondary cosmic rays produced by energetic astrophysical processes. Observing neutrinos could provide insights into these processes beyond what is observable with electromagnetic radiation. In the case of the neutrino detected from a distant blazar, multi-wavelength astronomy was used to show spatial coincidence, confirming the blazar as the source. In the future, neutrinos could be used to supplement electromagnetic and gravitational observations, leading to multi-messenger astronomy.

<text>Steven Kapur (born 11 May 1967), known by the stage name Apache Indian, is a British singer-songwriter and reggae DJ. He had a series of hits during the 1990s. He is best known in the UK for the song &quot;Boom Shack-A-Lak&quot;, which reached the top ten during August 1993.

==Biography and career==
Born into a family of Indian origins, Kapur was raised in Handsworth, Birmingham, UK, a racially mixed area with large Black and Asian communities, home of reggae bands such as Steel Pulse, and by the early 1980s he was working with local sound systems and grew dreadlocks. By the mid-1980s he had trimmed his hair and began to make a name for himself as a dancehall deejay. Apache recorded his first single in 1990, &quot;Movie Over India&quot;, initially a white-label pressing, until it was picked up by the reggae distributor Jet Star. The single mixed ragga and bhangra sounds and was hugely popular among audiences of both genres. Two further singles followed in a similar vein, &quot;Chok There&quot; and &quot;Don Raja&quot;, bringing him to the attention of the major labels, and in 1992 he signed a recording contract with Island Records.

With the collaboration of his cousins Simon &amp; Diamond, he introduced the new hybrid sound of bhangra raggamuffin – also known as bhangramuffin – to the world with his first album &quot;No Reservations&quot;, recorded in Jamaica and produced by Simon &amp; Diamond, Phil Chill, Robert Livingston, Bobby Digital and Sly Dunbar in 1993. It was followed by &quot;Make Way for the Indian&quot; (produced by Sly &amp; Robbie, The Press, Mafia &amp; Fluxy, Pandit Dineysh and Chris Lane), which featured rapper Tim Dog and spawned the hit &quot;Boom Shack-A-Lak&quot;. By 1997 he parted ways with Island and his next album, &quot;Real People&quot; (produced by Harjinder Boparai) was signed and released by Warner Bros. Sweden and proved to be his most experimental album, and also featured more Indian elements than the other albums. By 2000, Apache had parted ways with Warner; he later signed to US management company Sunset Entertainment Group, which would lead later on in 2013 for Apache to collaborate on an album with hit producers Jim Beanz &amp; Charlie Hype (both also signed to Sunset Entertainment Group).

Lyrically, Apache Indian usually sings in Jamaican Patois. He has written songs about serious topics, such as &quot;Arranged Marriage&quot;, &quot;Aids Warning&quot;, and &quot;Election Crisis&quot;. as well as lighter songs such as &quot;Boom Shack-A-Lak&quot;, &quot;Jump Up&quot;, &quot;Girls Dem Fiyah&quot;, and &quot;Celebrate&quot;.

Apache Indian has recorded with Wreckx &#x27;n&#x27; Effect, the United States chart topper Sean Paul, Maxi Priest, General Levy, Brian and Tony Gold, Frankie Paul, Shaggy, Yami Bolo, Boy George, A. R. Rahman, Bappi Lahiri, Sameera Singh, Asha Bhosle and Pras of the Fugees, Malkit Singh, and with Jazzy B on the album &quot;Dil Luteya&quot;, StereoNation, Sasi the Don, Bally Sagoo, Raghav, and Jim Beanz. He also was a playback singer for the soundtrack of Iddarammayilatho.

&quot;Boom Shack-A-Lak&quot; is featured in several Hollywood movies, including &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; and &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot;. It is also featured on the soundtrack for &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, along with artists such as Fatboy Slim, The B-52&#x27;s, 2 Unlimited and New Radicals and the movie &quot;Threesome&quot;.

In 2018, he co-hosted the Brit Asia TV Music Awards with Preeya Kalidas.

His single &quot;Om Namaha Shivaya&quot; is on the Putumayo World Music compilation album, &quot;World Reggae&quot; which is a collection of reggae tracks performed by artists from around the world.

Apache Indian was nominated for a Ivor Novello Award for best contemporary song for &quot;Arranged Marriage&quot;, and nominated for a Mercury Music Prize for his debut album &quot;No Reservations&quot; in 1993. Apache Indian was also nominated for the Central Britain Media and Arts Asian Jewel Award in 2004. Apache was presented an award at the Asian Media Awards in Manchester UK for his talk show &quot;Real Talk&quot; (featured on Brit Asia TV) in 2013 and in 2014 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award also at the Asian Media Awards. In late 2014, Apache received a lifetime achievement award from Brit Asia TV.

Apache Indian did a limited release of his album &quot;It Is What It Is&quot; in late 2013 on Universal India. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Celebrate&quot; was a collaboration with Canadian pop singer Raghav and producer Jim Beanz. The album was written and recorded in Philadelphia at the Sunset Entertainment Group headquarters, featuring production from Jim Beanz, Charlie Hype, TroyBoi and J.Nick.

He was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to music and young people and performed at the closing ceremony for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in his hometown of Birmingham.

==Apache Indian Music Academy==
In November 2013, Apache Indian opened the Apache Indian Music Academy at South and City College, in his hometown of Handsworth.

<text>John Stephen Parrott (born 11 May 1964) is an English former professional snooker player who won the 1991 World Snooker Championship. He was a professional during the late 1980s and 1990s, and remained within the top 16 of the world rankings for 14 consecutive seasons. Following his playing career, he is also a snooker commentator and pundit.

He twice reached the final of the World Snooker Championship. At the 1989 World Snooker Championship, he lost 3–18 to Steve Davis, the heaviest defeat in a world championship final in modern times. Two years later, however, he defeated Jimmy White in the final of the 1991 event. He also won against White later the same year, to win the 1991 UK Championship title. This made him only the third player to win both championships in the same calendar year (after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry); he is one of only six players to have achieved this feat. The following year, Parrott lost in the final of the 1992 UK Championship, again to White. Parrott reached the final of the Masters on three occasions, losing to Hendry each time.

Parrott reached his highest place in the world rankings in 1989–90, 1992–93, 1993–94 where he was second. He is one of several players to have achieved more than 200 competitive century break during his career, with 221. Following his playing career, Parrott became a commentator and pundit for the BBC. In addition, he also presented horse racing and was a regular on BBC quiz show A Question of Sport.

==Early life and career==

John Parrott was born on 11 May 1964 at the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital, Liverpool. Parrott grew up with his aunt and uncle following a split between his parents when he was 4. He was a keen bowls player until the age of 11, as he was first introduced to snooker by his father. He lost in the final of the English Under-16s Championship in 1979 and then again in 1980. The next year, he won the 1981 Pontins Junior Championship. In 1982, he won the Pontins Open, a tournament with over 1,000 entrants. The same year, he also won the televised Junior Pot Black championship. He turned professional in 1983 after winning 14 tournaments in his last year as an amateur player, including a second Junior Pot Black title, and finishing as runner-up in the English Amateur Championship.

==Professional career==

Parrott turned professional in 1983, aged 19, making his televised debut as a professional during the last 16 of the 1984 Classic. In the match, he defeated Alex Higgins 5–2. He then beat Tony Knowles in the next round before losing to Steve Davis in the semi-finals on a . Parrott qualified for the World Snooker Championship on the first attempt, losing only three frames in qualification. He defeated Knowles, but lost in the quarter-finals to Dennis Taylor. He finished his first professional season ranked 20th in the world. In 1987, Parrott was placed within the top 16 in the world for the first time.

At the 1988 Classic, Parrott reached his first ranking event final. Despite leading 1110, he lost 1113 to Steve Davis. The following season, Parrott was runner-up in four events. He lost again to Davis in the final of the 1988 World Matchplay, to Stephen Hendry in the final of the invitational 1989 Masters, to Mike Hallett at the 1989 English Professional Championship.

He also reached the final to play Davis at the 1989 World Snooker Championship. In the first to 18 match, Parrott trailed 25, but won only one more frame in the match, losing 318. The loss was the largest in any World Championship final. With the match finishing early, Parrott had to play an exhibition match in place of the final session. Parrott finished the season at his highest world ranking, second to Davis.

Parrott won his first ranking title at the 1989 European Open, defeating Terry Griffiths in the final 98. He successfully defended his title at the 1990 event, defeating Stephen Hendry 106 in the final. Parrott reached the final of the 1990 Masters for a second time, losing again to Hendry. He finished the season at the 1990 World Snooker Championship losing in the semi-final 1116 to Hendry.

Parrott reached the final of the World Championship again in 1991. Defeating Nigel Gilbert, Tony Knowles, Griffiths and Davis, he played Jimmy White in the final. He took a 70 lead, winning the match 1811. Following the World Championship win, Parrott won both the 1991 Dubai Classic over Knowles and his second Triple Crown event - the 1991 UK Championship. He once again played White in the final, defeating him 1613. He was just the third person to win hold both the UK and World Championships sequentially. Parrott finished the 1991–92 season once again to World Number two.

In 1992, Parrott reached four major finals. He retained the Dubai Classic, defeating Hendry on a , but lost both the UK Championship and Masters to White and Hendry, respectively. This was the last time Parrott reached the final of the Masters. Having won both the UK Championship, he was unable to complete the Triple Crown. Parrott also reached the final of the 1992 Strachan Open losing to James Wattana.He finished the season again in second in the world rankings for the third and final time.

The following season, Parrott won the 1994 International Open, defeating Wattana in the final. Later in 1994, he reached the final of the European Open for the third time, this time losing to Hendry. Parrott would, however, win the European Open the following season with a victory in the final over Peter Ebdon. The same season, Parrott won the 1995 Thailand Classic for the third time, defeating Nigel Bond in the final.

Over the next two seasons, Parrott reached the final of three more rankings events. He lost the 1997 European Open, 1997 German Open finals both to John Higgins and 1998 Thailand Masters to Hendry. This was the last ranking event final of Parrotts career. He spent 14 consecutive seasons in the top 16 of the snooker world rankings, from 1987 until 2001, 11 of which were in the top 6. He captained the England team that won the 2000 Nations Cup.

At the 2007 World Snooker Championship he reached the last 16 of the World Championship for the first time since 2000, after victories over James Leadbetter, David Gray and Steve Davis (10–9, having led 6–1 and 9–6). He was also the first player to conduct a &quot;whitewash&quot; in the Crucible World Championship final stages, when he defeated Eddie Charlton 10–0 in the first round of the 1992 tournament. For 27 years, he held the record for being the only player ever to achieve this, until Shaun Murphy defeated China&#x27;s Luo Honghao 10–0 in the first round of the 2019 World Championship.

Following his 6–10 defeat to young Chinese player Zhang Anda in the 2010 World Championship Qualifiers, Parrott finished outside the top 64 in the end of season rankings and was not assured a place on the main tour for the 2010–11 season. Later Parrott announced he was to retire from the professional game.

Parrott played in the 2011 World Seniors Championship, where he lost in the semi-finals to Davis.
He also participated in the preliminary qualifying rounds of the 2012 World Snooker Championship losing 0–5 to Patrick Wallace in Round 1.

Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan wrote that he considered Parrott to be a &quot;great match player [with] plenty of bottle&quot; that, before the emergence of the &quot;Class of &#x27;92 (snooker)&quot;, was the only player that would go &quot;toe to toe&quot; with Hendry. In their 2005 book &quot;Masters of the Baize&quot;, Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby described Parrott as a &quot;solid and belligerent player, with a delightfully smooth cue action&quot;. Robert Philip of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote approvingly in 2007 of how Parrott had prioritised his family above playing, and speculated that had he not done so, Parrott could have won further world championships.

==Television==
Following his playing career, Parrott became a pundit and commentator on snooker for BBC Sport. From 1996 to 2002, he was one of the team captains on the BBC quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, alongside association football player Ally McCoist. As a supporter of horse racing, he was involved in the BBC&#x27;s horse racing coverage as part of the presenting team.

==Personal life==
In 1996, Parrott was honoured with an MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list, for charitable services in Merseyside. In 2008, he launched John Parrott Cue Sports, an online retailer selling snooker and pool cues and some snooker collectables. This was re-branded John Parrott Sports in 2019. Parrott is a supporter of Everton F.C. and brother-in-law of former Everton player Duncan Ferguson. Parrott was made the Honorary Patron of the British Crown Green Bowling Association in 2010.

<text>The Triumph of Death is an oil panel painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder painted c. 1562. It has been in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1827.

==Description==
The painting shows a panorama of an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks.

A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation. Fish lie rotting on the shores of a corpse-choked pond. Art historian James Snyder emphasizes the &quot;scorched, barren earth, devoid of any life as far as the eye can see.&quot;

In this setting, legions of skeletons advance on the living, who either flee in terror or try in vain to fight back. In the foreground, skeletons haul a wagon full of skulls. In the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the death knell of the world. People are herded into a coffin-shaped trap decorated with crosses, while skeletons on horseback kill people with a scythe. This is one of four horses ridden by skeletons that are depicted in the painting, probably alluding to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds – from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal – being taken by death indiscriminately.

A skeleton parodies human happiness by playing a hurdy-gurdy, while the wheels of his cart crush a man as if his life is of no importance. A woman has fallen in the path of the death cart. She has a slender thread which is about to be cut by the scissors in her other hand—Bruegel&#x27;s interpretation of Atropos. Nearby, another woman in the path of the cart holds in her hand a spindle and distaff, classical symbols of the fragility of human life—another Bruegel interpretation of Clotho and Lachesis.

A starving dog nibbles at the face of a dead child lying still within its dead mother&#x27;s embrace. Just beside her, a cardinal is helped towards his fate by a skeleton who mockingly wears the red hat, while a dying king&#x27;s barrels of gold and silver coins are looted by yet another skeleton, oblivious to the fact that a skeleton is warning him with an empty hourglass that his life is about to literally run out of time. The foolish and miserly monarch&#x27;s last thoughts still compel him to reach out for his useless and vain wealth, seeming unaware of the need for repentance. In the centre, an awakening religious pilgrim has his throat cut by a robber-skeleton for his money purse. Above the murder, skeleton-fishermen catch people in a net.

In the bottom right-hand corner, a dinner has been broken up and the diners are putting up a futile resistance. They have drawn their swords in order to fight the skeletons dressed in winding-sheets. No less hopelessly, the court jester takes refuge beneath the dinner table. The backgammon board and the playing cards have been scattered, while a skeleton thinly disguised with a mask (possibly the face of a corpse) empties away the wine flasks. Of the menu of the interrupted meal, all that can be seen are a few pallid rolls of bread and an appetiser apparently consisting of a pared human skull. Above the table are two women. The one on the left struggles in vain while being embraced by a skeleton, in a hideous parody of after-dinner amorousness. The woman on the right is horrified with the realisation of mortality when a skeleton in a hooded robe mockingly seems to bring another dish, also consisting of human bones, to the table.

In the bottom right-hand corner, a musician plays a lute while his lady sings. Both are oblivious to the fact that, behind both of them, the skeleton that plays along is grimly aware that the couple can not escape their inevitable doom. A cross sits in the centre of the painting. The painting shows aspects of everyday life in the mid-sixteenth century, when the risk of plague was very severe. Clothes are clearly depicted, as are pastimes such as playing cards and backgammon. It shows objects such as musical instruments, an early mechanical clock, scenes including a funeral service, and various methods of execution, including the breaking wheel, the gallows, burning at the stake, and the headsman about to behead a victim who has just taken wine and communion. In one scene, a human is the prey of a skeleton-hunter and his dogs.

In another scene at the left, skeletons drag victims down to be drowned in a pond. A man with a grinding stone around his neck is about to be thrown into the pond by the skeletons—an echoing of Matthew 18.6 and Luke 17.2. On the bridge just above at the right, a skeleton is about to strike a prostrate victim with a falchion.

Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These represent both the native tradition of Northern woodcuts of the Dance of Death, and the Italian conception of the &quot;Triumph of Death&quot;. Classic examples of his frescoes can now be seen in the Palazzo Sclafani in Palermo and in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa.

==Popular culture==
&quot;The Triumph of Death&quot; appears as a background image for the text intro of the second part of the Monty Python sketch &quot;The Spanish Inquisition&quot;.

Heavy metal band Black Sabbath released a compilation album titles &quot;Black Sabbath Greatest Hits&quot; in 1977 which used the painting as the front and back covers.

In &quot;Underworld&quot;, a 1996 novel by Don DeLillo, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover becomes utterly intrigued by the painting after seeing it reproduced in torn pages of &quot;Life&quot; magazine and eventually obtains a print of it.

The painting plays a pivotal role in &quot;The Rich Man&#x27;s House&quot;, 2019, the final novel by Australian writer Andrew McGahan, with its theme of inevitable mortality. The rich man of the title (called Richman) has acquired the painting from the Museo del Prado and it hangs in pride of place in his mountaintop house.

<doc id="633350" wikidata="Q4118990" url="?curid=633350" title="UAV ground control station">
<text>UAV ground control station (GCS) is a land- or sea-based control centre that provides the facilities for human control of &quot;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles&quot; (UAVs or &quot;drones&quot;). It may also refer to a system for controlling rockets within or above the atmosphere, but this is typically described as a Mission Control Centre.

== Hardware ==

GCS hardware refers to the complete set of ground-based hardware systems used to control the UAV. This typically includes the Human-Machine Interface, computer, telemetry, video capture card and aerials for the control, video and data links to the UAV.

=== Fixed Installation and Vehicle Mounted GCS ===

Larger military UAVs such as the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator feature what resembles a &quot;virtual cockpit&quot;. The pilot or sensor operator sits in front of a number of screens showing the view from the UAV, a map screen and aircraft instrumentation. Control is through a conventional aircraft-style joystick and throttle, possibly with Hands on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) functionality.

In addition, the GCS consists of satellite or long-range communication links that are mounted on the roof or on a separate vehicle, container or building.

=== Portable GCS ===

Smaller UAVs can be operated with a traditional &quot;twin-stick&quot; style transmitter, as used for radio controlled model aircraft. Extending this setup with a laptop or tablet computer, data and video telemetry, and aerials, creates what is effectively a Ground Control Station.

A number of suppliers offer a combined system that consists of what looks like a modified transmitter combined with what is usually a touch screen. An internal computer running the GCS software sits behind the screen, along with the video and data links.

Larger GCS units are also available that typically fit inside flight cases. As with the smaller units, they feature an internal computer running the GCS software, along with video and data links. Large single or dual screens are also fitted that can be high-brightness or treated with an anti-glare coating to increase visibility in bright sunlight. They can either be placed on the ground, on a portable table, or feature integrated folding legs.

Some portable GCS units are in the HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick) layout. This layout includes a 3-Axis Joystick to control yaw, pitch and roll of the UAV. A slide or t-bar fader can increase or decrease the airspeed of the UAV.

== Software ==
GCS software is typically run on a ground-based computer that is used for planning and flying a mission. It provides a map screen where the user can define waypoints for the flight, and see the progress of the mission. It also serves as a “virtual cockpit”, showing many of the same instruments as in manned aircraft.

<text>The Pishon ( &quot;Pīšōn&quot;; Koine Greek: Φισών &quot;Phisṓn&quot;) is one of four rivers (along with Hiddekel (Tigris), Perath (Euphrates) and Gihon) mentioned in the Biblical Book of Genesis. In that passage, a source river flows out of Eden to water the Garden of Eden and from there divides into the four named rivers. The Pishon is described as encircling &quot;the entire land of Havilah where is gold; bdellium and onyx stone.&quot;

== Identification ==
Unlike the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Pishon has never been clearly located. It is briefly mentioned together with the Tigris in the Wisdom of Sirach (24:25/35), but this reference throws no more light on the location of the river. The Jewish–Roman historian Flavius Josephus, in the beginning of his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (1st century AD) identified the Pishon with the Ganges. The medieval French rabbi Rashi identified it with the Nile.

Some early modern scholars such as Antoine Augustin Calmet (1672–1757) and later figures such as Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenmüller (1768–1835), and Carl Friedrich Keil (1807–1888), believed the source river [for Eden] was a region of springs: &quot;The Pishon and Gihon were mountain streams. The former may have been the Phasis or Araxes, and the latter the Oxus.&quot;
James A. Sauer, former curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum, made an argument from geology and history that Pishon referred to what is now the Wadi al-Batin, a largely dry channel which begins in the Hijaz Mountains, near Medina, to run northeast to Kuwait. With the aid of satellite photos, Farouk El-Baz of Boston University traced the dry channel from Kuwait up the Wadi al-Batin and the Wadi al-Rummah system, originating near Medina at Jibāl al Abyaḑ. 

David Rohl identified Pishon with the Uizhun, placing Havilah to the northeast of Mesopotamia. The Uizhun is known locally as the Golden River. Rising near the stratovolcano Sahand, it meanders between ancient gold mines and lodes of lapis lazuli before feeding the Caspian Sea. Such natural resources correspond to the ones associated with the land of Havilah in Genesis.

Dan&#x27;el Kahn of the University of Haifa suggested that the name Pishon might come from Egyptian word pA-Shen, meaning the ocean. As can be seen from Babylonian Map of the World, the ocean can be referred to as river in the ancient Near East.

<doc id="633353" wikidata="Q6127401" url="?curid=633353" title="Sick's Stadium">
<text>Sick&#x27;s Stadium, also known as Sick&#x27;s Seattle Stadium and later as Sicks&#x27; Stadium, was a baseball park in the northwest United States in Seattle, Washington. It was located in Rainier Valley, on the NE corner of S. McClellan Street and Rainier Avenue S (currently the site of a Lowe&#x27;s hardware store). The longtime home of the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), it hosted the expansion Seattle Pilots during their only major league season in 1969.

The site was previously the location of Dugdale Field, a 1913 ballpark that was the home of the Rainiers&#x27; forerunners, the Seattle Indians. That park burned down in an Independence Day arson fire in 1932, caused by serial arsonist Robert Driscoll. Authorities would later claim that Driscoll was one of the most dangerous arsonists in the United States during the Great Depression. Until a new stadium could be built on the Dugdale site, the team played at Civic Field, a converted football stadium at the current location of Seattle Center&#x27;s Memorial Stadium.

==Baseball==
===Minor league years===
Sick&#x27;s Stadium first opened on June 15, 1938, as the home field of the Seattle Rainiers (formerly the Seattle Indians) of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). It was named after Emil Sick, owner of the team and of the Rainier Brewing Company. The stadium was constructed five years after a previous ballpark at the location, named Dugdale Field, was destroyed in an arson fire. The Rainiers played at the stadium through 1968, though they changed their name to the Seattle Angels in 1964. In 1946, the stadium was briefly the home of the Negro league Seattle Steelheads of the short-lived West Coast Negro Baseball Association, who played at the stadium while the Rainiers were on the road.

After Emil Sick died in 1964, and various members of his family shared ownership, the name of the park was changed to reflect that fact, from the singular possessive form &quot;Sick&#x27;s Stadium&quot; to the plural possessive form &quot;Sicks&#x27; Stadium&quot;.

The city bought the stadium in 1965, in anticipation that part of the property was needed for a proposed freeway.

The field alignment was southeast, home plate to center field, which results in difficult visibility conditions for the left side of the defense in the early evening hours. The recommended alignment is east-northeast.

===Seattle Pilots===
On April 11, 1969, Major League Baseball came to Seattle with the American League expansion Seattle Pilots debuting at Sick&#x27;s Stadium. Seattle had been mentioned earlier in the decade as a possible major league city. However, Sick&#x27;s Stadium had not aged gracefully. While it had once been considered one of the best stadiums in the minors, it had not been well maintained in the four years since the city bought it. The park&#x27;s rapid deterioration was obvious by the time the Cleveland Indians considered moving to Seattle in the early part of the decade. Owner William Daley dispatched general manager Gabe Paul to scout out the city. When city officials balked at paying for the upgrades necessary to bring Sick&#x27;s Stadium up to something approaching major league standards, Paul advised Daley against moving to Seattle. Charlie Finley considered moving the Kansas City Athletics to Seattle in 1967, but when he came to scout out Sick&#x27;s Stadium, he quipped that it was a &quot;pigsty&quot; and refused to consider playing there even on a temporary basis.

When the American League finally granted the franchise in October 1967, it explicitly stated that Sick&#x27;s Stadium was not suitable as a major league facility, and was only to be used on a temporary basis until a domed stadium could be completed.

It soon became obvious why Daley (who bought a stake in the Pilots) and Finley were wary about Sick&#x27;s. It was understood that the American League wanted Sick&#x27;s Stadium expanded to at least 30,000 seats by Opening Day 1969, but the league did not formally specify that figure in the franchise agreement. Eventually, the city agreed to spend at least $1.175 million to expand the stadium to 28,000 seats. That figure dropped to 25,000 when none of the bids budgeted for expanded seating. However, work didn&#x27;t begin in earnest until January, three months before Opening Day. Cost overruns brought the final renovation bill to $1.5 million. Due to poor weather and other delays, only 18,000 seats were ready by opening day. While 15,014 people showed up, those sitting in left field had to wait three innings to take their seats because workers were still putting them together by the time of the first pitch. The new right-field bleachers were nowhere near completed. There were no restrooms in some parts of the seating bowl or in any bleacher sections, forcing many fans to make do with port-a-potties. Seats in several sections had just been finished when the Pilots returned from their second road trip. However, the paint hadn&#x27;t dried by the start of a May 6 game, forcing the Pilots to foot numerous cleaning bills.

In the Pilots&#x27; defense, they were originally set to begin play in 1971, but the date was moved up two years when Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri demanded that the Pilots&#x27; expansion brethren, the Kansas City Royals, start play in 1969. Professional baseball had been played in Kansas City in one form or another from until the A&#x27;s left for Oakland after the 1967 season, and Symington would not accept the prospect of Kansas City having to wait three seasons for baseball to return. This forced Seattle to hurriedly start play in 1969 as well in order to balance the schedule.

By the middle of the season, it was obvious that Sick&#x27;s Stadium was completely inadequate even for temporary use. The stadium expanded to 25,000 seats by June, but many of those seats had obstructed views. There were no field-level camera pits, so photographers had to set up their equipment atop the grandstand roof. The clubhouse facilities were second-class. Also, no upgrades were made to the stadium&#x27;s piping, resulting in almost nonexistent water pressure when attendance was anywhere near capacity. The visiting team&#x27;s announcers couldn&#x27;t see any plays along third base or left field. The Pilots had to place a mirror in the press box, and the visiting announcers had to look into it and &quot;refract&quot; plays in those areas.

Under the circumstances, only 678,000 fans came to see the Pilots, 20th out of 24 teams and nowhere near enough to break even. The team was forced into bankruptcy after only one season. Despite the poor stadium conditions, the ticket prices were among the highest in the major leagues. The team was sold out of bankruptcy court to a Milwaukee-based group on March 31, and the team moved at the end of spring training for the 1970 season and became the Milwaukee Brewers (Milwaukee had lost the Braves to Atlanta after the 1965 season).

After two years without pro baseball, Seattle fielded a second Rainiers team that played in the Class A Northwest League between 1972 and 1976 before giving way to the major league Mariners at the Kingdome. The last professional baseball game at Sicks&#x27; Stadium was played September 1, 1976, when local product George Meyring pitched a 2-0 shutout for the Rainiers over the rival Portland Mavericks.

==Concerts and other events==
Though Sick&#x27;s Stadium was primarily a baseball venue, it also occasionally held other events, including rock concerts — most famously, an Elvis Presley concert on September 1, 1957 (one of the first concerts to be held at a major outdoor stadium), which was attended by a young Jimi Hendrix. The Sunday night concert followed an afternoon ball game during the Labor Day weekend. Hendrix himself later performed at the stadium in the rain on July 26, 1970, as did Janis Joplin, just months before their respective deaths.

In boxing, Floyd Patterson knocked out Olympic gold medalist Pete Rademacher in six rounds on August 22, 1957. Future heavyweight champion Sonny Liston defeated Portland&#x27;s Eddie Machen in a 12-round decision at Sick&#x27;s on September 7, 1960.

==After the Pilots==

From 1972 to 1976, a new Seattle Rainiers team, in the short-season Class A Northwest League, played at Sicks&#x27; to sparse audiences. The major leagues returned in 1977 with the expansion Seattle Mariners at the new Kingdome (originally approved by area voters as a condition of getting the Pilots).

The Washington Huskies baseball team used the venue during the 1973 season while their on-campus venue, Graves Field, was renovated.

In 1979, Sicks&#x27; Stadium was demolished, and an Eagle Hardware &amp; Garden store opened there in 1992, which became a Lowe&#x27;s home improvement store in 1999. The stadium site is currently marked by a sign (on the corner of Rainier and McClellan) and a replica of home plate (near the store&#x27;s exit) as well as markings inside the store where the bases were. from home plate, near the cash registers, is a circle where the mound and pitching rubber were. The store has a glass display case containing mementos of the Pilots, Rainiers, and Angels.

Most of the primary assets of Sick&#x27;s were bought for $60,000 in 1978 by Harry Ornest, the owner of the new Vancouver Canadians for use at Nat Bailey Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia. Another purchaser was Washington State University in Pullman, which bought bleachers, fencing, and the foul poles in 1979 to construct the new Buck Bailey Field. The bleachers did not fit well and were later sold.

Several dozen box seats from Sicks&#x27; Stadium were transported to Alaska and installed in Growden Memorial Park in Fairbanks, which hosts collegiate summer baseball.

<text>A birdfeeder, bird table, or tray feeder is a device placed outdoors to supply bird food to birds (bird feeding). The success of a bird feeder in attracting birds depends upon its placement and the kinds of foods offered, as different species have different preferences.

Most bird feeders supply seeds or bird food, such as millet, sunflower (oil and striped), safflower, nyjer seed, and rapeseed or canola seed to seed-eating birds.

Bird feeders often are used for birdwatching and many people keep webcams trained on feeders where birds often congregate, with some even living just near the bird feeder.

==Types of feeders==

===Seed feeders===

Seed feeders are the most common type of feeders. They can vary in design from tubes to hoppers and trays. Sunflower seeds or mixed seeds are popular for use in these feeders and will attract many songbirds such as cardinals, finches, and chickadees. Black oil sunflower seeds are especially popular with bird enthusiasts. The outer shell of the black oil sunflower seeds are thinner and easier to crack than other types of sunflower seeds. In addition, the kernel is larger than the striped or white sunflower seeds. Black oil sunflower seeds also contain a large amount of fat; therefore they are especially good to use in the winter. Most bird feeders are designed to dispense sunflower-sized foods, but there are specialty &quot;finch feeders&quot; with smaller openings to dispense the tiny Guizotia abyssinica (Niger seed), which is a favorite of smaller finches.
Seed feeders are mainly squirrel proof, tube-like or hopper. Due to the need of keeping squirrels away from the bird food, manufacturers have created different defense mechanisms that may deter squirrels from getting close to the seed. Some seed feeders come with weight sensitive technology which shuts off the access to the seed ports whenever a heavy weight is detected (as most squirrels are heavier than birds). Birds can still feed as they weigh less and the ports remain open under their weight. Other seed feeders are designed to be mounted on poles as it is believed that squirrels reach seed feeders more easily from trees than from poles. The simplest type of squirrel proof feeder is a tube-like feeder surrounded by a metal cage. These feeders also offer protection from larger and more aggressive birds. Tube seed feeders are primarily made of clear plastic tubes with plastic or metal caps, bases and perches. Hopper bird feeders look like a house and attract a wide range of birds such as finches, cardinals, blue jays, sparrows and titmice.

===Hummingbird feeders===
Hummingbird feeders, rather than dispensing seed, supply liquid nourishment to hummingbirds in the form of a sugar solution. The solution is normally 4 parts water to 1 part white sugar. Only pure refined white cane or beet sugar should be used, according to experts:
* Brown, turbinado, or raw sugar must not be used because they contain levels of iron that could be lethal.
* Honey must not be used, because it promotes dangerous fungal growth.
* The nectar should be changed every 3–5 days.

Hummingbird feeders usually have red accents or red glass to help attract hummingbirds. The sugar mixture is sometimes colored with red food coloring to attract birds, though this is not necessary if the feeder itself is red, and may actually be harmful to the birds. Yeasts tend to grow in hummingbird feeders and spoil the solution, so they must be refreshed frequently and kept very clean to avoid harm to the birds. See the article on hummingbirds for more details. Ants and other insects are also attracted to hummingbird nectar. Smearing petroleum jelly on the stem or cap of the feeder (away from the perch or flower part where the bird may come into contact with it) may prevent the ants from crawling to the feeder. When placing a hummingbird feeder, the feeder is best suited 15 to 20 feet from windows; 10 to 15 feet from the nearest cover, like shrubs or bushes; and in an open area that receives partial sun, so that hummingbirds can move from nectar source to nectar source.

Hummingbird top-fill feeders are popular among bird lovers because they are easy to fill and clean and also because they do not need to be turned upright which means that there are less chances that the nectar is spilled. The sports bottle top-fill hummingbird feeders have the design of a sports bottle, with a mechanism that works similarly to such a bottle. With this type of feeder, one has to push down the plastic container in order to close the nectar reservoir and then to unscrew the cap and pour the nectar. After the cap is replaced, the body of the nectar reservoir can be pulled up. This type of bird feeder has the advantage that the feeder does not need to be turned upside down to be refilled and which results in less nectar wasted by spilling. The traditional top-fill hummingbird feeders are one of the most popular types. There is also a plunger type of top-filling hummingbird feeder which comes with a small plunger in the container that creates the vacuum seal when the lid is tightened and the nectar will start flowing only when the lid is sealed correctly to the feeding ports.

The bottom-fill hummingbird feeders include a traditional bottom-fill feeder and several variations of it. The traditional ones are filled from an opening at the bottom of the nectar container but many manufacturers have come up with improved variations of the traditional style of feeder, to make feeding birds easier and with less nectar wasted. Some bottom-fill feeders come with a funnel-like opening at the bottom of the container, through which the feeder is filled. Other bottom-filled hummingbird feeders can be attached to one&#x27;s window to provide a close-up of the birds.

==== History of hummingbird feeders ====
Precursors to hummingbird feeders date at least to 1821, when John James Audubon reported the intentional feeding of &quot;sweetened wine&quot; to hummingbirds on Oakley Plantation in Louisiana. In 1899, Clark University professor Clifton F. Hodge wrote in &quot;Bird-Lore&quot; magazine about feeding a hummingbird that had flown into his classroom by adding drops of honey to flowers. The following year, Carolyn B. Soule successfully fed hummingbirds with an experiment involving a colored paper trumpetflower, a small glass bottle, and sugar water. Research conducted by self-taught ornithologist Althea Sherman from 1907 to 1913 revealed that hummingbirds preferred to drink sugar water from plain bottles instead of imitation flowers. Between 1927 and 1929, Benjamin Tucker and Dorothy May fed hummingbirds with cocktail glasses covered with tin or wood hole-containing tops.

Tucker subsequently developed early automatic hummingbird feeders, which were partially adapted from drinking apparatuses used for farm-raised chickens and featured spherical containers at the top with narrow necks leading down to a perching area that could feed eight hummingbirds simultaneously. Also during the 1920s, Margaret L. Bodine successfully experimented with feeding hummingbirds using two-inch-long bottles made of brightly colored materials and filled with sugar water that she left among clematis flowers. Inspired at least partially by Bodine&#x27;s work, Edith Webster similarly experimented with feeders and herself tasted nectar from various flowers to better replicate the sweetness level preferred by hummingbirds for her sugar water solution, arriving at two parts water to one part sugar as the optimal ratio. Webster&#x27;s husband, Lawrence, created cylindrical hummingbird feeders made of clear glass with two red-colored glass feeding ports at the base, and while none were sold, he made dozens for the Websters&#x27; garden.

Hummingbird feeders began appearing for sale in the early 1930s. In 1932, W. R. Sullivan invented a feeder designed to prevent other birds or insects from drinking from it, which he produced and sold locally around Kerrville, Texas. Most of the early commercial hummingbird feeders used bottles or vials full of sugar water that was dispensed via various imitation flower designs, as had their noncommercial antecedents. Prominent examples of hummingbird feeders sold between the 1930s and 1950s were those designed and built by H. R. Davis, Robert Morgan, Winthrop Packard, and the Tucker Sanctuary.

Since the start of commercialization, hummingbird feeders have largely evolved into designs of two distinct types: &quot;vacuums&quot;, which are inverted cylinders with feeding ports at the bottom, and &quot;saucers&quot;, which resemble two bowls or dishes fixed together in a top-to-bottom orientation, with feeding ports on the top side. Droll Yankees marketed one of the first prominent saucer-type feeders, the LF (&quot;Little Feeder&quot;), while numerous small companies sold vacuum-type feeders into the 1970s.

===Oriole feeders===
Oriole feeders, which are traditionally colored orange, also supply such artificial nectar and are designed to serve New World orioles, which have an unusually shaped beak and tongue. These orioles and some other birds also will come to fruit foods, such as grape jelly, or half an orange on a peg. Hummingbirds will also feed from Oriole feeders.

Oriole feeders usually have nectar containers made of glass or plastic, which are designed to attract the orioles. Oriole feeders should be cleaned at least once a week and even more often when the temperatures are higher. Oriole feeders also come in top fill, bottom fill and dish-like designs.

===Suet feeders===

A suet feeder is typically a metal cage-like construction with a plastic coating that contains a cake or block of suet to feed woodpeckers, flickers, nuthatches, and many other species of insect eaters. Suet logs are also very common. These wooden logs have holes drilled out for suet to be inserted. Suet is high in fat which helps to keep birds warm and nourished during the cold winter. Suet cakes consist of sunflower seeds and wheat or oat flakes mixed with suet, pork fat, or coconut oil.

===Other===
Birds housed in wired or glass cages can be fed with electronic bird feeders. The electronic bird feeders are capable of storing bird food for days and even weeks, depending on the feeder type and automatically replenish the dish once it is empty.

Providing a varied array of tastes and feeding venues will result in less competition for food and dining spots for birds, just as well-planned and maintained gardens provide many plants which supply different types of seeds and nectars. A shallow bird bath can attract as many birds as a feeder but it must be safe from cats, kept clean, and refreshed frequently with clean water to avoid mosquitoes. The birdbath should be placed where a frightened bird can fly up easily to an overhanging limb or resting place if disturbed or attacked.

==Squirrels==

Squirrels may also help themselves to the contents of bird feeders, often not merely feeding, but carrying away the food to their hoard. There are various anti-squirrel techniques and devices available to thwart attempts by squirrels to raid bird feeders. Several manufacturers produce feeders with perches that collapse under the weight of anything heavier than a bird, or that use battery power to shock an intruder lightly or spin the perching area to fling it off. Caged feeders are often designed so that squirrels cannot reach the seed inside, but birds can easily fly through the cage&#x27;s holes. A UK company, The Nuttery, held the original patent on this cage-within-a-cage design. Caged feeders are best to keep out gray squirrels. Chipmunks and red squirrels can usually enter caged feeders. Hot pepper in bird seed and suet has also been shown to be effective against squirrels without harming birds, as birds are not sensitive to capsaicin oleoresin, but mammals experience a strong burning sensation when exposed to it.

The placement of a bird feeder can also prevent squirrels from accessing the seed. In addition, baffles can be used that prevent squirrels from gaining their footing above feeders. Below feeders, baffles can prevent squirrels from climbing any further; however, squirrels are very agile and acrobatic and often find a way to overcome devices of any nature.

==Negative impacts==

Feeding wild birds does carry potential risks. Birds may contract and spread diseases like salmonellosis by gathering at feeders; poorly maintained feeding and watering stations may also cause illness. Birds at feeders risk predation by cats and other animals, or may incur injury by flying into windows. Steps should be taken to reduce the risks to birds, such as: regular disinfecting of feeders and watering stations, ensuring feed has not become moldy or rancid, and proper positioning of feeders to reduce crowding and window collisions. Birds are less likely to fly into windows that have a wooden lattice. Collisions with windows can also be reduced by using window decals.

Depending on the feeder design and the type of feed used, species such as the house sparrow can dominate the use of the feeder. As a result, the house sparrow population can become inflated locally where feeders are used. In North America, where the house sparrow is an invasive species, competition from house sparrows can exclude the indigenous bluebirds from available nest sites as well as attack indigenous birds.

The use of bird feeders has been claimed to cause many other environmental problems; some of these were highlighted in a 2002 front-page article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, which provoked responses nationwide from bird enthusiasts and scientists who refuted the article&#x27;s arguments.

Prior to the publication of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, Canadian ornithologist Jason Rogers also wrote about the environmental problems associated with the use of bird feeders in the journal &quot;Alberta Naturalist&quot;. In this article, Rogers explains how the use of bird feeders is inherently fraught with negative impacts and risks such as fostering dependency, altering natural distribution, density, and migration patterns, interfering with ecological processes, causing malnutrition, facilitating the spread of disease, and increasing the risk of death from cats, pesticides, hitting windows, and other causes.

As part of redistribution begun in 2012 the riding is now known by its current name and boundaries of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun while the southwestern portion joined the new riding of Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle.

<doc id="633378" wikidata="Q7058588" url="?curid=633378" title="1973 Northern Ireland border poll">
<text>The 1973 Northern Ireland border poll was a referendum held in Northern Ireland on 8 March 1973 on whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom or join with the Republic of Ireland to form a united Ireland. It was the first time that a major referendum had been held in any region of the United Kingdom. The referendum was boycotted by nationalists and resulted in a conclusive victory for remaining in the UK. On a voter turnout of 58.7 percent, 98.9 percent voted to remain in the United Kingdom, meaning the outcome among registered voters was not affected by the boycott.

==Party support==
The Unionist parties supported the &#x27;UK&#x27; option, as did the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. However, the Alliance Party was also critical of the poll. While it supported the holding of periodic plebiscites on the constitutional link with Great Britain, the party felt that to avoid the border poll becoming a &quot;sectarian head count&quot;, it should ask other relevant questions such as whether the people supported the UK&#x27;s white paper on Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, on 5 February 1973, the party&#x27;s chairman, Jim Hendron, stated that &quot;Support for the position of Northern Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom is a fundamental principle of the Alliance Party, not only for economic reasons but also because we firmly believe that a peaceful solution to our present tragic problems is only possible within a United Kingdom context. Either a Sinn Féin all-Ireland republic or a Vanguard-style Ulster republic would lead to disaster for all our people.&quot;

The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), however, called for a boycott of the referendum, urging its members on 23 January 1973 &quot;to ignore completely the referendum and reject this extremely irresponsible decision by the British Government&quot;. Gerry Fitt, leader of the SDLP, said he had organised a boycott to stop an escalation in violence.

==Violence==
The civil authorities were prepared for violence on polling day. They had put in place mobile polling stations which could be rushed into use if there was bomb damage to scheduled poll buildings. Two days before the referendum a British soldier, Guardsman Anton Brown of the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards was shot dead in Belfast as the army searched for weapons and explosives which could be used to disrupt the upcoming referendum.

Violence by both Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries still took place on polling day. The Provisional Irish Republican Army exploded several bombs across Northern Ireland and shot dead a British soldier guarding a polling station in the area of the Falls Road in Belfast. The Ulster Defence Association abducted and killed a Catholic civilian from Ballymurphy. A polling station in East Belfast guarded by the Ulster Defence Regiment was also raided by Loyalist paramilitaries who stole several self-loading rifles.

As a political response to the referendum, the Provisional Irish Republican Army also planted four car bombs in London that day, two of which went off, causing one death and injuring over 200.

==Result==

The vote resulted in an overwhelming majority of those who voted stating they wished to remain in the UK. The nationalist boycott contributed to a turnout of only 58.7% of the electorate. In addition to taking a majority of votes cast, the UK option received the support of 57.5% of the total electorate. According to the BBC, less than 1% of the Catholic population turned out to vote.

The referendum electorate consisted of 1,030,084 adults registered to vote out of a total population of approximately 1,529,993.

==Reactions==
The Government of the United Kingdom took no action on receipt of the referendum result, as the result was in favour of the status quo (Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK). It was followed by an Assembly election on 28 June 1973.

Brian Faulkner, who had been the last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, claimed the result left &quot;no doubt in any one&#x27;s mind what the wishes of Ulster&#x27;s people are. Despite an attempted boycott by some, almost 600,000 electors voted for the maintenance of the union with Great Britain&quot;. He also claimed that the poll showed that a &quot;quarter of the [N.I.] Catholic population who voted ... voted for the maintenance of the union&quot; and that the result was a &quot;blow ... against IRA mythology&quot;.

<text>Manuel Benítez Pérez (born 4 May 1936), more commonly known as El Cordobés (The Cordovan), is a Spanish bullfighter, matador, and actor active in the 1960s who brought an unorthodox acrobatic and theatrical style to the bullring.

==Career==
One of the original techniques practiced by El Cordobés was first shown at Anjucar. He waved his &quot;banderilla&quot; (Columpio) away, broke his banderillas down to &#x27;pencil length&#x27;, and standing with his back to the bull as it charged, moved his right leg out moments before the bull was upon him, causing the bull to swerve and allowing El Cordobés a moment to slam in the banderillas from just behind the left horn. This maneuver was repeated in bullfights across Spain, sometimes with even more dangerous variations, such as standing with his back to the barerra and driving in the banderillas after the horns passed either side of him. On May 20, 1964, when he made his first appearance at Las Ventas in Madrid, the bullfight ended with the near-fatal goring of El Cordobés on the horns of the bull Impulsivo. Twenty-two days later El Cordobés fought again.

By the time of his first retirement, in 1971, El Cordobés had become the highest-paid matador in history. After eight years of retirement, he returned to bullfighting in 1979. Following an incident in 1983, when a bull that he was about to fight killed an &quot;espontáneo&quot; (bystander who jumps into bullring), El Cordobés was criticized by the press for allowing it to happen. 

El Cordobés continued to make occasional appearances as a matador until 2000, when he retired permanently. He also acted in several motion pictures. El Cordobés lives in near seclusion near Córdoba. In 2016 he appeared with the woman bullfighter Conchi Ríos and Antonio Puerta in Cehegín in Murcia.

==In art, entertainment, and media==
An early biography, &quot;Or I&#x27;ll Dress You in Mourning&quot;, by journalists Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, was published in 1968 by Simon &amp; Schuster. In 1966, Italian-French singer Dalida released an album titled &quot;El Cordobes&quot; with the first track called Manuel Benitez &quot;El Cordobes&quot;. The song is available in two languages: Spanish and French. El Cordobés&#x27; story was also the basis for the musical &quot;Matador&quot; (1987) by Mike Leander and Eddie Seago. Poet Mike O&#x27;Connor included &quot;Canción del Cordobés&quot;, about the matador&#x27;s breakout performances in Mexico City in 1964, in his poetry volume &quot;When the Tiger Weeps,&quot; (2005). A song titled &quot;El Cordobés&quot; was performed by the Norwegian rap artist Diaz.

<doc id="633386" wikidata="Q4656233" url="?curid=633386" title="A Dance of the Forests">
<text>A Dance of the Forests is a play by Nigerian author Wole Soyinka. It was written and first performed in 1960 as part of the national celebrations of the independence of Nigeria. It combines Western dramatic elements and traditional Yoruba culture. &quot;A Dance of the Forests&quot; criticises the political system of postcolonial Africa, in particular British Nigeria. The play was published in London and New York in 1963 by Oxford University Press.

Wole Soyinka being against Negritude movement, he was against the over glorification of pre-colonial Nigeria and Africa at large. A Dance of the Forests was written to address such issues, illustrating that precolonial Africa, needs to change their deeds as it affect their whole life time. He uses dead characters and flashbacks to illustrate this. 

At the time of its release, it was an iconoclastic work that angered many of the elite in Soyinka&#x27;s native Nigeria. Politicians were particularly incensed at Soyinka&#x27;s prescient portrayal of post-colonial Nigerian politics as aimless and corrupt. Despite the deluge of criticism, the play remains an influential work. In it, Soyinka espouses a unique vision for a new Africa, one that is able to forge a new identity free from the influence of European imperialism. 

&quot;A Dance of the Forests&quot; is regarded as Soyinka&#x27;s theatrical debut and has been considered the most complex and difficult to understand of his plays. In it, Soyinka unveils the rotten aspects of society and demonstrates that the past is no better than the present when it comes to the seamy side of life. He lays bare the fabric of Nigerian society and warns people that they are on the brink of a new stage in their history: independence.

<text>General Electric Company, doing business as GE Aerospace, is an American aircraft engine supplier that is headquartered in Evendale, Ohio, outside Cincinnati. It is the legal successor to the original General Electric Company founded in 1892, which split into three separate companies between November 2021 and April 2024, adopting the trade name GE Aerospace after divesting its healthcare and energy divisions.

GE Aerospace both manufactures engines under its name and partners with other manufacturers to produce engines. CFM International, the world&#x27;s leading supplier of aircraft engines and GE&#x27;s most successful partnership, is a 50/50 joint venture with the French company Safran Aircraft Engines. As of 2020, CFM International holds 39% of the world&#x27;s commercial aircraft engine market share (while GE Aerospace itself holds a further 14%). GE Aerospace&#x27;s main competitors in the engine market are Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce.

The division operated under the name of General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) until September 2005, and as GE Aviation until July 2022. In July 2022, GE Aviation changed its name to GE Aerospace in a move executives say reflects the engine maker&#x27;s intention to broaden its focus beyond aircraft engines. In April 2024, GE Aerospace became the only business line of the former General Electric conglomerate, after it had completed the divestiture of GE HealthCare and GE Vernova (its energy businesses division).

== History ==

=== Early efforts ===
General Electric had a long history in steam turbine work, dating back to the 1900s. In 1903 they hired Sanford Alexander Moss, who started the development of turbosuperchargers at GE. This led to a series of record-breaking flights over the next ten years. At first, the role of the high-altitude flight was limited, but in the years immediately prior to WWII they became standard equipment on practically all military aircraft. GE was a world leader in this technology; most other firms concentrated on the mechanically simpler supercharger driven by the engine itself, while GE had spent considerable effort developing the exhaust-driven turbo system that offered higher performance.

This work made them the natural industrial partner to develop jet engines when Frank Whittle&#x27;s W.1 engine was demonstrated to Hap Arnold in 1941. A production license was arranged in September, and several of the existing W.1 test engines shipped to the US for study, where they were converted to US manufacture as the I-A. GE quickly started production of improved versions; the I-16 (J31) was produced in limited numbers starting in 1942, and the much more powerful I-40 (J33) followed in 1944, which went on to power the first US combat-capable jet fighters, the P-80 Shooting Star.

Early jet engine work took place at GE&#x27;s Syracuse, New York, (steam turbine) and Lynn, Massachusetts, (supercharger) plants, but soon concentrated at the Lynn plants. On 31 July 1945 the Lynn plant became the &quot;Aircraft Gas Turbine Division&quot;. GE was repeatedly unable to deliver enough engines for Army and Navy demand, and production of the I-40 (now known as the J33) was also handed to Allison Engines in 1944. After the war ended, the Army canceled its orders for GE-built J33s and turned the entire production over to Allison, and the Syracuse plant closed.

=== Military and civilian expansion ===
These changes in fortune led to debate within the company about carrying on in the aircraft engine market. However, the engineers at Lynn pressed ahead with the development of a new engine, the TG-180, which was designated J35 by the US military.

Development funds were allotted in 1946 for a more powerful version of the same design, the TG-190. This engine finally emerged as the famed General Electric J47, which saw a great demand for several military aircraft; a second manufacturing facility in Evendale, Ohio, near Cincinnati, was opened. J47 production ran to 30,000 engines by the time the lines closed down in 1956. Further development of the J47 by led to the J73, and from there into the much more powerful J79. The J79 was GE&#x27;s second &quot;hit&quot;, leading to a production run of 17,000 in several different countries. The GE and Lockheed team that developed the J79 and the F-104 Mach 2 fighter aircraft received the 1958 Collier Trophy for outstanding technical achievement in aviation. Other successes followed, including the T58 and T64 turboshaft engines, the J85 turbojet, and F404 turbofan.

Starting in 1961, General Electric started one of their most important research and development efforts, the GE1 technology demonstrator (originally designated the X101). The GE1 was a basic gas generator (compressor, combustor and turbine) onto which a variety of components such as fans, afterburners or other thrust vectoring devices could be added later. The design incorporated technologies such as a scaled compressor with variable stator vanes, an annual combustor, turbine-cooling advancements, and new materials for several government research programs. The US Government initially supported development of the GE1 to produce the J97 engine. The GE1 design and technology helped General Electric produce a range of engines, including the GE1/6 turbofan demonstrator for the TF39 engine the GE4 for the Boeing 2707 supersonic airliner, and the GE9 engine for the USAF&#x27;s Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft, later GE F101 engines for the B-1 bomber.: The General Electric F101 was later developed into the General Electric F110 and CFM International CFM56 engines.

The TF39 was the first high-bypass turbofan engine to enter production. Entered into the C-5 Galaxy contest in 1964 against similar designs from Curtiss-Wright and Pratt &amp; Whitney, GE&#x27;s entry was selected as the winner during the final down-select in 1965. This led to a civilian model, the CF6, which was offered for the Lockheed L-1011 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 projects. Although Lockheed later changed their engine to the Rolls-Royce RB211, the DC-10 continued with the CF6, and this success led to widespread sales on many large aircraft including the Boeing 747.

Another military-to-civilian success followed when GE was selected to supply engines for the S-3 Viking and Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, developing a small high-bypass engine using technologies from the TF39. The resulting TF34 was adapted to become the CF34, whose wide variety of models powers many of the regional jets flying today.

In the early 1970s, GE was also selected to develop a modern turboshaft engine for helicopter use, the T700. It has been further developed as the CT7 turboprop engine for regional transports.

=== Commercial aviation powerplants ===
In 1974 GE entered into an agreement with Snecma of France, forming CFM International to jointly produce a new mid-sized turbofan, which emerged as the CFM56. A 50/50 joint partnership was formed with a new plant in Evendale, OH to produce the design. At first, sales were very difficult to come by, and the project was due to be canceled. Only two weeks before this was to happen, in March 1979, several companies selected the CFM56 to re-engine their existing Douglas DC-8 fleets. By July 2010, CFM International had delivered their 21,000th engine of the CFM56 family, with an ongoing production rate of 1250 per year, against a four-year production backlog.

The success of the CFM led GE to join in several similar partnerships, including Garrett AiResearch for the CFE CFE738, Pratt &amp; Whitney on the Engine Alliance GP7000, and, more recently, Honda for the GE Honda Aero Engines small turbofan project. GE also continued the development of its own lines, introducing new civilian models like the GE90, and military designs like the General Electric F110.

=== GE Aerospace today ===
GE and competitor Rolls-Royce were selected by Boeing to power its new 787. GE Aviation&#x27;s offering is the GEnx, a development of the GE90. The engine was also the exclusive power plant on the Boeing 747-8.

The Lynn facility continues to assemble jet engines for the United States Department of Defense, subsidiary services, and commercial operators. Engines assembled at this plant include the F404, F414, T700, and CFE738. The plant at Lynn also produces the -3 and -8 variants of the CF34 regional jet engine, the CT7 commercial turboprop power plant, and commercial versions of the T700 turboshaft which are also called the CT7.

The Evendale plant conducts final assembly for the CFM International&#x27;s CFM56, CF6, as well as LM6000, and LM2500 power plants.

The Durham, North Carolina, facility conducts final assembly for the CFM LEAP, GEnx, CFM56, GE90, GP7200, and CF34 power plants.

Crucial parts for these engines are crafted in secondary GE Aviation facilities, such as those in Bromont, Quebec; Hooksett, New Hampshire; Wilmington, North Carolina; Asheville, North Carolina; Madisonville, Kentucky; Rutland, Vermont; and Muskegon, Michigan; where the engine blades and vanes are manufactured.

Smiths Group and General Electric announced on January 15, 2007, that the former was divesting Smiths Aerospace to the latter for £2.4 billion (US$ 4.8 billion). GE Aviation closed the transaction on May 4, 2007. Smiths Aerospace, which was an important supplier, became an operating subsidiary of GE Aviation known as GE Aviation Systems. This acquisition will reportedly give the combined unit the clout to resist pricing pressures from its two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus. Analysts further assert that it enables General Electric to acquire assets similar to those it desired in its failed bid for Honeywell in 2000.

Along with the purchase of Smiths Aerospace, the purchase included opening the first University Development Center at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, in the effort to work with engineering students to provide training in engineering and software development. The program has performed well and GE Aviation has announced further UDC openings at Kansas State University.
In July 2008, governments in the Persian Gulf reached agreements with GE to expand engine maintenance operations there. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mubadala Development Company, which owns Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies, an overhaul, and maintenance company, signed an agreement worth an estimated $8 billion with GE; Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies will maintain and overhaul GE engines used in commercial aircraft purchased by airlines based in the Persian Gulf.

On December 23, 2012, GE announced that it has agreed to purchase the aeronautical division of Avio, an Italy-based manufacturer of aviation propulsion components and systems for civil and military aircraft, for $4.3 billion U.S. (EUR3.3 billion).

GE Aviation follows through to develop a supersonic engine concept for Aerion with a configuration accommodating reasonably well requirements for supersonic speed, subsonic speed and noise levels.

On July 18, 2022, GE announced that GE Aviation had been renamed &quot;GE Aerospace&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcock 7/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and would become the successor to the GE company once the spinoffs of its subsidiaries are completed. GE Aerospace will own the GE trademark and logo, and will license the brand to the other companies, GE HealthCare and GE Vernova.

==== Additive manufacturing ====
Recently, they have started incorporating 3D printing technologies in their engines and have incorporated the manufacturing process in the newly designed GE9X, the largest jet engine in the world.

GE acquired Arcam EBM for electron beam melting, Concept Laser for laser melting, and material provider AP&amp;C.
Metal casting improves through competition with metal additive manufacturing, for which GE Additive believes it will soon compete with metal forging which will then be enhanced in response.
Additive manufacturing is focused on new builds but can be used for part replacement: when complexity rise, costs can stays level – for example, replacing a turbine consisting of 300 components with one piece.
The electron beam melting has good speed for economy, precision to reduce processing work, and size capability for larger parts; the hot process reduces stresses in the part and penetrates deeper than laser for thicker parts with coarser, cheaper metal powders.
Additive techniques can be used across the engine and even in the over hot section.
They are used in the CT7 combustor liner, for GE9X low pressure turbine blades – the first rotating parts – and for 16 parts in the ATP, including an 80 parts heat exchanger consolidated into one.

<doc id="633390" wikidata="Q5305572" url="?curid=633390" title="Drake's Cakes">
<text>Drake&#x27;s is a brand of American baked goods. The company was founded by Newman E. Drake in 1896 in Harlem, New York, as The N.E. Drake Baking Company, but it is now owned by McKee Foods. The company makes snack cake products such as Devil Dogs, Funny Bones, Coffee Cakes, Ring Dings, and Yodels. Drake&#x27;s has traditionally been marketed primarily in the Northeastern U.S., but it expanded to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern U.S. regions in 2016. The products are made under the Orthodox Union kosher certification guidelines.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Drake&#x27;s brand began as The N.E. Drake Baking Company, incorporated on November 14, 1896, in New York City and founded by Newman E. Drake. The first bakery was in Harlem at 36–38 West 135th Street.

Drake&#x27;s youngest brother Judson was working with him at the founding, and his brother Charles was with him in the later business in Brooklyn. Judson left the business in 1898 for the National Biscuit Company where he had a long and well-regarded career in bakery management. Charles was a vice president for the Brooklyn business, but he sold his interest and retired in 1907. At some point, all four of Newman&#x27;s sons worked in the business.

Newman Drake came into this entrepreneurial venture with experience in large scale commercial baking. In 1888, he joined Vanderveer and Holmes Biscuit Company, and he had become a salesman traveling internationally for this cracker business by 1894. He was traveling in England on business in 1893–94 when he observed commercially baked fine cakes sold in grocery stores, and he was inspired to bring the idea to America.

By March 1898, retailer ads featured Drake&#x27;s pound cakes by brand name in various flavors. The ads stated that the products were baked fresh daily and sold for 17 cents per pound. In 1900, retailer ads featured Drake&#x27;s layer cakes with chocolate or vanilla icing at 18 cents. One Drake&#x27;s ad touted that the price was half of what it would cost to make at home. By 1901, retailer ads referred to Drake&#x27;s &quot;celebrated&quot; pound cakes and included Drake&#x27;s macaroons.

=== National Biscuit Company ===
In the 1890s, the cracker industry consolidated in a multitiered fashion. In 1898, the three major players consolidated into one large enterprise, the National Biscuit Company, later known as Nabisco. As early as 1899, but definitively by November 1900, the National Biscuit Company had purchased the Drake bakery and referred to the bakery as the N.E. Drake Baking Co. Branch. Retailer ads show that the N.E. Drake&#x27;s Famous Loaf Cakes continued to sell under that brand name at least to December 30, 1902. The Drake Baking Company was dissolved in 1903, however National Biscuit Company continued to produce cakes and macaroons at the same Harlem bakery at least into 1908, but the products were under brand names other than Drake, for example Regina, Golden Glory, and Imperial. It is not known how Newman Drake was able to hold onto the Drake brand for later Drake baking enterprises, but National Biscuit Company moved onto other brand names.

=== Drake Brothers Company ===
On December 4, 1902, Drake reestablished his business as Drake Brothers Company with his brother Charles and his brother-in-law Frank S. Vreeland and by at least May 10, 1903, Drake was operating a bakery at 1006 Wallabout Market in Brooklyn, New York. Newman was president, his brother Charles was vice president, and sons John Harold and Walter were bakers. By 1904, Newman&#x27;s third son, Arthur, was working in the business as a salesman.

An article covering a Brooklyn food show in April 1904 indicated that Drake continued to produce pound cakes, macaroons, and other cakes at the Brooklyn bakery. The firm was noted as having been the first to have produced cakes in large quantities for grocery stores, which must reference the origins of the Harlem bakery. The new bakery was servicing over 1,000 stores in Brooklyn and extended &quot;over a large portion of surrounding country.&quot;

In 1904, Drake Brothers began sales recognition dinners that became grand affairs with speakers, guests, and monetary awards recognizing sales performance. A photograph of the fourteenth annual dinner in 1917, captures the grandeur of the event held at Silsbe and Son Oyster Bar and Chop House in Manhattan (established 1863), with attendees in suits, custom menus on the tables, tuxedoed wait staff, and lavish décor.

In 1905, Drake opened a bakery in Boston&#x27;s Roxbury neighborhood at 83-85 Savin Street with J. Harold Drake, Newman&#x27;s son, as manager.

The Wallabout Market bakery expanded in 1909 with the addition into 1704–1705 Wallabout Market and the addition of a 16-foot oven. Also in 1909, Drake&#x27;s commissioned &quot;Drake&#x27;s Cake Walk&quot;, sheet music for a &quot;rag&quot; or &quot;ragtime&quot; music for piano.

In 1910, Newman Vanderveer Drake, Newman E. Drake&#x27;s youngest son, joined the firm in Wallabout Market.

In May 1913, Drake Brothers announced that they would build a new five story bakery built of brick and concrete on Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn on a lot 80 by 125 feet. The ovens were on the top floor to allow the heat to escape, mixing was on the fourth floor, packing was on the third floor, offices on the second floor, and shipping and receiving on the ground level as seen in photographs of the facility. The facility had a laundry to clean the white uniforms. There was a rooftop garden that served as a break area.

=== Early branding and advertising ===
Drake Brothers was recognized in a leading advertising magazine of the day for branding and advertising efforts. With much of the product sold by the pound, the products were vulnerable to substitution by retailers. Drake implemented pan liners that were perforated with the Drake&#x27;s brand name so that the product could be identified by the end consumer. Drake&#x27;s advertised this feature. Drake also made wide use of the trademark on trucks, advertising, and &quot;everything that leaves our bakery&quot;.

A White (brand) three-ton truck in the small fleet at the Drake&#x27;s Boston bakery was featured in a trucking publication in 1914 for having operated for 14 months without the loss of a day.

In 1920 and again in 1927, Drake&#x27;s added garages to store their fleet of vehicles just down the street from the bakery at 35-37 Clinton Avenue and 41-43 Clinton Avenue.

In the early 1900s, Newman Drake was looking for something new and different to grace the door of his delivery trucks. Joseph Gross, a German immigrant who came to the U.S. in 1898 and worked as striper painting lines and designs on horse wagons and automobiles, drew the original Drake&#x27;s logo which consisted of a duck with a chef&#x27;s hat holding a tray of cakes. Drake was so pleased with the design that Gross received a bonus in the amount of $500 for his work.

=== Drake Bakeries, Inc. ===
On July 29, 1924, a new corporation was formed as Drake Bakeries, Incorporated. Ralph Ward became president of the company. Ralph Ward was the grandson of the founder of Ward Baking Company, a major bakery enterprise founded in 1849 that went on to be Continental Baking and introduce the Hostess brand, develop competitive products like Twinkies, and eventually after transitioning to Interstate Bakeries Corporation, own the Drake&#x27;s brand in 1998, 74 years later, after having made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the Drake&#x27;s brand in 1986.

The preferred shares of Drake Bakeries, Incorporated were owned by Bessemer Investment Company, the investment arm of the Bessemer Trust which was founded in 1907 by Henry Phipps from proceeds from the sale of Carnegie Steel, which Phipps founded with Andrew Carnegie. Newman E. Drake and other Drake family members, Ralph Ward and other Ward family investments, B. B. Vanderveer, and others were among the closely held group of common stockholders of Drake Bakeries.

In 1925, Drake Bakeries advertised with full page ads a new freshness policy where they would remove products from store shelves after 48 hours. The ad also featured recipes for three Drake&#x27;s products, highlighting to readers the wholesome ingredients used and how much easier it would be to buy the same product you would make at home from Drake. The ad also introduced the products in cartons, termed the &quot;Fresh Cake&quot; package.

In 1925, Drake&#x27;s began a series of collectable cards including two featuring Babe Ruth. These cards had brand information on the back. Drake&#x27;s baseball cards continued for decades.

Also in 1925, work began on a new three story bakery in Irvington, New Jersey, near Newark.

One of the top sellers for Drake&#x27;s still today, Devil Dogs, was filed for trademark protection in 1926 and shown as first sold in commerce on June 15, 1926. The owner of the trademark was S. Gumpert Co., Inc. of Brooklyn.

Yankee Doodles, a chocolate cupcake with creme filling and no icing, was first sold in interstate commerce in 1928 by the Yankee Cake Company of Providence, Rhode Island. The firm built a bakery around that time at 24 Althea Street in Providence. In 1936, Drake&#x27;s was running ads for Yankee Doodles under the Drake&#x27;s brand. Around 1937, Drake Bakeries was sharing the building with Yankee Cake Company and later became sole occupant. The &quot;Old Formula Book&quot; of Drake Bakeries from the late 1930s to early 1940s references the Providence bakery. The Yankee Cake Company was stated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Drake Bakeries in a 1941 article.

On August 28, 1928, Drake Bakeries was purchased by acquisition of common stock by Central Distributors, Inc. Central Distributors was formed March 9, 1928, by Ralph Ward, his cousin, William Ward, and Benjamin Titman as a holding company for food companies. Drake common shareholders received shares in Central Distributors, Inc. Newman E. Drake and Ralph Ward were signatories of documents related to the purchase.

Less than a year later, on August 8, 1929, The Borden Company purchased Central Distributors, Inc. for Borden stock, gaining control of Drake Bakeries, Inc. as it was a company held within Central Distributors, Inc. Ralph Ward became a vice president within The Borden Company in October 1931 while continuing to serve as President of Drake Bakeries, Inc. without interruption.

In 1929, Drake begins advertising that the products are wrapped in cellophane, noting that shoppers could see what they were buying and that it was a &quot;flavor-sealed&quot; package.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
Newman E. Drake, the founder of the business, died March 18, 1930, at 69 years old. one month after its founder&#x27;s death his wife Elizabeth Drake and their son Arthur Drake took over to continue running the business, in April 1930.

In December 1930, Drake&#x27;s Coffee Cakes, still one of the top-selling products, came on the scene in newspaper advertisements that mentioned a radio broadcast that offered to share the recipe. The advertisement is another example of Drake&#x27;s forward stance promoting product quality. The ad is assumed to be the introduction of coffee cakes because the product is not listed in previous advertisements, even as late as 1929, that provide a listing of cake products.

On August 28, 1933, Drake Bakeries Incorporated is established at 2224 N. Marshall Street in Philadelphia. In 1941, in addition to the aforementioned Brooklyn, Boston, Irvington, NJ, and Providence, bakeries, the Philadelphia branch is noted as well as two distribution points in the Bronx and Jamaica (Queens) in an article. Photographs of delivery vehicles for the Philadelphia branch exist, but very little other information has been found regarding this bakery. By the mid-1950s, an order ticket showing the various Drake&#x27;s bakeries does not include a Philadelphia bakery.

Drake&#x27;s participated in the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair (in Queens) with Drake&#x27;s cake stand providing cake to attendees.

During World War II, Drake&#x27;s production was limited due to rationing of sugar and shortening. Ralph Ward, president of the Drake Bakeries, Incorporated, was the president of the American Bakers Association (American Institute of Baking) in the 1942–1944 term and chairman of the War Advisory Committee of the American Bakers Association.

By the end of 1949, Drake Bakeries had a bakery at 21 – 30 44th Avenue in Long Island City, NY (Queens).

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
While the Devil Dogs brand was first owned by another company (see 1926), Devil Dogs are marketed in advertisements under the Drake&#x27;s brand in 1956.

Drake&#x27;s Ring Dings launched in January 1958, still one of the top-selling items.

Drake&#x27;s Funny Bones launched on April 12, 1961.

On April 18, 1962, Drake Bakeries had a case heard in front of the United States Supreme Court.

Drake&#x27;s Yodels launched on August 15, 1962, and continues to be one of their top-selling items. 

Drake&#x27;s Fruit Doodles, a trademarked name for fruit pies, were introduced on October 29, 1964, but were known as Drake&#x27;s Fruit Pies by the early 1970s.

In 1969, a bakery in Wayne, New Jersey, was built to supplement the existing bakeries in Brooklyn, Boston, Long Island City, and Newark.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In 1981, Drake Bakeries conducted a contest to name the duck mascot. Webster was the selected name.

On July 1, 1986, Borden announced the sale of Drake Bakeries to Ralston Purina Co. to be part of their Continental Baking Co. subsidiary. Ralston Purina paid $115 million for Drake. Tasty Baking Co. filed a federal antitrust suit against Ralston in August 1986 and was successful with efforts to block Ralston&#x27;s Continental Baking subsidiary from holding the Drake&#x27;s brand along with its existing Hostess brand.

On July 13, 1987, Ralston Purina Co. announced its agreement to sell Drake Bakeries to a private group led by Drake management and funded by support from Rock Capital Partners L.P. Purina completed the sale of the Drake Bakery unit which was sold for $176 million on August 22, 1987. Rock Capital Partners was formed by the heirs of John D. Rockefeller with funds from mortgaging Rockefeller Center.

By September 1987, Drake management informed the route salespeople that they would need to buy their routes or lose their jobs as a cost savings effort and an opportunity to increase earnings for the salespeople. Union officials representing the route salespeople condemned the effort.

In April 1988, Drake Bakeries held a 100th-anniversary celebration with the cutting of a 500-pound Ring Ding. Evidence points to 1896 as being the founding of the company, and 1888 was simply the year its founder entered the baking industry (in another company), so this celebration was technically about eight years early.

On December 31, 1990, Rock Capital Partners sold Drake Bakeries to Culinar Inc. for $35 million. Culinar was a CA$500 million sales Canadian food company based in Montreal that held the popular Canadian cake brand Vachon.

Culinar refocused on improved bakery operations resulting in greater efficiencies, gained work rule concessions, and reconfigured routes resulting in improved profitability.

On August 16, 1998, Interstate Bakeries Corporation completed the purchase of Drake Bakeries from Culinar Inc. Interstate Bakeries added Drake&#x27;s to their line including the Hostess brand of competitive products. In the fiscal year, Hostess had one major acquisition (Drake) and one minor acquisition (My Bread Baking Co.) with the total paid of $106 million. If the purchase price was proportional to sales, Interstate may have paid in the neighborhood of $80 million for Drake Baking. Gilles Boudreau, Vice President and Controller for Drake during the Culinar era and later Vice President of Finance with Interstate Bakeries stated that Hostess paid around $100 million for Drake Bakeries.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
Hostess Brands Inc. (formerly Interstate Bakeries Corporation) filed for bankruptcy a second time on January 11, 2012 and eventually filed for liquidation on November 16, 2012.

On April 9, 2013, McKee Foods Corporation completed the purchase of the Drake&#x27;s brand for $27.5 million out of liquidation from Hostess Brands. McKee Foods reintroduced the Drake&#x27;s top-selling items on September 22, 2013.

During the fall of 2017, and without warning to consumers, McKee stopped production and distribution of Drake&#x27;s Coffee Cakes. On July 27, 2018, McKee announced that Drake&#x27;s Coffee Cakes would return in the fall.

==In popular culture==
Drake&#x27;s Coffee Cakes are mentioned in the season 3 episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The Suicide&quot;, which aired on January 29, 1992. In addition, in the season 5 episode &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, which aired on February 3, 1994, George Costanza suggests bringing Ring Dings and Pepsi to a dinner party. As a result, the brand has become associated with &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. They also became somewhat associated with comedienne Rosie O&#x27;Donnell when she gave them away on her TV talk show. Yodels are referenced in the season 4 episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; titled &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rodeo&quot;, which aired on February 7, 2000. Drake&#x27;s Devil Dogs are mentioned in the season 4 episode of the HBO series The Sopranos titled &quot;The Weight&quot;, which aired on October 6, 2002.

<text>Caïssa is a fictional (anachronistic) Thracian dryad portrayed as the goddess of chess. She was first mentioned during the Renaissance by Italian poet Hieronymus Vida.

==Vida&#x27;s poem==
The concept of Caïssa originated in a 658-line poem called &quot;Scacchia Ludus&quot; published in 1527 by Hieronymus Vida (Marco Girolamo Vida), which describes in Latin Virgilian hexameters a chess game between Apollo and Mercury in the presence of the other gods, and among them a dryad of chess named Schacchia. In it, to avoid unclassical words such as &quot;rochus&quot; (chess rook) or &quot;alfinus&quot; (chess bishop), the rooks are described as towers (armored howdahs) on elephants&#x27; backs, and the bishops as archers:

A leaked unauthorized 742-line draft version was published in 1525. Its text is very different, and in it the chess rook is a cyclops, and the chess bishop is a centaur archer.

The description of towers led to the modern name &quot;castle&quot; for the chess rook, and thus the term &quot;castling&quot;, and the modern shape of the European rook chesspiece. Also for a time, some chess players in Europe called the rook &quot;elephant&quot; and the bishop &quot;archer&quot;. In German, &quot;Schütze&quot; (&quot;archer&quot;) became a general word for a chess bishop until displaced by &quot;Läufer&quot; (&quot;runner&quot;) in the 18th century.

== William Jones&#x27;s poem ==
The young English orientalist William Jones re-used the idea of a chess poem in 1763, in his own poem &quot;Caïssa or The Game at Chess&quot; written in English heroic couplets. In his poem, Caïssa initially repels the advances of the god of war, Mars. Spurned, Mars seeks the aid of Euphron, God of Sport (Jones&#x27;s invention), brother of Venus, who creates the game of chess as a gift for Mars to win Caïssa&#x27;s favor.

It is an unproven assumption that Jones&#x27;s name &quot;Caïssa&quot; (ka-is-sa) is an equivalent to Vida&#x27;s name &quot;Scacchia&quot; (ska-ki-a).

The English version of Philidor&#x27;s 1777 &quot;Systematic introduction to the game and the analysis of chess&quot; contained Jones&#x27;s poem. In 1851 the poem was translated into French by Camille Théodore Frédéric Alliey.

==Modern use==
Caïssa is referred to in chess commentary.
* Garry Kasparov uses this reference now and again, especially in his five-volume work &quot;My Great Predecessors&quot;. He cites her as a metaphor for good luck – &quot;Caïssa was with me&quot; – especially in unclear situations, for example in sacrifices.
* The 1994 book &quot;The March of Chess Ideas&quot; by Anthony Saidy extensively uses Caïssa as well.
* T. R. Dawson extensively used Caïssa, both as a character to provide literary narrative to accompany his problem collections, and merely as a convenient personification of chess.
* The chess variant Caïssa Britannia, created by Fergus Duniho, was named after Caïssa. 
* When writing about chess, Heinrich Fraenkel used the pseudonym &quot;Assiac&quot;, which is &quot;Caïssa&quot; spelled backwards.
* Antonio Radić, a Croatian YouTuber who runs the channel &#x27;agadmator&#x27;s Chess Channel&#x27;, has created a chess-based manga named &quot;Age of Caissa&quot;, depicting a post-apocalyptic world ruled by artificial intelligence.

The computer program that won the first World Computer Chess Championship (in 1974) was named Kaissa.

The card game &quot;&quot; features a program type named Caïssa, which are modeled after chess pieces.

In Michael Chabon’s novel The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union, a character writes an Acrostic letter that spells Caissa.

Victoria Winifred&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Princess, the Knight, and the Lost God: A Chess Story&quot;, features Caïssa as a character.

<doc id="633401" wikidata="Q15063" url="?curid=633401" title="2003 Australian Grand Prix">
<text>The 2003 Australian Grand Prix (formally the 2003 Foster&#x27;s Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 9 March 2003 at the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit. The race was won by McLaren driver David Coulthard, who took the 13th and final race victory of his Formula One career.

==Report==
===Background===
There was a lot of speculation about how the new set of rules that debuted in this race would affect Ferrari, which were the ones to cause the changes after their dominant 2002 season.

===Qualifying===
Qualifying was an all Ferrari affair, with Schumacher edging out Barrichello. Montoya took third, with Frentzen, Panis and Villeneuve putting in good performances for 4th, 5th and 6th. The McLarens had poor qualifying, with Coulthard in 11th, and Räikkönen making a mistake, and ending up 15th.

===Race===
It rained heavily before the race, and the track started in half-wet conditions. Räikkönen stopped for dry tyres at the end of the formation lap. Montoya and Panis also started on dry tyres, while the Ferraris, Saubers and BARs were on wet tyres. Barrichello jumped the start, and received a drive-through penalty. Schumacher led at the end of lap 1, with Barrichello in close company. Montoya was 6 seconds behind in third, followed by Frentzen and Villeneuve. Panis struggled on dry tyres, with the Renaults, Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard climbing quickly.

However, the track dried quickly and abnormal tire wear soon occurred on the two Ferraris. After two laps Coulthard, who started on wet tyres, returned to the pits to replace them with dry ones. Barrichello took his penalty, and on his in-lap, lost traction on a quickly drying track, crashing at Turn Five on lap five, followed by rookie Ralph Firman, who had climbed to eighth by lap seven on his dry Bridgestones.

Meanwhile Räikkönen quickly recovered from the back, while Coulthard, on dry tyres, set the fastest lap of the race. Despite this, Ferrari chose not to immediately call Schumacher back to the pits. Da Matta’s debut also came to a premature end when he spun into the gravel at turn 3. Schumacher dropped to eighth, pitting for dry tyres, with the leaders pitting just before a safety car to clear the stranded cars. Mark Webber&#x27;s Jaguar had climbed to sixth, but his rear suspension broke just after the restart and he stopped in an awkward place, prompting a second appearance of the safety car.

Montoya, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher took advantage of the interruption to refuel, but the German driver lost a lot of time due to a spin and restarted at the back of the group. The safety car returned to the pits at the end of lap 20, with Räikkönen in the lead threatened by Michael Schumacher, who was in turn followed by Coulthard, Villeneuve, Button, Montoya, Panis and Frentzen. On lap 25 Villeneuve, who was having problems with the radio, entered the pits together with his teammate Button, causing a lot of confusion in the team garage and causing the Englishman to lose almost twenty seconds. Meanwhile Michael Schumacher unsuccessfully attacked Räikkönen. Unable to pass him, the German driver returned to the pits on lap 29, imitated three laps later by the McLaren drivers. Montoya then moved on to lead, followed by Räikkönen, Schumacher, Coulthard, Trulli and Alonso. Räikkönen had his turn leading the race until he received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. Räikkönen served the penalty on lap 39, returning to the track behind the two Renaults. When Montoya refueled for the last time on lap 42, Michael Schumacher found himself in the lead.

The German driver, however, damaged the flow diverters of his Ferrari by driving too violently over a curb. Some pieces of the damaged aerodynamic appendages broke off and slipped under the body. The race direction then displayed the black-orange flag to the German, which indicates the obligation to return to the pits within three laps for repairs. Schumacher, who still had to make another pit stop, was therefore forced to do so during the 46th lap. He missed out on the podium for the first time since the 2001 Italian Grand Prix and ending Ferrari&#x27;s 53 consecutive podium finishes. It was the first time since the 1999 European Grand Prix that neither of the Ferraris finished on the podium. When Williams seemed to have the first victory of the year in their pocket, Montoya spun after entering the first corner too fast, with eight laps from the end and without any pressure from his rivals. Montoya returned to the track, but lost first place to Coulthard, who won what turned out to be his last race victory. Montoya was visibly frustrated on the podium.

This was the first time that Michelin tires have dominated the podium since the 1984 Portuguese Grand Prix. It was the first time since the 1998 Italian Grand Prix that no Bridgestone-shod cars finished in the podium positions.

<text>Eleazar of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] (אלעזר מוורמייזא - also מגרמייזא of Garmiza or Garmisa) (c. 1176–1238), or Eleazar ben Judah ben Kalonymus, also sometimes known today as Eleazar Rokeach (&quot;Eleazar the Perfumer&quot; אלעזר רקח) from the title of his &quot;Book of the Perfumer&quot; (&quot;Sefer ha rokeah&quot; ספר הרקח)—where the numerical value of &quot;Perfumer&quot; (in Hebrew) is equal to Eleazar, was a leading Talmudist and Kabbalist, and the last major member of the &quot;Hasidei Ashkenaz&quot;, a group of German Jewish pietists.

== Biography ==
Eleazar was most likely born in Mainz. Through his father Judah ben Kalonymus, he was a descendant of the great Kalonymus family of Mainz. Eleazar was also a disciple of Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg (Judah he-Hasid), who initiated him into the study of the Kabbalah, at that time little known in Germany. According to Zunz, Eleazar was hazzan at Erfurt before he became rabbi at Worms. In 1233 he took part in the Synod of Mainz which enacted the body of regulations known as &quot;Takkanot Shum&quot; (ShUM = &quot;Speyer, Worms, Mainz&quot;), of which he was a signatory.

According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, Eleazar underwent great sufferings during the Crusades. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; states that on the night of 22 Kislev, 1196, he was engaged in his commentary on &quot;Genesis&quot; (Eleazar relates that he had reached the parashah Vayeshev), when two Crusaders entered his house and killed his wife Dulca (Dolce), his two daughters Belet (Belette) and Hannah, and wounded him and his son Jacob who did not escape. His wife had conducted a business in parchment scrolls in order to support the family and enable him to devote all his time to study. Many of the &quot;piyyutim&quot; he authored protest at Israel&#x27;s suffering and hope for redemption and revenge against her tormentors. He also recorded the deaths of his family in a eulogy.

Eleazar developed a vigorous activity in many directions. On the one hand, he was a Talmudist of vast erudition, a liturgist gifted with a clear and easy style, and an astronomer, and was well versed in the sciences open to the Jews of Germany at that time. At the same time, he was an adventurous mystic who experienced visions, seeing legions of angels and demons. He exerted himself to spread mystical systems which went far beyond the conceptions of the classical authors of Jewish esoterica. In his mystical works he developed and gave a new impulse to the mysticism associated with the letters of the alphabet. By the gematria and notarikon systems of interpretation found in the Talmud, Eleazar invented new combinations by which miracles could be performed. The haggadic anthropomorphism which he had combated in his earlier works (&quot;Ha-Roḳeaḥ,&quot; &quot;Sha&#x27;are ha-Sod weha-Yiḥud&quot;) occupied later the foremost place in his mystical writings.
Eleazar&#x27;s great merit therefore lies not only in his new mystical system, but also in his ethical works. In these he shows greatness of soul and a piety bordering upon asceticism. Though so severely tried by fate, he inculcates cheerfulness, patience, and love for humanity. He died at Worms in 1238.

== Ethical works ==
* &quot;Ha-Roḳeaḥ,&quot; (&quot;The Perfumer&quot;), a halachic guide to ethics and Jewish Law for the common reader.

In addition to these works, Eleazar wrote tosafot to many Talmudical treatises, referred to by Bezalel Ashkenazi in his &quot;Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet&quot;; a commentary on &quot;Sheḳalim&quot; in the Jerusalem Talmud, cited by Asheri in his commentary to that treatise in the Babylonian Talmud; thirty-six chapters on the examination of slaughtered animals (MS.

<doc id="633411" wikidata="Q494985" url="?curid=633411" title="The Avengers (1998 film)">
<text>The Avengers is a 1998 American satirical spy action comedy film directed by Jeremiah Chechik, an adaptation of the 1961–1969 British television series of the same name. It stars Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman as secret agents John Steed and Emma Peel, and Sean Connery as Sir August de Wynter, a mad scientist bent on controlling the world&#x27;s weather. Patrick Macnee, Steed in the original series, makes a vocal cameo as the voice of Invisible Jones.

The film underperformed at the box-office, only grossing $54.7 million against its $60 million budget and was met with negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Secret agent John Steed and meteorologist Dr. Emma Peel are summoned to The Ministry. They meet the spymaster, codenamed Mother, who informs them that the Prospero project — an attempt to influence the weather — was apparently sabotaged by Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother&#x27;s second-in-command, Father, claims that Peel suffers from dissociative identity disorder. The duo visits Sir August de Wynter, a former Ministry scientist. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather.

Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather, a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine, where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organization, led by de Wynter, all don teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears.

Steed and Emma go off to visit de Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. An elderly Ministry agent, Alice, helps them to flee; nevertheless, de Wynter captures, drugs, and hypnotizes Emma. When de Wynter is later distracted, Emma tries to escape but feels faint and finds herself trapped due to the mansion&#x27;s ever-changing floor plan. Becoming desperate, she smashes her way through the wall where Steed then finds her unconscious and rescues her. Back at Steed&#x27;s apartment, Emma wakes up and is fired by Steed. However, Emma is arrested by Father, while Steed visits Invisible Jones, a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map found at Wonderland Weather.

After viewing photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working alongside de Wynter. Father and the Emma clone gas Peel unconscious but are confronted by Mother, whom they incapacitate. De Wynter, controlling the weather using Prospero, confronts the world leaders, boasting that he controls the weather and they will have to buy the weather from him at great expense. He gives them a midnight ultimatum.

Father and the clone take Peel to a hot air balloon, where she regains consciousness and escapes during a snowstorm. Father and the clone perish when the balloon collides with the Wonderland Weather sign. Once reunited, Steed and Peel share a kiss. Jones determines de Wynter is using the Prospero instruments on a secret island, and Peel and Steed travel there to stop him. Peel defuses the Prospero device just as a hurricane forms over London. Steed duels de Wynter and impales him with his own cane, causing de Wynter to be disintegrated by a powerful bolt of lightning. The duo escapes just as the base self-destructs, and rendezvous with Mother on the roof of a building.

==Release==
Warner Bros., the film&#x27;s distributor, refused to allow any early press screenings for movie reviewers. Such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998, but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the &quot;dumping ground&quot; for films that are not felt to be strong enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: There&#x27;s...some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there&#x27;s some mention of the word &quot;cloning&quot;. Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn&#x27;t just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn&#x27;t help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes &quot;The Avengers&quot; a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There&#x27;s never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don&#x27;t know. Next, they&#x27;re in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don&#x27;t know how she got there. I must have blinked.

Due to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 89 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which Mrs. Peel&#x27;s evil clone infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words &quot;How now brown cow&quot; in a false telephone box to gain admittance; these words are later used in the film when Steed and Peel use them to enter de Wynter&#x27;s island fortress in another telephone box. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however, he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director&#x27;s cut or special edition in any form, despite the fact that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free.

The rock band Radiohead recorded a version of their song &quot;Man of War&quot; for the &quot;Avengers&quot; soundtrack but abandoned it after a failed studio session.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Avengers&quot; ranked third in its opening weekend behind &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot;, with $10,305,957. It ultimately grossed $23,384,939 in the United States and Canada and $31.3 million internationally for a worldwide total of $54.7 million. (The-Numbers.com reported a lower international gross of $25.2 million.) With a $60 million budget, it was a box office flop.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes shows a 5% score, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 3.20/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, &quot;The Avengers&quot; is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster.&quot; Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 12 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Fans disliked the film for its disrespect to the series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel — previously a carefully ambiguous subject). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the &quot;New York Post&quot; called the film &quot;a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher&quot;, referring to the previous summer&#x27;s likewise poorly received &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, also starring Thurman. David Bianculli stated: &quot;This &quot;Avengers&quot; film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like &quot;Ishtar&quot; and &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; a good name.&quot; Jay Boyer in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said &quot;&quot;The Avengers&quot; is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer&quot;. Reception in Britain was equally hostile. &quot;The Birmingham Post&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;The Avengers&quot; is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews&quot;. Alan Jones in &quot;The Radio Times&quot; said &quot;the cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that&#x27;s stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone&#x27;s time and energy&quot;.

Several critics noted that despite the film being written by Englishman Don Macpherson, the American production team fatally misunderstood the symbols of &quot;Britishness&quot; central to &quot;The Avengers&quot; series, such as the inclusion of an inexplicable gadget on the dashboard of Steed&#x27;s Bentley, which appeared to dispense tea, with milk already added.

Commenting on the truncated released cut, &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s Janet Maslin noted: &quot;At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, &quot;The Avengers&quot; is short but not short enough&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted Fiennes and Thurman in &quot;The Avengers&quot; as &quot;The Worst Movie Double Act Of All Time&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;The Avengers&quot; was nominated for nine Razzies at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards: Picture, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Connery), Actress (Thurman), Actor (Fiennes), Screen Couple (Fiennes and Thurman) and Original Song (&quot;Storm&quot;), winning only one for Worst Remake or Sequel.

== Novelization ==
The film&#x27;s original script was used for its novelization (written by Julie Kaewert) and included all the material which was first shot and then removed from the film.

<doc id="633419" wikidata="Q2672117" url="?curid=633419" title="Sivaya Subramuniyaswami">
<text>Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (born Robert Hansen; January 5, 1927 – November 12, 2001) was an American Hindu religious leader known as Gurudeva by his followers. Subramuniyaswami was born in Oakland, California and adopted Hinduism as a young man. He was the 162nd head of the self claimed Nandinatha Sampradaya&#x27;s Kailasa Parampara and Guru at Kauai&#x27;s Hindu Monastery which is a temple-monastery complex on Hawaii&#x27;s Garden Island.

In 1947, at the age of 20, he journeyed to India and Sri Lanka and in 1949, was initiated into sannyasa by the renowned siddha yogi and worshiper of Lord Shiva, Jnanaguru Yogaswami of Jaffna, Sri Lanka who was regarded as one of the 20th century&#x27;s remarkable mystics. In the 1970s he established a Hindu monastery in Kauai, Hawaii and founded the magazine &quot;Hinduism Today&quot;. In 1985, he created the festival of Pancha Ganapati as a Hindu alternative to December holidays like Christmas. He was one of Shaivism&#x27;s Gurus, the founder and leader of the Saiva Siddhanta Church.

He is part of the guru lineage of the Sri Lankan Alaveddy Hindus. His various institutions form a Jaffna-Tamil-based organization which has branched out from his Sri Subramuniya Ashram in Alaveddy to meet the needs of the growing Hindu diaspora of this century. He also established a monastery in Mauritius, which includes a public Spiritual Park called &quot;Spiritual Park- Pointe de Lascars&quot;. He oversaw more than 50 independent temples worldwide.

His influence reflected the reach of his publications, including the approximately 30 books he wrote. Subramuniyaswami was described by Klaus Klostermaier as &quot;the single-most advocate of Hinduism outside India&quot;. The book &quot;Religious Leaders of America&quot; explained Subramuniyaswami&#x27;s role as &quot;a pillar of orthodox Hinduism.&quot;

==Biography==

=== Youth in California (1927–1946) ===
Sivaya Subramuniyaswami was born in Oakland, California on January 5, 1927 as Robert Hansen. He is quoted as relating how, at the age of six, &quot;the totality of the power of the eternity of the moment began to become stronger and stronger within me from that time onward.&quot; He was most inspired by the life of Swami Vivekananda and his four small volumes: &quot;Raja Yoga&quot;, &quot;Bhakti Yoga&quot;, &quot;Karma Yoga&quot; and &quot;Inspired Talks&quot;, and most particularly by Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Song of the Sannyasin.&quot;

Sivaya Subramuniyaswami&#x27;s training in classical Eastern and Western dance and in the disciplines of yoga developed him into a dancer. He joined the San Francisco Ballet Company, becoming their danseur by the age of nineteen. At twenty years of age, he took the first ship to leave for India after World War II. He celebrated his twenty-first birthday just days before going ashore and walking through the grand Gateway to India in Mumbai.

===Visit to Sri Lanka (1947–1949)===
Sivaya Subramuniyaswami spent almost three years on the island of Ceylon, now called Sri Lanka. Before meeting his guru, he studied with his fourth &quot;catalyst&quot; for a year and a half. Sivaya Subramuniyaswami just wanted to meditate, but his teacher made him work to help village people with reconstructing rural areas. Sivaya Subramuniyaswami visited and lived in many Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka. He was received by the monks there and saw how they lived and dressed. This experience influenced in a very strict way the monastic protocols that he later put into action in his own monastic order.

In the caves of Jalani, Kurugala Balandha, Sri Lanka, he fasted and meditated until he experienced what he felt to be enlightenment. Sivaya Subramuniyaswami relates his feelings while returning to Colombo, Sri Lanka: &quot;Returning back to the city, nothing looked the same anymore. I was in another dimension. Everything was different. I had lost something: the desire for the realization of the Self. I felt complete. I felt alone.&quot;

Back in Colombo, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami met his final teacher before meeting his guru. One day, his teacher arranged a meeting between Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and his long-awaited satguru, Sage Yogaswami. After a deep and inner meeting, Yogaswami gave him the name Subramuniya, an epithet of Sri Murugan. &quot;Subra&quot; means &#x27;the light that emanates out from the central source&#x27;; &quot;muni&quot; means a silent teacher, and &quot;ya&quot; means &#x27;restraint&#x27;.&quot; Subramuniya&quot; means a self-restrained soul who remains silent or speaks out from intuition. After a few visits, Jnanaguru Yogaswami initiated Subramuniya into sannyasa and ordained him into his lineage with a slap on the back giving the following instructions: &quot;This sound will be heard in America! Now go &#x27;round the world and roar like a lion. You will build palaces (temples) and feed thousands.&quot; This event was witnesses by several Jaffna area devotees, notably a local magistrate named Thiru S. Subramaniam.

Yogaswami continued to communicate with Sivaya Subramuniyaswami through Kandiah Chettiar until his death in 1964. In the line of successorship, Subramuniya was considered the 162nd &quot;Jagadacharya&quot; of the &quot;Nandinatha Sampradaya&#x27;s Kailasa Parampara&quot;.

===San Francisco (1949–1970)===
In late 1949 Subramuniya sailed back to America and embarked on seven years of ardent, solitary yoga and meditation In 1956, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami said, he had a tremendous spiritual experience in Denver, Colorado, where &quot;the soul body would finally fully inhabit the physical body&quot;. The following year, in San Francisco, Subramuniya founded what is now Himalayan Academy and opened America&#x27;s first Hindu temple at 3575 Sacramento Street, near Presidio Park. In Switzerland, 1968, he wrote of Shum, a mystical language of meditation that names and maps inner areas of consciousness.

===Subramuniya in the 1950s and 1960s===
The biographies of Subramuniya show a time of transition between 1950 and 1957. Subramuniya states that he was ordered not to teach until he turned thirty in January 1957. He spent some of these seven years traveling around the United States, teaching hatha yoga classes and exploring various non-traditional religions, such as Christian Science, Theosophy, and the science of the mind, the closest Western religions to Hindu thought. His shift to a teaching ministry as Master Subramuniya in 1957 blends elements of these religious movements with Hindu yogic and Vedanta teachings in a language oriented toward his followers at the time, who were Westerners.
Subramuniya in the 1950s and 1960s might be placed in an American metaphysical lineage that can be traced from 19th century Theosophy to the New Age Movement in the late 1970s.

Accordingly, Subramuniya&#x27;s early publications, &quot;The Self-God&quot; (1959), &quot;Cognizantibility&quot; (1958), &quot;Gems of Cognition&quot; (1958) and &quot;Clear White Light&quot; (1968) do not mention Saiva Siddhanta, Hinduism, Shiva, his guru or lineage or his avocation of temple worship so prominently found in his later works. All of Subramuniya&#x27;s early works stress meditation, an advaita based monism and yoga.

Subramuniya also experimented with combining aspects of Hinduism with Christianity in another context. He opened two centers in San Francisco in 1957: one Hindu, the Subramuniya Yoga Order, and the other a Hindu/Christian hybrid, the Christian Yoga Church. A typical Sunday worship at the Christian Yoga Church included the singing of Christian hymns, readings from the New Testament and the Bhagavad Gita or Upanishads and a sermon related to Christian or Hindu mysticism. In this context, Master Subramuniya was known as Father Subramuniya.

===Kauai (1970–2001)===
Sivaya Subramuniyaswami moved his ashram to Kauai in 1970, establishing Kauai Aadheenam, on a riverbank near the foot of an extinct volcano. Also known as Kauai&#x27;s Hindu Monastery, Kauai Aadheenam is a temple-monastery complex on Hawaii&#x27;s Garden Island. In 1979 he published the Holy Orders of Sannyas, defining the ideals, vows and aspirations of Hindu monasticism. In 1979 he founded the Hinduism Today magazine, and in the early 80s, after his world tours, focused his magazine on uniting all Hindus, regardless of nationality or sect, and inspiring and educating seekers everywhere. In Sri Lanka, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami formally took possession of the main building of his Sri Subramuniya Ashram in Alaveddy, founded in 1949.

In 1986 Sivaya Subramuniyaswami founded a branch monastery in Mauritius in response to the government&#x27;s request that he come there &quot;to revive a languishing Hindu faith.&quot; In 1991 he produced the Nandinatha Sutras, 365 aphorisms that outlines the path of virtuous Hindu living. Especially in the early 1990s he campaigned for fair treatment of temple priests, particularly that they should receive the same respect enjoyed by the clergy of other religions. In 2000, he translated the first two books of the Kural into English and also published &quot;How to Become a Hindu&quot;, showing the way for seekers to formally enter the faith, confuting the notion that &quot;You must be born a Hindu to be a Hindu.&quot; In November of that year, he launched Hindu Press International (HPI), a free daily news summary for breaking news sent via e-mail and posted on the web. In 2001, he completed the 3,000-page Master Course trilogy of &quot;Dancing with Siva&quot;, &quot;Living with Siva&quot;, and &quot;Merging with Siva&quot; – volumes of daily lessons on Hindu philosophy, culture and yoga, respectively.

=== Death ===
Learning on October 9, 2001, that he had advanced, metastasized intestinal cancer, confirmed by a host of specialists in three states, all concurring that even the most aggressive treatment regimens would not prove effective, he declined any treatment beyond palliative measures and decided to follow the Indian yogic practice, known as &quot;prayopavesha&quot; in Sanskrit scripture, to abstain from nourishment and take water only from that day on. He died on the 32nd day of his self-declared fast at 11:54 pm on November 12, 2001, surrounded by his twenty-three monastics.

==Spiritual lineage==
He followed the shaivism sect (Shaiva Siddhanta) of Hinduism. He belongs to Nandinatha Sampradaya&#x27;s Kailasa Parampara. Saiva siddhanta is prevalent in South India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia.

Spiritual lineage : Maharishi Nandinath → Sundaranandar, Siddhar who later becomes Tirumular → → → Kadaitswami → Chellapaswami → Siva Yogaswami → Sivaya Subramuniyaswami → Bodhinatha Veylanswami

<doc id="633421" wikidata="Q128605875" url="?curid=633421" title="Mahanaim">
<text>Mahanaim ( &quot;Maḥănayīm&quot;, &quot;camps&quot;) is a place mentioned a number of times by the Bible said to be near Jabbok, in the same general area as Jabesh-gilead, beyond the Jordan River. Although two possible sites have been identified, the precise location of Mahanaim is uncertain. Tell edh-Dhahab el-Gharbi, the western one of the twin Tulul adh-Dhahab tells, is one proposed identification. 

==Biblical narrative==
In the Biblical narrative, the first mentioned of Mahanaim occurs in the Book of Genesis as the place where Jacob, returning from Padan-aram to southern Canaan, had a vision of angels (). Believing it to be &quot;God&#x27;s camp&quot;, Jacob names the place Mahanaim (Hebrew for &quot;Two Camps&quot;, or &quot;Two Companies&quot;) to memorialize the occasion of his own company sharing the place with God&#x27;s. Later in the story, Jacob is moved by fear at the approach of his brother Esau (whom he has reason to fear) and as a result divided his retinue into &quot;two hosts&quot; (two companies), hence the town built on the site took &quot;two hosts&quot; as its name. 

According to the Book of Joshua and 1 Chronicles it became a Levitical city (, ; cf. ), having been located at the southern boundary of Bashan until the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites (). 

In the Biblical narrative, around the start of the &quot;United Monarchy&quot;, the city was a stronghold that had been adapted to serve as a sanctuary for important fugitives (2 Samuel 18:2); the narrative states that after King Saul died, Abner, the commander of Saul’s army, established Saul’s son, Ish-bosheth, in Mahanaim as king of Israel (2 Samuel 2:8). 

Mahanaim is the location to which David is described as fleeing while at war with his son Absalom; having arrived at Mahanaim (2 Samuel 17:24), David is described as having sheltered with a man named Barzillai, and having mustered forces there to combat Absalom&#x27;s army. It is also the location that the Bible states was the place where David was informed about his victory over Absalom, and the death of his son.

The &quot;dance of Mahanaim&quot; is mentioned in Song of Songs 6:13.

==Historical analysis==
According to Gaston Maspero (&quot;The Struggle of the Nations&quot;, p. 773), Mahanaim was among the cities plundered by Shishak during his invasion (1 Kings 14:25) of Israelitish territory, also Champollion, Rosellini and Budge share his view identifying Ma&#x27;hanema&#x27; with Mahanaim. There is no subsequent reference to the city in the annals, and it is not improbable that a vigorous resistance to Shishak or to some other invader brought about its utter demolition.

<text>Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is a molecular modelling and visualization computer program. VMD is developed mainly as a tool to view and analyze the results of molecular dynamics simulations. It also includes tools for working with volumetric data, sequence data, and arbitrary graphics objects. Molecular scenes can be exported to external rendering tools such as POV-Ray, RenderMan, Tachyon, Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), and many others. Users can run their own Tcl and Python scripts within VMD as it includes embedded Tcl and Python interpreters. VMD runs on Unix, Apple Mac macOS, and Microsoft Windows. VMD is available to non-commercial users under a distribution-specific license which permits both use of the program and modification of its source code, at no charge.

== History ==
VMD has been developed under the aegis of principal investigator Klaus Schulten in the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics group at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. A precursor program, called VRChem, was developed in 1992 by Mike Krogh, William Humphrey, and Rick Kufrin. The initial version of VMD was written by William Humphrey, Andrew Dalke, Ken Hamer, Jon Leech, and James Phillips. It was released in 1995. The earliest versions of VMD were developed for Silicon Graphics workstations and could also run in a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE) and communicate with a Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) simulation. VMD was further developed by A. Dalke, W. Humphrey, J. Ulrich in 1995–1996, followed by Sergei Izrailev and J. Stone during 1997–1998. In 1998, John Stone became the main VMD developer, porting VMD to many other Unix operating systems and completing the first full-featured OpenGL version. The first version of VMD for the Microsoft Windows platform was released in 1999. In 2001, Justin Gullingsrud, and Paul Grayson, and John Stone added support for haptic feedback devices and further developing the interface between VMD and NAMD for performing interactive molecular dynamics simulations. In subsequent developments, Jordi Cohen, Gullingsrud, and Stone entirely rewrote the graphical user interfaces, added built-in support for display and processing of volumetric data, and the use of OpenGL Shading Language.

== Interprocess communication ==
VMD can communicate with other programs via Tcl/Tk. This communication allows the development of several external plugins that works together with VMD. These plugins increases the set of features and tools of VMD making it one of the most used software in computational chemistry, biology, and biochemistry.

Here is a list of some VMD plugins developed using Tcl/Tk:
* Delphi Force — electrostatic force calculation and visualization
* Pathways Plugin — identify dominant electron transfer pathways and estimate donor-to-acceptor electronic tunneling
* Check Sidechains Plugin — checks and helps select best orientation and protonation state for Asn, Gln, and His side chains
* MultiMSMS Plugin — caches MSMS calculations to speedup the animation of a sequence of frames
* Interactive Essential Dynamics — Interactive visualization of essential dynamics
* Mead Ionize — Improved version of autoionize for highly charged systems
* Andriy Anishkin&#x27;s VMD Scripts — Many useful VMD scripts for visualization and analysis
* RMSD Trajectory Tool — Development version of RMSD plugin for trajectories
* Clustering Tool — Visualize clusters of conformations of a structure
* iTrajComp — interactive Trajectory Comparison tool
* Swap — Atomic coordinate swapping for improved RMSD alignment
* Intervor — Protein-Protein interface extraction and display
* SurfVol — Measure surface area and volume of proteins
* vmdICE — Plugin for computing RMSD, RMSF, SASA, and other time-varying quantities
* molUP - A VMD plugin to handle QM and ONIOM calculations using the gaussian software
* VMD Store - A VMD extensions that helps users to discover, install, and update other VMD plugins.

<doc id="633437" wikidata="Q4781900" url="?curid=633437" title="Tornado outbreak of April 6–9, 1998">
<text>The tornado outbreak of April 6–9, 1998 was a large tornado outbreak that started on April 6 across the Great Plains and ended on April 9 across the Carolinas and Georgia. A total of 62 tornadoes touched down from the Middle Atlantic States to the Midwestern United States and Texas. The outbreak is infamous for producing a deadly F5 that tore through the suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama, killing 32 people. The Birmingham tornado was one of only two F5 tornadoes that year. The other hit in Lawrence County, Tennessee, on April 16, as part of the same outbreak as the Nashville F3 tornado. This tornado outbreak was responsible for 41 deaths: 7 in Georgia and 34 in Alabama.

==Confirmed tornadoes==
===April 6 event===
===April 7 event===
===April 8 event===
===April 9 event===
===Birmingham, Alabama===

Shortly after 7:30 p.m. on April 8, the outbreak&#x27;s deadliest tornado cut a , swath through multiple Birmingham suburbs, producing damage ranging from F3 to F5 and causing massive destruction before lifting in the western limits of the City of Birmingham, just northwest of the junctions of Interstates 20, 59 and 65. The worst of the destruction occurred across the cities of Oak Grove, Rock Creek, and McDonald Chapel. The second area affected by F5 damage was also devastated by a violent tornado in 1956 that tracked through the same areas hit by this storm. Debris from the tornado was scattered across central Alabama as far north as sections of Blount County, and extensive deforestation occurred along the majority of the path.

The tornado began in rural Tuscaloosa County, only causing F0 damage there. The tornado reached F1 intensity after it entered Jefferson County, and then rapidly intensified to an F3 as it crossed a stray outflow boundary, slamming into Oak Grove, an unincorporated town west of Rock Creek. Oak Grove was one of the hardest hit locations, with many structures destroyed in the area. Oak Grove High School sustained major structural damage, and the elementary school portion was destroyed. The school building was rebuilt two years later and reopened a mile away from the damaged area. No one inside the school was killed, but a group of cheerleaders practicing at the school&#x27;s gymnasium escaped disaster with only minor injuries when a wall prevented a portion of the roof from falling on them. The tornado caused its first three fatalities in Oak Grove, which occurred when a mobile home completely disintegrated, throwing the occupants across the street; of the four occupants, only one survived. The Oak Grove fire station was severely damaged as well.

The tornado continued to intensify dramatically as it moved northeast across the outflow boundary, reaching F5 intensity as it struck Rock Creek. Many homes in the town were leveled or swept completely away, and the roof of Rock Creek Church of God&#x27;s Family Life Center was blown off. Many church attendees were sheltering in the restroom when the building was destroyed; all were safe. Several cars in the church parking lot were thrown into a 50-foot deep ravine. The church was turned into a makeshift trauma center immediately after the tornado. A total of eleven people were killed in Rock Creek. The far western fringes of Concord were impacted in this area as well (particularly the Warrior River Road area). The tornado weakened slightly to F4 intensity as it struck the neighboring community of Sylvan Springs, where many additional homes were completely leveled, and four people were killed. Homes were damaged and destroyed just outside Pleasant Grove as well.

Continuing past Pleasant Grove, the tornado began to encroach on Birmingham&#x27;s inner suburbs. This tornado regained its maximum F5 strength as it tore through the communities of Edgewater and McDonald Chapel. Fourteen people lost their lives there and the storm swept away numerous homes. The tornado&#x27;s effects were noticed around the same time by the &quot;ABC 33/40&quot; Birmingham tower camera, which was pointed toward the western suburbs. Even though it was dark, a massive power failure occurred in western Birmingham, when several transmission lines coming from the Miller Steam Plant electric generating station were knocked off line. This was noticed during the long-form weather coverage on &quot;ABC 33/40&quot;, which lasted most of the evening; the station, and several of its competitors, has a policy of pre-empting regular programming and broadcasting only severe weather information when a tornado warning is in effect for any part of its coverage area. The storm began to separate from the outflow boundary and began to weaken somewhat as it crossed Alabama State Route 269 into the northern Birmingham neighborhood of Pratt City, though it was still very powerful. F3 damage and several injuries occurred in Pratt City before the tornado abruptly dissipated. Had the tornado remained on the ground, it would have gone into the northern sections of downtown Birmingham. A few miles further to the east, the Birmingham International Airport could have been affected as well. The storm lifted before reaching these sections of Birmingham. However, a new F2 tornado touched down again in neighboring St. Clair County, where two people were killed.

The tornado was at the time the seventh deadliest in Alabama history, killing one more person than in a tornado that hit Alabama on March 21, 1932; a young boy died nine days after this event from head injuries. His father was paralyzed from the waist down, and his mother suffered severe injuries. Another mother and her two children, despite taking shelter in their underground basement, were killed when hundreds of pounds of debris was blown onto them. Overall, 32 people were killed by the tornado and hundreds more were injured.
===Dunwoody, Georgia===

After producing three F2+ tornadoes in Alabama, the Birmingham supercell moved into Georgia, producing another F2 in Cobb County. After that tornado lifted, this tornado, also rated F2, touched down at 12:35 a.m. on April 9, just northeast of Perimeter Center in DeKalb County. After sparing the many high-rises there, the tornado rapidly intensified to high-end F2 strength with winds, and grew to wide. It damaged thousands of homes and downed tens of thousands of native pine and hardwood forest trees. Hundreds of homes had major damage, a few dozen were destroyed (or nearly so) and were condemned, having to be completely rebuilt. The campus of DeKalb College (now Perimeter College at Georgia State University) sustained heavy damage. One person was killed in DeKalb County.
The storm continued into Gwinnett County, somewhat weakened, but still causing extensive damage in Peachtree Corners. The tornado crossed the county line west of Norcross, skirting downtown and traveling parallel to Old Norcross Road at F2 status. It continued to Duluth, crossing the center of town and lifting briefly, taking shingles off the roofs of houses in downtown Duluth. Many more trees were snapped along Old Peachtree Road near Interstate 85. The tornado finally weakened and lifted north of Lawrenceville, having affected over 5,000 homes along its path and injured ten people in Gwinnett County. The total length of the tornado&#x27;s path was . The current Norcross High School sits on land deforested by the tornado, and then purchased by the Gwinnett school board. In 2007, the county began seeking a grant from GEMA to help it reinstate a system of tornado sirens, beginning with 11 to be installed along the path of the 1998 tornado.

<text>The Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia () is the fundamental law of the Republic of Slovenia.

==Writing and amendments==
Preparation of the document began in August 1987 in the Slovene Writers&#x27; Association which published an informal draft, and after the DEMOS coalition won the majority in the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia in April 1990, continued in the Assembly. The large part of the work was completed at Podvin Castle near Radovljica in August 1990 under the leadership of the lawyer Peter Jambrek. The Constitution was adopted by the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia on 23 December 1991.

Since its proclamation, the Constitution has been amended seven times, with four major amendments:
* In July 1997, the &quot;Spanish compromise&quot; legalised selling of real estate to foreigners as part of the convergence with the European Union.
* In July 2000, the proportional voting system was entered directly in constitution to avoid legal gap that threatened to happen after the National Assembly didn&#x27;t approve the law about this issue according to somewhat unclear referendum results: three voting systems were proposed to people but none of them won the absolute majority of voters. In a disputed decision, the Constitutional Court of Slovenia ruled that if any law is to be passed, it is to be the law according to the option that got relative majority. In the political events that followed the time was running out and changing the constitution seemed like a good escape from status quo.
* In March 2003, the constitutional amendment was passed that enabled for the transmission of certain legal powers to international organisations. This would allow Slovenia to enter the European Union and NATO if it be the will of the people. A referendum on such was held on 23 March 2003.
* In June 2006, three articles of the constitution were amended to clarify the definition of Public Authority, to clarify transfer of state functions to municipal authorities, and to clarify how regions are established and authorized to carry out state functions. , these have not yet been established.

<text>The Tale of One Bad Rat is a 4-issue comic book limited series by Bryan Talbot. It was first published by Dark Horse Comics in 1994 and later brought out in a collected edition.

The story is about a victim of child abuse. It makes heavy reference to the works of Beatrix Potter.

&quot;One Bad Rat&quot; is the most mainstream of Talbot&#x27;s works and is drawn in a simple, naturalistic style with painted colours. Unusually for Talbot (and the comics industry in general), all of the characters were drawn from life, and the locations from photographs of real places.

==Plot synopsis==
Although it was first published in four comic books, &quot;The Tale of One Bad Rat&quot; is divided into three sections. Its heroine is called Helen Potter; Helen was Beatrix Potter&#x27;s first name.

In the first chapter, &quot;Town&quot;, Helen Potter is a teenage runaway begging on the streets of London with only her pet rat and her Beatrix Potter books for company, and contemplating suicide. In flashback we learn that she has fled her uncaring mother and sexually abusive father. She is also a talented artist. She moves into a squat with some young men who save her from the unwanted attentions of a man (who turns out to be a Conservative MP) by mugging him. When she is later spotted by the MP, she is forced to flee from the police. She returns to the squat to find that her rat has been killed by the squatters&#x27; cat, and leaves to hitchhike north.

&quot;Road&quot; sees Helen making her way north towards the Lake District, drawn by its connection with Beatrix Potter, and accompanied by a giant vision of her rat. There are further flashbacks to the crisis that made her flee her family home. Eventually, in deep countryside, a driver makes a pass at her. She fights him off with such ferocity that he crashes the car. Helen flees into the evening, eventually passing out outside a mysterious building.

In &quot;Country&quot; it is revealed that Helen collapsed outside a country pub and has been taken on as a waitress there. Walking in the hills (still with her giant imaginary rat) and reading self-help books helps her to heal her wounds and prepares her to face her parents. She confronts her father and tells her parents she wants to stay in the Lake District. Finally she visits Hill Top, Beatrix Potter&#x27;s home, and imagines finding a lost Potter book - &quot;The Tale of One Bad Rat&quot; - whose story echoes her own and gives a happy ending. The chapter, and series, ends with Helen sitting sketching a dramatic view over Buttermere and Crummock Water.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into an individual volume:

*&quot;The Tale of One Bad Rat&quot; (136 pages, softcover, Dark Horse, October 1995, , Titan Books, January 1996, , hardcover, Dark Horse, April 1997, , Jonathan Cape, August 2008, )

==Awards==
The &quot;Tale of One Bad Rat&quot; won the 1995 UK Comic Art Award for Best New Publication and the 1995 Don Thompson Award for Best Limited Series. The collected edition won the Eisner Award for best Graphic Album Reprint in 1996, and received several other awards and nominations, including a nomination for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 1997.

<doc id="633457" wikidata="Q7801855" url="?curid=633457" title="Tik-Tok (Oz)">
<text>Tik-Tok is a fictional &quot;mechanical man&quot; from the Oz books by American author L. Frank Baum. He has been termed &quot;the prototype robot&quot;, and is widely considered to be one of the first robots to appear in modern literature, though the term &quot;Robot&quot; was not used until the 1920s, in the play &quot;R.U.R.&quot;

==Baum&#x27;s character==
Tik-Tok (sometimes spelled Tiktok) is a round-bodied mechanical man made of copper, who runs on clockwork springs which periodically need to be wound, like a wind-up toy or a mechanical clock. He has separate windings for thought, action, and speech. Tik-Tok is unable to wind any of them up himself. When his works run down, he becomes frozen or mute. For one memorable moment in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, he continues to speak but utters gibberish. When he speaks, only his teeth move. His knees and elbows are described as resembling those in a knight&#x27;s suit of armor. Being a machine, he is quite strong, allowing him to single-handedly overpower a whole horde of Wheelers without much difficulty, as demonstrated in a scene of the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;.

As Baum repeatedly mentions, Tik-Tok is not alive and feels no emotions. He therefore can no more love or be loved than a sewing machine, but as a servant he is utterly truthful and loyal. He describes himself as a &quot;slave&quot; to Dorothy and defers to her.

Tik-Tok was invented by Smith &amp; Tinker at their workshop in Evna. He was the only model of his kind made before the two disappeared. He was purchased by the king of Ev, Evoldo, who gave him the name Tik-Tok because of the sound he made when wound. The cruel king also whipped his mechanical servant, but his whippings caused no pain and merely kept Tik-Tok&#x27;s round copper body polished.

===Appearances in the works of Baum===

Tik-Tok first appears in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907) where Dorothy Gale discovers him locked up in a cave, wound down and immobile. He becomes Dorothy&#x27;s servant and protector, and, despite his tendency to run down at crucial moments, helps to subdue the Nome King. That novel also introduces Tik-Tok&#x27;s monotonic, halting mode of speech: &quot;Good morn-ing, lit-tle girl.&quot;

Later Baum published &quot;Tik-Tok and the Nome King,&quot; a short tale in his &quot;Little Wizard Stories of Oz&quot; series (1914). In this story, Ruggedo the Nome King, angered by Tik-Tok&#x27;s calling him a &quot;fat nome&quot;, smashes him to pieces. Kaliko secretly reassembled Tik-Tok, but does not tell his master. Ruggedo then mistook the rebuilt Tik-Tok for a ghost. Ever after, he was colored whitish-grey in color plates, apparently a mistake.

&quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot; was a stage musical loosely adapted from &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;; and the play was adapted back into a novel called &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;, the eighth Land of Oz book, published on June 19, 1914. Although Tik-Tok is a major character in that latter book, he in no way drives the plot. Tik-Tok also appears in most other Oz novels as a notable inhabitant of the Emerald City, most prominently in &quot;The Scalawagons of Oz&quot;, in which he operates the production of the Scalawagons.

==Appearances in adult fiction==
In the comic book &quot;Oz Squad&quot;, Tik-Tok&#x27;s &quot;Internal Clockwork Morality Spring&quot; winds down and causes him to act violent and sexual, though he closely resembles Neill&#x27;s depiction.

A somewhat sinister version of Tik-Tok is a minor character in Gregory Maguire&#x27;s revisionist Oz novel &quot;&quot;. In the novel, &quot;tiktok&quot; is used as an adjective for any mechanical or robotic being. The character Madame Morrible has a tiktok servant, called Grommetik, whose description matches Baum&#x27;s Tik-Tok; however, this character&#x27;s speech key is never wound. It is strongly implied that this tiktok servant kills Doctor Dillamond, on Madame Morrible&#x27;s orders. Though no great detail is spent on the topic, Grommetik eventually becomes independent, and, possibly due to disgust at the things he was forced to do, tries to foment rebellion among the tik-toks.

In John Sladek&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;Tik-Tok&quot;, a psychopathic robot named Tik-Tok, having overcome his asimov circuits, commits a series of horrific crimes and spreads chaos and bloodshed, later becoming rich and elected Vice-President of the United States.

Gregory Benford&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Fear&quot;, set tens of thousands of years in the future, depicts a group of robots named tik-toks, who are responsible for supervising the automated farms on the planet Trantor. A tik-tok revolt against the forces of the Galactic Empire play a major role in the novel.

==Later works==
Tik-Tok was played by Wallace Illington in the 1908 film, &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot;, which is now known only from a production still or two. In 1913, the comedian James C. Morton played Tik-Tok in &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot;, a musical play by Baum, Louis F. Gottschalk, Victor Schertzinger, and Oliver Morosco. The role of Tik-Tok was a role similar to that of David C. Montgomery&#x27;s Tin Woodman in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Corresponding to Fred Stone&#x27;s Scarecrow or clown part was Shaggy Man, played by Frank F. Moore, who would later play the Scarecrow in &quot;His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz&quot;. Tik-Tok did not appear in any of the productions of The Oz Film Manufacturing Company.

Tik-Tok appeared in the 1980 television special &quot;Thanksgiving in the Land of Oz&quot; voiced by Joan Gerber.

Tik-Tok was a main character in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, adapted from &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; and &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;. His legs are very stout and he speaks with his mustache rather than his teeth. In the film, he is the entire Royal Army of Oz, which is ironic considering his general haplessness, partly from the character&#x27;s in-book inability to wind up his clockworks for himself. In an interview for the Elstree project, director Walter Murch explained that Tik-Tok&#x27;s physical performance was created by the acrobat Michael Sundin: &quot;he would put his legs down into Tik-Tok&#x27;s legs, and then he would bend over looking through his legs, through his thighs, and then he would cross his arms [across his chest] to operate Tik-Tok&#x27;s arms.&quot; He used an LCD feed inside the costume to monitor his movements. Due to the heat and physical exertion of being upside-down, according to Murch, Sundin&#x27;s &quot;limit was two and half minutes from the moment the lid went on.&quot; Sean Barrett provided his voice, while Tim Rose remotely-operated the head.

Tik-Tok appears in the 2017 TV series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; voiced by Jess Harnell. Just like the books, Tik-Tok was created by Smith &amp; Tinker.

==Other appearances==
Tik-Tok&#x27;s design was used in the video game &quot;Epic Mickey 2&quot; as a design for the &quot;Basher&quot; Beetleworx.

<text>The captain of a football/soccer team, sometimes known as the skipper, is a team member chosen to be the on-pitch leader of the team; they are often one of the older or more experienced members of the squad, or a player that can heavily influence a game or has good leadership qualities. The team captain is usually identified by the wearing of an armband. In the 2024/25 edition of the Laws of the Game, it was made mandatory for each team to have a captain and for each captain to be identified by the previously traditional but non-mandatory captain&#x27;s armband.

== Responsibilities ==
The only official responsibility of a captain specified by the Laws of the Game is to participate in the coin toss prior to kick-off (for choice of ends or to have kick-off) and prior to a penalty shoot-out. Contrary to what is sometimes said, captains have no special authority under the Laws to challenge a decision by the referee. However, referees may talk to the captain of a side about the side&#x27;s general behaviour when necessary.

At an award-giving ceremony after a fixture like a cup competition final, the captain usually leads the team up to collect their medals. Any trophy won by a team will be received by the captain, who will also be the first one to hoist it. The captain also generally leads the teams out of the dressing room at the start of the match. A captain is also tasked with running the dressing room.

The captain generally provides a rallying point for the team: if morale is low, it is the captain who will be looked upon to boost their team&#x27;s spirits.

Captains may join the manager in deciding the starting eleven for a certain game. In youth or recreational football, the captain often takes on duties that would, at a higher level, be delegated to the manager.
== Club ==

A &quot;club captain&quot; is usually appointed for a season. If they are unavailable or not selected for a particular game, or must leave the pitch, then the club vice-captain will assume similar duties.

The match captain is the first player to lift a trophy should the team win one, even if they are not the club captain. A good example of this was in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final when match captain Peter Schmeichel lifted the trophy for Manchester United as club captain Roy Keane was suspended. In the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, match captain Frank Lampard (who was the vice-captain) jointly lifted the trophy for Chelsea with club captain John Terry, who was suspended, but given permission by UEFA.

A club may appoint two distinct roles: a club captain to represent the players in a public relations role, and correspondent on the pitch. Manchester United has had both of these types of captains: Roy Keane was the club captain on &quot;and&quot; off the pitch from 1997 to 2005 as he was a regular in the starting eleven, but his successor Gary Neville while nominally club captain from 2005 to 2010 had made few first team appearances due to injuries. In his absence other players (Rio Ferdinand or vice-captain Ryan Giggs) were chosen to captain the team on the field, such as in the 2008 (Ferdinand was captain as he was in the starting eleven, while Giggs was a substitute) and 2009 UEFA Champions League Finals, respectively. After Neville retired in 2011, regular starter Nemanja Vidić was named as club captain.

=== Vice-captain ===

A &quot;vice-captain&quot; (or &quot;assistant captain&quot;) is a player that is expected to captain the side when the club&#x27;s captain is not included in the starting eleven, or if, during a game, the captain is substituted or sent off. Examples include Ronald Araújo at Barcelona, Thomas Müller at Bayern Munich, and Dani Carvajal at Real Madrid.

 Similarly, some clubs also name a &quot;3rd captain&quot;, a &quot;4th captain&quot;, or even a &quot;5th captain&quot; to take the role of captain when both the captain and vice-captain are unavailable. Examples include Frenkie de Jong as a 3rd captain and Raphinha as a 4th captain for Barcelona. In their 2015–16 season, Barcelona Femení had six named captains.

== International ==

In the 1986 FIFA World Cup, when Bryan Robson was injured and vice-captain Ray Wilkins received a two-game suspension for a red card, Peter Shilton became England&#x27;s captain for the rest of the tournament.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Germany had three captains. Michael Ballack had captained the national team since 2004, including the successful qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup, but he did not play in the latter tournament due to a last minute injury. Philipp Lahm was appointed captain in South Africa, but due to an illness that ruled him out of Germany&#x27;s final fixture, Bastian Schweinsteiger captained the team for that game which was the third-place match. Lahm stated in an interview that he would not relinquish the captaincy when Ballack returned, causing some controversy, so team manager Oliver Bierhoff clarified the situation, saying: &quot;Philipp Lahm is the World Cup captain and Michael Ballack is still the captain&quot;. Lahm ended up becoming the permanent captain of Germany until his retirement, as Ballack was never called up in the national team again.

<text>Antihypertensives are a class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure, such as stroke, heart failure, kidney failure and myocardial infarction. Evidence suggests that a reduction of blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34% and of ischaemic heart disease by 21%. It can reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease. There are many classes of antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure by different means. Among the most important and most widely used medications are thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor blockers or antagonists (ARBs), and beta blockers.

Which type of medication to use initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and resulting national guidelines. The fundamental goal of treatment should be the prevention of the important endpoints of hypertension, such as heart attack, stroke and heart failure. Patient age, associated clinical conditions and end-organ damage also play a part in determining dosage and type of medication administered. The several classes of antihypertensives differ in side effect profiles, ability to prevent endpoints, and cost. The choice of more expensive agents, where cheaper ones would be equally effective, may have negative impacts on national healthcare budgets. As of 2018, the best available evidence favors low-dose thiazide diuretics as the first-line treatment of choice for high blood pressure when drugs are necessary. Although clinical evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most people (from both efficacy and cost points of view), an ACEi is recommended by NICE in the UK for those under 55 years old.

==Diuretics==

Diuretics help the kidneys eliminate excess salt and water from the body&#x27;s tissues and blood.
* Loop diuretics:
** bumetanide
** ethacrynic acid
** furosemide
** torsemide
* Thiazide diuretics:
** epitizide
** hydrochlorothiazide and chlorothiazide
** bendroflumethiazide
** methyclothiazide
** polythiazide
* Thiazide-like diuretics:
** indapamide
** chlorthalidone
** metolazone
** xipamide
** clopamide
* Potassium-sparing diuretics:
** amiloride
** triamterene
** spironolactone
** eplerenone

In the United States, the JNC8 (Eighth Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) recommends thiazide-type diuretics to be one of the first-line drug treatments for hypertension, either as monotherapy or in combination with calcium channel blockers, ACEis, or ARBs. There are fixed-dose combination drugs, such as ACE inhibitor and thiazide combinations. Despite thiazides being cheap and effective, they are not prescribed as often as some newer drugs. This is because they have been associated with increased risk of new-onset diabetes and as such are recommended for use in patients over 65, for whom the risk of new-onset diabetes is outweighed by the benefits of controlling systolic blood pressure. Another theory is that they are off-patent and thus rarely promoted by the drug industry. 

Medications that are classified as potassium-sparing diuretics which block the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), such as amiloride and triamterene, are seldom prescribed as monotherapy. ENaC blocker medications need stronger public evidence for their blood pressure reducing effect.

==Calcium channel blockers==
Calcium channel blockers block the entry of calcium into muscle cells in artery walls, resulting in the relaxation of muscle cells and vasodilation.
* dihydropyridines:
** amlodipine
** barnidipine
** cilnidipine
** clevidipine
** felodipine
** isradipine
** lercanidipine
** levamlodipine
** nicardipine
** nifedipine
** nimodipine
** nisoldipine
** nitrendipine
* non-dihydropyridines:
** diltiazem
** verapamil

The 8th Joint National Committee (JNC-8) recommends calcium channel blockers to be a first-line treatment either as monotherapy or in combination with thiazide-type diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs for all patients regardless of age or race.

The ratio of CCBs&#x27; anti-proteinuria effect, non-dihydropyridine to dihydropyridine was 30 to −2. The anti-proteinuria effect of non-dihydropyridine is due to better selectivity during glomerular filtration and/or a lower perfusion rate through the renal system.

Notable side effects of CCBs include edema, flushing in the face, headache, drowsiness, and dizziness.

==ACEis==

ACEis inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.
* captopril
* enalapril
* fosinopril
* lisinopril
* moexipril
* perindopril
* quinapril
* ramipril
* trandolapril
* benazepril
A systematic review of 63 trials with over 35,000 participants indicated ACEis significantly reduced doubling of serum creatinine levels compared to other drugs (ARBs, α blockers, β blockers, etc.), and the authors suggested this as a first line of defense. The AASK trial showed that ACEis are more effective at slowing down the decline of kidney function compared to calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. As such, ACEis should be the drug treatment of choice for patients with chronic kidney disease regardless of race or diabetic status.

However, ACEis (and ARBs) should not be a first-line treatment for black hypertensives without chronic kidney disease. Results from the ALLHAT trial showed that thiazide-type diuretics and calcium channel blockers were both more effective as monotherapy in improving cardiovascular outcomes compared to ACEis for this subgroup. Furthermore, ACEis were less effective in reducing blood pressure and had a 51% higher risk of stroke in black hypertensives when used as initial therapy compared to a calcium channel blocker. There are fixed-dose combination drugs, such as ACE inhibitor and thiazide combinations.

Notable side effects of ACEis include dry cough, high blood levels of potassium, fatigue, dizziness, headaches, loss of taste and a risk for angioedema.

==ARBs==

ARBs work by antagonizing the activation of angiotensin receptors.
* azilsartan
* candesartan
* eprosartan
* irbesartan
* losartan
* olmesartan
* telmisartan
* valsartan
* fimasartan
In 2004, an article in the BMJ examined the evidence for and against the suggestion that ARBs may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack). The matter was debated in 2006 in the medical journal of the American Heart Association. There is no consensus on whether ARBs have a tendency to increase MI, but there is also no substantive evidence to indicate that ARBs are able to reduce MI.

In the VALUE trial, the ARB valsartan produced a statistically significant 19% (p=0.02) relative increase in the prespecified secondary end point of myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal) compared with amlodipine.

The CHARM-alternative trial showed a significant +52% (p=0.025) increase in myocardial infarction with candesartan (versus placebo) despite a reduction in blood pressure.

As a consequence of AT1 blockade, ARBs increase angiotensin II levels several-fold above baseline by uncoupling a negative-feedback loop. Increased levels of circulating angiotensin II result in unopposed stimulation of the AT2 receptors, which are, in addition upregulated. Recent data suggest that AT2 receptor stimulation may be less beneficial than previously proposed and may even be harmful under certain circumstances through mediation of growth promotion, fibrosis, and hypertrophy, as well as proatherogenic and proinflammatory effects.

An ARB happens to be the favorable alternative to an ACEi if a hypertensive patient with the heart-failure type of reduced ejection fraction treated with an ACEi (or ACEis) was intolerant of cough, angioedema other than hyperkalemia or chronic kidney disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACC/AHA/HFSA 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adrenergic receptor antagonists==
Beta-blockers can block beta-1 adrenergic receptors and/or beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Those that block beta-1-adrenergic receptors prevent the binding of endogenous catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine), which ultimately reduces blood pressure through decreasing renin and cardiac output release. Those that block beta-2-adrenergic receptors reduce blood pressure through increased relaxation of smooth muscle. 

Alpha-blockers can block alpha-1 adrenergic receptors and/or alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Those that block alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells prevent vasoconstriction. Blockade of alpha-2-adrenergic receptors prevents the negative feedback mechanism of norepinephrine (NE). Non-selective alpha-blockers generate a balance whereby alpha-2-blockers release NE to reduce the vasodilation effects induced by alpha-1-blockers.
* Beta blockers
** acebutolol
** atenolol
** bisoprolol
** betaxolol
** carteolol
** carvedilol
** labetalol
** metoprolol
** nadolol
** nebivolol
** oxprenolol
** penbutolol
** pindolol
** propranolol
** timolol
* Alpha blockers:
** doxazosin
** chlorpromazine
** phentolamine
** indoramin
** phenoxybenzamine
** prazosin
** terazosin
** tolazoline
** urapidil
* Mixed Alpha + Beta blockers:
** bucindolol
** carvedilol
** labetalol
** clonidine (indirectly)

Although beta blockers lower blood pressure, they do not have a positive benefit on endpoints as some other antihypertensives do. In particular, beta-blockers are no longer recommended as first-line treatment due to relative adverse risk of stroke and new-onset of type 2 diabetes when compared to other medications, while certain specific beta-blockers such as atenolol appear to be less useful in overall treatment of hypertension than several other agents. A systematic review of 63 trials with over 35,000 participants indicated β-blockers increased the risk of mortality, compared to other antihypertensive therapies. They do, however, have an important role in the prevention of heart attacks in people who have already had a heart attack. In the United Kingdom, the June 2006 &quot;Hypertension: Management of Hypertension in Adults in Primary Care&quot; guideline of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, downgraded the role of beta-blockers due to their risk of provoking type 2 diabetes.

Despite lowering blood pressure, alpha blockers have significantly poorer endpoint outcomes than other antihypertensives, and are no longer recommended as a first-line choice in the treatment of hypertension.
However, they may be useful for some men with symptoms of prostate disease.

==Vasodilators==
Vasodilators act directly on the smooth muscle of arteries to relax their walls so blood can move more easily through them; they are only used in hypertensive emergencies or when other drugs have failed, and even so are rarely given alone.

Sodium nitroprusside, a very potent, short-acting vasodilator, is most commonly used for the quick, temporary reduction of blood pressure in emergencies (such as malignant hypertension or aortic dissection). Hydralazine and its derivatives are also used in the treatment of severe hypertension, although they should be avoided in emergencies. They are no longer indicated as first-line therapy for high blood pressure due to side effects and safety concerns, but hydralazine remains a drug of choice in gestational hypertension.

==Renin inhibitors==
Renin comes one level higher than ACE in the renin–angiotensin system. Renin inhibitors can therefore effectively reduce hypertension. Aliskiren (developed by Novartis) is a renin inhibitor which has been approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of hypertension.

==Aldosterone receptor antagonist==
Aldosterone receptor antagonists, also known as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) can lower blood pressure by blocking the binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor. Spironolactone and eplerenone are MRAs that causes a block in the reabsorption of sodium, resulting in a decrease in blood pressure.
* eplerenone
* spironolactone

Aldosterone receptor antagonists are not recommended as first-line agents for blood pressure, but spironolactone and eplerenone are both used in the treatment of heart failure and resistant hypertension.

==Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists==
Central alpha agonists lower blood pressure by stimulating alpha-receptors in the brain which open peripheral arteries easing blood flow. These alpha 2 receptors are known as autoreceptors which provide negative feedback in neurotransmission (in this case, the vasoconstriction effects of adrenaline).
Central alpha agonists, such as clonidine, are usually prescribed when all other anti-hypertensive medications have failed. For treating hypertension, these drugs are usually administered in combination with a diuretic.
* clonidine
* guanabenz
* guanfacine
* methyldopa
* moxonidine

Adverse effects of this class of drugs include sedation, drying of the nasal mucosa and rebound hypertension upon discontinuation.

Some indirect anti-adrenergics are rarely used in treatment-resistant hypertension:
* guanethidine replaces norepinephrine in vesicles, decreasing its tonic release
* mecamylamine antinicotinic and ganglion blocker
* reserpine indirect via irreversible VMAT inhibition

==Endothelium receptor blockers==
Bosentan belongs to a new class of drugs and works by blocking endothelin receptors. It is specifically indicated only for the treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension in patients with moderate to severe heart failure.

==Choice of initial medication==
For mild blood pressure elevation, consensus guidelines call for medically supervised lifestyle changes and observation before recommending initiation of drug therapy. However, according to the American Hypertension Association, evidence of sustained damage to the body may be present even prior to observed elevation of blood pressure. Therefore, the use of hypertensive medications may be started in individuals with apparent normal blood pressures but who show evidence of hypertension-related nephropathy, proteinuria, atherosclerotic vascular disease, as well as other evidence of hypertension-related organ damage.

If lifestyle changes are ineffective, then drug therapy is initiated, often requiring more than one agent to effectively lower hypertension.
Which type of many medications should be used initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and various national guidelines. Considerations include factors such as age, race, and other medical conditions. In the United States, JNC8 (2014) recommends any drug from one of the four following classes to be a good choice as either initial therapy or as an add-on treatment: thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACEis, or ARBs.

The first large study to show a mortality benefit from antihypertensive treatment was the VA-NHLBI study, which found that chlorthalidone was effective. The largest study, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) in 2002, concluded that chlorthalidone (a thiazide-like diuretic) was as effective as lisinopril (an ACEi) or amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker). (ALLHAT showed that doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, had a higher incidence of heart failure events, and the doxazosin arm of the study was stopped.)

A subsequent smaller study (ANBP2) did not show the slight advantages in thiazide diuretic outcomes observed in the ALLHAT study, and actually showed slightly better outcomes for ACEis in older white male patients.

Thiazide diuretics are effective, recommended as the best first-line drug for hypertension, and are much more affordable than other therapies, yet they are not prescribed as often as some newer drugs. Chlorthalidone is the thiazide drug that is most strongly supported by the evidence as providing a mortality benefit; in the ALLHAT study, a chlorthalidone dose of 12.5 mg was used, with titration up to 25 mg for those subjects who did not achieve blood pressure control at 12.5 mg. Chlorthalidone has repeatedly been found to have a stronger effect on lowering blood pressure than hydrochlorothiazide, and hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone have a similar risk of hypokalemia and other adverse effects at the usual doses prescribed in routine clinical practice. Patients with an exaggerated hypokalemic response to a low dose of a thiazide diuretic should be suspected to have hyperaldosteronism, a common cause of secondary hypertension.

Other medications have a role in treating hypertension. Adverse effects of thiazide diuretics include hypercholesterolemia, and impaired glucose tolerance with increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. The thiazide diuretics also deplete circulating potassium unless combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic or supplemental potassium. Some authors have challenged thiazides as first line treatment. However, as the Merck Manual of Geriatrics notes, &quot;thiazide-type diuretics are especially safe and effective in the elderly.&quot;

Current UK guidelines suggest starting patients over the age of 55 years and all those of African/Afrocaribbean ethnicity firstly on calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics, whilst younger patients of other ethnic groups should be started on ACEis. Subsequently, if dual therapy is required to use an ACEi in combination with either a calcium channel blocker or a (thiazide) diuretic. Triple therapy is then of all three groups and should the need arise then to add in a fourth agent, to consider either a further diuretic (e.g. spironolactone or furosemide), an alpha-blocker or a beta-blocker. Prior to the demotion of beta-blockers as first line agents, the UK sequence of combination therapy used the first letter of the drug classes and was known as the &quot;ABCD rule&quot;.

===Patient factors===
The choice between the drugs is to a large degree determined by the characteristics of the patient being prescribed for, the drugs&#x27; side effects, and cost. Most drugs have other uses; sometimes the presence of other symptoms can warrant the use of one particular antihypertensive. Examples include:
* Age can affect the choice of medications. Current UK guidelines suggest starting patients over the age of 55 years first on calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics.
* Age and multi-morbidity can affect the choice of medication, the target blood pressure and even whether to treat or not.
* Anxiety may be improved with the use of beta blockers.
* Asthmatics have been reported to have worsening symptoms when using beta blockers.
* Beta blockers can trigger or worsen psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia may be improved with the use of an alpha blocker.
* Chronic kidney disease. ACEis or ARBs should be included in the treatment plan to improve kidney outcomes regardless of race or diabetic status.
* Late-stage dementia should consider deprescribing antihypertensives, according to the Medication Appropriateness Tool for Comorbid Health Conditions in Dementia (MATCH-D).
* Diabetes mellitus. The ACEis and ARBs have been shown to prevent the kidney and retinal complications of diabetes mellitus.
* Gout may be worsened by thiazide diuretics, while losartan reduces serum urate.
* Kidney stones may be improved with the use of thiazide-type diuretics 
* Heart block. β-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in patients with heart block greater than first degree. JNC8 does not recommend β-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension.
* Heart failure may be worsened with nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, the alpha blocker doxazosin, and the alpha-2 agonists moxonidine and clonidine. On the other hand, β-blockers, diuretics, ACEis, ARBs, and aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown to improve outcome.
* Pregnancy. Although α-methyldopa is generally regarded as a first-line agent, labetalol and metoprolol are also acceptable. Atenolol has been associated with intrauterine growth retardation, as well as decreased placental growth and weight when prescribed during pregnancy. ACEis and ARBs are contraindicated in women who are or who intend to become pregnant.
* Periodontal disease could mitigate the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs.
* Race. JNC8 guidelines particularly point out that when used as monotherapy, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers have been found to be more effective in reducing blood pressure in black hypertensives than β-blockers, ACEis, or ARBs.
* Tremor may warrant the use of beta blockers.
The JNC8 guidelines indicate reasons to choose one drug over the others for certain individual patients.

==Antihypertensive Medication during the First Trimester of Pregnancy==
Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy constitute a significant risk factor for maternal and fetal outcomes, necessitating antihypertensive treatment. However, current data concerning the safety of in utero exposure to antihypertensive medication are controversial. While some studies recommend the administration of certain agents, others underline the possible adverse effects on fetal development. In general, a-methyldopa, β-blockers and calcium channel blockers are the first or second treatment line for hypertension during pregnancy. However, ACEis, ARBs and diuretics are mostly contraindicated, as the potential risk outweighs the benefits of their administration. Additionally, several drugs should be avoided, due to the lack of data regarding their safety. Women are often concerned about the safety of antihypertensives and as a result, many do not take their treatment as prescribed. Shared decision-making aids have been shown to reduce women&#x27;s uncertainty about taking antihypertensives and increase the number of women taking them as prescribed.

==History==
History of Thiazides

Chlorothiazide was discovered in 1957, but the first known instance of an effective antihypertensive treatment was in 1947 using primaquine, an antimalarial.

History of Calcium Channel Blockers

In 1883, Ringer discovered the involvement of calcium for cellular activity on isolated heart. Later in 1901, Stiles reported the same activity in muscle contraction. In the early 1940s, Kamada (from Japan) and Heilbrunn (from the United States) noted how calcium was involved with muscle contractions. In 1964, calcium channel blockers were discovered in Godfraind&#x27;s laboratory through the screening of coronary dilators, which showed how calcium was blocked from entering artery cells, resulting in vasorelaxation.

==Research==

===Blood pressure vaccines===
Vaccinations are being trialed and may become a treatment option for high blood pressure in the future. CYT006-AngQb was only moderately successful in studies, but similar vaccines are being investigated.

Anti-hypertensive drugs in older people

The latest evidence does not have evidence of an effect due to discontinuing vs continuing medications used for treating elevated blood pressure or prevention of heart disease in older adults on all-case mortality and incidence of heart attack. The findings are based on low quality evidence suggesting it may be safe to stop anti-hypertensive medications. However, older adults should not stop any of their medications without talking to a healthcare professional.

<doc id="633468" wikidata="Q733960" url="?curid=633468" title="Cold Case">
<text>Cold Case is an American police procedural crime drama television series. It ran on CBS from September 28, 2003, to May 2, 2010. The series revolved around a fictionalized Philadelphia Police Department division that specializes in investigating cold cases, usually homicides.

==Premise==
The show is set in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it follows Detective Lilly Rush (Kathryn Morris), a homicide detective with the Philadelphia Police Department, who specializes in cold cases, or investigations which are no longer being actively pursued by the department. Rush was initially partnered with Detective Chris Lassing (Justin Chambers) in the first five episodes and then with Detective Scotty Valens (Danny Pino) for the remainder of the series. They work under Lieutenant John Stillman (John Finn) and are assisted by other detectives from their squad—Nick Vera (Jeremy Ratchford), Will Jeffries (Thom Barry), and beginning in season three, Kat Miller (Tracie Thoms).

Usually, each episode would focus on a single investigation. All cases involved murders committed (or bodies found) in Philadelphia, although investigations occasionally required travel outside the city. Cases were also spread out over much of the previous century, with some as recent as a year or two old and others dating back to the 1910s. Generally, an investigation would begin when the police received a new lead, or new direction, on a case.

Over the course of the episode, the detectives would interview witnesses associated with the crime and piece together the story of what led the victims to their death. These interviews were accompanied by flashback sequences to the era of the murder, which dramatized the testimony. Through the flashbacks, the show examined many issues related to 20th century history, including racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, abortion, and police brutality.

The show was distinguished by double casting, in which the characters and witnesses would flash back and forth in the scene representing them as they looked at the time of the crime and in the present day. At the end of the episode, when the killer or killers were exposed and confronted, the confession would be in a flashback scene depicting the murder. The police would be shown arresting the killer and walking them into custody. The victims would sometimes also reappear as fading visions to one of the police officers.

==Music==
The theme song is an excerpt from &quot;Nara&quot; by E.S. Posthumus, with an introduction by series composer Michael A. Levine that begins with an otherworldly wail from vocalist Elise Morris. Besides Levine&#x27;s original music, each episode makes extensive use of era-appropriate music for flashbacks to the year in question. Some episodes contain music only from one artist such as Ray Charles, U2, Bruce Springsteen, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Doors, John Mellencamp, Johnny Cash, Bob Seger, Pink Floyd, Tim McGraw, Bob Dylan, Santana, Frank Sinatra and John Lennon. Pearl Jam&#x27;s music was used in the two-part season-six finale, the first time one artist&#x27;s music has been used for two full episodes.

==Cast and characters==
* Kathryn Morris as Lilly Rush, a Homicide Detective. Lilly first investigates a cold case during episode 1 of the series, and later continues to do so at her own request. In this capacity, Rush becomes the lead detective of the cold case division.
* Justin Chambers as Chris Lassing, a detective. Lilly&#x27;s original partner (Season 1).
* Danny Pino as Scotty Valens, a detective. Lilly&#x27;s second partner.
* John Finn as John Stillman, a lieutenant and the head of Philadelphia Homicide Division. 
* Jeremy Ratchford as Nick Vera, a detective assigned to Homicide. 
* Thom Barry as Will Jeffries, a senior detective, and Philadelphia Homicide Division&#x27;s assistant-supervisor.
* Tracie Thoms as Kat Miller, a narcotics detective who later joins as a homicide detective (Seasons 3–7).

== Fictional universe ==
Danny Pino appeared as Valens in the &quot;&quot; episode “Cold Reveal”. This episode connected &quot;Cold Case&quot; to not only &quot;CSI: NY&quot;, but also to &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Without a Trace&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Japanese adaptation===
A Japanese remake of the series, , set in Yokohama, was broadcast on cable network WOWOW Prime from October 22, 2016, to December 24, 2016. A second season was broadcast from October 13, 2018, to December 15, 2018, and a third season was broadcast from December 5, 2020, to February 13, 2021. The second and third seasons are filmed in 8K and downscaled to 4K for broadcast.

===Russian adaptation===
Company Star Media produced Russian adaptation of the series (broadcast in Russia under the title &quot;Detective Rush&quot;) named &quot;Without Prescription&quot;. The show consists of 25 episodes.

==Satire==
In 2005, John Finn, Kathryn Morris and Jeremy Ratchford appeared in a satirical promo on the Irish-language television station TG4. The commercial won a gold medal in the &quot;Best Drama Promos&quot; category of the 2007 Sharks International Advertising Awards Festival of Ireland (Sharks Awards). The promotion features John Finn and Kathryn Morris in character interrogating a murder suspect (Peader Cox) from the TG4 soap &quot;Ros na Rún&quot; who refuses to speak in English; both detectives then begin talking in Gaelic, much to the surprise of Jeremy Ratchford&#x27;s character. The promo tied in with a murder investigation in &quot;Ros na Rún&quot;.

At the launch of &quot;Cold Case&quot; in July 2003, a Canadian journalist asked the launch panel about similarities between &quot;Cold Case&quot; and a Canadian series called &quot;Cold Squad&quot; which had debuted five years earlier. &quot;Cold Squad&quot; fans accused the American series of copying the Canadian program&#x27;s basic premise and characters. In 2003, the &quot;Cold Squad&quot; creators considered seeking legal redress against the &quot;Cold Case&quot; producers over copyright issues. Both shows aired in Canada (and on the same network, CTV). In November 2003, the law firm O&#x27;Donnell &amp; Schaeffer confirmed it agreed to represent the &quot;Cold Squad&quot; producers, who claimed the CBS series was a copy of their own hit show. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that Meredith Stiehm, the American series creator, attended a TV writing seminar at the Canadian Film Centre in 2002 where the &quot;Cold Squad&quot; concept was discussed. O&#x27;Donnell lawyer, Carole Handler stated: &quot;Our clients are very concerned about many striking similarities and have retained counsel to investigate the situation and, if necessary, to take appropriate action.&quot;

==Episodes==

==U.S. television ratings==
:Note: &quot;Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.&quot;

* In season 3 episode &quot;A Perfect Day&quot; &quot;Cold Case&quot; set a series rating record by attracting an audience of 19.36 million viewers.

===Cancellation===
&quot;Cold Case&quot; began in September 2003 and quickly became a staple of the CBS Sunday night schedule. The crime drama had a successful first season and, by season two, was averaging a 3.5 rating in the 18–49 demographic and 15.1 million viewers. For the next couple seasons, total viewership fell slightly but the demographic numbers rose, reaching a 3.8 rating in season four.

In season five, the show averaged a 2.9 rating and just under 11 million viewers and ranked 28th. In season six, the ratings sank lower, to an average of a 2.7 rating but climbed up to 12 million viewers and ranked 20th. CBS made a choice between renewing &quot;Without a Trace&quot; and &quot;Cold Case&quot;. They chose to keep &quot;Cold Case&quot;. The real ratings trouble began in the final season, when the show&#x27;s ratings dropped even further to a 2.15 rating in the 18–49 demographic and 9.6 million viewers. One reason for this is that the show aired at 10:00 pm; the ratings dropped 25% to 9 million viewers. On November 22, 2009, CBS made a final attempt to increase the ratings by scheduling &quot;Cold Case&quot; at 9:00 pm. The ratings increased to 10 million viewers, but it was short-lived because on February 14, 2010, &quot;Cold Case&quot; returned to its original schedule, at 10:00 pm and the ratings dropped. The show concluded its run in May 2010 ranking at #29. More than two weeks after the series finale aired, CBS announced the show would not be renewed for an eighth season.

On May 18, 2010, CBS announced the cancellation of the series after seven seasons and 156 episodes.

Since it had become customary to end each season with a cliffhanger, season 7&#x27;s final episode, &quot;Shattered&quot;, ended leaving viewers wondering about the fates of several characters. The cancellation of the show left those questions unresolved.

In April 2024, a revival of the series was under discussion, but in September 2024 &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that a deal for the proposed series could not be reached between Warner Brothers Television and CBS.

== Distribution ==
=== Broadcast ===
The series aired in syndication on CBS, and also on Ion Television in the U.S. and on Viva in Canada. Sleuth also aired the series occasionally. In 2011, the show aired on MyNetworkTV. The show made its debut on the new over-the-air channel Start TV when it launched on September 3, 2018. It also airs on MBC Action. As of 2022, reruns are often shown on TNT channel.

===Home media and streaming===
After the program&#x27;s debut in 2003, the show was not released on DVD or Blu-ray due to licensing issues related to the use of contemporary music in each episode.

In May 2020, the Roku Channel in the United States released all episodes of &quot;Cold Case&quot; to stream for the first time, in a high-definition digital format, with full subtitles and all contemporary music from the original CBS broadcasts left intact. The streaming ended in December 2020. The show returned to the service in September 2021.

&quot;Cold Case&quot; was made available for streaming on Max as of June 19, 2023.

All seasons of &quot;Cold Case&quot; are also available to stream on Amazon Prime in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Latin America and India.

The series also airs on Quest Red in the United Kingdom and available for streaming on Discovery+.

<text>The gallopheasants (genus Lophura) are pheasants of the family Phasianidae. The genus comprises 11 species and several subspecies. Several species in this genus are known as firebacks, including crestless and crested firebacks, as well as the Siamese fireback.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lophura&quot; was introduced in 1822 by the Scottish naturalist John Fleming to accommodate a single species, the Bornean crested fireback (&quot;Phasianus ignitus&quot; Shaw, 1798) which is therefore considered to be the type species by monotypy. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek λοφος/&quot;lophos&quot; meaning &quot;crest&quot; with ουρα/&quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot;.

==Species==
The genus contains the following 11 species: 
&quot;Lophura hatinhensis&quot; and &quot;Lophura hoogerwerfi&quot; are sometimes considered subspecies, leaving this genus with only 11 species. Other subspecies are also sometimes considered distinct species.

*&quot;Lophura × imperialis&quot; - imperial pheasant

<text>David Sztybel (born 2 February 1967) is a Canadian philosopher specializing in animal ethics.

==Education and career==
Sztybel was born in Toronto, Ontario. He obtained his BA in philosophy in 1991, his MA in 1994, and his PhD in 2000 – for a thesis entitled &quot;Empathy and Rationality in Ethics&quot; – from the University of Toronto.

He fulfilled an Advisory Research Committee Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Queen&#x27;s University (2001-2002), held a fellowship at the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics (2007–2011), and a research fellowship at the University of Vienna (2011 to present). Most of his work is related to animal rights.

Sztybel has been a vegan since 1988.

==Research==
Sztybel has developed a new theory of animal rights which he terms &quot;best caring&quot;, as outlined in his paper &quot;The Rights of Animal Persons&quot;. Criticizing conventional theories of rights based on intuition, traditionalism or common sense, compassion, Immanuel Kant&#x27;s theory, John Rawls&#x27;s theory, and Alan Gewirth&#x27;s theory, Sztybel devises a new theory of rights for human and nonhuman animals. Sztybel bases his theory, in part, on the idea that sentient beings are ends-in-themselves, a theory of emotional cognition which verifies that some things really are good or bad for sentient beings. This is a non-utilitarian or &quot;individuals-respecting&quot; theory that defends the proposition that all sentient beings should be legally recognized as persons.

He is critical of utilitarianism and the traditional feminist ethics of care. He also takes issue with the traditional notion of animal welfare, which supports the use of animals if steps are taken to avoid &quot;unnecessary&quot; suffering, the parameters of which vary. Sztybel argues that we would never call the same treatment of humans, mentally disabled or otherwise, to be consistent with their welfare. He coined the term &quot;animal illfare&quot; to describe conventional animal treatment. He holds that true animal welfare would only entail wishing animals good (never anything avoidably malicious). He supports that fully realized substantial animal rights correspond to a significant respect for all sentient beings.

Sztybel contends that Singer&#x27;s philosophy of animal liberation is not really about liberating animals in general; he accuses Singer of being a speciesist for defending the vivisection of animals on the ground that they have inferior cognitive capacities. In so doing, Singer is effectively sanctioning the harmful treatment of nonhuman animals on the basis of a species-characteristic which does not justify violent treatment.

He also provides a critique of the abolitionist views of Gary L. Francione and Joan Dunayer, who argue that animal rights supporters should not pursue a welfarist approach. A defense of suffering-reduction laws and a discussion of the logical problems of anti-welfarism are featured in Sztybel&#x27;s article &quot;Animal Rights Law: Fundamentalism versus Pragmatism&quot;.

<text>2829 Bobhope (&quot;prov. designation&quot;: ) is a dark asteroid of the Meliboea family, from the outer region of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 9 August 1948, by South African astronomer Ernest Leonard Johnson at Union Observatory in Johannesburg. The asteroid was later named after comedian Bob Hope. The asteroid has a rotation period of 6.1 hours and measures approximately in diameter.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Bobhope&quot; is a member of the Meliboea family, a smaller asteroid family of carbonaceous outer-belt asteroids with a few hundred members, named after 137 Meliboea. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.5–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,985 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first observed as at the discovering observatory in May 1942, yet the astrometric data from this observation remained unused to extend its observation arc prior to the official discovery date.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named for English-born, American comedian Bob Hope (1903–2003), star of innumerable feature film, theater, TV and radio productions, and known for the horror comedy &quot;Cat and the Canary&quot; (1939). He hosted the Academy Awards more than any other host, and received several Honorary and Special Oscars himself. Hope also received more than forty honorary doctorates. The was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 September 1993 ().

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Bobhope&quot; has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, which agrees with the overall spectral type of the Meliboea family.

=== Rotation period ===

A rotational lightcurve of &quot;Bobhope&quot; was obtained from photometric observations by astronomer Landy Carbo at Oakley Southern Sky Observatory , Australia, and at the U.S. Oakley Observatory in September 2008. It gave it a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude (). A previously published lightcurve by French amateur astronomer Bernard Christophe gave a somewhat longer period of hours with an amplitude of 0.50 ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Bobhope&quot; measures between 32.14 and 40.98 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.05 and 0.0916. More dated NEOWISE publications gave a larger diameter of 41.361 and 44.8 kilometers, respectively. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.0586 and a diameter of 38.0 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 10.8.

<text>The Hartt School is the performing arts conservatory of the University of Hartford, a private university in West Hartford, Connecticut. Founded in 1920 by Julius Hartt and Moshe Paranov, Hartt has been part of the University of Hartford since its charter merged the Hartt College of Music, the Hartford Art School, and Hillyer College to create the university in 1957. The Hartt School offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in music, dance, theatre, and associated disciplines. The Hartt Community Division offers a variety of opportunities in music and dance for students of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities.

== Organ Studies ==
Since its founding, Hartt had an organ program of study. In 1970, the school acquired a new Gress-Miles pipe organ; it was inaugurated with a performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Wir glauben all&#x27; an einen Gott&quot;. The organ program&#x27;s director, John Holtz, subsequently launched the International Contemporary Organ Music Festival which ran from 1971 to 1984, and brought world-wide attraction to Hartt with new organ music commissions and performances from major composers and organists, including Marilyn Mason, William Albright, Iannis Xenakis, and William Bolcom. In 1982, the festival expanded to include harpsichord music. In 2015, facing total declinement of enrollment, the school closed down its organ studies program and sold the Gress-Miles organ to United Methodist Church in Babylon, New York. As of 2022, faculty member Scott Lamlein re-started a Foundations of Organ Performance course available to Hartt piano students, taught on a 1986 Wolff studio pipe organ.

<text>Kathryn Morris (born January 28, 1969) is an American actress, best known for her lead role as Detective Lilly Rush in the CBS series &quot;Cold Case&quot;.

==Career==
Morris&#x27;s first role was a minor one in the 1991 tele-movie &quot;Long Road Home&quot;. Several other small parts followed, including a bit part as a psychiatric patient in the Oscar-winning &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;. Her breakthrough role came as Lt. Annalisa &quot;Stinger&quot; Lindstrom in the television series &quot;&quot; in 1997 for two seasons. Morris continued to work in films (notably ones directed by Rod Lurie) and had a brief stint on the &quot;&quot; series in 1999 as Najara.

After seeing her in the film &quot;The Contender&quot; (which DreamWorks distributed), Steven Spielberg cast her in two successive films. Her scenes as a rock star in &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, which required Morris to take intensive singing and guitar lessons were cut from the film by the director, which was particularly agonizing for her. In &quot;Minority Report&quot;, she portrayed the tormented wife of Tom Cruise&#x27;s character.

In 2003, Morris won the lead role of detective Lilly Rush in the CBS dramatic series &quot;Cold Case&quot;. She also appeared in the 2004 films &quot;Mindhunters&quot; and &quot;Paycheck&quot;, opposite Ben Affleck, and more recently as the journalist wife of Josh Hartnett in Lurie&#x27;s drama &quot;Resurrecting the Champ&quot; (2007). Morris appeared in the film &quot;Cougars, Inc.&quot; which was distributed in 2011. In 2012, Morris appeared in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;The Sweeter Side of Life&quot;, a romantic comedy.

==Personal life==
Morris was born in 1969 in Cincinnati, Ohio. She grew up Christian in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, with her parents, Stanley, a Bible scholar, and Joyce, an insurance agent, and five siblings before moving away. From age 6 to 17, Morris and her family traveled the southern &#x27;Bible Belt&#x27; as a gospel group called &#x27;The Morris Code&#x27;. The group was mainly made up of Morris&#x27;s father and three (out of five) of her siblings.

She attended two colleges in the Philadelphia area, Northeastern Christian Junior College and Temple University. After studying theatre in high school, she was involved in a hit-and-run collision while on her way to her first acting gig, a Japanese music video based on the musical &quot;Grease&quot;. She still made it to the gig and that&#x27;s when she knew she was going to be an actress.

Morris was in a relationship with actor Johnny Messner. On April 8, 2013, Morris announced they were expecting twins. She gave birth to twin boys, who were diagnosed with autism when they were three years old. In October 2021, Morris launched &quot;The Savants&quot;: an initiative to &quot;revolutionize how the world lives on and off the spectrum&quot;.

<doc id="633493" wikidata="Q808616" url="?curid=633493" title="Baron Furnivall">
<text>Baron Furnivall is an ancient title in the Peerage of England. It was originally created (by writ) when Thomas de Furnivall was summoned to the Model Parliament on 24 June 1295 as Lord Furnivall. The barony eventually passed to Thomas Nevill, who had married the first baron&#x27;s descendant Joan de Furnivall, and he was summoned to parliament in her right. Their daughter, Maud de Neville, married John Talbot, who was also summoned to parliament in her right. He was later created Earl of Shrewsbury. On the death of the seventh earl in 1616, the barony fell into abeyance. The abeyance was terminated naturally in favour of the earl&#x27;s daughter Alethea Howard in 1651 and passed through her to the Dukes of Norfolk. On the death of the ninth Duke in 1777, the barony again fell into abeyance. In 1913 the abeyance was terminated again in favour of Mary Frances Katherine Petre, daughter of Bernard Petre, 14th Baron Petre. Through her father she was a great-great-great-granddaughter of the ninth Baron Petre and his first wife Anne Howard, niece of the ninth Duke of Norfolk (and 18th Baron Furnivall), who became co-heir to the Barony on her uncle&#x27;s death in 1777. On Lady Furnivall&#x27;s death in 1968 the barony fell into abeyance for the third time.

* Thomas de Furnivall, 2nd Baron Furnivall (1301–1339), son; summoned from 1318 onward as Baron Furnivall (acceleration or new creation?). He married firstly Joan, daughter and co-heir of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun.
* Thomas de Furnivall, 3rd Baron Furnivall (1322–1364), son
* William de Furnivall, 4th Baron Furnivall (1326–1383), brother

**Co-heirs: Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke (died 1649 without issue); Elizabeth Grey, Countess of Kent (died 1651 without issue); and Alethea Howard, Countess of Arundel (died 1654 with issue)
* Alethea Howard, 14th Baroness Talbot, 17th Baroness Strange of Blackmere, 13th Baroness Furnivall née Talbot (d. 1654) (abeyance terminated as sole heir 1651)
* Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk, 14th Baron Furnivall (1627–1677)
* Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk, 15th Baron Furnivall (1628–1684)
* Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk, 16th Baron Furnivall (1655–1701)
* Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk, 17th Baron Furnivall (1683–1732)

**List of co-heirs:
* Mary Dent, 19th Baroness Furnivall (1900–1968) (abeyance terminated by Crown 1913; abeyant 1968)

The co-heiresses since the 19th Baroness&#x27;s death have been her daughters the Hon. Rosamond Mary Dent and the Hon. Mrs. Patricia Mary Bence. As Rosamond is a nun (Sister Ancilla Dent, OSB), and therefore without issue, the barony will upon her death come out of abeyance either to the Hon. Mrs. Bence or, if she predeceases her sister, to Francis Hornsby (b. 21 April 1958), Mrs. Bence&#x27;s son.

Originally, crinoline described a stiff fabric made of horsehair (&quot;crin&quot;) and cotton or linen which was used to make underskirts and as a dress lining. The term crin or crinoline continues to be applied to a nylon stiffening tape used for interfacing and lining hemlines in the 21st century.

By the 1850s the term crinoline was more usually applied to the fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.

The steel-hooped cage crinoline, first patented in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and by their agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, gutta-percha, and even inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and the bustle had largely replaced the crinoline.

The crinoline silhouette was revived several times in the 20th century, particularly in the late 1940s as a result of Christian Dior&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot; of 1947. The flounced nylon and net petticoats worn in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s to poof out skirts also became known as crinolines even when there were no hoops in their construction. In the mid-1980s Vivienne Westwood designed the mini-crini, a mini-length crinoline which was highly influential on 1980s fashion. Late 20th and early 21st century designers such as John Galliano and Alexander McQueen have become famous for their updated crinoline designs. Since the 1980s and well into the 21st century the crinoline has remained a popular option for formal evening dresses, wedding dresses, and ball gowns.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;crinoline&quot; is often described as a combination of the Latin word (&quot;hair&quot;) and/or the French word (&quot;horsehair&quot;); with the Latin word (&quot;thread&quot; or &quot;flax,&quot; which was used to make linen), describing the materials used in the original textile.

In the 21st century, the term crin is still used to describe a type of woven nylon flat braid, available in various widths and used for stiffening and providing bulk-free body to hemlines, serving the same purpose as the original crin/crinoline. Crin tape/trim is typically transparent, though it also comes in black, white, and cream colors. It is also described as horsehair braid or crinoline tape.
==Pre-1850==
The crinoline was not the first garment designed to support the wearer&#x27;s skirts in a fashionable shape. Whilst the bell-shaped skirts seen on statuettes from the ancient Minoan civilization are often compared to crinolines, particularly under the assumption that hoops were required to retain their shape, there is no evidence to confirm this and the theory is usually dismissed.

The crinoline&#x27;s ancestors are more typically recognised as the Spanish , later known as the farthingale, widely worn in Europe from the late 15th century to the early 17th century, and the side-hoops and panniers worn throughout the 18th century.

The horsehair fabric called crinoline was first noted by 1829, when it was offered for lining and dress-making. That year, Rudolph Ackermann&#x27;s &quot;Repository of Fashions&quot; described the new textile as a &quot;fine clear stuff, not unlike in appearance to leno, but of a very strong and durable description: it is made in different colours; grey, and the colour of unbleached cambric are most in favour.&quot;

Petticoats made of horsehair crinoline appeared around 1839, proving so successful that the name &#x27;crinoline&#x27; began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was being used as a stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as &#x27;crinoline&#x27;, and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.

==Late 19th century==
===1850s–60s===
The cage crinoline made out of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a &quot;skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape&quot;) granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising &quot;elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.&quot; Following its introduction, the women&#x27;s rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth, noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One of the most significant manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson &amp; Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson&#x27;s London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859, the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas &amp; Sherwood factory in Manhattan used one ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.
The crinoline needed to be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha, and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due to the use of brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs, and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.
Despite some claims, such as that by the historian Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to around, the photo-historian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between . Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing with the assistance of several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur&#x27;s market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the museum&#x27;s collection.

===Crinolettes and 1880s revival===
The crinoline began to fall out of fashion from about 1866. A modified version, the crinolette, was a transitional garment bridging the gap between the cage crinoline and the bustle. Fashionable from 1867 through to the mid-1870s, the crinolette was typically composed of half-hoops, sometimes with internal lacing or ties designed to allow adjustment of fullness and shape. The crinolette was still worn in the early 1880s, with an 1881 article describing it as sticking out solely behind, as opposed to projecting &quot;hideously at the side&quot; like the crinoline. It is possible that some of the smaller crinolines that survive were worn in combination with separate bustles, rather than in isolation. During the 1880s the cage crinoline was revived, with hoop petticoats designed to accommodate the extremely large bustles of the period and support the skirt hems. One of the mid-1880s styles was called the lobster pot due to its resemblance to a lobster trap. Due to the extreme weight of the fabrics of the decade, the hoops of the crinolines were crossed over each other behind the legs in order to support and hold the skirts firmly in place. As with the earlier cage crinolines, sprung steel, wire and cane were used.

===Critical response===

Unlike the farthingales and panniers, the crinoline was worn by women of every social class. The fashion swiftly became the subject of intense scrutiny in Western media. Critical articles on the crinoline were published by the Hungarian journal (1858) and the Bulgarian journalist Petko Slaveykov in 1864. In the 1850s, the Welsh poet Dafydd Jones wrote a ballad decrying the fashion. A similar sentiment was expressed by a Russian song published in 1854, where the singer complains about his wife having assumed the fashion. In 1855, an observer of Queen Victoria&#x27;s state visit to Paris complained that despite the number of foreigners present, Western fashions such as the crinoline had diluted national dress to such an extent that everyone, whether Turkish, Scottish, Spanish, or Tyrolean, dressed alike. Victoria herself is popularly said to have detested the fashion, inspiring a song in &quot;Punch&quot; that started: &quot;Long live our gracious Queen/Who won&#x27;t wear crinoline!&quot; Gernsheim has noted that the Queen was often photographed in crinolines, and suggests that this misunderstanding came from a request made by Victoria that female guests attending her daughter&#x27;s marriage in 1858 should leave their hoops off due to limited space in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace.

The crinoline was perceived as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies&#x27; disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.
Arthur Munby observed that in the &quot;barbarous locality&quot; of Wigan, the sight of a female colliery worker wearing trousers was &quot;not half as odd as a woman wearing a crinoline.&quot; In Australia, poorer rural women were photographed posing outside their slab huts, wearing their best dresses with crinolines. The French sociologist and economist Frédéric le Play carried out surveys of French working-class families&#x27; wardrobes from 1850 to 1875, in which he found that two women had crinolines in their wardrobe, both wives of skilled workers. One, the fashion-conscious wife of a glove-maker, owned two crinolines and eleven dresses, although her usual everyday clothing consisted of wooden shoes and printed aprons. In America, the mid-19th century crinoline has become popularly associated with the image of the Southern Belle, a young woman from the American Deep South&#x27;s upper socioeconomic, slave-owning planter classes. However, as in Europe and elsewhere, the crinoline was far from exclusively worn by wealthy women. Both black and white women in America of all classes and social standings wore hooped skirts, including First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and her African-American dressmaker, Elizabeth Keckley, who created many of Lincoln&#x27;s own extravagant crinolines.

The difficulties associated with the garment, such as its size, the problems and hazards associated with wearing and moving about in it, and the fact that it was worn so widely by women of all social classes, were frequently exaggerated and parodied in satirical articles and illustrations such as those in &quot;Punch&quot;. Alexander Maxwell has summarised crinoline mockery as expressing the male authors&#x27; insecurity and fears that women, whose crinolines took up &quot;enough space for five,&quot; would eventually &quot;conquer&quot; mankind. Julia Thomas, observing the extent of &quot;Punch&quot;&#x27;s anti-crinoline sentiment and mockery, noted that the magazine&#x27;s attacks, rather than crushing the fashion, exacerbated and even invented the phenomenon of &quot;crinolinemania.&quot;

====Hazards====

The flammability of the crinoline was widely reported. Although trustworthy statistics on crinoline-related fatalities are rare, Florence Nightingale estimated that at least 630 women died from their clothes catching fire in 1863–1864. One such incident, the death of a 14-year-old kitchenmaid called Margaret Davey was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; on 13 February 1863. Her dress, &quot;distended by a crinoline,&quot; ignited as she stood on the fender of the fireplace to reach some spoons on the mantelpiece, and she died as a result of extensive burns. The Deputy-Coroner, commenting that he was &quot;astonished to think that the mortality from such a fashion was not brought more conspicuously under the notice of the Registrar-General,&quot; passed a verdict of &quot;Accidental death by fire, caused through crinoline.&quot; A similar case was reported later that year, when 16-year-old Emma Musson died after a piece of burning coke rolled from the kitchen fire to ignite her crinoline. A month later, on 8 December 1863, a serious fire at the Church of the Company of Jesus in Santiago, Chile, killed between two and three thousand people. The severity of the death toll is credited in part to the large amounts of flammable fabric that made up the women&#x27;s crinoline dresses. Two notable victims of crinoline fires were William Wilde&#x27;s illegitimate daughters, Emily and Mary, who died in November 1871 of burns sustained after their gowns caught fire. Although flame-retardant fabrics were available, these were thought unattractive and were unpopular.

Other risks associated with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people&#x27;s feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off her feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.

The crinoline was worn by some factory workers, leading to the textiles firm Courtaulds instructing female employees in 1860 to leave their hoops and crinolines at home. Cecil Willett Cunnington described seeing a photograph of female employees in the Bryant and May match factories wearing crinolines while at work. A report in &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot; of 2 June 1864 recorded the death of Ann Rollinson from injuries sustained after her crinoline was caught by a revolving machinery shaft in a mangling room at Firwood bleach works.

==20th century==

During World War I, the &quot;war crinoline&quot; became fashionable, between 1915 and 1917. This style featured wide, full mid-calf length skirts, and was described as practical (for enabling freedom of walking and movement) and patriotic, as the sight of attractively dressed women was expected to cheer up soldiers on leave. The full skirts of the war crinoline endured in the robe de style of the 1920s.

In the late 1930s, just before the outbreak of World War II, there was a revival of the hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.
Following World War II, crinolines were once again revived by designers such as Christian Dior, whose 1947 &quot;New Look&quot; featured full skirts supported by stiffened underskirts. Loschek has suggested that, by explicitly referencing the Belle Époque era and reviving historic styles of corsets and crinolines in his &quot;New Look,&quot; Dior was the first designer to introduce the idea of postmodernism to fashion, albeit unconsciously. Crinolines were popular throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s. These were sold in a few clothing stores as late as 1970.

The American designer Anne Fogarty was particularly noted for her full-skirted designs worn over crinoline petticoats, which were always separate garments from the dress to enable ease of movement and travelling. &quot;Life&quot; reported in 1953 on how one of Fogarty&#x27;s crinoline designs from 1951 was almost exactly duplicated by a design in Dior&#x27;s latest collection. Hooped, tiered and/or ruffled crinoline petticoats in nylon, net and cotton were widely worn, as were skirts with integrated hoops.
In the mid-1980s Vivienne Westwood revisited the crinoline, taking inspiration from the ballet &quot;Petrushka&quot; to produce miniskirt length versions that she christened the &quot;mini-crini.&quot; The mini-crini silhouette influenced the work of other designers such as Christian Lacroix&#x27;s &quot;puffball&quot; skirts. The Westwood mini-crini was described in 1989 as a combination of two conflicting ideals – the crinoline, representing a &quot;mythology of restriction and encumbrance,&quot; and the miniskirt, representing an &quot;mythology of liberation.&quot;

Late 20th- and early 21st-century fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen and John Galliano often used crinolines in their designs, with the skirt of one of Galliano&#x27;s ballgowns for Dior in 1998 reaching a width of 9 feet. Galliano specifically visited the original crinoline manufacturers that Christian Dior himself had used in order to inform and influence his own designs. McQueen was fascinated by the crinoline and often referenced it in his collections, cutting away leather ballgowns to reveal the cage beneath, or making it out of silver-decorated cut metal. One of McQueen&#x27;s most notable crinoline designs was modelled by the amputee model Aimee Mullins in a series of photographs by Nick Knight for &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, in which Mullin&#x27;s cage crinoline, deliberately worn without overskirts in order to reveal her prosthetic legs, was described as suggesting both a walking frame and a cage to &quot;contain the unruliness of the unwhole&quot;. The images from this shoot were declared among the most significant commercial images of 1998, representing Knight and McQueen&#x27;s dedication to presenting alternatives to the traditional concepts of fashion and physical beauty. After McQueen&#x27;s death in 2010, his successor, Sarah Burton, continued the tradition of designing crinolines for the McQueen brand.

==21st century==

Crinolines continue to be worn well into the 21st century, typically as part of formal outfits such as evening gowns, prom dresses, quinceañera dresses, and wedding dresses.
1950s and 1960s style net crinolines are a traditional element of costumes for square dancing and clogging. They are also popular garments for attending 1950s and 1960s influenced rockabilly events such as Viva Las Vegas. The steampunk movement has also appropriated cage crinolines along with other elements of 19th century fashion such as corsets and the top hat for its costuming.
In some contexts, the traditional hooped crinoline may be seen as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.

<text>Mani (; – 2 March AD 274 or 26 February AD 277) was an Iranian prophet and the founder of Manichaeism, a religion most prevalent in late antiquity.

Mani was born in or near Ctesiphon (south of modern Baghdad) in Mesopotamia, at the time part of the Parthian Empire. Seven of his major works were written in Syriac, and the eighth, dedicated to the Sasanian emperor Shapur I, was written in Middle Persian. He died shortly after being imprisoned by Bahram I in Gundeshapur.

==Etymology==
The exact meaning of the name remains unsolved. It may have derived from Babylonian-Aramaic &quot;Mânâ&quot; [luminescence]. Mandaeans used the term &quot;mânâ rabba&quot;, which means &quot;Enlightened Lord/King&quot;. Ancient Greek interpretations were (, &quot;vessel, instrument&quot;) and (, intercourse, company, communion, instruction)&quot;.&quot;

The same slightly contemptuous &quot;a certain&quot; (Manes quidam) also appears in Hegemonius&#x27; Acta Archelai (4th century), however, Hegemonius contributes a detailed description of Mani&#x27;s looks. Mani’s names became the object of uplifting transformation (Greek, Coptic Mannichaios, Latin Mannichaeus, i.e., Mannam fundens &quot;pouring out Manna&quot;). Alternatively, due to Mani&#x27;s possible origins in an Elchasai community, &quot;Mani&quot; could be a Hypocorism of the Hebrew name Menahem (&quot;the consoler&quot; or &quot;comforter&quot;).

==Sources==
In 1969 in Upper Egypt a Greek parchment codex dating to was discovered. It is now designated &quot;Codex Manichaicus Coloniensis&quot; because it is conserved at the University of Cologne. Combining a hagiographic account of Mani&#x27;s career and spiritual development with information about Mani&#x27;s religious teachings, and containing fragments of his writings, it is now considered the most reliable source of information about the historical Mani.

All other medieval and pre-medieval accounts of his life are either legendary or hagiographical, such as the account in &quot;Fihrist&quot; by Ibn al-Nadim, purportedly by al-Biruni, or were anti-Manichaean polemics, such as the 4th-century &quot;Acta Archelai&quot;. Among these medieval accounts, Ibn al-Nadim&#x27;s account of Mani&#x27;s life and teachings is generally speaking the most reliable and exhaustive. Notably, the (in other accounts prominent) image of the &quot;Third Ambassador&quot; is only represented through a brief mention of the name &quot;bašīr&quot;, &quot;messenger of good news&quot;, and the topos of &quot;Mani the Painter&quot; (which in other Islamic accounts almost completely replaces that of &quot;the founder of a religion&quot;) is completely absent.

==Life==

This work and other evidence discovered in the 20th century establishes Mani as a historical individual. For an updated critique of the standard account and a radically alternative proposal see Iain Gardner&#x27;s &quot;The Founder of Manichaeism: Rethinking the Life of Mani.&quot;

=== Early life ===
Mani was born near Seleucia-Ctesiphon, perhaps in the town Mardinu in the Babylonian district of Nahr Kutha; according to other accounts in the town Abrumya. Mani&#x27;s father Pātik (Middle Persian &quot;Pattūg&quot;; , Arabic: ), a native of Ecbatana (now Hamadan, Iran), was a member of the Jewish Christian sect of the Elcesaites. His mother was of Parthian descent (from &quot;the Armenian Arsacid family of Kamsarakan&quot;); her name is reported variously, among others &quot;Maryam&quot;.

Mani was raised in a heterodox environment in Babylon. The Elcesaite community was ostensibly Jewish Christian, though with some Gnostic features due to their Ebionite heritage, such as the belief in recurring incarnations of heavenly apostles, one of whom was a docetic Christ. It is believed that his Christian roots might have been influenced by Marcion and Bardaisan. At ages 12 and 24 Mani had visionary experiences of a &quot;heavenly twin&quot; of his (&quot;syzygos&quot;), calling him to leave his father&#x27;s sect and preach the true message of Jesus in a new gospel. It is said that his appearance was a mixture of Iranian and Mesopotamian features. On the one hand he looked like a warrior, on the other like a magician. In some later texts he was described as lame, a characteristic possibly attributed to him by his opponents.

=== Travelling to India ===
Mani then travelled to India (Sakas in present day Afghanistan), where he studied Hinduism and its various extant philosophies, as well as Buddhism. Al-Biruni says Mani only traveled to India after being banished from Persia, but this might be an error or a second journey. 

=== Return from India ===
Returning in 242, Mani presented himself to Shapur I, to whom he dedicated his only work written in Persian, known as the &quot;Shabuhragan&quot;. Shapur was not converted to Manichaeism and remained Zoroastrian, but he favored Mani&#x27;s teachings, which mixed Christianity, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism, and took him into his court. Mani is said to have performed miracles, including levitation, teleporting and healing, which helped him to gain converts in the Iranian elite. He was also famed as a painter.

=== Imprisonment and execution ===
Shapur&#x27;s successor Hormizd I, who reigned only for one year, continued to patronize Mani, but his successor Bahram I, a follower of the intolerant Zoroastrian reformer Kartir, began to persecute the Manichaeans. He incarcerated Mani, who died in prison within a month, in 274. According to sources, he passed his last days comforting his visiting disciples, teaching that his death would have no other consequence than the return of his soul to the realm of light.

Mani&#x27;s followers depicted Mani&#x27;s death as a crucifixion in a conscious analogy to the crucifixion of Jesus; al-Biruni says that Bahram ordered the execution of Mani. There is a story which claims that he was flayed, and his corpse suspended over the main gate of the great city of Gundeshapur; however, there is no historical basis for this account. It is more plausible that his body was mutilated via post-mortem decapitation, and his head put on display, which may be the original source of the embellishment.

==Works==
The canon of Mani includes six works originally written in Syriac, and one in Persian, the &quot;Shapuragan&quot;. While none of his books have survived in complete form, there are numerous fragments and quotations of them, including a long Syriac quotation from one of his works, as well as a large amount of material in Middle Persian, Coptic, and numerous other languages.

Examples of surviving portions of his works include: the &quot;Shabuhragan&quot; (Middle Persian), the &quot;Book of Giants&quot; (numerous fragments in many languages), the &quot;Fundamental Epistle&quot; (quoted in length by Saint Augustine), a number of fragments of his &quot;Living Gospel&quot; (or&quot; Great Gospel&quot;), a Syriac excerpt quoted by Theodore Bar Konai, and his &quot;Letter to Edessa&quot; contained in the &quot;Cologne Mani-Codex&quot;. Mani also wrote the book &quot;Arzhang&quot;, a holy book of Manichaeism unique in that it contained many drawings and paintings to express and explain the Manichaeist creation and history of the world.

==Teaching==
Mani&#x27;s teaching was intended to &quot;combine&quot;, succeed, and surpass the teachings of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Marcionism, Hellenistic and Rabbinic Judaism, Gnostic movements, Babylonian and other Mesopotamian religions, and mystery cults. It is based on a rigid dualism of good and evil, locked in eternal struggle, which was a &quot;familiar mytholog[ical]&quot; element of the time in many spiritual traditions that Mani deliberately borrowed.

In his mid-twenties, Mani decided that salvation was possible through education, self-denial, fasting and chastity. According to Al-Biruni, a 10th-century Iranian scholar, Mani claimed to be the &quot;Paraclete&quot; promised in the New Testament, and the Last Prophet. However according to Lodewijk J. R. Ort, the term last prophet may &quot;in all probability derived from the Quran by Al-Buruni in order to formulate Mani&#x27;s pretensions and religious claims&quot;. Therefore Lodewijk J. R. Ort concludes that a definitive pronouncement about the final character of Mani&#x27;s appearance is not mentioned in Manichaeistic scriptures.&quot;

According to Christian eschatology, Jesus, not Mani, will perform the final judgment at the conclusion of history.

While his religion was not strictly a movement of Christian Gnosticism in the earlier mode, Mani did declare himself to be an &quot;apostle of Jesus Christ&quot;, and extant Manichaean poetry frequently extols Jesus and his mother, Mary, with the highest reverence. Manichaean tradition also claims that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures including Jesus, Zoroaster, and the historical Buddha.

Mani&#x27;s followers were organized in a church structure, divided into a class of &quot;elects&quot; (&quot;electi&quot;) and &quot;auditors&quot; (&quot;auditores&quot;). Only the &quot;electi&quot; are required to follow the laws strictly, while the &quot;auditores&quot; care for them, hoping to become &quot;electi&quot; in their turn after reincarnation.

==Christian and Islamic tradition==
===Late Antique Christian accounts in the West===
The Western Christian tradition of Mani is based on Socrates of Constantinople, a historian writing in the 5th century. According to this account, one Scythianos, a Saracen, husband of an Egyptian woman, &quot;introduced the doctrine of Empedocles and Pythagoras into Christianity&quot;; that he had a disciple, &quot;Buddas, formerly named Terebinthus&quot;, who travelled in Persia, where he alleged that he had been born of a virgin, and afterwards wrote four books, one of Mysteries, a second The Gospel, a third The Treasure, and a fourth Heads. While performing some mystic rites, he was hurled down a precipice by a daimon, and killed.

A woman at whose house he lodged buried him, took over his property, and bought a boy of seven, named Cubricus. This boy she freed and educated, leaving him the property and books of Buddas-Terebinthus. Cubricus then travelled into Persia, where he took the name of Manes and gave forth the doctrines of Buddas Terebinthus as his own. The king of Persia, hearing that he worked miracles, sent for him to heal his sick son, and on the child&#x27;s dying put Manes in prison. Thence he escaped, flying into Mesopotamia, but was traced, captured, and flayed alive by the Persian king&#x27;s orders, the skin being then stuffed with chaff and hung up before the gate of the city.

According to Jerome, Archelaus wrote his account of his disputation with &quot;Manichæus&quot; in Syriac, whence it was translated into Greek. The Greek is lost, and the work, apart from extracts, subsists only in a Latin translation from the Greek, of doubtful age and fidelity, probably made after the 5th century. By Photius it is stated that Heraclean, bishop of Chalcedon, in his book against the Manichæans, said the &quot;Disputation of Archelaus&quot; was written by one Hegemonius, an author not otherwise traceable, and of unknown date.

In the Latin narrative, &quot;Manes&quot; is said to have come, after his flight from court, from Arabion, a frontier fortress, to Caschar or Carchar, a town said to be in Roman Mesopotamia, in the hope of converting an eminent Christian there, named Marcellus, to whom he had sent a letter beginning: &quot;Manichæus apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints and virgins with me, send peace to Marcellus.&quot; In his train he brought twenty-two (or twelve) youths and virgins.

At the request of Marcellus, he debated on religion with bishop Archelaus, by whom he was vanquished, whereupon he set out to return to Persia. On his way he proposed to debate with a priest at the town of Diodorides. But Archelaus came to take the priest&#x27;s place, and again defeated him, whereupon, fearing to be given up to the Persians by the Christians, he returned to Arabion.

At this stage Archelaus introduces in a discourse to the people his history of &quot;this Manes&quot;, very much to the effect of the recapitulation in Socrates. Among the further details are these: that Scythianus lived &quot;in the time of the Apostles&quot;, that Terebinthus said the name of Buddas had been imposed on him, that in the mountains he had been brought up by an angel, that he had been convicted of imposture by a Persian prophet named Parcus, and by Labdacus, son of Mithra.

Furthermore, that in the disputation he taught concerning the sphere, the two luminaries, the transmigration of souls, and the war of the &quot;Principia&quot; against God, that &quot;Corbicius&quot; or Corbicus, about the age of sixty, translated the books of Terebinthus. He made three chief disciples, Thomas, Addas, and Hermas, of whom he sent the first to Egypt, and the second to Scythia, keeping the third with him. The two former returned when he was in prison, and that he sent them to procure for him the books of the Christians, which he then studied. According to the Latin narrative, finally, Manes on his return to Arabion was seized and taken to the Persian king, by whose orders he was flayed, his body being left to the birds, and his skin, filled with air, hung at the city gate.

===Medieval Islamic accounts===
Mani is described as a painter who set up a sectarian movement in opposition to Zoroastrianism. He was persecuted by Shapur I and fled to Central Asia, where he made disciples and embellished with paintings a &quot;Tchighil&quot; (or &quot;picturarum domus Chinensis&quot;) and another temple called &quot;Ghalbita&quot;. Provisioning in advance a cave which had a spring, he told his disciples he was going to heaven, and would not return for a year, after which time they were to seek him in the cave in question. They then came back there after a year and found him, whereupon he showed them an illustrated book, called &quot;Ergenk&quot;, or &quot;Estenk&quot; Arzhang, which he said he had brought from heaven.

Whereafter he had many followers, with whom he returned to Persia at the death of Shapur. The new king, Hormisdas, joined and protected the sect, and built Mani a castle. The next king, Bahram or Varanes, at first favoured Mani. After getting him to debate with certain Zoroastrian teachers, caused him to be flayed alive, and his skin to be stuffed and hung up. Thereupon most of his followers fled to India and China.

<text>The Avro 504 is a single-engine biplane bomber made by the Avro aircraft company and under licence by others. Production during World War I totalled 8,970 and continued for almost 20 years, making it the most-produced aircraft of any kind that served in any military capacity during the First World War. More than 10,000 were built from 1913 until production ended in 1932.

==Design and development==

First flown from Brooklands by Fred &quot;Freddie&quot; Raynham on 18 September 1913, powered by an Gnome Lambda seven-cylinder rotary engine, the Avro 504 was a development of the earlier Avro 500, designed for training and private flying. It was a two-bay all-wooden biplane with a square-section fuselage.

== Operational history ==
Small numbers of early aircraft were purchased by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) prior to the start of the First World War, and were taken to France when the war started. One of the RFC aircraft was the first British aircraft to be shot down by the Germans, on 22 August 1914. The pilot was 2nd Lt. Vincent Waterfall and his navigator Lt Charles George Gordon Bayly (both of 5 Sqn RFC) The RNAS used four 504s to form a special flight to bomb the Zeppelin works at Friedrichshafen on the shores of Lake Constance. Three set out from Belfort in north-eastern France on 21 November 1914, carrying four bombs each. While one aircraft was shot down, the raid was successful, with several direct hits on the airship sheds and the destruction of the hydrogen generating plant.

Soon obsolete as a frontline aircraft, it came into its own as a trainer, with thousands being built during the war, with the major production types being the 504J and the mass production 504K, designed with modified engine bearers to accommodate a range of engines to cope with engine shortages. 8,340 Avro 504s had been produced by the end of 1918.

In the winter of 1917–18 it was decided to use converted 504Js and 504Ks to equip Home Defence squadrons of the RFC, replacing ageing B.E.2cs, which had poor altitude performance. These aircraft were modified as single-seaters, armed with a Lewis gun above the wing on a Foster mounting, and powered by Gnome or Le Rhône engines. 274 converted Avro 504Js and Ks were issued to eight home defence squadrons in 1918, with 226 still being used as fighters at the end of the First World War.

Following the end of the war, while the type continued in service as the standard trainer of the RAF, large numbers of surplus aircraft were available for sale, both for civil and military use. More than 300 504Ks were placed on the civil register in Britain. Used for training, pleasure flying, banner towing and even barnstorming exhibitions (as was ongoing in North America following World War I with the similar-role, surplus Curtiss JN-4s and Standard J-1s); civil 504s continued flying in large numbers until well into the 1930s.

The embryonic air service of the Soviet Union, formed just after the First World War, used both original Avro 504s and their own &quot;Avrushka&quot; (&quot; Little Avro&quot;) copy of it for primary training as the U-1 in the early 1920s, usually powered by Russian-made copies of the Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine. This Russian version of the 504 was replaced by what would become the most produced biplane in all of aviation history, the Polikarpov Po-2, first known as the U-2; the type remained in Soviet service till the late 1920s, and much later elsewhere.

Although Avro 504s sold to China were training versions, they participated in battles among warlords by acting as bombers with the pilot dropping hand grenades and modified mortar shells .

The improved, redesigned and radial-engined 504N with a new undercarriage was produced by Avro in 1925. After evaluation of two prototypes, one powered by the Bristol Lucifer and the other by the Armstrong-Siddeley Lynx, the Lynx-powered aircraft was selected by the RAF to replace the 504K. 592 were built between 1925 and 1932, equipping the RAF&#x27;s five flying training schools, while also being used as communication aircraft. The 504N was also exported to the armed forces of Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Greece, Siam and South Africa, with licensed production taking place in Denmark, Belgium, Canada, Siam and Japan.

The RAF&#x27;s 504Ns were finally replaced in 1933 by the Avro Tutor, with small numbers continuing in civilian use until 1940, when seven were impressed into RAF service, where they were used for target- and glider-towing.

The 504 was the first British aeroplane to strafe troops on the ground as well as the first British aircraft to make a bombing raid over Germany. It was also the first Allied aeroplane to be downed by enemy anti-aircraft fire and was the first aircraft flown by many future aces, including Billy Bishop.

The 504 is easily recognisable because of the single skid between the wheels, referred to as the &quot;toothpick&quot; in the RAF.

<text>Alias is a comic book series created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Gaydos. It was published by Marvel Comics under Marvel&#x27;s MAX imprint for a total of 28 issues from 2001 to 2004.

The protagonist of &quot;Alias&quot; is Jessica Jones, a former costumed superhero named Jewel who left that life behind to become a private investigator. The running thread is Jessica&#x27;s character development, as her past and personality are revealed to the reader while, simultaneously, she tries to come to terms with them herself.

Characters from the series moved to Bendis&#x27; subsequent series &quot;The Pulse&quot;. The series received generally positive reviews from critics.

&quot;Alias&quot; was the basis of the first season of the Netflix Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) series &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;, which premiered in November 2015. &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;, a follow-up ongoing series to &quot;Alias&quot; created by Bendis and Gaydos as a tie-in to the television series, began publication in 2016.

==Publication history==
&quot;Alias&quot; was one of the titles that launched Marvel&#x27;s &quot;R-Rated&quot; MAX imprint. It was written by Bendis and illustrated for most of its run by Michael Gaydos, with covers by David W. Mack. Bendis relates in a text piece on the letters page of the book&#x27;s final issue that it was one of the reasons the imprint was created. Marvel Publishing President Bill Jemas read a draft of the script for the first issue of &quot;Alias&quot; (which, characteristically, starts with the word &quot;fuck&quot;) and exclaimed, &quot;Why couldn&#x27;t we publish this?&quot;

Being under the MAX imprint imposed certain other limitations on what the creators could do in the series. Bendis gave this as one reason for ending the series and moving the characters to &quot;The Pulse&quot;.

Some of the flashbacks to Jessica Jones&#x27;s past are drawn in the style of classic 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Marvel Comics issues.

==Story arcs==
===&quot;Alias Investigations&quot; and &quot;B Level&quot; (issues #1–9)===
Tasked to look for a missing woman, Jessica finds herself caught in a conspiracy involving Captain America and the President of the United States. Subsequently, she is hired to find the recently missing Rick Jones. The first issue introduces her relationship with Luke Cage, whom she sleeps with after meeting him at a bar. The arc also establishes Jessica&#x27;s friendship with Carol Danvers, who attempts to set her up with Scott Lang. Other characters appearing in the arc include Matt Murdock and Man Mountain Marko.

===&quot;Come Home&quot; (issues #11–15)===
Jessica Jones is assigned to look for a missing girl rumored to be a mutant in a small, prejudiced town. She discovers the girl is a runaway and brings her home.

Issue #15 overlaps with &quot;Daredevil&quot; (Vol 2) #36, which was also written by Brian Michael Bendis. Both issues depict the same scene, in which a disguised Natasha Romanova visits Matt Murdock at his law office, from two different perspectives. The &quot;Alias&quot; scene focuses on Jessica and Luke Cage, who argue about their relationship while stood guard outside Murdock&#x27;s office, while the &quot;Daredevil&quot; version of the scene depicts his conversation with Natasha. The issue goes on to show Jessica&#x27;s first date with Scott Lang.

===&quot;The Underneath&quot; (issues #10, 16–21)===
J. Jonah Jameson hires Jessica to uncover Spider-Man&#x27;s identity. Later, Mattie Franklin, the latest Spider-Woman and Jameson&#x27;s stepdaughter, goes missing and Jessica is asked to find her. In the course of her investigation she discovers that Mattie is embroiled in a criminal underworld producing Mutant Growth Hormone, a drug designed to give ordinary people super-powered abilities. Along the way, Jones meets an unexpected ally in Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, who is also investigating Franklin&#x27;s disappearance. Meanwhile, Jessica&#x27;s relationship with Scott Lang becomes strained after an encounter with Madame Web dredges up bad memories from her past.

===&quot;The Secret Origins of Jessica Jones&quot; (issues #22–23)===
Issues #22-23 depict Jessica&#x27;s teenage years, revealing that she attended Midtown High School with Peter Parker, whom she secretly had a crush on and was present when he was bitten by the spider that gave him his powers. Jessica, then known as Jessica Campbell, loses her parents and brother in a car crash involving truck carrying hazardous materials. After waking up from a coma, Jessica is taken in by the Jones family, and soon discovers that she has developed super-powers. The story ends with Jessica deciding to become a superhero.

===&quot;Purple&quot; (issues #24–28)===
Family members of those murdered by the Purple Man ask Jessica to find evidence of those murders that he never confessed to. Jessica is initially reluctant, due to her history with the Purple Man. After drinking and ending up at Luke Cage&#x27;s apartment, Jessica tells Luke about her history with the Purple Man. During her career as a superhero called Jewel, Jessica encountered the Purple Man at a restaurant. He mind-controlled Jessica for eight months, forcing her to bathe him, watch him have sex with other women, and making her beg for his attention. One day, in a fit of rage the Purple Man ordered Jessica to go and kill superheroes. Although the ensuing fight broke the mind-control over her, Jessica was mistaken for a threat by the Avengers and badly beaten. Jean Grey helped Jessica awaken from her resulting coma, and implanted a psychic defense in her mind in case of future encounters with the Purple Man.

After confronting the Purple Man in prison, he escapes and Jessica is forced to deal with him and her past trauma. Jean Grey triggers Jessica&#x27;s psychic defense, allowing her to defeat him. In the aftermath of the fight, Jessica tells Scott Lang that she is three months pregnant, and that he is not the father. Later that day, Luke arrives to confess his feelings for her. She tells him that she is pregnant with his child, and the series ends with them about to begin a new chapter of their lives.

==Collected editions==

These have since been rereleased with the title of &quot;Jessica Jones: Alias&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
The entire series received generally positive reviews from critics. According to Comicbook Roundup, the series received an average rating of 7.5 out of 10 based on 28 reviews.

==Awards==
The series won the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; Award for &quot;Favorite Comic Series&quot; in 2003, and the Harvey Award for &quot;Best New Series&quot; in 2002.

The series was also nominated for two Eisner Awards in 2004: &quot;Best Continuing Series&quot; and &quot;Best Serialized Story&quot; (for &quot;The Secret Origin of Jessica Jones&quot; &amp; &quot;Purple&quot; in &quot;Alias&quot; #22–28).

==In other media==
&quot;Alias&quot; was adapted into the first season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;. Carol Danvers was replaced by Trish Walker (a composite character of Danvers, Foolkiller, and Patsy Walker) due to the simultaneous development of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (2019).

<doc id="633502" wikidata="Q936519" url="?curid=633502" title="Nisroch">
<text>Nisroch (; ; ) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, a god of Assyria in whose temple King Sennacherib was worshiping when he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer (, ).

The name is most likely a scribal error for &quot;Nimrod&quot;. This hypothetical error would result from the Hebrew letter מ (mem) being replaced with ס (samekh) and the letter ד (dalet) being replaced with ך (kaf). (נסרך for נמרד) Due to the obvious visual similarities of the letters involved and the fact that no Assyrian deity by the name of &quot;Nisroch&quot; has ever been attested, most scholars consider this error to be the most likely explanation for the name.

The name is unknown in Mesopotamian sources, but it has been tentatively identified as the god of agriculture. If &quot;Nisroch&quot; is Ninurta, this would make Ninurta&#x27;s temple at Kalhu the most likely location of Sennacherib&#x27;s murder. Other scholars have attempted to identify Nisroch as Nusku, the Assyrian god of fire. Hans Wildberger rejects all suggested identifications as linguistically implausible.

==Talmudic legend==
In the Talmud, &quot;Nisroch&quot; is actually said to be derived from the Hebrew word &quot;neser.&quot; Neser was the name given to a plank of wood discovered by Sennacherib on his return to Assyria from his campaign in Judah. The sages write that this plank was originally part of Noah&#x27;s Ark, and that Sennacherib worshiped it as an idol. It would therefore be concluded that it was this idol that Sennacherib was worshiping when he was murdered by his two sons.

==Nisroch as a demon==
In the sixteenth century, Nisroch became seen as a demon. The Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer listed Nisroch in his &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (1577) as the &quot;chief cook&quot; of Hell. Nisroch appears in Book VI of John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (first published in 1667) as one of Satan&#x27;s demons. Nisroch, who is described as frowning and wearing beaten armor, calls into question Satan&#x27;s argument that the fight between the angels and demons is equal, objecting that they, as demons, can feel pain, which will break their morale. According to Milton scholar Roy Flannagan, Milton may have chosen to portray Nisroch as timid because he had consulted the Hebrew dictionary of C. Stephanus, which defined the name &quot;Nisroch&quot; as &quot;Flight&quot; or &quot;Delicate Temptation&quot;.

In the 1840s, the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard uncovered numerous stone carvings of winged, eagle-headed genii at Kalhu. Remembering the Biblical story of Sennacherib&#x27;s murder, Layard mistakenly identified these figures as &quot;Nisrochs&quot;. Such carvings continued to be known as &quot;Nisrochs&quot; in popular literature throughout the remaining portion of the nineteenth century. In Edith Nesbit&#x27;s classic 1906 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot;, the child protagonists summon an eagle-headed &quot;Nisroch&quot; to guide them. Nisroch opens a portal and advises them, &quot;Walk forward without fear&quot; and asks, &quot;Is there aught else that the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?&quot; Some modern works on art history still repeat the old misidentification, but Near Eastern scholars now generally refer to the &quot;Nisroch&quot; figure as a &quot;griffin-demon&quot;.

<doc id="633515" wikidata="Q7915743" url="?curid=633515" title="Variable universal life insurance">
<text>Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The &#x27;variable&#x27; component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The &#x27;universal&#x27; component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium).

Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies at any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy. With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100). This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life. With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out. Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years. However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase &quot;paid up additions&quot; to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time.

If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company, a higher rate of return can occur than the fixed rates of return typical for the whole life. The combination over the years of no endowment age, continually increasing death benefit, and if a high rate of return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy; this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums.

== Regulation of VUL providers ==

Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative providing a VUL must be working in accordance with the securities regulations of the country or province in which he operates. And because they are life insurance policies, VULs may only be sold by representatives who are properly licensed to sell life insurance in the areas in which they operate. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed as an &quot;insurer.&quot;

This dual regulation helps protect consumers, who can look up the track record of offenses of any provider listed by the regulating SRO (self-regulatory organization) or provincial securities commission.

#United States. VULs may only be sold in the United States by representatives who have a &quot;producers&quot; life insurance license in the state(s) in which they operate. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed in the state(s) as an &quot;insurer.&quot; Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative must be working through a broker/dealer registered with the United States&#x27; SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and himself be registered with FINRA. (FINRA has an online database an investor can use to look up offenses and regulatory actions of any broker or broker/dealer.) The fact of a representative&#x27;s securities registration will show on his state insurance license as &quot;Variable&quot; as in &quot;qualified for Life and Variable Products.&quot; (The exact wording could vary from state to state.)
#Canada. VULs, as life insurance policies, may only be sold in Canada by life insurance-licensed representatives registered with the insurance regulator in their provincial jurisdiction. Representatives must comply with the life insurance regulations of their respective province (typically, a provincial &quot;Insurance Act&quot;). And, as VULs are life insurance policies, providers must comply with the national life insurance regulations (&quot;Insurance Companies Act&quot;) established by The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). Since VULs are presently not considered to be securities in Canada, they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products. In Canada, there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal life.

== Uses ==
Variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the United States Internal Revenue Code. The cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force. The tax-free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy. See the &#x27;Tax Benefits&#x27; section for more.

In one theory of life insurance, needs based analysis, life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents. In one form of variable universal life insurance, the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value (defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer). Therefore, the greater the cash value accumulation, the lesser the net amount at risk, and the less insurance that is purchased.

Another use of Variable Universal Life Insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into VUL policies under the gift tax exemption. Very often persons in the United States with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed. Often this is done within a VUL policy because this allows a tax deferral (for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational IRA or 529 plan), provides for permanent life insurance, and can usually be accessed tax-free by borrowing against the policy.

==Contract features==

By allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk, and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return. If the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing (ceasing to exist as a valid policy). To avoid this, many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid.

==Premium flexibility==

VUL policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit. The minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer. To maintain a death benefit guarantee, that specified premium level must be paid every month. To keep the policy in force, typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that month&#x27;s cost of insurance. The maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance. Internal Revenue Code section 7702 sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid (both in a given year, and over certain periods of time) for a given death benefit. The most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit. Then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value. In the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component, and was entirely cash value. If it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter, pure investment returns, and no insurance cost. In fact, when variable universal life policies first became available in 1986, contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits. In order to curb this practice, but still encourage life insurance purchase, the IRS developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit.

===Maximum premiums===

The standard set was twofold: to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit. If the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a MEC. A MEC still receives tax free investment returns, and a tax free death benefit, but withdrawals of cash value in a MEC are on a &#x27;LIFO&#x27; basis, where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit, the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded. In order to avoid this, contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet IRS guidelines. The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit. The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.

The maximum premiums are set by the IRS guidelines such that the premiums paid within a seven-year period after a qualifying event (such as purchase or death benefit increase), grown at a 6% rate, and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract, would endow the policy at age 100 (i.e. the cash value would equal the death benefit). More specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a seven-year period. The entire maximum premium (greater than the 7 year premium) can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased. If the 7 year level guideline premium is exceeded, then the policy becomes a MEC.

To add more confusion the seven-year MEC premium level cannot be paid in a VUL every year for 7 years, and still avoid MEC status. The MEC premium level can only be paid in practice for about 4 years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non MEC status is desired. There is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force. This premium carries different names from different insurers, one calling it the guideline maximum premium. This is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy.

==Investment choices==

The number and type of choices available vary from company to company, and from policy to policy. The current generation of VUL policies have a wide variety of sub-accounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into. These newer policies often offer 50 or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles.

Separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds, and are so named because they are kept &#x27;separate&#x27; from the &#x27;general account&#x27; of the life insurance company. They are similar to mutual funds, but have different regulatory requirements.

==Tax advantages==

*Tax-deferred growth of cash surrender values while a policy is in force
*FIFO withdrawal status on premiums paid into the contract
*Income tax-free policy loans from policies that are not Modified Endowment Contracts
*Income tax-free death benefits (may be subject to estate tax if policy is owned by the insured)

Taxes are the main reason those in higher tax brackets (25%+) would desire to use a VUL over any other accumulation strategy. For someone in a 34% tax bracket (Federal &amp; State), the investment return on the separate accounts may average 10%, and at say age 75 the policy&#x27;s death benefit would have an internal rate of return of 9%. In order to get a 9% rate of return in an ordinary taxable account, in a 34% tax bracket, one must earn 13.64%. An alternative for this in the 34% tax bracket would be to consider using Variable Annuities which does not limit the contributions and withdraw from it without annuitizing the contract.

Other alternatives for those in the 34% tax bracket that own their own companies would be to consider SEP IRAs, company 401ks, or retirement arrangements from a company perspective, or to incorporate and consult a tax specialist.

These numbers assume expenses that may vary from company to company, and it is assumed that the VUL is funded with a minimum face value for the level of premium. The cash values would also be available to fund lifestyle or personally managed investments on a tax-free basis in the form of refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans (which would be paid off on death by the death benefit.)

==Risks of variable universal life==

*Cost of insurance - the cost of insurance for VULs is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages, the risk of mortality increases, increasing the cost of insurance. If not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings. If this continues long-term the savings will be depleted and the insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance, or very expensive insurance.
*Cash outlay - the cash needed to effectively use a VUL is generally much higher than other types of insurance policies. If a policy does not have the right amount of funding, it may lapse.
*Investment risk - because the subaccounts in the VUL may be invested in stocks and bonds, the insured now take on the investment risk rather than the insurance company. The loss and gain of the investment fund mainly depend on the stock market flow.
*Complexity - the VUL is a complex product, and can easily be used (or sold) inappropriately because of this. Proper funding, investing, and planning are usually required in order for the VUL to work as expected.

==General uses of variable universal life==

These are the features typically marketed by insurance companies, however, the VUL in most cases will limit the insured to being able to take advantage of only one of these features listed. Each of these features can be achieved through other means.

*Financial protection - as with all life insurance programs, VULs can be used to protect a family in the case of premature death.
*Tax advantages - because of its tax-deferred feature, the VUL may offer an attractive tax advantage, especially to those in higher tax brackets. To attain them, the policy must be highly funded (though still non-MEC), for the tax advantages to offset the cost of insurance. These tax advantages can be used for either...
**Education planning - the cash value of a VUL can be used to help fund children&#x27;s education, as long as the policy is started very early. Also, putting money into a VUL can be used to help children qualify for federal financial aid, since the federal government does not consider the cash value when calculating EFC (Expected Family Contribution).
**Retirement planning - because of its tax-free policy loan feature, the VUL can also be used as a tax-advantaged income source in retirement, assuming retirement is not in the near future and the policy is not a modified endowment contract. Again, the policy must be properly funded for this strategy to work.
*Estate planning - those with a large estate (A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $5,430,000 effective for decedents dying on or after January 1, 2015) can sometimes use a VUL as part of their estate planning strategy to reduce or avoid estate taxes by setting up a life insurance trust sometimes known as an ILIT.

==Criticisms of variable universal life==

Some general criticisms

*Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a &quot;reverse dollar cost averaging&quot; effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.
*Some older VUL policies have limited sub-account choices. This issue has been greatly corrected with the current generation of policies having 50 or more sub-accounts that cover all the major asset classes, with more than one sub-account manager.
*Policy administrative expenses and costs of insurance may increase at the company&#x27;s whim, subject to a contractual maximum.
*VUL is relatively complex compared to traditional Whole Life or Term Life.

Some criticism is not about the product, but rather the sales tactics used by some insurance agents.

*Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

Some regulators are criticized, as well.

* The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) does not allow insurance companies to illustrate VUL policies using a stochastic projection (commonly called a &#x27;Monte Carlo Simulation&#x27;), limiting agents to use &#x27;straight line&#x27;, constant interest assumptions.

<text>In information technology, a Christmas tree packet (also known as a kamikaze packet, nastygram, or lamp test segment) is a network message segment or packet with every option enabled for the particular network protocol in use.

==Background==
Network packets contain a number of flags or options depending on the type of network protocol in use. Enabling options can elicit specific behaviors in the device receiving the packet and differences in the responses to the packets. By analyzing those differences, Christmas tree packets can be used as a method of TCP/IP stack fingerprinting, exposing the underlying nature of a TCP/IP stack by sending the packets and then awaiting and analyzing the responses. When used as part of scanning a system, the TCP header of a Christmas tree packet has the flags FIN, URG and PSH set. Many operating systems implement their compliance with the Internet Protocol standards in varying or incomplete ways. By observing how a host responds to an odd packet, such as a Christmas tree packet, inferences can be made regarding the host&#x27;s operating system. Versions of Microsoft Windows, BSD/OS, HP-UX, Cisco IOS, MVS, and IRIX display behaviors that differ from the RFC standard when queried with said packets. 

A large number of Christmas tree packets can also be used to conduct a DoS attack by exploiting the fact that Christmas tree packets require much more processing by routers and end-hosts than the &quot;usual&quot; packets do.

Christmas tree packets can be easily detected by intrusion-detection systems or more advanced firewalls. From a network security point of view, Christmas tree packets are always suspicious and indicate a high probability of network reconnaissance activities.

<text>George Mercer Dawson (August 1, 1849 – March 2, 1901) was a Canadian geologist and surveyor. He performed many early explorations in western North America and compiled numerous records of the native peoples.

== Biography ==
He was born in Pictou, Nova Scotia, the eldest son of Sir John William Dawson, Principal of McGill University and a noted geologist, and his wife, Lady Margaret Dawson. By age 11, he was afflicted with tuberculosis of the spine (Pott&#x27;s disease) that resulted in a deformed back and stunted growth. Physical limitations, however, did not deter Dawson from becoming one of Canada&#x27;s greatest scientists.

Tutors and his father provided his education during his slow recovery from the illness. Dawson later attended the High School of Montreal and McGill University (part-time) before moving to London to study geology and paleontology at the Royal School of Mines (now part of Imperial College London) in 1869. Dawson graduated after three years with the highest marks in his class.

Dawson began his career in the 1870s as a professor of chemistry at Morrin College in Quebec City. From 1873 to 1875, he worked for the British North American Boundary Commission surveying the International Boundary. The result was the 387-page &quot;Report on the Geology and Resources of the Region in the Vicinity of the Forty-Ninth parallel from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains&quot;, which established Dawson&#x27;s reputation as a respected scientist.

Dawson joined the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) in 1875 and led many field parties in Canada&#x27;s north and west. His work is credited as having laid the foundations of much of our knowledge of the geology and natural history of those regions. For example, during 1883 and 1884, Dawson travelled through the Canadian Rockies, where he mapped out the major mountains, mountain passes, and rivers. Some of the many peaks he charted were Mount Assiniboine, , and Mount Temple, . As a result of his field research, a map of his work was published in 1886 covering the Canadian Rockies from the US border to the Red Deer River Valley and Kicking Horse Pass.

In addition to his geological work, Dawson was keenly interested in the languages and cultures of the First Nations peoples he met in his travels. While studying the coal deposits of the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii) in 1878, he prepared a comprehensive report on the Haida people, which included a vocabulary of their language. His photographs of Haida villages and totem poles remain a treasured and unique record. He also published papers about the Indigenous peoples of the Yukon and northern British Columbia, the Kwakiutl people of Vancouver Island and the Shuswap people of central British Columbia.

The field season of 1887 saw Dawson and his assistant R.G. McConnell exploring northern British Columbia and the headwaters of the Yukon River, during which they made an arduous circuit by separate routes, on foot and by boat, of an area of , which had been previously unknown except for First Nations accounts and those of a few prospectors. The results of the work included some of the first maps of the Yukon. His report was republished ten years later to satisfy interest in the region as a result of the Klondike Gold Rush. Dawson City, Yukon, was named in his honour, as was Dawson Creek, British Columbia.

In 1898, Dawson lead a field expedition with the intent of surveying resources, along with the famed anarchist, Peter Kropotkin, who was awed by the skill that he saw in Dawson and wrote that he knew &quot;the Rocky Mountains and the coast ranges as his own garden.&quot;

Dawson became assistant director of the GSC in 1883 and was appointed its third director in 1895. Under his leadership, the GSC continued its far-flung expeditions to study all aspects of Canada&#x27;s geology and natural history. Reflecting Dawson&#x27;s interest in ethnology, the GSC&#x27;s museum increased its indigenous collections, and these formed the basis of what is now the Canadian Museum of History. He also lobbied the government tirelessly to secure funding for a more suitable building to house the GSC&#x27;s museum and scientific staff. This funding was granted just one month before his unexpected death in Ottawa on March 2, 1901, after a one-day bout with acute bronchitis. He was interred in the family plot in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. The building that resulted from his efforts was the Victoria Memorial Museum Building.

== Honours ==
Dawson received an LL.D. from Queen&#x27;s University in 1890 and from McGill University in 1891. In 1891, Dawson was also named a fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1892, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

He was president of the Geological Society of America in 1900, just seven years after his father served in the same role.

<text>The Contender is a 2000 American political drama film written and directed by Rod Lurie. It stars Gary Oldman, Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges and Christian Slater. The film focuses on a fictional United States president (played by Bridges) and the events surrounding his appointment of a new vice president (Allen).

The film serves as a response to the Lewinsky scandal involving President Bill Clinton. It became the subject of controversy regarding alterations that displeased Oldman, who co-produced. The film enjoyed box office success in the US. The film also received two Academy Award nominations; Joan Allen was nominated for Best Actress and Jeff Bridges for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Second-term Democratic U.S. President Jackson Evans must select a new Vice President following the sudden death of his vice president, Troy Ellard. The obvious choice seems to be Virginia Governor Jack Hathaway, who is hailed as a hero after he recently dove into a lake in a failed attempt to save a drowning girl. The President instead decides that his &quot;swan song&quot; will be helping to break the glass ceiling by nominating Ohio Senator Laine Hanson. In accordance with the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, approval from both houses of Congress is required. Standing in her way is Republican Congressman Sheldon Runyon of Illinois, who believes she is unqualified for the position, and backs Hathaway for the nod. His investigation into her background turns up an incident where she was apparently photographed participating in a drunken orgy as part of a sorority initiation. He is joined in his opposition by Democratic Representative Reginald Webster.

The confirmation hearings begin in Washington, D.C., and Runyon, who chairs the committee, quickly addresses Hanson&#x27;s alleged sexual imbroglio. Hanson refuses to address the incident, neither confirming nor denying anything, and tries to turn the discussion towards political issues. Anticipating that Hanson would deem her personal past &quot;none of anyone&#x27;s business&quot;, Runyon starts rumors in the media saying that the sexual escapade in college was done in exchange for money and favors, making it prostitution.

Hanson meets with Evans and offers to withdraw her name, to save his administration more embarrassment. Despite the wishes of the administration, she refuses to fight back or even address Runyon&#x27;s charges, arguing that to answer the questions dignifies them being asked in the first place—something she does not believe. Evans meets with Runyon, informing him he will not choose Hanson as vice president. Runyon casually brings forward Hathaway as a replacement. They make an agreement that Runyon will back down on his attacks if Evans chooses Hathaway as vice president. However, Evans requests Runyon to make a public statement defending Hathaway, which Runyon agrees to do.

Hanson, Hathaway, and Runyon are all invited to the White House. Evans then shocks them with an FBI report revealing that Hathaway paid the woman to drive off the bridge. Hathaway is arrested and Runyon is disgraced because he vouched for Hathaway&#x27;s integrity just hours earlier. Evans meets with Hanson, and she finally tells what actually happened that night in college. She said that she did indeed arrive at a fraternity house to have sex with two men as part of an initiation, but changed her mind before any sex occurred. However, she did not prove her innocence, citing that by doing so will further the idea that it was acceptable to ask the questions in the first place. Evans addresses Congress, where he chastises all Democrats and Republicans who blocked Hanson&#x27;s confirmation. He explicitly lambasts Runyon, who leaves in humiliation. Although he declares that Hanson had asked for her nomination to be withdrawn so he could finish his presidency with triumph over controversy, he remains adamant by rejecting her resignation and calls for an immediate confirmation vote.

==Cast==


==Production==

===Development===
Director Rod Lurie said he wrote the screenplay because he wished to make a film starring Joan Allen, and wrote the part of Laine Hanson with her in mind. Having a fascination with politics, and inspired by his daughter, he wished to make a feminist film that would differ from Allen&#x27;s frequent role as troubled wife. At the time, the Lewinsky scandal was in the news, and actor Jeff Bridges acknowledged the story was a response to it. In writing the screenplay, Lurie considered a number of possible endings, including one in which Laine is assassinated. However, he wanted to give a message of hope to his daughter and audiences.

Actor Gary Oldman decided to produce the film, attracted to the screenplay which he felt was reminiscent of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976). He did not see Sheldon Runyon as a villain, and Lurie claimed he was not written to be one. Oldman&#x27;s manager Douglas Urbanski noted they independently produced the film before DreamWorks became involved.

===Casting===
Before approaching Jeff Bridges for the part of President Evans, Lurie submitted the screenplay to Paul Newman, reflecting how the character was envisioned to be older than he is in the final film. Newman turned down the role, which Lurie attributed to the actor&#x27;s retirement. Bridges also sings the song featured in the beginning of the film.

Lurie wanted Sam Elliott for the part of Kermit, despite skepticism that he was best known for playing cowboys. Christian Slater joined the cast, saying he was interested in the screenplay&#x27;s discussion of principles.

===Filming===
The scene where Laine is interviewed by Larry King was shot before principal photography. False gravestones were made for a set recreating Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, with many of the markers having the same name, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave permission for shooting in their office for one scene.

A number of scenes were filmed during rain, but this precipitation does not appear in the film because a severe amount is needed to be visible. In one such scene, before Laine is announced as vice presidential nominee, a typhoon was forecast, and Lurie&#x27;s assistant from India performed a religious ritual to ward it off, which the director credited with working. The scene where Laine debates abortion with the House Judiciary Committee is directly influenced by &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962).

In the scene where Allen is riding by supporters in a car, few extras attended the shot, which lasted only 15 minutes. As a result, a number of crew members were costumed and stood in.

===Post-production===
After the film was nearly completed, Lurie received a phone call saying producer Steven Spielberg was interested in the project. Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks eventually paid $9 million to acquire the film&#x27;s domestic distribution rights. Lurie and Allen said it was the first time DreamWorks acquired a film the company had not produced.

Lurie said nearly 30 minutes of footage was deleted because it did not reflect intended themes of principles and leadership. Based on lack of enthusiasm in test screenings to the final scene where Laine addresses the House Judiciary Committee, and with Spielberg&#x27;s advice, Lurie added music intended to be inspirational, which did receive a better response from test audiences.

==Release==
The film was screened in Toronto International Film Festival in September 2000, and premiered in Los Angeles on 6 October. After a wider release on 13 October, it generated over $5 million during its opening weekend.

The film finished its run with a total domestic gross of $17,872,723, which was seen by domestic distributor DreamWorks as a box office success. It earned $22,361,811 worldwide.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Contender&quot; holds an overall approval rating of 76% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Contender&quot; wears its political heart on its sleeve, but strong performances and a solid screenplay help the end result add up to a gripping drama from either side of the aisle&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, calling it &quot;one of those rare movies where you leave the theater having been surprised and entertained, and then start arguing&quot;. Emanuel Levy wrote in &quot;Variety&quot; that Lurie was improving as a director and screenwriter, but the film was &quot;too obvious and verbose&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film a B− in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, saying Bridges emulated Bill Clinton in &quot;charisma, charm, appetite&quot;, and that &quot;&quot;The Contender&quot; booms and pontificates, full of bravado and that ineffable quality of the current political season, chutzpah&quot;, but &quot;only pretends to be enlightened, liberal&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers called the film &quot;a lively, entertaining ride&quot; before descending into partisanship. In &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, Michael Wilmington called it &quot;a smart, tense political drama about presidential politics&quot;. Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised Allen and Bridges. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;As entertainment of a tawdry but compelling sort, &quot;The Contender&quot; certainly delivers&quot;, but found Allen&#x27;s character uninspiring.

In 2003, critic J. Hoberman assessed the film to be a feminist attack on double standards, in which &quot;unbridled female sexuality&quot; is perceived as a threat to the system. Hoberman concluded then-Senator Hillary Clinton was more the contender than 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore, and that the film was &quot;a prophecy of 2004&quot;. Author Harry Keyishian wrote the ending, in which it appears Laine will be confirmed despite her civic religion, is unrealistic, and &quot;swelling music replaces logic and probability&quot;. M. Keith Booker called it &quot;a surprisingly complex film&quot;, in which Runyon is a villain who stands by his principles, while Evans is heroic despite being &quot;a savvy politician&quot;, a harder man than what the public sees. In 2009, Gary Susman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Evans as one of the 10 greatest fictional presidents.

After viewing &quot;The Contender&quot;, actor Dustin Hoffman placed a telephone call to Oldman to commend his work in the film.

===Controversy===

The film has also been the subject of controversy. In an October 2000 issue of &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine, Oldman supposedly alleged that editing cuts were made due to the studio&#x27;s Democratic leanings. Oldman and his co-producer, Urbanski, reportedly accused the DreamWorks studio and director Rod Lurie of editing the original film to make it more Democrat-biased, mainly by making the Runyon character less sympathetic than was originally intended.

However, Oldman stated in other interviews that his criticisms were only directed at Lurie and that the quote was &quot;bastardized, kinda&quot; when reprinted on Internet sources. He went on to complain that his issue with the film was how it became progressively less &quot;ambiguous&quot; as the editing went on, specifically citing the music as a problem in turning it into a film about &quot;good guys and bad guys&quot;. Roger Ebert stated that Oldman&#x27;s denunciation of the film never happened, and quoted Urbanski as saying Oldman is &quot;the least political person I know&quot; and taking credit for producing the film independently from DreamWorks, which eventually adopted it.

<text>Boston Market Corporation, known as Boston Chicken until 1995, is an American fast casual restaurant chain headquartered in Newtown Township, Pennsylvania. Since 2020, it has been owned by Engage Brands, LLC, a company of Rohan Group. From 1985 to 1995, Boston Market was known as Boston Chicken, which rapidly expanded to over a thousand locations. By the late 1990s, the chain filed for bankruptcy and closed many stores until a few hundred remained. McDonald&#x27;s purchased the chain in 2000. It was sold again in 2007, then in 2020. As of November 2020, the chain had approximately 342 company-owned restaurant locations in 28 states and Puerto Rico. In the 2020s the chain encountered legal troubles and went into a rapid decline to end 2024 with only 16 remaining stores. At its peak, Boston Market had its greatest presence in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, as well as California, Florida, and Texas.

Boston Market is remembered for helping to popularize rotisserie chickens as well as fast casual dining, which both remain popular nationally. Initially known for rotisserie chicken, and the chain later branched out into other meats including turkey, meatloaf, and ham. A typical Boston Market meal had a protein with a few sides such as potatoes, creamed spinach, or mac &amp; cheese, and was accompanied by a piece of corn bread. Stores sometimes had seasonal specials and also sold sandwiches. Frozen meals and side dishes continued to be sold nationally under the Boston Market brand name in food markets.

==History==
Boston Chicken was founded by Steven Kolow and Arthur Cores in 1985 in Newton, a suburb of Boston. The chain expanded rapidly in the early and mid-1990s. 
When it was known as Boston Chicken, restaurants specialized in rotisserie chicken and a variety of side dishes, but in February 1995, the chain expanded its menu to include turkey, meatloaf, and ham and changed the name to Boston Market in the fall of 1995 to reflect this. The corporate name remained Boston Chicken, Inc. until 1997, when the new name became popular and the corporate name was changed to Boston Market Corporation.

In 1995, Boston Chicken created the Einstein Bros. Bagels chain of bakery cafés, after acquiring several smaller chains of bagel-centric bakeries.

In 1996, the chain launched &quot;Boston Carver Sandwiches&quot;, which featured chicken, turkey, ham, and meatloaf; in 1997, due to the success of the sandwich line, &quot;Extreme Carver&quot; sandwiches, filled with larger portions of meat and cheese, were launched.

The company raised a lot of debt to finance its expansion. The rapid expansion allowed the company to create a steady stream of revenue from one-time development fees and increasing royalties, but also raised interest rates on its development loans. In 1998, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Since April 1999, a selection of Boston Market-branded items have been available in many supermarkets across the United States.

Boston Market was purchased by McDonald&#x27;s Corporation in May 2000, primarily for its real estate holdings. McDonald&#x27;s found the brand serviceable, and continued to operate and expand Boston Market.

In the early 2000s, Boston Market operated two locations in Toronto, Ontario. In early 2002, Boston Market entered the Australian market, opening nine stores in the Sydney metropolitan area by 2004, before converting some stores to McDonald&#x27;s and quietly exiting the Australian market later that year due to competitive pressures.

In April 2004, Boston Market introduced chilled menu items to be sold in supermarkets. In December 2005, these chilled menu items were available in 700 supermarkets.

In 2005, Boston Market also started limited-time offers, such as Crispy Country Chicken, an oven-baked chicken breast with gravy.

In 2007, McDonald&#x27;s announced that it was &quot;exploring strategic options&quot; for the subsidiary. On August 6, 2007, McDonald&#x27;s announced plans to sell the chain to Sun Capital Partners, a transaction that was completed on August 27, 2007.

In 2013, Boston Market opened its first new location in seven years in Florida and in 2015 it added ribs to the menu.
In April 2018, Boston Market announced that it was expanding its menu to offer rotisserie prime rib nationwide, three days a week. In 2019, the chain closed 45 locations, with one report noting competition with rotisserie chickens sold at regular supermarket chains. In 2020, it introduced baby back ribs paired with Sweet Baby Ray&#x27;s sauce.

In April 2020, Sun Capital Partners sold Boston Market to Engage Brands, LLC, a company of Rohan Group, owned by Jignesh &quot;Jay&quot; Pandya. This started a difficult period in which the company stopped paying its suppliers, rent, and some employees. This resulted in over 150 lawsuits. In 2023, New Jersey shut down 27 locations when it was determined employees were owed hundreds of thousands of dollars. The chain started with about 300 locations at the start of 2023, but was down to 79 locations later that year, and by early 2024 there were fewer than 30 locations but the chain opened a new location in India.

In 2023 and beyond, Boston Market experienced financial problems and closed most of its locations.

==Menu==

Menu items offered at Boston Market included various meats and sides, such as rotisserie chicken (whole, half, or quarter), apple pie, carved chicken sandwich, chicken salad sandwich, chicken noodle soup, chicken pot pie, cilantro lime rice, creamed spinach, Cobb salad, cornbread, garlic dill potatoes, mashed potatoes (with gravy), meatloaf and meatloaf sandwich, desserts (salted caramel lava cake, chocolate cake, or chocolate chip cookies), prime rib, ribs (beef, with sauce), steamed vegetables (e.g., broccoli), sweet potato casserole, and turkey (roasted). Many of the chicken items included rotisserie chicken, and the rotisserie oven was also used to cook other meats. Boston Market offered rotisserie nuggets for a time. 
Boston Market also had seasonal holiday menu and catering food packages, such as for Thanksgiving dinner (a traditional U.S. holiday meal), which included items such as a whole rotisserie turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, vegetable stuffing, spinach-artichoke dip, cranberry walnut relish, dinner rolls, and pumpkin and apple pies.

The Boston Market supermarket brand is produced by Bellisio Foods. As of 2024, it continues to produce items such as chicken pot pie bites, mashed potatoes, and chicken fajita rice bowls.

==Trademark dispute and grocery brand==
In 2002, Boston Pizza commenced a lawsuit against Boston Market in the Federal Court of Canada over the trademark use of the word &quot;Boston&quot; in Canada. In its defense, Boston Market alleged that Boston Pizza&#x27;s trademarks were invalid because it described a style of pizza from a specific area. The dispute continued after Boston Market ceased operations in Canada in 2004. The parties settled the dispute in 2008 under an agreement that Boston Market would not use the words &quot;Boston&quot; or &quot;Boston Market&quot; in Canada for five years for restaurants or any food or drink products (other than pre-packaged food products, but not including pizza and lasagna). Boston Market also agreed that it would not challenge Boston Pizza&#x27;s use in Canada of any trademark that uses the words &quot;Boston&quot; or &quot;Boston Pizza&quot; (with certain exceptions).

==Financial problems of 2023-2024==

On July 3, 2023, a complaint was filed stating the Danbury, Connecticut Boston Market owed in excess of $61,000 in unpaid rent and connected charges. A ruling in the landlord&#x27;s favor on July 28, 2023, led to an eviction.

On July 25, 2023, US Foods sued Boston Market for $11.3 million, accusing the company of owing them over $10 million for food distributed over several prior years.

On August 14, 2023, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development issued a stop-work order at 27 of the 31 Boston Market stores in New Jersey over multiple violations of workers rights, including owed backpay of up to $607,471 to up to 314 employees. An investigation on the matter began in November 2022 when an employee in Mercer County filed a complaint. The affected employees have since been reimbursed for their lost wages, and the stores were allowed to re-open a month later.

In September 2023, investigative journalists of Restaurant Business Magazine revealed Pandya had over 200 lawsuits against him related to unpaid wages of employees, unpaid suppliers, and other violations related to his restaurants. The report described Pandya&#x27;s ownership of Boston Market as &quot;chaotic&quot;.

In November 2023, the company failed to pay workers in Massachusetts.

On November 14, 2023, all Detroit-area Boston Market locations were permanently shuttered and were handed eviction notices due to unpaid rent. On November 20, 2023, all 8 remaining Connecticut Boston Market locations, located in East Haven, Meriden, West Hartford, Wilton, Stratford, Milford, Bristol, and Newington, were permanently shuttered and issued eviction notices due to unpaid rent. Boston Market and owner Pandya filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2023.

On January 10, 2024, the company announced that it would allow anyone to open a Boston Market franchise without the usual franchise fees or other buy-in requirements.

On January 11, 2024, Boston Market&#x27;s bankruptcy case was dismissed after the company was unresponsive to court requests. On February 1, 2024, US Foods won its lawsuit against Boston Market, with federal judge Manish Shah claiming that Boston Market&#x27;s defenses in the lawsuit were &quot;gossamer.&quot; On February 12, 2024, shortly after its second bankruptcy was dismissed, Boston Market filed for bankruptcy for the third time after losing the US Foods lawsuit.

<doc id="633533" wikidata="Q288222" url="?curid=633533" title="Bigfin squid">
<text>Bigfin squids are a group of rarely seen cephalopods with a distinctive morphology. They are placed in the genus Magnapinna and family Magnapinnidae. Although the family was described only from larval, paralarval, and juvenile specimens, numerous video observations of much larger squid with similar morphology are assumed to be adult specimens of the same family.

The arms and tentacles of the squid are both extremely long, estimated at . These appendages are held perpendicular to the body, creating &quot;elbows&quot;. How the squid feeds is yet to be discovered.

&quot;Magnapinna&quot; is thought to be the deepest-occurring squid genus, with sightings as deep as below the surface, making it the only squid known to inhabit the hadal zone.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Magnapinna&quot; is the sister group to &quot;Joubiniteuthis&quot;, another little-known deep-sea squid with an unusual body plan and long arms. Both &quot;Magnapinna&quot; and &quot;Joubiniteuthis&quot; are monotypic genera within their own families, Magnapinnidae and Joubiniteuthidae respectively. They are also closely related to the &quot;whip-lash squid&quot; in the families Chiroteuthidae and Mastigoteuthidae.&quot;&quot;

== Physical specimens ==

The first record of this family comes from a specimen (&quot;Magnapinna talismani&quot;) caught off the Azores on 10 August 1883. Due to the damaged nature of the find, little information could be discerned, and it was classified as a mastigoteuthid, first as &quot;Chiroteuthopsis talismani&quot; and later as &quot;Mastigoteuthis talismani&quot;. In 1956, a similar squid (&quot;Magnapinna&quot; sp. C) was caught in the South Atlantic, but little was thought of it at the time. The specimen was illustrated in Alister Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Open Sea&quot; (1956), where it was identified as &quot;Octopodoteuthis sicula&quot;.

During the 1980s, two additional immature specimens were found in the Atlantic (&quot;Magnapinna&quot; sp. A), and three more were found in the Pacific (&quot;Magnapinna pacifica&quot;). Researchers Michael Vecchione and Richard Young were the chief investigators of the finds, and eventually linked them to the two previous specimens, erecting the family Magnapinnidae in 1998, with &quot;Magnapinna pacifica&quot; as the type species. Of particular interest was the very large fin size, up to 90% of the mantle length, that was responsible for the animals&#x27; common name.

A single specimen of a fifth species, &quot;Magnapinna&quot; sp. B, was collected in 2006. &quot;Magnapinna&quot; sp. A was described as &quot;Magnapinna atlantica&quot; in 2006.

The genus was described from two juveniles and paralarva, none of which had developed the characteristic long arm tips. However, they did all have large fins, and were therefore named &quot;magna pinna&quot;, meaning &quot;big fin&quot;.
== Sightings ==
The presumed adult stage of &quot;Magnapinna&quot; is known only from video observations from submersibles and remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs); no physical specimens have yet been collected, leaving their exact identity unknown. These individuals and the collected juvenile specimens share the very large fins and the vermiform arm tips with no suckers, but the iconic elongated arm tips are known only from observed individuals. Although it has not been directly confirmed whether these squid are the same as the &quot;Magnapinna&quot; known from specimens, it is largely accepted that they are members of Magnapinnidae.

Although observations had been made over a decade earlier, adult bigfin squid only became known to science in 2001, when marine biology student Heather Holston sent footage of what she described as a &quot;21-foot-long squid&quot; to teuthologist Michael Vecchione. The footage had been recorded from an ROV in the Gulf of Mexico in January 2000 at the request of Holston&#x27;s boyfriend Eric Leveton, who planned on showing it to her. Leveton was a structural engineer aboard the oil-drilling ship &quot;Millennium Explorer&quot;, who had happened to look into the ROV operation shack when the squid was observed by operators. Although Vecchione initially surmised from Holston&#x27;s description that the footage might be the first video of a live giant squid (&quot;Architeuthis dux&quot;), he realized that the video itself portrayed a completely different squid that had no known identity.

Further discussions with other cephalopod researchers found no leads on the identity of the squid, and it was thus dubbed the &quot;mystery squid&quot; for a portion of time. Analysis by Vecchione &quot;et al&quot; of previous footage from submersibles found other video records of bigfin squid, the earliest from 1988. Around the same time, new high-quality footage of a bigfin squid was also recorded off Hawaii by the ROV Tiburon. In December 2001, Vecchione &quot;et al&quot; published a paper collating these observations; this was also the first paper to identify them as potential members of the Magnapinnidae, which had been named by Vecchione from the juvenile specimens a few years earlier. Independent of Vecchione&#x27;s publication, Guerra &quot;et al&quot; published a paper the following year analyzing some of the early bigfin squid footage, and also identified them as potential adult magnapinnids.

=== Anatomy ===
The specimens in the videos looked very distinct from all previously known squids. Uniquely among cephalopods, the arms and tentacles were of the same length and looked identical (similar to extinct belemnites). The appendages were also held perpendicular to the body, creating the appearance of strange &quot;elbows&quot;. Most remarkable was the length of the elastic tentacles, which has been estimated at up to 15–20 times the mantle length. This trait is caused by filament coiling of the tentacles, a trait that is rare among similar species. Estimates based on video evidence put the total length of the largest specimens at or more, with some estimates up to . Viewing close-ups of the body and head, it is apparent that the fins are extremely large, being proportionately nearly as big as those of bigfin squid larvae. While they do appear similar to the larvae, no specimens or samples of the adults have been taken. While their exact identity is unknown, all of the discovered specimens can be observed to have a brown-orange color body, translucent fins, near-white tentacles, and dark eyes. These species of squids are mainly identifiable by their long thin arms and specific colors. The squid also have a very unique brachial crown that sets them aside from the rest of other families that are known.

=== Feeding behaviour ===
Little is known about the feeding-behaviour of these squids. Scientists have speculated that the bigfin squid feeds by dragging their arms and tentacles along the seafloor and grabbing edible organisms from the floor. Alternatively, they may simply use a trapping technique, waiting passively for prey such as zooplankton to bump into their arms (see Cephalopod intelligence). The diet of the bigfin squid is unknown. However, cephalopods are known to feed on crustaceans, jellyfish, and even other cephalopods.

=== Observation timeline ===
The first visual record of an adult bigfin squid was in September 1988. The crew of the submersible &quot;Nautile&quot; encountered a bigfin squid off the coast of northern Brazil, , at a depth of . In July 1992, the &quot;Nautile&quot; again encountered these creatures, observing two individuals during a dive off the coast of Ghana at , first at depth, and then again at . Both were filmed and photographed. In November 1998, the Japanese crewed submersible &quot;Shinkai 6500&quot; filmed another bigfin squid in the Indian Ocean south of Mauritius, at and .

Eric Leveton&#x27;s video, which was later shared with Vecchione, was taken from the remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) of the oil-drilling ship &quot;Millennium Explorer&quot; in January 2000, at Mississippi Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico () at , and allowed for a size estimate. By comparison with the visible parts of the ROV, the squid was estimated to measure with arms fully extended. The &quot;Nautile&quot; filmed another Indian Ocean specimen at and , in the area of Rodrigues Island, in May 2000. In October 2000, the crewed submersible &quot;Alvin&quot; found another bigfin squid at in , Gulf of Mexico ().

These videos did not receive any media attention; most were brief and fairly blurry. In May 2001, approximately ten minutes of crisp footage of a bigfin squid were acquired by ROV &quot;Tiburon&quot;, causing a flurry of attention when released. These were taken in the Pacific Ocean north of Oʻahu, Hawaii (), at . This video and the pre-2001 videos (which had not previously received much scientific attention) were documented by Vecchione &quot;et al&quot; in a paper that year, and some of the earlier footage was further analyzed by Guerra &quot;et al&quot; (2002).

On 11 November 2007, a bigfin squid was filmed off Perdido, a drilling-site owned by Shell Oil Company, located off Houston, Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. The ROV that filmed the squid had originally been sent to retrieve drilling equipment from the seabed, and encountered the squid floating near a well. After being circulated within the oil industry, the footage was shared with &quot;National Geographic News&quot; to have its identity determined, and was released to the public in 2008. This video received significant online attention in the years since its filming.

Observations of bigfin squid were made in the Great Australian Bight during towed camera and remote operated vehicle surveys in 2015 and 2017 respectively. In 2018, the first observations of a bigfin squid were made from the Southern Caribbean, off the coast of Colombia.

In March 2021, during the expedition to document the wreck of the USS Johnston, the submersible DSV &quot;Limiting Factor&quot; recorded footage of a juvenile bigfin squid from the Philippine Trench at a depth of . This is the deepest observation of any squid, and rivalled only by some unidentified cirrate octopods from the same habitat as the deepest observation of any cephalopod. This makes &quot;Magnapinna&quot; the first squid known to inhabit the hadal zone.

On 9 November 2021, a video of a bigfin squid was captured at a ridge feature off the West Florida Escarpment by an ROV from the NOAAS &quot;Okeanos Explorer&quot; as part of the Windows to the Deep 2021 expedition. The squid was found at a depth of , and its size is currently being measured using paired lasers.

ROV SuBastian of Schmidt Ocean Institute observed a bigfin squid in close proximity to a black smoker-type hydrothermal vent on 4 April 2023, during the &quot;In Search of Hydrothermal Lost Cities&quot; expedition. The squid was seen at a depth of .

<text>Sergei Prokofiev wrote his Symphony No. 2 in D minor, Op. 40, in Paris in 1924-25, during what he called &quot;nine months of frenzied toil&quot;. He characterized this symphony as a work of &quot;iron and steel&quot;.

== Structure ==
Prokofiev modeled the symphony&#x27;s structure on Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s last piano sonata (Op. 111): a tempestuous minor-key first movement followed by a set of variations. The first movement, in traditional sonata form, is rhythmically unrelenting, harmonically dissonant, and texturally thick. The second movement, twice as long as the first, comprises a set of variations on a plaintive, diatonic theme played on the oboe, which provides strong contrast to the defiant coda of the first movement. The subsequent variations contrast moments of beautiful meditation with cheeky playfulness, yet the tension of the first movement is never far away and contributes an ongoing sense of unease. The last variation integrates the theme with the violence of the first movement, reaching an inevitable climax. The symphony ends with a touching restatement of the initial oboe theme, eventually dispelled by an eerie chord on the strings.

==Premiere and public reaction ==
The piece was premiered in Paris on June 6, 1925, conducted by its dedicatee Serge Koussevitzky, and was not well received. After the premiere, Prokofiev commented that neither he nor the audience understood the piece. In a letter to Nikolai Myaskovsky, Prokofiev wrote:

I have made the music so complex to such an extent that when I listen to it myself I do not fathom its essence, so what can I ask of others?

Prokofiev later said that this symphony led him to have doubts about his ability as a composer for the first time in his life.

Prokofiev intended to reconstruct the piece in three movements, going so far as to assign the project the opus number 136, but the composer died before he could undertake the revisions. The symphony, little-known and rarely performed, remains among the least-played of Prokofiev&#x27;s works. Despite the negative criticism, the contemporary composer Christopher Rouse called it &quot;the best of all of them&quot; in regards to Prokofiev&#x27;s work, and composed his own Symphony No. 3 in homage to the piece.

<doc id="633544" wikidata="Q1467531" url="?curid=633544" title="Aces of the Deep">
<text>Aces of the Deep is a World War II submarine simulator game developed by Dynamix for MS-DOS in 1994. The game was re-released by Sierra On-Line for Windows in 1995 as Command: Aces of the Deep. &quot;Aces of the Deep&quot; was the last installment of Dynamix&#x27;s &quot;Aces&quot; series, which included the flight simulators &quot;Red Baron&quot;, &quot;Aces of the Pacific&quot;, and &quot;Aces Over Europe&quot;. However, unlike its predecessors, &quot;Aces of the Deep&quot; simulates a Kriegsmarine U-boat during World War II.

A unique feature was that &quot;Aces of the Deep&quot; came with a realistic Kriegsmarine War Grid map in which the player used in reference to finding their patrol zones. There is also an extensive in-game manual that covers the development of the U-boat, time-line based maps that show kill-to-loss ratios, and, on the CD-ROM version, video interviews with former German U-boat captains.

==Gameplay==
The game includes single mission mode, where the player can choose to attack a convoy, a taskforce of warships (consisting of cruisers and/or battleships), or a carrier task-force in a variety of conditions. There are also several historical missions where the player can replay the role of some of Germany&#x27;s greatest U-boat captains.

Alongside the single missions, &quot;Aces of the Deep&quot; includes a single player Career Mode where the player can choose which year of the war he wants to start his career, up until the end of the war. Career features the &quot;Nightclub&quot; for war news, scuttlebutt, and viewing the tonnage board. Within the Career Mode the player can receive promotions, medals, and opportunities to take command of newer U-boats. There are three models of U-boats in several variations for the player to choose from, each of which becomes available during its historical period.

The game includes a rich variety of ships, ranging from oil tankers and merchant ships to large troop ships, several different escorts such as corvettes, frigates and destroyers, and warships such as cruisers, battleships and carriers. It also includes a variety of aircraft on anti-submarine patrols. All these vessels are historically based, and their appearance in the game coincides with their historical appearance on the battlefield. The tactics and weapons used by the ships within the game are also historically based.

&quot;Command: Aces of the Deep&quot; updated the graphics to a higher resolution. This re-release also integrated an expansion that brought in the Type XXI and Type XXIII U-boats.

==Expansions==

An expansion package for either the floppy or CD versions of Aces of the Deep adds brand new missions, areas and a special prototype XXI U-boat submarine.

Some of the more interesting features are the six new historical missions as well as the ability to enter (but possibly not leave due to currents) the Mediterranean Sea. Also included are buoyancy gauges which allows a quicker reading of your depth in the ocean. Most amazing is the prototype Type XXI U-boat, which includes sonar and radar abilities as well as two kinds of torpedo types for its exclusive use.

==Re-releases==

In 1995, there also was an updated Windows version released on CD-ROM called Command: Aces of the Deep. While the gameplay is unchanged it adds new textures, voice acting and video interviews with German submariners. It also added the option, with a compatible sound card &amp; microphone, to use voice control for certain submarine actions, like dive and fire, which is why the game received the expanded title. An on-line manual gives detailed information about the historical background and submarine tactics. It also features historical maps, movies, photos and articles.

==Reception==

In 1996 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked &quot;Aces of the Deep&quot; as the 71st best game of all time, calling it &quot;still unrivaled for creating an authentic atmosphere.&quot;

<text>The piece of music once known as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in B major, K. 17, is now considered to be not by him, but by possibly his father, Leopold Mozart. This symphony has been given the number Anhang C 11.02 in the sixth edition of Ludwig Ritter von Köchel&#x27;s catalogue of Mozart&#x27;s music, and is now also catalogued as Eisen B 6 (LMV VII:B6) in Cliff Eisen&#x27;s catalogue of Leopold Mozart&#x27;s symphonies. It was written for 2 oboes, 2 horns in B, and a string section.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; {
 \key bes \major
 \tempo &quot;Allegro&quot;
 \partial 4 f8.\f f16 bes4 d,8. d16 f4 f,8. f16 bes4 d8. f16 \times 2/3 {f,8-. f (g} \times 2/3 {as g f)} g4
&lt;/score&gt;

The symphony is in four movements in the usual quick–slow–minuet–quick pattern:

#Allegro
#(Andante)
#Menuetto I &amp; II
#Presto
The publication of this symphony in the &quot;Alte Mozart-Ausgabe&quot;, the first collected edition of Mozart&#x27;s music, shows several points at which smaller, editorially-supplied notes are given, suggesting an unfinished composition. For instance, in &quot;Menuetto I&quot;, only the first violin and cello/double bass parts are completed; the second violin and viola parts in their entirety in this movement are editorial additions.

Since K. 17 is now believed not to be by W. A. Mozart, the &quot;Neue Mozart-Ausgabe&quot; does not include this symphony as part of its edition.

<text>Football is the most popular sport in Brazil and a prominent part of the country&#x27;s national identity. The Brazil national football team has won the FIFA World Cup five times, the most of any team, in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002. Brazil and Germany are the only teams to succeed in qualifying for all the World Cups for which they entered the qualifiers; Brazil is the only team to participate in every World Cup competition ever held. Brazil has also won an Olympic gold medal, at the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro and at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Pelé won three World Cups (he was injured during most of the 1962 World Cup). Some of the most prominent players in football come from Brazil, including Garrincha, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Romário, Ronaldinho, Nilton Santos, Djalma Santos, Taffarel, Falcão, Rivaldo, Zico, Kaká and Neymar in men&#x27;s game and Marta in the women&#x27;s game.

The governing body of football in Brazil is the Brazilian Football Confederation.

==History==

Football was introduced to Brazil by Scottish immigrant Thomas Donohoe. The first football match played in Brazil was in April 1894, played on a pitch marked out by Donohoe next to his workplace in Bangu.

In the 1870s, like many other British workers, a Scottish expatriate named John Miller worked on the railroad construction project in São Paulo with other European immigrants. In 1884, Miller sent his ten-year-old son Charles William Miller to Bannister School in Southampton, England, to be educated. Charles was a skilled athlete who quickly picked up the game of football at the time when the Football League was still being formed, and as an accomplished winger and striker Charles held school honors that gained him entry into the Southampton F.C. team, and later into the county team of Hampshire.

In 1888, the first sports club was founded in the city, São Paulo Athletic Club. In 1892, while still in England, Charles was invited to play a game for Corinthian F.C., a team formed of players invited from public schools and universities. On his return to Brazil, Charles brought some football equipment and a rule book with him. He then taught the rules of the game to players in São Paulo. On December 14, 1901, the &quot;Liga Paulista de Foot-Ball&quot; was founded, organising its own championship, &quot;Campeonato Paulista&quot;, first held in 1902. Therefore, Campeonato Paulista became the oldest official competition in Brazilian football. Another important club, called Società Sportiva Palestra Itália club, that was founded in 1914 played a big role in helping Italian immigrants get accustomed to Brazilian society. The club&#x27;s goal was to promote &quot;Italian identity and allegiance, helping the immigrant community to cultivate a sense of discrete ethnicity&quot;. 

São Paulo Athletic Club won the first three years&#x27; Paulista championships. Miller&#x27;s skills were far above his colleagues at this stage. He was given the honor of contributing his name to a move involving a deft flick of the ball with the heel &quot;Chaleira&quot; (the &quot;tea-pot&quot;). The first match played by one of Miller&#x27;s teams was six months after Donohoe&#x27;s.

Another competition, Campeonato Carioca, was first held in 1906 as the Rio de Janeiro State football championship, being contested up to present days.

Charles Miller kept a strong bond with English football throughout his life. After a tour of English team Corinthian F.C. to Brazil in 1910, Corinthians was established on September 1, taking on the name of the British side after a suggestion from Miller. In 1913 there were two different editions of the Campeonato Paulista. One was organized by the Associação Paulista de Esportes Atléticos (APEA) while the other one was organized by the Liga Paulista de Foot-Ball (LPF).

The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) was founded in 1914, but the current format for the Campeonato Brasileiro was only established in 1959.

==Football style==
Brazil plays a very unfundamental and distinctive style. For example, dribbling is an essential part of their style. 

After the third title in the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Brazilian football experienced a drought of World Cup titles, which would only end in 1994. In the meantime, despite playing flashy football that enchanted the world (like the 1982 FIFA World Cup squad), the Seleção started to prioritize results-based football. Thus, since the mid-1990s, Brazilian football began to lose its characteristics. For Tostão, Brazilian football has become outdated: &quot;The most classic example of this is that in the last 20 years Brazil has not had a single great midfield player. And this happened because there was a division in the midfield between the midfielders, who play scoring further back, and two midfielders, who play up front, close to the opponent&#x27;s area. The game lost exchange of passes in that environment. The Spanish and Germans do this very well. That was the best Brazil had in my time and disappeared. We had Gérson, Rivellino, Clodoaldo, then Falcão, Toninho Cerezo. This is what Iniesta, Rakitic, Modric and Kroos did, for example, and what Xavi and Schweinsteiger did. This characteristic that the Europeans encouraged most, the Brazilians devalued. We created many area dribblers. This is just one example of how Brazilian football has gone down the wrong path.&quot;

The great exodus of players in recent years to European competitions has generated a great debate in the country, especially about the consequences this would have on the style of Brazilian football, as it could &quot;Europeanize&quot; the way players act.

==Brazilian team==
The Brazil national football team is one of the main national football teams in the world. The biggest winner of the FIFA World Cup, with five titles, Brazil is known for its yellow and green shirt, with blue shorts and white socks, the four colors of the national flag. Because the shirt is predominantly yellow, the Brazilian team is also treated as the Canarinho team.

Founded on July 21, 1914, the 12th anniversary of Fluminense Football Club, the Seleção played its first game at the Laranjeiras Stadium, against the English team Exeter City. The Brazilian team is widely considered the most relevant team in world football.

The Brazilian national team also won the Copa América on eight occasions, the Confederations Cup on four, and in 2016 and 2020 won the gold medal, awarded to football champions at the Olympic Games, in the edition of the games held in Rio de Janeiro , having won three silver medals for runners-up and two bronze medals for third places.

The Brazilian team&#x27;s biggest rivals are Argentina and Uruguay on the American continent. In addition to these, the Europeans, England, Italy and the Netherlands, are traditional opponents, due to the clashes held, mainly in World Cups.

== Entities ==
===CBF===

The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) is the highest sports entity in the country. It organizes all championships in the national territory and represents Brazil in international competitions between countries with the Brazilian team. It is headquartered in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

===State federations===

State Federations are responsible for regulating football in each State within its jurisdiction. They are inferior bodies linked to the CBF, having their own autonomy to organize championships, elect president, sign contracts and recognize clubs and associations linked to the sport.

===Sports justice===

The Superior Court of Sports Justice (STJD, in Portuguese) is a legal body in the field of sports in Brazil. He is responsible for judging cases involving clubs and athletes. It is common for them to participate in the daily life of Brazilian football through trials of cases of suspension due to red and yellow cards, cases of aggression or even doping. Its lower body is the Sports Justice Court (TJD, in Portuguese), which operates at state level.

==Main clubs==

In Brazil, historically 12 clubs are considered &quot;big&quot;, although some others are also occasionally identified as big clubs, notably in their states of origin, including Atlético Paranaense. Those named in the lists with 12 clubs are: São Paulo, Palmeiras, Corinthians and Santos, all from the State of São Paulo; Fluminense, Flamengo, Vasco and Botafogo, all from the state of Rio de Janeiro; Internacional and Grêmio, from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and Atlético Mineiro and Cruzeiro, from the state of Minas Gerais. In addition to these thirteen mentioned, Brazilian champion clubs are Bahia, Coritiba, Guarani and Sport, a total of 17 Brazilian Championship champion clubs, with Atlético Paranaense having had enormous growth in assets and income in the 21st Century, therefore being considered one of the greats of Brazilian football by much of the national press.

==Calendar and competitions==

A source of great controversy in Brazil, the football calendar has over time been the target of criticism from fans, specialized journalists and even club directors. With the approval of the &quot;Football Fan Statute&quot; by the National Congress, changes began to transform the national calendar. According to the CBF, the intention is to make the Brazilian calendar compatible with those of European countries, to reconcile the interests of national and international football organizations.

The Brazilian season traditionally starts in January. Today, the first competition to be played by professional squads is the state championships. Previously, between the mid-1990s and 2002, regional competitions, such as the Rio-São Paulo Tournament, the Copa Sul-Minas and the Copa Nordeste, for example, were held at the beginning of the year. They involved teams from different states. However, they were extinguished, as they overwhelmed the big teams in the first half. The Copa do Brasil, played in the first half of the year, grew and gained importance. This is the only national competition that involves clubs from all states in Brazil, classified based on state tournaments from the previous year. By decision of the CBF, the Copa do Brasil now also includes the participation of teams qualified for the Libertadores da América, also played in the first half of each year.
Bahia team was the first Brazilian champion, in 1959.

The Brazilian Football Championship, also popularly known as Brasileirão, has been held between May and December normally, since 2003. As it starts before the middle of each year, the championship suffers with the opening of the foreign market between July and August, causing many players move to other countries. Furthermore, its beginning takes place during the decisive phase of the Copa Libertadores and its completion is in competition with the Copa Sudamericana.

In total, a Brazilian club can end up playing around 70 matches throughout the year. There are 20 more compared to the representatives of the main European leagues, or 22 compared to their South American neighbors. First division games in the country usually take place in rounds on Wednesday and Thursday, in the evening, and Saturday and Sunday, in the afternoon.

In the past, the state and national championships, since they were created, divided the Brazilian football calendar. One competition for each semester. Furthermore, in parallel to the state competitions, there were municipal and regional competitions and, in some places, the Home Tournament, which had all its matches in just one day.

==Football culture==
Football is a significant part of the Brazilian identity. It is considered the country&#x27;s most significant socio-cultural activity. In this way, football is not only a sport, but also an essential part of Brazil&#x27;s cultural identity. It is the most popular sport in Brazil, and Brazilians passion for the sport makes them often refer to their country as &quot;o País do Futebol&quot; (&quot;the country of football&quot;).

The integration of the sport in different segments of society marked the beginning of the Brazilian football identity. The sport became part of Brazilians daily life, and with time, it also became part of the popular culture.

The biggest evidence of the importance that football has on Brazilian culture is the World Cup. Every four years, Brazilians dominate the streets, cheering and celebrating their country. The sport brings people together.

However, in recent years, with the rise of the internet, which makes it easier to follow any sport, and with Brazil&#x27;s evolution in Olympic sports (the country became one of the 15 strongest in the world at the Olympic Games), the Brazilian population has been changing their tastes, and begins to become more interested in sports such as surfing, skateboarding, tennis, swimming, judo, volleyball and others, reducing the importance of football.

== Women&#x27;s football ==
Women&#x27;s football, unlike men&#x27;s, has noticeably less popularity in the country.

The Brazilian women&#x27;s national team managed to finish as runners-up at the Olympics in 2004, 2008 and 2024, and at the Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2007.

==League system==
Brazilian football clubs are affiliate to their state federations and state federations are themselves federate to Brazilian Football Confederation.
As such, each state has its own league pyramid (see State Championships), Campeonato Paulista (the oldest and most traditional), Campeonato Carioca, Campeonato Mineiro, Campeonato Gaúcho being the most prominent.

There&#x27;s a parallel federal pyramid. That means each club plays its state championships and only some biggest clubs play on the federal championships. Those two systems run in parallel there&#x27;s no direct rank or relegation-promotion from one to the other besides state federations being responsible for appointing one to four clubs each to form each year Campeonato Brasileiro Série D. Each state set its own rule for those appointments but it&#x27;s usually done through best position of the clubs on the top state tier that does not play any federal league or by a qualifying tournament, e.g. Copa Paulista is a tournament to select the fourth qualified from São Paulo (state) to Série D.

The federal system is composed of four tiers:
* Campeonato Brasileiro Série A - 20 clubs (relegates 4 to Série B)
* Campeonato Brasileiro Série B - 20 clubs (relegates 4 to Série C, promotes 4 to Série A)
* Campeonato Brasileiro Série C - 20 clubs (relegates 4 to Série D, promotes 4 to Série B)
* Campeonato Brasileiro Série D - 64 clubs (promotes 4 to Série C, other 60 demised). Despite the 4 relegated from last year Série C, all other 60 spots are designated by state federations by their own criteria.
State top tiers run from January to April and federal leagues from May to December, so clubs on federal leagues can handle their state schedule without conflict. Lower state tiers run from February to November.

Although uncommon it&#x27;s possible for a &#x27;big&#x27; club to be relegated to its state second-tier league while still playing a federal league. It happened for instance to Criciúma who was relegated to 2022 Campeonato Catarinense Série B, the second-tier league on Santa Catarina pyramid, while still playing Campeonato Brasileiro Série B. They resolved the problem of schedule conflict fielding a junior team in 2022 Campeonasto Catarinense Série B. Many of the states championships have their own promotion/relegation system.

<text>Baron Fauconberg (also Falconberg or Falconbridge) is an hereditary title created twice in the Peerage of England.

First created in 1295 when Sir Walter de Fauconberg, an Anglo-Norman, was summoned to parliament. Between 1463 and 1903 the peerage title fell abeyant until its abeyance was terminated in favour of Marcia Lane-Fox, &quot;Baroness Fauconberg and Conyers&quot;, who succeeded her father, Sackville Lane-Fox.

After the abeyance of 1463 the right to the barony of Fauconberg which resulted in the termination of 1903 was held jointly with the barony of Conyers; and, since then the two baronies have followed the same line of succession, including further abeyancies between 1948 and 2012 and from 2013.

The Countess of Yarborough predeceased her husband in 1926 when her family titles were inherited by her eldest surviving son, Lord Conyers (&quot;later&quot; 5th Earl of Yarborough). On his death in 1948 these ancient baronies again fell abeyant, between his two daughters as co-heirs, whilst the earldom was inherited by his brother.

Following the death of the younger of Lord Yarborough&#x27;s daughters in 2012, the titles were called out of abeyance in favour of his surviving daughter, Lady Diana Miller (&quot;later&quot; Countess of Mértola), 9th holder of the barony of Fauconberg and 16th of Conyers. Since Diana, Countess of Mértola&#x27;s death in 2013, both titles have fallen back into abeyance.

A descendant of the 1st Baron Fauconberg (&quot;by Writ&quot;), Sir Thomas Belasyse, 2nd Baronet, was elevated to the peerage as &quot;Baron Fauconberg, of Yarm in the County of York&quot;, in 1627; his grandson was advanced as Earl Fauconberg in 1689. For more information on this creation, see Viscount Fauconberg.

<text>Jesse Leonard Greenstein (October 15, 1909 – October 21, 2002) was an American astronomer. His parents were Maurice G. and Leah Feingold.

He earned a Ph.D, with thesis advisor Donald H. Menzel, from Harvard University in 1937, having started there at age 16. Before leaving Harvard, Greenstein was involved in a project with Fred Lawrence Whipple to explain Karl Jansky&#x27;s discovery of radio waves from the Milky Way and to propose a source. He began his professional career at Yerkes Observatory under Otto Struve and later went to Caltech. With Louis G. Henyey he invented a new spectrograph and a wide-field camera. He directed the Caltech astronomy program until 1972 and later did classified work on military reconnaissance satellites.

With Leverett Davis, Jr, he demonstrated in 1949 that the magnetic field in our galaxy is aligned with the spiral arms. His theoretical work with Davis was based on the conclusion just reached by William A. Hiltner that the recently detected polarization of starlight was due to dichroic extinction by interstellar dust grains aligned with the ambient magnetic field.

For the 1965 book &quot;Galactic Structure&quot;, edited by Blaauw and Schmidt, Greenstein wrote an important chapter on subluminous blue stars.

Greenstein did important work in determining the abundances of the elements in stars, and was, with Maarten Schmidt, among the first to recognize quasars as compact, very distant sources as bright as a galaxy. The spectra of the first quasars discovered, radio sources 3C 48 and 3C 273, were displaced so far to the red due to their redshifts as to be almost unrecognizable, but Greenstein deciphered 3C 48 shortly before Schmidt, his colleague at the Hale Observatories worked out the spectrum of 3C 273.

<doc id="633561" wikidata="Q903336" url="?curid=633561" title="69th Academy Awards">
<text>The 69th Academy Awards ceremony, organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) took place on March 24, 1997, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles beginning at 6:00 p.m. PST / 9:00 p.m. EST. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented the Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 1996. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates, and directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the fifth time. He first presided over the 62nd ceremony held in 1990 and had last hosted the 65th ceremony held in 1993. Three weeks earlier, in a ceremony held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on March 1, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Helen Hunt.

&quot;The English Patient&quot; won nine awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included &quot;Fargo&quot; with two awards and &quot;Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;Kolya&quot;, &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, &quot;Quest&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Sling Blade&quot;, and &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; with one.

== Winners and nominees ==
The nominees for the 69th Academy Awards were announced on February 11, 1997, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Arthur Hiller, president of the Academy, and actress Mira Sorvino. &quot;The English Patient&quot; received the most nominations with twelve; &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Shine&quot; came in second with seven apiece.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 24, 1997. Saul Zaentz became the third person to produce three Best Picture winners, having previously produced &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;Amadeus&quot;. He also became the seventh individual to receive an Oscar and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in the same year.

== Ceremony information ==
After taking a year off, Gil Cates was selected by AMPAS in November 1996 to oversee production of the ceremony for the seventh time. Immediately, he chose actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the 1997 telecast, stating, &quot;Billy is quick and agile and bright, and he plays the unexpected events of the live telecast like a Stradivarius. He&#x27;s become the standard against which all other hosting performances are measured.&quot; Crystal expressed his excitement on hosting the ceremony for the fifth time joking, &quot;Once Barry Scheck turned it down, I had a feeling they&#x27;d come to me.&quot; Furthermore, he set up a website with the address www.whyistheshowsolong.com asking the public to send in jokes that would eventually be used during the gala.

As with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened the show with the theme &quot;Togetherness of Moviegoing&quot; commenting, &quot;The thing that&#x27;s kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do that, when you think about it, are religion and sports.&quot; He concluded by noting that the movie theater is &quot;a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry.&quot; In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;Matinee&quot; (1993), and &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951) depicting audiences inside a movie theater.

Several other people and elements were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Documentary filmmaker Arnold Schwartzman designed the official ceremony poster featuring the titles of the previous 68 Best Picture winners superimposed in the shape of an Oscar statuette. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony. Choreographer Otis Sallid supervised the &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; musical number. Michael Flatley and the cast of the musical &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; performed a dance number during a montage saluting the art of Film Editors. Pianist David Helfgott, whom Best Actor winner Geoffrey Rush portrayed in the film &quot;Shine&quot;, played a rendition of &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov during the telecast.

Natalie Cole was initially scheduled to sing the nominated song &quot;I Finally Found Someone&quot; from &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; on the show after its songwriter and original performer Barbra Streisand declined to do so. However, after Cole contracted the flu, she withdrew for her performance duties and was eventually replaced by Celine Dion who also sang &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; later in the broadcast.

=== Box office performance of nominees ===
At the time of the nominations announcement on February 11, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $209 million, with an average of $41.9 million per film. &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $121.5 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;The English Patient&quot; ($42.3 million), &quot;Shine&quot; ($16.1 million), &quot;Fargo&quot; ($24 million) and finally &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; ($5.9 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 37 nominations went to 17 films on the list. Only &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (9th), &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (27th) and &quot;The English Patient&quot; (35th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1st), &quot;Twister&quot; (2nd), &quot;The Rock&quot; (4th), &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (7th), &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (8th), &quot;Eraser&quot; (13th), &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (14th), &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (15th), &quot;Sleepers&quot; (29th), &quot;Dragonheart&quot; (30th), &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; (32nd), &quot;Evita&quot; (36th), &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (39th), and &quot;Daylight&quot; (48th).

=== Critical response ===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Television critic Joanne Ostrow of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; commented &quot;Billy Crystal had a smashing first 10 minutes at the Oscars last night,&quot; but she later went on to say that inevitable sweep by &quot;The English Patient&quot; created a dull atmosphere that even sucked the energy out of Crystal&#x27;s performance. Columnist Brian Lowry wrote in &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;This year the mystery far outweighed the magic, in a telecast that proved less compelling--indeed, during stretches more downright dull--than recent predecessors.&quot; He also quipped that even though Crystal was mildly entertaining, some of his jokes &quot;felt a bit forced and stale.&quot; &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;″s Alan Sepinwall noted, &quot;Crystal was a bundle of energy, but his jokes had less zing than in the past.&quot; He also observed that the Film Editing dance number and &quot;That Thing You Do&quot; musical performance were hideously bloated.

Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Film critic Carrie Rickey of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote, &quot;Crystal sparkled as the host of the annual awards at the Shrine Auditorium.&quot; She also noted, &quot;The mood of the evening was elegant and gracious.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Steve Johnson commented, &quot;Billy Crystal returned as host of the Academy Awards on Monday night and proved that even if mainline Hollywood is nearly shut out in the trophy dispensing, one of its representatives can at least make a television broadcast entertaining.&quot; Television critic Kinney Littlefield of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; quipped, &quot;In his fifth stint as host, Crystal served up the sense of inclusive, insider movie community that had been missing during his three-year absence.&quot; In addition, she observed, &quot;For most of the evening, Oscar seemed newly energized, upbeat and full of splashy fun.&quot;

=== Ratings and reception ===
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 40.08 million people over its length, which was a 9% decrease from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. An estimated 73.83 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 27.49% of households watching over a 46.31 share. In addition, it also drew a lower 18–49 demo rating with a 16.55 rating over a 34.32 share among viewers in that demographic. It was the least watched ceremony in a decade and the lowest rated telecast since the 58th awards gala held in 1986.

In July 1997, the ceremony presentation received seven nominations at the 49th Primetime Emmy Awards. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Variety or Music Series or Special (Edward J. Greene, Tom Vicari, Robert Douglass).

<text>Viscount Fauconberg, of Henknowle in the Bishopric of Durham, was a title in the Peerage of England held by the head of the Belasyse family. This family descended from Sir Henry Belasyse, High Sheriff of Yorkshire from 1603 to 1604, who was created a Baronet, of Newborough in the County of York, in the Baronetage of England in 1611. His son, Sir Thomas, the second Baronet, was created Baron Fauconberg, of Yarm in the County of York, in the Peerage of England in 1627. In 1643 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Fauconberg, of Henknowle in the Bishopric of Durham, also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his grandson, Thomas, the second Viscount, the son of Henry Belasyse. Thomas was created Earl Fauconberg in the Peerage of England in 1689. He was childless and the earldom became extinct on his death in 1700. He was succeeded in the remaining titles by his nephew and namesake, Thomas, the third Viscount, the son of Sir Rowland Belasyse. The third Viscount was succeeded by his son, Thomas, the fourth Viscount, who in 1756 was created Earl Fauconberg, of Newborough in the County of York, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The Earl&#x27;s son Thomas, the second Earl, had no sons and the earldom became extinct on his death in 1802. He was succeeded in the remaining titles by his second cousin Rowland Belasyse, the sixth Viscount, the grandson and namesake of Rowland Belasyse, younger brother of the third Viscount. The sixth Viscount was succeeded by his younger brother, Charles the seventh Viscount, on whose death in 1815 all the titles became extinct.

John Belasyse, second son of the first Viscount, was created Baron Belasyse in 1645. For more information on this branch of the family, see the latter title.

<text>A bookend is an object tall, sturdy, and heavy enough that is placed at either end of a row of upright books to support or buttress them. Heavy bookends—made of wood, bronze, marble, and even large geodes—have been used in libraries, stores, and homes for centuries; the simple sheetmetal bookend (originally patented in 1877 by William Stebbins Barnard) uses the weight of the books standing on its foot to clamp the bookend&#x27;s tall brace against the last book&#x27;s back; in libraries, simple metal brackets are often used to support the end of a row of books. Elaborate and decorative bookends are common as elements in home decor.

The word &quot;bookend&quot; is also used metaphorically to refer to any pair of items which frame and define a significant or noteworthy event or place. For example, regarding the practice in the United States whereby Memorial Day and Labor Day demarcate the traditional beginning and end of summer, those two holidays could be referred to as bookends. Bookends are usually made of metal and plastic.

<doc id="633570" wikidata="Q3086828" url="?curid=633570" title="Fred F. Fielding">
<text>Fred Fisher Fielding (born March 21, 1939) is an American lawyer. He held the office of White House Counsel for US Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush in addition to serving as an associate and deputy White House counsel for Richard Nixon under John Dean. Fielding was also counsel to the first presidential transition of Donald Trump and a member of the 9/11 Commission. An alumnus of Gettysburg College, he is the namesake of that school&#x27;s Fielding Center for Presidential Leadership Study.

==Personal life==
Fielding was born in Philadelphia and raised in Mechanicsville, Pennsylvania. He attended Central Bucks High School West, graduated cum laude from Gettysburg College in 1961, and received his J.D. degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1964. He married Maria Dugger and had two children, Adam and Alexandra. At Gettysburg College, he is the namesake of the Fielding Center for Presidential Leadership Study.

==Career==
===Law firms===
Fielding began his career as a summer associate at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius in 1963.

Fielding was a senior partner at Wiley Rein LLP (formerly Wiley Rein &amp; Fielding), a Washington, D.C. law firm, and in 2009, Fielding joined Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP as a partner in the firm&#x27;s Washington office. In 2007, he represented, along with others, Blackwater Worldwide, a private military company. Following the Blackwater Baghdad shootings, Henry Waxman&#x27;s House Oversight Committee subpoenaed its chief executive officer Erik Prince to testify. The climate of opinion among politicians and the public at large jeopardized its contracts to provide security for State Department personnel in Iraq.

===Presidential administrations===
====Richard Nixon====
Fielding served as Associate Counsel for President Richard Nixon from 1970 to 1972, where he was the deputy to John Dean during the Watergate scandal. He then returned to Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.

=====Deep Throat speculation=====
In April 2003, a team of journalism students taught by William Gaines conducted a detailed review of source materials, leading them to conclude that Fielding was Deep Throat, the unnamed source for articles written by &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Many years previously, former White House Chief of Staff for Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, also speculated that Fielding was Deep Throat. That speculation ended after former Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  Mark Felt announced in May 2005 that he was Deep Throat, as later confirmed by Woodward, Bernstein and Executive Editor Ben Bradlee in a statement released through &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

====Ronald Reagan====
He was the Counsel to the President for President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1986.

====George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton====
Fielding served on the Tribunal on the U.S.-UK Air Treaty Dispute (1989–1994), George H. W. Bush&#x27;s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform (1989), and Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater&#x27;s Task Force on Aviation Disasters (1997–1998).

====9/11 Commission====
In 2002, Fielding, became one of ten bipartisan members of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 Commission), where he was credited with helping to persuade the Bush administration to be more transparent with the commission than the administration had initially planned to be.

====George W. Bush====
Fielding returned to government on January 8, 2007 by President George W. Bush to replace outgoing White House Counsel Harriet Miers. Fielding was responsible for approving the pardon issued by President Bush to convicted real estate fraudster Isaac Toussie. When the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that Toussie had made large contributions to the Republican Party, the White House revoked the pardon the next day. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine in July 2009, Fielding opposed Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s request that President Bush issue a full pardon to convicted vice presidential aide Scooter Libby. Following Fielding&#x27;s advice, Bush ended up not pardoning Libby.

====Donald Trump====
Fielding served on president-elect Donald Trump&#x27;s legal team. Fielding&#x27;s work for Trump was announced by his Morgan, Lewis colleague, Sheri Dillon, when she spoke at Trump&#x27;s January 11, 2017, a day after a leaked document alleged the Trump campaign&#x27;s long suspected collusion with Russian efforts to derail his presidential campaign competitor Hillary Clinton.

=====Russia=====
Fielding has published legal articles on the topics of presidential counsel and Russia and Ukraine matters in his role at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP. The firm was named 2016 Russia Law Firm of the Year by Chambers and Partners The awards are based on research and, &quot;substantial feedback from clients&quot;. The firm&#x27;s Moscow office has won previous honors for its high-profile work in Russia. Including a Tier 1 rank from The Legal 500 EMEA for Corporate/M&amp;A Law Firm, Russia and a rank in Bank 1 from Chambers Global for Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law Firm, Russia.

<doc id="633572" wikidata="Q1191344" url="?curid=633572" title="Northern Illinois University">
<text>Northern Illinois University (NIU) is a public research university in DeKalb, Illinois, United States. It was founded as Northern Illinois State Normal School in 1895 by Illinois Governor John P. Altgeld, initially to provide the state with college-educated teachers. In addition to the main campus in DeKalb, it has satellite centers in Chicago, Naperville, Rockford, and Oregon, Illinois.

The university is composed of seven degree-granting colleges and has a student body of approximately 16,000. NIU is one of seven public universities in Illinois that compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s, Division I. The athletic teams are known as the Huskies and compete in the Mid-American Conference (MAC).

==History==
Northern Illinois University was founded as part of the expansion of the normal school program established in 1857 in Normal, Illinois. In 1895, the state legislature created a board of trustees for the governance of the Northern Illinois State Normal School, which would grow into what is today known as NIU.

In July 1917, the Illinois Senate consolidated the boards of trustees for the five state normal schools (Eastern Illinois State Normal School, Illinois State Normal School, Northern Illinois State Normal School, Southern Illinois State Normal University, and Western Illinois State Normal School) into one state Normal School Board.

Over the next fifty-eight years, the school and the governing board changed their names several times. In 1921, the legislature gave the institution the name Northern Illinois State Teachers College and empowered it to award the four-year Bachelor of Education degree. In 1941, the Normal School Board changed its name to the Teachers College Board. In 1951 the Teachers College Board authorized the college to grant the degree Master of Science in education, and the institution&#x27;s Graduate School was established. On July 1, 1955, the state legislature renamed the college Northern Illinois State College and authorized the college to broaden its educational services by offering academic work in areas other than teacher education. The Teachers College Board granted permission for the college to add curricula leading to the degrees Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science. On July 1, 1957, the Seventieth General Assembly renamed Northern Illinois State College as Northern Illinois University in recognition of its expanded status as a liberal arts university.

In 1965, the Illinois State Teachers College Board became the Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities and was reorganized to include Northeastern University, Governor&#x27;s State, and Chicago State Universities. In 1967 authority for Northern Illinois University, Illinois State University, and Sangamon State University were passed on to a newly formed board of regents. In 1984, the board created the position of chancellor for the three regent universities to act as a chief executive for all three schools. In 1996, authority for each of the three regency universities was transferred to three independent boards of trustees, each concerned with only one university.

===2008 mass shooting===

In 2008, the university drew international attention when a gunman opened fire in a crowd of students on campus, killing five students and injuring 17 more people before fatally shooting himself. 

The shooting happened at the campus&#x27;s Cole Hall at approximately 3:05 p.m. Central Standard Time. The school placed the campus on lockdown; students and teachers were advised to head to a secure location, take cover, and avoid the scene and all buildings in the vicinity of the area.

After the shooting, the university administration cancelled classes for the rest of the week as well as the following week.

<doc id="633574" wikidata="Q1063573" url="?curid=633574" title="Foreign Policy">
<text>Foreign Policy is an American news publication founded in 1970 focused on global affairs, current events, and domestic and international policy. It produces content daily on its website and app, and in four print issues annually.

&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine and ForeignPolicy.com are published by The FP Group, a division of Graham Holdings Company (formerly The Washington Post Company). The FP Group also produces FP Events, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;″s events division, launched in 2012.

== History ==
&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; was founded in late 1970 by Samuel P. Huntington, professor of Harvard University, and his friend Warren Demian Manshel to give a voice to alternative views about American foreign policy at the time of the Vietnam War. Huntington hoped it would be &quot;serious but not scholarly, lively but not glib&quot;.

In early 1978, after six years of close partnership, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace acquired full ownership of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;. In 2000, a format change was implemented from a slim quarterly academic journal to a bimonthly magazine. It also launched international editions in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.

In September 2008, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; was bought by The Washington Post Company (now Graham Holdings Company). In 2012, Foreign Policy grew to become the FP Group—an expansion of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine to include ForeignPolicy.com and FP Events.

== Style ==
According to its submission guidelines, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; articles &quot;strike the balance&quot; between informed specialist research and general readability, and tend to be written in plain rather than language.

== Editorial stance ==
&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election. This was the first time in its 50-year history the magazine endorsed a candidate.

== Awards ==
Since 2003, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; has been nominated for eight National Magazine Awards, winning six: three for its print publication and three for its digital publication at ForeignPolicy.com. &quot;FP&quot; is the only independent magazine that has won consecutive digital national magazine awards every year from being established in 2009.

<doc id="633575" wikidata="Q7029585" url="?curid=633575" title="Nicolas Collins">
<text>Nicolas Collins (born March 26, 1954, in New York City) is a composer of mostly electronic music, a sound artist and writer. He received his BA and MA from Wesleyan University, and his PhD from the University of East Anglia. Upon graduating from Wesleyan, he was a Watson Fellow.

==Biography==
In the 1980s Collins was &quot;a pioneer in the use of microcomputers in live performance, and has made extensive use of &#x27;home-made&#x27; electronic circuitry, radio, found sound material, and transformed musical instruments.&quot; Trained in the experimental compositional tradition of Alvin Lucier, David Behrman, and David Tudor, all of whom he worked with closely, Collins also immersed himself in the New York Improvised Music scene of the 1980s. Using home-built instruments that combined circuitry, simple computers and traditional instruments such as trombones and slide guitars, he collaborated and performed with Tom Cora, Shelley Hirsch, Christian Marclay, Zeena Parkins, John Zorn and others. Collins&#x27;s compositions frequently ask performers to respond to unpredictable musical cues, as in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Music&quot; (1985), in which the performer DJs with snippets of live scanning radio, or &quot;Still Lives&quot; (1993), in which a solo trumpet player improvises against a skipping CD of Renaissance brass music. More recent works include &quot;In Memoriam Michel Waiswicz&quot; (2008), in which a birthday candle &#x27;plays&#x27; a light-sensitive circuit until it burns down; and &quot;Speak, Memory&quot; (2016) in which the digital data of photographic images is played as sound in a room, where it is allowed to decay, and the decay is reflected in the photograph, which changes and eventually disappears as sound fades to silence.

As a studio artist at PS1 in 1983-84, Collins exhibited sound sculptures of &#x27;backwards guitars&#x27;—found instruments modified so the pick-ups resonated the guitar strings with live radio signals. Subsequent installation projects at Musée Malraux (Le Havre), Gemeente Museum Hague (den Haag), ZKM (Karlsruhe); and the Sonambiente sound art festival (Berlin), featured performing devices such a model train that &#x27;plays&#x27;a long amplified wire, as well as multi-channel video works.

Collins&#x27; musical compositions have been presented at venues around the world, ranging from CBGB to the Concertgebouw. 
As a composer-performer he has presented concerts and workshops on every continent save Antarctica.
He has also been active as a curator, policy adviser, and board member for numerous cultural organizations, since first taking on the post of Curator of Music Performances and Sound Installations at PS1/The Clocktower (now MoMA PS1) in 1985. In 1992 he left New York to become Artistic Director of STEIM (Studio for Electro Instrumental Music) in Amsterdam, and later moved to Berlin on a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) composer-in-residence fellowship. From 1997 to 2017 Collins served as Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;Leonardo Music Journal&quot;, a peer-reviewed academic journal published by the MIT Press., and he sits on the editorial boards of &quot;Resonance: the Journal of Sound and Culture&quot; (University of California Press), &quot;Acoustic Arts &amp; Artifacts: Technology, Aesthetics, Communication&quot; (Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice), the &quot;Journal of Sound Studies&quot; (The Netherlands), and &quot;Resonancias – Revista de Investigación Musical&quot; (Chile).

Collins is Professor of Sound at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and has been guest professor at Institute of Sonology, Royal Conservatory of The Hague; Kunsthochschule Kassel, Germany; Universität der Künste Berlin; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago; and Technische Universität Berlin, among other locations.

In 2006 Collins&#x27; book &quot;Handmade Electronic Music: The Art of Hardware Hacking&quot; was published by Routledge, and a second edition was published in 2009. A broadly expanded third edition, released in the summer of 2020, documents the grass-roots spread of &#x27;Hardware Hacking&#x27; through local art and music organizations and collectives, often in conjunction with feminist and/or regional cultural concerns, from Brazil to Indonesia. He was a major influence on the establishment of the Musical Electronics Library in New Zealand.

Collins lives and works in Berlin, Chicago and rural Massachusetts.
