<text>Leonard Susskind (; born June 16, 1940) is an American theoretical physicist, Professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University and founding director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. His research interests are string theory, quantum field theory, quantum statistical mechanics and quantum cosmology. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an associate member of the faculty of Canada&#x27;s Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and a distinguished professor of the Korea Institute for Advanced Study.

Susskind is widely regarded as one of the fathers of string theory. He was the first to give a precise string-theoretic interpretation of the holographic principle in 1995 and the first to introduce the idea of the string theory landscape in 2003.

Susskind was awarded the 1998 J. J. Sakurai Prize, the 2018 Oskar Klein Medal, and the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 2023.

== Early life and education ==
Leonard Susskind was born to a Jewish family from the South Bronx in New York City. He began working as a plumber at the age of 16, taking over from his father who had become ill. Later, he enrolled in the City College of New York as an engineering student and had planned to study mechanical engineering but he changed his mind and later graduated with a B.S. in physics in 1962. In an interview in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Susskind recalls a discussion with his father that changed his career path: &quot;When I told my father I wanted to be a physicist, he said, &#x27;Hell no, you ain&#x27;t going to work in a drug store.&#x27; I said, &#x27;No, not a pharmacist.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Like Einstein.&#x27; He poked me in the chest with a piece of plumbing pipe. &#x27;You ain&#x27;t going to be no engineer,&#x27; he said. &#x27;You&#x27;re going to be Einstein.&#x27;&quot; Susskind then studied at Cornell University under Peter A. Carruthers, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1965.

== Career ==
Susskind was an assistant professor of physics, then an associate professor at Yeshiva University (1966–1970), after which he went for a year to the Tel Aviv University (1971–72), returning to Yeshiva to become a professor of physics (1970–1979). Since 1979 he has been professor of physics at Stanford University, and since 2000 has held the Felix Bloch professorship of physics.

Susskind was awarded the 1998 J. J. Sakurai Prize for his &quot;pioneering contributions to hadronic string models, lattice gauge theories, quantum chromodynamics, and dynamical symmetry breaking.&quot; Susskind&#x27;s hallmark, according to colleagues, has been the application of &quot;brilliant imagination and originality to the theoretical study of the nature of the elementary particles and forces that make up the physical world.&quot;

In 2007, Susskind joined the faculty of Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, as an associate member. He has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also a distinguished professor at Korea Institute for Advanced Study.

=== Scientific career ===
Susskind was one of at least three physicists, alongside Yoichiro Nambu and Holger Bech Nielsen, who independently discovered during or around 1970 that Gabriele Veneziano&#x27;s dual resonance model of strong interactions could be described by a quantum mechanical model of oscillating strings, and was the first to propose the idea of the string theory landscape. Susskind has also made important contributions in the following areas of physics:
* The independent discovery of the string theory model of particle physics
* The theory of quark confinement
* The development of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory known as Kogut–Susskind fermions
* The theory of scaling violations in deep inelastic electroproduction
* The theory of symmetry breaking sometimes known as &quot;technicolor theory&quot;
* The second, yet independent, theory of cosmological baryogenesis (Andrei Sakharov&#x27;s work was first, but was mostly unknown in the Western hemisphere)
* String theory of black hole entropy
* The principle of black hole complementarity
* The causal patch hypothesis
* The holographic principle
* M-theory, including development of the Banks–Fischler–Shenker–Susskind matrix string model
* Introduction of holographic entropy bounds in physical cosmology
* Cool horizons for entangled black holes
* The idea of an anthropic string theory landscape
* The census taker&#x27;s hat
* Most recently, application of ideas from information and computation theory, such as the complexity equals action conjecture, to the physics and thermodynamics of black holes, and holographic theories in general.

==Books==
Susskind is the author of several popular science books.

===&quot;The Cosmic Landscape&quot;===

&quot;The Cosmic Landscape: String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent Design&quot; is Susskind&#x27;s first popular science book, published by Little, Brown and Company on December 12, 2005. It is Susskind&#x27;s attempt to bring his idea of the anthropic landscape of string theory to the general public. In the book, Susskind describes how the string theory landscape was an almost inevitable consequence of several factors, one of which was Steven Weinberg&#x27;s prediction of the cosmological constant in 1987. The question addressed here is why our universe is fine-tuned for our existence. Susskind explains that Weinberg calculated that if the cosmological constant was just a little different, our universe would cease to exist.

===&quot;The Black Hole War&quot;===
&quot;The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics&quot; is Susskind&#x27;s second popular science book, published by Little, Brown, and Company on July 7, 2008. The book is his most famous work and explains what he thinks would happen to the information and matter stored in a black hole when it evaporates. The book sparked from a debate that started in 1981, when there was a meeting of physicists to try to decode some of the mysteries about how particles of particular elemental compounds function. During this discussion Stephen Hawking stated that the information inside a black hole is lost forever as the black hole evaporates. It took 28 years for Leonard Susskind to formulate his theory that would prove Hawking wrong. He then published his theory in his book, &quot;The Black Hole War&quot;. Like &quot;The Cosmic Landscape&quot;, &quot;The Black Hole War&quot; is aimed at the lay reader. He writes: &quot;The real tools for understanding the quantum universe are abstract mathematics: infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, projection operators, unitary matrices and a lot of other advanced principles that take a few years to learn. But let&#x27;s see how we do in just a few pages&quot;.

===&quot;The Theoretical Minimum&quot; book series===

Susskind co-authored a series of companion books to his lecture series &quot;The Theoretical Minimum&quot;. The first of these, &quot;The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics&quot;, was published in 2013 and presents the modern formulations of classical mechanics. The second of these, &quot;Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum&quot;, was published in February 2014. The third book, &quot;Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory: The Theoretical Minimum&quot; (September 26, 2017), introduces readers to Einstein&#x27;s special relativity and Maxwell&#x27;s classical field theory. The fourth book in the series, &quot;General Relativity: The Theoretical Minimum&quot; was published in January 2023.

==&quot;The Theoretical Minimum&quot; lecture series==
Susskind teaches a series of Stanford Continuing Studies courses about modern physics referred to as &quot;The Theoretical Minimum&quot;. The title of the series is a clear reference to Landau&#x27;s famous comprehensive exam called the &quot;Theoretical Minimum&quot; which students were expected to pass before admission to his school. &quot;The Theoretical Minimum&quot; lectures later formed the basis for the books of the same name. The goal of the courses is to teach the basic but rigorous theoretical foundations required to study certain areas of physics. The sequence covers classical mechanics, relativity, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and cosmology, including the physics of black holes.

These courses are available on &quot;The Theoretical Minimum&quot; website, on iTunes, and on YouTube. The courses are intended for the mathematically literate public as well as physical science/mathematics students. Susskind aims the courses at people with prior exposure to algebra, and calculus. Homework and study outside of class is otherwise unnecessary. Susskind explains most of the mathematics used, which form the basis of the lectures.

==Cornell Messenger Lectures==
Susskind gave 3 lectures &quot;The Birth of the Universe and the Origin of Laws of Physics&quot; April 28-May 1, 2014 in the Cornell Messenger Lecture series which are posted on a Cornell website.

==Smolin–Susskind debate==
The Smolin–Susskind debate refers to the series of intense postings in 2004 between Lee Smolin and Susskind, concerning Smolin&#x27;s argument that the &quot;&quot;anthropic principle&quot; cannot yield any falsifiable predictions, and therefore cannot be a part of science&quot;. It began on 26 July 2004, with Smolin&#x27;s publication of &quot;scientific alternatives to the anthropic principle&quot;. Smolin e-mailed Susskind asking for a comment. Having not had the chance to read the paper, Susskind requested a summarization of his arguments.

Smolin obliged, and on 28 July 2004, Susskind responded, saying that the logic Smolin followed &quot;can lead to ridiculous conclusions&quot;. The next day, Smolin responded, saying that &quot;If a large body of our colleagues feels comfortable believing a theory that cannot be proved wrong, then the progress of science could get stuck, leading to a situation in which false, but unfalsifiable theories dominate the attention of our field.&quot; This was followed by another paper by Susskind which made a few comments about Smolin&#x27;s theory of &quot;cosmic natural selection&quot;.

The Smolin–Susskind debate finally ended with each of them agreeing to write a final letter which would be posted on the edge.org website, with three conditions attached:
: (1) No more than one letter each.
: (2) Neither sees the other&#x27;s letter in advance.
: (3) No changes after the fact.

== Personal life ==
He has been married twice, first in 1960, and he has four children. Susskind is a great-grandfather.

* Chown, Marcus, &quot;Our world may be a giant hologram&quot;, &quot;New Scientist&quot;, 15 January 2009, issue 2691: &quot;The holograms you find on credit cards and banknotes are etched on two-dimensional plastic films. When light bounces off them, it recreates the appearance of a 3D image. In the 1990s physicists Leonard Susskind and Nobel prize winner Gerard &#x27;t Hooft suggested that the same principle might apply to the universe as a whole. Our everyday experience might itself be a holographic projection of physical processes that take place on a distant, 2D surface.&quot;

<text>The Little Conemaugh River is a tributary of the Conemaugh River, approximately long, in western Pennsylvania in the United States.

The main branch rises in eastern Cambria County, along the western slope of the Appalachian ridge separating the watersheds of the Ohio and Susquehanna rivers. It flows west-southwest through the mountains, past Cassandra, Portage, and Summerhill, where it is joined by the South Fork Little Conemaugh River. It then follows a west-northwest course to Johnstown, where it joins the Stonycreek River to form the Conemaugh River.

==Mine drainage==
The river flows through scenic mountainous areas but is considered severely degraded by abandoned mine drainage, most notably the Hughes bore hole, from the long exploitation of the region&#x27;s coal resources. The recovery of the river is an ongoing project of federal, state, and private agencies.

==History==
Only four navigable passes pierce the barrier range of the Appalachian Mountains in this part of the United States, one of which leads to the Conemaugh Valley. The headwaters of the Little Conemaugh form on the western side of Tunnelhill, Pennsylvania, at Cresson Pass in northern Cambria County, which is transited by the line of the Eastern Continental drainage divide. The river&#x27;s upper valley falls off gradually enough that the terrain forms a natural transportation corridor navigable by muscle-powered vehicles such as Indian travois and Conestoga wagons. Consequently, when the earliest settlers pushed west from the Susquehanna basin, the waters falling or rising on the eastern side of the drainage divide ran down through valleys Amerindians had used for centuries to cross between the west and east sides of the mountains.

In the early 19th century, when Pennsylvania made a bid to connect to new business opportunities in the rapidly growing Ohio Valley, the state government launched the great engineering project of the Pennsylvania Canal System, which connected eastern and western Pennsylvania via the Conemaugh Valley and Johnstown. Several major dams were constructed on the rivers of the Conemaugh drainage system in order to impound reservoirs which could be used as permanent canals and towpaths, including one on the South Fork Little Conemaugh in the mountains upstream of Johnstown. The river was paralleled by the western inclines of the Allegheny Portage Railroad, connecting the two branches of the Pennsylvania Main Line Canals with the western terminus of the portage railroad at Johnstown. Created as part of the Pennsylvania Main Line of Public Works, the railway operated from its completion in 1834 until it was sold in 1854 to the Pennsylvania Railroad, which took over its rights of way. Thereafter, the banks of the Conemaugh and Little Conemaugh hosted one of the most important rail transport corridors running east–west across the Appalachian Mountains. As the canal system was gradually made obsolete by faster and cheaper rail transport, the impoundments in the valley were drained or sold to private interests. The reservoir on the South Fork Little Conemaugh was repurposed as a recreational property for use by members of a private fishing and hunting club.

On May 31, 1889, the dam holding back this reservoir failed during a period of extremely heavy rainfall, sending a wall of water up to 60 ft (18 m) high down the Little Conemaugh at 40 mph (64 km/h), causing massive flooding in the towns along its banks, including Johnstown, and resulting in the loss of 2,209 lives in the worst civilian disaster of the 19th century in the United States. The event is remembered to history as the Johnstown Flood.

<doc id="644459" wikidata="Q8023910" url="?curid=644459" title="ExPlace Wind Turbine">
<text>The ExPlace Wind Turbine is a tall wind turbine located on the grounds of the Exhibition Place co-owned by the WindShare for-profit co-operative and Rankin Integrated Energy (part of Rankin Construction), a construction company specializing in renewable projects. It is the first wind turbine installed in a major North American urban city centre, and the first community-owned wind power project in Ontario. WindShare itself was officially launched in February 2002 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was created by the non-profit Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative (TREC) which was incorporated in 1998. TREC continues to exist as a separate non-profit entity.

== History ==
In 1998, the Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative (TREC) was incorporated. The next year in 1999, the TREC received a grant to study three potential sites for an urban wind turbine project in Toronto. On June 30, 1999, the TREC formed an ad hoc partnership with Toronto Hydro to build wind turbines in Toronto. In February 2002, the TREC officially launched the WindShare co-operative with the policy of asking members of the non-profit TREC to become members of the for-profit WindShare co-operative.

From December 16 to 18, 2002, the WindShare&#x27;s ExPlace wind turbine was erected. It is the first wind turbine installed in a major North American urban city centre, and the first community-owned wind power project in Ontario. On January 23, 2003, the ExPlace turbine began generating electricity. In 2006, the Government of Ontario introduced a feed-in tariff. In 2009, as a part of the Green Energy Act, the feed-in tariff was revised by the Government of Ontario.

In the summer of 2012, the turbine was brought offline due to problems with the converter, the part of the turbine that converts the movement of the blades of the turbine into electricity. The converter was replaced and the turbine was brought back online in March 2013. Again in July 2014, the new converter had issues, causing the turbine to go offline until October of the same year while the issues were resolved.

In March 2017, water damaged the wind turbine&#x27;s ring generator during a storm, causing the wind turbine to stop operating. Toronto Hydro took until August 2017 to fund a specialist firm to begin the required repairs as well as other upgrades to the turbine with work originally expected to be completed by November of the same year. In February 2019, the turbine finally became operational again.

On November 4, 2022, Toronto Hydro Energy Services Inc. transferred its 55.1 per cent share in the project to WindShare Cooperative. Upon completing the transfer, WindShare Cooperative created a joint partnership with Rankin Integrated Energy (part of Rankin Construction), a construction company specializing in renewable projects.

== Technical details ==
The turbine is tall and is a 750 kW direct drive Lagerwey Wind LW 52 wind turbine that weighs approximately . The tower of the turbine is tall and the diameter of the rotor is . The turbine has three blades that are each long. The rotor and reach a speed of approximately 24.5 rpm. The turbine is able to produce a power output in the range of 625 - 650 kilowatts at 12 m/s (871 electrical hp) in winds of to . Construction of the turbine cost approximately CAD$1.8 million (including foundation, interconnect, and erection).

The wind turbine adds an average of 1000 MWh of electricity to the city&#x27;s main power grid per year.

<doc id="644470" wikidata="Q3071335" url="?curid=644470" title="Sweden and the Winter War">
<text>The Winter War was fought in the four months following the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939. This took place three months after the German invasion of Poland that triggered the start of World War II in Europe. Sweden did not become actively involved in the conflict, but did indirectly support Finland. The Swedish Volunteer Corps provided 9,640 officers and men. The Swedish Voluntary Air Force also provided 25 aircraft that destroyed twelve Soviet aircraft while only losing six planes with only two to actual enemy action and four to accidents. Sweden also provided a portion of the weapons and equipment used by the Finns throughout the war.

==Background to Swedish policy==

According to the dominant view in Sweden&#x27;s foreign ministry, Finland&#x27;s foreign policy had, since its independence and 1918 civil war, been &quot;unsteady and adventurous&quot;. In addition, Finland&#x27;s domestic politics were viewed with great suspicion by Swedish Social Democrats. After the Socialists&#x27; defeat in the civil war, anti-parliamentarism and anti-socialist policies dominated Swedish impressions of Finland. Cooperation with Finland had in the 1920s and 1930s primarily been advocated by fringe right-wing politicians and military officers. Both to the right and to the left, a closer cooperation with Finland was seen as a means to counter the hegemonic position of the Social Democrats in Sweden.

After the Abyssinia Crisis, both Finland and Sweden were forced to adjust their foreign policies, as the League of Nations seemed to offer only a hollow protection against foreign aggression. In the Baltic region both the reborn Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were seen as likely aggressors, eager to regain territories lost as a result of World War I, and likely to want to expand their influence further, if possible. Finland re-oriented its foreign policy towards Scandinavia and a neutralist policy of the Swedish type. The detailed plans for military cooperation were supplemented by intensified contacts between diplomats and politicians. Social Democrats under Väinö Tanner were rehabilitated and included in the cabinet. Finland&#x27;s embassy in Stockholm was deemed the most important, and Juho Kusti Paasikivi became ambassador there.

Even though central politicians and officials had been converted and convinced of the necessity for a closer Swedish–Finnish cooperation, parliamentarians and prominent individuals did not change their anti-Swedish or anti-Finnish attitudes as easily. Impressions made (in both countries) in connection with Finland&#x27;s independence, civil war, the Åland crisis, language strife, and the Lapua Movement all stuck. These impressions, in turn, were compounded by a tendency in Sweden to emphasize the danger of Nazi expansionism and to view the Soviet Union with a great deal of goodwill: in Finland, however, the converse view was dominant.

The Nordic trend did not officially allow Swedish participation in security management of the Gulf of Finland with Finland. However, behind the scene, the general staff of Sweden and Finland had negotiated secretly the Gulf of Finland blockade plan in 1929. Sweden agreed that it would first suggest the Gulf blockade to the Estonians in 1930. Officially Sweden would not participate, but it would give materiel and auxiliary troops if the Soviet Union attacked.

Litvinov&#x27;s demise as Soviet Foreign Minister in March 1939 signaled an increasing tension and danger for Finland and the Baltic countries, and indirectly for Sweden. Litvinov was known as being friendly towards the West, whereas the new minister, Molotov, had made a more aggressive impression. Litvinov&#x27;s half-promises to accept and support joint Finnish–Swedish provisions for the defense of Åland against the potential German threat were not upheld by his successor. As a consequence, Soviet-leaning ministers in Sweden, such as Ernst Wigforss and Östen Undén, proposed Sweden&#x27;s withdrawal from these plans. Parliament agreed, being eager to continue Sweden&#x27;s successful policy, since 1812, of non-confrontation towards Russia.

== The political response to the Soviet invasion ==
In the face of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the following Soviet aggressions against Poland and the Baltic countries, Finland&#x27;s situation seemed increasingly dangerous. On 4 October Finland&#x27;s government asked if Sweden was prepared to contribute to Åland&#x27;s defense with military means. The following day, Molotov invited a Finnish delegation to Moscow, with Sweden&#x27;s parliament being informed the day after. On 12 October it turned out that the political support was deemed insufficient in Sweden for a military engagement on Åland: the Rightist Party was in favor, the Social Democrats were split, and a majority of the Farmers party (Bondeförbundet) and all the Liberals were opposed. The opposition to Swedish military assistance on Åland was strengthened by the fear that intervention would become extended to Mainland Finland, which few parliamentarians would support.

Publicly, Finland was supported, but Finland&#x27;s Foreign Minister Elias Erkko was informed that Swedish troops were not to be expected. It remains controversial to this day whether he delivered this message to his colleagues and his president.

The message perceived by public opinion in Finland, as well as in Sweden, thus differed greatly from the Swedish government&#x27;s intentions. For two months Finland literally fought for her national survival, but by the end of January 1940, the Soviet Union gave up its plans for a reconquest of the whole of Finland. It was now deemed sufficient if Finland ceded its industrial heartland, including its second largest city Viipuri (Viborg, currently Vyborg). This would mean that the Soviet Union might gain much greater territory than the Red Army had been able to seize control of by military means. Through the so-called &quot;Statsrådsdiktamen,&quot; Sweden&#x27;s king helped the public perception of Sweden&#x27;s intentions converge with the government&#x27;s intentions.

=== Message from the King ===

In the &quot;Statsrådsdiktamen&quot; on 19 February 1940, Sweden&#x27;s king Gustaf V publicly rejected pleas from Finland&#x27;s government for military intervention in the Winter War to help defend Finland against the Soviet invasion. This statement from the king was aimed at pressuring Finland to accept harsh Soviet peace conditions and to quiet a strong Swedish activist public opinion advocating participation in the war. The statement had this effect, but was also to produce substantial bitterness in Finland.

During the war, Sweden&#x27;s government rejected a total of three formal pleas from Finland&#x27;s government to engage militarily in Finland&#x27;s defense against the Soviet Union. Detailed plans for Swedish deployment along Finland&#x27;s border had been made ten years before, and they were regularly updated in secret contacts between the General Staffs of the two countries. However, no formal alliance had been concluded, and a proposed official recognition of cooperative defense of the de-militarized Åland had been rebuffed by Sweden&#x27;s parliament in June 1939.

== Swedish military&#x27;s position ==

One of the main considerations that led the Swedish government to declare Sweden a non-belligerent state was concern that they might otherwise lose control of the internal situation in Sweden. The Soviet demands on Finland in the months prior to the outbreak of war had roused public opinion. While there had been large demonstrations in support of Finland, Russia was a traditional enemy, and fear of the Russians had been a part of the Swedish mindset since 1719, when Russian galleys burned Swedish coastal communities during the Great Northern War. Therefore, there was a strong feeling that it was better to defend Sweden on Finnish soil.

Swedish military strength was at one of its low points due to the grand disarmament of 1925. The rearmament program decided in 1936 had not yet had any substantial effect on the armed forces. The army had only 16 tanks apart from a small number of tankettes armed with machine guns. Air defence guns were few and the air force had only 36 Gloster Gladiator fighters. Modern artillery was very limited, short range guns of the Great War era or older were the norm. Worse was that no modern military material was available for purchase, as the producing countries regarded exports secondary to equipping their own armed forces.

Even worse, training had been very reduced in a 1925 decision to cut back on the armed forces, and most units had no winter training and had to leave army units needing to conduct rehearsal training after a mobilization.

Within the Swedish military, officers who had been volunteers in the Finnish Civil War were now senior officers, most notably Axel Rappe, a member of the General Staff, and Archibald Douglas, commander of the Northern Army Corps.

The belief that Sweden was best served by a defence in Finland was enacted primarily by Douglas, whose Northern Army Corps comprised around 26,600 men who had been mobilised to guard the Swedish border with Finland in case the Russians invaded. He reasoned that the best way he could defend Sweden was to move into Finland and meet the Russians there. When the Russians had reached a certain point inside Finland, the whole Northern Army Corps would move across the border and take up positions along the Kemi river, all without approval of the Swedish government.

The fact that the Swedish government did not get news of Douglas&#x27; plan right away makes it entirely possible that the plan could have been implemented. However, when they found out the plan was scrapped although Douglas was allowed to retain command and later rose to become Chief of the Army.

The Northern Army Corps, barred from entering Finland, did not end attempts at aid, however. Swedish first line units would sometimes lose equipment and material that was needed on the other side of the border. The willingness to help out can be traced to officers in charge of Swedish supply units likening the Swedish Army Stores at Boden as a Finnish supply base.

It is known that at least 15,000 Swedes volunteered to fight alongside the Finns, with 10,000 accepted for training and 8,000 actually went to Finland in organised units before the war ended, which can be compared to the largest contributor to the International brigades, France, during the entire Spanish Civil War. In addition, a smaller number of individuals joined the Finnish army units or operated mechanical shops repairing equipment, mainly in the Swedish speaking south of Finland. The Swedish government and public also sent food, clothing, medicine, weapons and ammunition to aid the Finns during this conflict. The military aid included:
* 135,402 rifles, 347 machine guns, 450 light machine guns with 50,013,300 rounds of small arms ammunition;
* 144 field guns, 100 anti-aircraft guns and 92 anti-armour guns with 301,846 shells;
* 300 sea mines and 500 depth charges;
* 17 fighter aircraft, 5 light bombers, 1 DC-2 transport aircraft turned into bomber, and 3 reconnaissance aircraft, totally comprising 1/3 of the Swedish air force at the time.

According to Krister Wahlbäck, the Finnish government retrospectively complained about Sweden&#x27;s passivity: any help had not only been insufficient, but also for the most part come from the military industry&#x27;s own initiative.

Several books written about the Winter War include reference to the Swedish volunteers and many older Finns today still acknowledge their contributions.

== Aftermath ==
The Winter War also helped reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland had been as much about aiding a neighbour as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; if they had not gone to war to defend Finland, there was no way that they would do it for Norway. The last surviving Swedish veteran of the war, Bengt Essén, died in August 2020.

<text>Mount Tyree (4852m) is the second highest mountain of Antarctica located 13 kilometres northwest of Mount Vinson (4,892 m), the highest peak on the continent. It surmounts Patton Glacier to the north and Cervellati Glacier to the southeast.

==History==
Mt. Tyree was discovered in January 1958 during reconnaissance flights by the United States Navy VX-6 squadron, and mapped later that month by the Marie Byrd Land Traverse Party. The mountain was named for Rear Admiral David M. Tyree, who was commander of the U.S. Naval Support Force in Antarctica, from April 14, 1959 to November 26, 1962.

As of 2017, the summit had only been reached on six occasions, by a total of fifteen people, via three different routes: in January 1967 by John Evans and Barry Corbet (of Corbet&#x27;s Couloir); in January 1989 by Terry ‘Mugs’ Stump; in 1997 by French alpinists Antoine de Choudens and Antoine Cayrol; and later in 1997 by Conrad Anker and Alex Lowe. On January 3, 2012 Hans Kammerlander, Robert Miller and Christian Stangl repeated the French route to make the fifth ascent. Out of fifteen mountaineers who successfully climbed Mt Tyree, three died in unrelated mountaineering accidents within four years of their respective ascents. The still-unclimbed south face is high and one of the largest walls in Antarctica.

On January 16, 2017, five climbers made the sixth ascent of Mt. Tyree by the Grand Couloir (French route). The Tyree 50/50 expedition included Richard Thurmer, Jr, Victor Saunders, Maria &quot;Pachi&quot; Paz Ibarra, Seth Timpano and Todd Tumolo. Richard Thurmer is the first amateur climber and second oldest man (age 61) to make the summit. Victor Saunders is the oldest man to summit Mt. Tyree (age 66). Maria &quot;Pachi&quot; Paz Ibarra is the first woman to reach the summit. The Tyree 50/50 expedition of January 2017 was the 50th anniversary of the first summit in January 1967 and the team increased the number of climbers on the summit by 50%.

On January 1, 2022, Jenn Drummond became the first American woman and only the second woman to summit the mountain. Jenn&#x27;s team members were Sebastian Grau-Kunhardt, Todd Passey, Sam Hennessey and Rob Smith

The climbing season is November to January, when the sun is above the horizon 24 hours a day and the air is warmest—up to near the summit. Like the nearby Mount Vinson, the mountain may be accessed by means of a 6-hour flight from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Union Glacier Camp followed by a 200 km flight on a ski plane to the base of the mountain.

<doc id="644488" wikidata="Q914299" url="?curid=644488" title="Spin foam">
<text>In physics, the topological structure of spinfoam or spin foam&lt;ref name=&quot;url[gr-qc/0409061] Introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity and Spin Foams&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two-dimensional faces representing a configuration required by functional integration to obtain a Feynman&#x27;s path integral description of quantum gravity. These structures are employed in loop quantum gravity as a version of quantum foam.

==In loop quantum gravity==
The covariant formulation of loop quantum gravity provides the best formulation of the dynamics of the theory of quantum gravity – a quantum field theory where the invariance under diffeomorphisms of general relativity applies. The resulting path integral represents a sum over all the possible configurations of spin foam.

===Spin network===

A spin network is a two-dimensional graph, together with labels on its vertices and edges which encode aspects of a spatial geometry. 

A spin network is defined as a diagram like the Feynman diagram which makes a basis of connections between the elements of a differentiable manifold for the Hilbert spaces defined over them, and for computations of amplitudes between two different hypersurfaces of the manifold. Any evolution of the spin network provides a spin foam over a manifold of one dimension higher than the dimensions of the corresponding spin network. A spin foam is analogous to quantum history.

===Spacetime===

Spin networks provide a language to describe the quantum geometry of space. Spin foam does the same job for spacetime.

Spacetime can be defined as a superposition of spin foams, which is a generalized Feynman diagram where instead of a graph, a higher-dimensional complex is used. In topology this sort of space is called a 2-complex. A spin foam is a particular type of 2-complex, with labels for vertices, edges and faces. The boundary of a spin foam is a spin network, just as in the theory of manifolds, where the boundary of an n-manifold is an (n-1)-manifold.

In loop quantum gravity, the present spin foam theory has been inspired by the work of Ponzano–Regge model. The idea was introduced by Reisenberger and Rovelli in 1997, and later developed into the Barrett–Crane model. The formulation that is used nowadays is commonly called EPRL after the names of the authors of a series of seminal papers, but the theory has also seen fundamental contributions from the work of many others, such as Laurent Freidel (FK model) and Jerzy Lewandowski (KKL model).

==Definition==
The summary partition function for a spin foam model is 

formula_1

with:

* a set of 2-complexes formula_2 each consisting out of faces formula_3, edges formula_4 and vertices formula_5. Associated to each 2-complex formula_2 is a weight formula_7
* a set of irreducible representations formula_8 which label the faces and intertwiners formula_9 which label the edges.
* a vertex amplitude formula_10 and an edge amplitude formula_11
* a face amplitude formula_12, for which we almost always have formula_13

<text>Lindy Cameron Ruff (born February 17, 1960) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player who is the head coach for the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL). Ruff was previously the head coach of the Sabres from 1997 to 2013, winning the Jack Adams Award in 2006, and has also served as head coach of the Dallas Stars and New Jersey Devils. During his playing career, Ruff played in the NHL for the Sabres and New York Rangers, the former of which he captained.

Internationally, Ruff was an assistant coach for the Canadian national team at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, winning gold medals at both.

==Playing career==
Ruff was chosen in the second round, 32nd overall, of the 1979 NHL entry draft, by the Buffalo Sabres. He played for the Sabres and New York Rangers. Ruff gained a reputation as a player for his toughness, character, and hard work on the ice. An illustration of this came in a May 10, 1980, playoff game against the New York Islanders, when opposing goaltender Billy Smith struck Ruff with his stick as he passed in front of his net. Ruff got up, skated back to the goaltender, and tackled him.

Ruff played most of his NHL career for the Sabres, serving as captain of the team for nearly three years, but he was traded to the Rangers at the 1989 NHL trade deadline in exchange for a draft pick. The Sabres would use that pick to select Richard Šmehlík, who would later play for several years under Ruff.

Ruff played in 691 NHL games, scoring 105 goals and adding 195 assists for a total of 300 points. He also recorded 1,264 penalty minutes. In 52 playoff games, Ruff recorded 11 goals and 13 assists while accumulating 193 penalty minutes.

==Coaching career==
===Assistant coach===
Ruff became assistant coach of the Florida Panthers for the 1993–94 season until the 1996–97 season. His greatest success as an assistant coach was with the 1995–96 Florida Panthers, who made it to the Stanley Cup Finals before losing to the Colorado Avalanche in a four-game sweep.

===Buffalo Sabres (first tenure)===
Ruff was named the 15th head coach of the Buffalo Sabres on July 21, 1997. He joined a long list of former Sabres players who eventually became Sabres head coaches: Floyd Smith, Bill Inglis, Craig Ramsay, Jim Schoenfeld and Rick Dudley. He had immediate success in Buffalo, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals in the 1997–98 season.

In Ruff&#x27;s second season as coach, the Sabres reached the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals before losing to the Dallas Stars in six games. The Stars&#x27; Brett Hull scored a goal deep into the third overtime. The following two seasons saw Ruff&#x27;s Sabres lose in the first round to the Philadelphia Flyers and the second round to the Pittsburgh Penguins, respectively.

Buffalo missed the playoffs in the three seasons preceding the 2004–05 NHL lockout amidst the team&#x27;s bankruptcy and financial problems caused by the Adelphia Communications corporate scandal. After the lockout, Ruff led the Sabres to back-to-back Eastern Conference Finals appearances only to lose to the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006 and the Ottawa Senators in 2007. Ruff was the longest-tenured coach in the NHL and was rewarded with a three-year contract extension that had an option for a fourth season.

Ruff is known for being blunt with the media. A well-known example of his bluntness was his comments regarding Toronto Maple Leafs player Darcy Tucker. In his post-game interview following a questionable hit on Jochen Hecht, that knocked the Sabres centre out of the lineup for two weeks with a sprained ACL in the 2005–06 season, Ruff said, &quot;I want him [Tucker] suspended.&quot; He also said, &quot;I have not called the NHL office all year and I will call them ten times tomorrow.&quot; He called Tucker&#x27;s hit &quot;an absolute joke&quot;.

On April 5, 2006, Ruff became the 31st coach in NHL history to win 300 games, and just the 16th to do so with only one team. Ruff led the Sabres to their most successful regular season ever in 2006–07 with a 53–22–7 record for a total of 113 points.

Ruff was the winner of the 2005–06 Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in the NHL. Tom Renney of the New York Rangers and Peter Laviolette of the Carolina Hurricanes were also nominated. Ruff won by one vote over then Cup-winning coach Laviolette in what is the closest vote in the award&#x27;s history.

Ruff was again nominated for the Jack Adams Award in 2006–07. His nomination was the second time he has been a finalist for coach of the year. Alain Vigneault of the Vancouver Canucks won the honour; Ruff placed second in voting with 126 points to Vigneault&#x27;s 134.

In February 2007, Ruff was fined US$10,000 by the NHL after a brawl with the Ottawa Senators. The NHL said Ruff precipitated the brawl following a questionable hit on then co-captain Chris Drury by the Senators&#x27; Chris Neil. Because the hit to Drury did not result in a penalty, Ruff sent out Andrew Peters, Patrick Kaleta and Adam Mair, the team&#x27;s &quot;enforcers&quot;. What followed was one of the 2006–07 season&#x27;s most memorable hockey brawls. Mair began the brawl, punching Ottawa&#x27;s Jason Spezza as soon as the puck was dropped. Peters tried to start a fight with Dany Heatley, who was reluctant to respond, at one point even hiding behind a linesman. The goaltenders also entered the fight, with Martin Biron challenging Ray Emery, and Ruff himself engaged in a prolonged shouting match with Senators head coach Bryan Murray. A large contingent of Sabres fans attempted to raise money to pay the fine on Ruff&#x27;s behalf. Ruff declined the fans&#x27; offer and had the money raised donated to charity.

After a second-round playoff match against the New York Rangers on April 27, 2007, Ruff would be fined again by the NHL after harshly criticizing officials for an alleged missed too-many-men call against the Rangers, which might have given Buffalo a chance to tie the match in the closing minute.

In the 2006–07 season, Ruff became the first Sabres coach to lead the team to back-to-back 50-win seasons, boasting the fifth-best points percentage in the NHL since 1979.

On October 15, 2008, Ruff became the 23rd coach in NHL history to win 400 games, and just the seventh to win 400 games for one team.

Ruff was named as an associate coach for Canada, which won the gold medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

On January 6, 2011, Ruff became only the 16th coach in NHL history to win 500 games, and just the second to win 500 games while only having coached one team.

On January 8, 2011, Ruff became the winningest coach who only coached for one team in NHL history when the Sabres defeated the Phoenix Coyotes 2–1 in overtime. His 501st win behind the bench with the Sabres put him one ahead of Toe Blake, who coached to 500 wins with the Montreal Canadiens. Al Arbour won more games for the New York Islanders, but he also coached the St. Louis Blues early in his career. Along with Arbour, Billy Reay and Barry Trotz, Ruff is one of just four coaches to coach 1,000 NHL games with a single team.

On April 29, 2011, the Sabres announced Ruff had agreed to a multiple-year contract extension.

On February 20, 2013, the Sabres announced Ruff had been relieved of his coaching duties, ending his tenure as the NHL&#x27;s longest active-serving coach with one team and second only to Gregg Popovich in the four major sports in North America. Ron Rolston, head coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Rochester Americans, was named as his replacement.

===Dallas Stars===
On June 20, 2013, the Dallas Stars announced they were in the process of hiring Ruff as head coach. This was also on the anniversary of the controversial defeat of the Sabres in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1999. On June 21, 2013, the Stars announced Ruff would be their new head coach.

In 2014, Ruff led the Stars to their first playoff appearance since 2008, but lost in the opening round to the Anaheim Ducks in six games. Ruff served as the head coach of the Central Division squad in the 2015–16 All-Star Game.

On April 9, 2017, the Stars announced Ruff would not return as head coach for the 2017–18 season.

===New York Rangers===
On July 10, 2017, it was announced Ruff was named as assistant coach of the New York Rangers.

===New Jersey Devils===
On July 9, 2020, Ruff was named head coach of the New Jersey Devils. On January 28, 2021, Ruff coached his 1,500th game in the NHL as the Devils lost 3–1 to the Philadelphia Flyers. The Devils had been engaged in a rebuilding phase in the leadup to Ruff&#x27;s hiring, with the expectation that they would soon compete for the playoffs again, but the team continued to struggle during his first two seasons with the team, finishing near the bottom of the standings in each. The 2021–22 season had begun with some hopes based on offseason acquisitions and the maturation of young star players, but the team was plagued by injuries, using a franchise record seven different goaltenders over its 82 games.

Questions continued to surround Ruff&#x27;s job security heading into the 2022–23 season, with some suspecting that the hiring of former Florida Panthers coach and Jack Adams Award finalist Andrew Brunette as an assistant coach presaged him replacing Ruff at some point in the season. After the Devils lost their first two games of the season in a manner much resembling the prior years, chants of &quot;Fire Lindy!&quot; broke out at the Prudential Center. However, the team&#x27;s fortunes changed rapidly, and by the end of October, they were embarking on a lengthy winning streak that would carry them into first place in the Metropolitan Division. On November 12, after a 4–2 victory over the Arizona Coyotes, the team&#x27;s ninth consecutive, the audience chanted &quot;Sorry Lindy!&quot; Ruff said afterwards &quot;I accept the apology and maybe one day we can all sit down and have a beer and laugh about it.&quot; The team&#x27;s winning streaking would ultimately extend to 13 games, equaling the franchise record. On November 26, 2022, Ruff became the fifth NHL coach to win 800 games after a 5–1 against the Washington Capitals. The Devils ultimately finished third in the NHL, and second in their division, with a 52–22–8 record. Ruff was again named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award. On May 17, 2023, Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald announced that Ruff would be retained as team&#x27;s head coach after his contract expired at the end the 2022–23 season.

On October 11, 2023, the Devils signed Ruff to a multi-year contract extension. On December 16, Ruff recorded his 850th NHL regular season win and passed Ken Hitchcock for fourth place in all-time NHL regular season wins. On March 4, 2024, the Devils fired Ruff and replaced him with Travis Green on interim basis.

===Return to Buffalo===
On April 22, 2024, Ruff was re-hired as head coach of the Sabres, replacing Don Granato.

==Personal life==
Ruff&#x27;s younger brother, Brent Ruff, was one of four teammates killed in a bus crash while playing for the Swift Current Broncos in 1986.

Another younger brother, Marty Ruff, was a first-round draft pick of the St. Louis Blues but never appeared in an NHL game.

An older brother, Randy Ruff, played and coached in junior hockey.

Ruff and his wife Gaye have four children: Brett, Eryn, and twins Madeline and Brian. The Ruffs&#x27; primary residence is in Clarence, New York.

<text>The Stonycreek River (also referred to as Stony Creek) is a tributary of the Conemaugh River, approximately 45 mi (72 km) long, in southwestern Pennsylvania, United States.

==Course==

It rises in the mountains of eastern Somerset County from the headwater spring, Pius Spring, in Berlin, and flows north past Shanksville, Stoystown, Hooversville, and Ferndale. It joins the Little Conemaugh River at Johnstown to form the Conemaugh River. Additional variant names include: Achsinne-hanne, Gordon, and Sinne-hanna.

The river basin is in a highly scenic area but had been considered among the most degraded in the state, largely as the result of acid mine drainage from the long history of coal mining in the region. The recovery of the river has been an ongoing project of federal, state, and private agencies, and continues to progress. In recent decades, the river has become a popular destination for trout fishing.

==Recreation==

Following the sale of the Quemahoning Reservoir by Bethlehem Steel Corporation to the Cambria Somerset Authority, there have been periodic releases of water into the Stonycreek in order to facilitate whitewater rafting as an additional recreational opportunity. As of early 2010, there was a proposal to substantially increase discharges from the reservoir to improve whitewater rafting on the Stonycreek River.

<doc id="644492" wikidata="Q411347" url="?curid=644492" title="Amlodipine">
<text>Amlodipine, sold under the brand name Norvasc among others, is a calcium channel blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure, coronary artery disease (CAD) and variant angina (also called Prinzmetal angina or coronary artery vasospasm, among other names). It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth).
Common side effects include swelling, feeling tired, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure or heart attack. Whether use is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. When used by people with liver problems, and in elderly individuals, doses should be reduced. Amlodipine works partly by vasodilation (relaxing the arteries and increasing their diameter). It is a long-acting calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type.
Amlodipine was patented in 1982, and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the fifth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 70million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.

== Medical uses ==
Amlodipine is used in the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) and coronary artery disease in people with either stable angina (where chest pain occurs mostly after physical or emotional stress) or vasospastic angina (where it occurs in cycles) and without heart failure. It can be used as either monotherapy or combination therapy for the management of hypertension or coronary artery disease. Amlodipine can be administered to adults and to children 6–17 years of age. 

Calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, may provide greater protection against stroke than beta blockers. Evidence from two meta-analyses has reported no significant difference between calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers in stroke protection while one 2015 meta-analysis has suggested that calcium channel blockers offer greater protection against stroke than other classes of antihypertensive.

Amlodipine along with other calcium channel blockers are considered the first choice in the pharmacological management of Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon.

===Combination therapy===
Amlodipine can be given as a combination therapy with a variety of medications:
* Amlodipine/atorvastatin, where amlodipine is given for hypertension or CAD and atorvastatin prevents cardiovascular events, or if the person also has high cholesterol.
* Amlodipine/aliskiren or amlodipine/aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide if amlodipine alone cannot reduce blood pressure. Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor, which works to reduce primary hypertension (that with no known cause) by binding to renin and preventing it from initiating the renin–angiotensin system (RAAS) pathway to increase blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and decreases overall blood volume.
* Amlodipine/benazepril if either drug has failed individually, or amlodipine alone caused edema. Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor and blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the RAAS pathway.
* Amlodipine/celecoxib
* Amlodipine/lisinopril
* Amlodipine/olmesartan or amlodipine/olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide if amlodipine is insufficient in reducing blood pressure. Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and blocks part of the RAAS pathway.
* Amlodipine/perindopril if using amlodipine alone caused edema. Perindopril is a long-lasting ACE inhibitor.
* Amlodipine/telmisartan, where telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
* Amlodipine/valsartan or amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, where valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist.

== Contraindications ==
The only absolute contraindication to amlodipine is an allergy to amlodipine or any other dihydropyridines.

Other situations occur, however, where amlodipine generally should not be used. In patients with cardiogenic shock, where the heart&#x27;s ventricles are not able to pump enough blood, calcium channel blockers exacerbate the situation by preventing the flow of calcium ions into cardiac cells, which is required for the heart to pump. While use in patients with aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aorta where it meets the left ventricle) since it does not inhibit the ventricle&#x27;s function is generally safe, it can still cause collapse in cases of severe stenosis. In unstable angina (excluding variant angina), amlodipine can cause a reflex increase in cardiac contractility (how hard the ventricles squeeze) and heart rate, which together increase the demand for oxygen by the heart itself. Patients with severe hypotension can have their low blood pressure exacerbated, and patients in heart failure can get pulmonary edema. Those with impaired liver function are unable to metabolize amlodipine to its full extent, giving it a longer half-life than typical.

Amlodipine&#x27;s safety in pregnancy has not been established, although reproductive toxicity at high doses is known. Whether amlodipine enters the milk of breastfeeding mothers is also unknown.

Those who have heart failure, or recently had a heart attack, should take amlodipine with caution.

== Adverse effects ==

Some common dose-dependent adverse effects of amlodipine include vasodilatory effects, peripheral edema, dizziness, palpitations, and flushing. Peripheral edema (fluid accumulation in the tissues) occurs at rate of 10.8% at a 10-mg dose (versus 0.6% for placebos), and is three times more likely in women than in men. It causes more dilation in the arterioles and precapillary vessels than the postcapillary vessels and venules. The increased dilation allows for more blood, which is unable to push through to the relatively constricted postcapillary venules and vessels; the pressure causes much of the plasma to move into the interstitial space. Amlodipine-association edema can be avoided by adding ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Of the other dose-dependent side effects, palpitations (4.5% at 10 mg vs. 0.6% in placebos) and flushing (2.6% vs. 0%) occurred more often in women; dizziness (3.4% vs. 1.5%) had no sex bias.

Common but not dose-related adverse effects are fatigue (4.5% vs. 2.8% with a placebo), nausea (2.9% vs. 1.9%), abdominal pain (1.6% vs. 0.3%), and drowsiness (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Side effects occurring less than 1% of the time include: blood disorders, impotence, depression, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, tachycardia, gingival enlargement, hepatitis, and jaundice.

Amlodipine-associated gingival overgrowth is a relatively common side effect with exposure to amlodipine. Poor dental health and buildup of dental plaque are risk factors.

Amlodipine may increase the risk of worsening angina or acute myocardial infarction, especially in those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, upon dosage initiation or increase. However, depending on the situation, amlodipine inhibits constriction and restores blood flow in coronary arteries as a result of its acting directly on vascular smooth muscle, causing a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and a consequent reduction in blood pressure.

Amlodipine and other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are associated with primary open angle glaucoma.

== Overdose ==

Although rare, amlodipine overdose toxicity can result in widening of blood vessels, severe low blood pressure, and fast heart rate. Toxicity is generally managed with fluid replacement monitoring ECG results, vital signs, respiratory system function, glucose levels, kidney function, electrolyte levels, and urine output. Vasopressors are also administered when low blood pressure is not alleviated by fluid resuscitation.

== Interactions ==
Several drugs interact with amlodipine to increase its levels in the body. CYP3A inhibitors, by nature of inhibiting the enzyme that metabolizes amlodipine, CYP3A4, are one such class of drugs. Others include the calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, the antibiotic clarithromycin, and possibly some antifungals. Amlodipine causes several drugs to increase in levels, including cyclosporine, simvastatin, and tacrolimus (the increase in the last one being more likely in people with CYP3A5*3 genetic polymorphisms). When more than 20 mg of simvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent, are given with amlodipine, the risk of myopathy increases. The FDA issued a warning to limit simvastatin to a maximum dose of 20 mg if taken with amlodipine based on evidence from the SEARCH trial. Giving amlodipine with Viagra increases the risk of hypotension.

== Pharmacology ==
Amlodipine is a long-acting calcium channel antagonist that selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes. It targets L-type calcium channels in muscle cells and N-type calcium channels in the central nervous system which are involved in nociceptive signalling and pain perception. Amlodipine has an inhibitory effect on calcium influx in smooth muscle cells to inhibit contraction.

Amlodipine ends up significantly reducing total vascular resistance without decreasing cardiac output expressed by pressure-rate product and cardiac contractability in comparison with verapamil, a non-dihydropyridine. In turn, following treatment lasting a month, with amlodipine, cardiac output is significantly enhanced. Unlike verapamil which has efficacy in moderation of emotional arousal and reduces cardiac load without lowering cardiac output demands, amlodipine increases the cardiac output response concomitantly with increased functional cardiac load.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Amlodipine is an angioselective calcium channel blocker and inhibits the movement of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells which inhibits the contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle cells. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation and a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, thus lowering blood pressure. Its effects on cardiac muscle also prevent excessive constriction in the coronary arteries.

Negative inotropic effects can be detected &quot;in vitro&quot;, but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Among the two stereoisomers [&quot;R&quot;(+), &quot;S&quot;(–)], the (–) isomer has been reported to be more active than the (+) isomer. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. And it specifically inhibits the currents of -type Cav1.3 channels in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland.

The mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina are:
* Stable angina: amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, thereby lowering myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.
* Variant angina: amlodipine blocks spasm of the coronary arteries and restores blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium, epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels &quot;in vitro&quot;.

Amlodipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Amlodipine has been studied in healthy volunteers following oral administration of 14C-labelled drug. Amlodipine is well absorbed by the oral route with a mean oral bioavailability around 60%; the half-life of amlodipine is about 30 h to 50 h, and steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after 7 to 8 days of daily dosing. In the blood it has high plasma protein binding of 97.5%. Its long half-life and high bioavailability are largely in part of its high pKa (8.6); it is ionized at physiological pH, and thus can strongly attract proteins. It is slowly metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, with its amine group being oxidized and its side ester chain being hydrolyzed, resulting in an inactive pyridine metabolite. Renal elimination is the major route of excretion with about 60% of an administered dose recovered in urine, largely as inactive pyridine metabolites. However, renal impairment does not significantly influence amlodipine elimination. 20-25% of the drug is excreted in the faeces.

==History==
Pfizer&#x27;s patent protection on Norvasc lasted until 2007; total patent expiration occurred later in 2007. A number of generic versions are available. In the United Kingdom, tablets of amlodipine from different suppliers may contain different salts. The strength of the tablets is expressed in terms of amlodipine base, i.e., without the salts. Tablets containing different salts are therefore considered interchangeable. A fixed-dose combination of amlodipine and perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor is also available.

The medical form comes as besilate, mesylate, or maleate.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
In the US, Norvasc is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

== Veterinary use ==
Amlodipine is most often used to treat systemic hypertension in both cats and dogs. In cats, it is the first line of treatment due to its efficacy and few side effects. Systemic hypertension in cats is usually secondary to another abnormality, such as chronic kidney disease, and so amlodipine is most often administered to cats with kidney disease. While amlodipine is used in dogs with systemic hypertension, it is not as efficacious. Amlodipine is also used to treat congestive heart failure due to mitral valve regurgitation in dogs. By decreasing resistance to forward flow in the systemic circulation it results in a decrease in regurgitant flow into the left atrium. Similarly, it can be used on dogs and cats with left-to-right shunting lesions such as ventricular septal defect to reduce the shunt. Side effects are rare in cats. In dogs, the primary side effect is gingival hyperplasia.

<doc id="644494" wikidata="Q977529" url="?curid=644494" title="Climate Pledge Arena">
<text>Climate Pledge Arena is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is located north of downtown Seattle in the entertainment complex known as the Seattle Center, the site of the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair, for which it was originally developed. After opening in 1962, it was subsequently bought and converted by the city of Seattle for entertainment purposes. From 2018 to 2021, the arena underwent a $1.15 billion redevelopment; the renovation preserved the original exterior and roof, which was declared a Seattle Landmark in 2017 and was listed on the Washington Heritage Register as well as the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. The renovated venue has a capacity of 17,151 for ice hockey and 18,300 for basketball.

The arena is currently the home to the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Seattle Storm of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Seattle University Redhawks men&#x27;s basketball team, and the Rat City Roller Derby league of the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association. It has also played host to the Pac-12 Conference&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball tournament.

The arena was previously most notable as the long-time former home of the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The SuperSonics first played at the facility, then known as the Seattle Center Coliseum, from their founding in 1967 to 1978. After a seven-season stint in the higher capacity Kingdome, they returned to the arena in 1985. The facility underwent an extensive renovation after the 1993–94 season, which necessitated the relocation of SuperSonics home games to the Tacoma Dome for the 1994–95 season, and it was renamed KeyArena after KeyCorp bought the naming rights in 1995. The SuperSonics left KeyArena in 2008 amid a controversial relocation to Oklahoma City. The arena was also known for hosting minor professional hockey teams, first as home to the Seattle Totems of the original Western Hockey League and the Central Hockey League from 1964 to 1975, followed by the Seattle Thunderbirds of the current Western Hockey League from 1989 to 2008.

The arena was the first publicly financed one in the area that was fully supported by earned income from the building. Arena finances were bolstered for several years by a payment following the settlement with the SuperSonics in 2008, but the lower level of activity and revenue during the time between the departure of the team and the arrival of the NHL left little reserve beyond basic building maintenance. The naming rights deal with KeyCorp concluded at the end of 2010, but the building maintained the KeyArena name until its 2018 closure for the redevelopment. Amazon bought the naming rights to the arena in June 2020, dedicating the arena name to bringing attention to climate change, specifically the pledge promoted by the advocacy group Global Optimism for businesses to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2040.

==History==

===Seattle Center Coliseum===

The arena opened in 1962 as the Washington State Pavilion for the Century 21 Exposition, the work of architect Paul Thiry. After the close of the Exposition, the Pavilion was purchased by the city of Seattle for $2.9 million and underwent an 18-month conversion into the Washington State Coliseum, one of the centerpieces of the new Seattle Center on the former Exposition grounds. When the newly renovated Coliseum opened, the Seattle University men&#x27;s basketball team became the arena&#x27;s first major tenant. In 1964, the facility was renamed the Seattle Center Coliseum. That same year, the Seattle Totems moved into the Coliseum. The Coliseum became home to its most famous resident, the Seattle SuperSonics, beginning with their inaugural season in 1967 and remaining as host throughout most of the team&#x27;s lifetime.
The Coliseum in this incarnation hosted two NBA Finals, in 1978 and 1979, both between the Washington Bullets and SuperSonics. The Bullets won in 1978, prevailing in in Seattle. The Sonics retaliated the following year, winning in Game 5 on the Bullets&#x27; home court, thus capturing the franchise&#x27;s only championship. Upon the opening of the new Kingdome in 1976, which first hosted the NFL&#x27;s Seahawks and NASL&#x27;s Sounders followed by MLB&#x27;s expansion Mariners in 1977, the Sonics would begin playing a small number of home games at the stadium. For the championship 1978-79 season, the basketball club moved into the Kingdome full-time. They would call it home through the 1984–85 season, after which the team returned to the Coliseum. During those 7 years, the Sonics would occasionally play home playoff games at the Coliseum or Hec Edmundson Pavilion so as to not interfere with the Mariners&#x27; regular season home schedule. They would continue to play occasional games at the Kingdome through the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The arena hosted the NBA All-Star Game once, in 1974; the 1987 game had included NBA All-Star Saturday festivities on February 7, where former Sonics star &quot;Downtown Freddie&quot; Brown was the MVP of the legends game, Boston Celtics star Larry Bird won the three-point contest, and Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan won the slam-dunk competition. The NBA All-Star Game itself for 1987 in Seattle was held at the Kingdome.

The arena hosted the basketball competitions of the Goodwill Games in 1990.

In 1983, Barry Ackerley, head of the Washington, D.C.–based television, radio, and billboard company Ackerley Communications Inc., purchased the Sonics from long-time owner Sam Schulman. In the mid-to-late 1980s, the team&#x27;s on-court success would decline. This was coupled with a sub-par home court experience at the Coliseum, which included the NBA&#x27;s lone rain delayed game on January 5, 1986, when rain water leaked from the roof onto the court as the Sonics played the Phoenix Suns. Timeouts were called so ball boys armed with towels could do their best to wipe up the puddles, but even so, two players slipped and fell on the wet surface. Early in the second quarter, referee Mike Mathis called the game with the Suns up by eleven points. The game was resumed from that point the following night, and Phoenix won .

Ackerley began exploring new options for an arena. Heavy relocation rumors began to circulate, amongst them a potential move to San Diego or possible sales to groups in other markets like Milwaukee or Toronto. In 2018, Ackerley&#x27;s son Chris would say that the family was always committed to keeping the team in Seattle, and that &quot;[...] in each case, we stood on our principles that this is a Seattle community asset.&quot;

====Potential replacement by arena in SoDo====
In 1990, the Ackerleys talked about building an arena east of Lake Washington near Bellevue Square. They would eventually purchase land in the SoDo district near the Kingdome, some of which includes the site that would later become the Mariners&#x27; home, T-Mobile Park. Ackerley approached the city about a public contribution to the new arena, but the city was reluctant over fears the city-owned Coliseum would become obsolete. They offered to help finance a renovation of the Coliseum, but the team owner declined. To sweeten the offer, Ackerley sold city leaders on the idea that the new arena in SoDo could also attract a National Hockey League club. The city, along with Denver, had been conditionally granted an expansion NHL franchise in 1974 to begin play in the 1976–77 season. The NHL briefly flirted with relocating the Pittsburgh Penguins to Seattle (and the California Golden Seals to Denver) to address a troubled market and fill the expansion commitment, but ultimately kept the team there. Eventually, the Seattle franchise award was rescinded altogether when the potential ownership group was unable to secure the funds for the expansion fee.

In July 1990, the city council approved a deal for a privately owned $100 million facility to be built on the Ackerley land in SoDo, despite objections over traffic and parking by the Seahawks and Mariners in the neighboring Kingdome. The city&#x27;s contribution would be to waive about $31 million in tax revenues (about $1 million per year) to potentially be collected on admissions fees at the new arena. It would also pay $2 million for street improvements around the proposed site, including a pedestrian walkway over South Royal Brougham Way. Ackerley also agreed to sign a 30-year lease for the Sonics and to build an 1,800-stall parking garage. Ackerley appeased the Seahawks&#x27; concerns, noting the arena would be empty during any NFL games. The Mariners unsuccessfully continued to object, even enlisting then-Major League Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent and then-American League president Bobby Brown to speak before the council ahead of their final vote.

During negotiations, Ackerley had asked for a provision to reduce the seating at the Coliseum by 9,000 seats so the older arena could not compete with the new building, but the city would not agree. Another selling point of the new arena were luxury suites, a means to attract corporate money and sponsorship that was then an emerging new revenue stream for sports team owners. Ackerley&#x27;s financing and agreement with the city hinged on the ability to sell the 70 proposed luxury suites.

Ackerley also committed to submitting an expansion application to the NHL by a September 15, 1990, deadline as part of the arena deal. His son Bill would head the expansion effort, while a competing group led by Microsoft executive Chris Larson and former Seattle Totems player then coach Bill MacFarland was preparing their own application. With the Ackerley application already submitted, the two groups would merge with Larson and MacFarland being primary points of contact with the NHL. Then owner of the Seattle Thunderbirds, Bill Yuill, also joined the group. Larson and MacFarland, along with Barry Ackerley and Bill Lear, Ackerley&#x27;s financial advisor, were set to make a presentation to the NHL&#x27;s Board of Governors on December 5, 1990. At the meeting, Ackerley and Lear asked to meet with the board first, promptly withdrew their application, and left. Larson and MacFarland were stunned to learn of the development but were unable to pursue any recourse as their names were never on the submitted application.

Thought to play a factor in Ackerley&#x27;s decision were the significant demands by the NHL for an expansion team: a $50 million expansion fee that was more than any NHL club was valued at the time; a $5 million down payment that would be forfeited if 10,000 season tickets were not sold in the first year – the Sonics had never sold more than 9,000 season tickets; season tickets needed to produce at least $9 million annually, which would&#x27;ve made the tickets the second most expensive for a team in the area at the time; a 20-year lease with a &quot;substantial&quot; share of arena revenues from concessions, parking, and ad signage; priority status for postseason arena dates; and a secured $5 million line of credit in case the league had to take over ownership of the team at any point. Ackerley would not sacrifice Sonics revenues for a hockey team in which he would be a minority investor.

In June 1991, nearly a year after the city agreed to the arena deal, Ackerley announced that the project would not move forward. Increasing project costs, legal disputes, and inability to secure construction financing were cited as reasons to drop the project. Only around 30 of the 70 luxury suites were sold and the Ackerleys were unable to find a corporate buyer for naming rights. Ackerley Communications profits were down, which also contributed to the financing difficulties. A state Supreme Court case brought by Seattle Center employees challenged the constitutionality of the arena deal, while potential lawsuits from the Mariners and trade show organizers and possible legal challenges to environmental review of the project loomed.

===Rebirth as KeyArena===

Newly elected Seattle mayor Norm Rice was concerned over a loss of concerts and events to cities with larger, more modern facilities, and the strong possibility the city could lose the Sonics. The mayor believed that sports unite a community and that Seattle Center would continue to serve as a valuable hub for tourism. At his insistence, a Center commission developed a plan to renovate the Coliseum by excavating the floor to lower it and build a new bowl with more seating. The Ackerleys turned down the renovation concept in favor of building their own arena in SoDo. Though the city preferred the renovation, they would reluctantly agree to the new arena plan. After the SoDo proposal fell through, the Ackerleys attempted to find other investors to no avail. Barry Ackerley would return to the city to ask if they would still consider renovating the Coliseum.
With renewed interest on all sides, including the city council, the city spent $250,000 studying if it was even environmentally and engineeringly feasible to dig into the ground beneath the building. The plan proved possible and it was found that the compression ring holding the roof could be preserved, saving $15 million in cost and keeping the facility seismically sound against earthquakes. The original cable-suspended roof would be replaced by a conventional fixed roof with steel trusses that would preserve the well-known shape.

The project had an estimated cost of $73.4 million, considerably less than other new arenas of the time in Portland and Vancouver, to be paid with the city&#x27;s bond capacity. A new kitchen and support building, a parking garage on 1st Avenue N, a new team store, and a tunnel connecting the store to the arena brought the total cost to nearly $127.3 million. New amenities would include 22 concession stands, 8 portable stands with vending in the seating, three private sports clubs, and a public sports bar and restaurant. Club-level seating with 1,100 seats would also offer exclusive club, concession, and lounge areas, and a private concourse with 58 luxury suites would also be added.

A mandate of the project was that no taxpayer funds could be used to pay for it. This brought concern from the Ackerleys, but after nearly a year of negotiations a revenue sharing plan was developed. The city and the team would split revenues from suites, concessions, and other items all within the arena to service the debt for the city and provide income to the team. The arena would be the first to finance itself by use of the arena. In May 1993, the city council voted 7–2 in favor of the deal with the Sonics signing a 15-year lease agreement and a guaranteed income of $7 million per year during the lease. The agreement was initially turned down in council committee in the hopes of negotiating a 20-year lease with an increased guaranteed income of $9 million per year starting in year 15. The Ackerleys declined these changes.

The Coliseum was rebuilt between 1994 and 1995, bringing the arena up to the NBA standards of the day. The local Seattle office of NBBJ, the second largest architectural firm in the country, was chosen as the architects. In an unusual move, the Coliseum would be closed for a year during the renovation. Construction began on June 16, 1994. During the 1994–95 season, the SuperSonics played their home games at the multi-purpose Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, about south.

On April 11, 1995, the city sold the naming rights to Cleveland-based KeyCorp, the parent of KeyBank, which renamed the Coliseum as KeyArena. The renovation cost the city of Seattle $74.5 million and the SuperSonics approximately $21 million. The naming rights cost KeyCorp $15.1 million.

The remodeled arena maintained the architectural integrity of the original roofline by using the existing steel trusses in combination with four new main diagonal trusses. The wood, steel and concrete from the demolition was either reused in construction of the new arena or sold to recyclers. The original acoustical panels, the panels attached to the roof that keep the space from echoing, were refurbished and reused. The court was lowered below street level to allow for 3,000 more seats. The doors opened to the newly renovated arena on October 26, 1995. The sightlines, however, benefitted the SuperSonics at the expense of the junior Thunderbirds. The floor was just barely large enough to fit a regulation ice rink. Many seats in the lower level were so badly obstructed that almost half the lower level was curtained off for T-Birds games. The new scoreboard was significantly off-center in the ice hockey configuration, hanging over one blue line instead of the center-ice faceoff circle.

The first regular season game for the SuperSonics at the rechristened KeyArena was played on November 4, 1995, against the Los Angeles Lakers. The renovated arena hosted the 1996 NBA Finals in its first season, when the SuperSonics lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games.

====Seattle SuperSonics relocation controversy====
In 2001, ownership of the Seattle SuperSonics (who had called KeyArena home on-and-off since their establishment in 1967) transferred from Barry Ackerley to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Schultz claimed that in the five years he owned the SuperSonics, the team suffered heavy financial losses, which led him to seek funding from the Washington State Legislature for a newer, more modern arena. After failing to reach an agreement with the city of Seattle over a publicly funded $220 million expansion of KeyArena, the Basketball Club of Seattle, led by Schultz, put the SuperSonics and its sister team, the WNBA&#x27;s Seattle Storm up for sale. After failing to find a local ownership group to sell the team to, Schultz talked to ownership groups from Kansas City, St. Louis, Las Vegas, San Jose and Anaheim before agreeing to sell the team on July 18, 2006 to an ownership group from Oklahoma City, who was pursuing an NBA franchise after hosting the New Orleans Hornets franchise successfully for two seasons as the city of New Orleans rebuilt from Hurricane Katrina. The sale to Clay Bennett&#x27;s ownership group, Professional Basketball Club LLC (PBC) for $350 million was approved by NBA owners on October 24, 2006. Terms of the sale required the new ownership group to &quot;use good faith best efforts&quot; for a term of 12 months in securing a new arena lease or venue in the Seattle metropolitan area.

In 2006, 74% of voters in Seattle voted to pass Initiative 91, a measure that prohibited use of tax dollars on arena projects in the city unless it could be shown the city would turn a profit on their investment. The limitation of tax dollars that could be spent on the arena, combined with earlier losses under recent ownership groups, &quot;likely doomed the Sonics&#x27; future in the city&quot;.

On February 12, 2007, Bennett proposed using tax money to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal by the end of the legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007, the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its KeyArena lease. Seattle&#x27;s mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett&#x27;s group. Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative. On August 13, 2007, Aubrey McClendon, a minor partner of Bennett&#x27;s ownership group, said in an interview with &quot;The Journal Record&quot; (an Oklahoma City newspaper) that the team was not purchased to keep it in Seattle but to relocate it to Oklahoma City. Bennett later denied such intentions, saying McClendon &quot;was not speaking on behalf of the ownership group&quot;. Due to his comments, McClendon was fined $250,000 by the NBA.

On October 31, 2007, Bennett informed NBA commissioner David Stern that the ownership group intended to move the Sonics to Oklahoma City as soon as it was legally possible. The timing of the announcement, one day after the Sonics&#x27; home opener, drew critical comments from Tom Carr, Seattle&#x27;s attorney, who said &quot;Mr. Bennett&#x27;s announcement today is a transparent attempt to alienate the Seattle fan base and follow through on his plan to move the team to Oklahoma City ... Making this move now continues the current ownership&#x27;s insulting behavior toward the Sonics&#x27; dedicated fans and the citizens of the city.&quot; Bennett also reiterated that the team was not for sale and dismissed attempts by local groups to repurchase the team.

On September 23, 2007, the City of Seattle filed a lawsuit in an attempt to keep the Sonics from leaving before the end of their lease in 2010. In the midst of the lawsuit, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer offered to pay half of a $300 million renovation of KeyArena; the rest to be provided by the city and county. However, when the state legislature did not give approval for the county to provide funds by an April 10 deadline, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels said that the effort had failed and the city&#x27;s hopes rested in its lawsuit.

The last SuperSonics game played at KeyArena was on April 13, 2008, a 99–95 win over the Dallas Mavericks.

The NBA Board of Governors approved the relocation of the Sonics on April 18, 2008.

On June 16, 2008, the grassroots organization &quot;Save Our Sonics&quot; organized a well-publicized rally, which reportedly drew over 3,000 participants, at the U.S. District Courthouse in Seattle to protest the proposed relocation of the team. The rally was held on the first day of the city of Seattle&#x27;s lawsuit against the PBC to enforce the remaining two years on the KeyArena lease.

On July 2, 2008, two hours before a ruling in the city&#x27;s lawsuit was to be given, it was announced that the team and the city had reached a settlement where PBC would pay the city $45 million immediately in exchange for breaking the lease, and an additional $30 million if Seattle was not given a replacement team in five years. According to the conditions of the settlement, the Sonics&#x27; name and colors could not be used by the team in Oklahoma City, but could be taken by a future team in Seattle, although no promises for a replacement team were given. The newly renamed Oklahoma City Thunder would retain the franchise history of the SuperSonics, which could be &quot;shared&quot; with any future NBA team in Seattle. The team moved to Oklahoma City immediately and announced it would begin play in the 2008–09 season.

====KeyArena after the Sonics====
Once KeyArena lost the SuperSonics and the Thunderbirds, who moved in 2008 as well, to nearby Kent, there was speculation that KeyBank may try to amend the naming rights deal. In March 2009, the city and KeyCorp signed a new deal for a two-year term ending December 31, 2010, at an annual fee of $300,000.

In 2009, the Seattle University Redhawks men&#x27;s basketball team began playing their home games at KeyArena for the first time since 1980. In February 2009, the Seattle City Council approved a new 10-year lease that would keep the WNBA&#x27;s Storm at KeyArena.

In 2009, the arena hosted the WWE No Way Out pay-per-view event. The WWE returned on March 9, 2010, to tape the March 9 episode of &quot;NXT&quot; and March 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. They would return a year later to host the WWE Over the Limit pay-per-view on May 22, 2011. In April 2011, the Professional Bull Riders brought the Built Ford Tough Series to KeyArena for the first time.

Between June 28 and 30, 2011, the arena hosted the Seattle audition stages in the first season of the Fox singer search program &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

On January 21, 2011, Seattle Center announced that KeyCorp would not renew its agreement for naming rights of KeyArena, after 15 years of sponsorship. However, the venue retained the KeyArena name until its redevelopment, despite the fact that the naming right had expired.

In January 2012, ESPN.com reporter Scott Burnside said KeyArena &quot;would be entirely acceptable&quot;, as a temporary venue for an NHL franchise, depending on a future arena plan. The Phoenix Coyotes were often speculated to be a likely candidate for relocation and in June 2013, reports circulated that if the NHL could not negotiate a new lease for the Coyotes with the city of Glendale, Arizona, by July 2, the league would sell the team to a private investment group which would then be given permission to relocate the team to Seattle prior to the 2013–2014 season and use KeyArena as a temporary home. On July 2, the city of Glendale, Arizona approved a new lease for the Coyotes at Jobing.com Arena, and soon after, the NHL approved the sale of the Coyotes to an investment group that would keep the Coyotes in the Phoenix area, eliminating the possibility that the Coyotes could move to Seattle.

Conversely, in February 2012, SB Nation columnist Travis Hughes said that while it made &quot;too much sense&quot; for the NHL not to put a team in Seattle in the future, KeyArena was completely unsuitable even as a temporary facility due to the same problems with sight lines that ultimately forced the Thunderbirds to move out. Hughes wrote that even one year of NHL hockey in an arena where half the lower bowl sat unused would be &quot;just unacceptable.&quot; He argued that the situation would be even worse than what the Coyotes faced at America West Arena, their original home in Phoenix. When the Coyotes played there from 1996 to 2003, they had to deal with seats where part of the ice could not be seen at all, forcing them to curtain off several thousand seats in the upper level.

League officials later hinted that a new arena would have to be in place before a new or relocated NHL team came to Seattle. During the 2012 All-Star Weekend, Bettman said that while Seattle was a good fit for the NHL, &quot;there&#x27;s no building.&quot; Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said that KeyArena would be &quot;a difficult arena for hockey&quot; due to the large number of obstructed-view seats.

In February 2012, KING 5 reporter Chris Daniels said an NBA team could also use KeyArena as a temporary home.

In July 2012, at a public town hall meeting debating Chris Hansen&#x27;s proposed NBA/NHL arena in downtown Seattle, anti-arena proponents wanted to &quot;re-explore&quot; using KeyArena instead of the proposed site downtown.

From 2014 to 2017, American video game developer Valve hosted The International, the world championship for &quot;Dota 2&quot; eSports, at the venue, which featured prize pools of over $20 million in 2016 and 2017. TI returned to the venue in 2023.

KeyArena hosted early rounds of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1999 and 2015.

On September 16, 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Gymnastics Champions.

Roger Federer organized a tennis exhibition match at KeyArena with Match for Africa 4, held on April 29, 2017. Two matches were played, the first a doubles match pitting Roger Federer and Bill Gates against John Isner and Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, and a singles match featuring Federer and Isner. More than $2 million was raised for the Roger Federer Foundation from the match&#x27;s proceeds.

On October 5, 2018, the Golden State Warriors played against the Sacramento Kings in a preseason game at KeyArena, the same arena where Kevin Durant played previously with the Sonics. The game was mostly played to celebrate its moments with the NBA and ended up being its final event as the KeyArena before the arena closed down for redevelopment.

===Redevelopment into Climate Pledge Arena, arrival of the NHL===

In October 2016, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced that the city would seek proposals to redevelop KeyArena into an NBA and NHL ready venue, issuing a full request for proposal in January. This came after the rejection of the new arena proposed in SoDo by Seattle City Council over the street vacation of Occidental Avenue.

Two groups, Seattle Partners (led by AEG and Hudson Pacific Properties) and the Oak View Group (led by former AEG CEO Tim Leiweke), submitted proposals to the city in April 2017 to redevelop the arena, also securing corporate partnerships and seeking the support of the NHL. Both groups were required to submit an additional proposal to preserve the arena&#x27;s roof, which the city planned to submit for municipal landmark status. AEG unveiled a $520 million proposal that would extend the roofline over presently underutilized space on the arena&#x27;s south end. Oak View Group submitted a $564 million proposal that would lower the arena&#x27;s bowl within the existing roof structure. On June 7, 2017, the city selected OVG as the preferred bidder for the redevelopment. The landmark status of the arena&#x27;s exterior, including the roof, was approved by a city-appointed landmarks preservation board on August 2, 2017; the exterior was subsequently listed on the Washington Heritage Register on March 8, 2018, and on the National Register of Historic Places on May 10.

On December 4, 2017, the city council approved a memorandum of understanding with OVG to rebuild the arena by 2020. The approval came days after the previous memorandum with the SODO Arena had expired. Four days after the approval of the MOU, the NHL gave the Oak View Group approval to submit an application for an expansion franchise in Seattle. The arena would be closed for two years, and the last remaining professional sports team tenant, the WNBA&#x27;s Seattle Storm, would plan to move elsewhere in the Seattle metropolitan area during those two years. The team played its usual summer schedule at KeyArena in 2018, beginning in mid-May and continuing through the playoffs in early September; they ultimately won the 2018 WNBA Finals. During the renovation, the Storm played most of their home games at the Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion on the campus of the University of Washington, with other games at Angel of the Winds Arena in Everett.
On September 25, 2018, the proposed $700 million renovation of KeyArena was approved unanimously by the Seattle City Council and signed into legislation by mayor The NHL Board of Governors voted to approve an expansion team for Seattle on December 4, 2018. Redevelopment commenced the next day on December 5. In mid-December 2018, OVG announced that overall project costs had increased to between $825 and $850 million. Although some design changes and additions had contributed to the increase in cost, OVG replaced the general contractor, Skanska Hunt, with Mortenson Construction.

With the closing of the arena in October 2018 to begin redevelopment, the City of Seattle, Seattle Center, and Oak View Group retired the KeyArena name and officially adopted Seattle Center Arena as the name for the project. It was alternately referred to as the New Arena at Seattle Center. In February 2018, it was reported that six interested parties had approached OVG regarding naming rights for the new arena. Alaska Airlines was announced as the naming sponsor of the south atrium in January 2020. On June 25, 2020, Amazon purchased the naming rights; the arena would be branded as Climate Pledge Arena to promote Amazon&#x27;s partnership with the environmental advocacy group Global Optimism and its &quot;Climate Pledge&quot;, under which companies sign up to make their operations carbon neutral by 2040. The renovated arena received carbon-neutral certification, uses rainwater for its hockey ice, and aims to source 75% of food locally, divert 95% of waste from landfills, donate unused food, and switched from plastic to compostable containers.

The rooftop signage for KeyArena was removed by a helicopter on July 8, 2020. The replacement signage was installed on December 5, 2020. During redevelopment, the arena&#x27;s existing roof was &quot;detached from 20 original concrete Y-columns and four gigantic buttresses that previously supported it&quot;, being held up by &quot;72 temporary steel columns, cross-beams and a steel reinforcement structure called a kickstand.” 600,000 cubic yards of dirt were removed during the excavation of the arena bowl, and the structure was then built upwards to connect with the roof.

Climate Pledge Arena was opened to the public on October 19, 2021, by a Foo Fighters and Death Cab for Cutie concert for local charities. The first scheduled event, a sold-out Coldplay concert, took place three days later on the 22nd. The first sports event at the renovated arena, a Seattle Kraken regular season game, took place on October 23 against the Vancouver Canucks. Kraken defenseman Vince Dunn scored the first NHL goal in the arena and the game ended in a 4–2 Kraken loss to the Canucks. The first Kraken win at the arena was on October 26, a 5–1 victory against the Montreal Canadiens. On May 6, 2022, the Seattle Storm played their first game at the redeveloped arena against the Minnesota Lynx, winning 97–74. For the first two months of the 2022–23 AHL season, Climate Pledge Arena hosted the Coachella Valley Firebirds, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Kraken, until their arena, Acrisure Arena in Palm Springs opened on December 14, 2022; the Firebirds&#x27; first game at the new arena came four days later.

On January 5, 2025, the first Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League (PWHL) game in Seattle was played at the arena between the Montreal Victoire and the Boston Fleet. Boston won 3–2 with 12,608 spectators in attendance.

==Sporting events==
===Mixed martial arts===
The arena has held several UFC events throughout its history, beginning with &quot;UFC Fight Night: Nogueira vs. Davis&quot; on March 26, 2011. The promotion returned to the arena on December 8, 2012 for &quot;UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Diaz&quot;. The UFC returned on July 27, 2013 for &quot;UFC on Fox: Johnson vs. Moraga&quot;. The UFC returned to the arena after twelve years on February 22, 2025 for &quot;UFC Fight Night: Cejudo vs. Song&quot;.

Elvis Presley performed at the arena on November 12, 1970, and April 26, 1976.

Metallica filmed the first of three live videos for their 1993 live concert box set Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge at the arena. The band recorded their performances from August 29 and August 30, 1989, during their Damaged Justice tour, widely considered one of the band&#x27;s greatest live performances by fans.

On April 24, and April 25, 2005 U2 performed at KeyArena as part of their Vertigo Tour. Kings of Leon was the opening act.

Destiny&#x27;s Child performed at the arena on September 9, 2005, during their Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin&#x27; It farewell tour. The show was the group&#x27;s second-to-last performance before they officially split up.

In 2012, Madonna performed two sold-out concerts at the venue as a part of The MDNA Tour. The shows drew 23,651 attendees and grossed $3.7 million.

Bruce Springsteen has performed at the arena five times. He and the E Street Band performed a nearly four-hour long concert during The River Tour 2016 on March 24, 2016. It included a guest appearance by Eddie Vedder. Springsteen returned to the newly renovated arena for a single performance on February 27, 2023, as part of his 2023 Tour.
In December 2013, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis became the first Seattle-based act ever to play three consecutive shows at KeyArena when the duo concluded their 2013 World Tour in support of their album The Heist.

Foo Fighters and Death Cab for Cutie performed at the first event in Climate Pledge Arena after its renovation on October 19, 2021.

Korean boy group Stray Kids performed on July 14 &amp; 15, 2022 as part of their North American arena tour for Maniac World Tour.

==Seating capacity==
In its initial configuration, the arena had a seating capacity of 13,200 for basketball games, 12,250 for ice hockey games, 16,000 for meetings, and 14,770 for boxing matches. Minor expansion occurred as the SuperSonics grew in popularity, but the design of the arena limited its expansion potential; calls for its renovation occurred as early as 1976.

In 1977, Seattle voters passed a bond measure to make improvements to Seattle Center. Permanent ticketing areas were added to the arena eliminating the portable ticket booths that were in use since The Seattle World&#x27;s Fair. In 1983, the original seats were replaced while improvements were made to the concourses to compete for concerts after the Tacoma Dome opened.

With the 1995 renovation, the arena&#x27;s capacity was expanded to 17,072 for basketball, 15,177 for ice hockey and ice shows, 16,641 for end-stage concerts, and 17,459 for center-stage concerts and boxing. Risers held 7,440 on the upper level and up to 7,741 on the lower level, with luxury suites adding another 1,160 seats. However, the ice hockey capacity was reduced to 10,442 when obstructed seats were removed.

The redeveloped arena features a new interior and entrance atrium while retaining the existing roof and three exterior walls. It seats 18,300 for basketball, 17,151 for ice hockey (as well as arena football, box lacrosse, indoor soccer, and ice shows), and 17,200 for concerts. The arena&#x27;s record attendance for basketball—18,343 spectators—was set on May 22, 2024, by the Seattle Storm against the Indiana Fever.

The seating capacity for basketball and ice hockey are as follows:


==Features and amenities==
The post-renovation Climate Pledge Arena is and has 17,100 seats in its ice hockey configuration, with higher capacities for other events. Most of the lower-level seats are subterranean, while the concourse and main south entrance at the Alaska Airlines Atrium are near ground level. The arena has several food vendors that use Amazon One for contactless payments.

The arena has a pair of six-sided ceiling scoreboards in lieu of the traditional single, center-hung scoreboard used in other indoor arenas. They were designed to not interfere with sightlines and are also positioned higher than other NHL scoreboards.

Concurrent with the announcement that the arena would be named Climate Pledge Arena, it was stated that the venue would aim to receive a net-zero certification by pledging to have all events be &quot;zero-waste&quot; (through use of compostable containers and reduction of single-use plastic), use captured rainwater for its ice surface, and source at least 75% of food served at the arena from local producers. All fans holding a ticket to a public event at the arena can claim a free public transit pass for use starting two hours before the doors open and until two hours after the end of the event. In the first year that the passes were available to Kraken and Storm ticketholders, 25% of fans used public transit.

==Transportation==
Climate Pledge Arena is located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood, which is served by King County Metro bus service from surrounding areas, including Queen Anne Hill and Downtown Seattle. The RapidRide D Line and other routes provide frequent service between the arena&#x27;s west side and Downtown Seattle. Route 8 connects the neighborhood to Capitol Hill and the Central District.

The Seattle Center Monorail also serves the arena, connecting it to Westlake Center and the Westlake light rail station in downtown, and runs higher frequency service during events.

Climate Pledge Arena is served by three public parking garages, with a total capacity of 2,944 vehicles, located in and around the Seattle Center. Additional neighborhood parking lots and on-street parking spaces bring the total number of spaces up to 7,400 stalls. The arena is located near the Mercer Street exit on Interstate 5, as well as State Route 99.

Link light rail service to the Seattle Center and Climate Pledge Arena is planned to begin in 2035, as part of the Ballard–Downtown extension.

<text>Trypanosomiasis or trypanosomosis is the name of several diseases in vertebrates caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosomes of the genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;. In humans this includes African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease. A number of other diseases occur in other animals.

Human African trypanosomiasis, which is caused by either &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot; or &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot;, is presently estimated to threaten over 40 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rural areas and populations affected by war or poverty. However, only 1.5 million people are estimated to live in areas at moderate or high risk, and for over 20 years the number of cases has been going down due to systematic surveillance and control efforts: in 1998 almost 40,000 cases were reported but almost 300,000 cases were suspected to have occurred; in 2009, the number dropped below 10,000; and in 2018 it dropped below 1000, and it has remained under that number ever since.

Chagas disease causes 21,000 deaths per year mainly in Latin America.

==Signs and symptoms==
The tsetse fly bite erupts into a red chancre sore and within a few weeks, the person can experience fever, swollen lymph glands, blood in urine, aching muscles and joints, headaches and irritability. In the first phase, the patient has only intermittent bouts of fever with lymphadenopathy together with other non-specific signs and symptoms. The second stage of the disease is marked by involvement of the central nervous system with extensive neurological effects like changes in personality, alteration of the biological clock (the circadian rhythm), confusion, slurred speech, seizures and difficulty in walking and talking. These problems can develop over many years and if not treated, the person dies. It is common in Subsaharan Africa.

==Diagnosis==
Cattle may show enlarged lymph nodes and internal organs. Haemolytic anaemia is a characteristic sign. Systemic disease and reproductive wastage are common, and cattle appear to waste away.

Horses with dourine show signs of ventral and genital edema and urticaria.

Infected dogs and cats may show severe systemic signs.

Diagnosis relies on recognition of the flagellate on a blood smear. Motile organisms may be visible in the buffy coat when a blood sample is spun down. Serological testing is also common.

One common way in which trypanosomiasis can be diagnosed in humans is through the detection of antibodies against trypanosomes made by host organisms. One commonly used antibody test which operated based on this principle is the card agglutination test, C.A.T.T. for T. gambiense. In this test, reagent is mixed with blood and shaken. Within a matter of minutes, a researcher or public health professional can determine whether someone has made these antibodies and therefore is infected with trypanosomes. Regarding the accuracy of this test, it is reported to have an 87 to 98 percent sensitivity rating.

Another way to diagnose trypanosomiasis in humans is to detect the trypanosome protozoans themselves. One way to do this would be to use lymph node aspirate. In this test, which has a sensitivity of between 40 and 80 percent, a healthcare worker will first find a cervical lymph node which is enlarged. Once the healthcare worker has punctured that lymph node, its aspirate is examined under a microscope for trypanosomes to confirm diagnosis.

==Prevention==

The use of trypanotolerant breeds for livestock farming should be considered if the disease is widespread. Fly control is another option but is difficult to implement. The main approaches to controlling African trypanosomiasis are to reduce the reservoirs of infection and the presence of the tsetse fly. Screening of people at risk helps identify patients at an early stage. Diagnosis should be made as early as possible and before the advanced stage to avoid complicated, difficult and risky treatment procedures.

==Treatment==
Stage I of the condition is usually treated with pentamidine or suramin through intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion if sufficient observation is possible. Stage II of the disease is typically treated with melarsoprol or eflornithine preferably introduced to the body intravenously. Both pentamidine and suramin have limited side effects. Melarsoprol is extremely effective but has many serious side effects which can cause neurological damage to a patient, however, the drug is often a patient&#x27;s last hope in many late stage cases. Eflornithine is extremely expensive but has side effects that may be treated with ease. In regions of the world where the disease is common eflornithine is provided for free by the World Health Organization.

== Epidemiology ==
Trypanosomes and trypanosomiasis disease is transmitted through the tsetse fly. As many as 90 percent of sleeping sickness cases are caused by the Glossina fuscipes subspecies of the fly. The palpalis subspecies contributes the majority of the rest of the cases. The different subspecies of fly dominate different habitats. For instance, the Glossina Morsitans subspecies inhabits savannahs while the Glossina Palpalis subspecies prefers woody riverine habitats. However, all flies are susceptible to extremes in temperature (outside of the 16-40 degree Celsius range). Furthermore, trypanosomes are only able to reproduce in tsetse flies between the 25 to 30 Celsius range. These factors mean that only a minority of tsetse flies, around 20 percent, are estimated to carry trypanosomes. These flies can also adapt to human activity, thus causing changes in disease patterns. For example, when brush is cleared for agriculture, the flies can retreat into the savannah and conversely when humans move into brush, the flies will reproduce and feed more frequently. As a result, large increases of population associated with expansion into woody habitats often coincides with trypanosomiasis epidemics.

Traditionally, cattle herders in East Africa were well aware of the effects of the tsetse flies and avoided these areas or set fire to the bush in order to clear the area of the flies and infected animals. The equilibrium was disturbed in the colonial era leading to multiple epidemics.

Humans, their livestock, or wild animals can all act as reservoirs of trypanosomiasis disease. However, the reservoirs used differ based on subspecies of trypanosoma protozoans and thus the variants of trypanosomiasis disease. There are two main variants of trypanosomoiasis which are in turn transmitted by different subspecies of the trypanosome protozoans. Trypanosoma brucei rhodiense tends to result in more acute forms of disease and is mainly transmitted form one human to another. Most patients with this variant of disease will die within six months of infection. Cattle can also act as a reservoir in areas where disease incidence is lower. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is the second type of protozoan which usually results in more chronic disease patterns. Its main reservoir is the cattle populations. Although it is also fatal, death can take months or years to occur. Geographical separation of these two variants of trypanosomes occurs along the Rift Valley. Trypanosoma brucei rhodiense is usually found on the eastern side of the valley while the gambiense variant resides on the western side. The ranges of the two disease variants could overlap in Uganda, Tanzania, and Congo in the future.  
==Research==
Trypanosomiasis could, in future be prevented by genetically altering the tsetse fly. As the tsetse fly is the main vector of transmission, making the fly immune to the disease by altering its genome could be the main component in an effort to eradicate the disease. New technologies such as CRISPR allowing cheaper and easier genetic engineering could allow for such measures. A pilot program in Senegal, funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency, has considerably reduced the tsetse fly population by introducing male flies which have been sterilized by exposure to gamma rays. This has allowed a change of cattle breeds from lower producing trypanotolerant breeds to higher-producing foreign breeds, and was selected as one of the Best Sustainable Development Practices on Food Security by EXPO Milan 2015.

<doc id="644501" wikidata="Q1616285" url="?curid=644501" title="Mount Jackson (Antarctica)">
<text>Mount Jackson (Mount Andrew Jackson and Mount Ernest Gruening) is a mountain that dominates the upland of the southern part of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is located in Palmer Land, part of the British Antarctic Territory (with unrecognised claims by Chile and Argentina). 
With an elevation of , Mount Jackson was once thought to be the highest mountain in the Antarctic Peninsula and the British Antarctic Territory, before the true height of Mount Hope (Eternity Range) was measured.
Discovered by members of the United States Antarctic Service, 1939–41, it was named for Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States. The first ascent of Mount Jackson was made by a team led by John Crabbe Cunningham of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1964. Mount Jackson&#x27;s geology was studied in 1972 as part of the Palmer Island investigations by a team of geologists.
==Topography==
Mount Jackson and the Welch Mountains demarcate the central Black Coast, which is dissected by many inlets and is bounded on the west by Dyer Plateau of central Palmer Land. The two mountains rise above the ice shelf with reliefs of about towards the east. They are interconnected by icefall zones forming a plateau with steep snow slopes. Mount Jackson rises from its southeast flanks, displaying a steeple summit, whilst the north flank is occupied by a vast cirque. Supraglacial moraines on the mountain&#x27;s east side measure between in length and display boulders at their distal ends.

==History==
The first topographic mapping of Mount Jackson was carried out in November 1940 by a sledge party of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS). The ground survey was facilitated by aerial photographs and aerial observations. 
The height was estimated at , and the mountain was named Mount Ernest Gruening after the Governor of the Alaska Territory at that time, Ernest Gruening.
USAS later renamed it Mount Jackson for the seventh President of the United States. 
President Jackson signed the bill into law authorizing the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–42. The expedition, led by Lt. Charles Wilkes, included exploration and surveying of the Pacific Ocean and surrounding lands, including Antarctica.

In November 1947, a Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey ground party based at Stonington Island observed Mount Jackson and estimated its height at , considerably lower and more accurate than the first estimate in 1940.
After the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey was renamed the British Antarctic Survey in 1962, a series of depots were developed, including one at Mount Jackson. BAS members were successful in making many first ascents of the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula, and John Cunningham, who served at the BAS base at Adelaide Island, was the first to climb Mount Jackson. Traveling by dog sled for , his team reached the summit on 23 November 1964.

A precise height of the summit was determined by a BAS survey party who ascended the peak during the austral summer of 1996–97.

==Geography==

The mountain is in height, with a prominence of and a saddle DEM of . Mount Jackson and the Welch Mountains demarcate the central Black Coast, which is dissected by many inlets and is bounded on the west by Dyer Plateau of central Palmer Land, with elevation ranging between , and on the west side of the central Black Coast. The two mountains rise above the ice shelf with reliefs of about towards the east. They are interconnected by icefall zones forming a plateau with steep snow slopes.
The northern part of the mountain system, which extends over , covers most of the Antarctic Peninsula, and Mount Jackson is its highest peak.

Mount Jackson rises from its southeast flanks, displaying a steeple summit, whilst the north flank is occupied by a vast cirque. Supraglacial moraines on the mountain&#x27;s east side measure between in length and display boulders at their distal ends. Mount Jackson and the Rowley Massif are separated by Odom Inlet. Cline Glacier drains eastern Mount Jackson before arriving at Odom Inlet.

Mount Jackson&#x27;s geology was studied in 1972 as part of the Palmer Island investigations by a team of geologists. They identified various rock types and underlying volcanic activity. The relief of the west facing slopes is gentler when compared to the eastern side, characterized by a steep rocky face. Rock weathering is intense in the area spread with scree and felsenmeer. Fresh rock formations and bedrock disintegration are noted.

==Nearby features==
Nnearby features include, from north to south, Mount Van Buren, Swarson Nunatak, Davis Ridge and Musson Nunatak.
===Mount Van Buren===
The prominent mountain north-northwest of Mount Jackson, at the east side of the Dyer Plateau. 
Mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1974.
The name was applied by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in association with Mount Jackson. 
Martin Van Buren (1782-1862) was the eighth President of the United States, 1837-41. 
He was Vice President, 1833-37, during the second term of President Andrew Jackson.

===Swarsen Nunatak===
A conspicuous nunatak, largely snow covered, located southwest of Mount Jackson. 
Mapped by the USGS in 1974.
Named by the US-ACAN for Lieutenant Commander Ronald J. Swarsen, United States Navy Reserve, Medical Officer at Byrd Station, 1971, and at the South Pole Station, 1973.

===Davis Ridge===
A ridge of irregular shape, apparently an outlier of the Mount Jackson massif. 
It rises above the ice surface east-southeast of the summit of Mount Jackson. 
Mapped by the USGS in 1974. 
Named by the US-ACAN for Brent L. Davis, USARP biologist at Palmer Station, 1971, and in the Antarctic Peninsula area, 1974-75 season.

===Musson Nunatak===
A pyramidal nunatak standing south of Mount Jackson, at the east margin of the Dyer Plateau. 
Mapped by the USGS in 1974. 
Named by the US-ACAN for John M. Musson, PH2, United States Navy, photographer and member of the cartographic aerial mapping crew in LC-130 aircraft of Squadron VXE-6, 1968-69.

<doc id="644504" wikidata="Q429258" url="?curid=644504" title="Background independence">
<text>Background independence is a condition in theoretical physics that requires the defining equations of a theory to be independent of the actual shape of the spacetime and the value of various fields within the spacetime. In particular this means that it must be possible not to refer to a specific coordinate system—the theory must be coordinate-free. In addition, the different spacetime configurations (or backgrounds) should be obtained as different solutions of the underlying equations.

==Description==
Background independence is a loosely defined property of a theory of physics. Roughly speaking, it limits the number of mathematical structures used to describe space and time that are put in place &quot;by hand&quot;. Instead, these structures are the result of dynamical equations, such as Einstein field equations, so that one can determine from first principles what form they should take. Since the form of the metric determines the result of calculations, a theory with background independence is more predictive than a theory without it, since the theory requires fewer inputs to make its predictions. This is analogous to desiring fewer free parameters in a fundamental theory.

So background independence can be seen as extending the mathematical objects that should be predicted from theory to include not just the parameters, but also geometrical structures. Summarizing this, Rickles writes: &quot;Background structures are contrasted with dynamical ones, and a background independent theory only possesses the latter type—obviously, background dependent theories are those possessing the former type in addition to the latter type.&quot;

In general relativity, background independence is identified with the property that the metric of spacetime is the solution of a dynamical equation. In classical mechanics, this is not the case, the metric is fixed by the physicist to match experimental observations. This is undesirable, since the form of the metric impacts the physical predictions, but is not itself predicted by the theory.

==Manifest background independence==
Manifest background independence is primarily an aesthetic rather than a physical requirement. It is analogous and closely related to requiring in differential geometry that equations be written in a form that is independent of the choice of charts and coordinate embeddings. If a background-independent formalism is present, it can lead to simpler and more elegant equations. However, there is no physical content in requiring that a theory be manifestly background-independent – for example, the equations of general relativity can be rewritten in local coordinates without affecting the physical implications.

Although making a property manifest is only aesthetic, it is a useful tool for making sure the theory actually has that property. For example, if a theory is written in a manifestly Lorentz-invariant way, one can check at every step to be sure that Lorentz invariance is preserved. Making a property manifest also makes it clear whether or not the theory actually has that property. The inability to make classical mechanics manifestly Lorentz-invariant does not reflect a lack of imagination on the part of the theorist, but rather a physical feature of the theory. The same goes for making classical mechanics or electromagnetism background-independent.

==Theories of quantum gravity==
Because of the speculative nature of quantum-gravity research, there is much debate as to the correct implementation of background independence. Ultimately, the answer is to be decided by experiment, but until experiments can probe quantum-gravity phenomena, physicists have to settle for debate. Below is a brief summary of the two largest quantum-gravity approaches.

Physicists have studied models of 3D quantum gravity, which is a much simpler problem than 4D quantum gravity (this is because in 3D, quantum gravity has no local degrees of freedom). In these models, there are non-zero transition amplitudes between two different topologies, or in other words, the topology changes. This and other similar results lead physicists to believe that any consistent quantum theory of gravity should include topology change as a dynamical process.

===String theory===
String theory is usually formulated with perturbation theory around a fixed background. While it is possible that the theory defined this way is locally background-invariant, if so, it is not manifest, and it is not clear what the exact meaning is. One attempt to formulate string theory in a manifestly background-independent fashion is string field theory, but little progress has been made in understanding it.

Another approach is the conjectured, but yet unproven AdS/CFT duality, which is believed to provide a full, non-perturbative definition of string theory in spacetimes with anti-de Sitter asymptotics. If so, this could describe a kind of superselection sector of the putative background-independent theory. But it would still be restricted to anti-de Sitter space asymptotics, which disagrees with the current observations of our Universe. A full non-perturbative definition of the theory in arbitrary spacetime backgrounds is still lacking.

Topology change is an established process in string theory.

===Loop quantum gravity===
A very different approach to quantum gravity called loop quantum gravity is fully non-perturbative and manifestly background-independent: geometric quantities, such as area, are predicted without reference to a background metric or asymptotics (e.g. no need for a background metric or anti-de Sitter asymptotics), only a given topology.

<doc id="644508" wikidata="Q453685" url="?curid=644508" title="Society for German–Soviet Friendship">
<text>The Society for German–Soviet Friendship (in German, &quot;Gesellschaft für Deutsch-Sowjetische Freundschaft/DSF&quot;) was an East German organization set up to encourage closer co-operation between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

It was founded from the Society for the Studies of Soviet Culture to teach about Russian culture to Germans unfamiliar with it. It quickly turned into a propaganda tool and eventually changed its name.

Due to the immense popularity of Mikhail Gorbachev with ordinary East Germans disillusioned with their own hardline Communist leaders, the DSF&#x27;s membership grew massively in the last years of the regime which many interpret as a sign of support of Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost and perestroika by the East German people. In 1989 there were 6.3 million members.

Following the disbanding of the German Democratic Republic, the organization was dissolved.

The name has inspired band names that play on the name of the DSF , for instance the German band Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, which means German-American Friendship, as well as Jewish Ukrainian Freundschaft (J.U.F.).

<doc id="644510" wikidata="Q887889" url="?curid=644510" title="Bob Dornan">
<text>Robert Kenneth Dornan (born April 3, 1933) is an American actor, radio talk show host, combat veteran, and Republican politician from California. Dornan represented two Southern California districts in the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1983 and from 1985 to 1997, where he became known as a &quot;leading firebrand&quot; on the party&#x27;s conservative wing. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 1982 and for President of the United States in 1996.

A former actor and television and radio talk show host, Dornan had a flair for the dramatic that drew supporters and detractors well beyond his congressional district. Though never a major power in Washington, he became one of the most well-known members of the House of Representatives as a participant in televised &quot;special orders&quot; speeches and was described as &quot;one of the leading firebrands among American politicians&quot;. He has become well known for publicly outing fellow Republican U.S. Representative Steve Gunderson as gay on the House of Representatives floor in 1994.

==Early life==
Dornan was born in New York City, the son of Gertrude (McFadden) Dornan (1900–1967) and Harry Joseph Dornan (1892–1975). In New York, Dornan&#x27;s mother had been a vaudeville performer as part of an act called the McFadden Sisters and a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl, and had performed under the stage name Bara Wilkes; her sister was the wife of actor Jack Haley. Harry Dornan owned a haberdashery. After moving to California, he became a real estate entrepreneur in West Los Angeles. He was active in harness racing, a pastime in which many celebrities participated during the 1940s and 1950s. Robert Dornan took advantage of his family&#x27;s entertainment industry experience and connections after he embarked on his own acting and talk show career. He used celebrity endorsements and campaign contributions to launch his political career.

Dornan attended Loyola University of Los Angeles (later renamed Loyola Marymount University) from 1950 to 1953. At age 19, Robert joined the United States Air Force. He became a fighter pilot, and during his time in the Air Force, he survived two emergency parachute ejections and two &quot;dead stick&quot; forced landings (including one of an F-100). He was on active duty until 1958, and attained the rank of captain. He served in the California Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve until retiring in 1975. Dornan also served as a combat journalist and photographer on several missions in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia during the Vietnam War and flew relief flights into Biafra.

== Career ==

=== Entertainment ===
Dornan was involved in the entertainment industry as an actor. He starred in the film &quot;The Starfighters&quot;, cast as Lt. Witkowski, an Air Force pilot who was the son of a U.S. congressman. &quot;The Starfighters&quot; aired on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; on October 29, 1994.

In 1962, he portrayed Air Force Lieutenant Alden in the episode &quot;Dennis at Boot Camp&quot; of the CBS sitcom, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, starring Jay North and Gale Gordon, with Roy Roberts in this segment as Captain Stone.

In 1966 he co-starred in and possibly co-wrote &quot;To the Shores of Hell&quot;.

Dornan had a frequent role as Captain Fowler on ABC&#x27;s &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; television series and smaller roles on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Bewitched&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. Dornan was an Emmy-award-winning television talk show host on &quot;Tempo&quot; and &quot;The Robert K. Dornan Show&quot; broadcast from Los Angeles from 1967 to 1973.

===Politics===
Dornan has said he took an active role in the civil rights movement. He did attend the historic 1963 March on Washington led by Martin Luther King Jr.; when this claim was questioned in 1994, he circulated a photo of himself in his Air Force uniform seated in the audience for King&#x27;s speech. News accounts also indicate he participated in voter registration drives for African Americans in Mississippi. However, a 1998 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article indicated there is no corroborating information (such as news clippings from the era) to confirm this claim.

Dornan moved into politics in 1973 as national spokesman for the Citizens for Decency Through Law advocacy group. He made an unsuccessful run for mayor of Los Angeles the same year. In 1976, Dornan was elected to the House of Representatives, representing the 27th congressional district in western Los Angeles County. He was re-elected twice. He was such an unswerving advocate for the development of the B-1 bomber, that he was soon nicknamed &quot;B-1 Bob&quot;.

In November 1977, he was an opposition speaker at the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference with Lottie Beth Hobbs, Dr. Mildred Jefferson, Phyllis Schlafly and Nellie Gray.

After the 1980 census, California&#x27;s congressional map was redrawn. Dornan&#x27;s district, previously a Republican-leaning swing district, was made significantly more Democratic. Believing he had no chance of winning this new district, he opted to run for the United States Senate in 1982. He finished fourth in the Republican primary behind San Diego mayor and future Governor Pete Wilson, who won in November.

Dornan moved to Garden Grove, in the more Republican Orange County. In 1984, he was elected to Congress from the 38th district in central Orange County, defeating 10-year Democratic incumbent Jerry M. Patterson by a 53% to 45% margin amid Ronald Reagan&#x27;s massive landslide that year. In 1986, he won a tough race against Democratic state Assemblyman Richard Robinson, winning by a 55% to 43% margin. He was re-elected four more times and served on the Intelligence Committee.

Dornan made headlines in March 1985 for a confrontation with Representative Thomas Downey (a Democrat from New York) on the House floor. Downey asked Dornan about comments he had made calling Downey &quot;a draft-dodging wimp&quot;. (Downey was exempt from the Vietnam War draft because of a perforated eardrum.) According to Downey, Dornan, grabbing him by collar and tie, said, &quot;It&#x27;s good you&#x27;re being protected by the sergeant-at-arms. If I saw you outside, it would be a different story&quot; and threatened him &quot;with some form of bodily harm&quot;. Dornan claimed he was merely straightening Downey&#x27;s tie and refused to apologize for the incident or the derogatory comment. A Dornan aide said, &quot;It will be a cold day in hell before he gets an apology from Bob Dornan&quot;.
Dornan&#x27;s record was staunchly conservative. However, he did hold some positions that some might call liberal, including sponsoring animal protection acts, earning him the recognition of PETA in 1988.

In 1994, during his final successful run for Congress, it was reported that Dornan&#x27;s wife, Sallie, had made multiple allegations of domestic violence against him earlier in their marriage. In 1966, Dornan had been convicted of a domestic violence offense and sentenced to jail time; however, it was unclear whether his sentence had ever been served. After the allegations were made public, Sallie Dornan retracted them, stating that she had made false claims about her husband during a period when she was struggling with prescription drug addiction. The Dornans&#x27; five children asserted that their father had not been physically abusive. During the same campaign, Dornan had signs posted at polling places that warned voters in Spanish that they should be prepared to prove their citizenship in order to vote. The signs suggested that immigration officials would be present at the polls. The success of this action was believed to have kept enough Latino voters away from the polls to eke out a victory for Dornan against Mike Farber.

In 1995, Dornan received a minor reprimand from the House for stating in a floor speech that President Bill Clinton had &quot;given aid and comfort to the enemy&quot; during the Vietnam War.

Dornan was a dark horse candidate for president of the United States in 1996. In a GOP debate in Iowa on January 13, Dornan called Clinton a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;pathological liar&quot;. Dornan later dropped out of the presidential race and ran for reelection to his seat in the House; he was defeated by Democrat Loretta Sanchez by less than 1,000 votes. 
Following the narrow defeat, Dornan alleged that Sanchez&#x27;s winning margin was provided by illegal voting from non-U.S. citizens. A thirteen-month House of Representatives investigation ensued, during which Sanchez was seated provisionally, pending the inquiry. A task force found 748 votes that had been cast illegally—624 from non-citizens in addition to 124 that had already been thrown out by California officials. This was not enough to overturn Sanchez&#x27;s margin of victory and she was allowed to keep her seat. However, in consultation with the INS, the House committee identified 4,762 questionable registration affidavits.

In September 1997, while his 1996 bid against Sanchez was still being contested, Dornan confronted then-Representative Bob Menendez on the House floor, using profanity and calling Menendez an &quot;anti-Catholic coward&quot;. This encounter led to Menendez filing a resolution to bar Dornan from the House floor until the election was resolved, which passed by a vote of 289–65.

====Controversial statements====
During his political career, Dornan became known for his controversial or offensive statements. Among his remarks:

*During a House debate in 1994, Dornan outed fellow Republican representative Steve Gunderson, accusing him of having a &quot;revolving door on his closet.&quot;
*In a 1986 U.S. House speech, he called Soviet journalist Vladimir Posner a &quot;disloyal, betraying little Jew who sits there on television claiming that he is somehow or other a newsman.&quot; This was the only statement Dornan apologized for, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s the only thing in my life I ever lost sleep over.&quot; Dornan also said that he intended &quot;to say &#x27;Judas&#x27;, not &#x27;Jew&#x27;,&quot; as a rebuttal to Posner&#x27;s insistence that the Soviet Union was free of anti-Semitism.
*&quot;Every lesbian spear chucker in this country is hoping I get defeated&quot; to a Los Angeles television reporter in 1992 regarding a female challenger in the primary election.
*On a January 28, 1994, appearance on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, Dornan declared it was &quot;The Year of the Penis&quot; due to recent events in the news. This was a joke in regard to the 1992 media and political reference as that election being referred to as &quot;The Year of the Woman&quot;, when four women won election to the United States Senate.
*&quot;You are a slimy coward. Go register in another party&quot; to Orange County Republican Central Committee member William Dougherty after he supported Dornan&#x27;s opponent in 1996.

In 1994, a 120-page book of quotations of Dornan was compiled by Nathan Callahan and William Payton and published as &quot;Shut Up, Fag!&quot; The quotation that gives the book the title was actually shouted by Dornan&#x27;s wife, Sallie, at an AIDS activist during an Orange County town forum. Dornan claimed the book was backed by director Oliver Stone, whom Dornan labeled &quot;a Bolshevik enemy&quot;.

Dornan&#x27;s comments and behavior led his political opponents to question his mental health. Mike Kaspar of the Orange County Democratic Party said, &quot;The primary issue is Bob Dornan, himself. I think his character and his own sanity are an issue here.&quot; At a White House Correspondents Dinner, Al Franken, who had worked once on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; with Dornan, joked &quot;having Al D&#x27;Amato leading an ethics investigation is like getting Bob Dornan to head up a mental health task force.&quot; Michael Moore devoted an entire chapter of his book &quot;Downsize This!&quot; to his efforts to get Dornan involuntarily committed for psychiatric examination.

===Later career===
Dornan ran against Loretta Sanchez again in 1998, but was defeated.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Dornan hosted &quot;The Bob Dornan Show&quot;, a radio talk show syndicated nationally by Talk Radio Network.

In 2004, Dornan challenged Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican, in the primary. Dornan charged Rohrabacher with being soft on terrorism and being too close to Islamic extremists. However, he lost by 84% to 16%.

During the summer of 2005, Dornan briefly expressed interest in the 48th congressional district seat that became vacant when then U.S. Congressman Christopher Cox resigned to become chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He was interested in running as the nominee of the American Independent Party but did not, allegedly rebuffed by party officials.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Dornan married Sallie Hansen. They have five children.

<text>Died Pretty, sometimes The Died Pretty, were an Australian alternative rock band founded by mainstays Ron Peno (lead singer) and Brett Myers (lead guitarist and backing vocalist) in Sydney in 1983. Their music started from a base of early electric Bob Dylan with psychedelic influences, including The Velvet Underground and Television. They were managed by John Needham, who is the owner of Citadel Records, their main label.

Died Pretty&#x27;s 1990s albums, &quot;Doughboy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Trace&quot; and &quot;Sold&quot;, appeared on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Charts but they had more success on the alternative scene. According to rock music historian Ian McFarlane they &quot;unashamedly plundered rock&#x27;s past to arrive at an original sound that was always passionate, atmospheric and uplifting ... produced some of the most inspirational rock music heard in Australia&quot;. The group formally disbanded in 2002 but the members reunited on a number of occasions for short tours in Australia. They undertook a joint national tour with Radio Birdman in June and July 2017.

==History==
===1983–1989: Formation and early years===
Died Pretty was formed in 1983 in Sydney. Peno had been a member of Sydney punk band The Hellcats (as Ronnie Pop, 1977), and followed with The 31st (in Brisbane, 1979–1981) and Screaming Tribesmen (Brisbane then Sydney, 1981–1983). In April 1983, music journalist and keyboardist Frank Brunetti of Super K had formed a duo with lead guitarist and vocalist Brett Myers from The End (in Brisbane then Sydney). Myers was a fan of American group Velvet Underground and the duo modelled themselves after experimental New York protopunk band Suicide. Brunetti suggested Peno join as singer and their first five performances were in Brisbane under the name Final Solution, after the song by Pere Ubu. Peno provided the name Died Pretty, and on drums, they recruited Rob Younger (Radio Birdman, Super K) for two months. After various bass guitarists, Jonathan Lickliter joined and Younger was replaced by Colin Barwick both from The End with Myers. Younger concentrated on his career as producer for Citadel Records. Died Pretty signed with Citadel and were managed by the label&#x27;s owner John Needham. Their music started from a base of early electric Bob Dylan with psychedelic influences, including The Velvet Underground and Television. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, they &quot;unashamedly plundered rock&#x27;s past to arrive at an original sound that was always passionate, atmospheric and uplifting ... produced some of the most inspirational rock music heard in Australia&quot;.

The band came to the attention of the Australian independent music scene and inner city circuit. In January 1984 they recorded &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, with Younger producing, which was released on Citadel as their first single. Before touring to Melbourne, Lickliter was replaced on bass guitar by Mark Lock (The Phantom Agents, End). In August they recorded a 10-minute psychedelic epic &quot;Mirror Blues&quot; (issued split over a 7&quot; in Australia and intact on 12&quot; in the United Kingdom). Barwick was dissatisfied with Died Pretty and the band tried to recruit Chris Welsh (The 31st, Screaming Tribesmen) but initially could not finance a drum kit for him. With Welsh finally on board, they recorded the extended play (EP), &quot;Next to Nothing&quot;, released in August 1985. It held a top ten position on the alternative charts for nearly 12 months, starting their career with critical attention and three alternative chart No. 1 hits in a row. UK label, What Goes On, compiled their early singles as &quot;The Died Pretty&quot; on a three-track EP and French label Closer released &quot;Next to Nothing&quot; in 1985. Three releases achieved &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; in UK music weekly &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, though the band did not achieve a great deal of popularity or notice by the UK public. The next single &quot;Stoneage Cinderella&quot; was released in June 1986, taken from their first album &quot;Free Dirt&quot;, produced by Younger, which followed in August. &quot;Free Dirt&quot; was released internationally by What Goes On and Citadel. The band went on its first tour to Europe and the United States in October, which included two weeks in France with drummer Andrew Edge filling-in for Welsh, who had broken his foot in London. Died Pretty became a popular attraction in France and Italy.

The second album, &quot;Lost&quot;, was released in June 1988 on the Blue Mosque label, an offshoot of Citadel and major label Festival Records, and outside Australia through Beggars Banquet and Closer. It was the second highest selling alternative album for the year and peaked at No. 3 in Italy. Myers produced two albums for Citadel label mates Porcelain Bus. Lock departed after recording &quot;Lost&quot; but before its release – he had grown weary of touring – and was replaced on bass guitar by Steve Clark (The Glass, 30/40 Purple). Died Pretty undertook their second tour of US and Europe. &quot;Lost&quot; provided three singles – &quot;Winterland&quot;, &quot;Towers of Strength&quot; and &quot;Out of My Hands&quot;. Brunetti had left in April 1988 – his last recording, &quot;Everybody Moves&quot;, was released as a single in 1989 – and was replaced by John Hoey, (Thought Criminals, X-Men, New Christs) on keyboards. The band went on a third tour of Europe and US, but remained in Los Angeles at tour&#x27;s end to prepare for their next album.

===1990–2002: Second phase===
Died Pretty recorded their third album, &quot;Every Brilliant Eye&quot;, in Los Angeles with Jeff Eyrich (The Gun Club, The Plimsouls) producing. It was released on Blue Mosque in April 1990. The album featured a more polished production with leaner, more rock-oriented songs – it spawned the singles, &quot;Whitlam Square&quot; (February), &quot;True Fools Fall&quot; (May) and &quot;Is There Anyone?&quot;.

Their fourth album, &quot;Doughboy Hollow&quot;, was released in August 1991 on Blue Mosque and Beggars Banquet, which peaked at No. 24 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. The album was &quot;[b]rimming with passionate, dramatic and alluring musical vistas&quot;. It was produced by Englishman Hugh Jones (The Damned, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Simple Minds). Its singles, &quot;Stop Myself&quot;, &quot;D.C.&quot; and &quot;Sweetheart&quot;, despite being &quot;near-perfect pop&quot;, did not achieve mainstream chart success. After recording the album, Brisbane bass guitarist Robert Warren replaced Clark. The band were nominated for two ARIA Awards in 1992. Welsh was replaced by a succession of drummers, Murray Shepherd (Screaming Tribesmen), Warwick Fraser (Screaming Tribesmen) and Stuart Eadie (Clouds) before he returned at year&#x27;s end.

Reuniting with producer Hugh Jones, their next album, &quot;Trace&quot; was released worldwide by Sony Music in September 1993, and became their biggest-selling album to date, peaking at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It spun off four singles and videos, &quot;Caressing Swine&quot;, &quot;Harness Up&quot;, &quot;Headaround&quot; and &quot;A State of Graceful Mourning&#x27;. The video for &quot;A State of Graceful Mourning&quot; was filmed in a forest that had been burned out by the 1994 Eastern seaboard fires. Soon after the release of &quot;Trace&quot;, long-time drummer Welsh left and became an English teacher in Thailand. A CD-EP, &quot;Days&quot; was issued late in 1994 with Nick Kennedy (Big Heavy Stuff) on drums. They supported R.E.M., at that band&#x27;s request, on the Australian leg of their Monster Tour, in early 1995.

Their next album, &quot;Sold&quot;, released in February 1996, was recorded with contributions by two drummers - Kennedy had been replaced by Shane Melder (on loan from Sidewinder). &quot;Sold&quot; reunited them with original producer Younger, who co-produced with Wayne Connolly. It was also mixed at the well-known Fort Apache Studios in Boston by Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade (Buffalo Tom, Radiohead, Dinosaur Jr). A rougher, harder-sounding collection than &quot;Doughboy&quot; or &quot;Trace&quot;, it gained critical acclaim and reached the Top 30. Its singles &quot;Cuttin&#x27; Up Her Legs&quot; and &quot;Good at Love&quot; failed to chart and Died Pretty were dropped by Sony in April 1996. Simon Cox (Juice) joined on as full-time drummer in May and the group signed back with Citadel, and released a four-track EP, &quot;Deeper&quot; in November. The EP has a guest appearance by Hoodoo Gurus guitarist Brad Shepherd and has Peno playing harmonica on the opening track &quot;You Need Wings&quot;. The EP was produced by Connolly, who had become the band&#x27;s producer of choice and would work on all their subsequent studio output.

Their last two studio albums, &quot;Using My Gills As a Roadmap&quot; (1998) and &quot;Everydaydream&quot; (2000) showed the band moving away from basic guitar rock and making greater use of electronics, citing Kraftwerk, David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; and obscure Euro dance records as influences. They released a compilation, &quot;Out of the Unknown – The Best of Died Pretty&quot; (1999), on Citadel.

Bass guitarist Warren departed the band temporarily in December 2001 due to tinnitus. Myers and Peno – the band&#x27;s main songwriters – began working on a proposed new album, but this proved difficult as Peno had moved to Melbourne. In May 2002, Died Pretty announced they would disband after a final Australian tour with Warren back on board. They released a three-track &#x27;farewell&#x27; single, &quot;My Generation Landslide&quot; in August.

===2002–2023: Later projects and reformations===
Peno joined with guitarist and vocalist Kim Salmon (The Scientists, Beasts of Bourbon) in 2005 to form country music group, Darling Downs. They recorded two albums, &quot;How Can I Forget This Heart of Mine?&quot; (2005) and &quot;From One to Another&quot; (2007). In 2007, Peno and Myers recorded an independently released album as Noises and Other Voices. It included material originally written for Died Pretty&#x27;s unrecorded final album, along with some newly written songs. Peno and Myers played occasional &#x27;Songs of Died Pretty Unplugged&#x27; shows in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, including the Queenscliff music festival.

In February 2008, Died Pretty re-formed to perform &quot;Doughboy Hollow&quot; in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series, using that album&#x27;s line-up – Clark, Hoey, Myers, Peno and Welsh – playing together for the first time in sixteen years. Peno revealed that a documentary was pending – featuring interviews with band members, and rehearsal and concert footage from the Melbourne shows. &quot;Doughboy Hollow&quot; was remastered, expanded and reissued by Citadel Records in February. The tour included shows in all major capital cities. The line-up continued with appearances at the 2008 Homebake Festival in Sydney and EG Awards Hall of Fame inductees on 4 December in Melbourne. They appeared on the nationwide Big Day Out tour in January 2009, having played the inaugural Big Day Out back in 1992. A 2×CD deluxe reissue of their debut album &quot;Free Dirt&quot; was released through Aztec Music in late 2008, and an expanded reissue of 1988&#x27;s &quot;Lost&quot; was released in June 2013. Peno &amp; Myers performed an acoustic set at the Orient Hotel, Brisbane, on 7 November 2009 for a private party. Peno had returned to his solo career by May 2010. In October 2010, &quot;Doughboy Hollow&quot; (1991) was listed in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

In April 2012, Died Pretty performed as part of the Dig It Up! series of concerts around Australia, organised to celebrate 30 years of recorded music by fellow Australian band Hoodoo Gurus.

In March 2016, the band played across Australia as part of the &#x27;A Day on the Green&#x27; concert series, with Hoodoo Gurus, Sunnyboys, Violent Femmes and Ratcat. They also played some headline shows in clubs.

The band undertook a joint national tour with Radio Birdman in June and July 2017.

On 14 February 2019, it was announced that Ron Peno had been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer and that all upcoming Died Pretty shows would be cancelled while he underwent immediate treatment. A further message on the band&#x27;s Instagram page stated that he &quot;stands strong to beat it.&quot;

In August 2019, Peno successfully completed chemotherapy, and the tumour in his oesophagus was surgically removed. Medical staff are confident that all the cancer has been removed from his body. In December, Died Pretty announced Australian concerts for April and May 2020.

The band officially returned to the stage with a performance at the Factory Theatre in Sydney on 17 April 2021.

The band released a double live album, simply titled &quot;Live&quot;, on 24 March 2023. The album was recorded during a show at Melbourne&#x27;s Forum Theatre in 2008, when the band reformed to play a series of gigs across Australia to celebrate &quot;Doughboy Hollow&quot; as part of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; concert series.

The band had intended to return to the stage for a live tour in October 2023; this was cancelled in July, however, due to both Peno and Welsh battling different forms of cancer. Peno died on 10 August 2023, at the age of 68.

<text>Neogastropoda is an order of aquatic snails, both freshwater and marine gastropod molluscs.

== Description ==

The available fossil record of Neogastropoda is relatively complete, and supports a widely accepted evolutionary scenario of an Early Cretaceous origin of the group followed by two rapid diversification rounds in the late Cretaceous and the Paleocene.

These sea snails have only one auricle, one kidney and one monopectinate gill, i.e. the gill filaments develop on only one side of the central axis.

The shell has a well-developed siphonal canal. The elongated trunk-like siphon is an extensible tube, formed from a fold in the mantle. It is used to suck water into the mantle cavity. At the base of the siphon is the bipectinate (branching from a central axis) osphradium, a sensory receptacle and olfactory organ, that is more developed than the one in the Mesogastropoda. They achieved important morphological changes including e.g., the elongation of the siphonal canal, a shift in the mouth opening to a terminal position on the head, and the formation of a well-developed proboscis.

The nervous system is very concentrated. Many species have the ganglia in a compact space.

The rachiglossate (rasp-like) radula, a layer of serially arranged teeth within the mouth, has only three denticles (small teeth) in each transverse row.

The Neogastropoda have separate sexes.

There are about 16,000 species. Neogastropoda includes many well-known gastropods including the cone snails, conchs, mud snails, olive snails, oyster drills, tulip shells, and whelks. The Neogastropoda all live in the sea, except &quot;Clea&quot;, and &quot;Rivomarginella&quot; that are freshwater genera. The neogastropods are most diverse in tropical seas. They are mostly predators, but some are saprophagous (scavengers).

== Taxonomy ==
According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005) the clade Neogastropoda consists of these superfamilies:
* Buccinoidea 
* Conoidea 
* Cancellarioidea : since 2017 treated as the superfamily Volutoidea 
* Mitroidea : added in 2017 
* Muricoidea 
* Olivoidea 
* Pseudolivoidea : since 2017 treated as a synonym of the superfamily Olivoidea 
* Turbinelloidea 
* Volutoidea 

When Neogastropoda was an order, it was placed within the prosobranch gastropods according to the taxonomy developed by Thiele (1921). The families which used to form the order Neogastropoda are now included in the clade Neogastropoda Cox, 1960.

Ever since Thiele (1929), Neogastropoda have been considered a natural group, clearly differentiated from other Caenogastropoda. The monophyly of the group is widely accepted among morphologists, and it is based on several synapomorphies mostly related with the anatomy of the digestive system. Current classifications of Neogastropoda generally recognize up to six superfamilies: Buccinoidea, Muricoidea, Olivoidea, Pseudolivoidea, Conoidea, and Cancellarioidea. Phylogenetic relationships among neogastropod superfamilies based on morphological characters are rather unstable, and for instance, Cancellarioidea or Buccinoidea have been alternatively proposed as the sister group of the remaining Neogastropoda.

==Families==

<text>Alexander Kluge (born 14 February 1932) is a German author, philosopher, academic and film director.

==Early life, education and early career==
Kluge was born in Halberstadt, Province of Saxony (now Saxony-Anhalt), Germany.

After growing up during World War II, he studied history, law and music at the University of Marburg Germany, and the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. He received his doctorate in law in 1956.

While studying in Frankfurt, Kluge befriended the philosopher Theodor W. Adorno, who was teaching at the Institute for Social Research, or Frankfurt School. Kluge served as a legal counsel for the Institute, and began writing his earliest stories during this period. At Adorno&#x27;s suggestion, he also began to investigate filmmaking, and in 1958, Adorno introduced him to German filmmaker Fritz Lang, for whom Kluge worked as an assistant on the making of &quot;The Tiger of Eschnapur&quot;.

==Cinematic works==
Kluge directed his first film in 1960, &quot;Brutality in Stone&quot;, a twelve-minute, black and white, lyrical montage work which, against the German commercial (&quot;Papa&#x27;s Kino&quot;) cinematic amnesia of the prior decade, inaugurated an exploration of the Nazi past. The film premièred in 1961 at what would become the showcase for the new generation of German filmmakers, the Westdeutsche Kurzfilmtage (now known as the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen) in Oberhausen, Germany.

Kluge was one of twenty-six signatories to the Oberhausen Manifesto of 1962, which marked the launch of the New German Cinema. That same year, with filmmakers Edgar Reitz and Detlev Schleiermacher, Kluge established the Ulm Institut für Filmgestaltung at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm, to promote the critical and aesthetic practices of Young German Film and the New German Cinema.

In 1965 he was a member of the jury at the 15th Berlin International Film Festival.

He went on to direct a number of films which have an inherent critique of commercial cinema and television through the creation of a &quot;counter-public sphere&quot; and their deployment of experimental forms, including montage. They include &quot;Abschied von Gestern&quot; (&quot;Yesterday Girl&quot;) (1966), an adaptation of Kluge&#x27;s story &quot;Anita G.&quot;; &quot;Die Artisten in der Zirkuskuppel: Ratlos&quot; (&quot;Artists under the Big Top: Perplexed&quot;) (1968); and &quot;The Assault of the Present on the Rest of Time&quot; (1985).

In 2017, Kluge and his studio are featured in the film &quot;Finite and Infinite Games&quot; by artist Sarah Morris. The film, which focuses around the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany, includes debate between Kluge and Morris on architecture, music, and the religious philosophy of American academic James P. Carse.

In 2025, his debut feature film &quot;Primitive Diversity&quot; was featured in the Harbour section of the 54th International Film Festival Rotterdam to be screened in February 2025.

== Television work ==

In 1987, Kluge founded the television production company Development Company for Television Program mbH (DCTP), which produces late-night and night-time independent television slots on the private channels RTL Television, Sat.1, and VOX.

Much of the DCTP programs consist of television documentaries by Kluge (often characterized by the lack of spoken narration and a heavy reliance upon text as well as graphical montages and image editing) as well as many interviews Kluge leads with various international personalities from the fields of arts, entertainment, science, philosophy, and politics. Some of the interviewed are fictitious characters portrayed by professional actors Helge Schneider and Peter Berling, or factual people parodied by the two, including, but not limited to, Adolf Hitler, historical Roman generals, Napoleon&#x27;s political advisors, or the lawyer of Michael Jackson.

Beside Kluge&#x27;s own productions, DCTP also co-produces so-called &quot;Magazinsendungen&quot;, which are investigatory programs in cooperation with Der Spiegel (&quot;SPIEGEL TV&quot;), Stern (&quot;&quot;), Süddeutsche Zeitung (&quot;Süddeutsche TV&quot;), Neue Zürcher Zeitung (&quot;NZZ Format&quot;), and the British Broadcasting Corporation.

==Literary works==
Kluge is also one of the major German fiction writers of the late-20th century and an important social critic. His fictional works, which tend toward the short story form, are significant for their formal experimentation and insistently critical thematics. Constituting a form of analytical fiction, they utilize techniques of narrative disruption, mixed genres, interpolation of non-literary texts and documents, and perspectival shifts. The texts frequently employ a flat, ironic tone. One frequent effect approximates what Viktor Shklovsky and the Russian formalists identified as defamiliarization or &quot;ostranenie&quot;. In an interview with &quot;032c&quot; magazine, Kluge described his point of view on writing with a quote by Georg Büchner: &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to see what my head looks like from above.&quot; Kluge explains that when &quot;writing literary texts, you look—if you&#x27;re going about it correctly—down to yourself, to your head from above. Then you no longer have a relationship with yourself. At the most, you have trust in yourself that a text will emerge from this and that you still have the sovereignty and the strength to throw it away if it amounts to nothing.&quot; Kluge has used several of his stories as the basis for his films.

Kluge&#x27;s major works of social criticism include &quot;Öffentlichkeit und Erfahrung. Zur Organisationsanalyse von bürgerlicher und proletarischer Öffentlichkeit&quot;, co-written with Oskar Negt and originally published in 1972, and &quot;Geschichte und Eigensinn&quot;, also co-authored with Negt. &quot;Öffentlichkeit und Erfahrung&quot; has been translated into English as &quot;Public Sphere and Experience: Toward an Analysis of the Bourgeois and Proletarian Public Sphere&quot; and &quot;Geschichte und Eigensinn&quot; was translated into English as &quot;History and Obstinacy,&quot; published in 2014 by Zone Books.

&quot;Public Sphere and Experience&quot; revisits and expands Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s notion of the public sphere (which he articulated in his book &quot;Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere&quot;) and calls for the development of a new &quot;proletarian public sphere&quot; grounded in the life experience of the working class. &quot;Geschichte und Eigensinn&quot; continues this project and tries to rethink the very nature of proletarian experience and develops a theory of &quot;living labour&quot; grounded in the work of Karl Marx.

He has also published numerous texts on literary, film and television criticism. In discussing his literary technique of blending fiction and reality with author Gary Indiana, Kluge also offers a critique of the media industry&#x27;s presentation of &quot;reality&quot;, which he asserts is intrinsically false:
 ...Human beings are not interested in reality. They can&#x27;t be; it&#x27;s the human essence. They have wishes. These wishes are strictly opposed to any ugly form of reality. They prefer to lie than to become divorced from their wishes...[they] forget everything and can give up everything except this principle of misunderstanding reality, the subjective... If this is real, then the media industry is realistic in telling fiction, and the construction of reality founded on this basis can only lie. This is one of the reasons why history isn&#x27;t realistic: it&#x27;s not documentary, it&#x27;s not genuine, and it&#x27;s not necessary.

&quot;Learning Processes with a Deadly Outcome&quot; (1973) is one of Kluge&#x27;s original contributions to the science-fiction genre.

In 2000, he published &quot;Chronik der Gefühle&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of Feelings&quot;), which critic Matthew D. Miller describes as a &quot;modern epic&quot;.

Since 2016 Kluge has been collaborating with the American writer Ben Lerner. Their collaborations are collected in &quot;The Snows of Venice,&quot; published in 2018 by Spector Books.

==Personal life==
His sister, Alexandra Kluge, was a film actress.

==Awards and honors==
His awards include the Italian Literature Prize Isola d&#x27;Elba (1967), and almost every major German-language literary prize, including the Heinrich von Kleist Prize (1985), the Heinrich-Böll-Preis (1993) and the Schiller Memorial Prize (2001). Kluge received the Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award for TV Journalism (2001). He has also received the Georg Büchner Prize (2003), Germany&#x27;s highest literary award. In recent years Kluge received the triennial Theodor W. Adorno Award of 2009. In 2010 Kluge received the Grimme Award, one of the most important German television awards, in the category &quot;Special mention&quot; in honour of his lifetime achievements.

<text>The &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class cruiser was a class of nine light cruisers built for the United States Navy between 1935 and 1938. Armed with five triple gun turrets (three forward, two aft), they mounted more main battery guns than any other standard US cruiser. The &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class ships were all commissioned between 1937 and 1939, in the time between the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War and before the invasion of Poland. They served extensively in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters during World War II.

 was sunk in the Pacific, and while some of the others were heavily damaged, the remaining ships of the class were decommissioned shortly after the end of the war. Six were transferred to South American navies in 1951, where they served for many more years. One of these, , formerly , was sunk during the Falklands War in 1982.

The &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class ships had a strong influence on US cruiser design. Nearly all subsequent US cruisers, heavy and light, were directly or indirectly based on them. Notable among these are the and of World War II.

== Design ==
The &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class design was a further refinement of the heavy cruiser that preceded it. The desire for the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s arose from the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which limited the construction of heavy cruisers, i.e., ships carrying guns with calibers between . Great Britain needed trade control cruisers and hoped that the treaty would limit nations to smaller cruisers with a range that she could afford. Agreement to the London Treaty and the proceeding with the American light cruiser design can be focused to Admiral William V. Pratt, who overrode the vehement objections of the General Board.

Under the treaty the US was allowed for 18 heavy cruisers and , with no limit on the number of ships, for light cruisers. The United States needed large cruisers to deal with the extreme ranges that operations in the Pacific Ocean required. Cruisers with guns and were therefore desired. The US Navy&#x27;s experience with the was not all that could be hoped for. Their light hull design caused a stressed hull and was very overweight. 

Design started in 1930, with the first four of the class ordered in 1933, and an additional three ships in 1934. Basic criteria had been that speed and range should match heavy cruisers, and when the Japanese carrying fifteen 6-inch main guns appeared, the new US ships would match their weaponry. Various combinations of armor and power plants were tried in the efforts to stay below the Treaty 10,000 ton limit. Aviation facilities were moved to the stern of the ship from the amidships position of the &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers.

From 1942, the bridge structure was lowered and radar was fitted.

===&quot;St. Louis&quot; subclass===
The last two ships of the class, and , were slightly modified versions of the design with new higher pressure boilers and a unit system of machinery that alternated boiler and engine rooms to prevent a ship from being immobilized by a single unlucky hit; this system would be used in all subsequent US cruisers. Additionally, AA armament was improved. They were the first US cruisers to be armed with twin 5-inch (127 mm)/38-caliber guns. They could be distinguished visually from the other &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s by the placement of the after deckhouse, immediately abaft the second funnel, and by the twin 5-inch mounts.

=== Armament ===

The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; class was equipped with 15 6-inch/47 caliber Mark 16 naval guns, developed from the 6-inch/53 caliber Mark 8 used on the &quot;Omaha&quot;-class cruiser. The decision was reached as the gun could achieve up to ten rounds per minute rate of fire. This gave the class the ability to send up to 150 rounds a minute at its intended target. This allowed the cruiser to smother an enemy ship with fire. The turret arrangement was five turrets, each mounting three guns on a single sleeve, which did not allow the guns in a turret to move independently. The 6-inch guns were of a new design, the Mark 16, which could fire a armor-piercing shell (AP) up to with twice the penetrative power of the old gun. The ammunition was of the semi-fixed type. The impact of the shell changed the General Board&#x27;s view on the usefulness of light cruisers in service.

As designed, the anti-aircraft weaponry specified eight /25 caliber guns and eight caliber M2 Browning machine guns. The intention to mount /75 caliber anti-aircraft guns was frustrated and the requirement was not fully met until 1943. The weapon as deployed was less than satisfactory with frequent jamming and weight being serious issues. Some of the class had 5-in/38 caliber guns installed versus the 5-in/25 guns. There were varied mixes of Oerlikon cannons and Bofors gun mountings actually installed during World War II, 28 40 mm (4 × 4, 6 × 2) and twenty 20 mm (10 × 2) being the most common.

=== Fire control ===

The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; class was deployed with the Mark 34 director and later the Mark 3 radar. This would be upgraded to the Mark 8 and again to the Mark 13 radar. The secondary battery was controlled by the Mark 28 and upgraded to the Mark 33 fire control systems. The associated radars were the Mark 4 fire control radar and upgraded again to the Mark 12. Two anti-aircraft fire directors were fitted to each ship. A late World War II refit saw the Mk 51 director installed for the Bofors guns. Night engagements were improved when in 1945, the Mark 57 and 63 directors were installed.

== Successors ==
The vast majority of cruisers built by the United States during World War II derive from the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; design. Modifications of the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class hull were the predecessors to the two main lines of wartime cruisers, respectively the light cruiser armed with 6-inch guns and heavy cruiser armed with 8-inch guns. The third line, the light cruiser armed with 5-inch guns, shared the same unit system of machinery arrangement as the other two lines, but on a smaller hull with two shafts instead of four.

The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; class would lead to the &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruiser (less a fifth triple 6-inch turret), which then led to the and finally the . The other successor was , built on a modified &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class hull, with a heavy cruiser armament featuring three rather than five triple turrets, but each turret containing larger 8-inch guns, and increased armor. &quot;Wichita&quot; was succeeded by the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class and the later class, and finally the upgraded . The &quot;Atlanta&quot; class would be succeeded by the and then almost by the cancelled . As the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class began building about a year after the &quot;Cleveland&quot; class, later &quot;Cleveland&quot; developments and improvements were incorporated into the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class hull.

Finally, both &quot;Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Baltimore&quot; hulls were converted to light aircraft carriers. The of light aircraft carriers, were converted from &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class cruisers under construction, and the light carriers used the basic form of the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruiser design.

==Ships in class==
== Service history ==
=== War service ===
Several &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s were seriously damaged during World War II, although all but one of the cruisers survived. was severely damaged by a shell that hit her forward turret magazine during the Battle of Cape Esperance on 11 October 1942, suffering many casualties, but the magazine (being partially flooded as a result of shell hits in her hull) did not explode. was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 13 December 1944, off Mindoro, which killed or wounded 310 crewmen. was torpedoed at the Battle of Kolombangara on 12–13 July 1943, as was her near-sister . After being repaired in the United States, &quot;Honolulu&quot; returned to service only to be torpedoed by a Japanese aircraft on 20 October 1944, during the invasion of Leyte. On 11 September 1943, was hit by a German Fritz X radio guided bomb which penetrated her #3 turret and blew out the bottom of the ship. Skillful damage control by her crew saved her from sinking. While under repair in the United States, &quot;Savannah&quot; and &quot;Honolulu&quot; were rebuilt with a bulged hull that increased their beam by nearly and their 5-inch/25 caliber guns were replaced by four twin 5-inch/38 caliber guns, although the repairs to &quot;Savannah&quot; were completed too late for her to see frontline action again.

&quot;Helena&quot; was sunk in 1943 during the Battle of Kula Gulf. The remains of the ship were discovered below the surface of New Georgia Sound by Paul Allen&#x27;s research ship in April 2018. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was seriously damaged twice, but survived the war.

=== Post-war ===
All ships of the class went into reserve in 1946-47. Six were sold to South American countries in the early 1950s, and served for many more years: &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot; to Chile, &quot;St. Louis&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia&quot; to Brazil, and &quot;Boise&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; to Argentina. &quot;Savannah&quot; and &quot;Honolulu&quot; remained in reserve until struck in 1959. (ex-&quot;Phoenix&quot;) was torpedoed and sunk by during the Falklands War, while (ex-&quot;Brooklyn&quot;) remained in service with the Chilean Navy until 1992. She sank under tow, on her way to the scrappers, in the mid-Pacific in 1992.

<text>Crown Point (also known historically as Thor&#x27;s Heights or Thor&#x27;s Crown) is a basalt promontory on the Columbia River Gorge and an associated state park in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is located in eastern Multnomah County, approximately east of Portland. Crown Point is one of the scenic lookouts along the Historic Columbia River Highway, providing a panoramic view of part of the Columbia River. It stands above the river and is the remains of a lava flow that filled the ancestral channel of the Columbia River 14 to 17 million years ago. The Point was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1971.

==Vista House==

The 1918 Art Nouveau style Vista House is an observatory at Crown Point that also serves as a memorial to Oregon pioneers and as a comfort station for travelers on the Historic Columbia River Highway. The site, on a rocky promontory, is above the Columbia River on the south side of the Columbia River Gorge. The building shows great sensitivity to its site in the Columbia River Gorge near Corbett, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.


==Crown Point Viaduct==
The Crown Point Viaduct, built in 1914, is a viaduct consisting of an elevated sidewalk supported by columns and a retaining wall which encircle the tight loop of roadway around Vista House (1918). The viaduct is a contributing structure in the National Historic Landmarked and National Register of Historic Places-listed Historic Columbia River Highway. Per the 2000 NHL nomination of the highway:This spiral viaduct was constructed of reinforced concrete and runs for 225 degrees of a circle around Crown Point. It functions as a sidewalk and curb with a parapet wall on the outside of a roadway cut into the rock formation. A dry masonry retaining wall stabilizes the hillside above and below the viaduct and masonry parapet walls that ring Vista House.

<doc id="644524" wikidata="Q158641" url="?curid=644524" title="Avantasia">
<text>Avantasia is a German supergroup metal opera project created by Tobias Sammet, vocalist of the band Edguy. It has been characterized as a rock opera, as it features the contributions of various vocalists and musicians and it consists of concept albums. The name is a blend of the words &quot;Avalon&quot; and &quot;fantasia&quot; (&#x27;fantasy&#x27;) and describes &quot;a world beyond human imagination&quot; (a quotation from the booklet of the debut album).

Conceived in 1999 as studio-only, two-album project, Avantasia has since released seven other studio albums and has toured the world multiple times. It can be divided into four periods of activity. The first, 1999–2002, saw the release of a self-titled single and the full-length albums &quot;The Metal Opera&quot; and &quot;The Metal Opera Part II&quot;. The second, 2006–2011, consists of the EPs &quot;Lost in Space Part 1 &amp; 2&quot; and The Wicked Trilogy, composed of the albums &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, &quot;The Wicked Symphony&quot; and &quot;Angel of Babylon&quot;. The third, 2013–2016, includes the albums &quot;The Mystery of Time&quot; and &quot;Ghostlights&quot;. The fourth period, 2019–2022, comprises the albums &quot;Moonglow&quot; and &quot;A Paranormal Evening with the Moonflower Society&quot;.

Some of the guest vocalists and musicians that have been featured on Avantasia are Michael Kiske, Jørn Lande, Alice Cooper, Klaus Meine, Dee Snider, Hansi Kürsch, Jon Oliva, Biff Byford, Joe Lynn Turner, Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, Geoff Tate, Kai Hansen, Rudolf Schenker, Bruce Kulick, Sascha Paeth, Eric Singer, Bob Catley, Roy Khan, Russell Allen, Timo Tolkki, Rob Rock, David DeFeis, Andre Matos, Sharon den Adel, Floor Jansen, Ralf Scheepers, Marko Hietala, Arjen Anthony Lucassen, Henjo Richter, Markus Grosskopf, Jens Johansson, Eric Martin, Ronnie Atkins, Oliver Hartmann, Mille Petrozza, Candice Night and Amanda Somerville.

==History==
===The Metal Operas (1999–2002)===
In Spring 1999, during Edguy&#x27;s &#x27;Theater of Salvation&#x27; tour, Tobias Sammet began to outline his ideas for a metal opera concept album featuring a number of guest musicians. When the tour finished, he began collaborating with metal vocalists like Michael Kiske, Andre Matos, Kai Hansen, Rob Rock, David Defeis, Sharon den Adel, Bob Catley and Oliver Hartmann to record the project. At this stage the core band consisted of four members, Sammet on keyboards, Henjo Richter on guitar, Markus Grosskopf on bass and Alex Holzwarth on drums. In 2001, a self-titled single and the first full-length album, &quot;The Metal Opera&quot;, were released. The project went on hiatus after the release of &quot;The Metal Opera Part II&quot; in September 2002.

===The Wicked Trilogy (2006–2011)===
At the end of 2006, Sammet confirmed the rumours of a third Avantasia album, due for release in 2008. Two EPs named &quot;Lost in Space Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; were released on 19 November 2007, while the full-length album, &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, was released on 25 January 2008. &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; marked the first chapter of &quot;The Wicked Trilogy&quot; concept and was also the first of many Avantasia releases to feature Sascha Paeth on the role of main guitarist and producer. The album included guest performances by drummer Eric Singer, guitarists Henjo Richter and Rudolf Schenker and singers Jørn Lande, Michael Kiske, Bob Catley, Alice Cooper, Roy Khan, Amanda Somerville and Oliver Hartmann.

After the release of &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, Tobias Sammet was invited to perform a headlining show at Wacken Open Air, an offer that producer/guitarist Sascha Paeth convinced him to accept. That led to 13 shows between 5 July and 13 August. The shows at Masters of Rock and Wacken Open Air were recorded and the live DVD The Flying Opera, based on the footage, was released in March 2011. The line-up for the short tour consisted of Tobias Sammet, Andre Matos, Jørn Lande, Kai Hansen, Bob Catley, Amanda Somerville, Cloudy Yang, Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann, Robert Hunecke, Miro and Felix Bohnke (Edguy).
In November 2009, Sammet announced that he was recording two new albums, &quot;The Wicked Symphony&quot; and &quot;Angel of Babylon&quot;, to be released on 3 April 2010. The concept of the albums was a continuation of The Scarecrow story and these three albums together are often referred to as &quot;The Wicked Trilogy&quot;. The special guests included drummers Eric Singer, Alex Holzwarth and Felix Bohnke, guitarists Bruce Kulick and Oliver Hartmann, keyboardist Jens Johansson and vocalists Jørn Lande, Russell Allen, Michael Kiske, Bob Catley, Klaus Meine, Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, Jon Oliva, Andre Matos, Cloudy Yang and Ralf Zdiarstek. &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, &quot;The Wicked Symphony&quot; and &quot;Angel of Babylon&quot; have scored high positions in various international music charts.

A 12 show tour of Europe, South America and Asia took place during December 2010, with the exception of one concert at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2011. The concerts lasted for almost three hours and many of them were sold out days before. The ensemble was almost the same as on The Scarecrow Tour in 2008, with two changes. Andre Matos was replaced by ex-Helloween and current Unisonic singer Michael Kiske (with Kai Hansen also participating on this tour, there were a lot of instances when the two ex-Helloween members shared the same stage) and the fact that Cloudy Yang was not part of the line-up.

Both tours were closely documented by Amanda Somerville on her YouTube channel. The videos show various interesting backstage moments such as rehearsals, cancelled flights, or the ensemble travelling by a regular train.

===The &quot;Ghostlights&quot; saga (2012–2017)===

In August 2012, Sammet announced that &quot;&quot;I didn‘t foresee how much I need Avantasia when I decided to finish this chapter of my life in 2011. After the worldwide success of the latest studio releases, an arena world tour that was sold out pretty much everywhere, collaborations with childhood heroes...I &#x27;knew&#x27; that I had said everything I could possibly say in the name of Avantasia. But that&#x27;s not what Avantasia is all about. I wanna create more great music, I wanna create more fantasy-worlds, the bigger and the more epic, the better. And listening to the material that I have created for this forthcoming chapter in the history of Avantasia, I know there is no way I am not going to do it! I have got the feeling and the certainty, that this is absolutely meant to happen and to be.&quot;

During December 2012 it was revealed on Sammet&#x27;s Avantasia website that the new album would be called &quot;The Mystery of Time&quot; and was due for release on 30 March 2013. &quot;The Mystery of Time&quot; marked the beginning of a new concept and was the first Avantasia release to feature the German Film Orchestra Babelsberg. The album included guest performances by drummer Russell Gilbrook, guitarists Bruce Kulick, Oliver Hartmann and Arjen Anthony Lucassen, while the guest vocalists were Joe Lynn Turner, Biff Byford, Michael Kiske, Ronnie Atkins, Eric Martin, Bob Catley and Cloudy Yang. &quot;The Mystery Of Time&quot; scored high positions in several international music charts and even enabled the project to enter the US Billboard charts for the very first time.

Avantasia&#x27;s second biggest world tour took place between April and August 2013. The tour consisted of 30 concerts and included 7 headlining festival appearances in Europe, one festival performance in Canada and three hour long shows in South America, Japan, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Holland. The line-up for the tour consisted of vocalists Tobias Sammet, Michael Kiske, Ronnie Atkins, Eric Martin, Bob Catley, Thomas Rettke, Amanda Somerville and musicians Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann, Miro, Andre Neygenfind and Felix Bohnke.
According to Sammet: &quot;I wanna put on the biggest thing you have ever seen, I wanna bring more vocalists, play longer shows, and just make it a giant Rock Opera. I love to headline festivals, you run over people in 90 minutes and kick ass. But I also like to do our own Avantasia indoor tour because we can make it much more Avantasia oriented and play almost three hours...It will be huge.&quot;&quot;

With two shows remaining at the end of the tour, Sammet held a press conference in which he announced that Avantasia would perform a headline performance at Wacken Open Air Festival in 2014. He also indicated that this would be a farewell performance as no further Avantasia activities were planned for the near future:


In a May 2014 interview regarding Edguy&#x27;s then latest release &quot;Space Police: Defenders of the Crown&quot;, Sammet said that &quot;The Mystery of Time&quot; hinted at a possible sequel. The new album, entitled &quot;Ghostlights&quot;, was released on 29 January 2016 and featured guest performances by guitarists Bruce Kulick and Oliver Hartmann, while the guest vocalists were Jørn Lande, Michael Kiske, Dee Snider, Geoff Tate, Marko Hietala, Ronnie Atkins, Sharon den Adel, Bob Catley, Robert Mason and Herbie Langhans. Ghostlights scored the highest positions of any Avantasia release in several international music charts and even enabled Avantasia to enter the US Billboard charts for the second time.

The &quot;biggest world tour so far&quot; took place between March and August 2016. According to Avantasia&#x27;s website it consisted of approximately 40 concerts in Europe, North America, South America, Canada, Japan, Russia and Scandinavia. With the exclusion of 8 headlining European summer festival performances, each concert lasted for over three hours. The ensemble was almost the same as on the previous tour with the addition of Jørn Lande and Herbie Langhans. As he did after announcing the 2014 Wacken performance, Sammet once again suggested that the Ghostlights World Tour might be the project&#x27;s last activity in a long time:

After the completion of the tour, Avantasia headlined both Wacken Open Air and Barcelona Rockfest during the summer of 2017.

===The &quot;Moonglow&quot; saga (2018–2023)===
In March 2018, Sammet posted a picture on his Facebook announcing he had begun the creative process regarding the eighth Avantasia album.

On 10 October Nuclear Blast officially announced the new album &quot;Moonglow&quot; would be released on 15 February 2019, and would feature guest vocals by Jørn Lande, Geoff Tate, Ronnie Atkins, Hansi Kürsch, Bob Catley, Michael Kiske, Candice Night, Eric Martin and Mille Petrozza. Subsequently, the album was accompanied by the &quot;Moonglow World Tour&quot; &quot;2019&quot; consisting of 29 concerts across Europe, Australia, and the United States and South America taking place between March and June 2019.

In March 2020, Tobias posted that he is about to start working on a successor album to &quot;Moonglow&quot;. The writing of the new album was in progress throughout 2020 and 2021. The album was released on 21 October 2022 under the title &quot;A Paranormal Evening with the Moonflower Society&quot; and featured guest vocals by Floor Jansen, Jørn Lande, Michael Kiske, Ralf Scheepers, Bob Catley, Geoff Tate, Eric Martin and Ronnie Atkins.

===Here Be Dragons (2024–present)===
In July 2024, Sammet announced Avantasia&#x27;s 10th album, &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; with an accompanying tour. The album was released February 28th, 2025 to mostly positive reviews, with Paul Monkhouse of metalplanetmusic.com calling it &quot;their finest work yet&quot;. Steel Druhm of angrymetalguy.com took a more negative view of the album, calling it &quot;my least favorite Avantasia album thus far.&quot;

<text>Tachyon condensation is a process in particle physics in which a system can lower its potential energy by spontaneously producing particles. The end result is a &quot;condensate&quot; of particles that fills the volume of the system. Tachyon condensation is closely related to second-order phase transitions.

==Technical overview==
Tachyon condensation is a process in which a tachyonic field—usually a scalar field—with a complex mass acquires a vacuum expectation value and reaches the minimum of the potential energy. While the field is tachyonic and unstable near the local maximum of the potential, the field gets a non-negative squared mass and becomes stable near the minimum.

The appearance of tachyons is a potentially serious problem for any theory; examples of tachyonic fields amenable to condensation are all cases of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In condensed matter physics a notable example is ferromagnetism; in particle physics the best known example is the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model that breaks the electroweak symmetry.

==Condensation evolution==
Although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not quantized. Rather, the scalar field is; even for tachyonic quantum fields, the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute (or anticommute), thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate faster than light, and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally (there is no violation of causality).

The &quot;imaginary mass&quot; really means that the system becomes unstable. The zero value field is at a local maximum rather than a local minimum of its potential energy, much like a ball at the top of a hill. A very small impulse (which will always happen due to quantum fluctuations) will lead the field to roll down with exponentially increasing amplitudes toward the local minimum. In this way, tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared, such as the Higgs boson.

==In string theory==
In the late 1990s, Ashoke Sen conjectured that the tachyons carried by open strings attached to D-branes in string theory reflect the instability of the D-branes with respect to their complete annihilation. The total energy carried by these tachyons has been calculated in string field theory; it agrees with the total energy of the D-branes, and all other tests have confirmed Sen&#x27;s conjecture as well. Tachyons therefore became an active area of interest in the early 2000s.

The character of closed-string tachyon condensation is more subtle, though the first steps towards our understanding of their fate have been made by Adams, Polchinski, and Silverstein, in the case of twisted closed string tachyons, and by Simeon Hellerman and Ian Swanson, in a wider array of cases. The fate of the closed string tachyon in the 26-dimensional bosonic string theory remains unknown, though recent progress has revealed interesting new developments.

<text>Across the many fields concerned with interactivity, including information science, computer science, human-computer interaction, communication, and industrial design, there is little agreement over the meaning of the term &quot;interactivity&quot;, but most definitions are related to interaction between users and computers and other machines through a user interface. Interactivity can however also refer to interaction between people. It nevertheless usually refers to interaction between people and computers – and sometimes to interaction between computers – through software, hardware, and networks.

Multiple views on interactivity exist. In the &quot;contingency view&quot; of interactivity, there are three levels: 
#Not interactive, when a message is not related to previous messages.
#Reactive, when a message is related only to one immediately previous message.
#Interactive, when a message is related to a number of previous messages and to the relationship between them.

One body of research has made a strong distinction between interaction and interactivity. As the suffix &#x27;ity&#x27; is used to form nouns that denote a quality or condition, this body of research has defined interactivity as the &#x27;quality or condition of interaction&#x27;. These researchers suggest that the distinction between interaction and interactivity is important since interaction may be present in any given setting, but the quality of the interaction varies from low and high.

==Human to human communication==
Human communication is the basic example of interactive communication which involves two different processes; human to human interactivity and human to computer interactivity. Human-Human interactivity is the communication between people. The word interactivity is related to and stems from the term interaction used by sociologists, which is the actions of at least two individuals who exchange or interplay.  It requires levels of messages that respond to previous messages. Interactivity also refers to a communication systems ability to &quot;talk back&quot;.

On the other hand, human to computer communication is the way that people communicate with new media. According to Rada Roy, the &quot;Human Computer interaction model might consists of 4 main components which consist of human, computer, task environment and machine environment. The two basic flows of information and control are assumed. The communication between people and computers; one must understand something about both and about the tasks which people perform with computers. A general model of human - computer interface emphasizes the flow of information and control at the human computer interface.&quot; Human to Human interactivity consists of many conceptualizations which are based on anthropomorphic definitions. For example, complex systems that detect and react to human behavior are sometimes called interactive. Under this perspective, interaction includes responses to human physical manipulation like movement, body language, and/or changes in mental states.

==Human to artifact communication==
In the context of communication between a human and an artifact, interactivity refers to the artifact&#x27;s interactive behaviour as experienced by the human user. This is different from other aspects of the artifact such as its visual appearance, its internal working, and the meaning of the signs it might mediate. For example, the interactivity of an iPod is not its physical shape and colour (its so-called &quot;design&quot;), its ability to play music, or its storage capacity—it is the behaviour of its user interface as experienced by its user. This includes the way the user moves their finger on its input wheel, the way this allows the selection of a tune in the playlist, and the way the user controls the volume.

An artifact&#x27;s interactivity is best perceived through use. A bystander can imagine how it would be like to use an artifact by watching others use it, but it is only through actual use that its interactivity is fully experienced and &quot;felt&quot;. This is due to the kinesthetic nature of the interactive experience. It is similar to the difference between watching someone drive a car and actually driving it. It is only through the driving that one can experience and &quot;feel&quot; how this car differs from others.

New Media academic Vincent Maher defines interactivity as &quot;the relation constituted by a symbolic interface between its referential, objective functionality and the subject.&quot;

== Computing science ==
The term &quot;look and feel&quot; is often used to refer to the specifics of a computer system&#x27;s user interface. Using this metaphor, the &quot;look&quot; refers to its visual design, while the &quot;feel&quot; refers to its interactivity. Indirectly this can be regarded as an informal definition of interactivity.

For a more detailed discussion of how interactivity has been conceptualized in the human-computer interaction literature, and how the phenomenology of the French philosopher Merleau-Ponty can shed light on the user experience, see (Svanaes 2000).

An IBM study in the early 1980s found that productivity on a computer is highest when the graphical screen updates in one half second or faster; between one half second to three quarters of one second, productivity greatly decreases. In computer science, interactive refers to software which accepts and responds to input from people—for example, data or commands. Interactive software includes most popular programs, such as word processors or spreadsheet applications. By comparison, noninteractive programs operate without human contact; examples of these include compilers and batch processing applications. If the response is complex enough it is said that the system is conducting social interaction and some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of social interfaces.

==Creating interactivity==
Web interactivity refers to interactive features that are embedded on websites that offer an exchange of information either between communication technology and users or between users using technology. This type of interactivity evolves with new developments of website interfaces. Some interactive features include hyperlinks, feedback, and multimedia displays. Wikipedia is also an example of web interactivity because it is written in a collaborative way. Interactivity in new media distinguishes itself from old media by implementing participation from users rather than passive consumption.

Web page authors can integrate JavaScript coding to create interactive web pages. Sliders, date pickers, drag and dropping are just some of the many enhancements that can be provided.

Various authoring tools are available for creating various kinds of interactivities. Some common platforms for creating interactivities include Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight. Notable authoring tools for creating interactivities include Harbinger&#x27;s Elicitus.

eLearning makes use of a concept called an interaction model. Using an interaction model, any person can create interactivities in a very short period of time. Some of the interaction models presented with authoring tools fall under various categories like games, puzzles, simulation tools, presentation tools, etc., which can be completely customized.

<doc id="644530" wikidata="Q1575653" url="?curid=644530" title="Hanley">
<text>Hanley is one of the six towns that, along with Burslem, Longton, Fenton, Tunstall and Stoke-upon-Trent, amalgamated to form the City of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. The town is the main business, commercial and cultural hub of the wider Potteries area. 

==History==

===Etymology===
The name Hanley comes from either &quot;haer lea&quot;, meaning &quot;high meadow&quot;, or &quot;heah lea&quot; meaning &quot;rock meadow&quot;.

===Municipal origins===

Hanley was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1857 and became a county borough with the passage of the Local Government Act 1888. It was based at Hanley Town Hall. In 1910, along with Burslem, Tunstall, Fenton, Longton and Stoke-upon-Trent it was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. Hanley was the only one of the six towns to be a county borough before the merger; its status was transferred to the enlarged borough. In 1925, following the granting of city status, it became one of the six towns that constitute the City of Stoke-on-Trent.

===Coal mining===
At one time, there were many coal mines in North Staffordshire. Hanley Deep Pit was opened in 1854. It was the deepest pit in the North Staffordshire coalfield, reaching a depth of 1500 feet. At its peak in the 1930s it employed some 2,000 men and boys often producing of coal a week. The pit was closed in 1962 but much of the headgear and spoilheaps were left in situ. Then, in the 1980s, the original site was cleared, landscaped and converted into Central Forest Park. Coal miners in the Hanley and Longton area ignited the 1842 General Strike and associated Pottery Riots. The College Road drill hall was completed in 1903.

===Garden Festival===
The 1986 Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival led to the reclamation of large areas of land west of the city centre area – including the former Shelton steelworks, which had been derelict since 1978. When the Garden Festival closed, the land remained derelict for some time, before being re-developed partly into public parkland and partly for retail and leisure.

==Public transport==
In 2013, a new bus station opened in Hanley. This replaced the former bus station, on Lichfield Street. The new bus station was the first stage in the regeneration project which will see the previous bus station demolished, and replaced with a new centre consisting of shops, restaurants and a cinema. The new bus station is bigger than its predecessor, and has seen various routes in and out of the city changed to accommodate its location. The bus station features a sheltered waiting area, Spar shop, cafe and toilets, is covered by CCTV, and has digital timetables showing information on travel times for the day, as well as Now/Next above the entrance to each bay. Access to the station is controlled by automatic doors, at both the pedestrian entrance and coach bays.

The new bus station links Hanley with towns in North Staffordshire, as well as Buxton, Crewe, Shrewsbury, and Stafford. Most services are run by First Potteries, though there are a number of smaller independent operators, such as D&amp;G Bus, and Arriva Midlands. In addition, National Express Coaches connect Hanley with destinations including London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, with additional seasonal services to holiday destinations. As part of the redevelopment of the town and wider city, a new bus interchange was opened on John Street in March 2013, allowing the current station to be demolished to make room for further redevelopment of the town.

Hanley no longer has a railway station but there was once one located on Trinity Street, on the Potteries Loop Line, which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway for passengers on 13 July 1864. The station survived for 100 years – it was closed in 1964, as part of the Beeching Axe, and the land is now a car park. The nearest railway station is in , south-southwest of Hanley bus station.

Hanley is connected to the waterways network; it meets the Trent and Mersey Canal at Festival Park, it is also connected to the east of the country via the Cauldon Canal.

==Cultural sites==

Hanley has several cultural facilities such as the Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery (a large ceramics collection, and restored Spitfire), the Victoria Hall, the Regent Theatre, BBC Radio Stoke&#x27;s studios are based in the town.

<text>Mark Louis Recchi (; born February 1, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger. He was selected in the fourth round, 67th overall, by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft and played a total of 22 seasons in the NHL for the Penguins, Philadelphia Flyers, Montreal Canadiens, Carolina Hurricanes, Atlanta Thrashers, Tampa Bay Lightning and Boston Bruins. Recchi won the Stanley Cup three times in his playing career: in 1991 with the Penguins, in 2006 with the Hurricanes, and in 2011 with the Bruins. During the 2010-11 season, Recchi was the last active player who had played in the NHL in the 1980s. Subsequently, in Game 2 of the 2011 Finals, Recchi became the oldest player ever to score in a Stanley Cup Finals game at age 43. On June 26, 2017, in his fourth year of eligibility, Recchi was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
Recchi played his junior hockey for the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). His number 8 was retired by the team shortly after he left for the NHL. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins, first playing in the NHL in 1988, and was a key player on their Stanley Cup-winning team in 1991.

The following season, Recchi was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers as part of a deal that brought Rick Tocchet and Kjell Samuelsson to Pittsburgh. He played for Philadelphia from 1992 to 1995 as part of the &quot;Crazy Eights&quot; line with Eric Lindros and Brent Fedyk, including a 53-goal, 70-assist and 123-point season in 1992–93, still the Flyers&#x27; single-season point-scoring record. In 1995, he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in a deal for Éric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair, but was reacquired by the Flyers late in the 1998–99 season and was consistently among their top scorers.

During the 1999–2000 season, Recchi was a finalist for the Lester B. Pearson Award as the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) MVP, and he finished third in scoring, only five points behind winner Jaromír Jágr and runner-up Pavel Bure. Recchi also finished third in voting for the NHL All-Star team right wing position behind Jágr and Bure. In 2000 and 2004, the Flyers would make the Eastern Conference Finals, but they would bow out of each series in seven games.

In 2000, Recchi was named &quot;Kamloops Male Athlete of the 20th Century&quot;, and had a street named &quot;Mark Recchi Way&quot; in his honour.

In August 2004, Recchi rejoined the Pittsburgh Penguins as a free agent, signing a two-year contract with a two-way option for a third year. The first year was eventually nullified by the NHL lock-out; in the second year, with the Penguins languishing at the bottom of the NHL standings, Recchi waived his no-trade clause to be sent to the Stanley Cup-contending Carolina Hurricanes at the deadline for minor-league forward Krys Kolanos, left wing Niklas Nordgren and a 2007 second-round pick. Recchi won his second Stanley Cup with the Hurricanes that season, then re-signed with the Penguins during the summer of 2006 off-season.
On January 20, 2007, he scored his seventh career hat-trick (against the Toronto Maple Leafs), and just under a week later, Recchi scored his 500th career goal on January 26, 2007, on the power play against the Dallas Stars.

During the summer of 2007, Recchi re-signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins on a one-year, $2 million contract, but on December 4, he was placed on waivers and assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, on December 6. The Penguins then placed Recchi on re-entry waivers the next day, where Recchi was claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers. In his first game against his former team, he scored the game-winning goal in a shootout.

On July 7, 2008, Recchi signed a one-year deal as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Lightning. After scoring 45 points in 62 games with the Lightning in the 2008–09 season, and with the Lightning out of playoff contention, on March 4, 2009, Recchi was traded at the trade deadline (along with a second-round pick in 2010) to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Mārtiņš Karsums and Matt Lashoff. Recchi scored his first two goals for the Bruins three days later on March 7, as the first and third Bruins goals in a 5–3 home ice defeat of the visiting Chicago Blackhawks.
On July 2, 2009, Recchi re-signed with the Bruins on a one-year contract. At the time, Recchi had stated that the 2009–10 season would be his final year. With the retirement of Joe Sakic in the summer of 2009, Recchi became the leader in points and assists among active players. Recchi would serve as an alternate captain during the season while Marc Savard was injured and out of the line-up, playing 81 of 82 games in the 2009–10 season.

During the 2010 playoffs, Recchi became the third-oldest player to score a playoff goal, behind Chris Chelios and Gordie Howe, and also became the oldest player to have a multi-goal game in the playoffs when he scored two goals in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in Game 4 of the second round. After suffering defeat in the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Flyers, instead of retiring, Recchi re-signed with the Bruins for a one more year.

In the 2010–11 season on November 24, 2010, Recchi scored twice against the Florida Panthers to earn his 1,500th career point.

In Game 2 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Recchi became the oldest ever player to score a goal in a Stanley Cup Finals, doing so at age 43. In Game 3 of the Finals, he scored the final two goals of his career. On June 15, 2011, Recchi became a three-time winner of the Stanley Cup and joined Jack Marshall, Frank Foyston, Jack Walker, Mike Keane, Claude Lemieux, Hap Holmes, Al Arbour, Gord Pettinger, Larry Hillman, and Joe Nieuwendyk in winning at least three Stanley Cups with three different teams, as the Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Recchi also led the team in scoring during the Finals series.

Having previously announced he would &quot;sail off into the sunset&quot; if Boston were victorious in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, he announced his retirement in an interview with Ron MacLean of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; during the post-game Stanley Cup celebration. Recchi was the last player active in professional hockey who had played in the NHL in the 1980s, finishing his career fourth all-time in games played and 12th all-time in points.

==Post-retirement==
Recchi is a co-owner of the Kamloops Blazers, along with Dallas Stars owner Tom Gaglardi and Jarome Iginla, Shane Doan and Darryl Sydor.

In 2013, Recchi joined the Dallas Stars as a consultant along with former Stars Mike Modano and Marty Turco.

On July 18, 2014, Recchi was hired as the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; player development coach. He was a part of the 2016 and 2017 Stanley Cup champion teams. He was subsequently promoted to director of player development on June 15, 2017. He was named the assistant coach on July 11, 2017, following the departure of Rick Tocchet, who was named the head coach of the Arizona Coyotes.

Recchi did not have his contract renewed by the Penguins following the 2019-20 season.

Recchi was hired by the New Jersey Devils as an assistant coach on September 8, 2020. He was subsequently fired by the Devils on May 4, 2022. The Columbus Blue Jackets hired Recchi as an assistant coach on September 25, 2023.

==Personal life==
Mark Recchi was born on February 1, 1968, to Mel and Ruth Recchi in Kamloops, British Columbia. Mark has three brothers: Marty, Mike and Matt.

Recchi married Kim Lazur on August 20, 2016, and they have two children together. Recchi has six children in total, four from a previous marriage. The children&#x27;s names are: Christina, Bella, Samantha, Brendan, Cameron and Austin.

<text>West Hartlepool was a predecessor of Hartlepool, County Durham, England. It developed in the Victorian era and took the name from its western position in the parish of what is now known as the Headland.

The former town was originally formed in 1848 as an accompanying settlement for nearby railway and docks, which brought and exported coal from the area. The rail network grew, connecting to docks in Leeds and other cities. Further developments in the area led to the 1960s formation of Hartlepool as a town.

==History==

The town of West Hartlepool was founded by Ralph Ward Jackson who went on to become managing director of the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway in 1848.

The area known as Newburn Raw, part of the ancient village of Stranton, steadily grew into a centre for shipping and railway transport. The West Hartlepool Harbour and Dock () opened on 1 June 1847. Five years later, also on 1 June, the Jackson dock () opened as well as a railway connecting West Hartlepool to Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. Massive timber trading with Baltic countries began as timber was needed for pitprops in nearby coal mines. The area&#x27;s population grew quickly as a result. Eight shipbuilding yards were established. Supporting shipbuilding and repair were: a canvas manufacturing firm, Bastow Brothers and W. Taylor iron foundries, block and mast makers and other related machinery.

Streets were laid out along which shops and brick homes were built. Standard town services followed including paved roads, gas and electricity, sewers, a slaughterhouse, cemetery and more.

Jackson built a large church, Christ Church, from stone excavated from the docks and the parish was consecrated in 1854 by the Bishop of Durham. Swainson Dock opened on 3 June 1856, named after Ward Jackson&#x27;s father-in-law. In 1878 the William Gray &amp; Company ship yard in West Hartlepool achieved the distinction of launching the largest tonnage of any shipyard in the world, a feat to be repeated on a number of occasions.

West Hartlepool was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Stranton, The municipal borough of West Hartlepool was created in 1887, and, with its headquarters at West Hartlepool Town Hall, on 31 December 1894 West Hartlepool became a separate civil parish, the district was promoted to the status of county borough, outside the control of Durham County Council, in 1902. On 1 April 1967, a county borough, called Hartlepool, was established by amalgamating West Hartlepool with old Hartlepool, the parish was also abolished and merged with Hartlepool. In 1961 the parish had a population of 77,035.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s Rugby Union football team was formed in 1881 by men who came to the area to build the railway and dig the docks, and continued until 1908 when the Hartlepool Union&#x27;s round ball game was in vogue. Until 1968, the football team now known as Hartlepool United was shown in the plural - Hartlepools United - to show its links to both Hartlepool and to West Hartlepool.

<doc id="644540" wikidata="Q5177623" url="?curid=644540" title="County Borough of Warley">
<text>Warley was a short-lived county borough and civil parish in the geographical county of Worcestershire, England, forming part of the West Midlands conurbation. It was formed in 1966 by the combination of the existing county borough of Smethwick with the municipal boroughs of Oldbury and Rowley Regis, by recommendation of the Local Government Commission for England. It was abolished just 8 years later in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with its area passing to the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell.

==Formation==

The Local Government Act 1958 appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a &quot;West Midlands Special Review Area&quot; as one of five conurbations in which urgent reform was felt to be needed. The commission made its report in July 1961, recommending that the Black Country area of the West Midlands should be administered by five large county boroughs. The proposal to merge the boroughs of Oldbury, Rowley Regis and Smethwick as one of the new authorities was initially suggested by the three councils involved. The government announced that it accepted the proposals in November 1962, and it was originally intended that the County Borough of Warley should come into being on 1 April 1964. The reforms were delayed when five district councils in the review area took legal action in an attempt to prevent their implementation. The legal process was finally concluded in the Court of Appeal in July 1965, with the court ruling in the government&#x27;s favour. Plans for Rowley Regis to be absorbed into an expanded Dudley borough were also considered, while Halesowen was being lined up as the third area to be absorbed into a new borough which also included Oldbury and Smethwick, but this did not happen and the borough of Halesowen survived until it was incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Dudley in 1974.

The Local Government (West Midlands) Order 1965 was made on 3 November 1965, with the changes to come into effect on 1 April 1966. The Order was debated in the House of Commons on 2 December 1965. John Horner, the Labour MP for Oldbury and Halesowen stated that while the boroughs of Oldbury and Rowley Regis had supported the creation of the new county borough in 1961, they no longer did so. In contrast, Peter Griffiths, Conservative member for Smethwick stated that the working party consisting of councillors for the three boroughs had given up their opposition, and were trying to make a success of the new county borough. The group did, however, have objections to boundary changes which caused the transfer of an estate of council houses (next to the West Bromwich Albion F.C. stadium) to West Bromwich.

The borough took its name from the ancient Manor of Warley, listed in the Domesday Survey as covering much of the area. This was subsequently divided into two parts: Warley Salop (in Shropshire) and Warley Wigorn (in Worcestershire). This was united as the civil parish of Warley in 1884, but later divided between the boroughs of Oldbury and Smethwick (Warley Woods).

Smethwick and Rowley Regis had been part of Staffordshire, while Oldbury was part of Worcestershire (having been transferred from Shropshire in 1844). The new county borough was placed entirely in the geographical county of Worcestershire. Part of the Oakham area of Dudley and most of the Tividale area of Tipton were also incorporated into Warley, becoming part of the new Oldbury B69 postal district.

The archives for Warley Borough are held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service.

===Areas transferred===

Source:Vision of Britain

On creation, the county borough was included in the area of the West Midlands Constabulary, which was formed to cover the five Black Country county boroughs formed in 1966. Warley was included in the area of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive in 1969, and nominated one member of the transport authority.

==Borough council==
The first elections to Warley Borough Council were in February 1966, with those elected being a &quot;shadow council&quot; until coming into full powers on 1 April. The Labour Party initially held power, losing it to the Conservatives in 1968. Labour regained control in 1972 at the final borough election before abolition. The county borough was divided into fifteen wards, each returning three councillors and one alderman:
*Abbey
*Bearwood
*Brandhall
*Bristnall
*Cradley Heath
*Langley
*Old Hill and Blackheath
*Rounds Green
*Rowley
*St Paul&#x27;s
*Sandwell
*Soho
*Tividale
*Uplands
*Victoria

The political composition of the borough council was as follows following each election from 1967 to 1972:

In 1967, the first council elections in Warley saw the Labour Party gain control of the council with a narrow majority, although the following year saw the Conservatives gain control with a significant majority, reflecting the slump in popularity of the Labour government across Britain at the time. In 1972, Labour regained control of Warley.

In September 1967, the council appointed Tony O&#x27;Connor as headmaster at what was then Bearwood Junior and Infants School; he is widely held to be the UK&#x27;s first black headmaster.

===Coat of arms===
On 30 June 1966, the College of Arms granted the new county borough armorial bearings. The design incorporated features from the arms of the three merged boroughs. The blazon of the arms was as follows:

&quot;Per saltire vert and or, two lions rampant in pale or, in fess of either flank a club in bend sinister surmounted by a caduceus in bend proper; on a chief or a lion passant vert. And for a crest: Issuant from a Saxon crown or, a demi lion rampant double queued vert holding with the dexter paw an arrow barb downwards proper. Supporters: on the dexter side a lion gules in the mouth an arrow proper; on the sinister side a dragon gules in the mouth an anchor or.&quot;

The &quot;chief&quot; or upper third of the shield bearing a lion passant came from the arms of Rowley Regis, and the &quot;per saltire&quot; division of the arms and green and gold colouring was found in Oldbury&#x27;s insignia. The gold lions on a green background were from the arms of the Robsart family, while the crossed club and caduceus were the arms of James Watt. The crest featured a Saxon crown from which rose a green double-tailed lion, emblem of the Suttons, mediaeval lords of Dudley. The lion held an arrow from the arms of Matthew Boulton. The supporters of the arms were a red lion and dragon. The lion was from the armorial bearings of Sir James Timmins Chance, while the dragon was intended to represent the ancient Britons, founders of the &quot;old burh&quot; or Oldbury. Both animals held objects in their mouths as heraldic differences: an arrow (as in the crest) and an anchor (for Cradley Heath&#x27;s traditional industry). The motto chosen by the borough was &quot;Unity and Progress&quot;.

==Parliamentary constituencies==
The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1970 divided the county borough into two parliamentary constituencies: Warley East and Warley West. The constituencies were first used at the 1974 general election, shortly before the abolition of the borough. They were abolished in 1997, although the borough&#x27;s name lived on until 2024 as the name of Warley constituency which consisted of Oldbury and Smethwick (formerly Warley East). The old Warley West seat was divided between the new constituency of Halesowen and Rowley Regis and an expanded West Bromwich West.

==Abolition==
On the formation of the West Midlands metropolitan county in 1974, the county borough of Warley merged with the county borough of West Bromwich to form the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell. West Bromwich itself had expanded in 1966 to take in the bulk of Tipton and Wednesbury.

<doc id="644544" wikidata="Q213746" url="?curid=644544" title="Augusto César Sandino">
<text>Augusto César Sandino (; 18 May 1895 21 February 1934), full name Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino, was a Nicaraguan revolutionary and leader of a rebellion between 1927 and 1933 against the United States occupation of Nicaragua. Despite being referred to as a &quot;bandit&quot; by the United States government, his exploits made him a hero throughout much of Latin America, where he became a symbol of resistance to American imperialism. Sandino drew units of the United States Marine Corps into an undeclared guerrilla war. The United States troops withdrew from the country in 1933 after overseeing the election and inauguration of President Juan Bautista Sacasa, who had returned from exile.

Sandino was executed in 1934 by National Guard forces of General Anastasio Somoza García, who went on to seize power in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; two years later. After being elected president by an overwhelming margin in 1936, Somoza García resumed control of the National Guard and established a dictatorship and Somoza family dynasty that ruled Nicaragua for more than 40 years. Sandino&#x27;s political legacy was claimed by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), which overthrew the Somoza government in 1979 and then ensconced itself in power for more than 40 years.

Sandino is revered in Nicaragua and in 2010 its congress unanimously named him a &quot;national hero&quot;. His political descendants, the icons of his wide-brimmed hat and boots, and his writings from the years of warfare against the USMC continue to shape Nicaragua&#x27;s national identity.

==Early life==
Augusto Calderón was born 18 May 1895, in Niquinohomo, Masaya Department, Nicaragua. He was the illegitimate son of Gregorio Sandino, a wealthy landowner of Spanish descent, and Margarita Calderón, an indigenous servant with the Sandino family. He lived with his mother until he was nine years old, when his father took him into his own home and arranged for his education. It was then that young Augusto took on his father&#x27;s surname, retaining his maternal surname, Calderón, as a middle name represented by the initial C.

In July 1912, when he was 17, Sandino witnessed an intervention of United States troops in Nicaragua to suppress an uprising against President Adolfo Díaz, regarded by many as a United States puppet. General Benjamín Zeledón of La Concordia in the state of Jinotega died that year on 4 October during the Battle of Coyotepe Hill, when United States Marines recaptured Fort Coyotepe and the city of Masaya from rebels. The Marines carried Zeledón&#x27;s body on an oxcart to be buried in Catarina.

==Attempted murder and exile in Mexico==
In 1921 at the age of 26, Sandino shot but failed to kill Dagoberto Rivas, the son of a prominent conservative townsman, who had made disparaging comments about Sandino&#x27;s mother. As a result, Sandino fled to Honduras, then Guatemala and eventually Mexico, where he found work at a Standard Oil refinery near the port of Tampico. At that time the military phase of the Mexican Revolution was drawing to an end. A new &quot;institutional revolutionary&quot; regime was forming, driven by a wide array of popular movements to carry out the provisions of the 1917 Constitution. Sandino was involved with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, spiritist gurus and anti-imperialist, anarchist and communist revolutionaries. He embraced the anti-clericalism of Mexico&#x27;s revolution and the ideology of &quot;Indigenismo,&quot; which glorified the indigenous heritage of Latin America.

==Emergence as guerrilla leader==
Shortly after Sandino returned to Nicaragua, the Constitutionalist War began when Liberal soldiers in the Caribbean port of Puerto Cabezas revolted against the Conservative President Adolfo Díaz, who had recently been installed after a coup with United States involvement. The leader of this revolt, General José María Moncada, declared that he supported the claim of the exiled Liberal vice-president Juan Bautista Sacasa.

Sacasa returned to Nicaragua, arriving in Puerto Cabezas in December, and declared himself president of a &quot;constitutional&quot; government, which Mexico recognized. Sandino assembled a makeshift army composed largely of gold miners, and led a failed attack on the Conservative garrison nearest the San Albino mine. Afterward, he traveled to Puerto Cabezas to meet with Moncada. Because of the guerrilla&#x27;s hit-and-run operations against Conservative forces, conducted independently of the Liberal army, Moncada distrusted Sandino and told Sacasa so. Sacasa denied the unknown Sandino&#x27;s requests for weapons and a military commission. But after he captured some rifles from fleeing Conservative soldiers, the other Liberal commanders agreed to grant Sandino a commission.

By 1927 Sandino had returned to &quot;Las Segovias&quot;, where he recruited local peasants for his army and attacked government troops with increasing success. In April Sandino&#x27;s forces played a vital role in assisting the principal Liberal Army column, which was advancing on Managua. Having received arms and funding from Mexico, Moncada&#x27;s Liberal army seemed on the verge of seizing the capital. But the United States, using the threat of military intervention, forced the Liberal generals to agree to a ceasefire.

On 4 May 1927, representatives from the two warring factions signed the Espino Negro accord, negotiated by Henry L. Stimson, appointed by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge as a special envoy to Nicaragua. Under the terms of the accord, both sides agreed to disarm, Díaz would be allowed to finish his term, and a new national army would be established, to be called the Guardia Nacional (National Guard). U.S. soldiers were to remain in the country to supervise the upcoming November presidential election. A battalion of U.S. Marines under the command of Major General Logan Feland later arrived to enforce the agreement.

After the signing of the Espino Negro accord, Sandino refused to order his followers to surrender their weapons, and returned with them to the Segovia Mountains.

==Marriage and family==
During this period, Sandino married Blanca Stella Aráuz Pineda, a young telegraphist of the village of San Rafael del Norte, Jinotega.

==Declaring war on the United States==
In June 1927, Sandino organised a group of 50 men to march to the San Albino mines in Nueva Segovia, where he was formerly employed by American businessman Charles Butters. Sandino took over the mine, which held 500 pounds of dynamite he said was going to use to &quot;kill Yankees&quot;, and forcibly drove out all foreigners. This led to foreigners criticizing America and how the Marines deployed in Nicaragua were ordered to protect only American property, not foreigners&#x27;.

At the beginning of July 1927, Sandino issued a manifesto condemning the betrayal of the Liberal revolution by the &quot;vendepatria&quot; (&quot;country-seller&quot;) Moncada. He declared war on the United States, which he called the &quot;Colossus of the North&quot; and &quot;the enemy of our race&quot;. At the height of his guerrilla campaign, Sandino claimed to have 3,000 soldiers in his army; in later years, officials estimated the number at 300.

On 16 July, Sandino&#x27;s followers attacked a patrol of U.S. Marines and the Nicaraguan Guardia Nacional was sent to apprehend him at the village of Ocotal. Armed primarily with machetes and 19th-century rifles, they attempted to besiege the Marines, but were easily repulsed with the help of one of the first dive-bombing attacks in history, conducted by five Marine de Havilland biplanes. The Marine commander estimated that 300 of Sandino&#x27;s men died (the actual number was about 80), while the Marines suffered two casualties, one dead and one wounded, and the Guardia three dead and four taken prisoner. Despite their heavy losses and the lopsided nature of these battles, the rebels made other attempts to swarm a small post guarded by 21 Marines and 25 guardsmen at Telpaneca. The 200 assaulting Sandinistas had 25 deaths and 50 wounded while killing one Marine, wounding another and seriously injuring a guardsman.

Later Sandino took the more official title Augusto César Sandino and renamed his insurgents &quot;The Army in Defense of the National Sovereignty of Nicaragua&quot;. Efforts by the Marines to kill or capture him over the summer failed. In November 1927, U.S. aircraft succeeded in locating El Chipote, Sandino&#x27;s remote mountain headquarters east of San Albino Mine. But when the Marines reached it, they found it abandoned and guarded by straw dummies. Sandino and his followers had long since escaped.

In January 1928 U.S. Marines found Sandino&#x27;s war base in Quilalí and, though they were ambushed in their approach, the American and Nicaraguan troops had no trouble in routing the 400 rebels under Francisco Estrada&#x27;s leadership. The Marines lost one man while killing 20. Sandino&#x27;s penchant for exaggeration was evident in his personal report of the events: he claimed to have won the battle in three hours and that 97 Americans were killed and another 60 wounded. In reality only 66 Marines were in the operation. He further boasted the capture of six Lewis machine guns, three M1921 Thompsons and 46 Lewis automatic rifles. Also among these trophies was a codebook for communicating with aircraft.

After reaching the mountains of Nueva Segovia, Sandino smuggled a message to Mexico City saying:
I will not abandon my resistance until the ... pirate invaders ... assassins of weak peoples ... are expelled from my country. ... I will make them realize that their crimes will cost them dear. ... There will be bloody combat. ... Nicaragua shall not be the patrimony of Imperialists. I will fight for my cause as long as my heart beats. ... If through destiny I should lose, there are in my arsenal five tons of dynamite which I will explode with my own hand. The noise of the cataclysm will be heard 250 miles. All who hear will be witness that Sandino is dead. Let it not be permitted that the hands of traitors or invaders shall profane his remains.

In April the Sandinistas destroyed the equipment of the Bonanza and La Luz gold mines, the two largest mines in the country, both owned by three American brothers: James Gilmore, G. Fred, and D. Watson Fletcher, all of Manhattan, who were brothers of Henry P. Fletcher, the United States Ambassador to Italy. After destroying the Fletchers&#x27; mines, Sandino wrote that he was targeting not just U.S. Marines but also Americans in Nicaragua who &quot;uphold the attitude of Coolidge.&quot;

With aerial support, the Marines made several riverine patrols from Nicaragua&#x27;s east coast up the Coco River during the height of the rainy season, often having to use native dugout canoes. While these patrols limited Sandino&#x27;s forces&#x27; movements and secured tenuous control over northern Nicaragua&#x27;s principal river, the Marines failed to find Sandino or to effect a decisive victory. By April 1928 the Marines reportedly thought Sandino was finished and trying to evade capture. One month later, his army ambushed another Marine post and killed five troops. In December 1928 the Marines located Sandino&#x27;s mother and convinced her to write a letter asking him to surrender. Sandino announced that he would continue to fight until the Marines left Nicaragua.

Despite massive efforts, American forces never captured Sandino. His communiqués were regularly published in American media; for instance, he was frequently quoted during 1928 in &quot;Time&quot; magazine during the Marines&#x27; offensive. At one point he staged a fake funeral to throw off pursuers. The U.S. Congress did not share Coolidge&#x27;s ambition to capture Sandino and declined to fund operations to do so. U.S. Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana argued that if American soldiers intended to &quot;stamp out banditry, let&#x27;s send them to Chicago to stamp it out there ... I wouldn&#x27;t sacrifice ... one American boy for all the damn Nicaraguans.&quot;

==Efforts at winning recognition==
===The Struggle===
Having addressed his declaration of war to the whole of the &quot;Indo-Hispanic race&quot;, Sandino saw his struggle in racial terms, as the defense not only of Nicaragua but of the whole of Latin America. At the beginning of his rebellion, Sandino appointed the Honduran poet, journalist and diplomat, Froylán Turcios, as his official foreign representative. Residing in Tegucigalpa, Turcios received and distributed Sandino&#x27;s communiques, manifests and reports; he also acted as his liaison to sympathizers who provided him with arms and volunteers. Working with a number of prominent Nicaraguan exiles, Turcios sought to build support for Sandino&#x27;s struggle in other Central American nations and in Mexico, which had backed the Liberals during the Constitutionalist War. In Mexico, Sandino&#x27;s principal representative was the Nicaraguan exile Pedro Zepeda, who had previously served as the liaison between Sacasa and the Mexican government.

Sandino&#x27;s principal demands were the resignation of President Díaz, withdrawal of U.S. troops, new elections to be supervised by Latin American countries, and the abrogation of the Bryan–Chamorro Treaty (which gave the United States the exclusive right to build a canal across Nicaragua). In October 1928, José María Moncada was elected as president, in a process supervised by the United States, which proved a major setback for Sandino&#x27;s claim to be acting in defense of the Liberal revolution.

Prior to the election, Sandino had attempted, with three other marginal factions, to organize a &quot;junta&quot; to be headed by Zepeda. In an organizing pact, Sandino took the role of &quot;Generalissimo&quot; and the sole military authority of the republic. Following the election of Moncada, Sandino ruled out negotiations with his former rival and declared the elections unconstitutional. In an attempt to outmanoeuvre the general, Sandino expanded his demands to include the restoration of the United Provinces of Central America.

He made this demand a central component of his political platform. In a letter he wrote in March 1929 to the Argentine President Hipólito Yrigoyen, &quot;Plan for Realizing Bolívar&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Sandino outlined a more ambitious political project. He proposed a conference in Buenos Aires to be attended by all Latin American nations, which would work toward their political unification as an entity he called the &quot;Indo-Latin American Continental and Antillean Federation&quot;. He proposed that the unified entity would resist further domination by the United States and be able to ensure that the proposed Nicaragua Canal would remain under Latin American control.

===Solidarity with foreign nations===
As Sandino&#x27;s success grew, he began to receive symbolic gestures of support from the Soviet Union and the Comintern. The Pan-American Anti-Imperialist League, supervised by the South American Bureau of the Comintern, issued a number of statements in support of Sandino. Within the United States, the U.S. branch of the Anti-Imperialist League publicized opposition to the actions of the U.S. government in Nicaragua. Sandino&#x27;s half-brother Sócrates, who lived in New York City, was featured as a speaker at several rallies against American involvement in Nicaragua, which were organized by the League and the U.S. Communist Party. The Sixth World Congress of the Comintern, meeting in Moscow in the summer of 1928, issued a statement &quot;expressing solidarity with the workers and peasants of Nicaragua and the heroic army of national emancipation of General Sandino&quot;. In China, a division of the Kuomintang army that seized Beijing in 1928 was named &quot;the Sandino brigade.&quot; The following June, Sandino appointed a representative to the Second Congress of the World Anti-Imperialist League in Frankfurt.

===Year-long exile in Mexico===
Sandino&#x27;s relations with Turcios soured, as Turcios disliked the Junta proposal. Sandino criticized him for siding with Honduras in a border dispute with Guatemala, which Sandino saw as a distraction from the goal of Central American unification. Conflict between the two men led Turcios to resign in January 1929, which resulted in cutting off the flow of arms to Sandino&#x27;s forces and leaving them increasingly isolated from potential supporters outside Nicaragua. Sandino&#x27;s army suffered a major blow in February 1929 when Gen. Manuel María Jirón, who masterminded his raids, was captured by U.S. Marines. More defeats for Sandino&#x27;s army at the hands of the Marines soon followed. In an effort to secure military and financial support, Sandino wrote letters appealing to various Latin American leaders. Sandino looked for aid from revolutionary Mexico, but the country had taken an anti-communist turn under the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler Plutarco Elías Calles. Sandino also wrote a letter that was sent to Al Capone in Chicago. Mr. Capone was uninterested in personally helping Sandino. Mr. Capone then hand delivered the letter to Tony Eduardo Delduca leader of the Purple Gang 1929 to 1935. Mr. Delduca had followed the stories of Sandino in the press and was very proud and honored to help Sandino. The Packard car in the picture is a present for Sandino from Mr. Delduca.
After failing to negotiate his surrender in exchange for a withdrawal of U.S. troops, the Mexican President Emilio Portes Gil offered Sandino asylum. The leading guerrilla left Nicaragua in June 1929. In the political climate of the &quot;Maximato,&quot; Sandino&#x27;s radicalism was unwelcome. To appease the United States, the Mexican government confined Sandino to the city of Mérida. Living at a hotel, Sandino was still able to maintain contact with his supporters. He traveled to Mexico City and met with Portes Gil, but his request for support was quickly rebuffed. The Mexican Communist Party offered to pay for Sandino to travel to Europe, but the offer was withdrawn after he refused to issue a statement condemning the Mexican government. In April 1930, as Sandino&#x27;s relations with the Communists grew increasingly cool, they leaked information suggesting that Sandino was critical of Portes Gil&#x27;s government. Put at risk in Mexico, Sandino left the country and returned to Nicaragua.

===EMECU===
During his period in Mexico, he had become a member of the Magnetic-Spiritualist School of the Universal Commune (EMECU). Founded in Buenos Aires in 1911 by Joaquín Trincado, a Basque electrician, the EMECU blended the political ideals of anarchism with a cosmology which was an idiosyncratic synthesis of Zoroastrianism, Kabbalah and Spiritism. Rejecting both capitalism and Bolshevism, Trincado&#x27;s brand of communism was based on a &quot;spiritism of Light and Truth,&quot; which he believed would supersede all existing religions in the final stage of human history. This stage, which would arise from the political conflicts of the 20th century, would be the time of the founding of the &quot;universal commune&quot;, in which private property and the state would be abolished, the hatred caused by false religions would disappear, and all of humanity would be part of one race (Hispanic) and speak one language (Spanish).

Although Sandino had communicated with Trincado only through a series of letters, after his return to Nicaragua, his manifests and his personal affiliations were increasingly shaped by his applying the ideals of the EMECU. He named Tricado as one of his official representatives and replaced the former seal (with an image of a campesino beheading a U.S. Marine) with the symbol of EMECU. His distrust of his former Communist associates led him to break off relations with Farabundo Martí, a Salvadoran who was formerly one of his most trusted lieutenants, and accused Martí of spying for the Communists. In February 1931, Sandino issued his &quot;Manifest of Light and Truth&quot;, which reflected a new millenarian tone in his beliefs. The manifest proclaimed the coming of the Last Judgment, a time of &quot;the destruction of injustice on the earth and the reign of the Spirit of Light and Truth, that is, Love.&quot; He said that Nicaragua had been chosen to play a central role in this struggle, and his army was an instrument of divine justice. &quot;The honor has fallen to us, brothers, that in Nicaragua we have been chosen by Divine Justice to begin the prosecution of injustice on earth.&quot;

==U.S. withdrawal==
Although Sandino had been unable to secure any outside aid for his forces, the Great Depression made overseas military expeditions too costly for the United States. In January 1931, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Stimson announced that all U.S. soldiers in Nicaragua would be withdrawn after the 1932 election in the country. The newly created Nicaraguan National Guard (&quot;Guardia Nacional&quot;), which continued to be commanded by U.S. officers, took over responsibility for controlling insurgencies.

In May 1931, an earthquake destroyed Managua, killing over 2,000 people. The disruption and the losses the earthquake caused weakened the central government and gave Sandino leverage to revive his fight with the Americans. In the summer of 1931, Sandinista bands were active in every department north of Managua and conducted raids into the southern and western parts of the country, the departments of Estelí, Jinotega, León and Chontales. They briefly managed to occupy several towns along the nation&#x27;s principal railroad, linking Managua to the Pacific coastal port of Corinto, but did not try to capture any of the nation&#x27;s urban centers. They briefly occupied some smaller cities, such as Chinandega.

In accordance with the Good Neighbor Policy, the last U.S. Marines left Nicaragua in January 1933, after Juan Bautista Sacasa&#x27;s inauguration as the country&#x27;s president. During the Marines&#x27; tour of duty in Nicaragua, 130 of their men had been killed. After the Marines departed, Sandino said, &quot;I salute the American people.&quot; He also vowed that he would never attack a working-class American who visited Nicaragua. Sandino met with Sacasa in Managua in February 1933, pledged his loyalty to him and agreed to order his forces to surrender their weapons within three months. In exchange, Sacasa agreed to give the soldiers who surrendered arms squatters&#x27; rights on land in the Coco River Valley, require the area to be guarded by 100 Sandinista fighters under the government&#x27;s orders, and give preference in employment to Sandinistas on public works in northern Nicaragua.

Sandino remained opposed to the Nicaraguan National Guard, which he considered unconstitutional because of its ties to the U.S. military, and insisted on its dissolution. His attitude toward General Anastasio Somoza García, the National Guard leader, and his officers made Sandino unpopular with rank-and-file National Guard troops. Without consulting Sacasa, Somoza García ordered Sandino&#x27;s execution in the hope that it would help win him loyalty from the Guard&#x27;s senior officers.

==Death==
On 21 February 1934, Sandino; his father; his brother Sócrates; two of his favorite generals, Estranda and Umanzor; and the poet Sofonías Salvatierra, Sacasa&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture, attended a new round of talks with Sacasa. On leaving Sacasa&#x27;s Presidential Palace, the six men were stopped in their car at the main gate by local National Guardsmen and were ordered to leave their car. The Guardsmen brushed aside Sandino&#x27;s father and Salvatierra. They took Sandino, his brother Sócrates, and his two generals to a crossroads section in Larreynaga and executed them. Sandino&#x27;s remains were buried in the Larreynaga neighborhood of Managua by a detachment of National Guard troops under the command of Major Rigoberto Duarte, one of General Somoza García&#x27;s confidantes. Duarte was the father of Roberto Duarte Solis, Minister of Social Communication during President Arnoldo Alemán&#x27;s tenure.

The following day, the National Guard attacked Sandino&#x27;s army in force and, over a month, destroyed it. Two years later, General Somoza García forced Sacasa to resign and declared himself President of Nicaragua. He established a dictatorship and dynasty that dominated Nicaragua for the next four decades.

Sandino&#x27;s body has never been found, and the full details of his execution and what became of his remains are among Nicaragua&#x27;s most enduring mysteries. Some theories about the disposition of Sandino’s body include:
* Burial: witnesses to the execution claimed to have seen the guardsmen force Sandino and the three other captives to the ground and shoot and bury them. Sandino&#x27;s followers are said to have later exhumed Sandino&#x27;s body to rebury him in an undisclosed location.
* Cremated: in 1944, ten years after Sandino&#x27;s execution, the remains that had been buried in the La Calavera pit were exhumed and taken near the south side of the Tiscapa lagoon to be burned, then their ashes thrown into Lake Xolotlán. This occurred due to the student protests of the Central University of Managua that took place that year, against the re-election of Somoza to the presidency. 
* Trophy: according to Sandinista lore, Somoza&#x27;s executors decapitated and dismembered Sandino and delivered his severed head to the U.S. government as a token of their loyalty.

==Legacy==
Sandino became a hero to many in Nicaragua and much of Latin America as a Robin Hood figure who opposed domination from wealthy elites and foreigners, such as the United States. His opposition to U.S. control was tempered by the love he said he felt toward Americans like himself. His picture and silhouette, complete with the oversized cowboy hat, were adopted as recognized symbols of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, founded in 1961 by Carlos Fonseca and Tomás Borge, among others, and later led by Daniel Ortega.

Sandino has been idolized by notable Latin American figures including Che Guevara, Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez. His brand of guerrilla warfare was effectively used by Castro, FARC in Colombia, the Sandinistas, and the FMLN in El Salvador.

In 1979 Somoza&#x27;s son, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, was overthrown by the Sandinistas, political descendants of Sandino. In the 1980s, they renamed Managua International Airport after him as &quot;Augusto C. Sandino International Airport.&quot; Pro-Somoza President Arnoldo Alemán renamed it Managua International Airport in 2001 after coming to power.

In 2007, President Daniel Ortega renamed again the airport in honor of Sandino. Nicaraguan artist Róger Pérez de la Rocha has created many portraits of Sandino—whose image was banned by the Somoza dictatorship—and of his associates, adding to the country&#x27;s iconography.

The Chilean-Spanish biopic &quot;Sandino&quot; (1990), directed by Miguel Littin, was filmed in Nicaragua with an international cast including Joaquim de Almeida as Sandino, Kris Kristofferson, Dean Stockwell, Victoria Abril and Ángela Molina.

==Quotes==
* In an address delivered on 1 July 1927 (now referred to as the &quot;San Albino Manifesto&quot;) to the people of Nicaragua and to the American armed forces stationed in Nicaragua at that time:Come, you pack of morphine addicts; come to kill us in our own land, and I will await you standing strong at the head of my patriotic soldiers, not caring about how many of you there are; bear in mind that when this happens, the destruction of your greatness will shake the Capitol in Washington, with your blood reddening the white sphere crowning your famous White House, the cavern where you plot your crimes.

<text>Telehaptic is the term for computer generated tactile (tangible or touch) sensations (haptics) over a network, between physically distant human beings, or between a local user and a remote location, using sensors and effectors. Microcontrollers input information from sensors, and control effectors to create human sensations as outputs. 

Sensors range from pressure, temperature and kinesthetic sensing devices, to biofeedback equipment. Haptic effectors, evoking precise perceivable sensations, range from small motors, fans, heating elements, or vibrators; to micro-voltage electrodes which gently stimulate areas of the skin (creating subtle, localized, &quot;tingling&quot; electrotactile sensations). Telehaptic interactivity, a form of assistive technology, may involve synesthesia; e.g. sensed inputs such as breathing, brain activity, or heartbeats might be presented as gentle, precisely variable bodily sensations in any combination, including warmth, cold, vibration, pressure, etc.; opening possibilities for levels of awareness, and interpersonal communication, difficult (or impossible) to attain prior to telehaptic (and biofeedback) technologies.

One of the challenges entailed in telehaptic applications involves the requirement for stability and the synchronized functioning of multiple tasks in order to effectively operate in a real-time environment.

== Applications ==
Interaction using telehaptic technology offers a new approach to communication including interpersonal interaction. It can be deployed to carry out telehealth encounters and the so-called telerehabilitation. Since the technology provides sensed inputs such as brain activity, heartbeats, and breathing, it creates an effective telehealth encounter that can enable real-time examination by a health professional. Telehaptic interactivity is now being integrated in therapy such as in sampling the position of body parts and the provision of resistive forces using telehaptic virtual gloves. Once challenges involving the irregularities of the communication network, delay, jitter, and packet loss, among others are addressed, telesurgery is also expected to advance.

Telehaptic systems are also useful in different handling applications. There are researcher, for instance, who are able to utilize its interfaces to perform actions such as pushing or more complicated tasks that require dexterity like grasping micro-objects. That is why, while the technology has not been perfected yet, scientists are optimistic about its potential. It means that telehaptic applications could play an important role in the future of microassembly and biological applications (e.g. handling cells and tissues). The concept of teleoperation, which involves the remote operation of a machine, demonstrates the potential of telehaptic technology application in the case of risky activities and tasks such as nuclear waste disposal and wreckage exploration.

<text>In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs mechanism is essential to explain the generation mechanism of the property &quot;mass&quot; for gauge bosons. Without the Higgs mechanism, all bosons (one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions) would be considered massless, but measurements show that the W+, W−, and Z0 bosons actually have relatively large masses of around 80 GeV/&quot;c&quot;2. The Higgs field resolves this conundrum. The simplest description of the mechanism adds to the Standard Model a quantum field (the Higgs field), which permeates all of space. Below some extremely high temperature, the field causes spontaneous symmetry breaking during interactions. The breaking of symmetry triggers the Higgs mechanism, causing the bosons with which it interacts to have mass. In the Standard Model, the phrase &quot;Higgs mechanism&quot; refers specifically to the generation of masses for the W±, and Z weak gauge bosons through electroweak symmetry breaking. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced results consistent with the Higgs particle on 14 March 2013, making it extremely likely that the field, or one like it, exists, and explaining how the Higgs mechanism takes place in nature.

The view of the Higgs mechanism as involving spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge symmetry is technically incorrect since by Elitzur&#x27;s theorem gauge symmetries can never be spontaneously broken. Rather, the Fröhlich–Morchio–Strocchi mechanism reformulates the Higgs mechanism in an entirely gauge invariant way, generally leading to the same results.

The mechanism was proposed in 1962 by Philip Warren Anderson, following work in the late 1950s on symmetry breaking in superconductivity and a 1960 paper by Yoichiro Nambu that discussed its application within particle physics.

A theory able to finally explain mass generation without &quot;breaking&quot; gauge theory was published almost simultaneously by three independent groups in 1964: by Robert Brout and François Englert; by Peter Higgs; and by Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble. The Higgs mechanism is therefore also called the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism, or Englert–Brout–Higgs–Guralnik–Hagen–Kibble mechanism, Anderson–Higgs mechanism, Anderson–Higgs–Kibble mechanism, Higgs–Kibble mechanism by Abdus Salam and ABEGHHK&#x27;tH mechanism (for Anderson, Brout, Englert, Guralnik, Hagen, Higgs, Kibble, and &#x27;t Hooft) by Peter Higgs. The Higgs mechanism in electrodynamics was also discovered independently by Eberly and Reiss in reverse as the &quot;gauge&quot; Dirac field mass gain due to the artificially displaced electromagnetic field as a Higgs field.

On 8 October 2013, following the discovery at CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider of a new particle that appeared to be the long-sought Higgs boson predicted by the theory, it was announced that Peter Higgs and François Englert had been awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Standard Model ==
The Higgs mechanism was incorporated into modern particle physics by Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam, and is an essential part of the Standard Model.

In the Standard Model, at temperatures high enough that electroweak symmetry is unbroken, all elementary particles are massless. At a critical temperature, the Higgs field develops a vacuum expectation value; some theories suggest the symmetry is spontaneously broken by tachyon condensation, and the W and Z bosons acquire masses (also called &quot;electroweak symmetry breaking&quot;, or &quot;EWSB&quot;). In the history of the universe, this is believed to have happened about a picosecond after the hot big bang, when the universe was at a temperature 159.5 ± 1.5 GeV.

Fermions, such as the leptons and quarks in the Standard Model, can also acquire mass as a result of their interaction with the Higgs field, but not in the same way as the gauge bosons.

=== Structure of the Higgs field ===
In the standard model, the Higgs field is an SU(2) doublet (i.e. the standard representation with two complex components called isospin), which is a scalar under Lorentz transformations. Its electric charge is zero; its weak isospin is and the third component of weak isospin is −; and its weak hypercharge (the charge for the U(1) gauge group defined up to an arbitrary multiplicative constant) is 1. Under U(1) rotations, it is multiplied by a phase, which thus mixes the real and imaginary parts of the complex spinor into each other, combining to the standard two-component complex representation of the group U(2).

The Higgs field, through the interactions specified (summarized, represented, or even simulated) by its potential, induces spontaneous breaking of three out of the four generators (&quot;directions&quot;) of the gauge group U(2). This is often written as SU(2)L × U(1)Y, (which is strictly speaking only the same on the level of infinitesimal symmetries) because the diagonal phase factor also acts on other fields – quarks in particular. Three out of its four components would ordinarily resolve as Goldstone bosons, if they were not coupled to gauge fields.

However, after symmetry breaking, these three of the four degrees of freedom in the Higgs field mix with the three W and Z bosons (, and ), and are only observable as components of these weak bosons, which are made massive by their inclusion; only the single remaining degree of freedom becomes a new scalar particle: the Higgs boson. The components that do not mix with Goldstone bosons form a massless photon.

=== The photon as the part that remains massless ===
The gauge group of the electroweak part of the standard model is SU(2)L × U(1)Y. The group SU(2) is the group of all 2-by-2 unitary matrices with unit determinant; all the orthonormal changes of coordinates in a complex two dimensional vector space.

Rotating the coordinates so that the second basis vector points in the direction of the Higgs boson makes the vacuum expectation value of &quot;H&quot; the spinor The generators for rotations about the x, y, and z axes are by half the Pauli matrices , , and , so that a rotation of angle about the z-axis takes the vacuum to
: formula_1

While the and generators mix up the top and bottom components of the spinor, the rotations only multiply each by opposite phases. This phase can be undone by a U(1) rotation of angle Consequently, under both an SU(2) -rotation and a U(1) rotation by an amount the vacuum is invariant.

This combination of generators
: formula_2
defines the unbroken part of the gauge group, where is the electric charge, is the generator of rotations around the 3-axis in the adjoint representation of SU(2) and is the weak hypercharge generator of the U(1). This combination of generators (a &quot;3&quot; rotation in the SU(2) and a simultaneous U(1) rotation by half the angle) preserves the vacuum, and defines the unbroken gauge group in the standard model, namely the electric charge group. The part of the gauge field in this direction stays massless, and amounts to the physical photon.
By contrast, the broken trace-orthogonal charge formula_3 couples to the massive  boson.

=== Consequences for fermions ===
In spite of the introduction of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the mass terms preclude chiral gauge invariance. For these fields, the mass terms should always be replaced by a gauge-invariant &quot;Higgs&quot; mechanism. One possibility is some kind of Yukawa coupling (see below) between the fermion field and the Higgs field , with unknown couplings , which after symmetry breaking (more precisely: after expansion of the Lagrange density around a suitable ground state) again results in the original mass terms, which are now, however (i.e., by introduction of the Higgs field) written in a gauge-invariant way. The Lagrange density for the Yukawa interaction of a fermion field and the Higgs field is

:formula_4

where again the gauge field only enters via the gauge covariant derivative operator (i.e., it is only indirectly visible). The quantities are the Dirac matrices, and is the already-mentioned Yukawa coupling parameter for . Now the mass-generation follows the same principle as above, namely from the existence of a finite expectation value formula_5 Again, this is crucial for the existence of the property &quot;mass&quot;.

== History of research ==

=== Background ===
Spontaneous symmetry breaking offered a framework to introduce bosons into relativistic quantum field theories. However, according to Goldstone&#x27;s theorem, these bosons should be massless. The only observed particles which could be approximately interpreted as Goldstone bosons were the pions, which Yoichiro Nambu related to chiral symmetry breaking.

A similar problem arises with Yang–Mills theory (also known as non-abelian gauge theory), which predicts massless spin-1 gauge bosons. Massless weakly-interacting gauge bosons lead to long-range forces, which are only observed for electromagnetism and the corresponding massless photon. Gauge theories of the weak force needed a way to describe massive gauge bosons in order to be consistent.

=== Discovery ===


That breaking gauge symmetries did not lead to massless particles was observed in 1961 by Julian Schwinger, but he did not demonstrate massive particles would eventuate. This was done in Philip Warren Anderson&#x27;s 1962 paper but only in non-relativistic field theory; it also discussed consequences for particle physics but did not work out an explicit relativistic model. The relativistic model was developed in 1964 by three independent groups:
* Robert Brout and François Englert
* Peter Higgs
* Gerald Guralnik, Carl Richard Hagen, and Tom Kibble.
Slightly later, in 1965, but independently from the other publications the mechanism was also proposed by Alexander Migdal and Alexander Polyakov, at that time Soviet undergraduate students. However, their paper was delayed by the editorial office of JETP, and was published late, in 1966.

The mechanism is closely analogous to phenomena previously discovered by Yoichiro Nambu involving the &quot;vacuum structure&quot; of quantum fields in superconductivity. A similar but distinct effect (involving an affine realization of what is now recognized as the Higgs field), known as the Stueckelberg mechanism, had previously been studied by Ernst Stueckelberg.

These physicists discovered that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry group, the gauge bosons can consistently acquire a nonzero mass. In spite of the large values involved (see below) this permits a gauge theory description of the weak force, which was independently developed by Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam in 1967. Higgs&#x27;s original article presenting the model was rejected by &quot;Physics Letters&quot;. When revising the article before resubmitting it to &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, he added a sentence at the end, mentioning that it implies the existence of one or more new, massive scalar bosons, which do not form complete representations of the symmetry group; these are the Higgs bosons.

The three papers by Brout and Englert; Higgs; and Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble were each recognized as &quot;milestone letters&quot; by &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; in 2008. While each of these seminal papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences among the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers are noteworthy. All six physicists were jointly awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work.

Benjamin W. Lee is often credited with first naming the &quot;Higgs-like&quot; mechanism, although there is debate around when this first occurred. One of the first times the &quot;Higgs&quot; name appeared in print was in 1972 when Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman referred to it as the &quot;Higgs–Kibble mechanism&quot; in their Nobel winning paper.

===Simple explanation of the theory, from its origins in superconductivity===
The proposed Higgs mechanism arose as a result of theories proposed to explain observations in superconductivity. A superconductor does not allow penetration by external magnetic fields (the Meissner effect). This strange observation implies that the electromagnetic field somehow becomes short ranged during this phenomenon. Successful theories arose to explain this during the 1950s, first for fermions (Ginzburg–Landau theory, 1950), and then for bosons (BCS theory, 1957).

In these theories, superconductivity is interpreted as arising from a charged condensate. Initially, the condensate value does not have any preferred direction. This implies it is scalar, but its phase is capable of defining a gauge, in gauge based field theories. To do this, the field must be charged. A charged scalar field must also be complex (or described another way, it contains at least two components, and a symmetry capable of rotating each into the other(s)). In naïve gauge theory, a gauge transformation of a condensate usually rotates the phase. However, in these circumstances, it instead fixes a preferred choice of phase. However it turns out that fixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere, also causes the electromagnetic field to gain an extra term. This extra term causes the electromagnetic field to become short range.

Goldstone&#x27;s theorem also plays a role in such theories. The connection is technically, when a condensate breaks a symmetry, then the state reached by acting with a symmetry generator on the condensate has the same energy as before. This means that some kinds of oscillation will not involve change of energy. Oscillations with unchanged energy imply that excitations (particles) associated with the oscillation are massless.

Once attention was drawn to this theory within particle physics, the parallels were clear. A change of the usually long range electromagnetic field to become short ranged, within a gauge invariant theory, was exactly the needed effect sought for the weak force bosons (because a long range force has massless gauge bosons, and a short ranged force implies massive gauge bosons, suggesting that a result of this interaction is that the field&#x27;s gauge bosons acquired mass, or a similar and equivalent effect). The features of a field required to do this was also quite well defined – it would have to be a charged scalar field, with at least two components, and complex in order to support a symmetry able to rotate these into each other.

== Examples ==
The Higgs mechanism occurs whenever a charged field has a vacuum expectation value. In the non-relativistic context this is a superconductor, more formally known as the Landau model of a charged Bose–Einstein condensate. In the relativistic condensate, the condensate is a scalar field that is relativistically invariant.

=== Landau model ===
The Higgs mechanism is a type of superconductivity which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged, or, in field language, when a charged field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the quantum fluid filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does inside a superconductor; e.g., in the Ginzburg–Landau theory).

A superconductor expels all magnetic fields from its interior, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. This was mysterious for a long time, because it implies that electromagnetic forces somehow become short-range inside the superconductor. Contrast this with the behavior of an ordinary metal. In a metal, the conductivity shields electric fields by rearranging charges on the surface until the total field cancels in the interior.

But magnetic fields can penetrate to any distance, and if a magnetic monopole (an isolated magnetic pole) is surrounded by a metal the field can escape without collimating into a string. In a superconductor, however, electric charges move with no dissipation, and this allows for permanent surface currents, not just surface charges. When magnetic fields are introduced at the boundary of a superconductor, they produce surface currents which exactly neutralize them.

The Meissner effect arises due to currents in a thin surface layer, whose thickness can be calculated from the simple model of Ginzburg–Landau theory, which treats superconductivity as a charged Bose–Einstein condensate.

Suppose that a superconductor contains bosons with charge  . The wavefunction of the bosons can be described by introducing a quantum field, formula_6 which obeys the Schrödinger equation as a field equation. In units where the reduced Planck constant, , is set to 1:

:formula_7

The operator formula_8 annihilates a boson at the point , while its adjoint formula_9 creates a new boson at the same point. The wavefunction of the Bose–Einstein condensate is then the expectation value formula_10 of formula_11 which is a classical function that obeys the same equation. The interpretation of the expectation value is that it is the phase that one should give to a newly created boson so that it will coherently superpose with all the other bosons already in the condensate.

When there is a charged condensate, the electromagnetic interactions are screened. To see this, consider the effect of a gauge transformation on the field. A gauge transformation rotates the phase of the condensate by an amount which changes from point to point, and shifts the vector potential by a gradient:

:formula_12

When there is no condensate, this transformation only changes the definition of the phase of formula_13 at every point. But when there is a condensate, the phase of the condensate defines a preferred choice of phase.

The condensate wave function can be written as

:formula_14

where is real amplitude, which determines the local density of the condensate. If the condensate were neutral, the flow would be along the gradients of , the direction in which the phase of the Schrödinger field changes. If the phase changes slowly, the flow is slow and has very little energy. But now can be made equal to zero just by making a gauge transformation to rotate the phase of the field.

The energy of slow changes of phase can be calculated from the Schrödinger kinetic energy,

:formula_15

and taking the density of the condensate to be constant,

:formula_16

Fixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere, the electromagnetic field energy has an extra term,

:formula_17

When this term is present, electromagnetic interactions become short-ranged. Every field mode, no matter how long the wavelength, oscillates with a nonzero frequency. The lowest frequency can be read off from the energy of a long wavelength mode,

:formula_18

This is a harmonic oscillator with frequency

:formula_19

The quantity formula_20 is the density of the condensate of superconducting particles.

In an actual superconductor, the charged particles are electrons, which are fermions not bosons. So in order to have superconductivity, the electrons need to somehow bind into Cooper pairs. The charge of the condensate is therefore twice the electron charge . The pairing in a normal superconductor is due to lattice vibrations, and is in fact very weak; this means that the pairs are very loosely bound. The description of a Bose–Einstein condensate of loosely bound pairs is actually more difficult than the description of a condensate of elementary particles, and was only worked out in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer in the famous BCS theory.

=== Abelian Higgs mechanism ===
Gauge invariance means that certain transformations of the gauge field do not change the energy at all. If an arbitrary gradient is added to , the energy of the field is exactly the same. This makes it difficult to add a mass term, because a mass term tends to push the field toward the value zero. But the zero value of the vector potential is not a gauge invariant idea. What is zero in one gauge is nonzero in another.

So in order to give mass to a gauge theory, the gauge invariance must be broken by a condensate. The condensate will then define a preferred phase, and the phase of the condensate will define the zero value of the field in a gauge-invariant way. The gauge-invariant definition is that a gauge field is zero when the phase change along any path from parallel transport is equal to the phase difference in the condensate wavefunction.

The condensate value is described by a quantum field with an expectation value, just as in the Ginzburg–Landau model.

In order for the phase of the vacuum to define a gauge, the field must have a phase (also referred to as &#x27;to be charged&#x27;). In order for a scalar field to have a phase, it must be complex, or (equivalently) it should contain two fields with a symmetry which rotates them into each other. The vector potential changes the phase of the quanta produced by the field when they move from point to point. In terms of fields, it defines how much to rotate the real and imaginary parts of the fields into each other when comparing field values at nearby points.

The only renormalizable model where a complex scalar field acquires a nonzero value is the &#x27;Mexican-hat&#x27; model, where the field energy has a minimum away from zero. The action for this model is
:formula_21
which results in the Hamiltonian
:formula_22
The first term is the kinetic energy of the field. The second term is the extra potential energy when the field varies from point to point. The third term is the potential energy when the field has any given magnitude.

This potential energy, the Higgs potential, formula_23 has a graph which looks like a Mexican hat, which gives the model its name. In particular, the minimum energy value is not at but on the circle of points where the magnitude of 

When the field is not coupled to electromagnetism, the Mexican-hat potential has flat directions. Starting in any one of the circle of vacua and changing the phase of the field from point to point costs very little energy. Mathematically, if
:formula_24
with a constant prefactor, then the action for the field i.e., the &quot;phase&quot; of the Higgs field has only derivative terms. This is not a surprise: Adding a constant to is a symmetry of the original theory, so different values of cannot have different energies. This is an example of configuring the model to conform to Goldstone&#x27;s theorem: Spontaneously broken continuous symmetries (normally) produce massless excitations.

The Abelian Higgs model is the Mexican-hat model coupled to electromagnetism:
:formula_25


The classical vacuum is again at the minimum of the potential, where the magnitude of the complex field is equal But now the phase of the field is arbitrary, because gauge transformations change it. This means that the field formula_26 can be set to zero by a gauge transformation, and does not represent any actual degrees of freedom at all.

Furthermore, choosing a gauge where the phase of the vacuum is fixed, the potential energy for fluctuations of the vector field is nonzero. So in the Abelian Higgs model, the gauge field acquires a mass. To calculate the magnitude of the mass, consider a constant value of the vector potential in the -direction in the gauge where the condensate has constant phase. This is the same as a sinusoidally varying condensate in the gauge where the vector potential is zero. In the gauge where A is zero, the potential energy density in the condensate is the scalar gradient energy:
:formula_27
This energy is the same as a mass term where 

==== Mathematical details of the abelian Higgs mechanism ====

=== Non-Abelian Higgs mechanism ===
The Non-Abelian Higgs model has the following action

:formula_28

where now the non-Abelian field A is contained in the covariant derivative &quot;D&quot; and in the tensor components formula_29 and formula_30 (the relation between A and those components is well-known from the Yang–Mills theory).

It is exactly analogous to the Abelian Higgs model. Now the field formula_31 is in a representation of the gauge group, and the gauge covariant derivative is defined by the rate of change of the field minus the rate of change from parallel transport using the gauge field A as a connection.

:formula_32

Again, the expectation value of formula_31 defines a preferred gauge where the vacuum is constant, and fixing this gauge, fluctuations in the gauge field &quot;A&quot; come with a nonzero energy cost.

Depending on the representation of the scalar field, not every gauge field acquires a mass. A simple example is in the renormalizable version of an early electroweak model due to Julian Schwinger. In this model, the gauge group is SO(3) (or SU(2) − there are no spinor representations in the model), and the gauge invariance is broken down to U(1) or SO(2) at long distances. To make a consistent renormalizable version using the Higgs mechanism, introduce a scalar field formula_34 which transforms as a vector (a triplet) of SO(3). If this field has a vacuum expectation value, it points in some direction in field space. Without loss of generality, one can choose the &quot;z&quot;-axis in field space to be the direction that formula_31 is pointing, and then the vacuum expectation value of formula_31 is , where is a constant with dimensions of mass (formula_37).

Rotations around the &quot;z&quot;-axis form a U(1) subgroup of SO(3) which preserves the vacuum expectation value of formula_31, and this is the unbroken gauge group. Rotations around the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;-axis do not preserve the vacuum, and the components of the SO(3) gauge field which generate these rotations become massive vector mesons. There are two massive W mesons in the Schwinger model, with a mass set by the mass scale , and one massless U(1) gauge boson, similar to the photon.

The Schwinger model predicts magnetic monopoles at the electroweak unification scale, and does not predict the Z boson. It doesn&#x27;t break electroweak symmetry properly as in nature. But historically, a model similar to this (but not using the Higgs mechanism) was the first in which the weak force and the electromagnetic force were unified.

=== Affine Higgs mechanism ===
Ernst Stueckelberg discovered a version of the Higgs mechanism by analyzing the theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon. Effectively, Stueckelberg&#x27;s model is a limit of the regular Mexican hat Abelian Higgs model, where the vacuum expectation value goes to infinity and the charge of the Higgs field goes to zero in such a way that their product stays fixed. The mass of the Higgs boson is proportional to , so the Higgs boson becomes infinitely massive and decouples, so is not present in the discussion. The vector meson mass, however, is equal to the product , and stays finite.

The interpretation is that when a U(1) gauge field does not require quantized charges, it is possible to keep only the angular part of the Higgs oscillations, and discard the radial part. The angular part of the Higgs field has the following gauge transformation law:
:formula_39

The gauge covariant derivative for the angle (which is actually gauge invariant) is:
:formula_40

In order to keep fluctuations finite and nonzero in this limit, should be rescaled so that its kinetic term in the action stays normalized. The action for the theta field is read off from the Mexican hat action by substituting formula_41

:formula_42

since is the gauge boson mass. By making a gauge transformation to set the gauge freedom in the action is eliminated, and the action becomes that of a massive vector field:

:formula_43

To have arbitrarily small charges requires that the U(1) is not the circle of unit complex numbers under multiplication, but the real numbers under addition, which is only different in the global topology. Such a U(1) group is non-compact. The field transforms as an affine representation of the gauge group. Among the allowed gauge groups, only non-compact U(1) admits affine representations, and the U(1) of electromagnetism is experimentally known to be compact, since charge quantization holds to extremely high accuracy.

The Higgs condensate in this model has infinitesimal charge, so interactions with the Higgs boson do not violate charge conservation. The theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is still a renormalizable theory, one in which electric charge is still conserved, but magnetic monopoles are not allowed. For non-Abelian gauge theory, there is no affine limit, and the Higgs oscillations cannot be too much more massive than the vectors.

<text>Chauncey Ray Billups (born September 25, 1976) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After playing college basketball with the Colorado Buffaloes, he was selected third overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. Billups spent the majority of his 17-year basketball career playing for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), where he won the NBA Finals MVP in 2004 after helping the Pistons beat the Los Angeles Lakers in the Finals. He was given the nickname &quot;Mr. Big Shot&quot; for making late-game shots with Detroit. A five-time NBA All-Star, a three-time All-NBA selection and two-time NBA All-Defensive selection, Billups also played for the Celtics, Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, New York Knicks, and Los Angeles Clippers during his NBA career.

Billups worked as a studio analyst after his retiring from playing in 2014. The Pistons retired his No. 1 jersey in 2016. He started coaching as an assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers during the 2020–21 season. Billups was appointed as head coach of the Trail Blazers in 2021. In 2024, it was announced that Billups would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==High school career==
Born in Denver, Colorado, Billups graduated from George Washington High School in 1995. At George Washington, he was a four-time All-State first team pick, Colorado Mr. Basketball three times, and Colorado Player of the Year as a sophomore and as a junior. He started on varsity as a freshman. He was selected to the 1995 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Team but did not play due to a shoulder injury.

==College career==
For college, Billups chose the University of Colorado Boulder over Kansas, Georgia Tech, University of California-Berkeley, and Oklahoma State. He averaged 18.5 points, 5.1 assists, and 5.6 rebounds per game over his two seasons with the Buffaloes. In the 1996–97 season, he was named to the All-Big 12 Conference First Team, the Basketball Times All-American First Team, and Consensus 2nd team All-American. That same season, Colorado finished second in the Big 12 conference with an overall record of 22–10. Billups then led the Buffaloes to their first NCAA tournament appearance in 28 years. As a 9-seed, Billups and the Buffalos upset the 8-seed Indiana Hoosiers 80–62 but then lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels 56–73. Billups averaged 17.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game.

===College awards and honors===
* Consensus second-team All-American (1997)
* All-Big 12 First Team (1997)
* AllBuffs.com All-Time Colorado Buffaloes Men&#x27;s Basketball Team
* No. 4 retired by University of Colorado

==Professional career==

===Boston Celtics (1997–1998)===
Billups was drafted third overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. He did not mesh with new Celtics head coach Rick Pitino. In his first career game, Billups recorded 15 points, 2 rebounds and 4 assists in 16 minutes of playing time as a reserve in a win against the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. In his eighth career game, Billups posted a then career-high 22 points, on 5-for-14 shooting from the field and 9-for-10 from the free throw line, to go along with 3 assists and 4 steals, in a 103–99 win over the visiting Raptors. Years later, Billups reflected on his stint in Boston, commenting, &quot;That didn&#x27;t help. That didn&#x27;t give me a chance to really slow down and listen to myself, listen to the game and what&#x27;s going on. I never really had that chance. It was a recipe for disaster there.&quot; In addition, the Celtics coaching staff did not know whether to play him as a point guard or shooting guard. Fifty-one games later, Billups was traded to the Toronto Raptors on the trade deadline.

===Toronto Raptors (1998-1999)===
On February 18, 1998, Billups was traded to the Toronto Raptors, along with Roy Rogers, Dee Brown, and John Thomas in exchange for All-Star point guard Kenny Anderson, Žan Tabak, and Popeye Jones. On February 22, in just his second career game with the Raptors, Billups recorded a then-career high of 27 points on 5-for-13 shooting from the field and 13-for-16 from the free throw line, to go along with 2 rebounds and 5 assists in a 113–105 win over the Vancouver Grizzlies. On March 3, Billups recorded 26 points to go along with 5 rebounds and 6 assists in a 93–108 loss to the visiting Utah Jazz. On April 14, Billups recorded 19 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists in a 96–92 road win over the New Jersey Nets.

===Denver Nuggets (1999–2000)===
On January 21, 1999, Billups was dealt to his hometown Denver Nuggets in a three-way deal involving one of Billups&#x27;s future teams, the Minnesota Timberwolves. Minnesota received Dean Garrett and Bobby Jackson from Denver, Toronto received future teammate Željko Rebrača and Micheal Williams from Minnesota and the 5th pick in the 1999 NBA draft from Denver, and Billups, along with Tyson Wheeler, were sent to Denver from Toronto. Three months into his first tenure with the Nuggets, Billups visited a local Denver hospital in order to comfort and inspire Patrick Ireland, a victim of the 1999 Columbine High School Shooting Massacre. A year later, on February 1, 2000, Billups was traded to the Orlando Magic along with Ron Mercer and Johnny Taylor in exchange for Chris Gatling, Tariq Abdul-Wahad, a future first-round pick, and cash.

Billups was on the injured list until season&#x27;s end due to an injured shoulder and never played a game for the Magic. Despite this, he was included in the season-ending team photo. Among NBA circles, Billups was considered a draft bust.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (2000–2002)===
Billups was signed by the Minnesota Timberwolves (who had been involved in the trade that sent Billups to Denver) as a back-up to then point guard Terrell Brandon, who would mentor the troubled player alongside Sam Mitchell, Wally Szczerbiak, and Kevin Garnett. Billups would work with his more experienced teammates on shooting, scouting, decision-making and the other attributes that came with playing point guard in the NBA, such as learning to work more effectively with teammates and deciding which plays would be most beneficial for the team in a specific situation.

In his first career game with the Timberwolves, Billups recorded 15 points, 2 rebounds and 5 assists in a 106–98 road win over the Houston Rockets. On November 11, 2000, Billups recorded his season-high in terms of points scored with 31 points to go along with 5 rebounds and 9 assists in a 103–92 road win over the Bucks.

During the 2001–02 season, Brandon suffered a serious knee injury. Billups replaced him and had a breakthrough 2001–02 season. The Timberwolves won 50 games before they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs, with Billups averaging 22 points per game in the series.

===Detroit Pistons (2002–2008)===

==== First year in Detroit (2002–2003) ====

After his breakthrough season, Billups became a free agent. Billups wanted to return to the Timberwolves, but the team wanted to see how Brandon would respond to his knee injury.

In June 2002, Billups signed a 5-year, $35 million contract with the Detroit Pistons to be the team&#x27;s new starting point guard. When he signed with the Pistons, he was forced to take the number 1 because number 4 was retired in honor of Joe Dumars. Billups quickly earned respect from Pistons fans and colleagues for his tenacious defense and clutch shooting.

In 2002–03, Billups helped Detroit finish first overall in the Eastern Conference with a 50–32 regular season record. Billups earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Big-Shot&quot; during the regular season for two events. He first made a game winning three on March 9 as time expired to beat the Golden State Warriors 107–105 and Billups scored 31 points. The second event was just over two weeks later on March 26. The Pistons were tied in overtime with the Atlanta Hawks 99–99 until Billups made a top-of-the-key triple with 0.5 seconds left to win the game. Billups finished with 22 points against the Hawks. In the 2003 Playoffs, the top-seed Pistons surprisingly fell behind the upstart 8-seed Orlando Magic in the first round series 3 games to 1. In game 5, Billups played a contributing role in his team&#x27;s dominating 98–67 victory by scoring 15 points, tied for second on the Pistons. Having helped the Pistons stave off elimination in Game 5, Billups scored 40 points in game 6 to help the Pistons force a seventh game. In the decisive Game 7, Billups scored 37 points to help clinch the series 4–3.

Detroit then beat the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, 4–2, to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. However, Detroit would be swept by the New Jersey Nets, 4–0. Rick Carlisle was fired as the head coach in the offseason and Larry Brown was hired.

==== Championship season and Finals MVP (2003–2004) ====
In the 2004 season, Billups averaged 16.9 points, 5.7 assists, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.1 steals per game. The Pistons improved their record to 54–28, but it was only good for the third seed overall in the Eastern Conference playoff standings.
In the pivotal Game 3 during the first round series against the Milwaukee Bucks, which was tied 1–1, Billups led all scorers with 21 points and finished the scoring for his team by sinking 4 of 4 free throws in the final 31.2 seconds. These free throws were a key part of the Pistons effort to stave off the Bucks&#x27; relentless defense which kept Detroit from scoring a normal field goal during the last 5:34. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals versus the defending Eastern Conference Champions the New Jersey Nets, Billups banked in a half-court three as time expired in game 5 to send the game into overtime. The Pistons would lose in triple overtime. Finally, he helped Detroit overcome a 3–2 series deficit to win the series, 4–3.

In the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, the Pistons won the gritty, defensive series, 4–2, by an average score of 75.2 PPG to the Pacers&#x27; 72.7 PPG.

Billups helped Detroit win the 2004 NBA Finals over the heavily favored Los Angeles Lakers, 4–1. He averaged per game 21 points, 5.2 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 1.2 steals, as well as shooting 50.1 percent field goals, 47.1 percent three-pointers, and 92.9 percent free throws to earn the NBA Finals MVP Award. Billups said of his MVP award, &quot;Everybody deserves this. Not just me. I wish I could turn it into thirteen pieces and give a little bit to everybody.&quot;

==== Back-to-back All-Defensive honors (2004–2006) ====
The following season, Billups was named to the 2005 NBA Second All-Defensive Team, along with teammate Tayshaun Prince, while teammate and co-captain of the Pistons Ben Wallace took home the Defensive Player of the Year Award. The Pistons reached the 2005 NBA Finals but lost in their bid to repeat as champions to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games.

In 2006, Billups was co-captain of the team. Billups was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve for the Eastern Conference, along with teammates Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace and Ben Wallace. Pistons head coach Flip Saunders coached the Eastern Conference squad and put all four Pistons in the game when the east was falling behind; they were able to get the Eastern All-Star team back in the game. During the 2006 NBA All-Star Weekend, Billups participated in the Three-point Shootout contest. He was eliminated in the first round of the contest after scoring 12 points. Billups called this moment when all four Pistons entered the game at the same time, one of the highlight moments of his career. Although he captained the Pistons to a franchise best 64–18 record, they failed to make it to the NBA Finals for the first time in three years.

==== Final seasons in Detroit (2006–2008) ====
In the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, Billups was chosen as a reserve, along with teammate Richard Hamilton, for the Eastern Conference, despite an injury that kept Billups out of five games early on in the season. Billups also took part in the Shooting Stars Competition alongside former Piston and Detroit Shock head coach Bill Laimbeer and Shock star Swin Cash. Team Detroit won the competition with Billups hitting the final half-court shot.

On July 11, 2007, Billups signed a $46 million, four-year contract with the Pistons (which includes a team option for a fifth year at $14 million). He had been an unrestricted free agent for several days after he opted out of the previous contract, which he had signed in 2002. Billups was selected to play as a reserve in the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, along with teammates Richard Hamilton and Rasheed Wallace, an injury replacement.

In the first round of the 2008 NBA playoffs, during Game 3 against the Orlando Magic, Billups injured his right hamstring when Orlando Magic guard Jameer Nelson tangled with Billup&#x27;s left leg on a drive to the bucket. Billups would sit for the 3 remaining games of the series. Billups and the Pistons again made it to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Celtics, but lost the series, 4–2, to the eventual champions.

===Return to Denver (2008–2011)===

On November 3, 2008, Billups was traded back to his hometown team the Denver Nuggets along with Antonio McDyess and Cheikh Samb for Allen Iverson. Pistons GM Joe Dumars said that it was &quot;the hardest and toughest&quot; move he had made as a general manager, describing Billups as &quot;... a guy that I have looked at as a little brother.&quot;

Billups chose the #7 jersey to honor Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, since two of his other favorite numbers, 1 and 4, were already worn by J. R. Smith and Kenyon Martin, respectively. He played his first game of the Nuggets&#x27; 2008–09 season on November 7, 2008. He recorded 15 points, four rebounds and three assists in 30 minutes of play in a 108–105 Nuggets&#x27; home win. Billups was the only Nugget to be selected to the 2009 NBA All-Star Game. He finished the season averaging 17.7 points and 6.4 assists per game.

With Billups and Carmelo Anthony, the Nuggets accomplished a number of franchise milestones. Their 54–28 record matched a franchise record, and their 27–14 start was also a franchise record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise&#x27;s history the team had gotten 50 wins in back-to-back seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and gaining the number two seed in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team had ever been seeded for the playoffs. In the first round, they defeated the New Orleans Hornets in 5 games, which included a record-equaling 58-point margin-of-victory. Billups also set a Nuggets franchise record with the most three-pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 three-pointers in total is a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series. In his first year with the Nuggets, Billups led them back to the NBA Conference Finals for the first time since 1985. They would play the Lakers for the second straight year (the Lakers had swept them in the first round the year before). The Nuggets would ultimately lose the series 4–2. This was Billups&#x27; 7th straight conference finals. He joined Magic Johnson, Michael Cooper, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Kurt Rambis as the only players to accomplish this feat since the Boston Celtics of the 1950s and 1960s led by Bill Russell. Billups finished the season sixth in voting for the 2009 NBA Most Valuable Player Award. He was also selected to his second All-NBA Third Team.

For the 2009–10 season, Billups reverted to wearing #1, the same number he wore with the Pistons. Teammate J. R. Smith, who had previously worn #1 since being acquired by the Nuggets in 2006, changed to the #5 jersey. On November 27, 2009, in the Nuggets&#x27; 128–125 win over the New York Knicks, Billups scored 32 points while teammate Carmelo Anthony scored 50. This made them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 30 and 50 points respectively. On February 5, 2010, Billups set a career high in points with a 39-point performance in a road win over the Los Angeles Lakers with 27 of them coming from 9 three-pointers. Billups was chosen as the replacement by David Stern for injured New Orleans Hornets point guard Chris Paul at the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. During the 2010–11 season, he averaged 16.5 points, 5.3 assists, and 2.5 rebounds in 32.3 minutes per game. His .441 three-point field goal percentage was a career high.

===New York Knicks (2011)===
Despite publicly professing his desire to finish his career in hometown Denver and retire as a member of the Nuggets, Billups was traded to the New York Knicks on February 22, 2011 as part of the Carmelo Anthony deal. Billups was &quot;collateral damage&quot;—as more than one sportswriter put it—of Carmelo Anthony&#x27;s desire to play in New York and the Nuggets&#x27; desire to trade Anthony before he became a free agent. &quot;Oh it was hard, hardest thing I&#x27;ve ever had to do&quot;, Billups said. &quot;I had to tell my girls that daddy was traded, that he was leaving to play across the country. I told them it wasn&#x27;t my choice, that nothing could be done about it. I had to go. It wasn&#x27;t a happy scene.&quot;

The Knicks finished 42–40 and clinched the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and made the playoffs for the first time since 2004. Billups suffered a knee injury while playing against the Celtics in Game 1 of the 2011 NBA Playoffs. The injury would keep Billups sidelined for the remainder of the playoffs.

Shortly after the Knicks were eliminated from the playoffs by the Boston Celtics, Billups mentioned he would love to return to the Knicks next season. &quot;I would love the opportunity to really try it up with these guys&quot;, Billups said. &quot;Not like play 30 games after a trade, like really have a season. Have an opportunity to really get a fair shake with these guys. I would love to.&quot; In December 2011, the Knicks used their amnesty clause on Billups and put him on waivers, ending his tenure with the Knicks.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2011–2013)===
After his tenure with the Knicks came to an end, Billups became an unrestricted free agent. Many believed that a contender like the Miami Heat or the Los Angeles Lakers would end up acquiring Billups. However, on December 12, 2011, the Los Angeles Clippers claimed Billups off waivers. Billups indicated that he didn&#x27;t want to be picked up by a team that was not contending for a championship and said he would retire if he was, pushing the NBA to warn him and his agent that he would be &quot;in breach of his contract&quot; if he did not show up. However, the Clippers ended up trading for the Hornets&#x27; superstar point guard Chris Paul two days later. After the Chris Paul trade, Billups said that he was happy to be with the Clippers, saying that &quot;I think these guys are ready to take the next leap and hopefully I can help with that.&quot;

Billups, a point guard, was moved into the shooting guard position, which he was still getting used to when he was injured. On February 7, 2012, an MRI revealed a tear in Billups&#x27;s Achilles tendon, ending his season after only 20 game appearances. Billups helped the Clippers beat Miami, Oklahoma City, Orlando, and the Los Angeles Lakers en route to a 19–9 start.

On July 13, 2012, Billups re-signed with the Clippers on a one-year deal. He made his season debut on November 28, 2012, against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was limited to only 22 games during the season because of various injuries, including a sore back and tendinitis in his left foot.

On June 10, 2013, Billups received the inaugural Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award. He was humbled by the award and said, &quot;For my name to be mentioned with [Jack Twyman], I really don&#x27;t feel worthy, to be honest with you. It&#x27;s kind of embarrassing.&quot; During the 2012–13 season, Billups averaged a new career high free-throw percentage. He became a free agent after the season.

===Return to Detroit (2013–2014)===
On July 16, 2013, Billups signed a two-year, $5 million contract to return to the Detroit Pistons. More knee problems caused him to miss most of the 2013–14 season, as he appeared in his fewest games since the 1999–2000 season and averaged career lows in points, minutes, steals, field goal percentage, and three-point percentage during the year. The Pistons finished the season at 29–53 and missed the postseason.

On June 30, 2014, the Pistons announced they would not pick up their team option on Billups&#x27; contract for the 2014–15 season.

On September 9, 2014, Billups announced his retirement from the NBA after 17 years. Billups cited his health as the main reason for his retirement, as he never appeared in more than 22 games in his last three seasons in the league.

On February 10, 2016, the Pistons retired Billups&#x27; No. 1 jersey.

==BIG3==
In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Billups set to be a player for the Killer 3&#x27;s.

==Coaching career==
=== Los Angeles Clippers (2020–2021) ===
On November 16, 2020, Billups was hired as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers under head coach Tyronn Lue.

=== Portland Trail Blazers (2021–present) ===
On June 27, 2021, Billups was hired as head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.

==National team career==

On March 5, 2006, Billups was selected to be a part of the 2006–2008 USA Men&#x27;s Senior National Team program developed to restore Team USA back to the top of the basketball world after disappointments in the 2002 FIBA World Championship and the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. After missing out in the 2006 FIBA World Championship for personal reasons, on August 20, 2007, Billups was selected to be a part of Team USA that competed at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, a qualifying tournament for the Beijing Olympics. Coming off the bench, he along with the other new members of the team including All Star Kobe Bryant helped USA go unbeaten at the tournament held in Las Vegas and earn a spot at next Summer Olympics. On June 17, 2008, Billups announced he would not compete for a spot to be on the Olympic squad stating family reasons though he did say &quot;they&#x27;ll be fine. And when they win the gold, I&#x27;ll feel like I had a big hand in regaining our dominance because of what we did last summer.&quot; During the tournament, Team USA went unbeaten on their way to their first gold medal since the 2000 Olympics, defeating Spain in the final.

==Television career==
Billups joined ESPN in the 2014–15 NBA season as a studio analyst on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and other programming. The following season, Billups joined &quot;NBA Countdown&quot; as a studio analyst on Wednesdays. In the ensuing three seasons, he began splitting time between the studio and working as a game analyst on selected telecasts. Finally, on August 16, 2019, Billups announced that he was exiting his role on &quot;NBA Countdown&quot; to become the game analyst on Los Angeles Clippers telecasts as part of that team&#x27;s restructuring of the broadcast crew due to the retirement of longtime play-by-play announcer Ralph Lawler. Billups indicated that he would also continue to call selected NBA game telecasts on ESPN in addition to his duties with the Clippers.

==Personal life==
Billups and his wife have three daughters. His younger brother, Rodney, played point guard for the University of Denver from 2002 to 2005, was drafted in the NBA Development League, played professionally in Europe, and went on to a coaching career, becoming head coach of the Denver Pioneers in 2016.

Billups is the first cousin of running back LenDale White. His second cousin Amir Billups of the Buffalo 716ers was killed in a 2015 car accident.

Billups wore the #4 through high school and college and at times during his professional career because he idolized former Pistons guard Joe Dumars, the Pistons&#x27; President of Basketball Operations during his time with Detroit. His favorite NFL team is the Denver Broncos.

Billups was featured on the cover of the video game &quot;NBA Ballers: Phenom&quot; and is the player&#x27;s mentor.

On June 16, 2008, Billups appeared at Joe Louis Arena for a Barack Obama rally.

The Coors Events Center has a large mural of Billups in the northeast corner of the arena as part of his &quot;Chauncey&#x27;s Kid Roundup&quot; program.

===Sexual assault allegation===
In 1997, Billups and fellow former Celtic Ron Mercer were accused of sexually assaulting a woman at the home of teammate Antoine Walker. According to a civil suit, Billups, Mercer and Walker&#x27;s roommate Michael Irvin assaulted the woman at Walker&#x27;s condo after leaving a Boston comedy club on November 9, 1997. A medical examination on the following day revealed injuries consistent with the victim&#x27;s testimony. No criminal charges were filed, but Billups and Mercer settled a civil suit in 2000. Before he was hired as the head coach for the Portland Trail Blazers, the club asserted that they had investigated this allegation and concluded it did not disqualify him from taking the role.

<doc id="644554" wikidata="Q6917242" url="?curid=644554" title="Mother's Day Proclamation">
<text>The &quot;Appeal to womanhood throughout the world&quot; (later known as &quot;Mothers&#x27; Day Proclamation&quot;) by Julia Ward Howe was an appeal for women to unite for peace in the world. Written in 1870, Howe&#x27;s &quot;Appeal to womanhood&quot; was a pacifist reaction to the carnage of the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War. The appeal was tied to Howe&#x27;s feminist conviction that women had a responsibility to shape their societies at the political level.

The original Mothers&#x27; Day Proclamation, Julia Ward Howe, 1870:Arise, then... women of this day!
Arise, all women who have hearts,
whether our baptism be that of water or of tears!
Say firmly:
We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies.
Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause.
Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience.
We, women of one country, will be too tender of those of another country to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs.

From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own.
It says: Disarm, Disarm!
The sword of murder is not the balance of justice.
Blood does not wipe out dishonor, nor violence vindicate possession.
As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home
for a great and earnest day of council.

Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead.
Let them then solemnly take council with each other as to the means whereby the great human family can live in peace, each bearing after his own kind the sacred impress, not of Caesar,
but of God.

In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask
that a general congress of women, without limit of nationality,
may be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient, and at the earliest period consistent with its objects,
to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.In 1872 Howe asked for the celebration of a &quot;Mothers&#x27; Day for Peace&quot; on 2 June of every year, but she was unsuccessful. The modern Mother&#x27;s Day, was established by Anna Jarvis 36 years later. While the day she established was different in significance from what Howe had proposed, Anna Jarvis was reportedly inspired by her mother&#x27;s work with Howe.

Today, an edited version of the appeal is included in the Unitarian Universalist hymnal &quot;Singing the Living Tradition&quot;.

<doc id="644559" wikidata="Q1066501" url="?curid=644559" title="Charles Woodson">
<text>Charles Cameron Woodson (born October 7, 1976) is an American former professional football player who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons with the Oakland Raiders and Green Bay Packers. He spent his first 14 seasons as a cornerback and his final four as a safety. Woodson played college football for the Michigan Wolverines, three times selected to the All-Big Ten team, twice earning All-American honors. As a junior in 1997, he was a national champion and the first defensive player in college football history to win the Heisman Trophy.

Selected with the fourth overall pick by the Raiders in the 1998 NFL draft, Woodson received Pro Bowl selections during his first four seasons and two first-team All-Pro honors. Woodson left the Raiders after eight seasons to join the Packers, where he played his next seven seasons. During his Packers tenure, Woodson was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2009 and won Super Bowl XLV, while extending his Pro Bowl selections to eight and his first-team All-Pro honors to four. He returned to the Raiders for his last three seasons, earning his ninth Pro Bowl selection in his final season.

One of the NFL&#x27;s most decorated players, Woodson is tied with Rod Woodson (no relation) and Darren Sharper for the most defensive touchdowns, second in interceptions returned for touchdowns, and tied with Ken Riley for the fifth-most interceptions. Woodson is also one of the few players to appear in a Pro Bowl during three different decades. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2018 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early life==
Woodson was born in Fremont, Ohio. As a senior at Ross High School, Woodson was named Ohio&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Football&quot;. He finished his high school football career with the school&#x27;s records for rushing yards (3,861) and scoring (466 points). In his senior season, he was a &quot;USA Today&quot; All-America selection and &quot;Parade&quot; High School All-American and recorded 2,028 yards and 230 points. All colleges recruited Woodson as a running back, while Michigan recruited him as a defensive back. In addition to playing football, Woodson also played basketball (point guard) and competed in track and field (relay sprinter and long jumper).

==College career==

Woodson attended the University of Michigan, where he played for coach Lloyd Carr&#x27;s Wolverines teams from 1995 to 1997. He became the starter after the second game of his freshman season and played in 34 straight games. In addition to playing cornerback, he returned punts and occasionally played as a wide receiver.

===Freshman season===
In 1995, Woodson was selected as the Big Ten Freshman of the Year, as well as being named to the All-Big Ten First-team by conference coaches, and the second-team by the media. He led the team with five interceptions and eight takeaways.

===Sophomore season===
In 1996, Woodson set a Wolverine record for pass breakups in a season, with 15. For his efforts, he was named the Chevrolet Defensive Player of the Year and an AP First-team All-American. He was also a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award and named to the All-Big Ten First-team by both the conference coaches and the media.

===Junior season===
In 1997, Woodson became the third Michigan player in program history to win the Heisman Trophy, joining Tom Harmon (1940) and Desmond Howard (1991). Woodson received 282 more voting points than runner-up Peyton Manning of Tennessee. He was the first primarily defensive player to win the prestigious award, with the only other defensive winner being two-way player Travis Hunter in 2024. Woodson led the Michigan Wolverines to an undefeated season and a share of the national championship in the same year. He also won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, as the best defensive college player, as well as winning the Chevrolet Defensive Player of the Year award for a second consecutive season. Woodson was named to the All-Big Ten first-team for a third consecutive season, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American. He also won the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, Big Ten Most Valuable Player and the Big Ten Male Athlete of the Year, amongst others.

Woodson finished his three-year collegiate career with 18 interceptions, currently second all-time in University of Michigan football history. Throughout college, Woodson was known for big plays, in big moments of games. As a freshman, he had two interceptions in a victory against the No. 2 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes. During his Heisman-winning junior year, he made an acrobatic one-handed sideline interception against the Michigan State Spartans. Woodson had two interceptions in the game. In a game against Ohio State, he returned a punt for a touchdown, made an interception in the end-zone, and had a 37-yard reception on Michigan&#x27;s only offensive touchdown scoring drive of the game. Woodson later stated that he tried to do Desmond Howard&#x27;s famous &quot;pose&quot; after scoring the touchdown, but failed after his teammates mobbed him in the end zone. The win over the Buckeyes lifted Michigan to the Rose Bowl. Michigan played the Washington State Cougars in the Rose Bowl, where Woodson recorded another end-zone interception, helping Michigan defeat the Cougars and win a share of the 1997 national championship.

==Professional career==

===Oakland Raiders===

==== Early NFL career ====
Woodson declared his eligibility for the NFL draft following his junior season at Michigan and was selected as the fourth overall pick in the 1998 draft by the Oakland Raiders.

After the 1998 season, Woodson was named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. He started all sixteen games, becoming the first rookie Raider since 1971 to do so. Woodson had 64 tackles that season. He was also third in the league in interceptions (with five), returned one interception for a touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals, and produced one forced fumble. Woodson was named to his first Pro Bowl.

In 1999, Woodson had his first career reception, a 19-yard catch, against the San Diego Chargers on November 14. On November 28, against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had a 15-yard interception return for a touchdown in the 37–34 loss. He finished the season with 61 total tackles and a fumble recovery to go along with the pick-six. Woodson was selected to his second Pro Bowl and was named All-Pro by the Associated Press.

In the 2000 season, Woodson started all sixteen games of the season but suffered a turf toe injury, which prevented him from practicing. He finished the year with a career-high 79 tackles, intercepted four passes, forced three fumbles, and recovered one fumble. He earned a third consecutive Pro Bowl nomination. He was named to the All-Pro team by Sports Illustrated, and second-team honors from the Associated Press.

In 2001, his fourth year in the NFL, Woodson started sixteen games. This was the fourth consecutive year Woodson played in every game of the season. Woodson finished with two sacks, one interception, one forced fumble, and one blocked field goal. Woodson returned punts for the first time in the NFL, returning four punts for 47 yards. On January 19, 2002, he participated in the Tuck Rule play against the New England Patriots in the postseason. He was named to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl. He made All-Pro teams of The Sporting News and College and Pro Football Newsweekly and the All-AFC squad of Football News.

==== First Super Bowl appearance ====
In 2002, Woodson suffered his first major injury since his freshman year at Michigan, suffering from a shoulder injury which caused him to be inactive for eight games. The shoulder injury came in the first half of the second game of the season. Despite the injury Woodson played the remainder of the game and was able to force a fumble. After recovering from his shoulder injury, Woodson missed the last three games of the regular season, suffering from a cracked fibula bone in his right leg. Woodson started every Raider game in the 2003 NFL Playoffs, finishing with a start in Super Bowl XXXVII. In the Super Bowl, Woodson showed signs of his injury, but still recorded an interception in a losing effort against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

After losing the Super Bowl in the year prior, the Raiders finished the 2003 season with a dismal 4–12 record. Woodson became unhappy with new head coach Bill Callahan, and criticized him during the season. Woodson remained healthy for the entire season, starting in his first fifteen games. His contract was set to expire after the season. Woodson reached an agreement with Oakland and was labeled as a franchise player. The franchise tag set Woodson&#x27;s contract with a minimum of the average salary for the top five cornerbacks in the NFL. Although being labeled as a franchise player, Woodson&#x27;s contract was only for one year.

In the 2004 season, Woodson played the first 13 games of the season before suffering a leg injury which put him inactive in the last three weeks. He finished the season with 73 total tackles, 2.5 sacks, one interception, nine passes defensed, two forced fumbles, and one fumble recovery. After the season, Woodson again agreed to a one-year franchise tag deal.

In 2005, he started the first six games but broke his leg in the sixth week, which sidelined him for the rest of the year. He finished the season with 30 total tackles, one interception, four passes defensed, and one forced fumble.

===Green Bay Packers===

==== Career resurgence ====

On April 26, 2006, Woodson and the Green Bay Packers reached a 7-year contract agreement that could be worth as much as $52.7 million with bonuses and incentives. He earned $10.5 million in the first year of the deal and $18 million over the first three years. He would have received a $3 million bonus if he was selected to the Pro Bowl in two of the first three years of the contract. Woodson has stated that at the time of the contract he &quot;did not want to come to Green Bay&quot; due to a perception that the city is less than cosmopolitan, but was forced to do so because the Packers were the only team to offer him a contract. The cornerback has since lauded the Packers organization, Mike McCarthy, and the people of Wisconsin for having faith in him, and has declared that &quot;it was truly a blessing coming to Green Bay.&quot;

Free of any major injuries during the 2006 season, Woodson (tied with Walt Harris formerly of the San Francisco 49ers) led the National Football Conference with eight interceptions. At the time, that was the most interceptions Woodson had recorded in a single season. On October 22, he had a 23-yard interception return for a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins. Overall, he was tied for third in that statistic in the entire NFL. He was used as his team&#x27;s starting punt returner for the first time in his NFL career, returning 41 punts for 363 yards.

On October 14, 2007, Woodson picked up a Santana Moss fumble and returned it 57 yards for a go-ahead touchdown in a 17–14 victory over the Washington Redskins. He recorded an interception in the game, his first of the season. Woodson was named the NFC&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Week for his performance versus the Redskins, which was the first time he had received that award. On November 4, Woodson had a 46-yard interception return for a touchdown with 59 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to seal a win over the Kansas City Chiefs. He finished the season with 63 total tackles, four interceptions, nine passes defensed, and two fumble recoveries.

On September 15, 2008, Woodson recorded two interceptions in a 48–25 victory over the Detroit Lions. He returned the second interception 41 yards for a touchdown. Woodson was named NFL Defensive Player of the Month for September in 2008. On December 16, 2008, Woodson was named to his fifth Pro Bowl, his first with the Packers. Overall, he finished the season with 62 total tackles, seven interceptions, two pick-sixes, 17 passes defensed, one forced fumble, and one fumble recovery.

==== 2009 season: Defensive Player of the Year ====
Woodson was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for September. On November 15, 2009, Woodson recorded nine tackles (two for loss), a sack, two forced fumbles and an interception in a 17–7 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Woodson is the first player in NFL history to have a sack, two forced fumbles, and an interception in a game. He was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week for his performance.

On November 26, 2009, Woodson had an impressive Thanksgiving game at Ford Field against the Detroit Lions. He recorded seven tackles, one sack, one forced fumble and recovery (same play), four passes defended and two interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. He covered star receiver Calvin Johnson and limited him to two catches for 10 yards. Although one of these was a touchdown, Green Bay won the game 34–12. Woodson was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week for this performance and was named NFC Defensive Player of the Month for the month of November.

In January 2010, Woodson was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for December 2009. He is the only defensive player to ever receive this award three times in the same season, and joins Barry Sanders and Mike Vanderjagt as the only NFL players to receive a Player of the Month award three times in a single season. For his effort during the 2009 season Woodson was selected as the AP Defensive Player of the Year. Overall, he finished the season with 74 total tackles, nine interceptions, three pick-sixes, 18 passes defensed, four forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, and two sacks.

Woodson had more interceptions in his first four years with the Packers (28) than he did in his previous eight with the Raiders (17). He also has more touchdowns (8 vs 2) and sacks (6 vs 5.5) with the Packers than he did during his time in Oakland. He holds the Packers&#x27; franchise record for most defensive touchdowns (eight total, seven interception returns and one fumble return). Woodson won the 2009 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award. He earned his sixth Pro Bowl and second First Team All-Pro nomination. He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame All-Decade Team for the 2000s.

====2010 season: Super Bowl champion====

On September 9, 2010, despite having three years left on his current contract, Woodson was offered and signed a two-year extension with the Packers, adding five years and $55 million to his existing pact. During the 2010 season, Woodson recorded two interceptions and five forced fumbles for the Packers. He was named to the 2011 Pro Bowl as a starting cornerback. It was his seventh career selection to the Pro Bowl. Woodson was named co-captain along with teammate A. J. Hawk for the Packers defensive unit through the post-season. He provided a huge performance, limiting Pro Bowler DeSean Jackson to just two catches (for 47 yards), and recorded five tackles in the Packers&#x27; win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card Round on January 9, 2011. Woodson also played an important role in Dom Capers&#x27; defense in playoff victories against the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round and the Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship and started against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. With 1:54 before halftime of the Super Bowl, Woodson broke his collar bone while diving to successfully defend a pass intended for Mike Wallace. An emotional Woodson gave a speech to his teammates during halftime. Watching from the sidelines in the second half, Woodson cheered his team on to a 31–25 victory, his only championship title. Despite his Super Bowl injury, Woodson finished the game with three total tackles, including two solo tackles.

Barack Obama said if the Bears won the NFC Championship, that he would see them play in Super Bowl XLV, but he would not see Green Bay. Woodson sent Obama a jersey saying, &quot;See you at the White House!&quot; and had a pep talk in the locker room. He told the team if the President did not want to see the Packers play in the Super Bowl then they would go to the White House. The Packers won the Super Bowl, but could not visit the White House until August because of the terms in the NFL Lockout. When they visited the White House, Obama made reference to Woodson&#x27;s pep rally and autographed jersey. Woodson responded by handing Barack Obama a certificate stating that Obama is a minority owner of the Packers. Obama also said, &quot;I have learned something that many quarterbacks have learned. Don&#x27;t mess with Charles Woodson.&quot;

Engraved inside the Super Bowl 45 Ring is the numeral &quot;1&quot; along with the words &quot;Mind, Goal, Purpose and Heart&quot;: the number and terms veteran cornerback Charles Woodson used during his memorable postgame locker room speech following the NFC Championship in Chicago. Woodson was ranked 16th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

==== Final years in Green Bay ====

When Woodson intercepted Cam Newton against the Carolina Panthers in Week 2 of the 2011 season, it marked the fourth time he intercepted a fellow Heisman Trophy winner. The other three quarterbacks he intercepted a pass from were Vinny Testaverde, Carson Palmer, and Matt Leinart. Against the Denver Broncos, Woodson joined the 50-interception club when he picked off Kyle Orton in the first quarter in Week 4. This, his eleventh career interception return for a touchdown, placed him second all-time behind Rod Woodson. He finished the season with 74 total tackles, seven interceptions, one pick-six, 17 passes defensed, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and two sacks. He earned his eighth Pro Bowl and third First Team All-Pro nomination.

Woodson started the 2012 season in a different role for the Packers, hoping to fill the void left by free safety Nick Collins, who had been out of football for almost a year with a neck injury. He described it simply as &quot;just playing football&quot;. Defensive Coordinator Dom Capers&#x27; plan was to play Woodson at the safety position, while also playing some time as the nickelback. This saw Woodson in a Polamalu-like position of the Pittsburgh Steelers, lining up on either side ready to rush or drop back in coverage. Against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 1, the 35 year old Woodson recorded five tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble in a losing effort. Against the Chicago Bears in Week 2, he recorded his 55th interception of his career, and first as a strong safety. The pass was intended for Earl Bennett. Woodson suffered a broken collarbone during the Packers&#x27; victory over the St. Louis Rams on Sunday, October 21, and was out for the next nine games. Overall, he finished the season with 38 total tackles, one interceptions, five passes defensed, one forced fumble, and 1.5 sacks.

Woodson sat out several weeks with the broken collarbone, but made it back for the first playoff game, the Wild Card Round against the Minnesota Vikings. He helped the Packers defeat the Vikings, but they would fall to the 49ers the following week in the Divisional Round. He was ranked 85th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.

On February 15, 2013, the Packers released Woodson.

===Oakland Raiders (second stint)===

==== Return to Oakland and retirement ====
On May 21, 2013, Woodson signed a one-year deal with the Oakland Raiders. He played in the preseason and started in week 1 against the Indianapolis Colts. On October 6, in a Week 5 game against the San Diego Chargers, Woodson tied the NFL record (with Darren Sharper and former teammate Rod Woodson) for most defensive touchdowns by scoring on a fumble recovery for his 13th defensive touchdown. He earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors for his game against the Chargers. By the end of the season, he had played in 1,067 of 1,074 possible defensive snaps for the team amassing 97 tackles (75 solo), two sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, three pass defenses, one interception, and the aforementioned touchdown.

In Week 14 of the 2014 season, Woodson earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors for his game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Woodson finished the 2014 season with 111 total tackles, four interceptions, eight passes defensed, one fumble recovery, and one sack. He was ranked 64th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.

On January 26, 2015, the Raiders announced via Twitter that they agreed to a contract for Woodson to return for the 2015 season. In the 2015 season, Woodson was moved to strong safety. After this switch, Woodson became one of the few players in NFL history to play at all three spots in the secondary. Prior to Week 5 against the Denver Broncos, Woodson said that he always wanted to intercept a pass from Peyton Manning, as he never accomplished that feat during his career. Woodson lived up to his word and picked off Manning two times. However, the Broncos won 16–10. Woodson was named AFC Defensive Player of the Month for October. On December 21, Woodson announced that he would retire at the end of the season. On January 3, 2016, he played in his final NFL game, a 23–17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. He finished his final season with 74 total tackles, five interceptions, nine passes defensed, one forced fumble, and four fumble recoveries. He was named to the Pro Bowl in his final season.

On February 12, 2016, it was announced that Woodson would be joining ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;, replacing Keyshawn Johnson for the upcoming season. He served in that capacity until 2018 when he moved to Fox Sports to cover college football as an analyst.

==Personal life==
Woodson is an oenophile who developed his interest in wine while playing football for the first time in Oakland, near the Napa Valley. He partnered with former Robert Mondavi winemaker Rick Ruiz to develop a signature wine label, &quot;Twentyfour by Charles Woodson&quot;. The company is based in Napa, California, and is a small boutique winery, producing fewer than one thousand cases per year of its two varieties, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Although the wine bears his name and signature, Woodson was warned by the NFL not to be seen endorsing the wine himself because of the league&#x27;s alcohol policy.

Woodson was arrested twice: in 2000 for DUI, and in 2004 for public intoxication after refusing to get out of a woman&#x27;s car.

Woodson is married to April Dixon Woodson and they have two sons together.

On November 26, 2009, Woodson contributed $2 million to the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children&#x27;s Hospital for pediatric research. Woodson has his own charitable foundation to support the fight against breast cancer called the Charles Woodson Foundation. In October 2012, Woodson donated $100,000 to the Hurricane Sandy relief effort.

During the Green Bay Packers&#x27; 2010 Super Bowl-winning season, Woodson publicly called out US President Barack Obama on his support for longtime Packers&#x27; rivals, the Chicago Bears. In a post-game locker room speech to his teammates, Woodson stated, &quot;The President don&#x27;t want to come watch us win the Super Bowl? Guess what? We&#x27;ll go see him&quot; (implying that Green Bay would win the Super Bowl and visit the White House as the winning team does each year). During the 2012 United States Presidential election campaign, Woodson publicly endorsed Obama at a political rally in Green Bay, stating &quot;I believe in what he&#x27;s trying to do.&quot;

<doc id="644571" wikidata="Q1377219" url="?curid=644571" title="Toyota AE86">
<text>The AE86 series of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota Sprinter Trueno are small, front-engine/rear-wheel-drive models within the front-engine/front-wheel-drive fifth generation Corolla (E80) range—marketed by Toyota from 1983 to 1987 in coupé and liftback configurations.

The cars were light, affordable, easily modifiable, and had a five-speed manual transmission, a limited slip differential (optional), MacPherson strut front suspension, near 50/50 front/rear weight balance, and a front-engine/rear-drive layout—at a time when this configuration was waning industry-wide. In certain areas of the world (and optional in others) it was powered by a high revving (7800 rpm) twin-cam engine. 

Widely popular for Showroom Stock, Group A, and Group N, Rally and Club racing, the cars&#x27; inherent qualities also earned the AE86 an early and enduring international prominence in the motorsport discipline of drifting. The AE86 was featured centrally in the popular, long-running Japanese manga and anime series titled &quot;Initial D&quot; (1995–2013)—as the main character&#x27;s drift and tofu delivery car. In 2015, Road &amp; Track called the AE86 &quot;a cult icon, inextricably interwoven with the earliest days of drifting.&quot;

The AE86 would go on to inspire the Toyota 86 (2012–present), a 2+2 sports car jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru, manufactured by Subaru—and marketed also as the Toyota GT86, Toyota GR86, Toyota FT86, Scion FR-S and Subaru BRZ.

In November 2021, Toyota temporarily restarted the production of a limited number of parts for the AE86, with dealers beginning to take orders for new steering knuckle arms and rear brake calipers. Rear axle half shafts have also been scheduled for new production. Toyota has also announced that this reboot is temporary, and parts will only be available as long as stocks last.

==Name==
The nameplate &quot;Trueno&quot; derives from the Spanish word for &quot;thunder&quot;, and &quot;Levin&quot; derives from the Middle English for &quot;lightning&quot;. In Japan, the Sprinter Trueno was exclusive to Toyota Japan dealerships called &quot;Toyota Auto Store,&quot; while the Corolla Levin was exclusive to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;.

The name &quot;AE86&quot; derives from Toyota&#x27;s internal code during the car&#x27;s development, designating the 1600 cc RWD model from the fifth generation of the Corolla. In Toyota&#x27;s code language, the &quot;A&quot; designates the car&#x27;s engine (4A series), &quot;E&quot; designates Corolla, &quot;8&quot; designates fifth generation (E80 series) and &quot;6&quot; designates the variant within this generation.

The AE86 is also called the &quot;&quot;, Japanese for &quot;eight-six&quot;. Similarly the AE85 was commonly called &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;eight-five&quot;. 
Bracketing a minor external facelift, models marketed between 1983 and 1985 are called &quot;&quot;zenki&quot; (前期, lit. &#x27;early period&#x27;), and those marketed from 1986 to 1987 are called &quot;kouki&quot;&quot; (後期, lit. &#x27;latter period&#x27;).

In 1986, Toyota marketed a limited edition model of the AE86 as the &quot;Black Limited&quot; model. It was advertised as a limited-production model with only 400 units, and was based on the Kouki Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX 3-door liftback.

==Engine/technicals==
The AE86 was available with a naturally aspirated 4A-GE inline-four engine, a DOHC four-valve-per-cylinder motor, in Japan and Europe, which was also used in the first-generation MR2 G Limited (AW11), Corona GT (AT141), Celica 1600GT-R (AA63) and Carina 1600GTR (AA63) (Japan only) with a compression ratio of 9.4:1. It had a maximum SAE gross power output of at 6,600 rpm and at 5,200 rpm of torque in standard form, though it was later down-rated to and in net output. The 4A-GE engines used in the AE86 and AW11 were also equipped with Denso electronic port fuel injection and T-VIS variable intake geometry.

In North America, a modified 4A-GEC engine was used to comply with California emissions regulations. Power was rated at and of torque.

The AE86 used ventilated disc brakes. The car was equipped with a MacPherson strut style independent suspension at the front and a four-link live axle with coil springs for the rear as well as stabilizer bars, front and rear, and an optional LSD. The AE86 came with a 5-speed manual gearbox, and later came with the option of an automatic.

Higher-spec American AE86 models known as the Sport GT-S featured the DOHC 4A-GEC engine, four-wheel disc brakes, had a T-series 6.7&quot; differential, color-matched bumpers, front lower bumper surround with a much more sporty and pronounced lip, molded door panels, tachometer redline at 7500 rpm, leather-wrapped steering wheel, seats with leather-wrapped tops (front seats are completely different from Sport SR5), optional LSD, and aluminium wheels. The VIN of the GT-S is AE88 (for North American market cars), however the chassis code on the engine firewall remained as AE86. The Sport GT-S can also be identified by the &quot;Q&quot; identification on the 4th digit of the model code, found on the chassis plate.

Lower-spec American AE86 models such as the Sport SR5 used the 4A-C SOHC unit, The S-series rear end was a 6.38&quot; non-LSD with drum brakes. The SR5 model also had a softer suspension, and small styling and interior changes such as seats, gauge cluster, door panels, un-painted matte black front and rear bumpers, the lower part of the front bumper surround is shorter and flat, and its VIN differs as well, being AE86 for the SR5 model (for North American market cars). The Sport SR5 can also be identified by the &quot;X&quot; identification on the 4th digit of the model code, found on the chassis plate.

Another lower-spec American AE86 model was the base-model DX, which had the same 4A-C SOHC unit and 6.38&quot; non-LSD rear end with drum brakes as the SR5. While being near-identical to the SR5, the DX lacks many of the options and features that were present on the SR5 and GT-S, such as a smaller center console, no rear sway bars, no air-conditioning, and a very basic interior. The DX was an internal Toyota designation and was absent in advertising and brochures, hence it was more uncommon than the SR5 and GT-S. The VIN of the DX is AE85 (not to be confused with the Japan-only AE85), but its chassis code on the engine firewall remained as AE86. The base-model DX can also be identified with the &quot;D&quot; identification on the 4th digit of the model code, found on the chassis plate.

Models equipped with the 4A-GE engine received a T-series rear differential, while 3A-U (only offered on the AE85), 4A-U and 4A-C models received a smaller, weaker, S-series rear differential.

The AE86 DX and SR5 (4A-C equipped) had an optional 4-speed automatic transmission alongside the 5-speed manual, however the GT-S model (with the 4A-GE DOHC engine) only came with a standard 5-speed manual gearbox.

One of the staff who was behind the car&#x27;s engineering work was Nobuaki Katayama, who would later head the company&#x27;s motorsport department and who would become chief engineer of the Altezza project a decade later. He has a photo of an AE86 hung in his office.

==Body styles==
The Levin and Trueno featured fixed-headlights and retractable headlights respectively, with both available as hatchback or coupé. The export model name Corolla applies to both variations. The AE86 (along with the lower spec AE85 and SR5 and DX versions) was rear wheel drive, built on the rear wheel drive E70 Corolla platform (same wheelbase length, interchangeable parts, etc.), unlike the front wheel drive E80 models in the same range.

=== Pre-facelift (Zenki) ===
=== Facelift (Kouki) ===
Minor bodywork changes were made in May 1985, which resulted in different taillights, updated bumpers with wrap-around front indicators, corner and headlight trim lights, interior, and grilles. New paint colors have been shuffled around as well. Both the Levin and Trueno now have halogen lamps as standard. The seats on the GT-V and GT-APEX models have also been redesigned. They are the main differences for both AE85/86 Levin and Trueno coupé and liftback models.

==Models/specifications==
In Japan, the DOHC 4A-GEU AE86 was offered in GT, GT-V and GT-APEX trims as the Corolla Levin or Sprinter Trueno. In North America, the top-spec DOHC 4A-GEC was sold as the Corolla Sport GT-S (with AE86 on the build plate in the engine bay but AE88 in the VIN), with the SOHC 4A-C being sold as the Corolla Sport DX and SR5 (with AE85 on the VIN but AE86 on the build plate in the engine bay in the DX and AE86 on the build plate and in the VIN in the SR5). Both versions were sold with Trueno pop-up headlights and Levin taillights, and had longer, heavier 5 mph (8 km/h) regulated bumpers in the front and rear. Euro-spec models were sold as the Corolla GT, Corolla GT Coupe, and Corolla GT-i, with DOHC engines and fixed Levin-style headlights. Australian models were sold as the Toyota Sprinter, with SOHC engines and also had fixed Levin headlights but with Trueno taillights as the taillights had the word &quot;Sprinter&quot; on them. New Zealand received a limited number of AE86s with DOHC 4A-GE engines, again with fixed Levin headlights. These AE86s were only offered in the 3-door liftback style. The Middle East received the same basic model as the North American market, with Trueno pop-up headlights, Levin taillights, and the regulated 5 mph (8 km/h) bumpers.

The lightest AE86 is the Japanese 2 door GT model which weighs about . It has the same exterior as the GT-V trim, but with the interior of the AE85 with the exception of the gauges, and is equipped with rear drum brakes.

=== Japanese AE86 specifications ===

There are three types of the Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno for the Japanese market: GT, GT-V, and GT-APEX.

Note that all AE86 models produced in Japan featured the 1.6 L 4A-GEU engine.

==The AE86 in motorsports==


While in production, the AE86 was a popular choice for showroom stock, Group A, and Group N racing, especially in rallying and circuit races. After production ended, many private teams continued to race the AE86, and it remains a popular choice for rallying and club races today.

Part of the continued appeal of the AE86 for motorsports is its rear-drive configuration, not available in most newer lightweight coupes. In Group A touring car races, the car either dominated the lower category where eligible or fought it out with Honda Civics or the later AE92s and AE101s whilst maintaining its competitiveness. In Ireland, where rallying is considered one of the most popular forms of motorsport, as organizing regulations are more relaxed compared to that of other countries, the AE86 was popular when new, and remains so popular that teams will purchase cars from the UK due to local shortages. The AE86 is also popular for rally use in Finland, where the cars can be competitive in the F-Cup competition for naturally aspirated 2WD cars.

The AE86 was entered in the European Touring Car Championship from 1984 to 1988 with a 4A-GEU engine. In 1986 it beat the BMW M6, BMW 325i (E30), Rover Vitesse, Volvo 240 Turbo, Merkur XR4Ti, Mazda 929, Holden Commodore (VK), Alfa Romeo 75 (turbo V6), and Mercedes 190E 2.3-16 to win the Manufacturers Championship with 267 points, surpassing the 1986 Drivers Championship Schnitzer Motorsport BMW M6.

In 1986 and 1987 Chris Hodgetts won the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC), beating the V8 Rover SD1&#x27;s, Ford Sierra Cosworth&#x27;s and BMW 3 Series (E30) M3&#x27;s two years running for an overall points victory driving an AE86 for Toyota (GB) PLC and his own race prep team CHMS.

The semi-factory supported Kraft team entered a spaceframe Trueno in the JGTC for the GT300 regulations in 1999. The Trueno used a Dallara F3 chassis and was powered with a 3S-GTE engine that came from a SW20 MR2 Turbo that produces about . Despite being popular with the fans, the car had minor success and was abandoned from use halfway through the 2001 season when the AE86 burst into flames during the third round of the season at Sugo. Kraft subsequently replaced it with the newly-delivered Toyota MR-S.

The rear wheel drive configuration, combined with the AE86&#x27;s light weight (approximately 2300 lb (950–970 kg) curb weight), balance and relatively powerful (and easy to tune) 4A-GEU engine made it popular among the Japanese &quot;hashiriya&quot; (street racers in Japanese), many of whom raced in &quot;touge&quot; (mountain passes in Japanese) where the corners suited the AE86 best, especially on the downhill. Among those who utilized this car was Japanese racing legend Keiichi Tsuchiya also known as the &quot;Drift King&quot; (&quot;Dori-Kin&quot; in Japanese). Keiichi Tsuchiya helped popularize the sport of drifting, which involves taking a car on a set of controlled slides through corners. The AE86&#x27;s FR configuration made it well suited to this kind of cornering, and currently the car is a mainstay of drift shows and competitions. Japanese drifters like Katsuhiro Ueo, Toshiki Yoshioka, Yoichi Imamura, Koichi Yamashita, Hiroshi Takahashi, Tetsuya Hibino, and Wataru Hayashi were also involved in making the AE86 famous in the drift scene.

AE86s around the world have been extensively modified for use in professional drifting.

==In popular culture==
The AE86 is considered as an iconic cultural symbol in Japanese popular culture following its inclusion in the &quot;Initial D&quot; anime and manga. The main character, Takumi Fujiwara, uses his father&#x27;s AE86 Trueno GT-APEX liftback for racing and making his tofu deliveries. Takumi&#x27;s friend, Itsuki Takeuchi, drives an AE85 Levin SR liftback. Throughout the series, two of Takumi&#x27;s opponents drive AE86s: Wataru Akiyama, who drives a turbocharged (later supercharged) AE86 Levin GT-APEX liftback, and Shinji Inui, who drives the notchback coupé version of the GT-APEX AE86 Trueno. The AE86 is also a playable vehicle in the &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage&quot; series. The popularity of &quot;Initial D&quot; is cited as the main cause of the car&#x27;s high resale price, which is often referred to as &quot;Takumi tax&quot; or &quot;Tofu tax&quot;, after the main character and his tofu delivery occupation respectively.

==Production==
The Toyota AE86 (as well as the AE85) was built in either the Kanto Higashi-Fuji plant, or the Takaoka plant. Over 360,000 AE86s are estimated to have been built in total.

AE86s built at the (now-closed) Kanto Higashi-Fuji plant came with a &quot;5&quot; designation at the beginning of the serial number. Their plant codes were &quot;M21&quot; and &quot;M22&quot;. Only 28% of AE86s were produced at this plant, all of them being made for Japan with no export models being made.

AE86s built at the Takaoka plant came with a &quot;0&quot; designation at the beginning of the serial number. Their plant codes were &quot;A54&quot; and &quot;A52&quot;. The majority of AE86s were produced at this plant (including exported AE86 models), as it was the original plant where the Toyota Corolla and Sprinter are manufactured.

<text>Mount Kirkpatrick () is a lofty, generally ice-free mountain in Queen Alexandra Range west of Mount Dickerson.
At it is the highest point in the Queen Alexandra Range, Antarctica.

==Exploration and name==
Mount Kirkpatrick was discovered and named by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–1909.
It was named for a Glasgow businessman, who was one of the original supporters of the expedition.

==Location==
Mount Kirkpatrick is in the central Queen Alexandra Range to the south of Grindley Plateau, north of the Adams Mountains and northeast of the Marshall Mountains.
Prebble Glacier forms on its west slopes and flows west to Lennox-King Glacier.
Mount Dickerson is to its east and Decennial Peak to its south.
Martin Ridge extends southwest from Decennial Peak to the head of Berwick Glacier.

==Fossil site==
Mount Kirkpatrick holds one of the most important fossil sites in Antarctica, the Hanson Formation. Because Antarctica used to be warmer and supported dense conifer and cycad forest, and because all the continents were fused into a giant supercontinent called Pangaea, many ancient Antarctic wildlife share relatives elsewhere in the world. Among these creatures are tritylodonts, herbivorous mammal-like reptiles that are prevalent elsewhere at the time. A crow-sized pterosaur has been identified. In addition to these finds, numerous dinosaur remains have been uncovered. Fossils of dinosaurs resembling &quot;Plateosaurus&quot;, &quot;Coelophysis&quot;, and &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; were excavated. Mount Kirkpatrick holds the first dinosaur scientifically named on the continent: the large predatory &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot;. In 2004, scientists have even found partial remains of a large sauropod plant-eating dinosaur.

&quot;Glacialisaurus hammeri&quot;, an herbivorous dinosaur thought to be around long and weighing perhaps 4-6 tons, was also identified from fossils on Mount Kirkpatrick in 2007, the only known site of &quot;Glacialisaurus hammeri&quot;.

<text>Hugh (13 May 1024 – 29 April 1109), sometimes called Hugh the Great or Hugh of Semur, was the Abbot of Cluny from 1049 until his death. He was one of the most influential leaders of the monastic orders from the Middle Ages.

==Biography==

Hugh was descended from the noblest families in Burgundy. He was the eldest son of Seigneur Dalmas I of Semur and Aremberge of Vergy, daughter of Henry I, Duke of Burgundy.

His father wanted him to be a knight, but recognizing his evident aversion to that, entrusted him to his grand-uncle Hugh, Bishop of Auxerre, for preparation for the priesthood. Under the protection of this relative, Hugh received his early education at the monastery school attached to the Priory of St. Marcellus. 

At the age of fourteen he entered the novitiate at Cluny and at the age of fifteen, took his monastic vows. He later became prior. In 1048 he accompanied the Bishop of Toul, pope-elect Bruno von Egisheim-Dagsburg, to Rome, where he was consecrated Pope Leo IX. The following year Prior Hugh was elected abbot of Cluny, succeeding Odilo. Later in 1049 he attended the Council of Reims, and in 1054, the Council of Tours. In March 1058, he was in Florence, where he attended Pope Stephen IX on his deathbed.

Abbot Hugh built the third abbey church at Cluny, the largest structure in Europe for many centuries, with funds provided by Ferdinand I of León and Henry I of England. In October 1085, Pope Urban II, a former prior of Cluny, consecrated the high altar.

In 1089 he established the Priory of St Pancras, the first Cluniac house in England.

After Clementia of Burgundy was married, she gave Hugh the Flemish monastery of St. Bertin. This act spread the Cluniac order north of the Loire and initiated monastic reform in Flanders. 

==Political influence==
Hugh&#x27;s relationship to Ferdinand I and Alfonso VI of León and Castile included the release of Alfonso from his brother Sancho&#x27;s prison. His influence upon Pope Urban II, who had been prior at Cluny under Hugh, made Hugh one of the most powerful and influential figures of the late 11th century. 

As the godfather of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, he also played a role as a mediator during the conflict between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV, though he was not successful. Additionally, he was an active diplomat to Germany and Hungary on behalf of the church. 

Abbot Hugh died in the Lady Chapel at Cluny on the evening of Easter Monday, 28 April 1109. Many of his relics were pillaged or destroyed by the Huguenots in 1575. His feast day is April 29.

<text>Gerald Patrick Mathers (born June 2, 1948) is a former American actor best known for his role in the television sitcom &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, originally broadcast from 1957 to 1963. He played the protagonist Theodore &quot;Beaver&quot; Cleaver, the younger son of the suburban couple June and Ward Cleaver (Barbara Billingsley and Hugh Beaumont, respectively) and the younger brother of Wally Cleaver (Tony Dow).

==Early life and family==
Mathers was born in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1948, the son of a high school principal, and grew up in the San Fernando Valley, California. Mathers has one sister and two brothers, including Jimmy Mathers.

==Early career==
Mathers began his career at the age of two when he appeared as a child model for a department store ad. Soon after, he starred in a commercial for PET Milk opposite vaudeville comedian Ed Wynn.

His early movies included &quot;This Is My Love&quot; (1954), &quot;Men of the Fighting Lady&quot; (1954), &quot;The Seven Little Foys&quot; (1955) and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s black comedy &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955), in which he plays Arnie, the son of Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s character, and finds Harry&#x27;s body in the nearby forest.

===&quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;===

Mathers states that he got the role of Beaver Cleaver after telling the show&#x27;s producers he would rather be at his Cub Scout meeting than to do an audition for the part. The producers found his candor appealing and perfect for the role. Mathers played the Beaver for six years, appearing in all 234 episodes of the series. He was the first child actor to have had a deal made on his behalf to get a percentage of the merchandising revenue from a television show. &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; still generates revenue more than six decades after its original production run.

The original sitcom has been shown in over 80 countries in 40 languages. Mathers noted that the &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; phenomenon is worldwide. &quot;I can go anywhere in the world, and people know me,&quot; Mathers has said. &quot;In Japan, the show&#x27;s called &quot;The Happy Boy and His Family&quot;. So I&#x27;ll be walking through the airport in Japan, and people will come up and say &#x27;Hi, Happy Boy!&#x27;&quot;

When asked in a 2014 television interview whether he had known at the time of the filming of &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; that the show was special, and would be in perpetual syndication, Mathers responded: &quot;No, not at all. I had worked since I was two years old. I did movies. I didn&#x27;t do any other series, but I had done a lot of movies and things like that so, in fact, every year it was a question whether we would come back for the next year &#x27;cause you had to be picked up. So you would do 39 shows and then we would go to New York and meet all the press, and then we&#x27;d go to Chicago to meet the ad people, then we&#x27;d come back and take about five to six weeks off, and if we got picked up, then we&#x27;d start again. So we did that for six years because that was the length of the contracts at those times. So that&#x27;s why there are 39 [episodes] for six years, and then it was off the air. Not off the air, but we didn&#x27;t film any new ones [after that.]&quot;

Mathers remained friends with Barbara Billingsley, who played his TV mother June Cleaver, and he remembered her after her death as &quot;a good friend and an even better mentor. For me she was like the favorite teacher that we all had in school.&quot;

===Music===
In 1962, near the end of the run of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, Mathers recorded two songs for a single 45 rpm: &quot;Don&#x27;t &#x27;Cha Cry,&quot; and for the flip side, the twist ditty &quot;Wind-Up Toy&quot;. During high school, Mathers had a band named Beaver and the Trappers.

==Education and military service==

As he moved into his adolescence, Mathers retired from acting to concentrate on high school. He attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. During this time, he led the musical band Beaver and the Trappers.

While still in high school, Mathers joined the U.S. military. From 1966 to 1969, he was a member of the 146th Airlift Wing, nicknamed The Hollywood Guard, of the California Air National Guard in Van Nuys, California. In 1967, while wearing his dress uniform, Mathers, along with child actress Angela Cartwright, presented an Emmy Award to Gene Kelly. In December 1969, a rumor began that Mathers was killed in action in the Vietnam War. Although the origin of the rumor is unclear, Mathers never saw action and was never stationed outside the United States. In 1980, Mathers and Dow appeared with Bill Murray on &quot;Saturday Night Live&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment, making fun of the Vietnam War death rumor.

Mathers graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from University of California, Berkeley in 1973.

==Later career==

After college, Mathers worked as a commercial loan officer at a bank. He then used well-invested savings from his acting career, in which he earned a starting weekly salary of $500, to begin a career in real estate development.

In 1978, he reentered the entertainment industry. That year, he and Tony Dow starred in a production of the comedy play &quot;Boeing, Boeing&quot; which ran for 10 weeks in Kansas City, Missouri. Mathers and Dow then toured the dinner theater circuit in a production of &quot;So Long, Stanley&quot;, written specifically for the TV brother duo, for 18 months.

In 1981, he worked as a disc jockey at KEZY radio in Anaheim, California.

In 1983, Mathers reprised his role in the television reunion film &quot;Still the Beaver&quot;, which featured the majority of the original cast from &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. The success of the television movie led to the development of a series with the same title. The series began airing on the Disney Channel in 1984, then aired on TBS and broadcast syndication, where it was retitled &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; and ran until 1989.

In the 1990s, Mathers guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, &quot;Vengeance Unlimited&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and as himself on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. In 1998, he released his memoir &quot;And Jerry Mathers as The Beaver&quot;.

In 2001, he appeared on a special episode of &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, titled &quot;Child TV stars edition,&quot; where he got voted off in the first round. On June 5, 2007, he made his Broadway debut with a starring role as Wilbur Turnblad in the musical &quot;Hairspray&quot; at the Neil Simon Theatre. In 2009, Mathers became the national spokesman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and its Partnership for Prescription Assistance.

In 2018 and 2019, Mathers promoted &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; and other classic television shows on MeTV.

==Personal life==

Mathers has been married three times. He met his first wife, Diana Platt, in college. They married in 1974 and later divorced. Mathers met his second wife, Rhonda Gehring, while touring in the production of &quot;So Long, Stanley&quot;. They have three children: Noah, Mercedes, and Gretchen. Mathers and Gehring divorced in 1997. Mathers married his third wife, Teresa Modnick, on January 30, 2011.

===Diabetes===
Mathers was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1996. On the advice of his doctor, Mathers enrolled in a weight loss program in May 1997 and lost over , and later became the company&#x27;s first male spokesperson. He represented a Type 2 diabetes reversal program&#x27;s publications in a television ad.

<text>The fuddle duddle incident in Canadian political history occurred on February 16, 1971, when Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau was alleged to have spoken or at least mouthed unparliamentary language in the House of Commons, causing a minor scandal. Trudeau mentioned the words &quot;fuddle duddle&quot; in an ambiguous answer to questions about what he may or may not have said in Parliament.

In February 1971, opposition MPs accused Trudeau of having mouthed the words &quot;fuck off&quot; at them in the House of Commons. When pressed by television reporters on the matter, Trudeau would only freely admit having moved his lips, answering the question, &quot;What were you thinking, when you moved your lips?&quot; by rhetorically asking in return &quot;What is the nature of your thoughts, gentlemen, when you say &#x27;fuddle duddle&#x27; or something like that? God, you guys!&quot; Thus, it remained unclear what Trudeau actually mouthed.

In a 2015 speech, his son, and later Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau stated that his father &quot;didn&#x27;t actually just say &#x27;fuddle duddle&#x27;&quot;.

==Origin of the phrase==
Trudeau may have coined the phrase on the spot. It did not gain wide currency in the long term, and did not enter most dictionaries of Canadian English other than the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.

==Media coverage==
An unofficial transcript of the CBC clip is as follows:

==In popular culture==
There was, in 1971–72, a short-lived satirical magazine called &quot;Fuddle Duddle: The Hansard of the Common People&quot;, which aspired to be the Canadian equivalent of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. However, it lasted only five issues before publication ceased.

At least two songs related to the incident were released as record singles, and made the lower reaches of the Canadian charts. &quot;Fuddle Duddle&quot; by Antique Fair was written by Greg Hambleton and released on the Tuesday label through Quality Records (catalogue GH107X), reaching #68 on RPM&#x27;s national chart. &quot;Do the Fuddle Duddle&quot; was written by Gary Alles, performed by The House of Commons and released on GRT Records (catalogue 1233–04). It peaked at #82 on the RPM chart. Members of the ad hoc group &quot;The House of Commons&quot; later helped form the successful Canadian chart group Dr. Music. The Rolf Harris song &quot;Vancouver Town &#x27;71&quot; (#68 in Canada) also mentions how Alaskan oil could &quot;leave our coast all fuddle-duddled up&quot;.

Mont Tremblant Resort has a ski run named Fuddle Duddle. Trudeau had been a regular visitor to the resort in the past.

===Justin Trudeau===

A similar incident took place on December 14, 2011, when Trudeau&#x27;s son Justin, MP for Papineau, during Question Period in the House of Commons, shouted out the words &quot;piece of shit&quot; when Peter Kent, the Conservative Environment Minister, criticized NDP environment critic Megan Leslie for not attending the Durban Conference on climate change, despite the government banning all opposition MPs from joining Canada&#x27;s delegation. 

Later on, when Justin Trudeau was prime minister, another incident occurred on May 4, 2022, when Conservative MP John Brassard accused Trudeau of &quot;unparliamentary language&quot; and &quot;dropping an F-bomb&quot; during a heated debate in Question Period. Upon leaving the chamber, Trudeau was asked by reporters to comment on the allegations; in an apparent reference to his father&#x27;s response to the Fuddle Duddle controversy, he said, &quot;what is the nature of your thoughts, gentlemen, when you say — when you move your lips in a particular way?&quot;

Reporting the results of the 2015 Canadian federal election, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; newspaper front cover headline was &quot;Fuddle Duddle&quot; in response to the Justin Trudeau Liberal majority outcome.

<text>Ashoke Sen FRS (; born 1956) is an Indian theoretical physicist and distinguished professor at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Bangalore. A former distinguished professor at the Harish-Chandra Research Institute, Prayagraj, He is also an honorary fellow in National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) India he is also a Morningstar Visiting professor at MIT and a distinguished professor at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study. His main area of work is string theory. He was among the first recipients of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics &quot;for opening the path to the realization that all string theories are different limits of the same underlying theory&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born on 15 July 1956 in Kolkata, and is the elder son of Anil Kumar Sen, a former professor of physics at the Scottish Church College, Kolkata, and Gouri Sen, a homemaker.

After completing his schooling from Sailendra Sircar Vidyalaya in Kolkata, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1975 from the Presidency College under the University of Calcutta, and his master&#x27;s a year later from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. During his undergraduate studies at Presidency, he was greatly inspired by the work and teaching of Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri. He did his doctoral work in physics at Stony Brook University.

==Career==
Ashoke Sen made a number of major original contributions to the subject of string theory, including his landmark paper on strong-weak coupling duality or S-duality, which was influential in changing the course of research in the field. He pioneered the study of unstable D-branes and made the famous Sen conjecture about open string tachyon condensation on such branes. His description of rolling tachyons has been influential in string cosmology. He has also co-authored many important papers on string field theory.

In 1998, he won the fellowship of the Royal Society on being nominated by the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. His contributions include the entropy function formalism for extremal black holes and its applications to attractors. His recent important works include the attractor mechanism and the precision counting of microstates of black holes, and new developments in string perturbation theory. He joined the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) India as an honorary professor in the School of Physical Sciences. In the year 2020, he joined Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal (IISER Bhopal), Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India as a Visiting / Adjunct Professor in the department of Physics. He is currently serving as a distinguished professor at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Bangalore where he is working on string theory.

<doc id="644621" wikidata="Q1202882" url="?curid=644621" title="Bosonic string theory">
<text>Bosonic string theory is the original version of string theory, developed in the late 1960s and named after Satyendra Nath Bose. It is so called because it contains only bosons in the spectrum.

In the 1980s, supersymmetry was discovered in the context of string theory, and a new version of string theory called superstring theory (supersymmetric string theory) became the real focus. Nevertheless, bosonic string theory remains a very useful model to understand many general features of perturbative string theory, and many theoretical difficulties of superstrings can actually already be found in the context of bosonic strings.

== Problems ==

Although bosonic string theory has many attractive features, it falls short as a viable physical model in two significant areas.

First, it predicts only the existence of bosons whereas many physical particles are fermions.

Second, it predicts the existence of a mode of the string with imaginary mass, implying that the theory has an instability to a process known as &quot;tachyon condensation&quot;.

In addition, bosonic string theory in a general spacetime dimension displays inconsistencies due to the conformal anomaly. But, as was first noticed by Claud Lovelace, in a spacetime of 26 dimensions (25 dimensions of space and one of time), the critical dimension for the theory, the anomaly cancels. This high dimensionality is not necessarily a problem for string theory, because it can be formulated in such a way that along the 22 excess dimensions spacetime is folded up to form a small torus or other compact manifold. This would leave only the familiar four dimensions of spacetime visible to low energy experiments. The existence of a critical dimension where the anomaly cancels is a general feature of all string theories.

== Types of bosonic strings ==

There are four possible bosonic string theories, depending on whether open strings are allowed and whether strings have a specified orientation. A theory of open strings must also include closed strings, because open strings can be thought of as having their endpoints fixed on a D25-brane that fills all of spacetime. A specific orientation of the string means that only interaction corresponding to an orientable worldsheet are allowed (e.g., two strings can only merge with equal orientation). A sketch of the spectra of the four possible theories is as follows:

Note that all four theories have a negative energy tachyon (formula_1) and a massless graviton.

The rest of this article applies to the closed, oriented theory, corresponding to borderless, orientable worldsheets.

== Mathematics ==

=== Path integral perturbation theory ===

Bosonic string theory can be said to be defined by the path integral quantization of the Polyakov action:

: formula_2

formula_3 is the field on the worldsheet describing the most embedding of the string in 25 +1 spacetime; in the Polyakov formulation, formula_4 is not to be understood as the induced metric from the embedding, but as an independent dynamical field. formula_5 is the metric on the target spacetime, which is usually taken to be the Minkowski metric in the perturbative theory. Under a Wick rotation, this is brought to a Euclidean metric formula_6. M is the worldsheet as a topological manifold parametrized by the formula_7 coordinates. formula_8 is the string tension and related to the Regge slope as formula_9.

formula_10 has diffeomorphism and Weyl invariance. Weyl symmetry is broken upon quantization (Conformal anomaly) and therefore this action has to be supplemented with a counterterm, along with a hypothetical purely topological term, proportional to the Euler characteristic:

: formula_11

The explicit breaking of Weyl invariance by the counterterm can be cancelled away in the critical dimension 26.

Physical quantities are then constructed from the (Euclidean) partition function and N-point function:

: formula_12
: formula_13

The discrete sum is a sum over possible topologies, which for euclidean bosonic orientable closed strings are compact orientable Riemannian surfaces and are thus identified by a genus formula_14. A normalization factor formula_15 is introduced to compensate overcounting from symmetries. While the computation of the partition function corresponds to the cosmological constant, the N-point function, including formula_16 vertex operators, describes the scattering amplitude of strings.

The symmetry group of the action actually reduces drastically the integration space to a finite dimensional manifold. The formula_4 path-integral in the partition function is &quot;a priori&quot; a sum over possible Riemannian structures; however, quotienting with respect to Weyl transformations allows us to only consider conformal structures, that is, equivalence classes of metrics under the identifications of metrics related by

: formula_18

Since the world-sheet is two dimensional, there is a 1-1 correspondence between conformal structures and complex structures. One still has to quotient away diffeomorphisms. This leaves us with an integration over the space of all possible complex structures modulo diffeomorphisms, which is simply the moduli space of the given topological surface, and is in fact a finite-dimensional complex manifold. The fundamental problem of perturbative bosonic strings therefore becomes the parametrization of Moduli space, which is non-trivial for genus formula_19.

==== h = 0 ====

At tree-level, corresponding to genus 0, the cosmological constant vanishes: formula_20.

The four-point function for the scattering of four tachyons is the Shapiro-Virasoro amplitude:

: formula_21

Where formula_22 is the total momentum and formula_23, formula_24, formula_25 are the Mandelstam variables.

==== h = 1 ====

Genus 1 is the torus, and corresponds to the one-loop level. The partition function amounts to:

: formula_26

formula_27 is a complex number with positive imaginary part formula_28; formula_29, holomorphic to the moduli space of the torus, is any fundamental domain for the modular group formula_30 acting on the upper half-plane, for example formula_31. formula_32 is the Dedekind eta function. The integrand is of course invariant under the modular group: the measure formula_33 is simply the Poincaré metric which has PSL(2,R) as isometry group; the rest of the integrand is also invariant by virtue of formula_34 and the fact that formula_32 is a modular form of weight 1/2.

This integral diverges. This is due to the presence of the tachyon and is related to the instability of the perturbative vacuum.

<text>Kenneth Bruce Gorelick (born June 5, 1956), known professionally as Kenny G, is an American smooth jazz saxophonist, composer, and producer. His 1986 album &quot;Duotones&quot; brought him commercial success. Kenny G is one of the best-selling artists of all time, with global sales totaling more than 75 million records.

Kenny G was born in Seattle, Washington and started playing the saxophone aged 10, inspired by a performance on The Ed Sullivan Show. He attended several schools in Seattle, including the University of Washington. During high school, he took private saxophone lessons and played in the school jazz band.

Kenny G&#x27;s professional career began with Barry White&#x27;s The Love Unlimited Orchestra at age 17. He played with the Seattle funk band Cold, Bold &amp; Together before joining the Jeff Lorber Fusion in 1980. His solo career took off after signing with Arista Records in 1982. His debut album, &quot;Kenny G&quot;, was recorded with members of the Jeff Lorber Fusion and released in 1982. Kenny G&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Duotones&quot; (1986), marked the start of his most commercially successful period, featuring the hit single &quot;Songbird&quot;. His 1992 album, &quot;Breathless&quot;, became the best-selling instrumental album ever, and his first holiday album, &quot;&quot;, sold over 13 million copies. He has worked on soundtracks for films such as &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; and collaborated with artists, including Andrea Bocelli and Frank Sinatra.

In the 2000s and 2010s, Kenny G released several albums, including &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Brazilian Nights&quot;. He made appearances in commercials and music videos and continued to perform worldwide. Kenny G&#x27;s popularity in China is notable, with his song &quot;Going Home&quot; widely used in public places. Despite facing criticism from some jazz musicians, Kenny G remains a highly successful and influential figure in contemporary instrumental music.

== Early life ==
Kenneth Bruce Gorelick was born in Seattle, Washington to a Jewish family. His mother was a Canadian Jew from Saskatchewan. He came into contact with the saxophone when he heard a performance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. He started playing the saxophone, a Buffet Crampon alto, in 1966 when he was 10 years old.

He attended Whitworth Elementary School, Sharples Junior High School (since renamed Kurose Middle School), Franklin High School, and the University of Washington, all in his home city of Seattle. When he entered high school, he failed at his first attempt to get into the jazz band but auditioned again the following year and earned first chair. His Franklin High School classmate Robert Damper (piano, keyboards) plays in his band. In addition to his studies while in high school, he took private lessons on the saxophone and clarinet from Johnny Jessen, once a week for a year.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Kenny G&#x27;s career started with a job as a sideman for Barry White&#x27;s Love Unlimited Orchestra in 1973, when he was 17 and still in high school. He continued to play professionally while studying for a major in accounting at the University of Washington in Seattle, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude. He qualified, and only needed to pass the CPA exam to get into practice.

Using the name Kenny Gorelick, he played flute and saxophones with the Seattle funk band Cold, Bold &amp; Together during 1975–1976 before becoming a credited member of the Jeff Lorber Fusion in 1980. He then left the band, later stating that he had outgrown them.

=== 1980s: Start of solo career, &quot;Duotones&quot;, and &quot;Silhouette&quot; ===
Kenny G signed with Arista Records as a solo artist in 1982, after label president Clive Davis heard his rendition of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; by ABBA. He adopted Kenny G as his stage name because it &quot;had a nice ring to it&quot;. His debut studio album, &quot;Kenny G&quot;, was recorded in 1981 with members of the Jeff Lorber Fusion, and released in the following year. The album received warm reviews from critics, and reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jazz Albums chart. Kenny G followed his debut with &quot;G Force&quot; in January 1983 and &quot;Gravity&quot; in May 1985, both of which reached Platinum certification in the US for selling one million copies. During this time, he collaborated with musician, singer, songwriter, and producer Kashif on many tracks, including the 1985 single &quot;Love on the Rise&quot;.

In 1986, Kenny G entered the most commercially successful period of his career. His fourth solo album, &quot;Duotones&quot;, was released in September 1986 and features an original instrumental track, &quot;Songbird&quot;, inspired by his decision to move from Seattle to Los Angeles, which marked the start of a new life for him. The album went on to sell five million copies in the US alone and increased his profile worldwide as a result. &quot;Songbird&quot; reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Wait for Love&quot;, featuring Lenny Williams on lead vocals, went to No. 15 on the Hot 100 and No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart in 1987.

Kenny G worked in the mid-to-late 1980s with jazz and R&amp;B artists such as George Benson, Patti LaBelle and Aretha Franklin. The 1987 hit single &quot;Love Power&quot;, a Dionne Warwick duet with Jeffrey Osborne that featured G as a guest saxophonist, peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and No. 5 on R&amp;B/Hip-Hop songs.

His first live album, &quot;Kenny G Live&quot;, included popular songs, among which &quot;Going Home&quot; achieved great success in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Kenny G has collaborated with a wide variety of artists, such as Andrea Bocelli, Aaron Neville, Toni Braxton, DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, Natalie Cole, Steve Miller, Weezer, Dudley Moore, Lee Ritenour, The Rippingtons, Michael Bolton, Celine Dion, Frank Sinatra, Bebel Gilberto, and Smokey Robinson. Influenced by saxophonist Grover Washington Jr., his albums are usually classified as smooth jazz.

=== 1990s: &quot;Breathless&quot;, &quot;Miracles&quot;, and &quot;The Moment&quot; ===
Kenny G has worked on several film soundtracks, including &quot;Dying Young&quot; and &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. The song &quot;Theme for &quot;Dying Young&quot;&quot;, written for that movie, was nominated for the Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. Kenny G appears on the soundtrack of &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston, performing &quot;Waiting for You&quot; and &quot;Even If My Heart Would Break&quot;. His music was also included in &quot;The Shadow&quot; and &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;.

His sixth studio album, &quot;Breathless&quot;, was released in 1992, and went on to become the best-selling instrumental album ever, with over 15 million copies sold worldwide, selling 12 million copies in the United States alone. The album included many hits such as &quot;Forever in Love&quot;, the recipient of the Grammy Award for the Best Instrumental Composition and which charted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Hot 100. &quot;Sentimental&quot; charted at No. 27 on the Adult Contemporary Chart, and &quot;By the Time This Night Is Over&quot;, a collaboration with Peabo Bryson, peaked at No. 25 on the Hot 100.

His first holiday album, &quot;&quot;, sold over 13 million copies, making it the most successful Christmas album to date. He also performed the &quot;National Anthem of the United States&quot; at the 1994 FIFA World Cup closing ceremony at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on July 17, 1994.
Kenny G earned a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in 1997 for playing the longest note ever recorded on a saxophone. Using circular breathing, Kenny G held an E-flat for 45 minutes and 47 seconds at J&amp;R Music World in New York City. The same year, his song &quot;Havana&quot;, from the album &quot;The Moment&quot;, was remixed by Todd Terry and Tony Moran and released to dance clubs in the U.S. The mixes went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Play Songs chart in April 1997.

Kenny G&#x27;s second holiday album, &quot;&quot;, is the best selling holiday album of 1999 in the United States selling 2 million units according to Nielsen/SoundScan. The singles taken from the album, the traditional &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, reached No. 7 on the Hot 100. His rendition of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; was, at the time of charting, popularized by the then-upcoming New Year celebration for 2000. At the time of its peak, it was also the oldest-written song to make the Hot 100 charts.

=== 2000s ===
In February 2000, Kenny G was invited to the White House and performed for state governors and members of the Clinton Cabinet.

He released his eighth studio album, &quot;Paradise&quot; in 2002. The album featured R&amp;B singer Brian McKnight and included the single &quot;One More Time&quot;, a duet with Chanté Moore.

On &quot;At Last...The Duets Album&quot;, he collaborated with friends and colleagues David Sanborn, David Benoit; Daryl Hall, lead singer of Hall &amp; Oates; Burt Bacharach, and Barbra Streisand. It includes covers such as Careless Whisper, and Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;, a collaboration with Richard Marx. The album is certified Gold in the US.
In 2006, Kenny G released his eleventh studio album, entitled &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love...The Most Romantic Melodies of All Time&quot; featuring renditions of The Beatles&#x27;s songs, the love theme from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the Secret Garden&#x27;s hit song &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, and James Blunt&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Beautiful&quot;, as well as the Chinese ballad &quot;The Moon Represents My Heart&quot;.

Kenny G was named the 25th highest-selling artist in America by the RIAA, with 48 million albums sold in the U.S. as of July 31, 2006.

In October 2009, Kenny G appeared with the band Weezer in an AOL promotion of their album &quot;Raditude&quot; by soloing during &quot;I&#x27;m Your Daddy&quot;. Kenny G said he knew nothing of Weezer before the performance. Though some music critics thereby rejoined in the common criticism of his work, the unlikely combination was fairly well received by AOL&#x27;s magazines &quot;Spinner.com&quot; and Popeater.com.

=== 2010s ===
His 2010 album &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; is strongly influenced by R&amp;B, featuring Robin Thicke and his long-time collaborator Babyface. It received positive reviews from critics.

In February 2011, Kenny G appeared in the Super Bowl XLV ad for Audi called &quot;Release the Hounds&quot;. He starred in a short as Head of Riot Suppression for a luxury Prison.

He made an appearance in the music video for Katy Perry&#x27;s single &quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot; as Uncle Kenny. On the October 8, 2011 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, he performed with alternative rock band Foster the People on the song &quot;Houdini&quot;.

Kenny G hosts a radio show with Sandy Kovach on WLOQ in Orlando.

His &quot;Brazilian Nights&quot; was announced on October 28, 2014. The album was inspired by Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s bossa nova recordings, Paul Desmond, and Stan Getz. The album was released in January 2015. It helped Kenny G get back to the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 86. He started The Brazilian Tour for the album, traveling throughout North America and Asia throughout the year.

Kenny G posted Twitter images of his visit to the site of the 2014 Hong Kong protests, which the PRC government has declared illegal, saying, &quot;I wish everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation&quot;. The feed provoked an immediate angry reaction from the Chinese foreign ministry. Kenny G issued a clarification, &quot;I don&#x27;t really know anything about the situation and my impromptu visit to the site was just part of an innocent walk around Hong Kong...I only wanted to share my wish for peace for Hong Kong and for all of China as I feel close to and care about China very much&quot;.

In February 2017, Kenny G was satirized by Andy Samberg in the Netflix program &quot;Michael Bolton&#x27;s Big, Sexy Valentine&#x27;s Day Special&quot;. At the end of the scene, Kenny G appears as a janitor. He competed in an episode of &quot;Drop the Mic&quot; against country singer Jake Owen.

In October 2019, Kenny G appeared on the Kanye West gospel album &quot;Jesus Is King&quot;, on the song &quot;Use This Gospel&quot;. Reaching 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the song was his first entry on the chart since 2000 and resulted in his becoming one of just five artists—alongside Michael Jackson, Madonna, U2 and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic—to have appeared in the top 40 every decade from the 1980s to the 2010s.

=== 2020s ===

In October 2020, the Weeknd released a remix of the popular song In Your Eyes featuring Kenny G.

Kenny G contributed to the soundtrack of &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; in 2021 with his covers of &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; as well as &quot;Gary&#x27;s Song&quot;, which had been written for the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Have You Seen This Snail?&quot; The Nickelodeon series parodies the artist with the character Kelpy G.

In 2022, he appeared on avant-garde metal band Imperial Triumphant&#x27;s song &quot;Merkurius Gilded&quot; alongside his son Max Gorelick on guitar.

== Popularity in China ==
Kenny G has recorded Chinese songs such as &quot;Jasmine Flower&quot; (茉莉花) and &quot;The Moon Represents My Heart&quot; (月亮代表我的心).

Since 1989, Kenny G&#x27;s recording &quot;Going Home&quot; from the &quot;Kenny G Live&quot; album has become an unconventional mega-hit throughout China: It has become the unofficial national closing song for many businesses such as food courts, outdoor markets, health clubs, shopping malls and train stations throughout the country. Many businesses begin piping the music over their loudspeakers shortly before closing at night. Television stations also play the song before ending their evening broadcasts. Many Chinese, when asked, say they associate the song with the need to finish their activity or business and go home (although they may not even know the name of the song or its artist).

== Criticism ==
Kenny G has attracted significant criticism from mainstream jazz musicians and enthusiasts. Pat Metheny found him &quot;not really an advanced player, even [among pop-oriented sax players of that time]&quot;, adding that, according to his opinion, Kenny G had &quot;major rhythmic problems&quot; and his &quot;harmonic and melodic vocabulary was extremely limited, mostly to pentatonic-based and blues-lick derived patterns&quot;. Metheny stated that the &quot;controversy&quot; that has surrounded Kenny G &quot;among musicians and serious listeners&quot; is due to the fact that &quot;he sells an enormous amount of records while not being anywhere near a really great player in relation to the standards that have been set on his instrument over the past sixty or seventy years&quot;. Saxophonist, composer and bandleader Branford Marsalis, stating that he was refusing to &quot;fight that silly war between jazz and smooth jazz&quot;, called on G&#x27;s critics as follows: &quot;When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He&#x27;s not stealing jazz. The audience he has wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead at a real jazz concert or club. It&#x27;s not like some guy says, &#x27;You know, I used to listen to Miles, Trane and Ornette. And then I heard Kenny G, and I never put on another Miles record.&#x27; It&#x27;s a completely different audience.&quot;

Kenny G&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; was particularly criticized for its overdubbing of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s recording of the same song. Mark Sabbatini found G&#x27;s cover to be an &quot;unconscionable act of auditory graffiti&quot; over the Armstrong song. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Ben Ratliff opined that a recording by Armstrong, known especially for improvisation, should not be altered by a musician &quot;whose range and depth of understanding was already in question.&quot; Alto saxophonist Charles McPherson expressed &quot;mixed feelings&quot;, stating that Kenny G&#x27;s &quot;audience probably does not know Armstrong or Getz or Charlie Parker. So, if he feels like his audience should be more familiar with those people, I can&#x27;t see anything aesthetically wrong with that.&quot; On the other hand, pianist Fred Hersch, commenting on the occasion of that cover track, said that Kenny G is &quot;not a jazz musician.&quot;

Critic Josef Woodard found Kenny G serving &quot;a noble purpose by offering musicians a paradigm of what &quot;not&quot; to do&quot; in a &quot;JazzTimes&quot; poll in which, though, players such as Stan Kenton, Maynard Ferguson, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman were characterized as &quot;overrated&quot;.

In 2021, HBO released a documentary on Kenny G, &quot;Listening to Kenny G&quot;, directed by Penny Lane. Lane stated she chose Kenny G as her subject because he is &quot;a musician who is objectively popular, by way of record sales, but is also hated by the &#x27;critical class&#x27;.&quot; Richard Brody, in a &quot;New Yorker&quot; report, cited Kenny G in the film responding &quot;cheerful[ly]&quot; to a question about what he loves about music, with, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I love music that much,&quot; and continuing, &quot;when I listen to music, I think about the musicians and I just think about what it takes to make that music and how much they had to practice.&quot;

== Equipment ==
Kenny G plays the Selmer Mark VI soprano, alto and tenor saxophones. He has created his own line of saxophones called &quot;Kenny G Saxophones&quot;.

Kenny G built a house in Hunts Point, Washington, in 1996 which he sold in 1999 to Craig McCaw. Kenny G now lives in Malibu, California. He is an avid golfer and has a handicap of +0.6.

<doc id="644624" wikidata="Q1536208" url="?curid=644624" title="Goldwater–Nichols Act">
<text>The Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of October 4, 1986 (; signed by President Ronald Reagan) made the most sweeping changes to the United States Department of Defense since the department was established in the National Security Act of 1947 by reworking the command structure of the U.S. military. It increased the powers of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and implemented some of the suggestions from the Packard Commission, commissioned by President Reagan in 1985. Among other changes, Goldwater–Nichols streamlined the military chain of command, which now runs from the president through the secretary of defense directly to combatant commanders (CCDRs, all four-star generals or admirals), bypassing the service chiefs. The service chiefs were assigned to an advisory role to the president and the secretary of defense, and given the responsibility for training and equipping personnel for the unified combatant commands.

Named after Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona) and Representative William Flynt &quot;Bill&quot; Nichols (D-Alabama), the bill passed the House of Representatives, 383–27, and the Senate, 95–0. It was signed into law by President Reagan on October 1, 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe was the first chairman to serve under this new legislation.

==History==
The Goldwater–Nichols Act was an attempt to fix problems caused by inter-service rivalry, which had emerged during the Vietnam War, contributed to the catastrophic failure of the Iranian hostage rescue mission in 1980, and which were still evident in the invasion of Grenada in 1983.

Such problems existed as well in World War II, during which two independent lines of command flowed from the president, one through the secretary of the Navy to naval forces, and the other through the secretary of war to land and air forces. In 1947, the military restructuring placed all military forces, including the newly independent Air Force, under a single civilian secretary of defense.

However, the United States military was still organized along the lines of command that reported to their respective service chiefs (Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force, and Chief of Naval Operations). These service chiefs in turn made up the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs of Staff elected a chairman to communicate with the civilian government. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs in turn reported to the secretary of defense, the civilian head of the military. Both the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the secretary of defense reported to the president of the United States who holds the position of Commander-in-Chief (CINC) of all U.S. Armed Forces.

This system led to counter-productive inter-service rivalry. Peacetime activities (such as procurement and creation of doctrine, etc.) were tailored for each service in isolation. Additionally, wartime activities of each service were largely planned, executed, and evaluated independently. These practices resulted in division of effort and an inability to profit from economies of scale, and inhibited the development of modern warfare doctrine.

The formulation of the AirLand Battle doctrine in the late 1970s and early 1980s laid bare the difficulty of coordinating efforts among various service branches. AirLand Battle attempted to synthesize all of the capabilities of the service arms of the military into a single doctrine. The system envisioned ground, naval, air, and space based systems acting in concert to attack and defeat an opponent in depth. The structure of the armed forces effectively blocked realization of this ideal. The U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983 further exposed the problems with the military command structure. Although the United States forces easily prevailed, its leaders expressed major concerns over different service branches&#x27; inability to coordinate and communicate with each other and the consequences of a lack of coordination if faced with a more threatening foe.

==Effects==
The Goldwater–Nichols Act brought sweeping changes to the way the U.S. military forces were organized. The first successful test of Goldwater–Nichols was the 1989 United States invasion of Panama (code-named Operation Just Cause), where it functioned exactly as planned, allowing the U.S. commander, Army General Maxwell Reid Thurman, to exercise full control over Marine Corps, Army, Air Force and Navy assets without having to negotiate with the individual services.

===Chain of command and military advice===
Under the Goldwater–Nichols Act, military advice was centralized in the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as opposed to the service chiefs. The chairman was designated as the principal military adviser to the president of the United States, National Security Council and Secretary of Defense. The act also established the position of vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and simplified the chain of command. Additionally, the act states that the chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff cannot be representatives from the same service branch. It increased the ability of the chairman to direct overall strategy, but provided greater command authority to &quot;unified&quot; and &quot;specified&quot; field commanders. According to the act, the chairman &quot;may not exercise military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of the armed forces&quot;.

Section 162(b) of the act prescribes that &quot;unless otherwise directed by the president, the chain of command to a unified or specified combatant command runs—

# &quot;from the president to the secretary of defense,&quot; and
# &quot;from the secretary of defense to the commander of the combatant command&quot;.

===Interaction of services===
Goldwater–Nichols changed the way the services interact. The services themselves &quot;organize, train and equip&quot; forces for use by the combatant commanders (CCDRs), and the service chiefs no longer exercise any operational control over their forces. Rather than reporting to a service chief operationally, the service component forces support the commander responsible for a specific function (special operations, strategic, transportation, cyber) or a geographic region of the globe (Northern, Central, European, Pacific, Southern, Africa Commands), and Space. The combatant commanders then field a force capable of employing AirLand Battle doctrine (or its successors) using all assets available to the integrated unified action plan, including the military, interagency organizations of the US Government such as USAID and the Department of State, and intelligence agencies. The restructuring afforded a combination of effort, integrated planning, shared procurement, and a reduction or elimination of inter-service rivalry. It also provided unity of command, conforming with leading military science. Individual services changed from relatively autonomous war-fighting entities into organizational and training units, responsible for acquisition, modernization, force-development, and readiness as a component of the integrated force. Thus USCENTCOM (U.S. Central Command), for example, would be assigned air, ground, naval, Marine, space, and special operations assets to achieve its objectives, not the previously less efficient method of individual services planning, supporting, and fighting the same war. This was successfully demonstrated during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

===Personnel management of officers===
Another major effect of the Act is the way it has dramatically changed the personnel management of military officers. Many officers are assigned to joint duty positions (occasionally more than once), and are educated in Department of Defense Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) schools as part of their career development and progression. For example, in order to be competitive for promotion to general or flag officer (admiral) (pay grade O-7 or above/NATO OF-6), active component colonels (pay grade O-6/NATO OF-5) (Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force) or Navy captains must have completed at least one joint duty assignment, as well as having completed (or currently be enrolled in) a JPME school that grants JPME Level II credit.

===Shared procurement===
Shared procurement allowed the various branches to share technological advances such as stealth and smart weapons quickly, and provided other ancillary benefits (such as improved interoperability of radios and communications between units and members of different services). Joint implementation of new technology allowed for joint development of supporting doctrine. The Goldwater–Nichols Act could be seen as the initial step of the currently ongoing Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) with its concept of Network Centric Warfare (NCW).

==Changes since 1986==
On October 24, 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ordered that the functional and regional commanders be referred to not as &quot;CINCs&quot; but as &quot;combatant commanders&quot; when applied to &quot;unified&quot; regional organizations (e.g., USCENTCOM), or &quot;commander&quot; when talking about &quot;specified&quot; units such as the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). Rumsfeld said the term &quot;CINC&quot; was inappropriate, notwithstanding its employment for many decades, because under the United States Constitution, the president is the Nation&#x27;s only Commander-in-Chief. His decision was described as intending to clarify and strengthen the military&#x27;s subordination to civilian government.

On November 10, 2015, Senator John McCain announced at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the beginning of a new effort to &quot;reconsider, and possibly update&quot; Goldwater–Nichols.

On January 4, 2016, the deputy secretary of defense issued a memorandum directing an internal review with the objective &quot;to make recommendations for updates or adjustments to organizational relationships and authorities&quot; based on 30 years of experience under Goldwater–Nichols.

On April 5, 2016, Defense Secretary Ash Carter outlined reforms in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

<text>Włodawa () is a town in eastern Poland on the Bug River, close to the borders with Belarus and Ukraine. It is the seat of Włodawa County, situated in the Lublin Voivodeship. it has a population of 13,500.

==Geography==
The town lies along the borders of Poland with both, westernmost Belarus and Ukraine, on the banks of the Bug River, from Chełm in Poland and Brest in Belarus; from Terespol, from Lublin, and from Liuboml in the Volyn Oblast of Ukraine. It is close to the Belarusian southernmost strip of the Brest Raion within the Brest Region bordering with north-western Ukraine.

==History==

Włodawa was first mentioned in historical records in 1242. The first written mention of the town in an Old Slavonic chronicle which speaks about Prince Daniel staying there, escaping from the Tartars in 1241. In 1446-1447 the surrounding territories were annexed into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the river Włodawka marked the border between the Duchy and the Polish Crown within the Polish–Lithuanian Union. In 1475 Michał and Aleksander Sanguszko received the town in exchange with the Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon. For the next 100 years the town became the home for the Sanguszko family. They built their castle here and developed the town&#x27;s prosperity. The Sanguszko profited from the border crossing which was bringing good income. In 1534 the town received city rights, confirmed in 1540. At that time the influx of the Jewish population started, which promoted commerce and crafts. The location on the large river, Bug, favored the rapid development of the city as a commercial and transit center.

By the end of the 16th century, Włodawa passed into the hands of Andrzej Leszczyński and from that time belonged to the Leszczyński family for next generations. As Leszczyński was a Calvinist, Włodawa soon became an important center of Protestantism. In 1624 a Calvinist church and a school were built here. Between 1633 and 1648, the minister of the Calvinist congregation in Włodawa was Polish historian and poet Andrzej Węgierski. In 1634 a Calvinist synod was held in Włodawa, which was attended by delegates from the entire Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Protestants from Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia also settled in Włodawa at that time.
In 1648, the Cossack-Tatar army plundered and destroyed the city, killing almost the entire population, including all Jews. In 1657 the city was devastated again, this time by the Swedes during the Deluge. John III Sobieski and the subsequent Polish kings granted the right to four annual fairs. Horses and, above all, oxen from nearby Volhynia were sold at these fairs, with the latter being even sold to Kraków, Poznań, Berlin and Vienna. These fairs, as well as the staple right for salt contributed to Włodawa&#x27;s wealth. In the 17th century, Rafał Leszczyński, father of the future Polish King Stanisław Leszczyński, became the owner of Włodawa, but due to debts he sold it to Ludwik Pociej. Pociej brought the Paulines from the Jasna Góra Monastery in Częstochowa to Włodawa and built their monastery. In the 18th century, the city was the property of the Pociej, Flemming, Czartoryski and Zamoyski families.

After the Partitions of Poland, Włodawa was annexed by Austria in 1795. Following the Austro-Polish War of 1809, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it became part of Congress Poland, initially autonomous, but later forcibly integrated within Imperial Russia. The inhabitants of Włodawa actively joined the January Uprising in 1863. After the fall of the uprising, bloody repressions began and the attempts at Russification intensified. During World War I, from 1915 to 1918, the city was occupied by the Germans.

Following Poland&#x27;s return to independence, Włodawa became a seat of the Włodawa County. During the Polish–Soviet War, it was briefly occupied by the Russians, and then recaptured by the Poles on 17 August 1920. In 1939, before the onset of World War II, the population of Włodawa was 9,293. There was a garrison of heavy artillery regiment and the division of the field artillery in the town, used by the Pomorze and the Modlin armies in the defence of Poland against Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Włodawa was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 3 September 1939. Future Polish war hero Witold Pilecki fought against the invaders near Włodawa. Under German occupation, Włodawa was the location of a subcamp of the Stalag 319 prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs.

===Ethnic Minorities===
====Jewish community====

The existence of a Jewish community in Włodawa is first recorded in connection with the Lublin fair of 1531. By 1623 Włodawa had a representative in the Council of the Four Lands. The community&#x27;s prosperity was due to the granting of a city charter in 1534. For much of the early modern period, a time when the Polish-speaking community of the region was predominately engaged in agriculture, Jews appear to have composed much of the population of the city, engaged in all forms of craft production and trade. The community was devastated by the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648, but afterwards re-established and rebuilt. By 1765 the town had 630 Jews. In 1693, the town had 197 dwellings, 89 owned by Jewish families. The census of 1773 records Jewish physicians, butchers, millers, barbers, goldsmiths, tailors, furriers, merchants, and carters, in addition to one Jew in each of the trades of coppersmith, cobbler, glazier, chandler, and wheelwright. There were also 8 schoolmasters, 2 educators, a cantor, a bass player and a cymbal player. There were 2,236 Jews in 1827 and 6,706 in 1907.

In the late 19th century Włodawa had a Jewish-owned steam-powered flour mill, tannery and soap factory. Of the 184 stores in the town, 177 were owned by Jews. Włodawa&#x27;s first Zionist organization was formed in 1898, the town also had Bund, Agudath Israel and Poalei Zion organizations. There was a Beis Yaakov school for girls also.
Włodawa was over 70% Jewish before the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland and the Holocaust. The city became part of the Nazi German Lublin District of the General Government following the invasion. Włodawa Ghetto was set up by the German administration in 1941. Jews from all neighbouring locations were sent there. The Ghetto was overcrowded and lacked food and medicine. Starvation and disease were common. Round ups for the Holocaust transports to the nearby Sobibór extermination camp took place in waves: 1,300 Jews in May 1942, 5,400 in October, 2,800 in November 1942, and 2,000 in April 1943, as well as the last 150 in May 1943. In June, all remaining Jewish children under the age of 10 were deported and gassed. During the ghetto liquidation action, at the end of October 1942 hundreds of Jews escaped to the surrounding forests. Włodawa Jews were mostly deported to Sobibór, but some were executed locally at the German &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; workcamps such as the one at Adampol. Several Jews from Adampol and the Włodawa Ghetto were able to escape, and joined the Parczew partisans in the forests, fighting actively against the Nazis with Soviet assistance and weapons. The Jewish cemetery was demolished by the Germans who used the headstones as road building material, and turned the Synagogue into military storage.

On the road to Włodawa there is a memorial to the Jews from Włodawa who were killed at Adampol. No Jews are known to live in the town today, although the handsome, Baroque, Wlodawa Synagogue serves as major tourist attraction. A Włodawa landsmenschafte (society) was founded in America for survivors and descendants of Włodawa&#x27;s Jewish Community and has members scattered throughout the US, Canada, Australia, England, Israel and elsewhere. London had a Wlodawa Synagogue (London).

====Amish and Mennonite Communities====
In the 1700s, while some Amish families traveled west from Germany and Switzerland in their quest for religious freedom to the colony of Pennsylvania, others would venture to Central and Eastern Europe, largely as a part of the Josephine colonization. In 1781, Austrian emperor Joseph II invited German farmers to move to Galicia, after seizing the region (which today lies in southeastern Poland and Western Ukraine) in the First Partition of Poland. Other Amish however settled the vicinity of Włodawa, which was then still part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Nolt, A History of the Amish, p. 64-65).

Jerold A. Stahly writes of this community in the vicinity of Włodawa in his work &quot;Mennonite and Amish Identities Among the Swiss Volhynians in Europe&quot;:

&quot;In the Lithuanian congregation in Urszulin and Michelsdorf in the Włodawa district, one preacher was Christian Graber, ordained in 1790 in Montbeliard to go to Poland. Christian Stucky of Alsace served there as and elder from the 1790s to the 1830s. Graber, Stucky, and Johann Flickinger signed the Essingen agreement for this group. When Austria took control of the Włodawa district in 1795 as part of West Galicia, there was no longer an international border separating the Amish Mennonites in Lemberger and Littauer congregations. The Amish all apparently left Falkenstein and Einsiedel in the next few years. Joseph Mündlein apparently moved to the Włodawa District, where he served as an elder, performing a marriage in 1802. It was in 1804, during these years of Austrian rule that Josef Rohrer wrote about the Mennonites of West and East Galicia. He wrote that they preferred to be called Täufer. He said that one group of Mennonites was stricter and was called Heftler, because they used hooks and eyes on their clothes rather than buttons, like the other group, the Knöfler. He wrote that the strict ones wore bears. He described wives being very careful to avoid a friendly laugh or looking other men in the eye, for fear of being put under a ban for many weeks, so that no Mennonite would speak to her and her husband could not even sit at a table with her.&quot; 

==Climate==
Włodawa has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the isotherm.

<text>Ryki is a town in the Lublin Voivodeship in eastern Poland, capital of Ryki County. It has 9,767 inhabitants (as of 2007). It is situated between Warsaw and Lublin. Ryki belongs to Lesser Poland, and historically is part of &quot;Ziemia Stężycka&quot; (&quot;Land of Stężyca&quot;, an ancient county, the only part of historic Sandomierz Voivodeship which was located on the right bank of the Vistula river). The distance to the Polish capital is 100 km, the distance to Lublin – 64 km.

== History ==
The first urban center of this part of Lesser Poland was located in Sieciechów, whose parish church controlled areas both east and west of the Vistula. In the 14th century, Sieciechów&#x27;s significance diminished, and in the mid-15th century, the Stężyca County was created, as part of Sandomierz Voivodeship. The royal village of Ryki (Riki), which belonged to the County of Stężyca, was first mentioned in 1424. In 1570, Ryki had a wooden church of St. Jacob the Apostle, as well as a parish school. In 1591 a hospital was founded, and the seat of a starosta was established here. Ryki received its town charter in 1782 but lost it in 1810.
Until the Third Partition of Poland, Ryki remained in the Sandomierz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. Then, between 1795 and 1809, it briefly belonged to Austrian Empire’s province of West Galicia. After the Polish victory in Austro-Polish War of 1809, the town became part of the Duchy of Warsaw, later from 1815 Congress Poland, governed by the Russians. It was an important center of Chassidic movement, and in 1908, Jews made 94% of town&#x27;s population. On 2 August 1919 Ryki was added to Garwolin County, part of Lublin Voivodeship. Garwolin County became part of Warsaw Voivodeship on 1 April 1939.

In September 1939, at the start of World War II, German Luftwaffe destroyed the centre of Ryki. During the German occupation, the Jewish residents of the town—between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews—were murdered in the Holocaust, either in Treblinka extermination camp, or Sobibor extermination camp. Some Jewish children, such as Shloime Judensznajder (now Solly Irving), were rescued by Polish families. Their descendants live currently in Poland, the UK and Israel.

The town and its county was a major center of Home Army, whose units liberated Ryki on 26 July 1944. After the war, Ryki belonged to Warsaw Voivodeship, and in 1975, the town was moved again to Lublin Voivodeship. In 2000, FM- and TV-mast Ryki was built. Ryki again officially became a town in 1957.

Today Ryki is an important road junction. In the neighboring village of Moszczanka, two national roads cross – the 48th (Kock – Tomaszów Mazowiecki), and the 17th (Lublin – Warsaw). The town has a rail station, and bus connections with several locations.

== Famous namesakes ==
The surname of Hyman G. Rickover, a US Navy Admiral and considered the Father of the Nuclear Navy, is derived from Ryki. Born in 1900 in Maków Mazowiecki, the young Rickover emigrated with his Jewish family in 1906 to the United States. The Admiral served on active duty for 63 years, longer than any other U.S. military officer.

<text>Joseph Gerard Polchinski Jr. (; May 16, 1954 – February 2, 2018) was an American theoretical physicist and string theorist.

==Biography==
Polchinski was born in White Plains, New York, the elder of two children to Joseph Gerard Polchinski Sr. (1929–2002), a financial consultant and manager, and Joan (née Thornton), an office worker and homemaker. Polchinski was primarily of Irish descent with his paternal grandfather being Polish.

Polchinski graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in Tucson, Arizona, in 1971. He obtained his B.S. degree from Caltech in 1975, and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1980 under the supervision of Stanley Mandelstam. He did not publish any papers as a graduate student.
After postdoctoral positions at SLAC (1980–82) and Harvard (1982–84) he was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin from 1984 to 1992. From 1992 to March 2017 he was a professor in the Physics Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a permanent member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics there.

==Contributions==

Polchinski wrote the two-volume textbook &quot;String Theory&quot;, published in 1998. Among his many contributions to theoretical physics, D-branes are the best known. In 2008 he won the Dirac Medal for his work in superstring theory. He was awarded the 2017 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in recognition of his contributions to theoretical physics.

===D-branes===
Polchinski&#x27;s contributions to D-brane physics were a primary trigger of the 2nd superstring revolution and the physics of holographic gauge-gravity dualities. After co-discovering D-branes in 1989, his 1995 work conjectured and partially demonstrated the equivalence between D-branes and black p-branes. The duality between these objects was soon understood to be a demonstration of holography, in which a theory of quantum gravity (the black p-branes) is equivalent to a lower-dimensional theory without gravity (the D-branes), as later demonstrated in Maldacena&#x27;s AdS/CFT duality.

===Polchinski&#x27;s paradox===
In an unpublished communication to Kip Thorne circa 1990, commenting on the Novikov self-consistency principle (in relation to sending objects or people through a traversable wormhole into the past, and the time paradoxes that could result), Polchinski raised a potentially paradoxical situation involving a billiard ball sent through a wormhole which sends it back in time. In this scenario, the ball is fired into a wormhole at an angle such that, if it continues along that path, it will exit the wormhole in the past at just the right angle to collide with its earlier self, thereby knocking it off course and preventing it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne dubbed this problem &quot;Polchinski&#x27;s paradox&quot; in 1994. Later students of the whimsical problem came up with solutions which managed to avoid any inconsistencies, by having the ball emerge from the future at a different angle than the one used to generate the paradox, and deliver its younger self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole, a blow which changes its trajectory in just the right way so that it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self this glancing blow.
(It is also possible that the ball that exits the wormhole knocks its past self off course from the worm hole completely. Even with the original ball being knocked off course the future ball would still be there and could bounce off the original ball and enter the wormhole again closing the paradox. The ball that entered the wormhole will always enter the wormhole creating an infinite loop.) 

===2012 paper on black holes===

In July 2012, Polchinski, with two of his students, James Sully and Ahmed Almheiri, and fellow string theorist Donald Marolf at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), published a paper whose calculations about black hole radiation suggested that either general relativity&#x27;s equivalence principle is wrong, or else a key tenet of quantum mechanics is incorrect.

==In popular culture==
Polchinski was the subject of a running gag on an episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Paintball Scattering&quot;, Sheldon would choke up and be unable to respond every time anybody asked if the paper on super-symmetry, which he had recently published with his wife, Amy, was derivative of the work of Polchinski.

==Personal life and death==
Polchinski had two sons, Steven and Daniel, with his wife, Dorothy Maria Chun, whom he married in 1980.

He died at his home in Santa Barbara, California on February 2, 2018, of brain cancer, at the age of 63.

<text>Ksar el-Kebir (), also known as al-Qasr al-Kabir, is a city in northwestern Morocco, about 160 km north of Rabat, 32 km east of Larache and 110 km south of Tangier. It recorded a population of 126,617 in the 2014 Moroccan census.

The name means &quot;the big castle&quot;. The city is located nearby the Loukous river, making El-Ksar-el-Kebir one of Morocco&#x27;s richest agricultural regions. El-Ksar el-Kebir provides almost 20% of the needed sugar of Morocco.
Neighbouring cities and towns include Larache, Chefchaouen, Arbawa and Tateft.

==History==
It was first established as a Phoenician colony in the 1st millennium BC. Following the Punic Wars, it came under Roman control with the name &quot;Oppidum Novum&quot;.

In 1578, King Sebastian of Portugal suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir at the hands of the King Abd al-Malik of Morocco, which ended Portugal&#x27;s ambitions to invade and Christianize the Maghreb. Both kings died during the battle, as did Abdallah Mohammed, who was allied with Sebastian. The death of King Sebastian started the events which led to the temporary union of the crowns of Portugal and Spain under Philip II of Spain. King Abd al-Malik&#x27;s victory gave Morocco substantial strength and international prestige.

The city experienced substantial growth with the settling of a critical garrison in 1911 as a part of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. After Morocco&#x27;s independence and the Oued el Makhazine reservoir was built by King Hassan II to manage the Loukkos&#x27; river regime, the city became an important regional agricultural distribution center.

*12th century: According to Leo Africanus, city walls are built by the command of the Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur.
*1578: The Battle of Alcácer Quibir, or Battle of the Three Kings, is fought here.
*17th century: Sultan Moulay Ismail destroys the city walls of Ksar el-Kebir, after being angered by a local chief.
*1911: Spain conquered northern Morocco and the town was rebuilt and given a Spanish name, Alcazarquivir.
*1956: With Morocco&#x27;s independence, Alcazarquivir was transferred from Spanish control and renamed Ksar el-Kebir.

<text>Opole Lubelskie is a town in southeastern Poland. As of 2004, it had 8,879 inhabitants. The town is situated in Lublin Voivodeship, some 10 kilometers east of the Vistula River, and is the capital of Opole Lubelskie County. It was founded in the 14th century, and historically belongs to Lublin Land, which is part of Lesser Poland.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;opole&quot; comes from a Slavic language root, and designates a basic unit of Slavic tribal territory. Tribal organization, based on the &quot;opole&quot;, remained operative in Poland until the Middle Ages. There are several places named &quot;Opole&quot; in Poland, the best known being in Upper Silesia. To distinguish between these two, the adjective &quot;Lubelskie&quot; was added to the name of the town that is located near the city of Lublin.

==History==

The first wooden church in Opole Lubelskie was probably built in the 12th century. In 1368, by decree of King Casimir III the Great, Opole received Środa municipal rights, which was confirmed in documents issued in 1419. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Opole Lubelskie was one of centers of Reformation in Poland. Several Calvinists were active here. In 1625, a hospital was built outside the town, along the road to Sandomierz. Between 1663 and 1675, a new parish church was constructed, which still stands. In the mid 18th century, Opole Lubelskie prospered, after Piarists came here upon request of Jan Tarło, who also rebuilt the Słupecki Palace (now Lubomirski Palace) in the baroque style.

A new hospital and schools were built, the church was expanded and a monastery was opened. In the late 18th century, Rozalia Lubomirska spent a few years in the palace of her husband Aleksander, located in the village of Niezdów, near Opole Lubelskie.

Jews first arrived in the town in the sixteenth century. During the Cossack riots of the seventeenth century, many Jews of Opole were murdered and their property looted. Jews later returned to the town, and in the eighteenth century the town had a synagogue, a cemetery, and an entire Hasidic dynasty. The twentieth century brought change to the community. In addition to the Agudat Israel ultra-orthodox movement and a Beit Ya’akov school for orthodox girls, Zionist groups and secular youth movements, such as Hashomer Hatzair and Beitar, were founded in town. Before the German occupation of World War II, 4,325 Jews lived in Opole Lubelskie, comprising more than two thirds of the population. In September 1939 Opole was occupied by the Germans and the Polish population of the city immediately looted Jewish property.

From the beginning of the war, the Germans brutalized, robbed, and humiliated the Jewish population. On 15 February 1941 and 26 February 1941, two deportation transports with 2,003 Jewish men, women and children on board left Vienna Aspang Station for the ghetto which had been set up in Opole Lubelskie. By March 1941, 8,000 Jews lived in Opole Lubelskie, including the native population, the Austrians, and others from nearby communities such as Kazimierz Dolny and Puławy. Jews from France and Slovakia were also brought here. Crowding in the ghetto was intense with between seven and ten people living in each room. The crowding and lack of indoor plumbing and fresh water led to a typhus epidemic in the winter of 1941 from which hundreds died. From May 1941, men and women capable of work were deployed as forced labourers in Dęblin, Golab, Józefów, and elsewhere. Some worked in the residences, offices, and mess halls of German officials and police.

The German authorities killed several dozen hospital patients in July 1941 and raped and murdered Jewish teenagers in 1942. The mass murder of residents of the ghetto began in the spring of 1942. Hundreds of Jews were brought there and then sent on to killing or labor camps. Transports began in March with one to Belzec extermination camp on 31 March 1942 and deportations to the Sobibor extermination camp followed in May and October 1942. The last transport may have included most local Jews. Women and children rode in horse-drawn carts driven by local farmers; men walked. At Strzelce, a transit camp, they were put on trains to Sobibor where they were immediately murdered. Of the 2,003 Viennese Jews, only twenty-eight are known to have survived. The number of Opole Jews who survived is unknown.

Today Opole Lubelskie is home to one of the most modern prison in Poland - &quot;Zakład Karny Opole Lubelskie&quot;, which was opened in October 2009.

==Sights==

Among points of interest there are the parish Church of Saint Mary (1663-1675, expanded 1748), the complex of the Piarist Monastery, the Lubomirski Palace (today it houses a high school), the town hall (1750), tenement houses and the cemetery chapel (1790). The cemetery itself was opened in 1772.

==Cuisine==
Among the protected traditional local foods, as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, are:
* &quot;Wędzone dzwonka karpia z Pustelni&quot;, pieces of smoked carp, produced in a traditional way, without artificial preservatives, in the nearby settlement of Pustelnia, a traditional dish of the area.
* &quot;Masło z Opola Lubelskiego&quot;, local butter.

==Sports==
The local football club is Opolanin Opole Lubelskie. It competes in the lower leagues.

==Twin towns==
Opole Lubelskie is twinned with:

* Mikóháza, Hungary
* Hamme, Belgium
* Sokal, Ukraine
* Racalmuto, Italy

<doc id="644646" wikidata="Q1129046" url="?curid=644646" title="Alexithymia">
<text>Alexithymia, also called emotional blindness, is a neuropsychological phenomenon characterized by significant challenges in recognizing, expressing, feeling, sourcing, and describing one&#x27;s emotions. It is associated with difficulties in attachment and interpersonal relations. There is no scientific consensus on its classification as a personality trait, medical symptom, or mental disorder. 

Alexithymia occurs in approximately 10% of the population and often co-occurs with various mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. It is present in 50% to 85% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Difficulty in recognizing and discussing emotions may manifest at low levels in men who conform to specific cultural norms of masculinity, such as the belief that sadness is a feminine emotion. This condition, known as &quot;normative male alexithymia&quot;, can be present in both sexes.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;alexithymia&quot; was introduced by psychotherapists John Case Nemiah and Peter Sifneos in 1970 to describe a particular psychological phenomenon. Its etymology comes from Ancient Greek. The word is formed by combining the alpha privative prefix (, meaning &#x27;not&#x27;) with (, referring to &#x27;words&#x27;) and (, denoting &#x27;disposition,&#x27; &#x27;feeling,&#x27; or &#x27;rage&#x27;). The term can be likened to &quot;dyslexia&quot; in its structure.

In its literal sense, &quot;alexithymia&quot; signifies &quot;impermeable to emotions&quot;. This label reflects the difficulty experienced by individuals with this condition in recognizing, expressing, and articulating their emotional experiences. Nonmedical terminology, such as &quot;emotionless&quot; and &quot;impassive&quot;, has also been employed to describe similar states. Those who exhibit alexithymic traits or characteristics are commonly referred to as &quot;alexithymics&quot; or &quot;alexithymiacs&quot;.

==Classification==
, scholars have not reached a consensus about the classification of alexithymia. The DSM-5 and the ICD-11 classify alexithymia as neither a symptom nor a mental disorder. Cognitive behavioral and psychoanalytic theorists have proposed conceptualizations, including lists of characteristic signs and symptoms.
=== Cognitive behavioral model ===
The cognitive behavioral model, also known as the attention-appraisal model, proposes three descriptive components:

# difficulty identifying feelings (DIF)
# difficulty describing feelings (DDF)
# externally oriented thinking (EOT), characterized by a tendency to not focus attention on emotions.

=== Psychoanalytic model ===
The psychoanalytic model suggests four components:
# difficulty identifying feelings (DIF)
# difficulty describing feelings to other people (DDF)
# a stimulus-bound, externally oriented thinking style (EOT)
# constricted imaginal processes (IMP) characterized by infrequent daydreaming
Constricted imaginal processes, defined as a lack of spontaneous imagining, does not correlate with the other components. Such findings have led to ongoing debate in the field about whether IMP is indeed a component of alexithymia. For example, in 2017, Preece and colleagues introduced the attention-appraisal model of alexithymia, where they suggested that IMP be removed from the definition and that alexithymia be conceptually composed only of DIF, DDF, and EOT, as each of these three are specific to deficits in emotion processing. These core differences in the definition of alexithymia, regarding the inclusion or exclusion of IMP, correspond to differences between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of alexithymia; whereby psychoanalytic formulations tend to continue to place importance on IMP, whereas the attention-appraisal model (presently the most widely used cognitive-behavioral model of alexithymia) excludes IMP from the construct. In practice, since the constricted imaginal processes items were removed from earlier versions of the TAS-20 in the 1990s, the most used alexithymia assessment tools (and consequently most alexithymia research studies) have only assessed the construct in terms of DIF, DDF, and EOT. In terms of the relevance of alexithymic deficits for the processing of negative (e.g., sadness) or positive (e.g., happiness) emotions, the PAQ is presently the only alexithymia measure that enables valence-specific assessments of alexithymia across both negative and positive emotions; recent work with the PAQ has highlighted that alexithymic deficits in emotion processing do often extend across both negative and positive emotions, although people typically report more difficulties for negative emotions. Such findings of valence-specific effects in alexithymia are also supported by brain imaging studies.

Studies (using measures of alexithymia assessing DIF, DDF, and EOT) have reported that the prevalence rate of high alexithymia is less than 10% of the population. A less common finding suggests that there may be a higher prevalence of alexithymia amongst males than females, which may be accounted for by difficulties some males have with &quot;describing feelings&quot;, but not by difficulties in &quot;identifying feelings&quot;, in which males and females show similar abilities. Work with the PAQ has suggested that the alexithymia construct manifests similarly across different cultural groups, and those of different ages (i.e., has the same structure and components).

Psychologist R. Michael Bagby and psychiatrist Graeme J. Taylor have argued that the alexithymia construct is inversely related to the concepts of psychological mindedness and emotional intelligence and there is &quot;strong empirical support for alexithymia being a stable personality trait rather than just a consequence of psychological distress&quot;.

== Assessment ==
Alexithymia is most commonly assessed using self-report questionnaires, such as the Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire (PAQ) or 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). These tools assess the DIF, DDF, and EOT components of alexithymia. Studies that have directly compared these measures have consistently found the PAQ to be the best performing psychometrically, with strong evidence for it providing a comprehensive and reliable alexithymia profile. The TAS-20 is an older measure (introduced in 1994, compared to the PAQ in 2018) and is also still used, though recent studies have highlighted a number of validity and reliability concerns with the TAS-20, such as parts of the measure having low reliability, and parts being confounded by how distressed respondents currently are (i.e., measuring distress rather than alexithymia). Several observer-rated or interview-based measures of alexithymia also exist, but so far these have been rarely used in research or clinical settings due to long administration times.

==Signs and symptoms==
Typical deficiencies may include problems identifying, processing, describing, and working with one&#x27;s own feelings, often marked by a lack of understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal. Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of dreams more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.

Some alexithymic individuals may appear to contradict the above-mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic dysphoria or manifest outbursts of crying or rage. However, questioning usually reveals that they are quite incapable of describing their feelings or appear confused by questions inquiring about specifics of feelings.

According to Henry Krystal, individuals exhibiting alexithymia think in an operative way and may appear to be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals can, but not always, seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.

A common misconception about alexithymia is that affected individuals are totally unable to express emotions verbally and that they may even fail to acknowledge that they experience emotions. Even before coining the term, Sifneos (1967) noted patients often mentioned things like anxiety or depression. The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;unhappy&quot; when describing these feelings. The core issue is that people with alexithymia have poorly differentiated emotions, limiting their ability to distinguish and describe them to others. This contributes to the sense of emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with others, making alexithymia negatively associated with life satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors are controlled for.

===Associated conditions===
Alexithymia frequently co-occurs with other disorders. Research indicates that alexithymia overlaps with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In a 2004 study using the TAS-20, 85% of the adults with ASD fell into the &quot;impaired&quot; category and almost half fell into the &quot;severely impaired&quot; category; in contrast, among the adult control population only 17% were &quot;impaired&quot;, none &quot;severely impaired&quot;. Fitzgerald &amp; Bellgrove pointed out that, &quot;Like alexithymia, Asperger&#x27;s syndrome is also characterised by core disturbances in speech and language and social relationships&quot;. Note that, Asperger&#x27;s syndrome has been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is no longer a diagnosis in the WHO&#x27;s ICD-11 or the APA&#x27;s DSM-5-TR. Hill &amp; Berthoz agreed with Fitzgerald &amp; Bellgrove (2006) and in response stated that &quot;there is some form of overlap between alexithymia and ASDs&quot;. They also pointed to studies that revealed impaired theory of mind skill in alexithymia, neuroanatomical evidence pointing to a shared etiology, and similar social skills deficits. The exact nature of the overlap is uncertain. Alexithymic traits in AS may be linked to clinical depression or anxiety; the mediating factors are unknown and it is possible that alexithymia predisposes to anxiety. On the other hand, while the total alexithymia score as well as the difficulty in identifying feelings and externally oriented thinking factors are found to be significantly associated with ADHD, and while the total alexithymia score, the difficulty in identifying feelings, and the difficulty in describing feelings factors are also significantly associated with symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, there is no significant relationship between alexithymia and inattentiveness.

There are many more psychiatric disorders that overlap with alexithymia. One study found that 41% of US veterans of the Vietnam War with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were alexithymic. Another study found higher levels of alexithymia among Holocaust survivors with PTSD compared to those without. Higher levels of alexithymia among mothers with interpersonal violence-related PTSD were found in one study to have proportionally less caregiving sensitivity. This latter study suggested that when treating adult PTSD patients who are parents, alexithymia should be assessed and addressed also with attention to the parent-child relationship and the child&#x27;s social-emotional development.

Single study prevalence findings for other disorders include 63% in anorexia nervosa, 56% in bulimia, 45% to 50% in major depressive disorder, 34% in panic disorder, 28% in social phobia, and 50% in substance abusers. Alexithymia is also exhibited by a large proportion of individuals with acquired brain injuries such as stroke or traumatic brain injury.

Alexithymia is correlated with certain personality disorders, particularly schizoid, avoidant, dependent and schizotypal, substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders and sexual disorders as well as certain physical illnesses, such as hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and functional dyspepsia. Alexithymia is further linked with disorders such as migraine headaches, lower back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, nausea, allergies and fibromyalgia. There is a positive relationship between alexithymia and non-suicidal self-injury.

An inability to modulate emotions is a possibility in explaining why some people with alexithymia are prone to discharge tension arising from unpleasant emotional states through impulsive acts or compulsive behaviors such as binge eating, substance abuse, perverse sexual behavior or anorexia nervosa. The failure to regulate emotions cognitively might result in prolonged elevations of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and neuroendocrine systems, which can lead to somatic diseases. People with alexithymia also show a limited ability to experience positive emotions leading Krystal and Sifneos (1987) to describe many of these individuals as anhedonic.

Alexisomia is a clinical concept that refers to the difficulty in the awareness and expression of somatic, or bodily, sensations. The concept was first proposed in 1979 by Yujiro Ikemi when he observed characteristics of both alexithymia and alexisomia in patients with psychosomatic diseases.

==Causes==
It is unclear what causes alexithymia, though several theories have been proposed.

Early studies showed evidence that there may be an interhemispheric transfer deficit among people with alexithymia; that is, the emotional information from the right hemisphere of the brain is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased corpus callosum, often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse. A neuropsychological study in 1997 indicated that alexithymia may be due to a disturbance to the right hemisphere of the brain, which is largely responsible for processing emotions. In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that alexithymia may be related to a dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex. These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the neural mechanisms behind alexithymia remains inconclusive.

French psychoanalyst Joyce McDougall objected to the strong focus by clinicians on neurophysiological explanations at the expense of psychological ones for the genesis and operation of alexithymia, and introduced the alternative term &quot;disaffectation&quot; to stand for psychogenic alexithymia. For McDougall, the disaffected individual had at some point &quot;experienced overwhelming emotion that threatened to attack their sense of integrity and identity&quot;, to which they applied psychological defenses to pulverize and eject all emotional representations from consciousness. A similar line of interpretation has been taken up using the methods of phenomenology. McDougall has also noted that all infants are born unable to identify, organize, and speak about their emotional experiences (the word &quot;infans&quot; is from the Latin &quot;not speaking&quot;), and are &quot;by reason of their immaturity inevitably alexithymic&quot;. Based on this fact McDougall proposed in 1985 that the alexithymic part of an adult personality could be &quot;an extremely arrested and infantile psychic structure&quot;. The first language of an infant is nonverbal facial expressions. The parent&#x27;s emotional state is important for determining how any child might develop. Neglect or indifference to varying changes in a child&#x27;s facial expressions without proper feedback can promote an invalidation of the facial expressions manifested by the child. The parent&#x27;s ability to reflect self-awareness to the child is another important factor. If the adult is incapable of recognizing and distinguishing emotional expressions in the child, it can influence the child&#x27;s capacity to understand emotional expressions.

The attention-appraisal model of alexithymia by Preece and colleagues describes the mechanisms behind alexithymia within a cognitive-behavioral framework. Within this model, it is specified that alexithymia levels are due to the developmental level of people&#x27;s emotion schemas (those cognitive structures used to process emotions) and/or the extent to which people are avoiding their emotions as an emotion regulation strategy. There is a large body of evidence currently supporting the specifications of this model.

Molecular genetic research into alexithymia remains minimal, but promising candidates have been identified from studies examining connections between certain genes and alexithymia among those with psychiatric conditions as well as the general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found higher scores on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale among those with the 5-HTTLPR homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the serotonin transporter gene influences the transcription of the serotonin transporter that removes serotonin from the synaptic cleft, and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders. Another study examining the 5-HT1A receptor, a receptor that binds serotonin, found higher levels of alexithymia among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 polymorphism within the HTR1A gene. Also, a study examining alexithymia in subjects with obsessive–compulsive disorder found higher alexithymia levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the Rs4680 polymorphism in the gene that encodes Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with alexithymia.

Although there is evidence for the role of environmental and neurological factors, the role and influence of genetic factors for developing alexithymia is still unclear. A single large scale Danish study suggested that genetic factors contributed noticeably to the development of alexithymia. However, some scholars find twin studies and the entire field of behavior genetics to be controversial. Those scholars raise concerns about the &quot;equal environments assumption&quot;. Traumatic brain injury is also implicated in the development of alexithymia, and those with traumatic brain injury are six times more likely to exhibit alexithymia. Alexithymia is also associated with newborn circumcision trauma.

==Relationships==
Alexithymia can create interpersonal problems because these individuals tend to avoid emotionally close relationships, or if they do form relationships with others they usually position themselves as either dependent, dominant, or impersonal, &quot;such that the relationship remains superficial&quot;. Inadequate &quot;differentiation&quot; between self and others by alexithymic individuals has also been observed. Their difficulty in processing interpersonal connections often develops where the person lacks a romantic partner.

In a study, a large group of alexithymic individuals completed the 64-item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64) which found that &quot;two interpersonal problems are significantly and stably related to alexithymia: cold/distant and non-assertive social functioning. All other IIP-64 subscales were not significantly related to alexithymia.&quot;

Chaotic interpersonal relations have also been observed by Sifneos. Due to the inherent difficulties identifying and describing emotional states in self and others, alexithymia also negatively affects relationship satisfaction between couples.

In a 2008 study alexithymia was found to be correlated with impaired understanding and demonstration of relational affection, and that this impairment contributes to poorer mental health, poorer relational well-being, and lowered relationship quality.

Some individuals working for organizations in which control of emotions is the norm might show alexithymic-like behavior but not be alexithymic. However, over time the lack of self-expressions can become routine and they may find it harder to identify with others.

==Treatment==
Generally speaking, approaches to treating alexithymia are still in their infancy, with not many proven treatment options available.

In 2002, Kennedy and Franklin found that a skills-based intervention is an effective method for treating alexithymia. Kennedy and Franklin&#x27;s treatment plan involved giving the participants a series of questionnaires, psychodynamic therapies, cognitive-behavioral and skills-based therapies, and experiential therapies. After treatment, they found that participants were generally less ambivalent about expressing their emotion feelings and more attentive to their emotional states.

In 2017, based on their attention-appraisal model of alexithymia, Preece and colleagues recommended that alexithymia treatment should try to improve the developmental level of people&#x27;s emotion schemas and reduce people&#x27;s use of experiential avoidance of emotions as an emotion regulation strategy (i.e., the mechanisms hypothesized to underlie alexithymia difficulties in the attention-appraisal model of alexithymia).

In 2018, Löf, Clinton, Kaldo, and Rydén found that mentalisation-based treatment is also an effective method for treating alexithymia. Mentalisation is the ability to understand the mental state of oneself or others that underlies overt behavior, and mentalisation-based treatment helps patients separate their own thoughts and feelings from those around them. This treatment is relational, and it focuses on gaining a better understanding and use of mentalising skills. The researchers found that all of the patients&#x27; symptoms including alexithymia significantly improved, and the treatment promoted affect tolerance and the ability to think flexibly while expressing intense affect rather than impulsive behavior.

A significant issue impacting alexithymia treatment is that alexithymia has comorbidity with other disorders. Mendelson&#x27;s 1982 study showed that alexithymia frequently presented in people with undiagnosed chronic pain. Participants in Kennedy and Franklin&#x27;s study all had anxiety disorders in conjunction with alexithymia, while those in Löf et al. were diagnosed with both alexithymia and borderline personality disorder. All these comorbidity issues complicate treatment because it is difficult to find people who exclusively have alexithymia.

<text>Janów Lubelski is a town in southeastern Poland. It has 11,938 inhabitants (2006). Situated in the Lublin Voivodship, Janów Lubelski belongs to Lesser Poland, and is located in southeastern corner of this historic Polish province. It is the capital of Janów Lubelski County. It has a large hospital (Samodzielny Publiczny Zespół Zakładów Opieki Zdrowotnej). It also has several tourist attractions, including buildings and churches from the 17th and 18th centuries. Janów Lubelski is home to the Open-air museum of the Forest Railway in Janów Lubelski

The town lies on the edge of Roztocze, on the Białka river, and its area is 14.80 square kilometers. South of Janów there is the extensive Solska Forest. The town is located at the intersection of two national roads: the 19th (Rzeszów – Lublin – Białystok – Grodno), and the 74th (Hrubieszów – Zamość – Kraśnik – Kielce – Piotrków Trybunalski). The distance to Lublin is 70 kilometers, and to Rzeszów, 90 kilometers.

==History==

The history of Janów Lubelski dates back to the 12th century, when first human settlements appeared in Sandomierz Forest. Over time, the number of villages grew, and a busy merchant road was constructed from Zamość to Sandomierz. In the first half of the 17th century, local noblewoman Katarzyna Zamoyska (see: Zamoyski family) decided to found a town along the road. On July 21, 1640, King Władysław IV Vasa issued a royal privilege, agreeing to found the town of Biała with Magdeburg Rights. The coat of arms of the new town presented Saint Mary, and to build houses, the area located southwest of the Biała river was chosen. The name Janów appeared a few years later. It comes from the first name &quot;Jan&quot; (&quot;John&quot;), and commemorates Jan Zamoyski, the son of Katarzyna Zamoyska. In a similar fashion, the towns of Klemensów (now a district of Szczebrzeszyn) and Tomaszów Lubelski were named.

In 1648 Janów was captured and burned by the Cossacks of Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Four years later, the population was decimated by diseases. As a result, Jan Zamoyski, who wanted to rebuild Janów, allowed the first Jewish settlers in the town (1652). In 1653, Tatars loyal to Poland came to Janów and decided to settle here as well. In 1660, Dominicans were invited to Janów, to a church and a monastery which had been funded by the Zamoyski family. The boundaries of the town were soon extended, and in the late 17th century, Janów had ca. 1,000 residents, with several artisans. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Janów was annexed by Austria. In 1807 it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution, in 1815, it was transferred to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. At that time it had some 2,000 residents, and in 1804, a great fire destroyed 71 houses. The number of residents declined, so the Zamoyski family decided to bring cloth makers from Silesia, who settled in a district called Sukiennia. After the November Uprising, the border between Austria and the Russian Empire was closed, which resulted in the collapse of cloth-making enterprises.

In the early 19th century, Russian authorities created &quot;Zamość County&quot;, with the capital in Zamość. Soon afterwards, however, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia demanded that Zamość should remain a militarized city (see Zamość Fortress), and civilian authorities (police, courts, criminal prison) moved between 1817 and 1827 to Janów. Due to this fact, the town quickly grew; the so-called &quot;New Town&quot; was founded, and in 1820, a municipal park was opened. In 1834 Janów was divided into three parts: &quot;Stare Miasto&quot; (&quot;Old Town&quot;), &quot;Nowe Miasto&quot; (&quot;New Town&quot;), and &quot;Przedmieście Zaolszynie&quot; (&quot;The Suburb of Zaolszynie&quot;). In 1841, an Eastern Orthodox church was built for Russian troops stationed in Janów, and by the mid-19th century, the population grew to 3,500. In 1860, Janów had 2 hotels, a pharmacy, 4 inns, a school, a number of cloth-making enterprises, and 12 public houses. Main streets and the market square were paved; there was a hospital (1867) and a tannery. After the January Uprising, many residents of the town and the county were sent to katorga in Siberia, and the Dominican monastery was appropriated by Russian authorities.
At the beginning of the 20th century Janów had 8,000 inhabitants. During World War I, the town was the area of heavy fighting, and in 1922, after Poland had regained independence, almost half of houses burned in a fire. Janów began to grow after 1925, when additional streets were paved, 7 bridges were built, and a middle school was completed. In 1934 it had two saw mills, a mill, a brewery, and a slaughterhouse. A local power plant provided electricity, there were 339 artisans, a hospital, a senior citizen center and several civic organizations, such as Riflemen&#x27;s Association.

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, in September 1939, Janów was three times bombed by the Luftwaffe, which killed 350 people and destroyed 85% of the town. The town was afterwards occupied by Germany. At least 17 Poles from the county were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940, while in June 1940, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Poles during the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;. Arrested Poles were imprisoned in Lublin, and then often deported to the Sachsenhausen and Auschwitz concentration camps, while some were murdered during large massacres of Poles committed in Rury, Lublin. A forced labour camp was opened in 1940, and the town&#x27;s Jewish population was persecuted by the occupiers. Several Jewish partisan groups operated in the Janów forests for the duration of the war. Despite this, only around 20 Jews from the town survived the Holocaust out of 3,500 to 5,000 Jews who lived in the town before the war.

Soviet and Polish troops captured Janów on July 26, 1944, and afterwards the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. In April 1945, units of the Home Army attacked the local prison, freeing resistance fighters from Warsaw, who were kept there. Near Janów, the Battle of Porytowe Wzgórze took place.
In 1956 Janów County was re-created, and in the 1960s the town grew, due to several new factories built there. The number of inhabitants grew, new districts were created, a new hospital was opened, as well as kindergartens, post office, and a municipal stadium.

From 1975 to 1998, Janów belonged to Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship.

==Sights and culture==
Janów is home to two local museums and the Baroque Saint Mary of Rosary Sanctuary, located in the former Dominican monastery (1694–1769). The world&#x27;s oldest monument dedicated to Tadeusz Kościuszko, dating back to 1818, is located in the town. The town is surrounded by forests.

===Cuisine===
Janów Lubelski with its surroundings is known for its traditional foods and drinks, often based on honey, buckwheat, cereals and potatoes, traditionally grown and produced in the region. Among those foods and drinks are &quot;gryczak janowski&quot;, buckwheat honey and honey nalewka, all of which are protected traditional regional foods, as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

&quot;Gryczak janowski&quot; is a traditional local cake made of buckwheat and millet kasza with cheese and smetana. It is served hot or cold, and is considered a dish of high nutritional, medicinal and dietetic values.

Buckwheat honey is popular throughout the Lublin Region, including Janów Lubelski. Rich in magnesium, iron, vitamin C and protein, it is used to treat a wide range of diseases.

&quot;Janowska nalewka miodowa&quot; (honey nalewka of Janów) is a local type of nalewka, a traditional Polish alcoholic drink. It is of 50% alcohol by volume.

==Economy==
The &quot;Browar Janów Lubelski&quot; brewery is located in the town.

<doc id="644652" wikidata="Q5689799" url="?curid=644652" title="Headlines (Jay Leno)">
<text>Headlines was a segment that aired weekly on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. It also aired on the prime-time spin-off &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. The segment usually aired on Monday nights. It was first seen in 1987, when Leno was still a guest host on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and continued (even after Leno became permanent host in 1992) until Jay Leno left &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 2014.

This segment reappeared on TV as part of a new version of the game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; hosted by Leno beginning in 2021. Viewers submitted newspaper headlines or other articles from all over the world, and the clippings contain either (but not limited to) a misspelled word, juxtaposed image or badly structured sentences that comically (and often in an unintentionally risqué way) completely change the meaning of what the writer intended.

==Influence==
On December 18, 2006, an item in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; about David Letterman, which included a photograph of Leno, was included on both Headlines and on Small Town News, a segment with a similar conceit on Letterman&#x27;s &quot;Late Show&quot;.

In January 2010, during the replacement of O&#x27;Brien as &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host, Letterman ran a fake promo (featuring former &quot;Tonight&quot; announcer Edd Hall) for the return of Leno to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, referring to &quot;Headlines&quot; as &quot;the bit [Leno] stole from Letterman&#x27;s late-night show&quot;.

==Publications==
Leno released several compilations of Headlines during the late 1980s and early 1990s:
*&quot;Headlines: Real but Ridiculous Headlines from America&#x27;s Newspapers&quot;
*&quot;More Headlines&quot;
*&quot;Headlines III: Not The Movie, Still The Book&quot;
*&quot;Headlines IV: The Next Generation&quot;
*&quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Police Blotter: Real-Life Crime Headlines&quot;
All profits from sale of the books went to charity, most notably the Samuel Jared Kushnick Foundation.

Wil B. Strange includes &quot;personal ads from the book &#x27;Jay Leno&#x27;s Headlines&#x27;&quot; in an issue of &quot;Campus Life&quot;.

<text>Stephen Heller (15 May 181314 January 1888) was a Hungarian pianist, teacher, and composer whose career spanned the period from Schumann to Bizet. Heller was an influence for later Romantic composers. He outlived his reputation, and was a near-forgotten figure at his death in 1888.

==Biography==
Heller was born in Pest, Hungary in 1813. He had been destined for a legal career, but instead decided to devote his life to music. At the age of nine he performed Jan Ladislav Dussek&#x27;s Concerto for Two Pianos with his teacher, Franz Brauer, at the Budapest Theater. He played so well that he was sent to study in Vienna, Austria, under Carl Czerny. Unable to afford Czerny&#x27;s expensive fees, he became a student of . After a success in his first public concert in Vienna at the age of 15, his father undertook a concert tour through Hungary, Poland and Germany.

Heller returned to Budapest by way of Kassel, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, Hamburg, and Augsburg. After passing the winter of 1829 at Hamburg, he was taken ill at Augsburg in the summer of 1830. He abandoned the tour there and was soon afterwards adopted by a wealthy patron of music.

At the age of 25, he travelled to Paris, where he became closely acquainted with Hector Berlioz, Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt and other renowned composers of his era. Here Heller achieved distinction both as a concert performer and as a teacher. He taught piano to Isidor Philipp, who later became head of the piano department of the Conservatoire de Paris.

In 1849 Heller performed in England, where in 1850 he was the subject of a long serial article (that is divided between many issues) devoted to his music in the British &quot;Musical World&quot;. In 1862 he performed Mozart&#x27;s E-flat concerto for two pianos with Charles Hallé at The Crystal Palace.

He spent the last twenty-five years of his life in Paris.

== Works ==

Heller was a prolific composer for the piano and his studies remain popular with music teachers and students.

<text>Pixels per inch (ppi) and pixels per centimetre (ppcm or pixels/cm) are measurements of the pixel density of an electronic image device, such as a computer monitor or television display, or image digitizing device such as a camera or image scanner. Horizontal and vertical density are usually the same, as most devices have square pixels, but differ on devices that have non-square pixels. Pixel density is not the same as where the former describes the amount of detail on a physical surface or device, the latter describes the amount of pixel information regardless of its scale. Considered in another way, a pixel has no inherent size or unit (a pixel is actually a sample), but when it is printed, displayed, or scanned, then the pixel has both a physical size (dimension) and a pixel density (ppi).

== Basic principles ==
Since most digital hardware devices use dots or pixels, the size of the media (in inches) and the number of pixels (or dots) are directly related by the &#x27;pixels per inch&#x27;. The following formula gives the number of pixels, horizontally or vertically, given the physical size of a format and the &quot;pixels per inch&quot; of the output:

:formula_1

Pixels per inch (or pixels per centimetre) describes the &quot;detail&quot; of an image file when the print size is known. For example, a 100×100 pixel image printed in a 2 inch square has a resolution of 50 pixels per inch. Used this way, the measurement is meaningful when printing an image. In many applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, the program is designed so that one creates new images by specifying the output device and PPI (pixels per inch). Thus the output target is often defined upon creating the image.

== Outputting to a different device ==
When moving images between devices, such as printing an image that was created on a monitor, it is important to understand the pixel density of both devices. Consider a 23″ HD monitor (20″ wide), that has a known, native resolution of 1920 pixels (horizontal). Let us assume an artist created a new image at this monitor resolution of 1920 pixels, possibly intended for the web without regard to printing. Rewriting the formula above can tell us the pixel density (PPI) of the image on the monitor display:
:formula_2

Now, let us imagine the artist wishes to print a larger banner at 48″ horizontally. We know the number of pixels in the image, and the size of the output, from which we can use the same formula again to give the PPI of the printed poster:
:formula_3

This shows that the output banner will have only 40 pixels per inch. Since a printer device is capable of printing at 300 ppi, the resolution of the original image is well below what would be needed to create a decent quality banner, even if it looked good on a monitor for a website. We would say more directly that a 1920 × 1080 pixel image does not have enough pixels to be printed in a large format.

== Printing on paper ==
Printing on paper is accomplished with different technologies. Newspapers and magazines were traditionally printed using a halftone screen, which would print dots at a given frequency, the screen frequency, in lines per inch (LPI) by using a purely analog process in which a photographic print is converted into variable sized dots through interference patterns passing through a screen. Modern inkjet printers can print microscopic dots at any location, and don&#x27;t require a screen grid, with the metric dots per inch (DPI). These are both different from pixel density or pixels per inch (PPI) because a pixel is a single sample of any color, whereas an inkjet print can only print a dot of a specific color either on or off. Thus a printer translates the pixels into a series of dots using a process called dithering. The dot pitch, smallest size of each dot, is also determined by the type of paper the image is printed on. An absorbent paper surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets spread — so has a larger dot pitch.

Often one wishes to know the image quality in pixels per inch (PPI) that would be suitable for a given output device. If the choice is too low, then the quality will be below what the device is capable of—loss of quality—and if the choice is too high then pixels will be stored unnecessarily—wasted disk space. The ideal pixel density (PPI) depends on the output format, output device, the intended use and artistic choice. For inkjet printers measured in DPI it is generally good practice to use half or less than the DPI to determine the PPI. For example, an image intended for a printer capable of 600 dpi could be created at 300 ppi. When using other technologies such as AM or FM screen printing, there are often published &quot;screening charts&quot; that indicate the ideal PPI for a printing method.

Using the DPI or LPI of a printer remains useful to determine PPI until one reaches larger formats, such as 36&quot; or higher, as the factor of visual acuity then becomes more important to consider. If a print can be viewed close up, then one may choose the printer device limits. However, if a poster, banner or billboard will be viewed from far away then it is possible to use a much lower PPI.

== Computer displays ==
The PPI/PPCM of a computer display is related to the size of the display in inches/centimetres and the total number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions. This measurement is often referred to as dots per inch, though that measurement more accurately refers to the resolution of a computer printer.

For example, a 15-inch (38 cm) display whose dimensions work out to 12 inches (30.48 cm) wide by 9 inches (22.86 cm) high, capable of a maximum 1024×768 (or XGA) pixel resolution, can display around 85 PPI, or 33.46PPCM, in both the horizontal and vertical directions. This figure is determined by dividing the width (or height) of the display area in pixels by the width (or height) of the display area in inches. It is possible for a display to have different horizontal and vertical PPI measurements (e.g., a typical 4:3 ratio CRT monitor showing a 1280×1024 mode computer display at maximum size, which is a 5:4 ratio, not quite the same as 4:3). The apparent PPI of a monitor depends upon the screen resolution (that is, the number of pixels) and the size of the screen in use; a monitor in 800×600 mode has a lower PPI than does the same monitor in a 1024×768 or 1280×960 mode.

The dot pitch of a computer display determines the absolute limit of possible pixel density.
Typical circa-2000 cathode-ray tube or LCD computer displays range from 67 to 130 PPI, though desktop monitors have exceeded 200 PPI, and certain smartphone manufacturers&#x27; flagship mobile device models have been exceeding 500 PPI since 2014.

In January 2008, Kopin Corporation announced a 0.44 inch (1.12 cm) SVGA LCD with a pixel density of 2272 PPI (each pixel only 11.25μm). In 2011 they followed this up with a 3760-DPI 0.21-inch diagonal VGA colour display. The manufacturer says they designed the LCD to be optically magnified, as in high-resolution eyewear devices.

Holography applications demand even greater pixel density, as higher pixel density produces a larger image size and wider viewing angle. Spatial light modulators can reduce pixel pitch to 2.5 μm, giving a pixel density of 10,160 PPI.

Some observations indicate that the unaided human generally can&#x27;t differentiate detail beyond 300 PPI. However, this figure depends both on the distance between viewer and image, and the viewer’s visual acuity. The human eye also responds in a different way to a bright, evenly lit interactive display from how it does to prints on paper.

High pixel density display technologies would make supersampled antialiasing obsolete, enable true WYSIWYG graphics and, potentially enable a practical “paperless office” era. For perspective, such a device at 15 inch (38 cm) screen size would have to display more than four Full HD screens (or WQUXGA resolution).

The PPI pixel density specification of a display is also useful for calibrating a monitor with a printer. Software can use the PPI measurement to display a document at &quot;actual size&quot; on the screen.

=== Calculation of monitor PPI ===

PPI can be calculated from the screen&#x27;s diagonal size in inches and the resolution in pixels (width and height). This can be done in two steps:

# Calculate diagonal resolution in pixels using the Pythagorean theorem:formula_4
# Calculate the PPI:formula_5
where
# formula_6 is width resolution in pixels
# formula_7 is height resolution in pixels
# formula_8 is diagonal size in pixels.
# formula_9 is diagonal size in inches (this is the number advertised as the size of the display).

For example:
# For 15.6-inch screen with a 5120×2880 resolution you get formula_10 = 376.57 PPI.
# For 50-inch screen with a 8192×4608 resolution you get formula_11 = 188 PPI.
# For 27-inch screen with a 3840×2160 resolution you get formula_12 = 163 PPI.
# For 32-inch screen with a 3840×2160 resolution you get formula_13 = 138 PPI.
# For an old-school 10.1-inch netbook screen with a 1024×600 resolution you get formula_14 = 117.5 PPI.
# For 27-inch screen with a 2560×1440 resolution you get formula_15 = 108.8 PPI.
# For a 21.5-inch (546.1 mm) screen with a 1920×1080 resolution you get formula_16 = 102.46 PPI;
These calculations may not be very precise. Frequently, screens advertised as “X inch screen” can have their real physical dimensions of viewable area differ, for example:
* Apple Inc. advertised their mid-2011 iMac as a &quot;21.5 inch (viewable) [...] display,&quot; but its actual viewable area is 545.22 mm or 21.465 inches. The more precise figure increases the calculated PPI from 102.46 (using 21.5) to 102.63.
* The HP LP2065 20 inch (50.8 cm) monitor has an actual viewable area of 20.1 inch (51 cm).
* In a more significant case, some monitors such as the Dell UltraSharp UP3216Q (3840×2160 px) are advertised as a 32-inch &quot;class&quot; monitor (137.68 PPI), but the actual viewing area diagonal is 31.5 inches, making the true PPI 139.87.

=== Calculating PPI of camera view screens ===
Camera manufacturers often quote view screens in &#x27;number of dots&#x27;. This is not the same as the number of pixels, because there are 3 &#x27;dots&#x27; per pixel – red, green and blue. For example, the Canon 50D is quoted as having 920,000 dots. This translates as 307,200 pixels (×3 = 921,600 dots). Thus the screen is 640×480 pixels.

This must be taken into account when working out the PPI. &#x27;Dots&#x27; and &#x27;pixels&#x27; are often confused in reviews and specs when viewing information about digital cameras specifically.

== Scanners and cameras ==
&quot;PPI&quot; or &quot;pixel density&quot; may also describe image scanner resolution. In this context, PPI is synonymous with samples per inch. In digital photography, pixel density is the number of pixels divided by the area of the sensor. A typical DSLR, circa 2013, has 1–6.2 MP/cm2; a typical compact has 20–70 MP/cm2.

For example, Sony Alpha SLT-A58 has 20.1 megapixels on an APS-C sensor having 6.2 MP/cm2 since a compact camera like Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX50V has 20.4 megapixels on an 1/2.3&quot; sensor having 70 MP/cm2. The professional camera has a lower PPI than a compact camera, because it has larger photodiodes due to having far larger sensors.

== Smartphones ==
Smartphones use small displays, but modern smartphone displays have a larger PPI rating, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 with a quad HD display at 577 PPI, Fujitsu F-02G with a quad HD display at 564 PPI, the LG G6 with quad HD display at 564 PPI or – XHDPI or Oppo Find 7 with 534 PPI on 5.5-inch display – XXHDPI (see section below). Sony&#x27;s Xperia XZ Premium has a 4K display with a pixel density of 807 PPI, the highest of any smartphone as of 2017.

=== Logical DPI values on Android ===
Android supports the following logical DPI values for controlling how large content is displayed:

== Metrication ==
The digital publishing industry primarily uses pixels per inch but sometimes pixels per centimeter is used, or a conversion factor is given.

The PNG image file format only allows the meter as the unit for pixel density.

== Image file format support ==

The following table show how pixel density is supported by popular image file formats. The cell colors used do not indicate how feature-rich a certain image file format is, but what density support can be expected of a certain image file format.

Even though image manipulation software can optionally set density for some image file formats, not many other software uses density information when displaying images. Web browsers, for example, ignore any density information. As the table shows, support for density information in image file formats varies enormously and should be used with great care in a controlled context.

<text>In algebraic geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry is a relationship between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds. The term refers to a situation where two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.

Early cases of mirror symmetry were discovered by physicists. Mathematicians became interested in this relationship around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that it could be used as a tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.

Today, mirror symmetry is a major research topic in pure mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a mathematical understanding of the relationship based on physicists&#x27; intuition. Mirror symmetry is also a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory, and it has been used to understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the homological mirror symmetry program of Maxim Kontsevich and the SYZ conjecture of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow.

==Overview==

===Strings and compactification===
In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.

There are notable differences between the world described by string theory and the everyday world. In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is one dimension of time (later/earlier). Thus, in the language of modern physics, one says that spacetime is four-dimensional. One of the peculiar features of string theory is that it requires extra dimensions of spacetime for its mathematical consistency. In superstring theory, the version of the theory that incorporates a theoretical idea called supersymmetry, there are six extra dimensions of spacetime in addition to the four that are familiar from everyday experience.

One of the goals of current research in string theory is to develop models in which the strings represent particles observed in high energy physics experiments. For such a model to be consistent with observations, its spacetime must be four-dimensional at the relevant distance scales, so one must look for ways to restrict the extra dimensions to smaller scales. In most realistic models of physics based on string theory, this is accomplished by a process called compactification, in which the extra dimensions are assumed to &quot;close up&quot; on themselves to form circles. In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions.

===Calabi–Yau manifolds===
Compactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a Calabi–Yau manifold. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau.

After Calabi–Yau manifolds had entered physics as a way to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.

The mirror symmetry relationship is a particular example of what physicists call a physical duality. In general, the term &quot;physical duality&quot; refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical theories turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory can be transformed so it looks just like another theory, the two are said to be dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities play an important role in modern physics, especially in string theory.

Regardless of whether Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct description of nature, the existence of the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in enumerative algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions. A classical problem of enumerative geometry is to enumerate the rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold such as the one illustrated above. By applying mirror symmetry, mathematicians have translated this problem into an equivalent problem for the mirror Calabi–Yau, which turns out to be easier to solve.

In physics, mirror symmetry is justified on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs that do not require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror symmetry in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists&#x27; intuition.

==History==
The idea of mirror symmetry can be traced back to the mid-1980s when it was noticed that a string propagating on a circle of radius formula_1 is physically equivalent to a string propagating on a circle of radius formula_2 in appropriate units. This phenomenon is now known as T-duality and is understood to be closely related to mirror symmetry. In a paper from 1985, Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz, Andrew Strominger, and Edward Witten showed that by compactifying string theory on a Calabi–Yau manifold, one obtains a theory roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics that also consistently incorporates an idea called supersymmetry. Following this development, many physicists began studying Calabi–Yau compactifications, hoping to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string theory. Cumrun Vafa and others noticed that given such a physical model, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, there are two Calabi–Yau manifolds that give rise to the same physics.

By studying the relationship between Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship. Further evidence for this relationship came from the work of Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau manifolds by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.

Mathematicians became interested in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry could be used to solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas&#x27;s work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.

In 1990, Edward Witten introduced topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory, and physicists showed that there is a version of mirror symmetry for topological string theory. This statement about topological string theory is usually taken as the definition of mirror symmetry in the mathematical literature. In an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994, mathematician Maxim Kontsevich presented a new mathematical conjecture based on the physical idea of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. Known as homological mirror symmetry, this conjecture formalizes mirror symmetry as an equivalence of two mathematical structures: the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi–Yau manifold and the Fukaya category of its mirror.

Also around 1995, Kontsevich analyzed the results of Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a quintic threefold, and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, Alexander Givental posted a paper that claimed to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, so there were doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent proof in a series of papers. Despite controversy over who had published the first proof, these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical proof of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry. In 2000, Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa gave another physical proof of mirror symmetry based on T-duality.

Work on mirror symmetry continues today with major developments in the context of strings on surfaces with boundaries. In addition, mirror symmetry has been related to many active areas of mathematics research, such as the McKay correspondence, topological quantum field theory, and the theory of stability conditions. At the same time, basic questions continue to vex. For example, mathematicians still lack an understanding of how to construct examples of mirror Calabi–Yau pairs, though there has been progress in understanding this issue.

==Applications==

===Enumerative geometry===


Many of the important mathematical applications of mirror symmetry belong to the branch of mathematics called enumerative geometry. In enumerative geometry, one is interested in counting the number of solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of algebraic geometry. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 BCE by the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius, who asked how many circles in the plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, the solution to the problem of Apollonius is that there are eight such circles.
Enumerative problems in mathematics often concern a class of geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials. For example, the Clebsch cubic (see the illustration) is defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.

Generalizing this problem, one can ask how many lines can be drawn on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, such as the one illustrated above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.

By the year 1991, most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish. According to mathematician Mark Gross, &quot;As the old problems had been solved, people went back to check Schubert&#x27;s numbers with modern techniques, but that was getting pretty stale.&quot; The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count the number of degree three curves on a quintic Calabi–Yau. Candelas and his collaborators found that these six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifolds can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of degree three.

In addition to counting degree-three curves on a quintic three-fold, Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians. Although the methods used in this work were based on physical intuition, mathematicians have gone on to prove rigorously some of the predictions of mirror symmetry. In particular, the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry have now been rigorously proven.

===Theoretical physics===
In addition to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are expressed in terms of infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the calculations can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult calculations in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier calculations in the B-model. These calculations are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate calculations in one theory into equivalent calculations in a different theory. By outsourcing calculations to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.

Outside of string theory, mirror symmetry is used to understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics and other parts of theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which are not part of the standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.

==Approaches==

===Homological mirror symmetry===


In string theory and related theories in physics, a &quot;brane&quot; is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions. For example, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. The word brane comes from the word &quot;membrane&quot; which refers to a two-dimensional brane.

In string theory, a string may be open (forming a segment with two endpoints) or closed (forming a closed loop). D-branes are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane. The letter &quot;D&quot; in D-brane refers to a condition that it satisfies, the Dirichlet boundary condition.

Mathematically, branes can be described using the notion of a category. This is a mathematical structure consisting of &quot;objects&quot;, and for any pair of objects, a set of &quot;morphisms&quot; between them. In most examples, the objects are mathematical structures (such as sets, vector spaces, or topological spaces) and the morphisms are functions between these structures. One can also consider categories where the objects are D-branes and the morphisms between two branes formula_3 and formula_4 are states of open strings stretched between formula_3 and formula_4.

In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes are complex submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau together with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one can think of a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.

The derived category of coherent sheaves is constructed using tools from complex geometry, a branch of mathematics that describes geometric curves in algebraic terms and solves geometric problems using algebraic equations. On the other hand, the Fukaya category is constructed using symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics. Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a symplectic form, a mathematical tool that can be used to compute area in two-dimensional examples.

The homological mirror symmetry conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich states that the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent in a certain sense to the Fukaya category of its mirror. This equivalence provides a precise mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. In addition, it provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and symplectic geometry.

===Strominger–Yau–Zaslow conjecture===
Another approach to understanding mirror symmetry was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996. According to their conjecture, now known as the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can be understood by dividing a Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces and then transforming them to get the mirror Calabi–Yau.

The simplest example of a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.

One can choose an auxiliary circle formula_7 (the pink circle in the figure) such that each of the infinitely many circles decomposing the torus passes through a point of formula_7. This auxiliary circle is said to &quot;parametrize&quot; the circles of the decomposition, meaning there is a correspondence between them and points of formula_7. The circle formula_7 is more than just a list, however, because it also determines how these circles are arranged on the torus. This auxiliary space plays an important role in the SYZ conjecture.

The idea of dividing a torus into pieces parametrized by an auxiliary space can be generalized. Increasing the dimension from two to four real dimensions, the Calabi–Yau becomes a K3 surface. Just as the torus was decomposed into circles, a four-dimensional K3 surface can be decomposed into two-dimensional tori. In this case the space formula_7 is an ordinary sphere. Each point on the sphere corresponds to one of the two-dimensional tori, except for twenty-four &quot;bad&quot; points corresponding to &quot;pinched&quot; or singular tori.

The Calabi–Yau manifolds of primary interest in string theory have six dimensions. One can divide such a manifold into 3-tori (three-dimensional objects that generalize the notion of a torus) parametrized by a 3-sphere formula_7 (a three-dimensional generalization of a sphere). Each point of formula_7 corresponds to a 3-torus, except for infinitely many &quot;bad&quot; points which form a grid-like pattern of segments on the Calabi–Yau and correspond to singular tori.

Once the Calabi–Yau manifold has been decomposed into simpler parts, mirror symmetry can be understood in an intuitive geometric way. As an example, consider the torus described above. Imagine that this torus represents the &quot;spacetime&quot; for a physical theory. The fundamental objects of this theory will be strings propagating through the spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics. One of the basic dualities of string theory is T-duality, which states that a string propagating around a circle of radius formula_1 is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius formula_2 in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has momentum as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the winding number. If a string has momentum formula_16 and winding number formula_17 in one description, it will have momentum formula_17 and winding number formula_16 in the dual description. By applying T-duality simultaneously to all of the circles that decompose the torus, the radii of these circles become inverted, and one is left with a new torus which is &quot;fatter&quot; or &quot;skinnier&quot; than the original. This torus is the mirror of the original Calabi–Yau.

T-duality can be extended from circles to the two-dimensional tori appearing in the decomposition of a K3 surface or to the three-dimensional tori appearing in the decomposition of a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. In general, the SYZ conjecture states that mirror symmetry is equivalent to the simultaneous application of T-duality to these tori. In each case, the space formula_7 provides a kind of blueprint that describes how these tori are assembled into a Calabi–Yau manifold.
